2,I liked it better the first time...,"This movie was just okay the first time I watched it, when it was called Free Willy. It might be really fun for kids 10 and younger, but the rest of the gang will be bored quickly. If you'd like a good clean movie for the kids to watch then this is a good one. Otherwise, pass..."
3,Annoying...Boring...Don't Waste Your Money!,The movies okay I guess...not one of the best. At first the water horse is cute but then it grows bigger and ugly. And sometimes I can't even understand what they're saying...because they're in another country or something and because of that I can't understand it very much. It's boring even if you know what's happening. Spend your time on another movie
2,Too scarey for toddlers,"My family and I went to the theater and saw this movie. My kids were very excited to see it due to the trailers and cute advertisements on TV. It did have some cute parts that my kids loved but 1/4 of it was too much for toddlers. My 5 year old actually hid under the seat for a couple of parts. My 3 yr old was more tuff but I don't think she realized what really was happening to the water horse in the end. All in all, parents should read the reviews before you have your younger children watch. The cute parts were not worth the more traumatic for young kids."
5,Heartwarming Movie,This is a great movie for all ages. Hubby liked it as well. We watched this over and over and it never got boring.
3,It's Free Willy,"Not too great of a movie, mainly because it's the same movie as Free Willy except with the Loch Ness Monster. Even freeing the monster by having it jump over an obstacle in the water. Can this be a more blatantly recycled plot?Also, the kid rides the thing's back underwater (somehow holds on) for a long time, and then later on almost drowns just from being in the water. I know it's nitpicking, but come on.Overall, this just wasn't a very touching movie - cute at best."
4,Entertaining - And Not Just For Kids,"I didn't see ""The Water Horse"" in the theater as not many children's movies appeal these days. So I was pleased to discover on DVD that ""The Water Horse"" was crafted with oldschool charm, story, and values as well as topnotch production. The story is simple enough for even young children (although some scenes may be too scary for the very young), but there are also nice touches of sophistication for adults. And when I say sophistication I don't mean thinly veiled dirty jokes, I mean actual drama, humor and story elements that will speak to adults. The special effects are first rate, as is the photography of the stunning Scottish countryside. A real family treat that will stand up to repeated viewings."
4,It's Nesse,A cute and relate-able Nesse tale. It is nostalgic for me and an interesting spin on the whole Nesse tale.
4,The Water Horse,"The Water Horse is a great family movie. It's got everything-myth, war, action, love, comedy and Crusoe. The BD transfer is excellent, accurately capturing the palette of the movie's color scheme as well. Sound is also excellent. Fun and pretty."
4,a legend becomes real,Well done children's story with enough depth for adults. The fanciful beginning for the legend of Loch Ness. Very suitable for even young children.
3,Big Buttons Review- the real thingy,I personally liked this book because I like war realated subjects. the only part about the book that I don't like is that Henk is never told that he is a foster child. If you like war based books you should read this.
5,Good range,My friend has a Nikko boat that doesnt run have as good as my USA. I had to push him in. He ran out of range be the other side of our pond in the backyard.
3,my review,"this boat was good but mine had a crack in back when i bought it. i only had this boat for 2 days then the enigene started stutering going of and on it worked well i loved this boat but it didn""t meet my needs. I recomend that if you like takeing a risk with the quialty of your boat BUY BUY BUY IT! But if you like being safe dont buy it."
4,"interesting movie,","In today's world, we forget how difficult it was in the past, to get an education of any kind if you weren't wealthy"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie because of the subject matter. But it was quite disappointing; a very weak production. That explains, at least partially, why it is not widely known."
3,not as I expected,"Thought it would be a paperback and have more gardening advice , I guess it was more history about how she gotstarted."
2,no work garden,"Rather straight forward book, mulch with hay and no need to weed, somewhat rambling and there are much better garden books, I'm sure she was revolutionary at the time and this will remain a classic but there are better garden books. ER Lindsey"
1,Wouldn't Install on brand new computer,"This product would not install on a 2 week old Toshiba Satelite laptop. My anti-virus kept calling it a Trojan. It went back, and I found a free downloadable version online called Prey. It downloaded quickly and easily, and it protects both my laptop and my android phone!"
3,A little confusing,"Lynds has made some strides in breaking away from simply aping Robert Ludlum's style, but this book has a little too much going on. While it's an entertaining read and does advance Lynds' universe, the plot becomes a bit confusing at times. It would also be nice to have a little more realism as it's hard to believe that the same character can overcome impossible odds quite so often."
3,it was an ok book,"i thought this book was alright..i didnt think stuff would happen as i thought.I didnt know if she was in the goverment.she kept on finding things on poeple like their visa,their driver's license.I didnt really understand this book it was a confusing book,but everything else was alright about the book.couldnt follow with the book."
3,I didn't mind finishing this book...,An interesting plot...and can get excited time to time...Okay to read...
1,Terrible....,"I look for suspense novels with female protagonists, so I was excited to find Masquerade. After reading it for a while I became increasingly disappointed. The writing was at best pedestrian, but that's often to be expected in a mass marketed book. More disappointing was the plot that was predictable from a mile away. I kept reading, hoping there would be a twist at some point that I wasn't expecting, but my hopes were crushed. The book was incredibly formulaic, right down to the requisite scene with the characters lustfully ripping each other's clothes off for a night of passion.The book was just plain dumb. Spend your money elsewhere."
3,Average But Fun,"I think this story line must be one of the top five repeatedly used in the fiction world, because of that I was somewhat hesitant to read this book that a friend recommended. The story does move along and there are some interesting bits. I would say that there is not a lot new here so do not pick this book up if you have grown tired of this plot line. She also worked in the secret agent parts well enough, but again not in a unique way. The cast of characters are straight forward and direct - she really only focuses on a small group. On the other hand if you are looking for a fun book and keeps a good pace, then this is a not a bad read. Overall all a fun book meant for relaxation reading."
2,Too Unbelievable!,"In Masquerade, Lynds' first thriller, she shows some potential and some similarity in style to Robert Ludlum. Overall, however, Masquerade is a book in which I was disappointed and would not recommend. While I am usually willing to suspend belief to a degree in international thrillers, Masquerade just goes out of the stratosphere in this dimension. It's plot, characters and ending are very unbelievable and the dialogue is too corny and unrealistic. On the plus side, Lynds manages to keep the story moving along at a brisk pace and made me want to finish the book to see how it ends. For this reason and her similarity in style to Ludlum, I plan to read at least one of Lynds' more recent works to see if she has grown in her writing skills. Although I did not enjoy Lynds' first attempt as a writer of international thrillers, she demonstates enough potential to warrant a second chance."
4,A good thriller,"I like the plot. It was multi-layered with lots of twists and turns. The characters have believable developments through out the course of the story. The only thing I don't like is the pacing of the story. The beginning was not focused enough. Too many sub-plots floating around, which drags the story too much. I didn't really get into it until I get into the second-half of the story."
2,I've Read Worse,"Thankfully I bought this book in paperback because I would have been quite mad if i'd bought it in hardback. I was expecting a fast page turner and what i got was a book I'm only reading because I haven't anything else to read. The characters in the book are unbelievable as CIA spies, to say the least. Some of the ways they are caught by their enemies are downright laughable. I was starting to think they deserved to be caught. I found myself rolling my eyes many times while reading the book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,Fast paced and Action Packed but Unrealistic,"This is the first book that I have read that was written by Gayle Lynds and it started out very intense and exciting.An attractive female awakens from a long sleep but does not recall who she is. She has been told that she is a CIA agent who has been recruited to hunt down a cold-blooded international assassin who is nicknamed, ""The Carnivore."" However, as the novel progresses, she begins to discover that she's not who she thinks she is. She has become a pawn in one of the biggest government cover-ups and has teamed with a CIA renegade to find out the truth.The story seemed very well constructed but my big problem was with the action scenes. Highly unrealistic action scenes were very distracting and it took much away from an otherwise good story."
5,New mystery/spy author makes good!,"This appears to be Gayle Lynds' first mystery - and what a powerful entry into the competitive field. It never stops being intriguing, exciting, engrossing - and perilous. The international panorama keeps the story moving. The surprise turns and carefully designed twists propel this spy/mystery tale into the tops of the new paperbacks."
4,nice replacement,Replacement part worked just fine. Would have liked to be able to find the part in black but still works good.
2,Marker pen marks on cover,"even though the book was listed as new.there was a prominent blue marker ink from the front cover to the bottom of the book. which means, the blue ink slashed across the bottom of the pages to the back cover of the book."
3,beauty and the beast,"I own the 3"" version of this strap. Beautiful velvet material on the outside, but very scratchy on the edges where the gold and burgundy thread from the pattern overlap the edge. Gotta wear a collared shirt when I wear this strap to keep my neck from getting irritated. If it wasn't for that, I would give it 5 stars."
4,ESham sampler.......for those who don't know him,"This album in my opinion isn't his greatest. I think its more like a sampler since most of the older tracks have been cut off, although there are some new tracks that kick butt... Migraine Headache and P-P-P-Pow are my personal favorites. But, for those devoted ESham fans I'd would agree that this is a partial dissapointment to them although for those who haven't heard him, its a great pick. It gives them a lil' taste of his music, and the Violent J narrations tell you about his history. ESham signing Psychopathic to me is good and bad. I am a fan of them and it does get ESham's material out to more and more, but i really don't want to see him two-tone painted sprayin Faygo on stage....."
2,disappointed esham fan,"I don't know what Esham was thinking with this one. I think teaming up with ICP was a bad idea. I like both ICP and Esham, but keep them separate. On the new tracks, Esham sounds good, but then ICP comes in and ruins each song. This could have been a great compilation album for juggalos who have never really heard Esham. All the songs featured are some of Esham's best stuff, but then they go and ruin them by shortening them so you don't get the whole song. As far as Esham's whole ""religious"" thing that he's doing, I really don't care, just as long as he's doing it for himself and not because ICP told him to. If you are new to Esham and want something better, then get Detroit Dogshxt, or Closed Casket (Esham's greatest album ever)"
2,"GREAT BEATS, HORRIBLE RAP","THIS GUYS ALBUM IS PRETTY GOOD AS FAR AS BEATS GO, BUT HIS RHYMES ARE STALE AND UN INSPIRING, ITS ACTUALLY KIND OF SAD THAT THESE BEATS WERE WASTED. OUT THIS HUGE LIST OF TRACKS I WOULD SAY THERE IS MAYBE 3 TO FOUR DECENT TRACKS, THAT YOU COULD SIT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, BUT THE REST OF THEM HAVE SUCH BAD HOOKS OR LYRICS THAT YOU JUST SKIP IT. HE REALLY HAS NOTHING IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT EXCEPT KILLING PEOPLE AND HAVING SEX WITH RANDOM B!TCHES, VERY VERY OVERDONE. I WISH THERE WAS AN INSTRUMENTAL VERSION, CUZ THAT WOULD BE HOT. ESHAM JUST CALLIT QUITS MAN."
2,A mess.,This isn't an album. It's a jumble of random tidbits of Esham's career that don't flow together at all and annoy the s**t out of you by leading you onto a great sounding song and then going to the next 45 seconds in. Key Tracks - 'Dying To Be Down' and 'The Wicked S**t Will Never Die'. These are of course if you don't mind just a minute to a minute and a half of the song.
2,"Where's Crib Death, Slug Froma45? ICP you failed me!","A great diservice to a deserving artist. While this had about 12 or 13 good songs on it, I could have did without Jays corny ass interludes. I also felt better songs could have been on here. The best thing about this cd is the album art. I'm giving it a 2 based on the album art and the dozen or so songs that I own on cd anyways."
2,NOT A VERY GOOD WAY OF ORGANIZING ESHAM'S GREATEST HITS,"THOUGH THIS CD CONTAINS SOME OF ESHAM'S GREATEST SONGS, IT'S JUST DISSAPOINTING HOW ESHAM CLASSICS LIKE ''RED RUM'', ''THE WICKED SH** WILL NEVER DIE'', ''THE BOOGIEMAN'', ''DYING TO BE DOWN'', ''SILICONE'', AND ''PLAY DEAD'' ARE JUST SO SEVERELY SHORTENED. NONE OF THE OLD SONGS ON THIS COLLECTION LAST NO MORE THAN 2 1/2 MINUTES! I MEAN, REALLY, THIS IS ALMOST HIGHWAY ROBBERY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT! THIS CD'S REDEEMING FACTOR IS ITS 5 NEW SONGS, WHICH ARE NOT AS BAD AS SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE SAID THEY WERE. THE BEST SONG TO LISTEN TO ON THE WHOLE CD IS ''HOW DO I PLEAD TO HOMICIDE?''. MY ADVICE, GET SOME OF ESHAM'S OLD ALBUMS INSTEAD IF YOU WANNA REALLY HEAR ESHAM AT HIS BEST."
4,A journey through Esham's mind!,This album is masterfully composed in a form that feels like you are experiencing the best of Esham from beginning all the way to current music. I completely enjoy this album. Migraine Headache is my favorite song from this CD.
2,i love J and esham to death but...,this was just really bad they really shortened all of his old songs. If they really wanted to have 29 tracks they could've just made it a 2 cd album that way they could play the whole songs.Psychopathic just won't do that for some reason whenever theres a greatest hit cdMaybe if they didn't charge you full price it would'nt be such a rip off. the only reason it's worth gettin is for the new songs
1,NOT A Happy Shopper,"I was not happy with this company, items received were in very filthy dirty packaging....I requested another to be sent because it was for a gift and they still sent another filthy dirty item......It was like a mildew smell as if they kept there stock in a basement...byer beware...I would not by another thing from them!"
1,"Potential for a good book, just potential though","Wissing accomplished the task of flattening the Himalayas with his two dimensional portrayal of the Sheltons, the Chinese, the Tibetans, and the continent of Asia. He glossed over the Unequal Treaties, Opium War, or any other conflicts with the West that would cast doubt on the altruistic motives of the missionaries and ruin his ""feel good"" story. The book lacked any perspective to place the Sheltons in, and thereby deprived a lot of their work of meaning. I was left with no clue that they rode out a two revolutions, that Dr. Shelton was a great diplomat, or even how high up Tibet is, other than an occasional sideways reference. There was a lot of potential for a very good and interesting book about Dr. Shelton, but either by accident or intent it was left with the substance of a ""Chicken Soup"" book."
5,Excellent instructional DVD,"Very well presented, thorough and accessible.A great intro to Kendo with some very insightful advice.This item is also sold in a different cover on Amazon as 'This is Kendo - d' so don't make the mistake that I made of buying both!"
1,Who discovered what was already discovered?,"The doc allocated about one minute to Native crossings along an 18,000 year old Siberian-Alaskan ice bridge. Nothing about subsequent repeated Native crossings either on land or by water and extending as far as South America. The rest of the doc is focused on inferences covering the past couple of thousand years and were often based on a singular questionable written reference or a singular ambiguous artifact and location. A case for Aliens could just as easily have been made given that one can rationalize an ordered pattern in any set of random data. If only those Natives had been resource devouring capitalists the outcome would have been different."
5,accel 9044,These spark plug wires didn't fit my vehicle at all. They were to short in lenght. So they were returned minus the restocking fee.
1,"Good music, bad producer...","The music is wonderful and easy listening and would get 5 stars! But the bad thing is the behavior of the producer, trying to put a copy security on it - which anyway is useless."
2,"MELANIE THORNTON, MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PEACE.","Long live the days of La Bouche. Melanie was the reason why LB was such a powerhouse. I honestly do not like the style of music in this disc. Maybe it's whats popular in Europe but definatly not here. The opening of ""Love How You Love Me"" sounds like something out of Sesame Street!! I liked the Production on La Bouche Albums but on READY TO FLY it just isn't up to par. She could've been big!! If only she would've used better producers. The only song I really like is the Holidays are coming song...a classic Coca Cola commercial! I would only reccomend this to European music lovers. Otherwise pick up items from when she was with La Bouche: SWEET DREAMS, SOS & ALL MIXED UP. Rest in Peace Melanie Thornton. Earth has yet once again lost another gifted singer."
1,Worst_book,"This book starts off with naive examples to illustrate the point. The illustrations were so childy that make it so rudiculous to read and understand it. Later in the book, the explanations get complicated and vague which confuses readers. Some chapters are more than 50 pages long and after you have read it, you will be more confuse than ever.I am a student and need to read a lot of books. This is by far the worst book I have ever read."
3,Yummy but very poor packaging for Dare Breton Crackers,"The low sodium & reduced fat crackers by Dare are the best tasting that I have tried. They are great with savory or sweet and delicious with assorted cheese. I will keep them stocked in my pantry. Unfortunately, they arrived with many broken pieces which I was able to use as topping for salads. I really think Dare Breton is a reliable brand you can depend on. IMHO I think Amazon fell down on the job of preparing them for shipping."
2,Outdated book - More Introductory,"The book is boring and although it gives the perspective of the author and the difficulties of managing an economic development stabilization project, it does not happen like this so much anymore."
4,very insightful,"(Memoir) Account of author's work as leader ofa World Bank project in Equatorial Guinea in1987. Klitgaard provides a nice mix of storiesabout day-to-day life anecdotes and how theWorld Bank interacts with ministers ofgovernment. He's also a very ""groovy"" guy,jamming on the guitar with local pop stars andcontinually searching for good waves.Potentially offensive material: nothing serious"
3,difficult to use,"The display is nothing like what is pictured on the web site. The sharpness, black and white, just isn't there.It does not come with a printed use manual. It does have a manual on a CD if that's the way you like to study a use manual then go for it."
2,defective lcd screen,The lcd sreen had small spots ...than lines that grew to be obvious lcd defect. This is after it was charged and right of the box. I returned it to Amzon for replacment. The Sc card is located behind the battery -very poor location you have to take the battery out to replace SD card. Geocahe cocrdinates uploaded keep coimg out unreadable on device. Not sure what issue was. Called tech service and got the indian call center..hard to understand.
1,worthless,i cannot believe this article made it to print. absolutely terrible. who writes this stuff!!!??? probably someone with too much time and money and not a shred of athletic knowledge. not worth the paper it's printed on.
4,Well composed text book,"A well written book, very helpful for would be financial managers as well as MBA students, who require a sound financial knowledge to move ahead.Has all the financial tables that is required.A must have for all who require a financial base."
5,well-executed idea,"Love the idea of not having to be concerned with a rusted mailbox that needs replacement. Look forward to the product proving its durability in all kinds of weather. I debated between this graphic and one other, but lighthouses are a favored theme of mine, so this one won out. You just place the item over your mailbox, that's the only attachment necessary. The shipment arrived fast."
3,Nice pliers and knife,"This is one of the smaller Leatherman tools. It has a nice needlenose pliers part, and one nice sharp knife blade. There are also a few smaller tools(screwdrivers mostly) which I find difficult to get out using just my fingernails."
3,Okay for price. Blades don't lock.,"Bought this item from Target locally for 21.99. I thought it would be more like my old leatherman. It's not. Still, for the price, it's not bad. Pros: It is cheap. It has a blade. It has a phillips head and standard screw driver. Pliers seem solid and sturdy. I didn't want a lot of extraneous tools (I have never used a saw blade on a pocket knife.) Cons: The blades don't lock. The knife blade is small. The blades open to inside of the handle. I am a skeptical as to whether it would hold up to heavy everyday use from a construction worker or the like. It is fine for my use, occasional fix it and light work. If you are choosing this one because you are low on funds, wait and save up for one of the better models."
4,Very Necessary,"I'm a sailor so a multitool is an essential piece of equipment for me. The tools are great and this has everything I need: a small knife, needlenose pliers, and a bottle opener. So it is very useful and I need it quite often. However, since I work around saltwater pretty much constantly, I need a stainless steel tool. I figured out the hard way that this is not stainless. Also, I would much refer to have a clip than a lanyard ring to attach it to my person."
3,Leatherman Kick multitool versus Victorinox,"I have both the Kick and the Victorinox Multitool.The quality, that means the quality of the steel of the Victorinox I experience is far better. The kick hasn't that best steel.However the tools on my Kick are just exactly what I need and is folded together to stay away form dust. The Victorinox has tools that are not needed much, therefore is havier, also has many corners, is open and therfore sensitive for much dust.For the ease of use I prefer the Kick"
4,"nice item, expected slightly better quality","the features are very good, and the design is excellent. Operation was not as smooth as I would have liked (I had a SOG years ago, and that thing worked great). Some wd40 fixed it up a little, but it has more to do with the construction of the thing."
4,Use it daily at work,Lightweight and easy to use. I carry it with me when at work. No need to go back for your tool bag when you have this on your belt. The compact size is just right in versitility and weight. The contoured grips feel comfortable when using the pliers. Cost a bit more for Leatherman quality but would make a great gift.
3,Solid first timers Multi-Tool,"I've used tons of plier centered multitools as my friends is in the military.I was given the Kick as a birthday gift and it served me well until it was stolen recently along with my car.ProsI love the Phillips head on this tool, it works for virtually everything I've tried on in my car.The knife is very sharp.Measurement on the side is a nice touch.ConsThe Pliers on the kick are decent but I do wish they were spring loaded. The tool also rusted on me after a few excursions to the beach for use with fishing.Also the knife desperately needs a locking mechanism. During one of my uses the knife collapsed closed and deeply cut my finger(1 cm cut).Overall great for the first time user but I reccommend a similar priced Gerber units."
3,"Does the job, but can't match a Victorinox for finish...","Length:: 3:28 MinsServes the purpose as a tool, but just not as slick and well made as a Victorinox... The higher end Leathermans maybe good quality but the difference is with the Swiss Army knives (Victorinox) even the very basic ones (e.g. classic) are made to the same exacting standards... I have a Victorinox Tinker which I prefer to this tool.8 months on: It looks like the main blade has small spots, I certainly hope its not rust forming! I had a look at the manufacturers website and they state it has a stainless steel body and stainless steel Handles, what about the blade and tools? The product description on the amazon page states ""All of the tools available in the Kick are made from 100-percent stainless steel"". I'm not sure, the blade has a matt grey finish which doesn't look like stainless steel to me...Comments from other owners welcome..."
3,"Ok tool, bad packaging, case doesn't fit","You'll need a Leatherman to get this product out of its packaging!Also the included case doesn't fit the product, so I threw it away."
5,Entering a Higher Realm,"Christ Consciousness, Buddha Consciousness, Enlightenment.... the goal of many, achieved by few. Leadbeater gives glimpses into the path to this elevated goal, and I really appreciated the Theosophical insights into the subject. Leadbeater is always one of the best, and I really got something out of this book!"
4,A great deal,"Picked this one up at Amoeba for about $15 - if you're looking for a solid introduction to Bud Powell's middle-period work, this is a great place to start. Also, if you want to know why the guy began to run into some real trouble, the liner notes are very revealing."
2,Hazard!,This album has 2 or 3 ok/good tracks. THe rest is sheer nonsense! This album is to real blues what Diana Krall is to real Jazz.
2,It'll hold your pants up,"This product was inexpensive and will hold your pants up. However, it is not made of one piece of leather and is very difficult to insert and remove from belt loops because of the way it is sown together. This belt can be a real pain in the butt! Pun intended."
5,My Review,"We used to read this book all of the time. It was so cute. My whole family read it together. I have most of it memorized. We lost this book when a flood hit our town, and we really miss it. It's a great book. I'm sad that we don't have it anymore."
5,BIG TIDY UP,"This was a favorite book of both my daughters. After all these years, they can still recite most of the book! I have been searching for copies for my grandchildren."
5,The Big Tidy-up,"I must agree with all the other reviewers, Golden Books needs to re-issue this book. My three girls just loved it everytime I read it to them. Now whenever my grandchildren come over to Naunie's (Greandma's) house, this is the first book they take off the shelf for me to read to them. After three children and soon to be Eight grandchildren, my copy is starting to show some real wear & tear. I would love to buy a copy for each one of them, and was shocked to see that it's not available. Is there anyone out there at Golden Books that can help us.I would be a forever grateful grandparent!"
5,The Big Tidy Up,"This is the BEST book! It needs to be published again. I use it in a graduate level writing class for teachers that I teach. Definitely a topic that their students can relate to. They were so disappointed to discover it is out of print. I also use it in my high school F.L. class before teaching all the chore vocab. My mom and dad can still recite it by heart. Actually, mom gave it to me wrapped at my bridal shower as a way of demonstrating her ""letting go of her little girl."" I can't wait to share my very warn-out but very loved childhood story when I have children of my own."
5,Sounds great!,"These strings are cheap and really worth it. They are better than i expected and made my guitar sound much better, nice tone and really easy to restring with."
1,Incomplete Package,The string that I actually needed was missing from the package so I ended up having to pay for this useless package and also buying another pack locally! Not happy
1,Terrible,"I put these strings not even twenty-four hours ago and they have already rusted a bit and lost their tone immensely. They sounded great for the first few hours of playing, but I was disappointed to see their condition upon waking up this morning. I'm pretty bummed out to say the least."
1,INOP,"Multiple strings broke while trying to tune them, I never got to play them. Stay away from this one, spend a little more on something that will work."
2,Rattling sound,"The lower strings create a rattling sound as you strike them. I've never experienced this before with other strings. So I thought these strings are perhaps too soft and hit the frets, but that's clearly not the case. A musician friend of mine confirmed the same impression. I have to conclude it's the strings that are rattling. I'm disappointed."
2,Predictable,"Meh. A rather predictable storyline. Down-on-his-luck lawyer with a girlfriend that is about to leave him. Office above a bar. Clients that can't pay him. Close friend that is big, strong and happy to throw his muscle around. Antagonist with lots of money and is therefore able to pull off some crazy, highly unlikely things.So, it was like lots and lots of other detective stories--a lot of action and little character development."
4,Goldman's Best,"This is my fourth book I've read by Goldman, and my opinion is that it is his best to date."
1,Deadlocked,"The language is this book is absolutely filty!!!! I was very offended by it. I enjoy good mysteries but I don't think you need to put in such crude language to help the plot. This was my first try reading this author, and I won't read any more of his work. By the reviews, others thought he was great. They must talk that way themselves to not be offended. I am returning all of his novels."
4,Deadllocked,A thrilling story line Character Lou Mason a lot like Jack Reacher with out the physical side but with the witty comments like Reacher I highly recommend have enjoyed two books by this Author now
5,One of My Best,This is one of the best I have. Though the smell does not last for very long hours but its so good that it does not empower you.I recommend it.
3,For the younger crowd,"The ""Individuel"" has been around since 2003. It was produced by the famed French perfumer Pierre Bourdon. I first found this at a Mont Blanc store, tried it and like it. I then ordered it from Amazon where the price was definitely much less. For the past several years I have been using Aqua di Parma, Boucheron, Bulgari and Creed, so I wanted to try something new. Unfortunately, after a few test applications, it did not suit me.The fragrance is Oriental Woody with top notes of lavender, rosemary and pineapple; base notes are sandalwood, amber and vanilla with a touch of vetiver and oakmoss. The scent was too ""sweet"" and some what feminine. It is more suitable for a younger man around the office or even after hours."
5,Impressed!,"I purchased this cologne based on the positive reviews on Amazon and I must admit this product exceeded my expectations. The smell is sweet, masculine and subtle. Every time I wear this cologne I receive numerous complements from women. This cologne can be worn casually or in a formal setting, it never fails to impress. Best of all I guarantee you will be the only man in the room wearing this fragrance."
4,"Good, but nothing great","It's been 2 weeks now since i got this perfume. Have been putting it daily, and smell is good if not great. I read the previous reviews for this perfume and noted that certain people reviews as something phenomenal. The smell is somewhat familiar to me but cannot recollect which perfume has this same smell. I read that Joop smells the same as this but i havnt smelled Joop till now.As far as my taste goes this perfume is good smelling, lasts for somwhere around 4 to 5 hours, can use it for daily office wear. Not too powerful or too weak.Would certainly recommend to people.Only drawback is the quantity, would have been nice if it was a 100 ml rather than a 75 ml, because the price($34 approx) isnt anyhwere near cheap."
2,Not what I expected,"Yes the frangrance is long-lasting but It smells very sweet, very similar to Joop, personally this is not my type of cologne."
5,Excellent cat food!,"We've been feeding our 3 cats Life's Abundance dry cat food exclusively since mid 2005. All remain completely healthy, happy, trim & energetic! They like it and don't overeat even though it is always available to them. They also LOVE the canned version! No digestive issues and few fur balls. I'm completely happy with this cat food."
4,Best Cat Food,Recommended by Vet as a 'healthy' food to try for one of my cats with digestive problems. Can't say it helps with the problem but clearly they all (3) like it better than the brands recommended and sold only by a Vet that we've previously tried.
1,BOYCOTT LIFE'S ABUNDANCE,"Life's Abundance customer service is very rude and will not help customers who have purchased or wants to purchase their cat food.Shipping is too high. When inquired about shipping, they were so rude and told me ""if you want our cat food, you need to pay its price on shipping."" $50 worth of cat food resulted in $30 in shipping.It won't surprise me if all of these reviews were written by the company. This is a very shady company.What happens if my cat has an allergic reaction and customer service won't help?TERRIBLE CAT FOOD, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, TERRIBLE COMPANY."
5,Good Ingedients = Good Product,"My newly adopted cat was having digestive issues. After daily vomiting, I took her to the vet who suggested I try a new cat food. After researching possible food allergens for cats, I settled upon Life's Abundance. Their ingredient list is well put together and the price point is better than the ""fancy Persian food"" that was making her sick. She's all better now."
5,Excellent Cat Food,"Our cats dove into this new cat food. We have seen improved energy, shiny coats and a lot less waste in the litter boxes. Their auto ship program is a great option for multiple cats."
2,"No Wheat Gluten, but not Gluten Free","Life Abundance dry cat food is in the category of 'healthy, low grain' cat foods. It does have brown rice. Before purchasing this food, I read the ingredients, carefully, and could not identify a potential source of gluten in any one of the 65+ ingredients. However, using a reliable commercial test kit for gluten (that is made for the food industry and consumers)this cat food tested high positive for gluten. This test was done because a member of the household who is severely celiac became sick after handling the food and the cat.If you have celiac disease, do not purchase this food. Further, gluten is of no benefit to cats."
5,Simply beautiful !,"I did not know what to expect as there were a few mixed reviews but having such difficulty finding a simple night light with bulb, I decided to try Amazon, my favorite place to shop. I do not like the led night lights at all. I came across this butterfly night light and I am soooo happy I purchased it. It is, simply put, BEAUTIFUL! The lighting is cozy and illuminates the area perfectly. Please do not hesitate to purchase this item, you will not regret it. And no I do not work for Amazon or Seller.I just enjoy giving praise where praise is most certainly due !!"
5,Beautiful!,This is so pretty......I can not wait to put this into my daughters room! We are changing her into her big girl bed and her room will have a butterfly theme. This is perfect!
1,Wagon Train Season 1,"I was anxious to get this DVD set. However the packaging inside the Collector's tin is terrible. My set came with at least three discs scratched because of overly tight cardboard sleeve which are difficult to remove the discs from . There are no plastic trays- the discs are jammed into cardboard pages. I will now have to return the set and decide if I want to try another or get a refund. I hope the set will be re re-released by Timelesss in conventional packaging. I hate to say anything bad about this company , because they've released some great shows including a lot of old TV western . They were ill advised to release this show in this type of package ."
3,Packaging Trouble!!!!!!!!=Playing Trouble!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Who was the BRAIN-DEAD MORON that thought of this packaging idea?They should be fired for doing this,i own both seasons no problem at all with season 2 but season 1 that's another story.I was playing them on my pc at times and the bad disc's locked up on me of which there were 4.I'm just lucky enough to own a Rjtech All-Region Player they played on this with no trouble,i to put them in protective sleeves when finished with them.I can't believe that marketing and inspection let this go by without thinking this through first of how the customers are going to deal with this issue.Getting them out of the cardboard at times was frustrating and that's putting it mildly.Just hope season 3 and all the other seasons don't have this packaging issue.It is not what the customers want they paid big-bucks for this so they expect it to be pristine,myself included with no troubles whatsoever.Other than that,Audio and Video were Perfect."
3,Costly Journey,"I'm glad to see WAGON TRAIN available on DVD. Ward Bond, essentially, made the show, along with Robert Horton. The wisewill buy the years while both of these actors are still featured.One other actor was terrific as well, and I don't mean to discredithim. His name doesn't come to mind just now. In my recollectionhe was more or less Ward Bond's assistant and perhaps his cook aswell?Not having seen any DVDs from this set, I can't give an opinionas to quality of picture, sound, or music. Hopefully, they arewell-done in all of these respects.My rating is primarily based on the price. $70.00 plus is at leastdouble the worth of a complete season of any TV series from thepast."
1,wagon train-season one,"I was excited about this series coming to dvd. However when I saw the price my excitment disappeared and I got angry. No 1 season set is worth that much, especially when you are not sure if or when the next season will come out. I will wait until I am sure that the complete set will be out or the price comes down."
4,Wagon Train,"I found the audio/video quality to be excellent. The dvd's are a little difficult to get out of their holder,but that isn't a reason not to buy the product. The episodes are just as I remembered them."
2,"great series, horrible packaging","I ordered this great series for my husband for Christmas, only to discover that the dvds are damaged because of the lousy packaging design..It's a very tight fitting cardboard sleeve for each disc and they were shoved in there scuffing them in the first place and then when you pull them out to watch them you damage them further! Terrible, they skip, stutter and some refuse to play. I ripped the packaging apart to get the last few out and that kept them from being quite so scuffed up."
5,5 star show 5 star quality but 3 star packaging,Production is good .quality of video is also great . The packaging is poor .The cd is encased in a tight sleeve which is difficult to remove or put back thus damaging the DvD disc. Otherwise the sound and video quality is good but not as good as Rawhide or gunsmoke. Virender
5,best western-,"Any western is great but one that has Robert Horton Is ""BEST WESTERN"". The chemistry between him and Ward Bond make for a great viewing."
1,Shoddy production - buyer beware,"I wasn't around when this TV series came out but I was very happy to see it released and have just started watching it. I noticed other people commenting on the packaging for this DVD set but I've just started on Disc 2 and found it stops half-way through the first episode on this disc and won't replay. Also you can't fast forward or ""rewind"" on this production. I accept the picture quality, but it is not a patch on the Rawhide series. I also believe you need to have chapters or scenes within each episode in the menu. Other than that I'm enjoying the series. Let's see how the rest of the discs play.Update: I'm having trouble with all the discs in this set. Disc 8 is unplayable for all four episodes. I'm finding if I clean each disc with mineral turps it tends to play. I put the cause down to the packaging but the manufacturer needs to address this issue."
5,Classic tv westerns,"Great addition to my collection, Wagon Train was one of my favorite westerns of all times. The stories and plots were great and photography breathtaking. I am certain I will order the rest of this great series."
4,wagon train,The Quality of the DVD picture was excellent. THe sound was usuually good with a few times when noises made words unclear. AS I lreally like old wesrens I greatly enjioyed it.
3,Overpriced for a second hand item,"Having paid $100 for this item, a few days later I got an email from Amazon offering the same item, brand new for half the price"
3,Helpful but lacking revelations,"Prety much your typical how-to for dogs book. I expected to learn more but it's pretty much a beginner book with lots of harsh and critical ""do you really deserve a shepherd?"" righteous indignation. I guess they figure you'd really buy a book about shepherds if you didn't have one???Anyway, it's helpful but certainly not required reading."
1,"Bargain price, cheapo product","I can only blame myself for buying something at a price too good to be true and finding I got a subfusc product -- thin, narrow, no ""loft"", and with the ""hand"" of a cheap dishrag.If you want a soft, quality cashmere, look elsewhere. You'll have to spend more money, but that's better than wasting your time on this piece of black crepe paper and then having to go buy a real cashmere scarve to boot."
1,Not soft enough,"I associate cashmere with softness, this scarf is not soft. No point in paying a cashmere premium on an unsoft scarf. Having said that, I looked for a basic black cashmere scarf for a considerable amount of time and this was the only one I found."
2,The little vacum that couldn't,"I own a lot of Milwaukee tools, among those from most other major brands, and bought this sight unseen. I figured between the reviews, the brand, and the price, it must be a great vac. I was expecting a tornado in a shoe box. Unfortunately, this is the first Milwaukee product I've purchased and been notably unhappy with. Not that it doesn't vacum ok, it does, but for the price I expect it to suck a tennis ball through a 1/2"" pipe...I plan to keep this vac., but only because returning it is more hassle than I have time for. I had hoped I could attach a longer hose and use it with my various sanders, and I'll still try to, but my guess is that the longer hose will fiurther lessen it's suction. As said, in the past I have had blind faith in Milwaukee's products. I'll be giving a second thought to purchases outside their primary product lines from this point forward. This one's a dud."
1,Dust bags tough to find,"Dust bags, cloth or paper, are tough to find for this vacuum. Amazon doesn't sell them and Milwaukee has a $30.00 minimum order. So, if like me, you live in a rural area, better make that original bag that comes with the machine last a long, long time."
4,A great little vacuum,"It's small and it's powerful and very handy. The only negative I have,it should come with more than one bag.John Czop"
5,Love this album; his best ever!,"This album inspires so many moods and emotions it's hard to know where to begin. At times energetic, nostalgic, encouraging, mysterious, optimistic, thought-provoking, romantic, beautiful, arresting, uplifting... This album takes you through a range of emotions and brings you up. The musical style is similar to Mr. Mister, Phil Collins, Luis Miguel, and Julio Iglesias. Emmanuel's melodies and expressions of feeling empower his listeners to process and overcome life's troubles and worries, bringing things back in balance. Fantastic album! This one should come with a satisfaction guarantee, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Sordid Lives - TOPS,The series entitled SORDID LIVES is absolutely one of the funniest series I have ever seen. I only wish the produces would have continuted and extended the series. The characters are all so true to life that you immediately identify with each and every one of them. You can watch this series over and over again and then find yourself using quips and guotes from it in your everyday life!
5,I haven't laughed this hard in ages!!,"I utterly enjoyed this series! I watched the whole series over two evenings, and I could not keep myself from going to the next episode. I literally did not want to go to sleep so I could get to the next one; it was that addictive! I really haven't laughed this much in ages. I have never gone in for the whole laughing at trailer trash sort of thing, but this is so cleaver and over the top. LOVED IT!!! I just wish there was more; there is only one season."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"Sordid Lives: The Series is hilarious! The characters in this series, though exagerated, are great depictions of the extreme white trash of the South. The actors and actresses are very funny in their roles. I wish they had continued this series....great comedy.....very entertaining. Buy Sordid Lives: the movie as well. It clarifies some of the relationships of the characters you see in The Series."
5,Amazing,This is a great show! The only thing bad about this show is that there are no more seasons/episodes!!! Highly recommendable.
5,Love this!,This series is absolutely hilarious. I'm so mad they cancelled it on LOGO! Worth every cent. Hopefully it gets finished!
2,Sordid Disappointment,"I waited so long to see the TV series based on the movie ""Sordid Lives,"" but it failed to meet my expectations. The brightest moments were merely rehashes of the hilarious film."
2,Misleading; Set only hs 1 DISC not 2 as described!!!,This BluRay is only a 1 disc set.Amazon has mislead me to believe the set has 2 discs.
2,disapointed,"I liked the ONJ extras The actors were all great except the male lead his beua and the stalker girl. Not the best written or funniest, but most of the actors rose above it and made it funny. Thank goodness I got a promo copy, everyone else I know who bought this, had DVD's that skipped and had to be returned."
1,What The Hell...........,"Why in the world would a record company take the time to release this onto cd & package it up with a nice slipcase- but not clean up the sound?!? This music was taken directly from really bad vinyl- you get every hiss, pop, crackle and then some with the music. They could afford the packaging, but not the clean up of sound? This gets and deserves one star because the whole point of ""cd"" is that it's supposed to sound better than vinyl."
5,Jinx is the best,"This T-shirt is hilarious and perfect for a roommate of mine who loves to play WoW. Gotta love Jinx, they make some of the best, funniest geek stuff around!"
4,Helpful,I found this book to be not only a valuable learning tool but an excellent reference as well. If you need help using vms this book will do the trick.
2,"So, So","I was somewhat pleased with the item. It was too big for my writst, and I've yet to locate a watch repair shop that can fix it for me. I'll probably end up giving it to someone as a gift. It was in excellent condition, brand new actually. It's just not what I'd expected, but this is a first for me with an online purchase. I'd certainly buy from the seller again, this is not a damper on my purchasing choices with the seller."
2,No ankle support whatsoever,"We bought the girls version of this skate for my four-year-old daughter. These skates are advertised as beginner skates, yet the material the uppers are made from is thin and totally floppy. Ankle support is non-existent. Beginning skaters need ankle support regardless of whether the skates have double runners. Now that I have seen them, I think these skates are overpriced for what they are, and useless for my daughter at any price."
4,"Nice little skates for price, issues with shipping","I ordered these skates for my neice for Christmas. Luckily, I ordered the first pair in early Nov., because for some reason they were returned and my money was refunded, but I never knew why. I contacted the seller, but did not receive an email reply.I accidentally re-ordered them from the same seller, and they did arrive, but only after I used my work address instead of my personal address. So, my personal address must have been the issue, but I wouldn't know, since the seller never responded to my question for help.At any rate, I eventually got the skates the second time, but unfortunately paid for shipping twice due to the issue mentioned above. The skates are nice, quality and my neice loved them. They are especially nice because they have the double blade-which is good for beginners and little kids. Will order another pair for my nephew."
4,daughter loves it,She was skating like a pro at the rink within 30 minutes. The double runner was helpful.
3,Megan's ice skates,"My granddaughter,Megan, is 4 1/2 yrs old and she was thrilled with her new skates for Christmas. She hasn't used them yet, so we'll see how she does with them. It was a very quick delivery just 2 wks before Christmas. I was pleased."
3,Ok for a starter pair,"My two-year-old daughter received a pair of these as a gift. They don't seem to have too much ankle support. Also, the pair she got was a size too big. We beefed up the ankle support with foam shoe insoles, trimmed to fit 3/4 around her ankle (in the back). That, plus the double-runner design gave her a pretty stable skate. On top of it, she had a blast her first time out."
3,So SO,The skates do the trick for $30. Kind of flimsy material - nothing stiff about it for ankle support - but just double sock it and your kid will be fine. Really easy for our daughter to stand up.
3,English Not So Good,(1)Distillation: Flow rates only decrease as one goes up the columb not down as this text states. Distillation is driven by the reboiler not the condenser. (2) Chemical reaction equations don't balance
2,Didn't work for me,I ordered this years ago. I never noticed any difference in my energy level. But different things work for different people.
4,Great Look - Just a little snug,"I love it. It's a great color and fits what I need. It comes with the basic (removable, plastic) picture/card holder but it's a little difficult to snap close with it in. I keep my ID in the 'window' slot, 3 cards in the credit card slots and there's space for a couple more in the 4th slot just behind the 3 (visible) card slots. There are 2 snap locations if you need just a little more room to be able to close the wallet but it's not much extra space. This wallet will hold your dollar bills, a few coins and a few cards just prefect."
3,You get what you pay for,"I got this wallet when it was around 14 dollars, so it was worth it, but if you are looking for a wallet that will last for a while, i suggest you look further.It is a useful wallet if you just want to stick something in your pocket for a day but it does not hold a lot. Seeing as i have a lot less to carry - just money and a debit card (no id, credit cards, etc) it's perfect for me, but for anyone else, it wouldn't be an everyday wallet."
2,small Rolfs wallet,"This wallet is very small, only holding 4 credit cards. It has a small change holder on the back which is hard to use. The main problem is the inside fold under the flap is already tearing. Would not recommend this wallet to anyone."
4,Handy wallet,"Bought the red one. Perfect to hold about 4-5 cards, some cash and coins. Looks pretty good as well (same as it appears in the picture)."
5,My mom loves it,"My mom was carrying loose credit cards and cash when she was using small purses. She really needed a small wallet. I searched around and finally found this one. It is perfect, not very expensive, and my mom loves it. I recommend it for those tiny purses we all have to have."
3,Nice but not lasting,"I got this wallet about six months ago, and I liked it really much -- it is small, but holds everything. However, it got a big hole now, so the coin holder became completely useless."
3,rip in fabric,I've used this walled for about three months now and have liked it until today. I discovered it's leaking change. The fabric has pulled loose from the stitching along the edge of the wallet. Bummer. I like Rolf wallets but I don't think I'll buy this particular version again.
3,Like the look but.....,"While the outside of the wallet is leather, the inside is not and startedcracking as soon as I started using it."
3,Small,"It was too small for my needs, but keeping it in case I need it for something else sometime in a smaller purse. VERY sturdy!"
5,two for one deal,"This is a great book, and has Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" and Karl Von Clausewitz's ""On War"" both are great books, and if you love war you will love this and see how a lot of battles where won and lost."
4,War Maniacs will enjoy,This book is for the total war maniac. If you are interested in the subject this book is for you. It is defintly worth your money. It explains a lot about his thoughts ideas and other things. It did get a bit tedious though......
3,Avante-Garde Prose Manifests,"I applaude Jack Kerouac is Pregnant for a variety of reasons. The sarcastic, wry wit that gleams through the pages is evident after obvious examination. And the incredible, massive madness that seeps through the corners of the deliriously delightful assortment of plays. Carry on, Aurelie Sheehan. Be great."
3,"Not Bad, but some very odd spots","This album is not bad at all. I didnt actually buy it, i listened to it from a friend's house who has almost every bjork cd in her bjork collection, lol. I would personally rather just have works of Bjork herself than on tribute albums, because something about tribute albums are either odd, weird, and very cheap and cheezy. However, this wasnt that bad, some of the songs actually captured the essence of Bjork's songs, which is a plus. The only downside is that many songs just don't work for strings, and it makes me wonder why they chose some of the songs that aren't necessarily appropriate for strings (such as Army of Me, which sounded horrible in the beginning, but okay along the way, You've Been Flirting Again, and Big Time Sensuality). But all in all this is an okay CD, its interesting... but why not have the real thing? I wouldn't really waste my money on this when i could just appreciate the essence of Bjork from Bjork herself."
1,"Poor Quality : ""no disc"" Error after 14 months","We purchased a Sony CFD-E100 Portable CD Radio Cassette Recorder directly from the Sony Style outlet store. It worked great for 14 months. Now it will not play CDs saying ""no disc"" error. I contacted Sony technical support. They were apologetic and polite, however, would only offer flat rate repair or exchange for a refurbished unit per their website. This will end up costing as much as a new one! I tried different discs and cleaning as others have suggested but nothing helped. We are VERY disappointed in Sony quality and product support..."
2,Back luck twice,"I purchased this item and within 6 weeks and without a lot of use, the CD player quit. First the sound went in and out and then the no disc sign appeared. I sent it back to try again. It had shipped from Dependable Resource and they were FANTASTIC! I just received my second one and the cd player refused to play on the VERY FIRST CD. Again the no disc sign. So it is going back again and this time I am asking for a refund. But what a pain! The size was great for my kitchen and the sound just fine. But I purchased the item to be able to play CD's in my kitchen. Obviously, that I cannot do. Buy at your own risk."
5,Nifty little machine,I have not tried to record an audio cassette yet but it is nice to have a machine with that capacity especially in a single deck design. The other components -- radio and cassette and CD playback -- work fine. This is a cleverly designed and attractive machine and I am very satisfied with it.
4,pleased with both product and service,"Ordering my Sony CFD-E100 Portable CD Radio Cassette Recorder was a pleasant experience from beginning to end. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I am very satisfied with its performance. Have used the cassette player, the CD player and AM and FM radio. I appreciate the stereo option and the bass boost option. It fits quite nicely on my kitchen counter and, unlike other players, is small enough but still has a full resonant sound."
4,Good Sound,"This radio/CD/cassette player is holding up in a house remodeling project. It has very good sound,even when turned up REALLY LOUD. Sometimes the CD skips or pauses but only when nearby banging or dropping of objects occurs. It would be nice if the radio tuner didn't stop at every station along the way, or maybe I just don't know how to use it yet. No manual came with it. Perfect size. It was on the expensive side,though."
4,Excellent Package,"I bought this just last week. Amazon's delivery was on commited time. I was looking for a small, compact CD player that also have radio and cassette player. This Sony CFD-E100 exactly fit my bill. I have following observations to make for this player:Pros:1. Nice looks, compact size.2. Good audio quality, for CDs and Cassettes.3. Nice FM reception.Cons:1. You won't be able to preset FM channels without reading manual.2. MegaBass is not that effective (if you are not audiophile, it is still good).3. No MP3 support, this would have been great otherwise."
5,Pleased,"This compact player looks good and sounds good--both are important to me. I'm still getting used to the way it opens in the front, but that's a minor detail."
2,Junk,"After only three weeks of use, the sound would go from low to high on its own without any user adjustment. Quality is lousy, price too high. Junk! Don't buy!"
1,Poorly made,I bought one of these last fall but unfortunately lost the receipt and didn't buy it from Amazon. By January the CD player had failed and as of this morning the radio doesn't work either. I would call this a good looking piece of junk. Not one of Sony's better efforts.
5,Great Buy,"I like the book it is a great reference tool when you are using MLA, APA style formatting."
4,A writer's reference,This book is required for my online English Composition and it has been helpful for online editing and critiquing. Best part is that Amazon shipped it fast so I got it in one day!
1,Yuck!,I bought this book last week and I have barely put a dent in it! It is really bad and I am having a hard time reading it. I doubt that I will finish.
1,Pure,"Ugh. What a waste of time. I also picked up this book because of the back cover's recommendations. I spent the whole time saying, 'Do British girls really grow up that differently than American ones? Would parents really let a supposedly 27 year old man take their 14 year old daughters virginity right upstairs while they watch tv? Do I really believe that some girl is going to cut herself up and let boys feel her up when her family life is not that bad?' (Her parents argue, but there is no mention of sexual abuse.)I just found everything so irritating and unbelievable. I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated that I wasted the time it took to get through this mess. Not once did the author generate any sympathy for the main character. Maybe that was her intent. How does a 16 year old come up with this ugliness? (I also really enjoyed She's Come Undone and I found no similarities between the two.)"
2,Good Writing Talent/Bad Character Development,"I thought Pure was going to be a touching coming of age story. It was not. Rebecca Ray seems to have talent as a writer-this was easy reading and I got good visuals of the characters, the setting and what was going on around them. However, the characters remain static throughout the entire book. Maybe that is why Rebecca Ray chose not to name the narrator/main character-we never really get to know her. All we see is her quirks-her apologizing and men abusing her, but we never get to see why. She cuts herself up, literally, but this is not explored any further. The family is dysfunctional from beginning to end, but all we end up with is a 400 page snapshot of examples of the dysfunctionality without any insight or resolution. The ending is abrubt and without conclusion, resolution or insight. I feel that Rebecca Ray is promising and capable of great things, but she needs a little development."
3,"Nappies, bumpershoots and trainers","I am amazed at the accomplishment of a 16-year-old writer, but I must also say that her youth showed. If you are expecting a sophisticated novel that uncovers a series of great truths, you will be disappointed. But if you want an entertaining, quick read or if you like raw coming-of-age stories, this could make good beach reading.Ray captures the awkward moments of growing up, the clumsiness of sexual experimentation and adolescent attempts to fit in.I got hung up on some of the British dialect. To really understand this book you gotta be a Brit. I still don't know what ""skin up,"" ""D&T"" or ""QED"" mean."
1,Don't Bother,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. IT STINKS. It leaves you hanging. It changed half way through. She didn't learn anything from her mistakes. The parents could have been more protective and they could have been a little more up-set about the 27 year old who turned out to be 31. The only reason I finished the book was because I thought she may learn from her mistakes and find someone her known age. But no.
2,If you like the movie Thirteen,"I worked at a bookstore and while straightening up I came across this book. Thought it seemed rather interesting so I bought it. Even with my discount I was still mad that I had wasted my money on this book. I did read it til the end and I do realize that this was her first novel but, when I finished the book I actually closed it, stared at it, and promptly threw it across the room. The characters never seemed to develope and the ending made me angry. I hated how it just ends. It wasn't that it was disturbing what happened in the novel I just kept reading trying to figure out what these characters are all about. I wouldn't read this book again if you paid me. But then again that's my humble opinion."
1,go back to school rebbecca,ok im pretty confident this is the worst book ever written. i will sum the plot up for you now:____o wait there isnt one unless u call a girl that likes to be abused by herself and guys a plot and to think this was written by a girl who dropped out of high school who woulda guessed? this would have made one hell of a stay in school campaign
4,I like it,"I like it maybe because im a young one. it kept me glued to the book and also snickering away from it. the lessons she learned are ""pure""."
1,"Cheer up, angry teen!!","You'll be an adult before too long, and you'll learn to write about adult relationships and adult feelings in a less trite, one-dimensional way!! You will see that people have more emotions than GLOOMY, PISSED OFF or HOPELESS! It's true!! Hang in there another 5 years or so, and you'll be grown up enough to feel a feeling besides cliched despair!!!"
1,blech.,"This book is 400 pages of complete [junk]. I couldn't even finish it. I was on page 100 something, but I just got so frustrated at how horrible it was that I threw it on the floor. I can't even explain why it's so bad. It just.. is. Trust me on this one. And, unless you're English or familiar with the English lingo, it is very hard to understand."
1,DISTURBING!!!,"I was disturbed with the story, seeing as the author was 16 when she wrote the book. The story was vulgar and certainly not typical of anybody's teenage years. As I read the story I wondered if Ray was crying for help from her own internal torment. I also was unimpressed by the direction of the story. It seemed more like several pages from a troubled girl's journal than a published story with a message, lesson, or depiction of something one could learn from. There were no hints of the depth of the characters in her family, in which to point to the dysfunction of the whole family system. Through the book Ray defends the father character and offers no glimpse into his private hell. The mother and brother are barely explored; the author herself never offers much more of her own character than the few tidbits of emotion coupled with pain, rape, or abuse."
1,Awful!,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read, apart from the books I was forced to read in school. The first line was a catcher (""I was about thirteen when I started letting the boys feel me up""). The rest of the book wasn't about anything. The ending wasn't a conclusion to the nothing, the book just stopped. I am appalled that the book got a publishing deal. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
1,let down,"I saw this book and thought i would give it a try because the first page or so looked interesting, and it caught my attention that the author dropped out of school at 16 to write this book. Maybe she should have stayed in school, or at least, take a writing class. I don't know how things like this get published. She goes on for 3-400 pages about descriptions that aren't even important, she brings up subjects about how she likes to be pushed around or hit by her 31 year old boyfriend when she is 14 or how her best girl friend appears to be in love with her, but she doesn't reach any farther than that. its as if she got tired of writing and decided just to let things lie as if it would be more ""mysterious"" or something. I kept on with it, giving it a chance, hoping it would get better, but i reached the end and felt sad when I could have been reading something better. Too vague, too long, too bad. :("
1,"Huge let-down, to say the least!","I agree with the reviewer who said that so much was left unexplored, although I did not find it to be an easy read. I had to talk myself into picking it back up just to get the thing over with. I also agree with the reviewer who posed the question of ""who would allow their 14 year old daughter to spend the night with and continue to date a 31 year old?"" So unrealistic! Highly unlikely turn of events. Huge issues here that were laid out too simplistic in platform, in other words, there were many issues that were left without reason or resolution. For example, why do the parents fight so much? The best friend's relationship with dad seemed really odd, yet 14 year old really didn't take issue with the relationship between her dad and friend--very highly unlikely! I remember when I was 14. I don't agree with the reviewer who draws comparison to ""She's Come Undone,"" for there is no comparison in my opinion. Waste of time and money--don't bother."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be very disappointing. I had hoped that it would at least be interesting because the writer was so young. I grew to hate the characters more and more as I read this book. I wanted to finish it just so I wouldn't have to deal with them and their absurity any more. I didn't even have sympathy for the main character even though I engaged in plenty of distructive behaviors as a teen, including cutting. Is it just me, or are all of the characters a little mentally delayed? Excuse me but is it not completely disturbing that her parents were letting her ""date""-if you could call it that- a 27 or 31 yr old! I've been to England, I find this very hard to believe and just could not get past this."
3,A little too depressing,"I was rather surprised by this book; it wasn't anything like I'd expected. I hadn't thought it would be so sad or disturbing. The climax and conclusion feel as if the author stopped writing a few pages too soon. It was missing a resolution that it desperately needed. That said, Pure is not a bad book, but I personally don't recommend it, unless you like rather depressing books."
1,crappy book,"i was supper excited to read this book because i am a teenager myself, but the book has absoutly no point, all it is is about a 14 yr old girl who is a slut, and the book just randomly ends. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WIH THIS ONE!"
4,Well written but WEIRD,The writing is excellent but the story is just so graphic and shocking that you cant help but finish the book in one day! Its definitely for those with a sense of adventure!
3,unusual and strange,"As I started this book it took me a long time to get into it, and by the time I was done I was still really not into the book itself. It is more interesting than anything else. It seems as though a 16 year old author should not be writing like the things she does and I found this to be most disturbing. Overall I would tell others to read the book simply to see how strange and twisted it honestly is!"
1,Waste of my time,"I really though this book was going to be good.... then I read it. I was the biggest waste of time ever. I cant believe the author dropped out of school at 16 to write this junk. I really enjoy reading and if I start a book I cant stop until its finished, every moment of reading this was agony. Everytime I stopped reading i yelled out, ""I HATE THIS BOOK."" when I finished it I threw it across the room and was truely dissapointed. Bad ending, bad stroy, bad everything. I'm sorry, but that's how I feel..."
2,"Interesting views, but obscured by prose","Disturbing as it may be, the author certainly has a point. Life isn't always as beautiful as we may believe it to be, and this awakening is traumatic but necessary. The only problem with this moral is that it's nearly impossible to find.Ms. Ray does an excellent job of imparting the narrator's emotions though voice and mannerism, capturing the angst of a confused fourteen-year-old. The only problem with this is that it's nearly impossible to understand what's being said for lack of readable sentance structure and over-abundant cursing. More than once, I found myself re-reading pages to figure out what had just happened, and by that time, the action had been completely interrupted.In short, the novel was an excellent ""snapshot"" of a confused teen, but as a story, I found it somewhat lacking."
1,a sad use of talent,"While I will admit that the author has talent, I cannot grasp what made this book appealing to previous reviewers. The best I can say for it is that I felt compelled to finish it, but I don't know if that is due to the book, or my personality. I found the book depressing, pointless, cliche. I had hoped to read an intersting view of adolescence--or at least a good story--this book encompassed neither. Instead I had the impression of reading a text of a young woman's fantasy of neurosis and sexuality, complete with clueless and inept parents. I realize this happens in life; I don't want to read about it if the author has no depth or twist or basic interest to add to the mix. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,Yikes. Yeah. That bad.,"How bad was it? It was awful. The main character is alarmingly unintelligent and ignorant, living life through a fog. And 14 wasn't so long ago for me, and I recall being lightyears ahead of this girl in maturity and just common sense. It's odd that a young author would choose to portray the character as so niave. And unlikable - absolutely no redeeming value here as a person. None of the characters struck any chord or became real whatsoever. And the constant vulgarities and grimy descripties of acne and dirty nails and greasy hair is not great writing or some sort of stark realism. - It was just unattractive and unimaginative and uncompelling. Honestly, the entire book was a waste of money. I hate to be so brutal, but it really infuriated me the entire time I read it."
2,pointless,This book is completely pointless. There are no chapter breaks so it feels like a long run-on sentence. The characters are never fully described and seem two-dimensional at best. I honestly do not understand the glowing reviews this book has received.
1,one of the worst books i've ever read,"This book interested me because it's written by a teenager, but it is horrible. It's poorly written and insulting to teenagers--the main character is a complete idiot, and I spent the majority of the book thinking about how stupid she is and how much I hated her. She repeatedly makes poor, self-hating decisions, and I found it impossible to sympathize with her. I'm so sick of these books that are supposed to ""realistically"" describe the teenage experience but that end up making teenagers look like a bunch of stupid jerks. Maybe my experience was just completely different from the author's, but I don't think it's realistic at all for a 14-year-old to date a 27-year-old or for her parents to accept it."
3,Anticlimactic,"THis book hooked me pretty early on, and it was really easy to read. There were a lot of elements in the story that were a bit unrealistic, but for the most part the plot was very believable. The ending however, was a huge disappointment. There's so much buildup and it just fizzles out. No questions are answered, nothing is resolved or explained really...it made it seem to me like I had read the whole book all the way through only to find that the last chapter was ripped out. I don't like open endings like this, and it kind of ruined the book for me."
2,no thanks,"I am amazed that Rebbecca Ray dropped out of school at the age of 16 to write this novel. I think she has extreme talent, especially for someone of her age. She certainly knows how to create visuals and illustrate her characters. However, the main character was a little cliched, and there was no resolution, it just ends. I found myself slightly bored, and not liking the fact that there were no chapters. Everything just ran together and became jumbled. I will definitely read Rays next novel. It's just that do we really need another coming-of-age story about a 14 year old with some serious issues?"
2,pure awful,"the worst thirteen dollars i ever spent. i was fooled by the interesting looking back and front cover and thought it would be a good, realistic book. the first hundred pages or so was pretty good but then it got old. i was tired of the girl saying, ""im sorry, im sorry, im sorry"" all the time and i hate the ending, it looks unfinished. i wish there was some sort of sequel to it."
3,Dark... disturbing... well written,"This book was really disturbing. The cover makes it seem like its a happy story about a young girl but it turns about to be about a sick pre-pubescent girl who mutilates herself, allows other to touch her and gets into abusive relationships. Its very troubling to read.On the other hand, the author does depict the girl and her story very realistically. Although the subject matter is kind of perturbing, it is very well written."
3,"Predictable, but not half bad","It's not promising: a bored, desperate 14 year old adolescent girl, a 31 year old alcoholic semi-psychopath (not because he likes 14 year olds - that's the least of his problems: he's as much of an adolescent as she is), embarrassing ""left-wing"" anachronistic parents, and some concepts learned in Psychology 101 (a lot of myths, but nevermind) is the substance on which this novel rests. Yet the writer is close enough to adolescence and smart enough to pull it off so that the form reads true. You get the sense of emptiness and self-destructiveness that marks some adolescents' lives. If you can overlook the mega-cliche of the entire book being a ""cry for help,"" there's some valuable stuff here. Ray speaks with the voice of an adolescent, which is pretty rare in fiction."
1,Unbelievable and Undeveloped,"Generally, I don't write reviews but this book called me out to do so. I thought it was completely unbelievable that a 14 year old would be allowed to date a man in his 30's right under her parents nose. There was nothing in the story to make this believable in anyway. These weren't parents who were unenvolved in their childrens lives or consumned with work outside the home where this could go unnoticed. They were completely aware and even let the man stay overnight in their home. Why? This book gives the reader nothing to explain why this would happen in that home.The characters where underdeveloped and their was no redeeming factors in any of them. They weren't fully developed characters. I kept reading thinking at some point it's going to be explained or tied together. It never happened. When I finished the book I felt very disappointed and unsatisfied."
5,MOTH SMOKE by Mohsin Hamid,"Hamid is an excellent writer. Sentences flow smoothly and the settingis most interesting for an American reader. MOTH SMOKE AND THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST along with Durrani and Hosseini's work is essential to understanding a culture quite different from our own. This kind of understanding is essential if the West is to learn that ""our"" view ofthe world is not necessarily the best one."
5,The Story of You and Me,"The most beautiful quality of this book is that despite the odd situations the central character puts himself in, like striking an affair with his best friend's wife, rolling joints while driving on main roads, living in dismal conditions and much more, throughout this book you feel that you are reading about yourself, the people around you, just another face in the crowd. In short this book epitomizes beautifully the fact that every person's life is a story, a remarkable, matchless tale. Definitely one of my favorite books."
5,irresistable pakistani noir,"the downward spiral evokes the doomed heroes of david goodis -- just absolutely great stuff! no let-up, no disappointment, no wavering through the end. a very strong, interesting female lead as well. i can see why the author now lives in new york; no way they'd let him get away with this sort of thing in pakistan."
3,Is it generalized?,"No doubt it is a good novel. It has captured the decaying society of the selective rich and their attaches quite well. However, I believe it portrays the class which in neither open nor acquiescent to a common Pakistani. The reader should bare in mind that Hamid's attempt is enlighten the Pakistani-Americans and Pakistanis who have not yet been exposed to Pakistani mile high club, to the rotting of ideological beliefs, weakening of moral standards among the newly rich (no-doulatiya) and a further decrease in the welfare of proletariat and sub-proletariat in Pakistan."
2,A decent first attempt,"""Moth Smoke"" isn't bad for a first novel, and the premise is interesting enough-- the Mughal fratricides that Pakistan appears to be re-living, in just about every sense of the word, including (but not limited to) the fratricidal nature of relations with India. There is at times a suggestively cinematic quality to the book's structure (e.g. the interludes, set in the present), though I don't think these work as well as the author would like them to. Ultimately, the book is emotionally ""thin,"" and doesn't begin to fill the grand historical trappings its author has laid out."
5,wow,"OK, I have to say I heard way too much about this book before I read it: hot new author, the latest South Asian, Salman Rushdie legacy inheritor, blah, blah, blah...BUT for once, the hype was worth it: truly lyrical, nicely done, rookie of the year this guy: congrats. I love the works of Coetzee, Gordimer, Rushdie, Garcia Marquez, and if this guy keeps it up, I think he could make it into those ranks before this is all over..."
3,Didn't hold my interest till the end.,"I love reading historical fiction and books set in foreign countriesbut this story didn't hold my interest. I didn't care for the charactersand having too many books in my pile, I didn't finish it."
4,Can a novel instruct geopolitically?,"This was a summer read and many times since the events of September 11th, I have brought back images of this story to help me understand a view of the world filtered through the Pakistani lens. The other reviewers are more eloquent about its virtues as a novel, but ""Moth Smoke"" is also a journey through Pakistan in a journalistic and political sense. I think it will transform the one dimentional Middle Eastern mosaic reflected in most U.S. newspapers."
5,good book,read this book. one of my all time favorites. actually. it is my all time favorite. touching all the way through. i felt like daru was my pakastani counter part.
3,Deterioration,"Having managed to claw his way into the middle class, a young man falls into destitution when he's fired from his job at a bank. The book traces his physical and moral deteriorations through a love affair with his best friend's wife, which is, as usual, unconvincingly depicted. However, the character's voice is compelling and the book has a propulsive downward energy that keeps us reading to the end."
4,cross country art history,"Back in 1999 or 2000, my friend Aaron loaned me this book. I read it cover to cover on a bus trip from Mobile, Alabama to northwest California. (I was supposed to get a flight home, but my other friend, Travis, backed out the deal at the last minute.) Now I'm getting a PhD in Art History. Not that this book particularly inspired me to do this, but it IS where it all began. Thanks Aaron!"
5,heavy duty,very impressive tool lots of power. as long as you go from a edge or have room for the inital hole it is really fast and accurate. nice addition to the arsenal.best price i could find anywhere ordered on a friday afternoon and had on monday.
4,Now It Can Be Told: The Story Of The Manhattan Project,Reasonably good read. Tremendous detail. Would have appreciated more science. Difficult to wrap ones mind around the HUGE scope of this program and the short time involved. Great respect for L R Groves!
4,Positive,A great read showing what can be done when you have the desire and the right person. Truly we could not accomplish this now with the leaders we have.Gen Groves deserves all the credit he never got.
4,"Excellent insider view of history, starts off dry","Groves presents the story of the Manhattan Project from the outset of the project through the bombing of Japan and follows-up with the post-war years. The first third of the book is very dry. There is a lot of discussion about construction and personnel that goes on and on, but don't give up! Once Groves gets past this the book really gets interesting. The workings of the project, the dealings between the scientists and the military men, the description of the lengths they went to to keep this gigantic mission secret are all fascinating. Groves himself comes across as an interesting man. While there is not a lot of emotion expressed, the persistence with which he pursued the goal, and his thinking along the way, say quite a lot about Groves. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the Manhattan Project."
4,How to pay attention to detail,"After reading the Making of the Atomic Bomb, I thought I would get a view point from on of the actual participants. General Groves had an eclectic story keeping all his crazy scientists in line to meet an objective. Then handing the construction of the facilities and checking on the progress of the Germans.It was interesting to see how he handeled the new recruites as well as the intelectuals. I enjoyed learning about how Handford was set up to be all automated, most books you only hear about Oak Ridge. I thought their willingness to try every avenue to get to the enrichment process seemed desprate. They were afraid that Germany was so far ahead. They took what they knew and were constantly trying to improve on it.I like learning about the spys that he had under his command to see where Germany was and not to give up and complete his task when he found out there was not any progress in Germany.He was an interesting character who got the job done."
3,This Album Moves,"This is a very calm and deep house or ambient album, but if you like ambient you'll like this album.There is offcoarse a few tracks thats not that good but the ones thats good is really good.You have to get used to them.You won't like this album if you're not Trance,Ambient fan.Please do yourself a faviour and listen to this album.You might just Like it.Cheers"
1,Worst Cordless We Ever Bought,"This phone was just awful! When we bought it, we kept being unable to get a dial tone, and frequent calls to tech service did not help. Each person I spoke to said the others didn't know what they were doing. I finally realized, after doing everything they said, that the phone wasn't making contact with the base, and when that happened it wouldnt give a dial tone when we picked it up. You had to slam it into the base as many as 7 or 8 times to get it to contact. Then it wouldn't charge, or hold a charge. There is a remote ""locating"" tone, but that doesn't work either, because it beeps more loudly at the base station than the phone does, so you can't hear the phone's sound if they are both within hearing range. This phone was a complete waste of money."
5,Reveiw of In The Spirit by Susan Taylor,This is truly one of the best books I have ever read...My first copy was from 1994 and I have been sending it out for gifts for the last 15 years...It is always on my top 5 list and I find myself reverting back to specific chapters when needed...thank you to Susan Taylor for being a constant reminder of the blessings in life...
5,"WONDEFUL, BOOK","I really like that book ,so much cause it really help me in the problem with my office and life in could you write another book like that very soon. it is my third time reading that book over and over again."
5,Thought provoking,"Thought provoking book that will take you to a place of stillness and spiritual peace. Sharing this with a trusted friend will help you open up to a life greater than your present situation. Living in a spiritual way that keeps you in touch with your inner self, will be further enhanced by this book. A must read for those in the midst of struggles and those who have found their inner peace."
2,I Must Live In A Tin Can,"I cheaped out and got this answering machine for [$$] as a temporary until I got a better phone/answering machine. Boy, I guess price really does count. The look is ok, although big for a digital machine. It was easy to hook up. The machine has scarce features, which is expected in a low-end model. It has a blinking indicator to let you know that either you have messages or that your battery is low; it's up to you to determine which. It doesn't have a way to erase messages... they get erased when another message records over them. Not so great if you have something on your machine that you don't want someone you live with to listen to. Finally, the big whammy..... sound quality. It was horrible. It made me sound like I was in a fuzzy tin can. It went straight back into the box and is going back to store. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone."
1,"No good, buy something else","It looks nice, but doesn't work nice. It seems like I'm putting a new 9 volt battery in it every few weeks. Never could save messages and after playing a message, listen good and have your pen and paper handy because they get lost."
5,Yankee Polo Shirt,I purchased this shirt for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Great quality material and just overall nice shirt. Would recommend to anyone and would reorder from this company again.
4,Great birthday present,"I bought this doll house for our 4 year-old's birthday. She has been very active in the past play-acting, playing with her Barbies and Disney dolls. We didn't buy the dolls made for this house, but bought bathroom, bedroom and living rooms. The Barbie and Disney dolls are awkward with this house and we'll probably order the dolls made for this house. It is a big house, though, and is well suited for and a great model for little girls to play with. It is sturdy and easy to assemble."
5,Versatile Doll House,We've had this doll house for a year now and it still gets played with by my three kids (ages 3 to 6) just as much today as the first day they got it. Some of the doors and walls can be moved around which the kids like. The top windows are removable so that the top floor is easily accessible. The simplicity is the most appealing part of this well-built doll house.
3,Expensive for what it is,"Because I was living in the middle of nowhere, I had no choice but to buy this for a dinner i was making for someones birthday, it did the trick but i found a local organic food shop that is significantly cheaper so I will probably not buy from here again."
1,I AGREE WITH travevectr@aol.com ABOVE!,"I have to agree with travevectr@aol.com. This book was half an afternoon's entertainment for me. I got tired of seeing so many omissions and inaccuracies. The author wonders if Wumpus existed? Hello! What about Oregon trail? How about the entire racing game genre? How about the evolution of shooting games? She likes to repeat the same tired names, Missle Command, Pac-Man, yet neglects huge amounts of games that had wide distribution. Her timeline was incomplete. I guess I should have written this book. A lot of wordsmith, but lacking in substance. The ending is like driving off a cliff. Next thing you know, it's just over. I was looking to see if there was something wrong with my copy, like pages missing.A topic with great potential, mostly unrealized. :("
3,It's like a game you really WANTED to like...,"...but it just irritated you to no end. I must say that Herz's prose is quite unique-- more colorful than Kent's 'The First Quarter' but not anywhere near researched.All I have to say is, Picky, the skateboarding character from Sega's 'Fighting Vipers', is a male character. Herz's use of Picky as an example of a female game character in a chapter focusing on depiction of women in videogames is an unacceptable factual error.There are plenty of female videogame characters she could have used in this chapter-- and not just the usual teen-boy fantasy characters, but strong women characters that actually wear clothes.It's a terrible error-- one that accentuates all the other fact errors in the book.It IS a nice read, being less heavy-handed than most other videogame books. However, its glaring factual inaccuracies hurt the final product."
1,A highly INACCURATE and cursory history book.,"Well, it may be recommended, but only by various reviewers who apparently know as little about video game history as the author of this book. It is an overy affected book obviously designed to impress vocabulary experts. Worse, the book is filled with so many errors, I stopped counting. Its a shame that publishers don't feel that the topic deserves an accurate tome, because it certainly does. Read Game Over by David Sheff instead, there was also an excellent exhibit on the subject that was at the Franklin Institute in Philly, I beleive which can also provide you with an accurate and enjoyable exploration on the topic - or just search the web for ""Video Game History"" to get a more accurate view. Its a shame that a number of people will read this and believe the history presented here, the author sure knows how to get quoted, but she also sure seems not to care enough about her chosen topic to get her facts right. A real shame."
2,Like lots of games I've played...,"...absolute fluff. While Herz is trying to put a spin on the history of gaming, she just about ignores the actualy history behind much of it, instead depending on personal experiences. All this is fine and good, but not particularly meaningful to anyone but herself. Anyone looking for a good book on videogames need look no further than Phoenix: The Rise and Fall of Videogames by Leonard Herman, which is a much more in-depth, detailed looked into the complex world that is videogaming. Now, I realize that's probably not what Joystick Nation had in mind, but I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually enjoy reading this...particularly anyone who plays games in this day and age."
1,What can you expect...,"...from the overeducated, undertalented little chicklet who gave us ""Surfing On [sic] The Internet""? See the SPY magazine article on female Ivy League grads who publish their diaries with the word ""nation"" in the title and an optional cheesecake author photo on the cover.By the way, check the following entry if you're considering Indiana University for yourself or your children..."
3,This would've been better if the reasearch was better,"This could've been a great book. One of those cult things that just goes on for years and years. Instead, this book was dead out of the gate, because even the people that love videogames can't like this book because alot of the information is wrong. Game titles, years, people, etc. Of course not all the information is wrong, but I had wanted to use this book (one of the few on videogames) in a research paper in college and it just wasn't reliable. Too bad, it coulda been a contender(read phoenix instead)... Great title though"
2,Could have been better,I had high hopes for this book but by the time I had reached the last page I was very disappointed. The hard facts are few and far between and many pages are devoted to the author's own interpretations and ideas on why games are popular (a little bit too psychological for my tastes).
2,hyperbolic and factually incorrect,"Initially, Herz's enthusiasm is infectious, but her hyperbole soon becomes tiresome. As does David Sheff in *Game Over*, Herz finds practically every game and piece of software she writes about to be brilliant and exciting, even decidedly B-grade titles like *FX Fighter*. In addition, the book is full of factual errors. These are not restricted to statements about videogames: while her most egregious error is to claim that George Lucas was involved with the *Wing Commander* series, which Herz also suggests is related to *Star Wars*, she also writes that the 1980s pop group A-Ha are Swedish, when they are in fact Norwegian. While Herz manages to make some interesting comments about videogames, she arrives at them by accident, and later chapters degenerate into undirected rambles. The book's lack of a conclusion demonstrates its equal lack of an effective structure and overarching argument."
2,interesting topics but not much critical content,"As a life long gamer who has worked in the video game industry, I was very interested in what this book had to say. While the fluffy sounding titled turned me off at first. The books best features are the chapters on early game history and classic games, while the writing that tries to be stylish but fails miserably, littered with bad pop-culture metaphors and not much content. While I liked her writing on her childhood memories of playing games, the rest of the book it just SOOOOOOOO lame!"
2,Not Worth It...,"Unless you picked it up at a used bookstore. Unfortunately, I paid retail and was less than thrilled at the author's overuse of nostalgia to fill pages. The writing quality lacks structure. Seems a bit too self-referential given the title. Last it is almost patronizing and gratuitous for those who grew up on Atari and Odyssey and tinkered with R/S, Commodore and Timex-Sinclair's.A better pick would be David Sheff's: Game Over. This book is superficial and trite. In fact, I wouldn't miss it from my shelf.Also, author does not answer email."
3,could be better...,"Well, this is more of a memoir than an authoritative history, per se--it's more than a little hit-or-miss in terms of the topics it discusses. Less authoritative than Leonard Herman's Phoenix it may be, but reading it is also significantly less painful--unlike Herman, Herz is actually a decent writer, and the tone is much less leaden. Unfortunately, she also has the tendency to sound faintly supercillious much of the time, which did little to endear her to me. On the whole, this is a relatively entertaining, if flawed, little tome."
4,NO HAGAR BUT GREAT GUITAR FROM MONTROSE AND CREW,"A great album frequently overlooked because Sammy Hagar was no longer in the band. However this album is a good rock album from Montrose and finally available as a domestic print cd. Also now available are WB presents and Open Fire, both great albums."
1,Anecdotal Errors or Deliberate Political Propaganda?,"Mr. Van Der Leeuw's book is incredibly clear in one thing - his enviable ability to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. The worst breech of one's responsibility as a scholar is the inability to record objective reality, a failure that is in itself remarkable in the book. Aside from all the overt signs of successful braiwashing that the author has apparently undergone by his Azeri counterparts, he makes such glaring historical and political errors in the book that even a person with no background in history or political science (such as myself) will immediately pick up on them. The range of errors is almost anecdotal, I have never read a book that makes so many on such few pages. I would recommend that Mr. Van Der Leeuw consults a few relatively objective sources - beginning with a simple Britannica consultation about basic facts in the region and revises the book, unless amusement and harmless ironization is the objective of his writing."
4,Nice clip...could be slightly better,"Nice clip and lanyard ring, however when snapping these on, they have a lot of rotational movement which causes the tip of the clip to wander back and forth. Not a big deal, but the problem is made worse if your end cap doesn't have the best fit like on my Surge (and others I have seen on YouTube). The clip has good tension when mounted and feels pretty secure and matches the overall finish and feel of the surge quite well. In other words, it doesn't seem like a kludgey add-on.Ordinarily you can only use either the clip or the ring in the assigned space, but if you remove the surge ""built in"" lanyard ring, you can snap in the removable one that comes in the kit. That way, you can have both the clip and ring mounted on your surge at the same time. Also, be careful about opening an inside tool with the lanyard ring mounted. As the tool transitions from folded to locked (and vice versa), the lock bar will unlock the ring and it *can* fall out."
2,No very practical accessory,"The pocket clip is nice and will holds the Leatherman firmly in your pocket.But if you are planning to use the Lanyard Ring, think again.It is very large and clumsy.I tried to use it on my Wave with the leather sheath.Since the ring is very big, the sheath can hardly close and it bends the ring.Bottom line, i wouldn't recommend it if you are planning to use the ring."
3,Pocket clip,"I really hav'nt used it yet, I just bought it because I needed to spend 5 more bucks to get super saver shipping!!! I'll let you know when I do..."
5,Part of a birthday gift.,I bought the accessories for the Leatherman tool for my son's birthday. He was very pleased & uses this all the time.
4,Great addition to a great tool.,Super easy to install and stays on quite well haven't had an issue yet. It holds great no issues there. I have it 4 stars because the clip is a little stiff for actual pocket carry (mostly I wear carhartts.) so I carry it in the smaller tool pocket on my right leg and it works great!
4,it's good,I loved it while I used it. Sadly is won't fit in my sheath so I no longer use it. Though when I did it worked great and was very strong and had a good grip on my belt.
3,It is what it is.,"Bought this for my Wave, but I think this piece should have been included with the multi tool. Seems sturdy, but I doubt I'll ever use the lanyard attachment."
3,"Useful, but...","If you then to use the leatherman on its own, the quick release clip and ring are useful and works well. I put mine on a Surge.However, once attached, it doesn't fit into the leather sheath that came with the leatherman. I find it rather troublesome to release the clip/ring everytime I want to keep the leatherman in its sheath."
2,Broke in 2 days,I purchased this to go with my new Surge. At first I was impress with the clip but after wearing it for 2 days it began to stretch out. I tried to bend the metal back and one of the tips that anchors into the leatherman shattered almost instantly while applying slight pressure. I cannot exchange it because what I did is classified as abuse but it should have broken so easily. It still clips into the leatherman but swings loose laterally. I'm glad I didn't throw out my sheath. If you buy this know that it is far from durable.
4,CHEAP ACCESSORIES,If you are buying this for the lanyard Ring for your Wave keep your money as the Wave has a hidden Lanyard Ring built in. I purchased these for the pocket clip but figured I would throw it out there as I had no idea my Wave had a Lanyard Ring. The Pocket Clip and Lanyard Ring attach very easily and are removed very easily. The Pocket Clip needs a bit more retention in your pocket. You could possibly lose your Multi Tool from it slipping out of your pocket. The other problem is that the way it hold the tool in your pocket. If the blade deployed while in your pocket the blade will be pointing straight up waiting for your hand to reach in. Other than that it is a great product.
3,It could be better.,"As far as the lanyard ring goes I'd give that 4 Stars, it's very strong but sticks up a little to high. If I were a climber I'd use this everyday. The clip is definitely a 2 Star piece of equipment. The clips rides too low on the pocket mouth of my side pocket, I wear Carhart Bib overalls. In order to pull the tool from my narrow side pocket I have to squeeze the tool from the bottom and work it up to pull it out of my pocket. I was getting out of my Van and the seat belt caught the bottom of the raised edged of the clip and it snapped off at the top of the clip... bummer.The pocket clip needs a re-work in my opinion especially the top edge so your able to pull it out easily."
4,Leatherman 934850 Quick-Release Pocket Clip and Lanyard Ring,Excellent for pocket tool enthusiasts. Quality product with acceptable price. I recommend it for everyday use ... realy handy and convenient.
2,Very limited usefulnes,"These items are well made, and easy to attach to the tool (although the instructions are not as clear as they might be). However, you have to choose one or the other; why doesn't Leatherman think that people might like to have both available? Also, the lanyard ring doesn't permit use of the belt case, which greatly diminishes its usefulness.I cannot recommend purchasing these items."
3,cant use quick release and lanyard at same time,I got this so my husband could access the tool quickly and with one hand. Problem is you can either use the quick release OR the belt lanyard...not both. So for what I got it for its not so cool.
1,clip faulty,"I received the Leatherman Quick release clip with my Surge for Christmas, and I have been quit disappointed, the clip is quick alright, it kept coming off when I did not want it to, I am waiting for Leatherman's response- not a good accessory."
2,"Good ring, bad clip","I've had my wave for about five years and had a classic Leatherman for about ten before that. I've always loved the leather holsters but recently the snap on the holster for my wave gave up the ghost. Fortunate for me, I thought, that I had bought the lanyard ring and pocket clip set! I like the lanyard ring quite a bit--the quick-release functionality works really well and is superior to the well hidden lanyard ring already on the Wave. After the holster died, I decided to switch to the pocket clip--it's a pocket knife after all. Not three days after switching to the pocket clip (which takes the space of the lanyard ring so they can't be used simultaneously) I sat down, heard a ""Sproing!"" noise and felt the sharp points of my now broken pocket clip digging into my hip. I'll be sure to make use of the fairly generous 25 year warranty on Leatherman products but I don't think I'd recommend anyone buy this unless they just want the quick-release ring."
2,Cool but Dangerous,"I love my Wave and can't seem to go anywhere without it now. When I saw this product I figured it would give me more choices on how to carry it. The cilp is nice if you don't want to mess around with a sheath, buttons on the sheath, or even closing up a tool you're just going to use again in a few seconds. The lanyard is great if you want a quick release that you don't get from the built in lanyard ring. That having been said, the clip can be dangerous. If you follow the instructions for the knife to oil it, the knife blade can become loose enough that it falls partly open with jarring from walking, jumping, etc. There have been a few times that I've almost stapped myself in the gut. I've had less trouble since I removed any trace of oil from the knife, but I still need to be careful. It looks cool, but buyer beware!"
2,Good but temporary,"These clips are terribly useful. They keep my multitool from wandering around in side my pocket, and can be removed in seconds if I want to use a holster instead. Unfortunately, the construction of them is poor. I'm now ordering my 3rd one due to the previous 2 having snapped at the upper bends. This is not from hard use, but one from hitting the floor (dropped from waist height), and the other from bumping into furniture.For usefulness, a happy 5 stars. For durability, a measly 1 star. I'd recommend try 1. If you like/love it, go ahead and buy your 2nd one now!"
3,leatherman wave pocket clip,"Great idea and I carry mine every day but the clip allows the tool to sit below the lip of the pocket you put it in. This makes it difficult to take out of your pocket with one hand. I'm going to try and wrap some 550 cord around the top part of the clip so it doesnt go so deep into the pocket. Overall, I say this is a must-have if you carry a leatherman wave.Clint"
3,included in charge tti,this is included in standard leatherman charge tti. so if you are getting one you do not need this.
2,leatherman ring,"The belt clip is fine and useable but the ring is of no use. I hope I didn't purchase it separately, but now can't find receipt to send it back if it was purchased separately."
2,Get Real About the Size & Weight of Your Leatherman,"Most Leatherman multi-use tools are big and heavy because they're rugged and versatile, and I love my Leathermen. However, this can make them awkward to carry around. Personally, I still prefer a good holster over this product, especially when wearing normal blue jeans and trying to carry a Leatherman on you. Your knife is better protected in one and easier to access. The product itself is made just fine, but I don't think it's very useful."
4,Clip gets in the way a little,"The only complaint I have is that that there is a clip that is always getting caught on things. But I think it can be unscrewed and removed if it becomes very bothersome. The metal isn't as good as some other knives I've had e.g. kershaw, but it is sharp and the edge seems to be holding up ok. I tend to just clip the thing to my belt look with the build in clip/bottle opener. There is no need for any extra sheath or clips so I wouldn't suggest buying the suggested extras unless you really have a specific need for quick release."
4,Uplifting,"This is a mix that is lush, funky and uplifting. It may be called After Hours, but don't play it quietly, as it really comes alive when it's played loud. After Hours 2, also mixed by Jay Chappell, is great too."
5,Amazing Product,I am buying this product for the second time as it makes an amazing gift. Lots of variety for the tea lovers. Received my order very quickly and everything was great.
2,"Terrible teas, pretty box","I am so disappointed in this set. The teas in this box (yes, it's a box, not a chest) are completely flavorless. I would not order this again and urge others not to. Purchase a chest instead and fill with your favorite teas."
1,Tasteless Tea,Poor quality tea with no flavor. The boxes of tea with one dedicated type of taste are great. The tea must go stale in the time it takes for this seller to repackage the tea in the relatively nice kit box.
3,ok,"Inside the package was dusty, I had to clean all the dirt off before I gave it as a gift. Besides that the tea was great"
2,MEH,"These flavors are so bland that you'll need at least 2 of not 3 bags per cup. On a dollar per cup breakdown, it's not worth it."
4,Yummy,The product came on time and tasted good. The tea was not as strong as I hoped but for the price it's good!
1,Don't waste your money!!,"What a joke!! Every single one of these teas taste the same.... like nothing. There are no flavors to them at all. Everything about this item is cheap. You get a BOX, not a chest. Should have known better for the price, but the tea could have at least been a little better. I wouldn't give it any stars at all!!"
2,Please think twice before buying this,I'll explain it very simply: *every tea in this box tastes exactly the same*You are not getting 12 flavors of tea. You are getting one flavor of tea wrapped in 12 different wrappers.Don't let the fancy colored tea wrappers or the tasty flavor names fool you. Lemon Spice tastes just like Ginger tastes just like Tropical Delight tastes just like Apple Cinnamon tastes just like Strawberry tastes just like Herbal Mint tastes just like Cranberry tastes just like Green Tea tastes just like Rasberry tastes just like Earl Grey tastes just like English Breakfast tastes just like Orange Spice **TASTES JUST LIKE NOTHING**Two stars for the overpriced tea box that will store the next teas I buy after I throw away this Ceylon tea.
1,try lipton super fruit teas,its just plain tea nothing special.the tea is weak the bags are cheap.i would say a total waste of money but i actually like the box
2,Tea Chest,"A bit of a disappointment. The cardboard paper leather chest was really just a flat box and underwhelming from the posted description. The selection of individual teas was good, though not for the price, but not something I was proud of to offer as a gift."
2,Misleading,"I agree with some of the other people about the inauthenticity of what's described in the product. The fact that it's labeled ""chest"" when it's actually a box doesn't bother that much. It's actually a nice box. What's really unrepresentative about it is that the picture leads you to believe you'll get different flavored teas. Although the bags may say they are different flavors, they all taste identical."
4,I love the variety,"We were very impressed with the box the teas came in. It was a great way to present a good product. The teas are fantastic. We haven't tried all of them yet, but the ones we have, are very good. We're looking forward to sampling the rest."
1,IT'S A BOX .... not chest!!,"I was very disappointed upon opening the box containing the shipment of this product. I was expecting a nice elegant tea chest ... I guess you get what you pay for, because it definitely did not meet my expectations AT ALL!!Forget the flavors of the tea ... it's all about presentation, and it did not present well enough for my taste. It doesn't even deserve a star; a star would be a completely be over-rating it."
1,Less than I expected,The speaker mic does not match the quality of the other Cobra gear I have. It feels lightly built. It functions but the mic pick up only functions when you basicly eat the mic. With it on your lapel it does not pick up a normal conversation.
4,Makita 110702A = 3 Inch Surface Nozzle,works great for heating up paint dried on runs for home exteriors so you can scrape off and repaint small areas
1,Not as advertised............,Item in the picture shows the eurobar. The one you get does NOT have it.Quality of product is not that great. Steel tubing metal thickness is really thin. It dented using a RUBBER hammer to tap for alignment.Had to drill a third hole in mounting brackets because the two that are there do not hold the guard well no matter how tight the bolts are.Steel plate that holds the lights is really thin. I might have a problem with it flexing when I mount my Hella 4000 lights.I am not happy with this at all and would NOT recommend this to anyone.
1,watered-down dance,"another mainstream dj mix catering to the tastes of the party rather than providing its own flavor. if you enjoy other talentless djs like bad boy bill or richard humpty vission, you're sure to love this. if you appreciate more involved and affective tunes from real djs, like cajmere (we still love you green! ), roy davis jr. or paul johnson, then skip this and every other Webster Hall dancefloor ""hit.""(if i could have given it no stars i would have)"
3,Activites are very good,"This book is typical of people who do not understand the Civil War was not about Slavery. It was made into a war about slavery to keep European countries from recognizing the South. If that would have happened there would be a CSA today. There is a lot of history in this book that is very good, but it has the tendency of beliefs that are not true. The activities in this bood are most excellent and we have done some of them. These are actually as they could have been."
5,"Great, easily comprehensible book for a 5th grader!",My son was home-schooled using a few different texts about the civil war. He found this one to be very informative. Great transaction!
5,My grandson's Civil War book,"I had the book sent directly to my grandson, so I have not seen it, but in one word his opinion was ""Cool!"". That says it all.Carol Janusek"
2,Why is he Top Dog!?!,"This documentary says Marc Jacobs is like the Eminem or Tiger Woods of fashion. I thought his fashions were tacky and unwearable. His undies was always showing when he walked anywhere. Like many documentaries on fashion designers, this never mentions that Jacobs is a rainbow flag man. I wonder if there is bigotry in the industry and what has he done to challenge it. It was nice to see his creative process and what goes on behind the scenes. I mean, if you liked Mizrahi's ""Unzipped,"" then you can enjoy this. Still, I don't understand why any woman would want to be seen with this guy's clothes or purses. Tacky!"
4,Sheath,"My old nylon sheath for a Crescent Toolzall had worn through, so I bought this as a replacement. Performs as it should. Has a sturdy velcro flap that stays closed like its supposed to!"
5,The Moves Make The Man,"The Moves Make The Man is about a young African American boy named Jerome who is sent to an all white school . There he meets an athletic a Caucasian boy named Bix. They become good friends, and they teach each other different things life.I liked this book because it felt like the characters are real. I also liked it because there are some funny parts but there are also some sad parts to. Their friendship helps them through each others hard times. This books theme is basketball but it's mostly about friendship. So I would highly recommend this book.."
3,The Moves Make The Man,I really enjoyed reading the Moves Make the Man.The book is about two kids Jerome and Bix. Bix likes to play baseball and Jerome likes to play basketball. They become really good friends. Bix's mom is in a mental hospital and Bix wants to see her but his dad won't let him.Then Bix asks his dad to play him in a basketball game and says if he wins he could see his mom so Jerome teaches Bix all he knows and Bix becomes good at basketball. Read the book to find out if Bix beats his dad and is able to see his mom.
2,"Had great potential, big upset",Length:: 1:54 MinsThis is me and clare discussing the book The Moves Make the Man by Bruce Brooks
3,Okay,The book was not as pictured and I was looking for that specific edition but it did end up working for the class it was intended for.
2,southwood bookclub,"Last month our bookclub discuss this book, and it was very boring.It most was about other sports not baskekball which was the story. Bruce Brooks write a book that is exciting ."
4,"Great story, but why no quotation marks???","This is a wonderful, thought-provoking story that my 7th graders have enjoyed very much. The relationship between Jerome and Bix is well-drawn and intriguing. The racist language has not been a problem, but the profanity has caused a little concern with some parents. That said, my personal problem with the book--and one that caused some confusion with my students--is the lack of quotation marks to indicate dialogue. The better readers pick up the flow of speech easily, but the slower ones get quite confused at times. I suppose the idea is to recreate the writing style of a young boy, but I tend to see it as somehow saying, ""Look at my style--I'm writing like a young boy."" Otherwise, certainly a book for basketball fans to enjoy."
4,I will play my game under spin light,"I Will Play my Game under Spin LightThe plot of this story begins when Jerome is talking about how great Bix was. He was talking about how Bix ran away and never came back. Then he talks about in the past, how he ran away and why he ran away. Next is when he meets Bix and becomes friends with him and helps him to learn the game of basketball, and to learn that fakes aren't always bad.Liked the book because it was different of how Carl Deuker stated the book in the present and traveled to the past. There was also lots of suspense. Like when Bix was really bad at basketball, you wondered if he would get better or if he would get worse. There was some humor too. Usually it was when Bix and Jerome Joked. There were also some sad parts. One of them was when Bix's mom could hardly remember Bix. Overall It was a great book."
4,Good value for the money,"This radar detector has saved me from getting two speeding tickets so far, which in Massachusetts FAR more than covers the cost of unit! It is a bit too sensitive in Highway mode (lots of false alerts) but does just fine in City mode. I like the verbal announcements, but my first-time passengers find it a bit unnerving to have a third voice in the car."
4,Room for improvement,Overall not bad detector. Get a lot of VG-2 alerts caused when meeting some vehicles which have detectors. Volume too quiet if used in noisy vehicle such as 18-wheeler. I have an extension speaker connected to mine which makes a huge difference to the volume. Had to replace regular jack with the smaller jack in order to connect a CB speaker to it.
5,Edwardian Sterling Filigree Bracelet,Beautiful intricate filigree detailing in a vintage replica bracelet. Craftmanship so intricate that it is difficult to distinguish from my authentic diamond vintage jewelry. Makes a great Art Deco piece.
2,Rebbe Soul,"I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this CD. I first heard Rebbe Soul with the Fringe of Blue CD, which rates much higher in smoothness and likability, and I was hoping for more of the same here, but it was not to be."
4,"My Favorite Andy Sidaris Movie, So Far!","Hard Ticket To Hawaii is a guy movie, through and through. It has action (some of it violent), dumb comedy (much of it very funny), hot women with guns, and T & A. Oh, and it also has a killer snake that jumps out of a toilet, prompting one character to say ""Just when you thought it was safe to take a pee!"". Great!"
4,And I Thought Godzilla Movies Were Funny...,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. Perfect for anyone who enjoys awesomely bad movies. There are airplane pilots with numchucks, a diseased snake, a guy with a bazooka and at one point someone is skateboarding with a blow up doll. The lines in this movie are so terrible that you can't help but laugh. This movie is made by a director that categorizes his scenes with bullets, bombs, and babes. If you ever sit around and watch movies with your friends after a few drinks or just love stupid movies, you've got to have this one."
4,Solid introduction to the region,"This was the first book I read about the region as I prepared to move to Kosovo in late summer 2011. It's a solid primer for recent events in the Balkans, with healthy bit of the deeper history. And it also functions as a tipsheet for interesting travel. I've recommended it to many people here, and those who have read it appreciated the insight into this area. After reading more in-depth about this region, Winchester's treatment can seem a little thin, but that's a necessary sacrifice for covering such a large area from Vienna to Istanbul."
5,The Author did a wondeful job!!,The book itself is wonderful and author does a wonderful job of explaining the years of conflict in the in this particular region of the world.There are times particularly in the introduction when you want the author to shut up and get on with the story. Later on you see how much this one example(in the beginning) kind of weaves all of the points to come together.Overall-Good book if you like history (and good journalism)
3,Sloppy but insightful,"Poor copy editing and, on occasions, unreadably complicated sentences... Much less well written than ""The Professor and the Madman."" Obviously the author and the publisher were in a rush to get the book out before Christmas. The subject is complex, and this justifies (at least in part) the complexity of the sentences. The author does a pretty good job (for a journalist who, by definition, must be superficial). The main point, of the Balkans being torn BETWEEN, and especially BY, Vienna and Constantinople (Istanbul), is a very insightful one and the book is thus worth reading."
1,John Smith,"Don't buy this item for metal roofing. Better job can be done with hand shears vs. Milwaukee 6815, whole lot cheaper as well."
2,Not what I expected at all...,"This book was a relative disappointment to me. I purchased it thinking it would contain a goodly number of images of Boileau's work, and was surprised to find it did not. Out of over 75 pages, there were only 12 illustrations of his work.That being said, it does contain an extensive history of his life, explanations behind some of his more famous images, and a checklist of his work. But I'd save my money if I were you, and not bother trying to special order this one. Pass it by..."
3,Only OK,"I had high expectations for this book, but found it disappointing. Some of the quotes were too esoteric and others lacked the context that would make them understandable. I wish he had included more Woody Allen quotes!"
5,Not what you imagine,"Need a new perspective? Thumb through this delicious collection of quotes. This book is my new I Ching. Close your eyes, pick a page and stumble across another fresh idea. Even if you hate books of quotations you might very well love this one. I did. It's sort of a jump start for your brain. Great present too."
1,Shipping container is a joke!,"I thought maybe the other reviewer just had a bad experience with the shipping of this item, however my order also arrived broken. The box it is shipped in is NOT meant for shipping. Save yourself the hassle and order a different dart cabinet."
1,"Shipping Problems, dont order","I ordered this set and it arrived damaged. They do not ship it in another box, they use the thin box it was packaged in as if you bought it at a store. The replacment came the same way even after discussing with Customer Service. It might be a great tiem but until they fix their shipment for it I would not waste my time!"
1,poor construction,"this product arrived with both doors seperated from body of cabinet. the weight of the doors as compared to the size of the hinges and screws clearly indicates poor design. so i do not think this is a ""damaged in shipping"" issue (althogh the box was a mess also). instead of going thru the hassle of returning the item (i would have needed to rebox and pack), it was easier for me to rebuild the door/body attachments with glue, bigger hinges and longer screws."
1,I plan to sell it on eBay.,"I don't like this One Touch electrolysis thing. It makes annoying noises, it irritates the skin, it takes forever, it's not painless as claimed on various sites where I read about it, and another false statement is the ""self adjusting stylet tip can't ever pierce skin."" I plan to get rid of it on eBay."
1,Sterling Silver Band,I returned this ring the very next day after receiving it. It did not look like the picture when I opened the package. It was disappointing because I was looking forward to wearing this on an everyday basis. Don't waste your time with this item!!!!
5,OoooooooOOOOoooh WEE!,"I've been waiting on this album to drop for months... These mufuccas are so fuccin tight. I finally got the CD last night... it's off the H double-O K. The Rick rock beats are all slumpers & the lyrics are raw. STRAIGHT OUTTA FAIRFIELD, CA, BAY AREA!!! Don't download it... buy it, so these fools can put out another one. OOOOOOOOooooh WEEEeeeeee!!! Representing Sacramento."
2,Boring and unconvincing,"I kept falling asleep reading this and finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through. I did reasonably like the earlier books in the series, but not this one. I think much of the problem was that the character's motivations seemed so unconvincing that I just could not find myself caring. They would take the most mundane of problems, like putting on a Christmas skit, play them up as of earth-shattering importance, and propose ridiculous ways of solving them, which then tended to have lots of complications. I suppose in some sense this was supposed to all be humorous, but instead, it just kept making me forget why I was supposed to care."
5,Memphis: The Original Broadway Production,"Very nice souvenir. We saw this musical in New York, liked it very much and for a long time we could not buy a video!Now we are happy with this video!"
5,Super Great,"Book, music, and cast are exceptional. The lithe and lovely Montego Glover is funny, sensitive, soulful, immensely talented, Chad Kimball is absolutely extraordinary, a character actor in a classic romantic role, endlessly inventive, all heart, a great soul. My favorite musical of all time."
2,The Lead is the problem...,"I too couldn't stand the lead when PBS broadcast this performance. His nasal whine was unlike any voice I have known...from Hattiesburg to Mobile, from New Orleans to Charleston...and I couldn't watch past the first act. Can we hope for a new disc with Adam Pascal currently performing on Broadway? Everything he touches is GOLD..and he had great reviews."
2,Great production - lousy lead,"This musical won Best Musical. Its a good production and a very good DVD with great sound and sharp picture. I really wanted to like this. But the subject matter was handled so much better and with humor in Hairspray. The songs are decent but unmemorable. But the REAL problem is the male lead who insists on talking like Deputy Dawg or James Cagney. I never got used to it. It is so incredibly annoying that you simply cannot buy the bi-racial relationship he gets into with a woman who offers so much, while he offers nothing but obnoxious exuberance and annoyance. If the lead actor were to cut out his speaking pauses while speaking his lines, the show would easily be a half-hour shorter--and sweeter. I love broadway musicals of all kinds but this guy does for Broadway what Jar Jar Binks did for the Star Wars Franchise."
1,DVD was damaged upon receipt,"I have seen this play live and thoroughly enjoyed it so I wanted my father to see it. I bought for him for his birthday however, when he removed the shrink wrap and opened up the cartridge the DVD was cracked. Needless to say he was not able to view the show."
5,SUBTITLES,I would like to know what is the languages of the subtitles from Memphis'blu-ray.Thank'sMemphis: The Original Broadway Production [Blu-ray]
5,Great musical!,The performers in this show are amazing! And the music is wonderful! I'm so glad they made this available on DVD so I can watch it over and over and over and... :)
2,Unimpressive,"Average toy, overly priced. I ordered this item for a birthday gift. Frankly I was embarrassed to give it. It was SO meager, not at all what I had expected from the ad. I wasted my money"
5,My Christmas toy,"My Grandfather gave me the Magz X 160 construction set as a Christmas present, and I love it. It's so cool to play with."
4,OH MY GOODNESS!,"What can a say? These are the best for little and big minds that like to build and construct things. My 5 year old never has enough of these. If you have dogs, cats and little ones be careful if these get left laying around. They are tiny and can be swallowed very quickly."
3,Magz-X,"In comparison with GeoMag or Magnetix, Magz have by far the weakest magnets, and the material quality is inferior as well. Don't get me wrong, these may be fun, but your money would be better spent on one of the other products. They have a different scale as well. I won't return them, I would like to end up owning some of each of them to find out just which ones are best. To this point GeoMag are the strongest, but the difference between them and Magnetix are not enough to worry about, but Magz may not even have half the magnet strength as the other two. If you want one of each brand, give this a try, if you are looking for a great product, GeoMag or Magnetix will be a better purchase.Edit:GeoMag rods will hold up to 6 consecutive steel ballsMagnetix will hold up to 4 consecutive steel ballsMagz will hold 3 consecutive steel balls"
4,My kid loved this Magnetic toy,"I seems to be a nice toy, and my kid agreed. He loved playing with it. Really nice to create 2D and 3D figures just joining magnetic pieces (X-s, bars and balls). Be careful with small kids (under 3) because they can eat them."
5,Fun Times,"Bought this for a 9 year old boy, absolutely loves it. Fun toy, well worth it. He will go back and play with it, not just a toy for a month, something that is used for a long time."
5,Wedding Words Sugar Sticks,"I ordered these as part of the favor at my sister's shower, which was a tea party theme. The feedback from our guests was very positive."
2,"a must ""not"" see!!!","I own about 25 wwf videos and this is probably the worst I've ever seen. Most of the matches are as boring as the classic saturday morning ""wwf superstars"" from the 80's. Beniot vs Angle was great but most are one sided and predictable. The main event has to be the biggst letdown of them all with HHH being in prime form but having the typical match with the rock, shane is also a contender but you wouldn't know it the way he stands around collecting dust. McManhon offends and gets his typically, if I were you I'd go get some real sports entertainment like king of the ring 98, survivor series best of, fully loaded 2000, and even wcw halloween havoc 98 or 99, but not this hunk of plastic."
2,No More UK Event,"Triple Threat WWF Championship Match: The Rock (Champion) vs. Triple H vs. Shane McMahon WWF European Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Edge and Christian (Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz WWF Hardcore Championship Match: 1.

Arm Wrestling Match: The Kat vs. Terri 7. Rikishi and ""Showkishi"" vs. The Dudley Boyz You would think this card was cool. But [no]. Don't buy this or any UK event!"
5,Absolutely great writing!,"Janette Oke does a wonderful job at capturing the life of Joshua Jones in these four books. I love the setting in middle America, and seeing a slice of history worked into the growth of Josh from a boy to man. This will make you laugh and cry, so make a cup of tea and enjoy!"
5,For young and old,My gradmaw read me these books evey night when i was about 6 I laughed i cried so much raw human emotion Im 16 and reading them again It takes skill to have a good clean family oreanted story love these books!
3,Not her best,"After reading the Love Comes Softly Series and the Prairie Legacy, I couldn't wait to read another series by Ms. Oke. I was excited to get Seasons of the Heart in one volume. I just couldn't get into this volume though. I tried several times and just could not finish it. I have actually had the book for several years now, probably around five. Maybe one of these days. I even loaned it to a friend and she couldn't get into it either. Obviously, lots of folks do like it. So don't let me discourage anyone from reading it."
4,A question for those who have bought The new Sony DVD,"For those of you who have purchased the new Sony edition of this DVD, and watched both the main & supplemental material, myself & many others who own the older MCA DVD of this program want to know: Does the Sony edition differ in any way from the MCA edition(new audio mixes, additional video content etc.) ????"
1,Band of Gypsies DVD,"I am a professional guitarist and huge Hendrix fan. This DVD is terrible! They are always cutting away from the live footage to some person (Vernon Reid, Slash, etc) talking about Hendrix. . There is not one complete performance without cutaways. It is very frustrating. They even cut away during the solo of ""Machine Gun"", one of the awesome solos of all time. This DVD is a waste of money. There should be a DVD with just live Hendrix music... no talking."
3,Mostly documentary,I thought there would be more music but mostly people blabbing about how great and significant Jimi was (like we don't know that already).The few minutes of actual (poor quality) footage is still worth it (to me).
2,Disappointed,"I wanted a full Live DVD of the Band of Gypsies, so this was quite disappointing.Should have read the details before I purchased, but I suppose my husband is happy for his birthday gift."
1,Sooooo Disappointing,"After waiting months for the release, a gathering of friends sat before the large screen, stereo cranked, fired up and ready. It was all down hill from there.Interrupting Jimmy was bad enough, but the racist doing the interrupting have Jimmy crying in Heaven. So awful, I trashed it. They interrupted CHANGES!!!!!How sick is that?"
3,This is NOT the concert video,"This is NOT the concert video. This is the same documentary ABOUT the Band of Gypsies as the 1970 one. anyways maybe the video is in better quality but it's ""NOT THE WHOLE"" Band of Gypsys concert as a pure straight concert. This still is a good documentary about the Band of Gypsies, but not the concert video everyone has been hoping for after these years upon years."
3,Band of Gypsies DVD,"Only part-way through the DVD, but must tell you that this is NOT the concert video I was expecting. There is quite a bit of amazing footage of the shows, some even in focus, and some in which you can even see Jimi's hands, but this is largely a documentary ABOUT the Band of Gypsies, heavily edited and voiced-over. I'll get back to you after I've watched the whole thing."
4,top stuff,"I've had Band of Gypsies on cassette since I was a schoolboy 20 years ago. I played it non stop in every car I owned, until they stopped making cars with cassette decks - then I had to get the CD. To this day if you get in my car, you're listening to Band of Gypsies. End of story.Finally decided to buy this DVD and I'm glad I did. The documentary is really interesting, I'm ashamed to admit I never knew there was so much back story to the Band of Gypsies. As pointed out in other posts, there is full concert footage in the extras so no one's ripping us off.The combination with Buddy Miles gave Jimi a totally different sound to anything else he ever did, and the innate understanding between Billy Cox and Jimi is always a pleasure to observe. It will always be my favourite Hendrix performance, and I'm grateful to this DVD for giving me a better understanding of the history around it.Could have done without comments from Slash, but I dunno I guess they decided they needed a white guy?"
4,Jimi- Live,Worth the money. Great addition to any rock DVD collection. Has some good songs form the era and it's great to watch!
4,Good Jimi stuff,"It is tough to find good stuff on Jimi seeing that he was before the time of video cameras being everywhere, and the quality of some things is not very good. I liked this DVD. The footage of the Band of Gypsy's concert is not high quality, and it is black & white, but it is a historic moment captured by the film camera. There are some songs that didn't make it on the concert album. The sound quality is very good. If you collect all things Jimi, or are just looking for something you have never seen before, you should get this. It is worth the price."
1,Only Goebbels could write a book like this!!,"What someone can say!!! As it is known,in 1998, 12 newly Soviet documents was released, which prove the fabrication of the biological warefare (see: Bulletin Bulletin 11 - Cold War Flashpoints, CWIHP by Milton Leitenberg ). Endicott could simply ask for forgivness from Korean war veterans. But no, he insists and accuses the community of historians that the documents are a fabrication of Beria against his rivals inside the CPSU!!!!!In Ancient Greece the worst crime was to commit a slander (Sycophantia - sycophant).Endicott is lucky that he is not live in Ancient Greece[...]"
4,Cutting Board,"Excellent cutting board for resisting cuts and scratches. It is light weight but still doesn't move because of the friction buttons on the bottom. These buttons create a space beneath the board, permitting a slight deflection when making heavy cuts, the only minimal fault"
5,Most helpful volume for those who wish to create a formal garden,"I have searched for several years for book(s) that provide advice on how to create a formal garden. Astonishingly, I found none that offer much practical advice beyond pretty pictures and the usual design principles found in most design books. That is to say, I found none until I happened upon this book. It made me feel good to have the author explain that when he began his own formal garden, in the mid 70's he found no practical books either!The volume is full of illustrations showing different examples of key formal design elements, It offers good advice on how to create shaped hedges and screen, topiary, and how long it takes for them to shape up. Small things like how to cut a hedge perfectly straight or flat is also explained. Lists of appropriate plants are included.Highly recommended. This book should be in print."
5,A Young Tenor's Tribute to his Homeland,"A vibrant and touching journey through American music, from the Old American Songs of Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber's Sure on this Shining Night and Simple Song from Leonard Bernstein's Mass, through crossover Broadway tunes such as I Gotta Get back to New York and Putting on the Ritz, to heart-stoppingly patriotic hymns such as America the Beautiful and Battle Hymn of the Republic.Buy it now!!!"
3,apple computer,The computer came as expected and worked great except the CD player did not function. This really was not a stumbling block as I had a spare. It solved my immediate problem. It also was a 733MHz machine with the 1.4.06 OS Tiger installed and 512MB of RAM which was more than the Amazon advertisement said it was but the seller's advertisement had it correct.
2,Functional but not durable,I second the disposable answering machine description. It worked perfectly for two years; now it is dead. I had no problem with the remote call function and thought it was a great value. Annoying things: it has no speakerphone function and you can't skip listening to any messages-- you have to listen to all of them. Don't buy this as a long-term appliance.
3,Longest troublefree operation of any machine I've had,"Like almost everyone, I've had a dozen answering machines because they just didn't operate long, or didn't do what was needed. This little machine does its job day after day, even cooperating with a fax machine perfectly (unless I gum up the works by trying to answer from an extension!). My only complaint about it is the short and unpredictable message it will record for incoming calls and the microscopic time allowed for the outgoing message! You just have to be fast and concise on the Conair!"
2,It will do if you are not Desperate for all your messages,"I've had the machine about a month. I thoroughly read the instructions and have found that the remote call in does not work--for me. I call form work and the machine won't. Further, after the machine is full, it stops working. The Save/Stop feature is the SAME button. So, you may not want to save a message, but you still have to push that button. I guess, since it seizes up after 10 messages, it doesn't matter if you saved it or not. You have to erase all to help it to start again."
1,You Get What You Pay For...,"In this case, I got this free then downloaded the manual from ConairPhone.com. This unit is cheap in both price and quality. It lacks some basic features which other ""cheap"" models have such as: date/time stamp, selective erase feature, skip a message, save a specific message. This unit, as mentioned previously, ALWAYS requires the user to listen through all messages to get to the most recent. That's if the user has remembered to save them. If the user forgets to press the ""stop/save"" message button after listening to them, the next call will force erasure of ALL saved messages. No chance of retrieval. I tried the remote operation with my cell phone and was unable to activate the unit, since my phone will not play the tones long enough. This is a BASIC unit. Don't get it if you want a few features; this one can be a source of frustration."
1,Total POS,"My mother bought this unit for my elderly aunt for her new apartment. Not only is the unit non-intuitive and feature poor (even for a 72- year-old schoolteacher), but it refused to work once the power was restored after Hurricane Isabel. I suspect that it could not handle even the most minor voltage surge when the power came back on. The unit was so new the box was still sitting on her kitchen table (luckily). I'm going to shop for an inexpensive unit from a manufacturer with a proven track record of reliable phone products (Panasonic - loved everthing I've ever owned of theirs)."
1,Missing product,"I still haven't received my product, Ive tried reaching seller but they don't reply. It's been about ten day passed the arriving date that they gave me."
2,Static on line,"I purchased the white version of this phone when it was on sale for $15.00 at amazon.com and the reviews were good. Unfortunately the phone has static on it when in use. Changing the channel or anything else doesn't help. I guess I'll have to send it back because it is basically unusable. None of the other reviews had mentioned this problem, so maybe it is a manufacturing defect rather than a design problem."
5,1970s illustrated survival guide for simple communal living,"This book is illustrated by the author in simple line drawings. She draws knowledge about communal hippie living from many individuals and acknowledges them in her book. They give specific directions on how to build your own shelter, dig a proper latrine, grow your own food, sew your own clothing, and live harmoniously on the earth with your fellow humans. These lessons taught by Alicia Bay Laurel and her friends should become part of our American oral tradition. People of all generations can benefit from the author's childlike perspective on simplicity."
5,Amazing!,"This is one of the best books EVER written. It has helped me to survive and thrive on this Earth and gives me advice on practically anything I need to know! Perfect for those who need to settle down and be more in tune with their bodies and Mother Nature. Alicia Bay Laurel is an amazing artist, activist, and author that I look up to much indeed."
5,"Touching and beautiful, this is one of France's best films.","This movie touches on everything: family relationships, work, friendship, loss, renewal, and hope. ""Le huitième jour"" takes on a story line which could be trite, but will quickly surprise you! I first saw it in a theater in Bordeaux and it instantly became my favorite of the year. I have since shown in to family and students in my French classes. The French is much easier to understand for upper-level students than are many other French films. Its beauty lies in its universal portrayal of human relationships, as well as in its beautiful colors and creativity. If you see one foreign movie this year, see ""Le huitième jour."""
5,The Eighth Day (VHS) aka Le Huitieme Jour,"This particular film is one of the most rare and difficult to come by and I had just about given up hope that I would ever own a copy of it. This company continues to make available the foreign films that are difficult to acquire. The quality of the video is excellent, the ordering process so simple and expedient, and the delivery time amazingly fast through amazon.com. Again, on behalf of my French students and myself I would like to express my gratitude for the fine selection of foreign films they make available for purchase. They truly deserve the highest rating possible. I encourage others to take advantage of the extensive film selection this company has to offer while the films are still available to us. This is a VHS film you will also want to own so you should place your order right away."
2,LOW BUDGET,"I like low budget movies, but this was just bad. I had high hopes for it though. It starred Ray Park(Darth Maul). Just didn't go very well."
1,BAD !!!,This is a very bad low budget action movie . The acters are awful - the fight scenes are laughable - this is one of the worst action movies I have seen so far this year .
1,Piece of $#!+ waste of time,"Ray Park is one of the most talented martial artists in movies today and guess what?.......he doesn't do anything but fire pistols in this horrible crap pile of a movie. Zero plot, horrible acting, putrid choreography and awful production values. There is nothing even remotely redeeming about this waste of money. If you have a brain you will avoid this at all costs."
4,action!,action and more action!! a mercenary on a mission to terminate the devil himself!*sponsored post
4,Anvil - 'Plugged In Permanent' (Metal Blade),"'Plugged...' is only like the second,maybe third title of Avnil's catalog I've ever had.This is the Canadian band's 9th album as I didn't realize they've been at it since 1981.Best described as 'aggressive thrash metal'.Tracks that make this disc a keeper are ""Racial Hostility"",the ass-kicking ""Destined For Doom""(possibly the CD's best cut),""Face Pull"" and ""Five Knuckle Shuffle"".Line-up is Steve 'Lips' Kudlow-guitar&vocals,Ivan Hurd-guitar,Glen Five-bass and Robb Reiner-drums.Should appeal to fans of Slayer,Exodus,Metal Church and Forbidden."
4,A fantastic 80's style thrash album in the 90's.,"If you like 80's thrash,m and dont like the newer cookie monster vocals of modern metal, then you might like this. fun to listen to and to headbang. I gave myself a little whiplash listening to it, and have been for 12 years now too."
3,past glory,"For a really great speed metal album try to get Anvil's ""METAL ON METAL"". THAT is the real classic.I swear it to you. I would not lie."
1,Waste of money,"Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to read the reviews for this DVD before I purchased it. Had I read the reviews I would have thought twice before buying it. Well, needless to say, I am totally disappointed. Sub-par video quality and sound for one. Secondly, it is just a compilation of footage from Live Without a Net and Right Here, Right Now. Do yourself a favor and purchase them instead. Waste of money!"
1,Disappointed,Do not purchase If you already own Live without a net or Right here right now.This is not an authentic dvd or it would be on Van Halen website.
3,Red spira naval ring,"I have a problem where I can only use a certain kind of metal for my belly ring like a certain kind of steel or where my piercing is gets all red, and this did not do that at all it was fine, no redness it did not irriate my belly at all, but if I had my pants up too high or when I was sitting, it pressed into my skin and was very uncomfortable, and after about a day of having it in I had to take it out because it began to pain. So it is good for like a one day thing, but you can't leave it in to long."
4,A great collection of Abbott and Costello comedy,"This album which runs about 77 minutes includes 6 sketches by Bud Abbott and Lou Costello mostly from their run on radio. ""Flee-Flu"" includes an appearance by Peter Lorre as head of a sanatarium. ""Laugh, Laugh, Laugh"" is an enjoyable combination of music and jokes. And, of course, there's the full 7 minute version of ""Who's on First?"" which is A and C's best known routine. A very enjoyable set of comedy pieces culled from radio that is only slightly marred by imperfections in the quality of the original recordings (especially during ""Who's on First?""). However, in my opinion, this does not appreciably detract from the enjoyment you will have listening to these comedy sketches for the first time or for the 1000th time."
5,"Templaco 4-7/8"" strike template",The template did exactly what it is supposed to do. It sits there and leaves a hole to create a strike prep.
5,Prefect book,There was not any info on this book but for the price I took a chance. It was perfect. it was a christmas gift for my brother who is spending the next 3 years in Singapore and he really likeed it.
4,A fun read!,I've long been a fan of Frasier. So I thought this would be a fun book to thumb through. If you really know your Frasier episodes you'll enjoy the little differences... such as the written script differing from what is actually said in an episode. It gives you an appreciation for the actors/actresses on how they tune the dialog to give the show its unified sense of humor and personality.
5,The Definitive Work,"Jean-Noel Bassior has written the definitive work on Space Patrol. The book interweaves first-hand interviews, archival information, and great images into an unbeatable treatment of the subject. From the first few pages, the reader understands Bassior's direct connection to the material. Meeting Lyn Osborn (Cadet Happy) at age 9 left an indelible mark on Bassior who then spent many years thinking about and ultimately fashioning this great book."
4,Beer Tour Envy!,"This documentary was a great watch for the aspiring homebrewer/microbrewer. It is not a how-to video, nor a complete tour video, but it is a nice view of some of the small American breweries.We all know the big boys of brewing, now watch this to see the faces and stories behind the little guys who are out to have fun! Overall a good documentary. It does jump around a bit, but overall it left me wanting to see the entire footage they shot.I would recommend this video!!"
2,"looks good, only better if it works!","I bought it given reviews by others, but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it hasn't worked ever since. I'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works!"
1,Bell SpinFit Calorie Bike Speedometer,received 2 Bell SpinFit Calorie Bike Speedometer. Batterys are bad. I bought a battery and one speedometer worked part of the time. I rode 10 miles and the odomoter recored 6.2 working intermittenly
1,Bell makes a lousy product,"I found this bike computer was easy to install and get to work, but after about 100 miles, this speedometer just failed completely. The magnet on the front wheel which is used to contact the ""counter beacon"" exhibits varied sensitivity resulting in inaccurate speed and distance readings. For example, my speed often jumped from an accurate 6 mph to 199 mph because the beacon slips and the magnetic signal is poor. The computer also reset the odometer when i took it off of the stage, losing all of my miles. The electrical contacts somehow got dislodged and the computer no longer functions at all. What a waste of money.i am surprised to see anybody giving this product any stars given that this speedometer failed so quickly and in so many different ways. I have purchased a more expensive replacement from Schwinn and strongly recommend against the purchase of this Bell product."
5,Great Item!,"I love this item! Works great, easy install, just wish it would have A back light. Thanks bell."
4,"Good, Make sure it is cliped in","This product is a descent one. I bit difficult to install but do-able in 15 min. Completely waterproof. Fell into a puddle because it wasn't clipped in right and came out just fine. Make sure to clip it in and pull on it, to make sure it is secured, or it might fall off. (like mine did). Also it only has 1 trip meater.(-)"
1,Not worth the money!,"I tried this because it seemed like a few people managed to get it to work. And since I didn't want to spend a lot on one, I thought I would give it a go. NO. I wouldn't even waist your time and money! I have tried to get it to work. Its a great clock for when you are out and about, but I can not get it to do anything else. Plus, the instructions are a little difficult, as they are small and can be hard to identify what end of what goes where."
3,Wheee!,"Look how fast I'm going, Ma! Keeps track of your mileage, too. I don't recommend trusting the calorie counter feature (on this or any other calculator - too many variables!)"
4,A good product but....,"This is a fine product. It does what it promises. I have aways trusted Leviton products, so when I was looking for a tabletop dimmer this brand stood out. We wanted a dimmer for the lamp in our nursery, which has a 3-way bulb. The other review on this dimmer says that they use it with a 3-way bulb, but the directions packaged with this dimmer specifically tell you NOT to use it with a 3-way bulb. Ugh. I wish that had been in the product description. I guess I will rewire the lamp now."
4,"Perfect, except you must use incandescent bulbs","This was exactly what I wanted. The light dims to a near glow and has a nice gradual gliding switch that goes up to bright light. The big drawback is that you have to use an incandescent bulb, otherwise you don't get a good dim (only goes to what I call ""less bright""), the transitions are jumpy from less bright to bright and the bulb hums. All of those problems go away with a traditional bulb. The tabletop control has a nice firm grip on the nightstand but doesn't stick or damage the table top. The cord is a good length and the green light that comes on when the switch is off is not obnoxious but is bright enough to help you find the light in the dark. I've been using this light daily for about a month and would highly recommend it."
4,Nice product for the money,"Nice product for the money. Easy to install, easy to work and not bad looking either. Nice company to do business with also."
5,works great,"I bought this foe a touch lamp with no switch that didn't work. This lets me turn that lamp on and off , and the dimmer works fine too. Very easy to reach."
1,A disappointment,"This book offers nothing new or striking on Elvis or his times. The story is more about Orson, an Elvis fan and socialist. Character development is disappointing, and the story line is implausible, particularly for this reader who has some familiarity with Elvis history. There are too many coincidences that conveniently appear when needed to move the story along. There are also annoying inconsistencies with reality, indicating a lack of homework. Important ""real-life"" characters are not accurately portrayed. Some are given short shrift or not mentioned. I really expected much more from Mr. Buckley."
1,Elvis In The Morning,"Elvis in the Morning is a chronicle, sort of a Reader's Digest condensed version of Elvis' life from 1958 on with large, large chunks left out. It adds the fictional friend, Orson Killare who, after meeting Elvis in Germany and introducing him to Priscilla, becomes his telephone buddy. He only meets Elvis a few times, on one occasion he advises him to stop making bad movies and get back to performing for his fans. Soon after, Elvis does the TV special. Orson becomes a silicon valley genius and a cocaine addict, kicks the habit and this sets him up to be the person Colonel picks to try to get Elvis into recovery. It doesn't work and Elvis dies.On the positive side, the book is factually accurate, particularly in the understanding of Elvis' addiction. It doesn't glamorize cries for attention such as giving away Cadillacs.It is a book which didn't need to be written, it shed no new light on the well known Elvis story."
2,Weak writing from Buckley,"Since I was surprised to read such weak writing from such an experienced and knowledgeable author as William F. Buckley, I was even more surprised to read so many positive reviews at Amazon.com. Where am I missing the boat? Yes, it was rather clever of Buckley to follow Elvis's life from the unique perspective of Priscilla's childhood friend, Orson ""Killer"" Killare. But the facts of Orson's life were so contrived to relate to events of that era in a Forest-Gump-like copy cat fashion and so briefly and rotely dictated, that his character development was extremely weak leaving me feeling no attachment whatsoever to his character. Would I recommend this book to a friend?- -only if he/she was an avid Elvis fan like myself who might enjoy this unusual attempt at revealing the historical background surrounding Elvis's tragic life. I would certainly never recommend it as an example of good writing."
5,Excellent book for visually oriented learners,My son opened the book and said the alphabet then started to sound out the words on the next page. He has just turned six and we have been working on his alphabet and the sounds of letters. This book is helping him put together what he knows to make him a reader! He is very motivated and proud of himself. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to help their child learn to read especially if the child is a visual type learner.
3,Depends on your style,"I bought Alpha-phonics with the hope that it would be a simple way to teach my five year old how to read. She thinks it is boring. I now use it as a tool. I use the words from each lesson to create my own games and activities. We've made our own books using the words from the lessons, created word sorts, played matching games with rhyming words, etc. My daughter has learned a lot but it is because I've made the lessons more hands on. I believe in a balanced literacy program when it comes to reading. The learner needs to see the words in text too. In summary, Alpha-phonics is a great tool but my daughter needs more then what it offered."
1,Don't Go Kindle For This,"This book and method looks to be a great tool to start with my 3 (soon to be 4yr.) old. Just don't go with the Kindle version, because you will not receive the lessons with it."
2,Kindle Version review,"I recently purchased this title in the Kindle format. Unfortunately, this format does not contain the actual phonics lessons as far as I could tell. Rather, it contains instructions for what the teacher is supposed to do for each lesson. I ended up returning the ebook. That said, when and if the corrected version becomes available, I intend to purchase it."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,Be careful with this very cheap plastic attachments DO NOT attach well lose and wiggle around??? My son was NOT pleased with this. Does not shot far and BB's shot out then up in the air UPWARDS??Terrible
2,It was just Meh.,"The gun had a cool paint job and looked and feelt great and it came with all of the rail attachments that i was hopping it would come with and the battery was alright, i had no problems using it 2 and a half hours. But, When i got to use it in its first war it was all for show because 200 FPS is weak and so the range was short as well. On top of that the rifle was very inaccurate. In conclusion, it is a good beginers gun if you do not have any big expectaions because it struggled to compeat with the pistols I used it the war and i found my self just using my pistol becuause this rifle is so unreliable. In short you get what you pay for (i got it for $35)."
3,WEAK not for wars,This guns will not go into a can very weak and not accurate can barely go 10 feet with the bbs curving sharply upward even with hop up down if this is your first AEG(auto electric gun) then it is good but don't use it in any war excerpt maybe backyard wars.
2,i strongly dislike it,"ok its a good gun im not going to lie but the camouflage just ruins it if it were fully black with the orange tip it would be fine but no it had to have the camouflage. LImited edition yeah right you could get the exact same one everyday at the swap maeet or flee market if you will. Simply do not buy this gun,buy this gunNew Generation MP5A5 Heavy Airsoft Gun Full Size MP5A5 LOADEDthat will be a good use of your money"
1,"as if the album could get any worse: voila, the censored version","This is an atrocious stain on modern music. The singer is talentless, anyone with operative ears can tell that. He sounds like a girl yet isn't. Just like New Found Glory and Rush, a bad singer ruins the band. In this case, however, everything that could go wrong has; a different singer would not fix anything. The guitar progressions are entirely lame. Don't waste your time on this piece of trash, or the unedited version for that matter. Terrible, terrible band."
4,A higher place in my heart.,"I remember when I first saw this LP. I was back ago in 1988, I guess. After all this time, this album has remained in my memory as one of my weirdest and most strange memories. This album has very basic ""spanish"" lyrics when we listen to it for the first time. But this apparently ""funny and disposable"" album by ""Los Toreros Muertos"" is a great compound of awesome played instruments, incredible mind blowing scenes and ""read between the lines"" lyrics. This is not your 5 stars favorite album, but I highly recomend this one to those dreamers who always will keep a part of their childhood with them. And if you want to be a kid again but want to apply your adult thinking for about 30 min, buy this one. I'm also looking for ""Mundo Caracol"" a hard-to-find recording by this band."
3,VERY GOOD ALBUM@,"SI QUIERES TENER 2 DE LOS MEJORES CLASSICOS DE LA HISTORIA DEL ROCK EN ESPAñOL. YO NO ME LLAMO JAVIER,MI AGUITA AMARILLA LLEVATE ESTA MADRE ESTA DE PELOS."
1,Disappointed,"Buyer beware. I recieved plain DeWalt 12v flashlight bulbs which are not as good as the Porter Cable Xenon bulbs (I have used both brands and the DeWalt is not as good) for the same price. Shipping and handling was also 5.99, the USPS envelope had a .76 stamp on it, seems like a lot extra just to stick something in an envelope."
4,"Awesome, but bulbs break after one fall","Great flashlight. I use it all the time. My kids also love it and have broken the bulb once. So did my brother-in-law. One fall is all it takes. This is the only bad thing about the flash light. Oh yeh, these bulbs are impossible to find locally, so do like I did and order a bundle..."
4,super bright,These are extremely bright bulbs. I have no idea how long of a life they have though because they don't survive a fall when hot in the model 869 flashlight. Aimed at the celing from floor this bulb provides enough light to see clearly what you are doing in a 10' X 10' room with no problem.
4,Not for the commercialized fan..,"This cd is not for fans who listen to Crystal Method on the radio! It is for the fans who go to raves and are into the electronic scene. I for one am quite happy with this cd, since there are no other dj's that I have found that capture this style. I have seen them live twice, once playing a dj set, the other their own music and this cd comes quite close to a real dj set show. Hell they even played red pill at the show I was at. Anyways if you are into the scene and like breakbeats, drum & bass etc... you will absolutely love this album, which I do. The reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they did a much better job live, in-terms of song selection and overall feel. This album is a teaser to the real thing, it wets the appetite but never really draws you in fully, something that they are more than capable of. So the moral of the story is: GO SEE THEM LIVE!"
3,Repsond,"I just don't like this kind of techno. I don't like mix albums...so thats why I chose to voice my opinion....after all...thats what this is for, isn't it?"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"The reason I purchased this album was the mix of ""Wild, Sweet & Cool"". Which in retrospect was a mistake. That song is the only song on the album which reminds me that this a Crystal Method CD. I liked Vegas & Tweakend but they are not ""Dance Mix CD's"". This album is pretty much only a dance mix, very repetitive and boring unless you are actually dancing."
3,A good album worthy of the cost of the CD,"I like it. I like most of the tracks they remix to begin with. Yes, it's worth the cost of the CD. No, it's not as good as Vegas (but could they really top that?). If you have Vegas and like it, this is a nice compliment. If you don't have Vegas, get that first and come back to this if you need a little more fix of The Crystal Method. You'll probably be back for this one."
1,Not like C.M. at all really,"This is not on nearly the same calaber as albums like Las Vegas, so don't expect it to rock out one's mind as such. I even ended up throwing my copy in the trash as useless!"
3,Not bad for a mix album,"First of all, if you buy this CD and expect another Vegas or Tweekend, you will be disappointed. What you will find here is a continuous mix of songs mixed by TCM. More breakbeat-oriented than any other TCM work, I found Community Service to be a bit repetitive, but it certainly has its share of enjoyable tracks. Breakin' on the Streets, Name of the Game, Boom, Renegades of Funk, and Paranoid were my favorites.This CD is definitely not for everyone. If you are a big TCM fan, I would recommend this CD, or if you are simply a big electronic music enthusiast."
4,Dog's best friend,"I would also give this toy a 5 from the dog's perspective but a 3 for durability. It is best for short periods of supervised play. Our dog would stare at it and beg us to get her ""friend"" down to play. It was when left alone too long that she was able to tear the seams.Here I am ordering a second one, though, because all of us had so much fun with it! Also a great conversation piece, always entertaining."
5,Yippee yo yippee yay,This is my dog's favorite toy also. It's very well made and has outlasted several other squeak toys that we'd gotten around the same time. I love the fierce expression on the pup's face.
5,An amazing way to get started,I really enjoyed this DVD series. Hard at times but overall a great way to bring the yoga/pilates routine right to your home! I recommend this DVD as a great way to augment your training.
3,This guy is boring!,"I love pilates, so I can always get something out of a pilates video. But I would prefer the instructor to be encouraging and appealing. This guy is boring as all get out! He makes the challenge to exercise even more challenging because we have to put up with his stiff character!"
4,Soothing,"I enjoy this DVD and pull it out often. It's a nice length (runs a little longer than the running time listed, closer to an hour), and a good combination of moves. The yoga moves are pretty easy though, so I do other yoga tapes when I want more, but the combination with the Pilates moves is what keeps me coming back. Good overall conditioning video."
1,Save Your Money,"Sorry to be so frank but this DVD sucks! I'm glad that I didn't spend my own money on this, but used a gift certificate. The movements between poses is so quick that I had a difficult time keeping up. Tom didn't allow you to stay in a pose long enough to achieve any benefit from it or enjoy it. His monotone directions make this DVD even more boring than it already is. I can't wait to receive my Jonathon Urla DVD's because this one is getting pitched."
4,An excellent review of the Mexican-American music scene.,"This book represents a scholarly analysis of music forms that are familiar to many Americans, yet whose origins are not always known. Mr. Loza obviously knows the material on a first-name basis and sets it out in painstaking clarity. Also included are interviews with notable purveyors of popular Latin music (Los Lobos, Poncho Sanchez, Lalo Guerrero, et al). For anyone with more than a passing interest in the richness of Mexican-American music and for lovers of its contemporary forms, this book provides a rich bed of information."
2,Works OK...but not great.,"It's a great idea, but needs some work. It looks great, and the features are all wonderful..but you don't get to appreciate them because the base is so light. As soon as the water is turned on, it falls over backward. I got more water on myself than my lawn. I finally gave up and got out my $10 sprinkler. Next time (I haven't given up yet), I'll try and place the legs in bricks or something else to hold it down. It's definetly more trouble than it's worth...but I already spent all that money on it, so I'll try and get some use out of it."
2,read this first,"great tripod, though sprinkler head is poor quality. i have two of these tripods and have replaced heads on both."
2,"Good idea, poorly implemented","The idea behind this product is sound, and the key innovation -- the tripod -- works nicely. But the sprinkler head itself was defective. Fortunately, it's a stock type, so I was able to cannabalize the head from another sprinkler I had around the house. But talk about getting the hard part right and then tripping over the easy part!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. This sprinkler will fail on you in less than a season. I purchased two from a local retailer. They were each over $40. I kept one unopened in the event that the first one failed in a year or two. I did not expect to have it start malfunctioning in less than 6 weeks and completely fail in 2 months. Furthermore, I made multiple attempts to reach the company and they NEVER responded. Orbit Irrigation needs to close its doors, as they are a terrible company with an inferior product. I wish I could offer an alternative, but if I can save one person from throwing away their money on this product, I will feel some relief."
1,Would be great if it worked!,Previous reviewers have noted my complaints--it stops turning after a short period (for me a matter of minutes). Requires strong water pressure to get it to start moving. Seeds of Change warehouse sale page offers this item for much less.
1,Save your money,The tripod portion works well but the sprinkler head is junk. After just 2 weeks it stopped rotating when under pressure.
3,Fantastic!! Great coverage!! Sturdy design!! Lasted 2 years,"One of my best purchases ever! I compared it to another version at Northern Tool... this one is better made, much less expensive, and with free shipping I couldn't be happier.Don't hesitate to buy this product!!It only lasted 2 years -- the place the hose attachesfell off... the pipe broke.I guess 2 years isn't bad"
3,Nozzle Not the Greatest,"The tripod is very easy to use and adjust. The spray nozzle is inefficient, even with fairly high water pressure."
4,Sprinkler,This worked exactly as I expected. Exceeded my expectations and has been very useful in trying to recover my lawn. I would buy another if needed.
5,"very pleased with the orbit sprinkler, works just as it said it would","works great, very pleased with the orbit sprinkler, quailty parts and great function,, the tripod is an added plus to reach out further"
5,GREAT manufacturer - customer service.,"Ordered product (Orbit 58308 Tripod base with brass spinkler head) through amazon and shipped through proXXX-, but the manufacuter was orbitz. the sprinkler head did not work so I filed a claim but didn't hear back from pro- so I called directly to Orbit the manufactuere. WOW, were they great. they shipped me a new sprinkler head without pause. I'd order direct from them anytime. Great customer service from Orbit."
5,Enlightening!!!!!!,"As a ""suicide survivor"" after the death of my younger brother, I found this book very enlightening. The suicide of a loved one leaves many unanswered questions for the survivors. Reading this book acknowledges many of the same feelings I had, and continue to have,after my brothers death. I hope with all my heart that my brothers spirit is watching over our family, as I miss him dearly every day. This book has brought me hope for my journey into the next life."
5,A Spiritual Eye Opener,"My little brother committed sucide and we later realized he was severly ill with Paranoid Schizophrenia. This book was brought to our attention by loving family members. Thank God they did. It has helped my mother and I to cope with things better and to understand what Suicide is from a childs point of view. You must be open minded enough to think about all the things Anne is trying to tell us. You just try to get as much as you can from this book, you don't have to agree with everything.I would like to mention that it has alot of things that coincide with both Native American beliefs and Christian...all you have to do is REALLY think about it don't take the words exactly for their face value....INTELLIGENCE.......I am a Native American full blooded, born and raised...."
1,Throwing this book away,"My boyfriend's son committed suicide this past year. We grieve and look for answers. There are none to be found here.You will grieve for Stephen whose mom did little to help him while he was alive.What's more disturbing is this woman's overarching sense of achievement. Although her son is dead, they ""communicate and have written this book together"". This woman did not attend a single teacher's meeting, nor engage any medical help, but somehow she's has won some kind of ""afterlife jackpot"". Hard stuff to swallow for those of us who fought more valiantly, lost a battle against clinical depression and miss our loved one dearly. Shame on Simon and Schuster for publishing this drivel."
1,bad news,"Okay- I've got some bad news. Stephen doesn't live. He's dead. He committed suicide.This book was written by Anne Puryear, pretending to be her dead son.Sick book, sick author.If I had a mother like Anne, I'd probably have offed myself too.This woman is a nut. She should be in jail."
1,Not Very Believable,"This is new age tripe at it's worst.We are asked to believe that Stephen killed himself and then dictated this ""book"" to his mother.The book is written by Anne Puryear, the mother, without an ounce of irony.This is certainly not a good book to give a depressed person. Why not kill yourself if you're still ""around"" afterwards to write books, talk to your loved ones and spew goofy advice.I'm not very critical of books- I like most everything.I didn't like this."
1,Having Problems With This One,"I hate to write a negative review, but I have real problems with this book.I'm sure I'm going to offend some people, but the very concept of this book offends ME.The book, which is meant to be taken seriously, is about a young boy who takes his own life by hanging himself from a tree. What a tragic end to a promising life. But that's not the end of the story- it's the beginning.According to the author, the boy's mother, the young man comes back to dictate most of this book from the afterlife.Sounds like a joke, but it isn't.I could say more, but I'll stop here. I'm sure overwhelming grief is responsible for some of the questionable judgement the author used.I'll end by saying I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and I would especially warn against giving this book to suicidal young men or women.They might just get an entirely different message than the one the author intended."
5,All Can Identify With Portions Of The Book,The depth and breath of the author's soul pours out to you. It's a book that reflects the heart and mind of a sensitive and caring person.
5,A perfect gift,"Marilyn Dean writes poetic notes to herself that reveal beauty, spirituality and strength. My Way Living Life Full Circle reveals her divine spirit through a human experience. Her poetry transcends mundane thoughts, life's pains, and life's treasures whose words enlighten and entertain. This book is a perfect gift to yourself or any woman."
3,Works with the weather,"I have been a porter cable user since I got into the carpentry trade and when this drill, saw combo came out I had to have it. The drill and saw are both great when you have a battery to use. The charger does not work when it is cold out or when it is too hot. Right now I have to buy a new charger because it just quit out of the blue for no apparent reason. Overall, if the saw and drill weren't so good I would just throw it away and start over."
1,tools great -Battery charger subpar,"I am a contractor that uses many porter cable tools. I am very disappointed in the tiger saw, especially battery life. I believe this to be a charger problem that affected the unit since it was new. The charger has now failed completely. I would think this issue would be important to Porter Cable as I see other complaints in other reviews."
2,NOT A HARD CHARGING TOOL,"I own the 19.2 volt 4pc combo set along with another drill and 2 extra batteries and charger, the tools are great, batteries seem to last a long time, but have already had problems with one of the chargers already, less than a year old and won't charge a lick. porter cable should scrap the chargers and go back to the drawing board with it."
2,Charger should not wear Porter Cable name,"I am buying another 19.2 V battery charger for my Porter Cable Drill. My Drill is only a little over one year old. I really love Porter Cable tools but I don't think this charger should wear the Porter Cable name. The design stinks. I could get mine fixed but it would probably cost as much as a new one. Where credit is due -- the doggone drill is super, very powerful, and turns at screaming RPMs. THE CHARGER? BOOO"
1,Bad Charger,"Like the other reviews, after about two years of light use around the house, the drill and batteries are great but the charger quit working. I contacted Porter Cable about this and their response was,""Our chargers hold up as well or better than the competition in all the testing we have done. Average charger life is approximately 1-1/2 years for all makes of batteries including Porter Cable. Obviously, battery life and performance are dependent on many variables. We do not have any type of exchange program for these chargers.""In the future, I will consider PC for other products but not cordless."
2,"Great Drill, Lousy Charger",This is my first venture into Porter Cable products and I think that PC had better straighten up when it comes to making faulty equipment for the public. The drill has plenty of power but the charger failed after only one year. That sucks!!!!!
3,Charger a dud - tools great,"After only three times of use the charger shorted out!!! Porter-Cable makes great tools, what happened with this???? ... When is Porter-Cable going to improve this charger and make it available to their customers?"
4,Cordless,"As a contractor we are always looking for good tools at a good price and durability is a must. We have been Porter-Cable loyalists for years and the 19.2 cordless line does not disappoint. However, in direct sunlight,as you would find when working outside in the summer, the charger and batteries overheat and charging is delayed. Conversely,in the winter they need to come up to ""temperature"" to begin charging and use time is, in my opinion, significantly reduced. My company owns several sets of these tools and we speak with some authority on the subject. Aside from this small difficulty this product WILL NOT DISAPPOINT you for its service, durabilty and quality construction"
1,I agree!!!,"Another ""bad charger"" review. Like others, I will not be buying PC equipment from now on. The charger just blew out one day, blew a breaker, and never worked again. Now I'm stuck getting another charger for my drill and saw. And PC won't acknowledge the problem, and offer new chargers to folks with bad ones. Very poor business choice, as their customers are drifting away.Hey Amazon, how come there isn't a '0' star rating. That's what this charger deserves."
3,Charger is Weak link in great tool set,"I have 3 PC 19.2v cordless tools, 2 chargers and 5 batteries. As others have reviewed, the tools are excellent! The charger, on the other hand, is so inconsistant that I am looking for a battery charge tester. It uses the same light signals to indicate 2 different conditions(very stupid!). It refuses to charge some batteries( occasionally overnight) w/o saying that they are too hot or cold(and they are not either hot or cold) or that they are bad. I personally think PC should be ashamed of putting this charger in the same package w/ its great tools!"
1,"Cult figure - A person who, once upon a time had talent, but threw it all away","This book tends to idolize junkie garcia by implying that he is a genius. Argentines like to pretend to be something they are not. this junkie cannot be compared to a lou reed, or a john lennon or a jim morrison. he can be better paired with yoko ono, paul maccartney, and brian wilson. he sells, but his later works not as well as his earlier stuff. a disposable book. something to pass the time with while on the commode."
3,My review,"This book,is good enough. As a Colege student I can easily understand what the author want to explain. But the structure of the pages, they're not interesting for me. For example, to explain about something that contains many points, the author place them in one paragraph, not in point like : 1. .... 2. .... 3. ...."
5,Good for the price,"Sony is one of the best electronic brands around. This Walkman is really easy to use, has good sound quality, and the batteries last a long time. The one thing I wish I had looked at was a Walkman that was AC/DC."
3,still love my cassettes,"My Sony Walkman from years ago, broke, when i dropped it. i was looking for the exact same one and lost out on e-bay. frustrated, i turned to amazon. they did not have my exact one, but this one is almost as good as the one i had before. I hate tinny sounding music. This one offers good bass and a good sound and operation for the money. I would recommend this cassette player for anyone out there like me who stll has alot of cassettes and enjoys listening to their older music.jan"
2,Cassette player,Item returned. Unable to rate the total item as the cassette tape player function was defective and ate the tapes. The radio seemed to work fine.
5,Just what I wanted,"The Sony Walkman is light, comfortable, easy to use and has made my daily walks enjoyable."
4,Sony WM-FX197 Walkman,"I have been using this walkman for about two months and I haven't had any problems. The quality of sound is very decent. The batteries last for more than 20 hours. The radio is good and the tape player works flawlessly. Taking into the consideration the price, it was a good purchase."
5,Solid and satisfying performer,"The player seems robust, not delicate like some players that shut off when jostled during my morning run. The rewind operation is fast. Altogether a nice little performer."
4,"Fine Product, But...","This is a fine, sturdy, simple AM-FM cassette player, easy for my 89 year old blind father to operate, but this price is incredible. It was less than $20 when I last bought it from Amazon a year or so ago. Now, it's not from but 'through' Amazon, and the price has quintupled. Too much for me, especially since it's still available for under $20 from other sources. Not like Amazon to let this happen."
5,nice music,they sent the wrong copy but stood behind it. i did have to pay to send it back a little hassle
5,The best thing to hit historical romance since sliced bread,"Alice Borchardt once again proves that she's the one who received all of the writing talent in the family, not her sister Anne Rice. With this second novel she has her faithful fans once again wrapped up in the world of medieval France, barely out of the dark ages. Her feminist herione Elin must this time face the possible loss of her improbably lusty bishop husband, this time to another woman. Anyone who likes their historical novels loaded with tons of sex and battle scenes, as well as betrayals, witchcraft, and the like, will love this book. And if you don't, you need to read it again."
4,Breath taking,I simply loved this book. The secondary characters make this book great. The only flaw is I wish there could have been more of these characters. And much more of Rosamund. Try to find the book anyway you can.
5,A brilliant novel,"This sequel to ""Devoted"" is every bit as wonderful. The characters seem to come alive, and what characters they are too! This novel has almost everything. Action (great battle scenes), love (very tasteful sex scenes), and humour in good doses. I found myself laughing out loud more than once. And there is also magic and fantasy, although not enough to make it a fantasy novel. Just enough to make those times seem very magical and mystical. There is also the clash of religion, pagan and Christian, but what shows through in the end is that good will always prevail over evil, and through love and kindness, evil can be turned into good. This is a wonderfully engrossing book....recommended."
5,Spellbinding historical fiction interwoven with fantasy!,The author draws you into the story like a bard of old. Fans of Mists of Avalon and Diana Gabaldon's sagas will love this
2,If I wasn't a fan I would have been bored to tears,"This video talks a good hype, but has damn near nothing to back it up. For instance, we only see and hear from Marcinko himself like three times. The sound quality is terrible. I mean TERRIBLE! We don't learn anything that we didn't all ready know. Well, if you knew absolutely nothing about Marcinko and Red Cell, then sure MAYBE you could come away with some new information. But for fans like me it is a total waste of time. What little video of the operations we do see is vague and doesn't show much of their training. Maybe their physical prowness. Bottom line, read the autobiography Rogue Warrior, you'll come away with a better sense of everything Marcinko has done and will know infinitely more than this video can teach you about Red Cell and it's mission."
3,Reality Check,"For those of you who have not read the book ""Red Cell"" this video would probably leave you asking yourself ""What the heck was all that about?"" I Believe this video is intended for those who have read the book and have a normal sense of curiosity to see for real what went on with Dick and his boys as described. I enjoyed it merely because it satisfied my curiosity. After reading the book, your so hyped up all you want is more."
3,Good and Bad,"First the Good:This collection includes a wide range of important Platonic dialogues and letters. It is by no means complete, but has enough selection of material to provide the reader a real basis for understanding Plato's thought processes as a whole. The vast majority of dialogues I have found to be of interest are found here.Now the bad.I found the language of the translation to be very difficult to get into. In general, a lot of these translations are not only more difficult for the modern reader but they are more difficult than other older translations of Plato's works that I have read. I found it rather difficult to get through this work.On the whole, I would give the selection 5 stars, and the translation 2 stars. However on the whole, I would give the work a mediocre 3 stars. It may be helpful to fill in some gaps in one's library, but I wouldn't recommend it as a primary Plato text."
5,THE COLLECTED DIALOGUES OF PLATO - A REVIEW,"THIS WAS A TEXTBOOK THAT I READ IN COLLEGE. IT CONTAINS VERY GOOD TRANSLATIONS OF THE DIALOGUES FROM GREEK INTO ENGLISH. IF YOU ARE STUDYING THE BEGINNINGS OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE WEST, THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE. PLATO USES SOCRATES AS THE MAIN INTERLOCUTOR IN HIS DIALOGUES; PERHAPS HE'S GIVING US A STYLIZED VERSION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. ARISTOPHANES IN ONE OF HIS PLAYS MAKES FUN OF SOCRATES' APPEARANCE, BUT THE YOUTH OF ATHENS SEEM TO HAVE REALIZED THAT SOCRATES WAS A TRUTH-SEEKER AND RALLIED ROUND HIM. THESE DIALOGUES SHOW US THE BEGINNINGS IN THE WEST OF THAT PHILOSOPHY BASED ON REALITY, AS OPPOSED TO THE BELIEF THAT ONE CAN ONLY KNOW ONESELF, BUT NEVER THE OBJECTIVE REALITY AROUND ONESELF. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN REALITY, START HERE! ."
4,It's lasted,"The introductions are a little silly. Ms. Hamilton never seems to like a dialouge if it has complex language. But, it's lasted. It's cheaper than the other, and.......How can you give a bad review to Plato?"
1,Inconvenient failure,"This phone worked well for about a month. I travel a lot and it is very unreliable on the road. Twice in the past two months it has just shut off and deleted messages. Missed all my birthday calls! Now the machine has just stopped working. Receives calls and shuts off after 7 seconds. This was a waste of money, even if it wasn't expensive. Because now I have to buy a new one and for the two prices combined, I could have had a great machine!"
5,muy buena,"les recomiendo la pelicual es muy buena y agradable para ver en familia, ya que habla sobre las realidades de nuestra sociedad"
5,Love this stuff,"Gilbert Hetherwick's Alice is a wonderful collection of songs that touch the heart and soul and show a side of ""Alice"" that you may not have heard."
4,Accessible first-time Faulkner,"This book is actually a chain of short-stories that Faulkner wrote during the mid-thirties and then collected them in novel form. For the beginning reader who wants to read Faulkner but is daunted by The Sound and the Fury or Absolam, Absolam!, The Unvanquished gives the skeletons of Faulkner's work-- the racial interplay, the fading glory of the South, familial conflicts and the politics of Reconstruction-- without the sometime burdens of his meatier prose. It's not a lightweight book, though. It is powerful and often neglected. I wrote my senior undergraduate thesis on this novel, and close reading just proved that even Faulkner's lesser works are better than a lot of other writers' masterpieces."
4,Great stories... but buyer beware,"A great opportunity to collect the early stories that are very hard to find. But, was somewhat disappointed to re-read parts of her Vows and Honor novels... books which are still very much available."
2,It was okay,"I was rather disappointed in this book. I bought it a couple of days after I had read the first book in the series, and thought it would be along the same lines, but I was disappointed to find out that it was just a collection of short stories.Bottom line: If you want to read it, check it out at the library."
4,Another good book for a collecter!,"I have never been able to find copies of the original Tarma and Kethry saga, as the ""Sword and Sorceress"" books are hard to find. I really enjoyed this book! It will make a fine addition to my Mercedes Lackey collection, next to the ""Vows and Honor"" Duology. Now all we need is some new stuff! Keep up the great work Misty!"
5,Well worth the wait,"Until I received this book I was unaware that it was a collection of the short stories that go with the ""Vows and Honors"" books. Most of these stories were previously published in ""Sword and Sorceress"" collections (edited by Marion Zimmer Bradley) over the years. As I had these I wasn't certain that only 1 new short story and a short novel would be satisfying. These stories are GOOD! They compliment the existing books and provide new information on what happened to these characters. It helps tie together ""Oathbound"", ""Oathbreakers"", and ""By the Sword'. The stories tell how Tarma and Kethry met, describes some of their adventures that were only hinted at in the other books, and tells what happens when they settle down to start their schools. Even if you have the already published stories you need this book! Here they are all pulled together, and it is definitely going to be more convenient than searching for each story. Very Good!! and let's all hope for more in the future!"
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book thinking it would be a continuation of the first two, and I was disappointed. The stories seemed out of order, and this could have been a great novel. Instead, I got a bunch of disjointed stories. Granted, it did explain a few things between Oathbreaker and By the Sword, but I really was disappointed. It's as if Miss Lackey didn't even try."
1,Not at all what I though I purchased!!! Deceived pic,"I am extremely unhappy with this company. I ordered a colorscience refill (see product picture) and received a much, much smaller size: 1g/0.03ozAlthough in the product description it does not say the size( at least I did not see it), the picture does not at all reflect the product.I feel I have been robbed. Unbelievable!!!!Not buying from them any more and will ask for a full refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Would purchase again,"I bought these shoes locally on clearance for $25. Wore them everyday for over 6 months in all types of weather and environments. One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Only reason I stopped wearing them daily was that the fabric on the inside of both shoes, especially at the heal, was worn away. Still wear them on occasion for yard work though."
5,good starting place for beginners....,I've routinely recommended this one to my clients; it's not for those already familiar with the depths but is a clearly written and workable guide for people just starting out in dreamwork and individuation.
5,Useful,"Clear basic text on using Jungian concepts in the study of dreams. Well written, insightful, good text for small group work."
5,On the unconscious,"I have previously read only one book on dream interpretation and think this one is excellent. I've always steered away from dream interpretation because I thought they were too mental for me. I am by nature an intellectual and caught up in daydreaming most of the time anyway. But Johnson tells me to bring feeling and body into the interpretation process, and that I like.He also warned against passive daydreaming concerning any real person for they will feel something over the collective unconscious. Compared inner work to marching around the walls of Jericho -- conquering a psychic center might take years of persistent work.All in all: simple and concise. I recommend it."
4,Last hurrah,"This is problably the last great album of ""The Prince of Bolero"". Going in I expected to listen to a great artist in decline. But much to my suprise I was wrong. This was his best album since ""Siempre Contigo."" If anything distinguishes this album from his other 80's albums it's that it's his most philosophical. The songs ""Que es el Amor"" and ""Me Voy""(which is a Piero composition)stand out the most. Overall the album is very good and I can happily assert that that every song is inspiring . Fans of ""The Prince"" will not be dissapointed."
5,Excellent,"When I preached through 1 John last year, this was the commentary I found myself referring to over and over again. Stott grasps the structure of the book well, is clear in his exegesis, and eloquent in his explanation of the text. As with all of his commentaries, here you find a rare blend of scholarship and simplicity, doctrinal precision and pastoral insight, exegetical skill and homiletical artistry. This was the only commentary (out of over a dozen that I own) that I read completely through."
2,Doesn't play multitones,Product doesn't play multiple tones of s-p-S. Only plays a single tone. The plug point needs an adapter for US outlets.
1,What?,"Maby I'm biased a little bit, but i found this book uninteresting and insulting to Robern Heinlein (may he rest in peace). I felt the book strayed too far from the original purpose of Heinlein's excellent book. This novel detailed the military aspect well, but completely missed the philosophical aspects of Heinleins book that made it a classic. The book is often thought of with the movie, even though they are nothing alike. It is unfortunate that this other seemed to have never even read the novel Starship Troopers, much less adhered to its purpose."
5,"""C'mon you apes! Do you want to live forever?""","Dark Horse, justly famous for developing fine movie based comics like the Aliens and Predator lines, does it again with this excellent Starship Troopers graphic novel. The book contains three stories; the first details mankinds first encounter with the Arachnids, the second tells the tragic tale of Port Joe Smith, and the third is the story of the movie itself. The artwork in the first and third stories is stunning. Crisp, clear and full of technical detail, it perfectly captures the slightly glossy feel of the movie. The art in the second story is less impressive, but no less powerful. The writing throughout is superb, a perfect mirror to the ""gung-ho"" attitude of both novel and film. If you're a fan of ""Starship Troopers"" in any form, do yourself a favour and buy this book. You won't regret it."
3,It doesn't bring much new to the table,"This first part of this comic tries to go into the philosophy of the film, the federation, and the bugs, but it comes out too concentrated and ambiguous. The artwork is decent, but not amazing. The second part of the comic is a retelling of the movie in an extremely concentrated form, and is kind of disappointing. Basically, this seems to be exclusively for fans who love both Starship Troopers (film version) and comic books."
1,Sent me a super-old version,"After ordering, the vendor emailed me and said that the one he had didn't quite look like the picture. I said that was fine and send it to me anyway. My bad. The one I received looked like it was 10 years old. The attachments were so small that it wouldn't fit over my front fork (I guess they used to be skinnier 10 years ago).In the end I went to REI and bought the Cateye Velo 5."
4,This film is excellent.,"This film shows the story of once wicked girl who decides to mend her ways. It shows some of the problems that some girls have as they grow up. This movie is about matchmaking, romance, and love. It shows a the depth of love from a man for a woman he loves in a very touching way."
4,Undeserving Emma,"This movie is really hard for me to rate. I loved the plot and I liked most of the characters. My main problem with this movie was Emma herself. I didn't like her. She was a snob and very meddlesome, which I guess is the whole point of the story. She was so unlikeable that even after her transformation, I still didn't think she deserved a fairy tale ending. Besides the ending though, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it."
4,Entertaining,"Although matchmaking can sometimes lead to beautiful love stories, sometimes it ends in disaster. Overall, an enjoyable and entertaining movie!"
5,Jane Austen's sometimes goofy Emma is a winner!,"I enjoyed this version of the Emma saga ! It was acted so well, and I prefer this one over several others I have viewed."
3,"True to novel, but awful quality","Kate Beckinsale made a lovely Emma, much better than Gwen Paltrow, however, I still prefer the theatrical film better. It just seemed less stiff and less formal. Emma is not as serious as some of the other novels and I though the A&E version was heading more in that direction. The actual picture quality is very poor and grainy, very dark looking. Again, its hard not to compare the 2 versions. I did like the portrayal of Jane Fairfax in this version better than in the other version. She just seemed more interesting and mysterious here. I barely noticed the musical score, it didn't stand out at all. The costumes were nice to look at and the locations were pretty. Also, as a side note, it was nice to notice that Emma's house is the same mansion they used as Mr Jennings's house in Sense and Sensibility, my favorite Jane Austen film."
2,Not the Emma Jane Austen described,"This version of Emma doesn't begin to capture the essence of the heroine, Emma. Jane Austen's Emma, while possessing some inbred snobbery, is still a highly likable, innocent character who develops and matures as the story moves. The Emma in this adaptation is not only snobby, she's boring and seriously lacking qualities to make her even likable. The whole video lacks the lightheartedness Jane Austen infused in her book and which the Gwyneth Paltrow version captured so beautifully. If you liked the book, get the Gwyneth Paltrow & Jeremy Northam version instead, and save yourself a lot of disappointment."
4,depends on what you are looking for,"If you are looking for pure entertainment, I think the Hollywood version is the one for you. It succeeds in accomplishing it's purpose, to merely provide an audience with a couple hours of mixed feelings. And the Hollywood version does a great job of that. I thought it was a great movie. However, if you are looking for a movie with a little more meat, go with this one. All the characters, particularly Emma, are much better developed and 3 dimensional in the A&E version. If you are looking for a movie that relates closely to what the author was trying to say, a movie that makes a statement about something, rather than providing mere entertainment, definely, go with the A&E version."
3,Bad quality,"Good movie - read others reviews of it. I can only comment on the poor, dim, grainy quality of this DVD. Maybe there's a better recorded edition, but this sure wasn't it. Too bad. This 1997 version looks like it was recorded in the 80's."
5,Wonderful adaptation of the book,"One hour and forty six minutes is not nearly enough time for this video to convey the nuances of the Jane Austen book. Too bad A&E et. al. didn't have the courage to develop it further, as they did previously with Pride and Prejudice.That aside, however, everything contained within the 106 minutes of this video is superbly presented and wonderfully true to the book. Superior to the Gwyteth Paltrow version, in my humble opinion, which came out the same year. This film rightly understands that the book is not simply about a self-deluded matchmaker, but about a spoiled yet good hearted rich girl growing into responsibility and womanhood.I loved every page of the book, and aside from its brevity, this movie did not disappoint as an adaptation."
3,Not as Likeable,"I write this as I am currently watching this version on Ovation Network. I do not like the characters in this adaptation as well as the ones in Paltrow version. They all seem much older than what I envisioned them to be based on the book. And none of them seem as likeable. This Emma is much more snobbish and doesn't seem to have the kindness as she does in either the book or Paltrow chracter. That kindness made Emma bearable even in her few episodes of snobbery (her insult of Mrs. Bates at the picnic). Miss Bates is portrayed as being quite elderly and would not likely be in the company of those of Emma's generation. In fact, even Emma is portrayed as older than the 21 years she is supposed to be. The only character I liked better in this version was Harriet SmithI don't think I would have liked this version even if I hadn't seen the other one first."
3,Good adaptation,"I was pleased when I purchased this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. A long-time fan of Clueless, I was overjoyed to find a good translation in video form.I rated this higher than the 1996 version (starring Gwyneth Paltrow). I think it is a better version overall, and Kate Beckinsale does a great job portraying Emma."
4,In opposition ...,"I bought this DVD on the strength of several Amazon reviews that asserted it was ""much better"" than the Gwyneth Paltrow version. In fact I found it to be about the same quality in acting and not quite up to the Hollywood version in production values. Most importantly (contrary to the opinion expressed by one Amazon reviewer), it takes a good deal of license with Austen's original story. In particular, the hidden relationships and feelings that are essential to the story line are telegraphed by not so subtle glances and innuendo and several substantial changes to Austen's original. Since the story line in the novel is flawed, this could have been an improvement. In fact, the results are mixed."
3,Very Disappointing,"I expect the best from A&E and I am hardly ever disappointed, but I was with this adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. I don't think the characterization was accurate at all! Every actor/actress was completely different than I had imagined them while reading the novel countless times. I hate to say it, but I think the Hollywood version was immensely better. Gwyneth Paltrow was the perfect Emma. I felt like this version lost so much of the irony and humor that the novel and Jane Austen are famous for. I do not recommend this version."
5,emma,movie was just what i ordered. it arrived in a timely manner and great shape. i will use this co. again.
5,Jane Austen's Emma,"A wonderful movie that youngsters can watch with NO ill effects from the attendant sex and violence that are hallmarks of Hollyweird. An English novel put to film. No breakneck pace--just a good, decent movie!"
4,"Emma was a humourous, funny, and romantic movie.","I loved both versions of Emma, although I felt that the Kate Beckinsdale version was better, because the portrial of Emma and the lifestyle lived at that time was better portrayed. I felt that the Paltrow version was to slow in getting to the point. Both versions of Emma are excellent!!! It's a must see movie!!!"
3,Decent adaptation...,"...which, unfortunately, sets the wrong tone. Much of the original, elegant humor is lost, and some of the characters are miswritten."
3,3 maybe 3 1/2,"Not quite what I was expecting, but it's a cute movie. Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility get 5 stars in my book. But this is a good movie too."
4,A Good Enough Rendition,"Kate Beckinsale charmingly portrays my favorite Jane Austen heroine in this production of Emma. The only negative comment I can make is that it is too short of a film. If they had allowed for more time, like in the BBC production of Pride & Prejudice, the story could have been even better."
4,"Not as good as Gwyneth Paltrow version, but worth seeing","I'd actually give it 3.5, but rounded up. Kate Beckingsdale does a pretty good job of portraying Emma, but I like Gwyneth Paltrow better. Mark Strong is too angry as Mr. Knightley and is yelling all of the time. I found nothing in Jane Austen's book to support this characterization. I do like Harriet Smith in this version. Her naivete is more believable than Toni Collette's.If you are a great Jane Austen fan, go ahead and buy it. You'll need all of the Emma productions for your collection!!"
2,A very one dimensional Emma,"Kate Beckinsale's performance, to me, seemed extremely one dimensional. We certainly see the vanity, but none of the compassion which makes Emma a worthy (albeit immature) hero traveling along her arc. By comparison, Gwenyth Paltrow's performance (within a year) shows us a misguided socialite, who repeatedly displays compassion.The best example might concern Emma's view of Martin. While Paltrow tells us he is beneath her, she also points out that were he less fortunate (than he is), she would feel honor bound to help him. Kate's Emma, on the other hand, simply despise him for no good reason.Having watched both features back to back, Beckinsale strike's me as a twin sister of Mrs. Elton, rather than Austin's kind-hearted, but misguided Emma.I would recommend forgoing this version and taking Paltrow's instead."
3,Did not Emma,"I enjoyed all the characters except the main character. She came across as mean spirited, bigoted, immature and self-centered. There was nothing ""heroic"" about this heroine. The ending was nice but not sufficiently developed.After seeing (and thoroughly enjoying Pride and Prejudice), my expectations were great.I was disappointed -- not so much with the adaptation but with the character development. There was little that was likable about this characer. Maybe if this was a 2 dvd set as was Pride and Prejudice, the more positive characteristics of Emma would have been better developed and exhibited.This was a pale ""copy"" of Pride and Prejudice or even Sense and Sensabilty.Now, I'll be forced to view GP's version."
4,Better than Gwyneth,"What would you expect?...When they promote the Paltrow version with a showy photo of her cocking a bow, and the title, ""Cupid is Armed and Dangerous.""This version is completely faithful to period detail, speech cadence and to the novel's plot itself. It's every bit as good, in fact, as A & E's ""Pride and Prejudice."" And, as others have pointed out, it suffered from the hype surrounding the other version.Since Emma's character is not as overbuilt as it is in the other version, you are free here to enjoy Emma more profoundly, without having to create Emma as a buffoon. It's much more rewarding to experience this Emma finding love herself. Complete enjoyment!"
5,Jane Austen's Emma,"Although I used standard shipping, I received this item is record time: two days before the estimated delivery date, and two days after I placed the order! Item was also in condition as advertised. I'm VERY pleased. Thank you!"
4,Lovely and entertaining,I liked this movie very much. Although I had seen it previously I enjoyed watching it again and enough to purchase it for future viewing. The acting is good and the story is very sweet.
4,Enjoyable,"Whether the Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow was as true to the novel or not....it was just simply more entertaining than this one. And, the characters in this one aren't as likeable. Emma was not someone I was rooting for and I think that's important. I felt like many of the characters were not cast well. But, I did enjoy the movie and would watch it again. This Emma just doesn't have the life to it as the Emma with Gwyneth."
4,An enchanting movie,"I think this DVD offers a good, clear quality to this well-made movie, it makes all that much more enjoyable to watch one of my favorite movies without been distracted."
5,My Favorite Version,"I absolutely love this version of Emma; I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as Emma and Mr. Knightly. The scenery, performances, screenplay, and attention to detail combine to make this a wonderful adaptation.I have another verson of ""Emma""; but nobody does Jane Austen better than A&E;/BBC. Their attention to details such as costume, music, scenery, food, etc. can't be beat."
4,a tale of two Emma's....,"let me preface this by saying I haven't read the novel yet. This version of Emma is a darker (in comparison) version when reviewed next to the Gwneth Paltrow version. Both versions are enjoyable, and have their own set of good and bad points. This version's main sticking point with me is the lighting, which gives most of the movie a dreary dark outlook. But on the plus side, there are scenes in this version that are great additions-I especially like the final scene where Knightley invites his tenants to his wedding-much to the vicar's wife's dismay-which is very enjoyable as they are two stick in the mud's. Mark's Strong's portrayal of Knightley is different than Jeremy Northern's, but not worse, just different.I would recommend this movie to any period movie buff. I like different versions of the same movie-kind of like different versions of the same recipe. Different, but still tasty! 4 stars!"
2,Boring,"I watched this adaptation on television. I thought that I would enjoy it (I had enjoyed the theatrical version with Gwyneth Paltrow), but I was mistaken. This one just couldn't hold my interest, and I was watching the clock throughout, waiting for the whole boring mess to be over with. It's only been a couple of weeks since I watched it, and I can barely remember anything that happened. I guess it really couldn't hold my attention!I can't comment on whether or not it was a faithful adaptation from the book. When I tried to read it a few years ago, I got bored and never finished. Having recently watched six adaptations of the Jane Austen works on Masterpiece Theatre, I can say that, for me, ""Emma"" is the weakest of the bunch."
4,Far superior to the Gwyneth Paltrow version,"Compared to this version, the Gwyneth Paltrow version really does appear ""clueless."" This version of ""Emma"" is superb. Don't waste your time with Gwyneth Paltrow."
2,I'm surprised everyone liked this so much!,"After looking at several reviews for this product (having already watched it myself), I must say I am surprised at the strong reviews. I thought Emma and Mr. Knightley were NOT cast well at all. Since you know they get together in the end, you'd expect some kind of cameraderie and friendship to come through. Instead, they act like they dislike each other much of the time. I know they quarrel in the book, but this felt more mean-spirited to me...in real life it's unlikely this couple would have fallen in love! This version lacked the charm of the Gwyneth Paltrow version and especially the latest Romola Garai version, where Mr. Knightley really does seem like an older brother who genuinely cares about Emma. With the latter two Emmas to watch, who needs this one?!"
2,Nah. Don't bother.,"I might have enjoyed this more if I hadn't already seen the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma. This one just doesn't capture the essence of Jane Austen's excellent novel. Usually I can console myself by looking at the costuming or the scenery, but even that didn't do it. I just kept wondering who cast this one. Especially the actor who played Mr Knightley. Yoicks!"
5,Wonderful and rich!,"Kate Beckinsale is pure delight as Emma, and the entire cast is up to snuff, making this DVD a ""no-brainer"" purchase. The atmosphere is rich with period effects and the clothing is superb. All in all, a great fun time with a satisfying dose of the elegance and formality which Austen fans should relish. I love the period of the early nineteenth century as found in all of Jane Austen's work; so much so that I was inspired to write my own work of fiction set in Regency England, like all of Jane's stories. (Guess I just couldn't get enough of it!)Linore Rose Burkard, author, Before the Season Ends"
3,"Definitely not ""My Mr. Knightley""","The Gwyneth Paltrow version is defintely better -- hands down!!There were several aspects of this film that I disliked, but Mark Strong's portrayal of Mr. Knightley was the most devastating blow. He always seemed angry and out of temper. Jeremy Northam was the perfect Knightley. He is handsome, witty, and gentlemanly, and I guess I can never watch another version without thinking of him as the ideal fit.The movie is also very choppy. The pace moved too rapidly.Overall, I don't regret purchasing the movie, but it definitely won't usurp my Gwyneth Paltrow version."
5,"Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match","I was going to avoid this film as I was I was under the impression that it would be contemporary with period dress. However, I decided to give it a go. Well I am pleasantly surprised to find that Jane Austin shows through on the film. Not maybe the heavy satirical Jane but the one I came to like in such films as ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995).It is rural 1800s England. Young Emma Woodhouse (Gwyneth Paltrow) accidentally brings two people together to make a perfect match. Now she knows her avocation; it is a propensity to make other perfect matches. While rather poorly perusing her avocation she is unaware of her own feelings for her best friend and mentor, Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam).Of course we know what is going on from the get go. However it is fun anticipating Emma's mistakes and waiting for the lights to come on in this comedy of manners.Sense and Sensibility [Blu-ray]"
2,The Frank Churchill Story,"The relationships between the characters are all out of balance. We see far too much of Frank, we get a mean and nasty Knightly, an Emma few would love, the Elton's are cartoonish, and the tacked on ending - the Harvest Festival - bringing in the sheaves, we will come rejoicing, bringing...is nothing Austen ever wrote, anywhere! The set piece dance at the end featuring the, here, three couples joined in bliss, Knightly and Emma, Frank and Jane, and Harriet and Robert Martin (Robert Martin? What, you didn't know he was a dancer?) is just contrived romantic twaddle.Hiss. Boo. So NOT Austen."
2,Not the Emma for me,"After viewing this version of Emma I was very disappointed ... The humor, tenderness,and interplay between Emma and Mr Knightly was lost in this version. Get the other version for the music, story, characters and beauty of the unfolding love between Emma and Mr. Knightly."
3,This Emma Deserves a Better DVD Release,"I am one of those who thinks that this (Kate Beckinsale's) version of Emma is the best one to date. I finally broke down and purchased the DVD (already had it on VHS), only to be disappointed. For some reason, this was released as a full screen, old ""pan & scan"" version. It was reshown on PBS not long ago and it clearly was originally made in some ratio of widescreen. Don't know why A&E did this, except that in 1997 most TVs where not yet widescreen. Also the print does look rather dark in some places; but more than that, because of the ""pan & scan"" cutting, one misses so much of the lovely scenery. Have no idea if this will ever get a more proper release, so I'm glad I have it nevertheless. Do hope it will get a better release someday."
3,Emma & Mr. Knightly just didn't seem right in this version..,"Although the A&E version does develop the characters more than the Hollywood version with Gwenyth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam I don't think it's better. My main problem with this version is the two main characters, Emma and Mr. Knightly. They don't look ""right"" together and there doesn't seem to be any chemistry. In fact, they don't even seem to like each other much at all.I think the Paltrow-Northam version shows much better a relationship between two people who care about each other and then fall in love. This version makes it seem like two bickering psuedo-siblings suddenly decide they love each other. It just never felt right to me.That said, I think the A&E version is better at portraying every other character. The Hollywood version made the other characters so extreme they were more laughable than realistic."
4,Review of Everyman's Demosthenes,"This volume presents an excellent collection of Demosthene's most famous orations. Included are On the Crown, all the Phillipics and Olynthiacs, as well as several other important and interesting pieces. Each of the speeches, even those consisting of only a few pages, are given significant introductions of about 1/2- 1 full page. There is also a well-done introduction and chronology before the speeches, giving background on Demosthenes' life and times. The work is supplemented by footnotes, and an appendix on Greek money and mining. I found the appendix thoughtful (albeit from a European perspective I didn't quite understand... pounds, shillings, etc.), but I couldn't quite understand why it was attached to this volume. Another small issue was the size of the text. The introductions are given in very small font that might prove unreadable for some older readers.To conclude: good translation, great introduction and footnotes, with unfortunately small font."
3,"A honest and much needed book, but still too timid.","This book discusses several inconsistencies of Quantism at a rather informal level, seasoned with numerous anecdotes involving some of the main contributors to its birth, rise and fall. A second book, stressing that Aspect's experiments definitely disproved Quantism, would be most welcomed."
1,"So Many People, so little story.","I don't know the author and had no idea what to expect from this story. Love this kind of adventure, undiscovered territory (for me). Well, I have to say this is the most complicated, confusing story ever, not in plot but in mass of characters. I read almost 1/2 the book and was so tangled with so many names, so many characters all related or wanting to be, that I gave up. But then I thought to try again, but this time I mapped a list of characters as I read. This helped greatly but suddemly I thought this was all a joke. Characters kept appearing for maybe short amounts of time and then more appeared and at the end of the day I never knew or cared about anyone. Just exhausting and I hate to give up, but will because the story is starting to become completely annoying. Maybe I'll try again another time...or not.I read the Amazon Kindle book."
5,Great for Getting Up Self Adhesive Tiles,This puppy works great. I have run for several hours while prying up self-adhesive floor tiles and have had no problems. It's light weight and the handle does not get overly hot so you can use it without a glove.
4,"High quality, does the job","I have used the 8977-20 heat gun from Milwaukee for one entire day. It was on virtually the entire time for the purpose of removing varnish. It is light weight, quiet and provides ample heat for the job. The temp control is conveniently located at the rear of the gun. My only suggestion would be to provide a stand that would allow it to point upwards without blocking the airfow. It does have a flip-out stand but it rests the gun on the air intake. Other than that minor point, it is a great product"
4,College student,"This is a collection of twelve poems. The humorous poems are about creatures that are strange. There was a creature that gobbled up items in a classroom, including the teacher! One was a Dreary Dreeze, and this one needed to not squeeze anyone. The Grubby Greebles chewed gravel as they traveled. The Slithery Slitch, who was rich, rode in a limousine.This was a funny book. I especially enjoyed the one about the creature eating the teacher. The illustrations complimented the poetry well. This book will help to make poetry fun!"
2,Unreliable,"It ""forgets"" it has a call waiting function every so often...I have to power it down and reset it every couple of weeks...disappointing. That's why I'm on this site, searching for a replacement."
2,Messed up little machine,"The features are great: the machine beeps when you have a call waiting alert (to replace the traditional ""beep"" tone that Call Waiting made that Caller ID takes away), it flashes a light when you have a new call so that when you get home you can see immediately if you have received any new calls, and the display is nice and large. The unit itself is very easy to use.However, my unit always indicates that I have a ""beep"" (Call Waiting) but there isn't any! At least once every 15 minutes per call it does this. It is extremely annoying. It has gotten to the point where I don't even check for other calls anymore because I have a feeling it's just the machine malfunctioning.I should have listened to the other two reviewers who gave negative reviews. However, they didn't apply to my situation. So please think about this purchase carefully. I am going to have to return this item and maybe try the ATT one amazon.com has listed. Be careful!"
3,Rash Math or padded volume?,"It is the treatment of the Riemann hypothesis that really bothers me:mostlythe ERH ( extended Riemann Hypothesis) which is introduced with a badly or incompletely defined phi(n) function).With chapter notes and problem solutions there is less to this book than the size ( page number suggests) so this volume is more of notice by what is left out or left to volume two.The algorithms are all in pseudo-code and there is no bridge to actual computer programs that you might expect from where Jeffrey Shallit teaches( Maple country).I was disappointed with this book and I dislike the abstract mathematics style in a book that is supposed to be about computer algorithms.You are left with a definite ""snob without a cause"" feeling."
5,Historic and Mid Century Moder Phoenix Architecture,"While there has been much significant architecture in Phoenix since this book was published, this book is still useful and interesting, especially for the historic and mid-century modern buildings it includes. This is essentially a picture book with a brief blurb about each building, including the street address. A chapter on the past and planned evolution of Phoenix is particularly interesting."
2,Not for Dummies!,"I was disapointed with this kit! I couldn't look through the book becuase it was shrink - wrapped with the compiler, so I had no way of knowing that it was for experienced users of the C language. The author himself suggests that you ""put the book back on the shelf"" if you aren't already programming in C. So I was completely lost from chapter 2 and beyond. Although he gives some great examples of Object - oriented programming concepts in the beginning, this book will collect dust on my shelf until I am able to learn the language from another source. Not a good way to start with C++."
5,Nice Book,A well written book with clearly explained concepts. A useful reference for air pollution control and engineering work.
3,Jfinney,"The text is not very readable for ease. However, it's redeaming quality is the section to practice the entire design process including econ. Ch 9 is a look into the industry."
4,"Book was good, but limited use during my PE exam","I got this book to help me counter the questions asked in the PE exam on air pollution control. Although this book was bought for limited scope, it served me well during the exam."
4,"Works like it should, but pricey","The cable works perfectly and was obviously professionally made. They worked great for bridging our LIU to our switch across the wall at gigabit speeds, and I would expect much higher if necessary. The price seems to have gone up slightly since I bought it, making it not as great of a deal, even with the fast Prime shipping.This identical cableis a better deal if you can find it in stock."
2,Not engaging,"Perhaps this book became dated, as several of the short stories seem to have been intended as political satires, which may not be so relevant anymore.Perhaps there is a problem with the translation, as it was suggested by one of the reviewers here.Or perhaps it's just a question of personal taste. The fact is, I didn't like it. It doesn't seem to have been written with the intent of engaging the reader. It's rather a collection of very short stories - 36 in 175 pages - in which even the humor and the witticism did not convince me.I would have difficulty in pointing out a single very good story, in my opinion. Some of them I found OK, and some I read without any pleasure."
5,Good Stuff,"Being a healer and a spiritual advisor for the past 6 years, I have to suggest getting this DVD for your collection. I've read some of the negative reviews and decided to see for myself about this. I'm not sure what the other people that reviewed this had expected to see, but there are some very prominent spiritual people (leaders) in this giving their opinion on the subject of ""oneness"". What I think some of these reviewers do not understand is that to actually get an audience with some of these individuals and to have these questions answered is not an easy task, However the makers of this movie did a great job in doing just that. For anyone on a spiritual journey, this is a nice uplifting collection of interviews to help ponder what life means to you. This movie should be considered in the same respect as ""The Secret"" and ""What the Bleep?""."
1,Worthy Effort. Poor Result.,"Havin read all the reviews for this movie, I decided to take a chance. I'm very sorry that I purchased this movie. The interviews are interesting, and Robert Thurmann is wonderful, as usaul, as is Thomas Keating. However, the quality of this movie is terrible. I understand that the filmmakers are amatures, but that said, maybe they should leave filmmaking to the professionals. I would much rather watch ""What the Bleep"" or ""Peaceful Warrior."" Some people will support this movie because they believe in it's message, as do I. However, it's hard to enjoy the spirituality in this film when the quality is so poor. Also, the idea of being ""one"" is suddenly dropped in at the end of the film, as if the ""filmmakers"" realized that they had no story."
5,ONE shines with the enery of REAL people,"ONE is just another movie. Yet it tells the story of REAL people; that makes all the difference.ONE: The Movie shares an energizing story about a family who decides to follow a nudge from within and ask the big questions of life about peace and war, life and death, the meaning of it all. However, the filmmakers and audience discover that it is not about finding the answers, but meeting the people who believe in them. ONE: The Movie is about relationships.Some reviews I've read have dwelled upon feelings that interviews of individual spiritual leaders were ""truncated,"" and disconnected. But complete interviews of individuals' perspectives is not the point. ONE is not about any one person, but about the community of many who speak with voices and similarity and difference.ONE: The Movie challenges us to live our lives truly, to love fully. Watch ONE with a friend or family member. Feel the power of living and loving from your core."
5,Incredible insight,"sorry to all you who wrote bad reviews. I found it insightful leaving me with lots of questions of my own to explore and discover. It gives you just enough from each person to understand their ideas.I have watched it 3 times now and get something out of each viewing.The fact that they are amateurs reminds me that I too can do anything I set my mind to. I have recently left the business ""world"" to explore my dreams and this movie helps to remind me that I too can do what my soul needs and desires if I put my heart into it.Thank you guys for making this movie, I find it inspiring!!!"
2,Lacking Content,"This movie had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it includes a lot of meaningless transitions inserted for some 'artistic' value. It is extremely disappointing to spend so much time looking at nothing when you could be listening to the priceless wisdom of the spiritual leaders that they interviewed. They asked 20 questions during the interview, and gave you the answers from a few of the people for SOME of the questions. Not even all the questions are covered. Not to worry, however, you can purchase each interview separately on their website for ONLY 9.95 each. This information should have been covered in the movie.There are some very insightful answers given by many people, but too many transitions where there should be valid content."
5,enjoyed this film and it's message.,"I also agree with one of the reviewers about some of the unfair ratings. This film was done by a couple of guys who had never done anything like this in their lives and were still reading the instruction manual on the equipment during filming. I think that is precisely what adds to it's authenticity and vulnerability. The point is the message. I wouldn't say it was incoherent by any stretch. I have a hard time understanding what was so laughable (see review above) about the idea of ""oneness"" as the word 'religion' denotes and how that is the common thread with most systems of beliefs. I think the only akwardness was with the black and white sequences. I felt that made it a little choppy. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it and was moved."
1,available elsewhere for much less,"The 19.2 volt Krypton bulbs for Craftsman worklights are made by Dorcy International of Columbus, Ohio and available online. Even though some Sears stores never seems to have the bulbs in stock and they aren't available here, Dorcy sells them for less at their Dorcy Direct web site."
2,Still waiting for it to get shipped!!!!,"whatever you do, DO NOT buy this from amazon itself. Maybe pick one of the other places they offer. I made the mistake of ordering it from amazon a month ago and it still hasnt shipped. At this point I wont bother changing it to the other places cause even those dont say when shipping would be available.Really disappointed with amazon...how long does it take to get this item and ship it to me?as far as the bulb itself. I'm buying it to replace a burnt out one a Craftsman since sears never has it in stock.Good luck buying this from amazon...be prepared to wait over a month for it."
5,Awesome,"I took the old bulb out. Replaced it with the new one and when I hit the switch, BAM! The Light came on!"
3,Clear sound but low bass,"This unit delivers clear music, but the bass is low. The speaker wires are permanent and short. It does not have a AUX input and I could not connect my DVD player."
5,excellent,I was soooo happy to find this cd. I can remember these songs by this artist from the 1970's and 80's when I saw them in person. These are the original songs that were on the vinyl records I owned-- way back then. I love it! Wish I could find more by this artist.
5,Marshall Family CD Such an Enjoyment to Hear,"We Really Enjoy This CD its Peaceful, Beautiful, and Encouraging!!!We Can Sit and Listen Over and over for hours I have Both Volumesand they are such a blessing to hear!!"
5,the marshall family,hooooooooooly cow!!! what a wonderful cd. great bluegrass gospel. gotta make sure u get vol 1 and 2 of the marshall family.
2,A Very Second Feature,"I remember full supporting programmes in cinemas. And have a great fondness for second feature films. Even some of those I cringed at at the time. Many can now be enjoyed. However there were also those little films that were skipped. Missed by arriving after they had played. Staying instead longer at home. Or calling into a cafe,coffee bar or pub.This is such a film. With the below parr picture and sound quality. Do what I should have done. Pass."
4,Cute holiday collar for your dogs,"The product was as pictured. Shipped to us in a timely manner. There was only one issue, which was one of the bells fell off about a day after. My wife was able to sew it back on."
5,"Jingle dog, jingle dog, jingle all the way...","I love this collar so much, I may keep it on the dog all year! We've had many compliments on our shetlie's ""jingle collar"" and the four large bells really do jingle quite nicely. As another commenter said, it's handy knowing just where your dog is at all times. When she scratches her head, she's a jingling fiend.It's also very attractive and is a nice color for our sable-colored sheltie. The only problem is, her fur seems to rub off on the collar, so much so that the red fades from being covered in white neck hair! And I'd go a size up on these collars. I got the medium for my 35-pound sheltie and it's loose enough, but I think a large would have been a more comfy fit. They seem to run small.At first, Teddy the Dog was not crazy about all that jingling, but she seems to like it now. She's our happy little Christmas dog."
5,PERFECT!,My fiance and I have been trying to find a holiday collar for our Siberian Husky and this is the first one we found we both liked. Our boy turned 8 yrs old in November so that gives you some idea of how rare it is for both of us to agree on the same thing. LOL!
1,"Pretty Collar, Poor Stiching","At first I was very pleased with this collar. It is soft, stretchy and has a great jingle sound. However, within the first 5 minutes my dog scratched off one of the bells. I inspected the stiching upclose and found missed stiches all over the place. The bells were held on by one piece of string. The collar was in the trash even before the packaging materials had been thrown out. Its not the sellers fault. They shipped the product promptly. No jingling for my pup this year."
5,Love this for the holidays or anytime really!!,"I ordered a size large for my sheltie only because of his mane and long fur....They come tru to size and are elasticized and seems well made. He didn't like it for a moment only because it jingled, but that only took a couple of minutes for him to get used to. This is a great item for the holidays or if in the middle of training your doggie to help locate him I would think. It is loud enough to know if he wants outside or figure out what room your dog is in...I love it personally and I will use it for the holiday times. Very cute and the family all took pictures of him as well.."
4,Good historical remake,"This book is a remake of old documents of Taira Shinken. He was one of the most important Okinawa Kobudo masters and wrote a lot of papers about Kobudo, especially Bo Jutsu Katas. This book "" Encyclopedia of Okinawa weapons"" has only a small but important number of different Katas. It is very interesting to see the change of these Katas in modern books and videos, partiallly because of new ideas of onother master or because they have forgotten the original modification. I think it is an important book for martial artist. The price is good and is value for the content.Helmut Kogel M.D., Professor of Surgery5.Dan Shotokan Karate Renshi ( IMAF)5.Dan Kobudo ""2.Dan Nihon Jujutsu1.Antas Combat ArnisRegional Director IMAF"
1,Blank Disc?,"Disc was defective,tried on multible DVD players and PC.Product was void.Reordered,same ending.Promo appears very interesting and remarkable,but disc was BLANK!Very displeased.Would like to view actual product.Post Script: I give positive feedback and was impressed with Amazon's return and replace attempt.Very Professional and helpful.Great Job.Thanx Amazon.JP"
5,Great Heat Gun,"I have been using this heat gun, where I work, for almost a year. I have spent about 1000 hours using it to strip paint and it works just like the day I first got it. I have stripped paint that was literally a quarter of an inch thick or more with this heat gun and I had not problem getting the paint hot enough to scrape off. Milwaukee did an excellent job designing this gun. The fan does a good job of blowing the heat out, which I think is one of the most important things to look for in a heat gun, besides the temperature it heats up to.I recommend this tool to anyone, whether you are a do-it-yourselfer or a full time painter, it is a great heat gun."
5,Hot!,"This thing heats up in a second, and real hot too. We use it for shrinkwrapping bottles. Its working great so far, we've had it for a month now"
5,Some LIke It Hot!,"Wow! This Milwaukee Dual Temperature Heat Gun is powerful! I sometimes have to deal with frozen water pipes at our cabin and thawing them with this gun will be a heck of a lot quicker than using my wife's hair dryer! Especially, since I just had to buy her a'Hot Tools Professional Hair Dryer'as a replacement for the one I (uh -oops!) burned out. My advice - don't mess around with something not meant for the task at hand, if you need a heat gun this one will serve you well. It's not only a 'hot bargain', using it can also keep you from 'taking any unnecessary heat'! ~ The Boss"
3,Did not like it,"This is a decent heat gun but I did not like the bottom of the handle with that rotating stand and the two plastic bumps that support it. Somehow they were got in the way when I hold the gun. It went back to Amazon and instead I got a Hakko HJ5000. Some of its parts are identical to the Milwaukee 8975 and it is also made in Romania, probably by the same factory. The Hakko is quiet, has nice flow of air, can stand vertically without that rotating stand and has longer useable handle length. It is also less expensive but this was not a major consideration."
5,heat gun,product- very good brand of product for general and industrial use. five starsshipping and delivery-very good packaging and very decent delivery. five stars
1,Milwaukee 8975-6 Heat Gun,"I have ordered 3 of these Heat guns from Amazon, and all 3 were used and 1 was damaged. Buyer beware or purchase somewhere else. I called Milwaukee and their customer service was fantastic (no shock there), and took care of the problem right away. It's unfortunate that Amazon accepts returns and then just send's them back out before really checking for damage / use."
2,Didn't work for me,"I guess it wasn't powerful enough to remove paint from my deck. Also, the cord is REALLY short and the ""stand"" doesn't do anything - the gun falls over anyway. I returned mine."
1,won't work with Mac OS 10.4.2,"This scanner will not work with my new Mac (G4, running Tiger 10.4.2). This failure is after numerous contacts with their tech support and repeated downloads of drivers, but for some reason it will not load the ""scanner finder"" - obviously a critical component. I have given up and will upgrade, probably to a Canon, but what a waste of what SHOULD be a still-functional item."
1,"Plug and ""Play""?","I have a brand new, brand name computer. The drivers with the scanner were not Mirosoft approved and the OCR engine would not load.It was really tough to get it going. I downloaded the latest drivers-no help. It began double scanning images, images were poor. It had a preview light for slides which stayed on causing me to end up with pure white scans. I tried really hard to like it but ended up returning it."
1,Let me save you the trouble.,"I wanted to like this scanner. I really did. The most exciting feature and the main reason I chose this scanner was the 4""x5"" slide/transparency scanning area. Finally, a scanner that I could capture my 120 shots on! Much to my dismay, the scans were nothing short of horrid. The scans were littered with red pixels (in a moire noise pattern)! They were also INCREDIBLY blurry. Things got worse the more I tried to make it work. The scanner began to scan far off center from my selection. Eventually, it wouldn't scan ANY of the selection, just the white background.I understand that I obviously had a defective scanner, but the initial scans were totally unacceptable. I bought this scanner for 120 film and to save myself a few dollars. I took this scanner back and got a scanner manufactured by a much more recognizable name in the photo industry."
5,5900 Scanner is GREAT!,I just bought the 5900 model and wanted it because I have tons of old larger format negitives and did not want to spend a fortune on a scanner. It has a very high DPI and yet I have not had to go above 500 DPI for great results. I was worried about slides and 35mm negitives but the 5900 brought them right out with great results. The software is very basic but just what you might need or it can be switched for the advanced but I have kept mine in the basic for ease of use.Replacing my old 1.0 USB card with a new 2.0 makes this baby fly I am more than satisfied with the 5900.
5,Cedarmont Kids: Silly Songs,"No problems with delivery, quick and I'm very happy with the product. My granddaughter loves it."
4,not quite what i expected,"the music content IS what i expected. her music was familiar and enjoyable. what i am disappointed with is that the sound mix in unchanged from the record. (i listened to it many, many times) it was created in the era of LP's and radio. this CD was not re-mixed for this era. the sound quality is a bit flat. i was hoping that someone had taken the time to take the sound that is (i would hope) available in the source tracks and make a CD that really shows off what nicollete is capable of in todays recording/listening standards."
3,Round 2 for Baby D!!!,"Baby D drops his second album called "" Lil Chopper Toy"" and he is still on Big Oomp Records, he did sign a multimillion dollar deal with epic threw his successful "" Off Da Chain"" album. Baby D is still flaunting crunk music again and its no different from his debut. His voice has changed a lil bit but you still get overloaded guest apperances by some no namers and Baby D barely spits a verse. This is very dissapointing because BAby D needs to shine not the Oomp Camp or Pastor Troy. If Baby D goes commerical he'll need that indepenantness because no one is gonna know his distinct style and flow with 5 people rapping on a track. He really has showed us that he is gonna blow up from the units he sells and his popularity. But if this is your thang then add this to your collection."
1,Waste of Money,"My 2.1 mega pixel phone camera produces better pics than this. I have yet to have a decent pic from this camera. Everything pic I have take is either dark or blurred. If you want to use it as a a web cam it does a decent job. I have regretted buying this crap, that I just packed it in a corner. The videos are just as poor or even worst.To create a product of such poor quality at that price, is nothing short of greed.If you opt to buy after my warning then you deserve what you get."
1,not worth the money,"I paid 99.00 for this little camcorder, thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house, but we couldn't get the videos to transfer to the pc. The menu button would not bring anything up, so overall we just couldn't get this thing to work. A bummer of a christmas present."
3,DXG-506 Review,"This digital camera works well in general, but do your research before you buy one. I have found in bright sunlight, that the image is very blurry. I have also found that zooming the camera in all the way causes a lot more blurry pixels then thought. The image becomes very distorted. All in all I think the camera is good but I am sure their are some new products out on the market now that gets the job done better. If your looking for a cheap digital camcorder, then buy one of these."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this camera with the belief that it was a good purchase I am very disappointed with the quality of the photos taken at night there seems to be no flash built in, hence the quality of the photos taken at night, I intend to keep the camera for my six year old son to use and I will purchase another one - with the benefit of reviews this time."
1,Defective product,"The product arrived defective, it never worked. Most frustrating was the company who sold it to me through Amazon: Antonline. Terrible service! It took me forever get authorization to return the product, then they credited me the wrong amount, and Amazon took forever to correct the mistake. I am wary now of buying electonics online from little known companies."
2,"total darkness in low light, bad audio","total darkness in low light, i didn't belive other people when they told me this was bad for low-light, but they are right. very bad audio quality, too. easy operation, though, controls are well positioned."
1,Sold under flase pretense and did not work,"I received my item today. It was PINK instead of silver as indicated. The batteries were all corroded and nasty, one battery slot is crusty and rusted. It did NOT include any of the things it was suppsed to. There was black dirty case and that it is. Below is what the item was supposed to come with and it was supposed to be SILVER.""Includes 32MB internal memory, 4 AAA alkaline batteries, earphones, USB and AV cables, pouch, wrist strap and software""AND to top it all off.... I bought batteries and the camera DOESNT WORK! the screen powers on but DOES NOT WORK!!!!"
2,bad delived service,I haven't got my damn camera so I am out of time if I don't get my stuff I be going somewhere else to buy my stuff got that personP.S. don't forget stir I'm really up setFrom: sweetcakes
2,"Cheap, but still not worth it","I just got this camera yesterday and so far, its simply ""OK"". I'm a bit disappointed to tell the truth. The flash serves absolutely no purpose not to mention its akward placement; your hand almost always covers it when taking pictures.The pictures comes out dark with or without the flash so the camere is best used in daylight..ONLY, so forget about capturing any night time activity with this camera. The pictures seem blurry and the differnt quality choices seem not to make a difference. The video isn't bad though not enough memory to record much. The memory card slot keeps popping open, but thats the least.The manualis useless. The MP3 player isn't bad either, i'll probably use it more than anything else on this camera, but the problem of memory arises again as the camera doesn't come with any external memory i.e memory card,this has to be purchased separately. Wish I had known this before. My suggestion? Anyone considering buying this camera...DON'T."
4,Decent little camcorder...,"This is the first camcorder I've ever owned. So far I like it. It's easy to use, the picture quality is pretty good and the movie quality is just as good...although at night or in dark indoors it comes out a tad grainy. The mp3 portion has frozen on me twice but only because of the song itself (I never checked what made those songs different from the rest I had loaded so I have no idea why they caused the freeze.)but other then that I am really happy with my purchase.Others have complained that the battery cover and lens cap fall off easily or break. I've not had the problem at all...as a matter of fact I find the lens cap fits to tight and sometimes is difficult to get snapped on completely. The battery cover does fit loosely but securely and has never fallen off on it's own accord. I think as long as you actually read the direction manual before you run out the door with your new toy you'll find it works just as they say it does."
2,had to return it,"the camcorder i bought for a birthday present did not work,i had to return it. when it did work the webcam is un-useable,it's too, too dark. i still haven't gotten the replacement. the rest of the functions are pretty good, next time i'll spend more money."
1,"DXG ""Customer Care"" is a joke","I reciever a camcorder from DXG. Upon opening the box, I found that the CD driver application software was missing. This CD was the main reason for ordering the camcorder. I tried calling their ""Costomer Care"" so I can get a replace CD. I wasted 20 minutes trying to call tech support at first then the Operator, to no avail. Their ""promise"" of:At DXG USA, we stand by our products. If, for any reasons, you have questions or need assistance with your DXG products, we're always here to help you. That's our promise.What a load of crap! I will not buy another item from this company. You are foolish if you do."
2,$100 is way too much,"At this point in time the 506V is older and not worth $100. As with all the previous posts the video camera works fine for kids and non important things, if you don't have any problems and can get it cheaper. I purchased a brand new one just recently from a local store for $50 and that was a little too much for what I got. When recording video you can't hear any one very well except your own voice. You have to be right in someones face to hear them. I purchased it to replace my old Canon point and shoot, bad sensor, and ironically it still does better with sound. The positive side is the video is super nice and working with MPEG4 is cool. Otherwise cameras that cost $100 or at $150 are way better. Do your research...which by reading this you are. If you can go out and test some in the store to get a better idea of what you're getting."
5,CAPD,"I live in Canada and was amazed to see the book arrive just the next day, the perfect timing at the start my course. I am very impressed with the website and transactions by Amazon.com"
4,Flora & George Duke weave Brazilian magic together,"In 1979, George Duke took a break from his funky R&B successes to produce this Brazilian-jazz fusion record for Flora Purim. The result is one of Flora's best albums. Milton Nascimento's ""From the Lonely Afternoon"" is a highlight, given a more intense, upbeat interpretation here than the version he recorded with Wayne Shorter on ""Native Dancer"". Duke's original contribution, ""Carry On"", displays his polished R&B techniques, seasoned with a heavy dash of Brazilian spice. Max Middleton's ""Freeway Jam"", a Jeff Beck Group hit, is another highlight, with Flora's voice replacing Beck's guitar as the primary melody instrument."
4,For this price who can complain?,"For my purposes, (ie: home use without attracting the cops); this speaker system works just fine. I could complain about the way the subwoofer doesn't take a direct subwoofer line -but who cares? This is a decent product for a fraction of the competetor's prices."
4,strong film making,The director of Flight 93 shows his talent is no fluke with this mesmerizing retelling of this horrific peace march.
5,Bloody Sunday,"Bloody Sunday is a well filmed show that brings to light of one of the most tragic events in Irish history. On a peaceful cival rights march, the British first opened fire on the Irish march, and were given permission to fire at will. Any one who is Irish, and knows exactly what happened on that faitful day, can now get an up close and real feel of what it was like to face the British para's, while peacfully marching for equal rights, in a land whose boundries were gerrymandered by the British. The movie is very acurate, showing that the British first shot on the defensless Irish. Years later the British government investigated the events of that day, called the Stalker Report. Once the investigation was finished, the British refused to release the results of that investigation. This movie, is not one sided. It accurately portrays the events of that day, showing that the Irish were repressed of their due rights, by an invading, colonial government."
3,Paul Greengrass,"I'm working backwards through Director Paul Greengrass' body of work starting with ""United 93"" then ""The Bourne Supremacy."" I never heard of ""Bloody Sunday"" the movie or the event, which happened when I was a young adult.I can see why Paul Greengrass was chosen to direct ""United 93"" because of ""Bloody Sunday,"" as Director Greengrass said in the bonus material on ""United 93.""In ""Bloody Sunday"" Director Greengrass is recounting an horrific event. All is done in hand held letting us be right next to the charactor.The only thing missing in ""Bloody Sunday"" is the big budget like Director Greengrass' following works:United 93 (Widescreen Edition)The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)"
2,Bloody sunday,"Not really up to my expectation and I'm not impressed, there was no historical background on the Bloody Sunday, mainaction in the movie were streetfightings, killings etc. Would not recommend."
2,Bloody Sunday,"I was dissapointed with this film, I bought it hoping to watch a very powerful movie about a piece of Irish history worth noting."
5,Git yer gun!,"This is a great tool. It doesn't have the temp gauge like the fancier version, but you can sneak up on the right temp by observation pretty well. It gets HOT! I do wish it had a little protruding stand on one side as part of the case or something, so you could lay it on it's side. You can stand it on the fan end with the wire bracket at the end of the handle, but it tends to fall over with the smallest bump. I will probably rig something up so I can lay it on the side. I like the attachments and the case and the tool is rock solid with a heavy cord. You get what you pay for on this kind of tool."
5,"A great Heat Gun, with the case and attachments... what a sweet deal!!!","When it comes to high quality Heat Guns, this kit is one of the few out there, yet one of the best. I have used it for several projects from small to big jobs and this heat gun has been able to handle them all without any trouble, the temperature control is a plus specially when you need to do very delicate work.I will buy me another one in the blink of an eye. If you are looking for a good quality multi-purpose heat gun this is the way to go.I have no negative comments on this product, it has past several tests with honors!!! A+++"
4,Needs More Airflow (CFM),I purchased this heat gun for my husband for Christmas. He really likes it except he says that it needs more airflow (CFM).
3,Leatherman Kick Removeable Pocket Clip,"The pocket clip for the Kick does what it's designed to do, but it does have side to side play in it. There's a small tab that keeps the clip in place, but mine has about a 1/4"" of play even when tightened down all the way. The screw that comes with the clip isn't actually making tight enough contact to make the clip hold firmly in place. And because the clip is positioned at the bottom of the handles, when it's clipped to a pocket, it may let the tool open up in your pocket. It's still an 'ok' clip for those that don't want to wear a belt and use the sheath."
4,Makes it better,"I've had my Kick for a couple of years, but never liked wearing the sheath. After cruising around Amazon, I happened upon this. For the price, I thought I couldn't go wrong. Received in a timely manner. As others have stated, it was a little loose. With the right washer, I got it on perfectly. Stays in my pocket no problem."
3,it's always the little guys...,"My brother bought this cd and at first I thought it was yet another band with a singer who's screaming voice never changes throughout the disk. But i took another listen and paid attnetion to the way the guys actually play and i changed my mind entirely. Amazing changes in level and really great sounding riffs make you sorta look past the fact his screaming voice is completely monotonous. I give it a three because of that fact, and because there are a few occasions where they drag the cool riffs i mentioned out for long periods of time. All in all, if you can listen to a cd and appreciate the way the band actually plays, you'll like these kids. Plus it'll rock you out fairly well. I like it."
2,Another bad charger,"I have owned my PC 14.4 1/2"" hammer drill for nearly two years - while I do tote my drill around a fair bit, the charger has mostly lived on a shelf in the basement. With no inkling of a problem, it just quit. The drill is great, the batteries are above average, and the charger just plain stinks. (My DeWalt 12 volt of six years has gone through two pairs of batteries - and the charger keeps working.) Perhaps the ""diagnotic"" feature on this charger is a little too fragile."
3,Great Drill - Poor Charger,Like the other reviews - the drill works flawlessly and has more than enough torque. Problem is the charger quit working about 2 years of home use. That's pretty poor for sitting on the garage work bench.
2,Porter - Cable Drill Set,Porter - Cable 19 Volt drill set is a great value. I have used Porter - Cable tools for years. They perform well and hold up and everyday use.I recomend these tools to all my friends. This 19 volt set looks to be a wonderfull addition to my collection to tools.
4,"Leona, X Factor winner, British version of American Idol","She's a gorgeous girl, but her demeanor is just darling... she's very humble and soft spoken, but boy can she belt out a song! All three judges praised her, and Simon said that finally Britain has a girl singer as good as Whitney, Mariah or Christina., and that she is the best contestant he has ever had on any of the shows! Wow, from him that's remarkable. I prefer her voice over all of their voices, so look for LEONA. Simon said she's going to be a worldwide star & Louis agreed. I was a little disappointed that her first CD single is ""A moment like this,"" seems like they could have come up with something more original, but I like her a lot more than Kelly Clarkson. She's very sweet and humble."
4,An excellent Sourcebook in the Art of Auric Healing,"This book is a must for anyone interested in laying on hands and in understanding the human energy field in general. Barbara Brennan gives substantial background information concerning the disease process and how disturbances and imbalances in the aura manifest in the physical body. She then gives in-depth techniques for correcting these problems on a holistic level, including lucid examples of the ongoing process of healing.My only complaint about this book is that it fails to address the highly subjective nature of higher perception, but those who are aware of auras should be able to relate her way of seeing with their own.Although it may not be the best introduction for the beginning healer, overall, this book is an excellent addition to the shelves of intermediate to advanced healers, and it will serve them for years as their practice of the healing arts continues."
5,Incredible Healing Book.,I read this book first as a Doctorate Student. It disappeared on a move. I was devastated because it had become my encyclopedia for healing. Amazing book!! It gave me additonal insight into alternative healing. I learned the most basic yet prophetic lessons on human existence and made so many notes and studied observations in this book. This book has had the most profound impact on my thought patterns as a Doctor (much more so than any required school text). I have spent my years studying human healing. It dosen't stop at any certain persons defintion of healing. I find each unique human has some new meaning to add to this process. This book will start you on your way to understanding and loving all of man kind.
3,Well written but the ending scared me,The author writes like she knows what she is talking about. However I was a bit disturbed by her worshiping her spiritual guide in the last chapter. But if you are into that sort of stuff its great.
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE SMITH/MOODY BOOK,"Although I congratulate her on raising awareness in this field, there is just too much that needs to be taken on faith in this book. I still don't get any technique that allows me to actually see an aura. The exercises laid out in the book ""Auras-See Them In 60 Seconds"" actually work, even if the title is a little hokey. Once you get past Mr. Smith's autobiographical style, the kernal of truth in what he is saying is very satisfying. With the Brennan book, I'm left feeling a little left out."
4,A Seminal Work on Energy Healing,"This is one of the best respected books in the field of energy healing. An oversized volume, it is absolutely packed with information. In fact, that may be the only drawback for those who are new to energy healing, as the amount of technical information is almost ovewhelming. But Brennan has filled the book with so much more than the usual basic information on chakras, the aura, etc. that even those who do not wish to delve so deeply into this art will find extremely useful information.- Nicole Wilde, author Energy Healing for Dogs: Using Hands-On Healing to Improve Canine Health and Behavior"
5,Excelent discourse on energetic work,"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the energy systems and the human aura. I've yet to come across anything as in depth as this work on the anatomy of the human energy field and it's workings as well as their relation to our every day lives, physically, mentally, spiritually, and psychologically.Working with the energy fields is a long involved process of learning, but even so this book has been a wonderful aid in my journey. It's interesting to read a more western perspective as well thought out and presented as the material within these pages, as I traditionally come from a more eastern background when it comes to the energy sciences. The information presented here goes well in tandem with that knowledge, and makes this a work worth reading."
5,life changing,"I didnt realize this at the time, but ""hands of light"" is actually a text book to the brennan healing science. the scope of this healing modality is amazing -- i've been learning about all sort of healing modalities for years, and bhs is one of the most comprehensive i've come across. it's not only about working with energy and the aura, but also delves into the deeper beliefs that cause imbalance and eventually illness. it covers many practical elements and exercises that have been helpful to me in terms of quieting my mind and getting energy flowing. barbara shares words from her personal guide, and acknowledges the role of guides, angels, and god in healing. there's a ton of specific info in this book, and i found it very helpful and inspiring."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. Here is one example of my disappointment: Brennen describes the ""universal energy field"", and claims that through her high-sensory perception she can see ""orgone"". But her description of orgone (little tranlucent globules that come down from the sky) sounds a lot like the little bits of crap that float in the liquid on your eye. (You normally don't see the crap floating on your eye because your brain, quite rightly, ignores them). So, either her great ability to observe ('high-sensory perception') is just really poor observation or she doesn't adequately describe what she is observing. Either way, the book is misleading.I suspect what Brennen is actually observing through her 'high-sensory perception' is really optical illusions."
1,Watch out for these quacks! Go see a real doctor....,"This book is total hogwash. Non of the claims in here have any thorough ground. There is no evidence for the presence of auras or human energy fields, let alone that they could be manipulated. All there is are claims by Ms. Brennan, which cannot be validated in any way.The book did give me a few laughs though, although it's sad that people who actually need medicinal care believe this nonsense. People who feel they suffer anything should better see a real doctor instead of getting involved with quacks like Brennan."
3,Be Careful - The Author is Too Impressed with Herself,"This book excited me with its many illustrations, but after reading the preface and the beginning, I was turned off. The author makes a claim that only someone with her background can do what she does. Ridiculous. We all come from different backgrounds so who is say what any one of us can or cannot do?Red flags go up when I hear claims like that; to me, they speak only of closed-mindedness. Consequently, I take the other information presented with a huge grain of salt. I'm not interested in somebody's ego stroking. I'm seeking spiritual growth. Anyone who claims that they know the one and only route to something is deluding themselves. The Universe has many paths and we are all traveling the path that is uniquely ours. Good luck on your journeys."
2,Cautions,"Although this would be a wonderful book for anyone who wants to heal who can already see energy and auras..There are still plenty of us who can't, and the author makes no adjustments for us visually stunted folk who can't see colors, but can feel general states. Nor does she really give us any guidence to ""see"" energy better. A lot of wonderful looking knowledge that I could not use. I gave the book to a friend who can see colors."
4,A real eye opener.,"Learn how your aura and chakras work. And how they effect not only your physical self, but also your ability to love and grow as a human both mentally and spiritually. I am wary though of some of the new-agey stuff."
5,My favorite energy book of all time!,"For anyone interested in learning about energy work or deepinging their energy practice, this is the book for you. Barbara Brennan does a wonderful job of describing energy, its place throughout history, gives exercises/homework and illustrations."
5,"Hands of Light, an enlightening view of energy and how to use it","I have owned a copy of this excellent book for many years and have enjoyed it very much. This more recent purchase was for my aunt, who read my book in which I referenced Ms Brennan's work. It is easy to read, yet gives a satisfying depth of treatment on the many aspects of energy and the forces which affect it, and how to use it."
5,Wonderfully Written,I truly enjoyed reading this book. It is well written and informative. Many thanks to Barbara Ann Brennan for sharing this information with the world!
1,Defective pitched CD,"This CD is defective product.I have the LP version of this wonderful performance of Ms. King and Ms. McPartland and loved the wonderful commitment of two ladies to each song.But when I started to play this CD version, something is wrong, really wrong!The pich of each number is SEMI-TONE AND QUARTER LOWER.It means that her voice quality is greatly dameged (especially, the sweetness and clarity in her voice and became different person's voice.Also, tempo of each song is slower than in original key performance and it makes them dull atmosphere. IN CORRECT PITCH, this show is more warm and exciting.If you have a pitch controlled CD player, I really recommend this CD but don't touch it if you don't have, because you cannot appreciate these superb performance with this CD.Do not judge Teddi King by this CD. She is much much better!!!"
4,CHECK YOUR BITS!!,"I received this and found that I did not have the complete set. One bit was missing, and I was doubled up on another. Bits were out of sequence, and the holder can easily get stretched by larger bits, making it difficult to hold smaller ones when put in a logical order.I contacted Leatherman, and they sent me the missing bit without question. Check it when it arrives.Otherwise, good kit. Sheath easily holds the bit extension as well.I also own theLeatherman 830039 New Wave Multitool with Leather/Nylon Combination Sheath. With some coaxing both bit holders can fit into the nylon holder for the wave along with the bit extension. It makes a tighter fit for the Wave, but not unmanageable."
5,Now your Leatherman can do almost anything!,"This packet of tools enables your Leatherman to do almost anything! I have the Leatherman Wave...I take it camping and bicycling with me, because of it's great ""fix it"" capability! With the 42 bit assortment, I have a lot of tools with me without taking up a lot of space, in the event I need them. This Leatherman bit assortment is well worth having!"
3,Nice but not quite there yet.,"I got this kit to go with my Wave. I was excited at the idea of carrying a toolbox worth of drivers in my belt. I was disappointed when the kit arrived however. What is not made clear is that the bits are flat and not full size. In other words, imagine going to the hardware store and getting a #2 Phillips bit for your drill or electric screwdriver. Now, imagine taking that bit and running it through a surface planer until you are left with the middle third of that bit. That is what you have here. It should be fine for the flat head screws but I worry that you would strip a large Allen or Torx screw. Still, it is an innovative way of fitting a loot of bits into a small area."
2,Haven't gotten an opportunity to use this yet,"The screwdriver pieces that come with the Leatherman Tool itself get a lot of use, but this extra kit... I have not been able to find a use for it at all. I bought the Skeletool, which has a removeable belt clip on the side. The bit needed to remove and reattach/tighten the removable belt clip's attachment screw doesn't even come with this expanded set, so what good is a removeable belt clip if you can't even put it back on properly or keep it on tight using the tools they give you? Spend your money on something more useful."
2,Does not fit the 'old' WAVE,"I was unimpressed with the two nylon carriers the bits sit in, and the bits themselves are kind of flattenedLeatherman introduced a new model of the Wave with a builtin tool adapter rather than giving a new tool a new name, with the result that I received this as a gift that I cannot use.minuses for the bad product description, the cheapness of the carrier, and the terrible Amazon customer service over this."
4,A complement to the Wave,"I bought a Leatherman Wave back in December and was pleasantly surprised to see it used a removable bit for the screwdrivers. What was even better was to find that there was an expansion bit set to go with it. The retail price seemed a bit high, but after a little searching I was able to find a good price. I work with computers, and this has been a real help. Instead of carrying a full-sized multi-bit screwdriver, I have a compact Wave and my bit set. I've arranged the bits so that the ones I'd most likely need are in one holder, which is stored in my Wave case. A very nice addition."
3,Solid product,A very good product that has come in useful but it's a bear to carry around and difficult to get bits out sometimes.
4,Bits and pieces...,"I've been wanting to buy this item for years. I used to own my own handyman business, so I've worked with literally thousands of different tools. This is a great advanced bit-kit to augment your Leatherman. It has all the common size screwdriver bits and loads of uncommon ones. I'm the 'go to' guy when something breaks and this is a great emergency 'go-to' kit in a real pinch. Good tool steel, locks into the brace well and you can use your Leatherman as an ""L"" handle to get better leverage. I don't care for the ballistic nylon case. It doesn't even have a pocket in the back of it to separate the bits from the tool. I prefer the leather case. But all in all this bit-kit is well worth the money."
5,"Quality, Variety","This is a good example of ""several that I may never need, but some day I'll be glad I have them"". Arrived on time, product as advertised. Very satisfied."
4,Great addition,This add on to the leatherman is PERFECT.The ONLY problem is that the bits need to come in a different holder.They can be a little tough to handle.BUT..overall two thumbs up!!
4,Irony of Ironies,"I love my Skeletool and my Bit Assortment. HOWEVER, ironically enough, the kit does not include a bit that allows you to remove the clip off of your Skeletool."
4,Every little bit helps,"Amazing how many ""little things"" need adjustment in life. This definitely helps, it keeps all of the ""adjusters"" immediately available instead of ""where are my's"""
5,Neat idea,"What a great idea from Leatherman! I keep these on me in a nylon Wave case with a Skeletool and they are really nice to have around. It's a bit heavier setup than I'm used to, but I like the idea of having many bits at my disposal. I recommend for folks who need access to lots of different tools throughout the day or just to keep around in the car or RV as an emergency kit.PS - my strips came in black not clear/white as shown on Amazon. Personally I prefer the black."
5,Just what the Doctor ordered...,"I am a security guard, home fix-it guruess and hobbist computer builder. Let me tell you, this bit-kit is the perfect match to go with my Charge ALX.While I'm working, I can have the wide flat- and Phillips-bits locked onto the tool just in case I need to open up a piece of equipment -- a fairly common occourance, really.Then, when I get home and have to repair a appliance or door lock, I switch to the appropriate bit there.Then finally, when repairing/upgrading a desktop or laptop, I don't have to search too hard for the appropriate bit to pop open a case or mount a new motherboard.All-in-all, a real heaven-sent accessory."
4,Useful in a pinch,"I bought these for my leatherman a few years ago, and now I wear them everywhere I go. I find that I don't often need much more than a phillips or a flathead, but when I do need some exotic bit, I usually find it in here. They are quite sturdy and have stood some abuse."
5,very handy to have for work/life,"having this tool saved me from having to go out to the van and get an allen wrench, to take a pilot bit out of a hole saw. not only handy a time saver. this just one example"
4,A mindtrip!,"In writing ""22 Stories,"" David Lawrence undertook the very daunting task of constructing a story in which the theme of each chapter (22 in all) deals with one of the 22 cards of the Major Arcana of a tarot deck. Furthermore, each chapter takes place on a separate story within a 22-story building. Not an easy task, but one that Lawrence pulled off outstandingly.Set in the not-too-distant future, ""22 Stories"" follows Phillip and Emily as they try to uncover what happened to them during an experiment while working at Virtual Design. Along the way, we (the reader) take a journey through the annals of Science Fiction, Suspense, Religion, Spirituality, Sensuality, Philosophy, and New Age Mysticism. Split into three sections, each dealing with a separate facet of existence, ""22 Stories"" will shake your mind from out of its slumber. Definitely worth the price of admission."
4,scalemaster,This tool is versatile and easy to use. It's time savings really show up when working with various scaled drawings.
2,The snaps themselves break.,"1. You can slide this over your belt if you have a VERY THIN belt and not have to mess with the snaps.2. if you have a thicker belt, you have to unsnap the snaps (top of image). As someone else mentioned, these are EXCEEDINGLY difficult to unsnap. I've been using my clip for about two months. Yesterday, when I was unsnapping it (herculean effort to do that by the way) one of the snaps themselves broke. Now I have only one functional snap. The other one broke by separating the steel round cover part of the snap away from the inner/inside portion - so it isn't fixable.Because this isn't an expensive item to begin with, it isn't worth the time/trouble/money to return it. I was basically happy with this product until the snap broke. Beware."
1,"Amazon info is unclear, snaps are poor","Despite the fact that the Amazon description specifically says ""Fits up to 65mm belts"", this is not true. You need a different (larger) clip which is listed elsewhere. Now I know. As it is, this is useless to me and it is not worth the cost of shipping to return it. Also, the snaps provide a death grip and have to be pried apart with a screwdriver, yet the rivets which hold them on are too flimsy and won't last."
4,Krusell always great,"Kruusell always make great items, but it is getting harder to find cases to take advantage of the great products available via the multidapt line."
4,highly readable and inspiring,"I had an opinion that a Dick Enberg autobiography would be dull simply because of his painfully diplomatic approach to life. Where would be the juicy, behind the scenes stories? Mr. Enberg shows that selective story telling and evenhandedness can be very readable AND interesting. What comes across is a life of dedication, hard work and a love of sports, recognizing that are multiple sides to a sports story.The comment by one reviewer that he is the worst announcer ever, while it doesn't address the quality of the book, is simply incorrect. One only needs to mute the TV while watching his broadcasts and observe the poetic flow of his delivery while his booth-mates, many of whom are excellent, stutter and stray from the game. There are some personal lessons in the book and much appreciation to be gained from what it takes to produce a quality sportscast."
3,Suprisingly good,"As a Martial artist for over a decade now i was suprised to read a book that wasn't just an advertisment for somebodys school. He puts forward interesting theories and lets you decide to take away what if anything you wish .Ps begginers in martial arts should never, never, try to larn from books its just bad news trust me, unlearning is ten times harder than learning get out there and do some research and find a good techer."
5,very considerate,warm and glowing. douglas purdon is quite a gentlemen and invites you into his world of color pools which i found fasinating. a great experience a very good book
4,Blues,"A good disc. Lee's voice reminds me of James Brown, and the band sounds like the JBs on occasion. I'd rate this a 3.5-4 compared against Lee's 'My World.'"
4,Quite good!,This movie was much better than I thought it would be. Marilyn did a great job as a nearly insane baby sitter... I am really glad i watched it!!!
3,2 worthwhile,"The two dramas Dont bother to knock and Niagara are amongst Marilyns best. She is very touching and stunning with dark hair as the pyscho baby sitter in Dont bother. Monkey bizness is an unfunny comedy with Marilyn, in a small role providing the only worthwhile moments. Lets make love and river of no Return are both stinkers, but Marilyn looks her most gorgeous in both. Buy at your own risk."
3,knock !,only about an hour long but a great vehicle for marilyn monroe as the crazed/delusional baby sitter.Check it out.
3,Marilyn's first big part,"A young woman recently released from a mental institution (Marilyn Monroe) slips back into madness in the New York hotel where her uncle (Elisha Cook, Jr.) has found a babysitting job for her. This is an interesting little thriller, but not memorable enough to have survived the test of time had it not featured Monroe's first starring role. Although she is quite good, her part is underdeveloped. We really learn nothing about how she came to be as she is, and her illness is the stereotypical pathology of slipping into the past and pining for a lost love. A few scenes in which a child is endangered provoke some real suspense, and I can't help but wonder how it played for 50s audiences. Good viewing, but it fails to transcend its B-movie status./"
4,Great for Marilyn Fans!!!,You can't go wrong if you're a big Marilyn Monroe fan! The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I wish one of her lesser known movies was replaced with The Misfits - a Marilyn classic that all fans should own!
5,Milwaukee 8980 Dual temp heat gun kit,"I am very impressed with this heat gun, I have only had it a few weeks and I have already used it to free rusted nuts on an old van, speed up sheet rock ""mud"" drying. Gotta go slow here or it will crack! And most recently, I used it to strip the paint off of door trim. It easily removed about 5 layers of paint.My only minor complaint with the kit is removing the ""diffusers"" after use. The most difficult one to remove was the widest diffuser, I discovered that careful spreading with a screwdriver was all that was needed to get it off. Not enough of a bother to lower my review."
5,Milwaukee 8980 Heat gun kit,"This kit contains everything I needed. I have used to speed up the drying process of epoxy, and to heat shrink splices. What can you say it's Milwaukee! It arrived on time and works great."
4,Cutting board,"The board provided appears to be well crafted -- clean, square, stable, and adequately thick, with nicely routed drain grooves. The price was fair. The ""sustainable"" claim for the hardwood was gratifying. I prefer hardwood over other material such as bamboo. It is not highly finished like a piece of furniture, but perfect for the application. I would definitely make the purchase again."
3,"Pleasant Read, Little Intrigue","This is a pleasant read. I enjoyed the village of Turnham Malpas [Rebecca Shaw has written several novels in this setting, apparently a series]. The author has created living characters, about whom you care and about whom you enjoy reading. The novel reminds me a little of Jan Karon's novels about Mitford, without the religious underpinning.The first half of the book is very good and has all the ingredients needed for a good yarn. But things just peter out."
1,Hard to Read,"Quite simply, this caller ID display is too hard to read from any angle EVEN if it has brand new batteries in it, AND the contrast is turned up all the way. The display is just too dim. Save your money and don't buy this one."
3,HOW DO YOU RESET THE LANGUAGE OPTION?,"I bought several of these since they were inexpensive, although they EAT batteries. Unfortunately, I didn't keep the instructions for setting the language (which you must re-do after changing the batteries). Can anyone out there help me with this? Thanks!"
2,low quantity hard to read LCD,Dos the job as basic Caller ID if for some mysterious raisons you don't have a phone with one but it's low quantity hard to read LCD.
4,Great product for the price,"Was somewhat hesitant to purchase this product after reading a couple negative reviews on the display, but after receiving and using this product I am quite pleased with it considering the low price I paid.Easy to use, which was one of my criteria. There is little to fault the display. . . . it is reasonably readable if the unit is not positioned at too much an angle for viewing. I have no regrets."
4,Personnel,"Michael Brooks GuitarTommy Caradonna Bass (ex Alice Cooper,White Lion )Frankie Hanyak DrumsE. Keith Jackson GuitarBrian Smith VocalsProduced, recorded, & mixed by Gilby Clarke"
5,18 stories culled from 16 years of The Ladder,"Terrific collection - the best of the best.The story `Hope Deferred' by Isabel Miller had me wincing in pain and understanding.Lee Lynch's story `As Dreams Are Made' had me clinching my fist in anger, and her other story `A Hard Row to Hoe' made me want to reach through the pages to her heroine Madeline and tell her that all would be all right.Don't miss Barbara Grier's essay that closes the book `The Lesbian Paperback' which gives you a brief yet illuminating look at the books published in the 1950's through the 1960's - what to get, what was trash and why it was trash. Fascinating.Contibutors includeJane RuleValerie TaylorCarol MoranJocelyn HaywardJane AldenLynn LonidierLynn MichaelsJeanette LeeMelinda BrownGabriele Vivian BertrandDolores KlaichFlicka MooreHelen Rose HullThis is a Keeper!"
1,be cautious,"I would caution any beginner at genealogy in using this book (and nobody but an absolute beginner would have a need). It appears to be biased towards the LDS Church. In one chapter about using church records, the author brags about the LDS Church and one other Protestant Church as being the best churches for keeping records of their members through their history. It fails to mention the Catholic Church and the fact that they have maintined records for hundreds of years. If one has Catholic relatives, as I do, the Catholic Church would be the logical place to look. Had I not already known this, I would have been left uninformed by this book. That is just one example. When one is done reading the book, one has a clear picture of the authors religion and biases. Not really what I was looking for. It is a shame, as the photographs and examples are beautifully done."
2,Missing metal logo plaque,The right part number was sent to me for the sheath but no attractive metal logo plaque as promised. I'm kinda disappointed w/ the sheath as its not the one pictured on the webpage. I don't wannt to inconvenience myself to return the item.
2,Are you sure this is Poe?,"Undiscovered book by favorite author. What could go wrong? Not at all what I expected. Way over my head. Only understood about half of what I read. Had to give up, to preserve fondness for author."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy. Anchor Bay has not improved on the MGM transfer. On a widescreen TV the movie is a thin strip across the middle of the screen and has to be watched through a zoom feature. The original stereo sound has not been restored.It doesn't even have subtitles, like the MGM version.The featurette was made a long time ago and is worthless.False advertising. If you want a good transfer of THEY SHOOT HORSES with real special features, you'll have to wait."
1,boring,"we watched this movie because it is a classic. maybe it would have been different on a big screen, but i was bored. the 'message' of the movie is clear in the first 10 minutes and there are no surprises for the next hour and a half. yes, the system is bad. yes, we see different characters and observe their interactions, but it was rather predictable. the movie is very stagey, theatrical and dated. fonda is beautiful, but that's not enough to rescue it from being tedious."
1,unable to view,I am very disappointed with your service.I am unable to view this dvd as it is not compatible with the australian system.I informed your company by email but received no response.I will not buy from you in the future.
4,A powerhouse,"A powerful movie that breaks your heart witnessing the human suffering that was part of the Great Depression. Gig Young's performance is over the top but one wonders how it could be anything else. Jane Fonda shows she was an actress and not merely a celebrity and Michael Sarazan, whatever happened to him? is a JFK look alike as one of the walking wounded of the depression."
5,Period Piece,"Horace Mcoy,s story comes to life in a stunning film that has it all.Sydney Pollacks dance marathon will leave you totally spent. I,m not a big Jane Fonda fan but in this film she delivers it all. a cynical downtrodden woman who really needs to win something. Sarrazin is perfect as the fall guy for the montage. Ironically, if you read Gig Youngs story..""Final Gig"" you will learn that winning an Oscar for this film did not help him at all.causing ultimate depression and suicide.One of the great film editing jobs you will ever see. Stunning."
4,Devastating !!!!,"Well, if you want to see a movie that has a great cast, a great, harrowing, gripping, story , then this is a DVD for you !! This shows us what the dance marathon's of the depression era 30's were really like. Grueling, barbaric, and heart wrenching. A movie that will blow you away. It will rank as one of the top movies ever to make you feel like bomb was just dropped on you. Get ready for this one, it packs one hell of a wallop !!! Good Luck."
1,Beware Fashion and Time Store,"I just attempted to purchase a watch from the Fashion and Time store, and had an awful experience. The watch was promised for shipping within 11 days, and by day 14 had still not arrived. Finally Amazon sent an Email to me advising that they could not confirm shipment of the product, and I had to contact the Fashion and Time Store to cancel the order. I never received any response to Emails forwarded to the store regarding my order.When all was said and done I was then able to order the same watch (new) from a different provider for about 15% less.I would NOT purchase anything from the Fashion and Time Store again.- Mark Bosscher"
4,Nice iron with a few minor problems,"Nice iron for the price. Made in France. Quality comparable to Rowenta. Large non-stick soleplate. Heats up quickly. Water fills and empties from the bottom. This means you have to disengage the unit and flip it over in order to fill it. The base is heavy and sturdy which prevents tip over, but the power cord unfortunately can easily get hung on the corner of the base during use."
5,T-Tal iron,"Brilliant! I recently moved to the US from England, and my iron there was a T-Fal. I tried another make and it died far too soon. I was actually using the converter along with my English iron, and decided to try to find something I could use without a converter. I was absoluely delighted when I found the T-Fal. I love the bottom; it glides over everything. I love the way the water fills. It really is a wonderful iron."
2,Keep looking...,"On the highest setting this iron is barely hot enough to iron cotton! Also, once water has been added to the reservoir, it leaks and spits (often dark colored, staining) water unpredictably. It seems this iron has been discontinued, and this is good."
4,Great press!,"Solid iron that works great. For some reason they switched the spray/steam buttons from prior models, but everything else is good."
5,Very good iron,This is a great iron. I iron a lot and have used many irons over the years. This is the best yet. I have no complaints.
3,Great iron,"Everything about this iron is great except the auto-off function. There is no on or off switch hence upon pluggin the iron it should automatically comes on... however it doesn't do that and so i have I thought it was just a glitch so i was watching this and it got worse it wouldn't come on most times, and i have to be playing with the iron/ heat settings for it to come on. I called amazon but they told me its past 30 days so i must check with manufacture for warranty. This was a prob i called gave the iron model and was given a facility to ship iron for repair or exchange. I am awaiting its returm."
4,An extraordinary book!,"This book describes how to tabulate knots with the help of computers. You could ask, so, what is special about that and why is this difficult? It is difficult because a knot or link is a topological object and hence, it is not clear how to represent such an object that it can be processed by an computer at all. Even if you know the Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation it is still an art to do it.In my opinion this book is ahead of its time, because the field of computational topology/knot theory is still in its infacncy."
1,Rubbish,I've purchased two different cases for my Leatherman Wave and both broke in the same place. The webbed belt loop will break within a month of use dont buy this product look for a leather case instead.
1,Knife fell out and got lost,I got this for my leatherman Wave knife because the leather case was destroyed by a dog. this case was good for about one month then the velcro no longer closed and the knife was loose and fell out. So I not only lost my case I lost my $89.00 knife
5,.,"Fits my wingman. But also my wave . It's a good shetah. Simple, but well made. Also can hold an extra mini maglite and bit heads."
5,A good product at a reasonable price,I found this to be an excellent replacement for the leather sheath that comes with the Wave multitool. The leather sheath is very uncomfortable to wear on my belt but this is great!
4,Great,"I really enjoy this Sheath better than the one with that came with my New Wave. I can hold a lot of stuff in it. In mine I have the 40bit set, Bit Driver Extension, New wave, and a Fenix LDO1R2. I'm ready for almost anything as long as I have this sheath with me."
5,Awesome sheath,"This is a decent sheath. I use the sheath with all the pockets filled and it comfortably holds my Leatherman. I thought the sheath would be a tight fit with everything, but that is not so. I'm enjoying this product."
5,very good replacement holster for Leatherman,"I was very happy with this products quality, I have been using it for over a year now and have not seen any signs of wear or tear on it, It is on my belt every day of the year.8/7/2011 I have had this for almost 3-years now. I just ordered a replacement because the velcro is starting to get weak. i use my leatherman wave about every other day, so this sheath has gotten a lot of use and I am not surprised it is about time to be replaced."
5,Really good quality,This sheath is a very good quality . I would recommend to anyone looking for a sheath of this style
2,Leatherman needs to wake up.,"Leatherman needs to wake up as a company. What's with the new-found love for Velcro? What happened to the old fashioned snap-button closures? The ones that don't wear out after a few months of normal use and make about 1/6th the noise when you engage them? And is the sheath about twice the size of the old-style Wave sheath? Yes, to hold all the bits that you might use once a year. Still better than the leather version. Sad to see that Leatherman, Oakley and the rest of them are trying to fix things that definitely were not broken."
5,Perfect fit,This is the best case for my leatherman. Very durable and very strong Velcro. Idk boot you all but I need some thing strong I'm a IRONWORKER and my tools take a good ten hour a day beating. And with my harness on this case still upholds. So I rate it a five.
3,Get the leather sheathe instead.,If you bought the new Leatherman Wave you received this sheathe. Mine failed after 5 months despite the velcro being clean and lint free. Thats probably why you are looking at this nylon sheathe now.I just wrote a review of the leather sheathe which I just purchased and it smokes this nylon sheathe.In a pinch this will do but do yourself a favor.......buy the leather sheathe for a few extra bucks and get a much better product.
4,Nylon sheath?,"Actually I ordered and received a leather sheath for my leatherman wave. They want me to review a nylon one, so here goes. Had I received a nylon one I'm sure it would have been great! ; )"
4,"Durable, wish it didn't have velcro","Bought this for my husband as a back-up to the leather sheath that came with his Leatherman. It seems like it will be very durable, although the velcro is a drawback (loud and will probably wear out quickly). Still, it's just a back-up, and seems to be good quality."
3,It's ok...,It did ok but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Granted not many of us use or have combo cd/cassette players but we still need head cleaners that work. For the price it did alright.
5,Exactly what I needed,"I was going to buy a new sander, but found this replacement part instead. Spent $12 instead of $50. Btw, you have to actually poke holes in the sandpaper to make the saw dust catcher work."
2,Unneccessary,"This product is a waste of money, it is far more prudent to buy these items in a larger bulk package from Zildjan and just buy a new pedal like a double pedal if you need a more advanced beater!"
2,Young guns was a total let down,"The main fight which was between kevin randleman and Maurice Smith -EFC champion was not spectacular at all. Maurice was just limited by Kevin Randleman throughout the whole fight, but no punches occurred-were shot by randleman toward maurice. maurice was just limited in some type of hold throughout the whole match. this was very disappointing this was the highlight of the event. If you expect fists punching each other in this main even between these two gladiators well then you are wrong. things just dont repeat themselves, because mr. maurice smith shined on the EFC PART 3 video EXTREME FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP when he went against Conan Silviera. Now that was great kickboxing against mr. silviera. but this video young guns is not recommended at all. really a limit of time is the thing you are going to waste and the dollars you invest in this video."
2,Excellent !,"An excellent, must-have resource for any Missouri Pacific fans or modellers. Great quality pictures (and a lot of 'em), along with descriptive text about many of the movements and timelines for the railroad."
2,Purchased as a gift,"I have to admit that this set was purchased for my 7 year old grandson who loves to set up and knock down dominoes. The material that the dominoes are made of is good but they are really too thin to use them for what I intended. They are too thin for that and keep falling down. Not knowing anything about dominoes, I didn't check the width of the tiles prior to purchase. If you will use these for the intended purpose, they are fine, but for my little guy, it was a lot of money for nothing."
1,"Poor product, bad service!","I bought a Remote Start System and it does not work. The switch is always conductive on both positions. The system can not be programmed. The instructions are inconsistent from the booklet and their pre-recorded tech support message. The CD doesn't provide any useful information. They don't grant warranty if you bought it from on-line. (even they do, you still have to pay $20!)"
4,A good addition to any collecter,I constantly find myself going back to this book and looking up odd facts about both books I have read and books I havent. This is a great book for any serious sciencefiction fan.!
2,A bit off target,"This is a fairy nice book, and it's fun to look through (though I'm not sure I agree with all of the artist's interpretations) but I found it a little unsteady. I would invest in the excellent ""The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction"", it's more general but oddly, it's also more in depth."
1,I am not Esther,"The book was in poor shape, cover and spine of book is not intact. seller email me after I ordered and shipped. I didn't want to go through hassle and spend more money on shipping back."
3,Land of the Lost Season 3,A must have for any Land of the Lost Fan. Season 3 delves deeper into the the Land of the Lost and wraps up the series.
3,"good book, but get hardcover instead","the book i got was physically trashed because it was an old little missionary one, which is good if you serve in Africa and it will get ruined anyhow. If you live in a nice place and/or value your books, get a hardcover one"
5,What Would You Expect????,"A wonderful depiction of Sinatra as recording artist (emphasis on recording).As a musician who has performed with some of the artists on these sessions (although, sadly, never with Frank), so nice to read about some of the most historic recording sessions in American popular music history. As Pete Hamill wrote, Sinatra matters. A GREAT read."
5,THE BEST!,This has got to be one of the best biographies I've ever read! And I've read hundreds of biographies over some 50 years. But this is definetly at the top of the list. My congratulations to Mr. Granata. Frank Collett.
5,Amazing Video,This show gets closer to the tornado than any other and captures some amazing video of the violent storms.
3,Not the best tornado video.,"I own about ten tornado videos, and this one is not one of the better ones. It was a little boring in spots and some of the advice the commentator gave was incorrect. The storm chaser guy should have ""proof-read"" the video before releasing it."
4,Good but...,"The footage was definitely awesome! But it ran more like a PSA on tornado safety, which for someone like me isn't what I wanted. I just want raw footage of chases, along with background of the storms-how the chaser picked that storm/system over others, for example. If you can deal with a narrator saying over and over ""Jeff knew he was in danger...(etc)"" then it's a great DVD."
2,"Bought Four, Missing Parts in Two","The missing parts were the side rails that cover the screw heads. Had to return to sender and still waiting for replacements. Sender did not provide any packaging, just taped four mailboxes together and mailed. Slight dents and dings in several boxes. Would not recommend ordering from sender."
1,Flag Keeps Dropping in moderate wind.,"Recently purchased from Lowes and assembled with all parts (there is one washer for the flag). I immediately noticed how loose the flag movement was and became concerned. Sure enough, a few days later when mailing with the flag up, moderate wind kept blowing the flag down. I also note that a neighbor who purchased the same mailbox 2 years ago, did not have this problem. Considering this mailbox goes for $50, there is no excuse for such shody design ""improvement"". Also the instructions omitted what the plastic round tabs were for (to cover up the visible screw heads). DO NOT BUY. There are better ones availabe for less."
3,Good Looking Mailbox; Shipping/packing damage,"This mailbox came delivered by UPS in just its original cardboard box: No additional packing or outside box. Just like you would take it off the shelf at Home Depot. As a result, it was slightly damaged (dented). I decided not to return it because the damage was confined to an inconspicuous area. The mailbox is larger than a standard (T1) box, this being a T2. My mail carrier appreciates the box because we get lots of oversized mail which will fit into this box and keep him from having to get out of his jeep and bring it to my door. Because I was replacing a smaller mailbox, this box didn't fit properly on my old mailbox's post, so I wound up having to buy a $5 bracket for this mount properly. The box looks good, looks pretty durable, and I think it'll hold up for years to come."
2,Arrived Broken,"How can I expect a ""premium"" (?) mailbox to hold up if it falls apart in the mail? The box was barely damaged, but both of the bottom edge trim pieces that hold the bottom to the top had come off because the plastic screws broke in half. The top arch at one end was dented too. Now I have to mail it back. :-("
1,Frenzy,"This was advertised as Alfred Hitchcocks 1972 movie,instead got a1930s version. I,m not interested in this version. I've had nothing but trouble downloading movies from Amazon since I started doing it yesterday."
3,Real Thoughts,This book was hard to keep up with at first I thought it was a biography on Richard Wright.After reading and really getting into the book I then realized that she had a right to speak and write of their relationship. I felt that the book was informative and helpful in understanding a different side of Richard Wright. Everybody has more than one side to them.
1,"Empty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution, can not be used!","My Allsop 60000 3-in-1 (wet) Video Cleaner came with a dry/empty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution. Without the cleaning solution the cassette with a cleaning ribbon cannot be used. This is the 2nd time this has happen. First one I returned for a replacement. The replacement I received also came with a dry/empty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution, which I am returning for a refund.I think I was sold an old Allsop 60000 3-in-1 (wet) Video Cleaner that was storied in a warehouse for years and the cleaning solution in the package evaporated. I doubt if Allsop is still manufacturing this product. Amazon should check their stock of Allsop 60000 3-in-1 (wet) Video Cleaner before selling more of it."
5,good vcr cleaner,"Works really well, there is no problem with the tape ejectong like I had with other cleaners."
1,Junk II,I too bought this product and found it to be a total waste of money.....it doesn't even get within 10 degs of actual temperature and no calibration adjustments anywhere. I would never buy a product from this company again
1,leaky pc of junk,"2 weeks after putting it in my pool, it had water inside the display and was giving erroneous readings. Don't waste your $ on this."
1,Useless,"The themometer is USELESS and Amazon should eliminate it. Neither the description or package give performance details such as temp range, response time and accuracy. It takes about 5 minutes to change temp and then is about 10 degrees off!"
1,"leaky, Junk","This is not a very good product. Temp. is not accurate and after 3 weeks in my pool, water got inside it and it stopped working. Even without the water it never gave you the right Temp. I am only sorry I did not read reviews before I purchased it."
1,Do not buy this Thermometer!,This Hydro Tools 9250 SpaThermometer lasted about two or three weeks and then ended up getting all fogged up and now does not function. It reads about 4 degress too low. I would classify it as junk. Caveat Emptor!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6DHJA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,Hydro Tools 9250 Digital Pool/Spa Thermometer,worked ok for about two weeks then got moisture in the display and quit working. Has a blank screen.
1,Failed in 3 weeks,"Do not waste your money on this item. I bought it for the big display, it seemed to have a good reading but today its dead, it did not last 3 weeks. Also the bottom piece was loose, I had to wrap teflon tape around the unit for it to stay. Battery compartment is flimsy. The second I held the thermometer, I could tell it was not gong to last."
3,Still working after 3 years,I have had this since 2009. It still working after 3 years. The sun & cholorine got to the face of it and caused it to get yellowed out and hard to see through now. I also had to replace batterys twice. Other than that it worked fine. I did check the accuracy with a regular thermometer and it was only +/- 2 degrees on different days due to weather conditions. (Cloudy vs sunny). I am getting a new one for this year.
3,Last for couple months.,"I got this thermometer because I planed that it will be last for a while.Worked for couple of months. Scrow on the back fall, water got it. It's dead.May be I am not lucky but it looks like not the best quality. Should look better."
3,I don't know,"No problem with this except that moisture builds up under the glass and makes it hard to see the temp. Otherwise, ok product."
1,It leaks,"The temp seems fairly accurate, but the device leaks and the display is always ""foggy""...I would return it, but that takes time."
1,"Bought 2, both broke.",I purchased 2 of these. Both of them broke after a couple weeks in the hot tub. They just aren't built to withstand heat and wet at the same time.
1,Died after one month,"The thermometer was used in our hot tub. It lasted about a month. It went dead, with no information at all. We thought maybe it was the batteries. Changed them, still no joy. Would not buy another. Only consolation is that I am not alone in being taken by this company."
1,What a piece of garbage.,"I'm on my 2nd one. First one, within 2 days filled with water and the LCD temperature screen went blank. It was replaced with another brand new one, which lasted about 2 weeks. The new one is now stuck on 30 degrees. Really guys...how freakin' hard is it to manufacture a true waterproof pool thermometer? C'mon this isn't rocket science...its just a damned thermometer. Stop outsourcing to Asia and build a quality product here in the States. I'm actually willing to pay more if the thing lasts a while.LarryLong Island, New York"
3,Berlitz,I am learning Spanish for my fiancé and bought this book after rave reviews from a friend. The reason I gave this book an average rating is because this material is not for beginners or anyone without working knowledge of basic Spanish grammar.
1,Spoiled by tiresome navigation .,"There are hundreds of subsections of subsections in this needlessly complicated collection . Every other sentence is interrupted with a direction such as ( see 6F[ii] ) . Now WTF is ' 6F[ii] ' !!!!What on earth is so ' misleading ' about simple page numbers ?Complete lockup when trying to use the index , which is a mess of the above section and subsection references .In the end , I just gave up .More information is laid out cleanly in John Butt's "" Spanish Grammar "" . A much better book , organised and indexed around the idea of numbering the pages in order ....."
2,It was worth a try,My Hitachi DVD player started skipping words after it was playing for over 30 minutes. I tried this product. It didn't work.
4,Can't complain--it works!,"I bought a Corolla in the Middle East and found that the CD player wouldn't read audio CDs burned on a computer. It would read regular audio CDs. I was bummed. I decided to try this product since being in this area leads to a lot of dust on everything. I almost laughed when I took it out of the packaging. It's basically an audio CD with 5 tiny brushes scattered across the disk--actually all are at the same radius. I had little hope this would do anything. The ""touch here"" anti-static panels made me even more skeptical. I put it in the drive, listened to the directions, and then repeated the process just in case. I then put in the audio CD that didn't work 5 minutes before, and voila! Worked for me! That CD has worked ever since."
4,Nice! seems to work.,"I have external drive dvd, a 3dbr/d player,a computer w/built in dvd,and a dvd recorder,just install and listen to followed directions. to clean and be able to optimize each system is great.it's been about a year since i last cleaned them.i notice a big change in my devices.I think i gave this allsop ultra pro a decent test and it passed. good product."
1,"Did not work, caused more problems","I purchased this item in hopes of cleaning 3 CD players & 1 DVD player. I used it in our 99 Honda Odyssey cd player & now I either get ERROR or when it does decide to play, it only sounds normal for a few seconds before becoming 'scratchy' and unrecognizable. I have tried numerous cds after using this product with the same results. So, now I am faced with spending MUCH more than the $10 paid for this product to replacing the entire CD player- that was working prior to using the ALLSOP Ultra ProLens Cleaner (it just needed to be cleaned). Needless to say, I did not use it on any additional systems. I am not happy about this outcome & would NOT recommend this product."
3,Nice...but,"It worked great on my Mac laptop, and the add-on ""audio test"" features were more interesting than I expected when I ran them on my home stereo system. I have a two channel setup, but I can imagine this feature would be genuinely useful for people who haven't properly calibrated their home theater systems.But, the cleaner simply didn't work in my five CD exchanger. It ran through the setup, but would not go to the proper track to perform the actual cleaning. So...Plus: unlike some similar products that (according to reviews) don't work in laptop DVD drives, this one did.Minus: it doesn't work in my JVC 5-disc CD player, which is what I really wanted."
3,Better Than Memorex,"I used this on two CD players. One player seemed to have less skipping after running the disc about six times but the other player would not even accept the disc. I have also tried memorex CD/DVD lens cleaner and that did absolutley nothing for either CD players. I continue to use Allsop on a regular basis hoping it will eventually clean the lens enough to stop the skipping completely, but I may have to have both players professionally looked at."
1,USELESS FOR CD PIONEER PLAYERS,"Purchaed this supposed DVD/CD cleaner to clean my Sony and JVC DVD Player/Recorders. Saw NO improvement on DVD's and would NOT even load on either of my Pioneer 6-Disc Mag Players. Useless product and big waste of money. I had used Memorex's OptiDisc DC/DVD cleaner previously, but wasn't completely satisfied with cleaning, so was hoping this cleaner would be better based on reviews. But it was not. Do NOT Buy."
2,It only works once,"The one I have now is a replacement from Amazon and I'm just guessing how efficient it is; but, I can't get it to work a 2nd time...at all."
2,Did nothing for my CD Player,A total waste of money. I tried cleaning the CD head as layed out in the instructions. I tried it THREE times and it did nothing.A Total waste of money.
2,3 cd Players & a Computer ------------- ZERO Results,"I was excited about all the positive results but very disappointed by the results I got. I had one Mac laptop, 1 sony home stereo and 2 car stereos that was not working. I definitely expected at least one of them to start working. But I received zero results.If you don't believe me, I recommend buying it from a store that will allow you to return it if it doesn't work."
5,Worked Great in XBOX,"I was constantly getting the could not read disk on brand new disks, threw this in ran it and have not had a hiccup since. It worked great"
2,DVD Drive Cleaner,"I have 2 DVD players that skip on almost all of my DVD's. Unfortunatly, this item did not solve my problem. The price was worth a try, but it didn't work for me."
4,Rod,"Good product but when you insert the disc it gives you a lot of superfluous information. Most folks, like me would be happy just putting the disc in the player, perhaps listening to some technical information or music while it is cleaning and then when the disc is finished it just says so. It should just let me select the other features that are offered on the product instead of automatically prompting me to use them as if I must do those things every time I clean the player."
3,Didn't solve problem,"I was getting a lot skipping from rented and new DVD's. Read the reveiws and thought I would give this cleaner a try. It did not solve my problem, but my high end DVD recorder is in the shop and maybe it's not a dirty lens causing the problem??Product was well made and the sound check is excellent. I think overall this is a good cleaner it's just not a fix all solution."
1,Dud for DVD,"The DVD player at home is skipping and pixillating with new and older DVDs, so I was looking for something that might clear it up. Reviews suggested this was the very thing. It was not. Once in the machine, it simply played the same voice message over and over and over and over that the device was wonderful - but nothing else happened - ever. I will return it and look for something else. This might or might not work fine for CD player, but my issue is with a DVD player, so back to the drawing board."
3,Review,"Overall the product was good improving sound quality. The problem with it is that it really doesn't do much to improve the performance of the system. The product seemed more directed towards improving only the audio aspect of the lens. Perhaps if it were more versatile with it's cleaning or performance it would get a better review. I used it to clean the lens of my game system hoping to restore it back to a fairly good condition. However, shortly after receiving the product i discovered that it did little to improve the performance of the system fore I was still experiencing skipping and lagging when trying to play a game in good condition. But, I must say that it did improve the audio quality even though I purchased it hoping to improve the performance."
2,allsop cleaner,this didnt help my dvd player at all it keeps saying disc can not be played so until i figure what it is this cleaner didnt work for me so far
3,look elsewhere for introduction to simone,"There are lots of better Nina Simone albums out there. The Tomato Collection contains lesser heard songs, and a few gems like 'Just in Time,' 'Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,' and 'Solitude,' but overall the 37 tracks lack focus and cohesion. The combination of high-quality recording with tracks of low-quality, and the variations of live and studio recordings give off a disjointed mood. Unless you're looking for specific songs, check out Anthology (easily the best Simone double disc collection), Sugar in My Bowl: The Very Best of Nina Simone, The Essential Nina Simone, Village Gate, or Verve Jazz Masters for better quality and continuity."
3,Did not like this one,"I have read ""Winter Serpent"", a novel by this author (written under the name of Maggie Davis)and it was excellent. I decided to give this one a try as well, but totally could not get into it. My rating is based on the fact that it was obvious that the book was very well researched and as the other reviewers stated has an authentic feel as to the time, place and actions/reactions of characters. As a romance tough, it did not work for me. The hero in my opinion is not very likable and seemed to have no use of heroine other than the obvious one. No idea why she decides that she suddently loves him (maybe she couldn't think straight because of all the blows to the head he gave her). Also there is a rather disturbing scene when she breastfeeds a puppy in attempt to cure engorged breasts. That was just...eww."
2,Unconvincing love story.,"This novel features an unlikable couple. The hero is suspicious that his wife is sleeping with every other man around, yet cannot stop himself from lusting after her. The wife was clealy infatuated with another man throughout the entire novel and yet miraculously claims to be in love with her husband at the end. She does not try to gain her husband's trust and generally does not even like him. It seems that the only reason she stayed is becaus she did not have the option of running away. If this were a historic novel with some element of love in it, it would probably have received a higher rating from me. For a romance novel I suggest you look elsewhere. I'm not convinced that these two even like each other, nevermind love."
1,Forget it. They destoyed the band.,"THE CAGE is another sad example of a potentially good band going to oblivion due to record company pressure and bad decisions. In this 1983 album, producer Peter Collins led the band to record a dreadful commercial album full of love lyrics and a slick sound close to hair metal. The result was familiar: they lost the old fans and managed to gain few new ones...This album is so bad, that you can not believe it is the same band that recorded ""WILD CAT"" only three years ago."
5,Top of My List Even Until Now,"Im a pretty traveled person, and I see PJ's glimpses every now and then. It makes a great present for my mates. I read it over again when I feel I need a good laugh. I love the part about the French."
5,Still a riot,"A little dated due to the world events related, but it is still the laugh out loud book I read over twenty years ago. A true weisenheimer's guide to world politics."
3,an old book...,"The essay on America's Cup was laught out loud funny! I read a book by Bob Baer at the same time I read the story about Beirut. Interesting, in as much, as it was a look at events in a city in the same time period but from very different angles. Most of the book though just wasn't that humorous."
5,Holidays in Hell,"This is one of the funniest books I've read in my life (47 yrs).I made the mistake of attempting to read it while on break at work a couple of times, but I could not control my laughter, and ended up unable to return to working or getting odd looks from coworkers in the break area. I spent most of the time reading it at home with my face streaked with tears from laughter.PJ O'Rourke has an almost supernatural ability with humorous metaphores, and manages to capture the people and events in his books with incredible accuracy. It's that accuracy that is so damned funny. Rarely will you read an author so able to articulate that which most of us REALLY are thinking about certain scenarios - people and events. He spares nothing. He is a political correctness VACUUM. His concise satire will get you addicted to his style. The man is a genius."
1,"Dull, depressing, formulaic and not even funny","I paid 1 for this in a sale. I was grossly overcharged. I read less than half of it before giving up.O'Rourke can be amusing for a short time in the same way as a saloon bar loudmouth, but is equally tedious after any prolonged exposure. His formulaic writing style and ill-informed ranting are tiresome in the extreme. I can only assume that his popularity is down to a significant number of people who have similarly small minds and like to read someone who shares their prejudices and never challenges them.Judging from this book, I'd be surprised if Mr O'Rourke ever gains any pleasure from travel. I would guess that he only does it to give himself something to write about - it's his job, after all."
3,"Works fine, although complicated.","Keep the manual handy, you'll need it to figure out how it works. I don't think it should have to be this complicated. But it works pretty well in my self contained travel trailer with 12 volt solar electric power (so I do not use the C batteries in it) and is small enough to be easily tucked away. It seems to be sturdy (not rugged) and works well for what I want it for......weather reports, news and occasionally TV. I found it on clearance at a Wisconsin Farm & Fleet store for $19.95, so I think it was well worth the price and will be happy if it lasts a couple years."
4,Girl don't get enough play,"I have been listening to this album for a little over a year now. I had to have this cd sent to me from the labels website, which was fine and all but WHY ISN'T IN STORES! I heard Pearcy's 'natural disaster' one night on some obscure college radio station and I got all goosepimpley. Her voice is so beautiful and her songs are so well crafted. Words are escaping me at the moment, but if you want to hear a beautiful voice singing cleverly about love and such then buy this, love this, keep it with you always."
5,ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE BANDS!!!,"Ultimate girl rock, not like the old Riot Grrrl crap. The music of Stone Fox is a fascinating blend of melodic and abrasive. From hard rock with fuzzy bass to ballads with just vocals and a 12-string, these chicks (and 1 guy) know how to make the music work for them."
3,Mouse Pad,This is not a bad mouse bad however it is not very comfortable. It slips away from under the arm.
4,A good book that vividly talls the story about a teen father,"This is a very good book, The main charector is fun to learn about, its an actual book that displays what teen life is really about."
3,A book that really tells the turth.,This book could you some work but in all in all it was a good book I would not rank on the best seller list but I will say the moral values were outstanding and powerful my daughter cryed though out the hole story.
2,Merely a synonym finder,"The built-in thesaurus in my version of Microsoft Word was more comprehensive. Not recommended for professional use, maybe for pre-college students. It's at least a portable (if not terribly useful) little tome. You're better off upgrading to a real Roget's."
2,"They have taken the name ""ROGET'S"" and run with it!!!","This stinker is in DICTIONARY format. DICTIONARY format is not, to use a euphemism, for the (another euphemism) intelligensia.The thing is overfat and the typeface is so tiny not even my best bifocals are not able to [whoops! need a REAL thesaurus].Go for the Roget's International. That one is in TRADITIONAL format: a word list in the back with reference to a number leading to a logical IDEA-ORIENTED section towards the front.This stinker is nothing more than a LEXICON FOR DUMMIES!!!"
5,An ocean of words I enjoy swimming in!,"""Thesaurus"" is Latin for ""treasury"", but all the editions that I came across in my long search of a good one had been anything but. They were either too bulky or too brief, severely abridged or arranged by concepts (!) with alphabetical index at the end. Looking for the right word in these circumstances caused me excruciating pain, both mental and physical. I was in great danger of being sucked in by a tornado of strange, confusing, irrelevant words.Thankfully, I discovered this book. And what a treasury it is! The dictionary format, 450,000 entries, 1 million word results, a wonderful concept index on the back which shows how a word fits into a pool of similar ones - these are only some of the many highlights of this edition. Not only do I keep it by my side every time I sit down to write, but often look into it for pure pleasure, partaking of the wealth it stores."
3,Why so tiny?,"This thesaurus really is perfect. The most comprehensive I have ever seen. But the font is too small to read comfortably for most rather elderly adults. Do buy the Paperback edition, whose font is a litter bigger."
2,I've read better!,"I've read many children's chapter books, and this one was not very interesting, exciting, or accurate! Another one with Blackbeard in it is based on good research. It is called The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo by K.J. McWilliams"
4,Great fun and no mess!,"This is a very nice product. Really not much mess, just make sure your kids put the lids on though. Kinda expensive in my eyes."
1,Look closely,I ordered this radio for meetings and when I finally got it Iwas very dissapointed. They did miss one thing the Radio does not have atrack counter so you don't know what track your playing. Not Cool.
3,Good radio for the money. We use it in our son's bedroom.,Don't expect to use this as a soundsystem for a party. The sound is lousy at higher volumes.Overall quality is good. The CD player works very well and the tape player is fine too. Radio reception is very good. I can pick up some distant stations. The antennae isn't the greatest. The handle gets in the way of the antennae. We haven't had a single problem with it and we've used it daily for almost a year.But it is a good deal for the money. I would buy one again.We use is mostly in our 3 year old son's room to play some quiet bedtime music.
2,Playback problems,"Upconversion works great and the picture is excellent when it does work. I have watched 3 dvds so far and 2 out of 3 had screen artifacts during playback, picture would freeze for anywhere from 1-5 second and then it would start playing normally. The first DVD I played in it experienced these problems but I figured that it was a problem with the DVD itself then once the 3rd DVD experienced the same problems I begun research and have found other who have exact same problems with this model. I can't recommend this palyer to anyone until Toshiba fixes their problem."
2,Toshiba HDMI Trouble,"I bought this Toshiba SD-4980 to go with a new HD-ILA JVC tv that has an HDMI input. I found the picture quality using HDMI input to be very good comapred to my RCA progressive scan DVD player and was impressed with the improvement in picture using the upconversion feature.However I returned the first unit because it would randomly pause for a few seconds during the middle of playback, not related to the DVD being played (it would freeze in different places on the same DVD). I returned the first unit and tried a second unit only to find that it did the same thing so it was also returned.I liked this DVD player but it is very distracting for the movie to stop suddenly and so sadly like one of the previous reviewers I will not be using this unit until Toshiba fixes the issue."
1,DVD Playback Pauses Unacceptably,"Unfortunately, I like the other reviewers here found that my 4980 unit paused unacceptably and randomly throughout playback (usually about once an hour during a movie). I contacted Toshiba and they quickly arranged to replace the unit with another 4980.This unit arrived with the same exact problem; as a matter of fact, I went to my local Best Buy just for grins and picked up another 4980, and IT TOO had the same exact problem. I quickly returned that unit.I contacted Toshiba once again, and still claiming ignorance of any known issue with the 4980, offered to replace it with a 6980, worth about twice as much. I readily agreed, and if they indeed do so, and it doesn't have the pause problem, I'll be quite content."
1,Bad Buy,I primarily bought this unit for the HDMI/upconvertion. We bought one unit and experienced freezing and horrible colors out of the HDMI. Called Toshiba and they confirmed that it was a bad unit. We exchanged for a new player which worked fine for about one day then experienced the same problems. We will be returning this unit as well and replacing with a different brand.
2,"Toshiba's weak link ""Drive motor""","Toshiba makes a quality product. I have been buying from the Toshiba line for 20+ years. The SD-4980 is a great DVD player for the price, I have had mine for about 8 months now and it see's a lot of use. This week the disk drive motor gave out. This will be 8th Toshiba in 7 years, all having suffered the same drive motor fate. Some have made it a year, most have not, but like I said they do see a lot of use. You will need to step up in price range for a longer lived unit. ""You Get What You Pay For"""
2,you get what you pay for...,"I've had this DVD player for over a year and have had the same problems other reviewers have listed. It skips, it doesn't play things I've burned one time and the next time it will, it crashes which requires you to unplug it each and every time. BUT...it plays DivX. That helps. - Spend your money on something better. Too many crashes too often and not enough good things to offset the bad including the price."
2,Bad Playback,Plus: Good Picture quality in HD modeMinus: It won't play recorded DVD's. and lot othersI would not recommend this DVD player
3,Good book,This book provide a very good source of information and teaches the basics about painting business what i dislike about the book is that is old and was written a long time ago so half of the techniques might not work now . But i recommend the book overall
5,A Must Read !!!,"Nurse Bray chronicles one woman's love of her profession as a nurse in England before, during and after WWII. While it is a heartfelt story of her personal challenges and ambitions, the reader will also delight in the history of nursing through Nurse Bray's eyes. Ardalan's attention to personal details makes the story (and the history) come to life. I read it in one sitting !!!"
3,Much smaller than shown in the picture,"If you are not familiar with carat size, you are going to be disappointed. These earrings are much smaller than shown in the picture. They are suitable for a baby rather than an adult.However, they do sparkle.UpdateI've had these for 4 months and they are nice, tiny earrings.Nonetheless, I lost (but found it later) one of the earrings in my house because one of the earrings has a loose friction-back closure. I should have checked them more carefully when they arrived and returned them. My earring had some problems so be aware."
2,"maybe this is true, but...","Buddhists have 4 noble truths based upon natural human suffering, being powerless over it, etc., and 8 paths to enlightenment that essentially say ""you must change your life."" AA historians are often people in the AA program, mostly who've been around for years, who collect old writings and documents, many of which were never kept very accurately in the early days of AA, and claim to know the ""secret"" of AA. But, given the 12 steps' strong correlation to Buddhists principles, maybe something Bill and Bob never got honest about was where they truly got the 12 steps from. After, all 4+8=12."
3,it's alright,"This movie is alright, not one of their funniest. If you want this as part of a collection, then buy it. However, if you want this to see this for some laughter, it's just alright."
4,Forever Darling Review by Nicky,"It was a good movie. Starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. I can't believe The Long, long Trailer and Forever Darling are in color really well, I'd think it's more recent than it is.James Mason is a funny character as well as a guy who teaches Susan (Lucy). Lorenzo or Larry (Desi) cannot se the gaurdian angel, neither can Susan's father.The couple gets into a fight one day, and then James Mason gives advice to Susan. And they go on a trip together to test out some product. They still sometimes get into fights, but in the end, as always, all is good."
1,ONLY FOR LUCY/DESI DIEHARDS!,This is a terrible movie. When it came out in 1956 it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers. Time had only added to it's mediocrity.
5,Delightfully Romantic!,"This is a story about a marrige that has gone limp. The husband (Desi Arnaz) is preoccupied with his job and the wife (Lucille Ball) begins to have romantic daydreams to makeup for the loss of romance in her marrige. When the marrige seems to come to an end, with the help from an angel, they find their love for eachother once again. This film is delightfully romantic and humorous!"
4,A Good Movie,My Favorite Is The Long Long Trailer From These Two Great Actors --- This Movie Is Good In Its Own Way ----But Not Like The First Movie They Made --- More Like The I Love Lucy TV Show ----Still Worth A Watch --- In Color
2,Disappointed in Forever Darling,"Few laughs and drawnout, but nice to see Desi & Lucy together on screen."
4,"A funny, touching movie with lots of fun and some laughs.","Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz star in this great, all Lucy movie. Lucy and Desi play a married couple who think their marriage is in a rut. But Lucy's gaurdian angel (James Mason) shows up and after lots of trying, their marriage is saved. The movie is a little long, and gets a little bit boring towards the end, but I would say this is a must see, must have. I't a true Lucille Ball classic, something to treasure and enjoy watching."
5,this video was made 4 Lucy& Desi,"hey! I'm 15 and i'm a big Lucy fan, and i thought this was one of Lucille Ball's finest piece of work. I bought this video off of Ebay.com not sure if it would be good or not. and believe me it was worth it! it also shows a little bite of the Arnaz's hard times off the camera. It had so many funny parts like the very beginnig. i recomend this video who is a Lucy/Desi or both fan, this is a video for you."
5,Refreshingly Hot!,"This man is the sweetest thing that I have heard in a real long time! He is so original and somehow manages to come across as a familiar voice coming across the radio waves. I HIGHLY recommend this to an hip hop conniouseur. He is the best thing that has come alive this year....Im so impressed. The music is like hip hop folk with beats that are hot and smooth, atmospheric experience...."
3,"Expensive, does not deliver...","I am not too happy with it. As one other reviewer said the quality of the sound is not good, and it is hard to get any sound at all (really hard sometimes! ) ... a bummer for such an expensive product. You can't even hook up the speakers directly to the speaker jack (? ) you have to hook up the speakers to headphone jacks.. Anyways if you are going to use it for a stereo system (according for the instructions) the quality should be better... But for a Computer to hear MP3's in your room or real audio , the product is not up to par. Plus for the price they should throw in the compatible Headphones. For a 900mhz product my 900mhz phone has better reception and somewhat equal sound... I wonder if this product is not analog."
3,Advent AW870 Wireless Powered Speakers,The sound quality is below par. NO base and there is a constant hissing sound. When the volume is increased the sound gets very distorted. The advantage is that it is very easy to set up any where to about 150' away without runnig wires. Good additonal set of speakers to setup in different locations outside/indoor in a small area for parties but not a good set of speakers to listen too as your main speakers.
1,Poor Sound Quality,There is not much to say about these wireless speakers. Their sound quality is very poor and represents an excessively high price to pay for the convenience of avoiding the installation of wires.
2,Advent tuning problems,I recently purchased the Advent AW870 Wireless Powered Speakers and found them to be very difficult to tune properly. The signal would drift in and out with alot of distortion. Then I picked up RCAs (WSP200) new wireless speakers with their transmitter and speakers having 3 preset 900 MHz channels. This was a snap to get up and running and worked great. I was even able to tune the advent speakers to the RCA tranmitter very quickly. I came to the conclusion that the Advent transmitter is much more difficult to use and I would not recommend the Advent series because of the transmitter.
2,Just OK,The speakers are supposed to work up to 300 feet away. I have the receiver in my dining room and tried putting the speakers in my bedroom (maybe 50 feet away). The static was so bad I had to take them out. This was going through several walls. I have placed the speakers closer to the receiver and they sound just OK. I think it would be better to have some nice wired speakers with very long cable. It would sound a lot better.
2,Quite Disappointed,"After searching this section and reading the reviews of this product, I finally thought I had a 900 mhz speaker set that would work. So I ordered it. Big disappointment. It seems to work fine within about a 10 foot radius of the small signal station, but beyond that reception is sketchy at best--not even as good as my 900 mhz phone, oddly. In particular, the system seems to have problems when the speakers are not in line-of-sight contact. So while this may be an okay system to create ""surround sound"" near your TV, it's really not powerful enough to use as a way to carry signals from your stereo into other rooms."
4,Artist Speaking about his own Work,"This excellent documentary of the great German artist has mostly footage of him speaking about his own work, which is for me the very best way to help me understand any artist's work. His remarks as well as the accompanying biographical information are excellently done. The only reason I give it only 4 stars is that he's not one of my favorite artists."
3,better title would be 'heck in the pacific',"Heck in the Pacific (it wasnt Hell). a reasonably goodish movie despite very little dialoge. The abrupt ending was a disapointment , very little thought gone into it. the DVD had an alternate ending but very litlle thought gone into it also. i enjoy japanese movies however the average person would find it boring except for a few places"
5,Excellent,"Hell In The Pacific is one of the most excellent films of our times. Truly showing the eternal search for peace, yet with the first encounter with the globalization machine, the media, and propaganda, this is shattered."
4,"With little-to-no dialogue, this film is one to watch","My fiance got me the DVD as a present to me on his birthday. It sat for a month and then we finally watched it together. I was amazed that there was no dialogue... really. Very little. And when we were watching the DVD, we did not choose the option for subtitles and only realized that option after we'd seen the film. Overall it is a film to watch -- really watch. After you see it once without the subtitles, watch it again with them. Makes it a totally different experience. The acting and directing is incredible and one is left wondering, what the screenplay of this film actually looked like. Not too many special features but there is an alternate ending that is interesting."
3,One of the weirder war movies I've seen,"It's been a long time since I saw this on the big screen (I was in my teens), but I remember a few vivid images of this intense drama of two men, one American, one Japanese, stranded together on a tiny Pacific island. Although bitter enemies, the y each go through a transformation of character and purpose, forced upon them by their harsh circumstances. In a way, the film is as much a commentary on how mankind can get along, or how we can destroy each other, depending on which way the wind blows (literally, here). Parts of the movie seem to drag on with little development, while others are rich in humor, sadness, violence, and characterization. I didn't like the ending, as it seemed pointless. However, that may well be the message of the entire movie."
3,"Incomplete, murky, May-04 version from MGM","MGM cut the heart out of this excellent intense movie, when it excised the scenes of ""training"" Lee Marvin by Toshiro Mifune in the art of sword/staff fighting, and the scenes of hand to hand combat in/around the abandoned freighter. Further, the video quality is so dark one can sometimes barely follow the action."
4,a fine exam of cultures,"Two fine players in a worthwhile examination of the multiple levels of engagement in wartime, culture, and cooperation. A valuable film to see more than once, and to think about, with a historical perspective. Well-recommended."
4,A most unusual war film,"Two soldiers, one American, one Japanese, trapped together alone on a small Pacific island during WWII. What will happen? Very interesting character study with irrational and inventive clashes, and forced compromises, with superbly acting and nice cinematography. Up until very near the end I really liked it, but unfortunately I found the climax very open-ended and weak. Too bad, it was a great story with no real ending. But with images and performances so memorable. Thumbs up."
1,Hair Still Falls Out,"Guys, it is inevitable. You are going bald. Products like Rogaine and Nioxin are not going to help a receding hair line. Embrace it, the sooner the better. Sellers will log on and give their own product 5 stars to get you to buy it. I have been using it for 3 months, and my hair continues to fall out. 10 - 15 solid hairs will fall out during the shampoo, more during the conditioner. I quit recently. It feels like its tingling and working on your head, but the results are dreadful. Its like Grandpa's Simpson Alixir. Complete nonsense. Save your money."
2,Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner,"It got 2 stars because it does smell nice. I've been using for almost 6 months now and honestly.....I see no difference in my hair at all. Maybe it's like medicine. What works for one may not work for another. So, if you've never used it before, give it a try. Maybe it will work for you."
2,Getting worried....,"I've been using this set for about a month and I'm starting to get worried that it is really not working. I noticed that after about 8 hours, my scalp will start to itch quite a bit again and I think my hair is falling out a lot more than it was when I was using a previous product. Before this I was using Regenepure which was working pretty well but is a lot more expensive. I saw this was ranked high and you get huge bottles for pretty cheap so decided to try it, but I think I might have to go back to Regenepure. My wife also tried using this set and didn't notice a difference. They might be healthy for your scalp but I don't really recommend them to someone that is trying to stop hair loss."
3,"Sturdy and fits the knife well, but...","Pros:- The Charge fits snugly- The side elastic pocket does allow carrying a small LED light.- The leather and stitching seems very sturdyCons:- The plastic holder with extra bits that comes with Charge does not fit well. When inserted, the snap will not close."
5,Great belt sheath for your leatherman knife; it expands.,"It works with the Leatherman Wave knife, too."
4,Cover the Metal Name Plate,I have used this leather case since December '05 with my leatherman and the only complaint that I have is the name plate is made of a soft metal that leave marks on walls. I wear this case on my belt on my right side (being right handed) and I was always brushing up against walls and leaving marks to show where I had been. I covered it with a wrap around piece of black electrical tape and haven't had any more problems.
2,BAD BAD BAD!,An electronics fan from New York State USA They are not good radios! they do not function right and always break. I'm from a company who rates diffrent dadios do not come out on top. Out of 350 radios tested it can out as 310th it is a waste of money!
4,I like the Dewalt better,"Bought this, and it works OK. But I later replaced it with the Dewalt. Liked the Dewalt better, but can't remember why."
1,Poor quality,The top of these cufflinks broke from the stem within 2 weeks of purchase (only 2nd time wearing). Not impressed.
4,A LOST SOUL FOUND,"NEVER HEARD OF THE BROTHER TOOK A CHANCE AND FOUND A TRUE WINNER! GREAT PHILLY SOUL ARTIST WITH REAL PASSION FOR HIS CRAFT,HE REMIND ME OF THE KING OF INDY SOUL (ERIC ROBERSON),THAT IS SAYING ALOT FOLKS! ERIC HAS USED THIS BROTHER ON HIS TRACKS.GOOD PRODUCTION (TOUCH OF JAZZ) AND LYRICS TO BOOT!BE SURE TO COLLECT THIS ONE IT WILL BE WORTH IT!"
5,Excellent...and he didn't even have to cuss!,Big props to V. I look forward to much more from him. I've told all my friends who just like good music. This album just feels good from start to finish.
5,dinnerware,These plates are very nice looking for everyday use and have held up without fading or scratching off. I am very pleased with them.
3,Mediocre,"This book was not really that great. It was only somewhat helpful to my students. Plus, it is outdated because the APA manual is now on its 6th edition."
5,Outlook on Life,"The very funny story, makes you laugh because the ""..Little Woman"" always laughs at activities. As a teacher I use this wonderful story in my 4th grade classroom for a lesson on charater building, that good things can come out of bad situations as long as you believe in yourself. The little woman kept her laughter even in a bad situation and that laughter is what helped her out of that bad situation. I also use the story as an introduction to Asian Tales."
4,tee-hee-hee-he,"A little women makes dumplings, a dumpling rolls down a hill and that is how her adventure begins. I like this book becouse it has a little bit of seeing for your self. I think if you like adventures with a little bit of humor thrown in, you'll love the funny little women."
4,Remarkably good,"This is an exhaustive collection packed with short fiction of very high quality. Ellison writes with authority about the shadows and their denizens. However, his stories are best digested in small doses as the disturbing and powerful prose deserves reflection. Highly recommended. The only discernible weakness to Ellison's fiction is his insistence on creating only worlds of unremitting darkness. One would hope such a talent could sprinkle some beauty into his horror."
1,Hugely Disappointing!,"Recorded from a live performance in 1963! It is a terrible waste of CD media! A 33 album, which was purchased by me in the late 60's has 20 times the quality of this junk CD. Alain Barriere sounds like a drunk, sick cow and the amount of audience noise obscures the entire CD. There is not a good song on the entire CD. This CD isn't worth 10 cents. Rating this CD with one star is a gift!"
2,An Over Priced Infomerical,"While this book offers some good information, most of it can be found elsewhere for a much lower price. It appears the primary goal of the author is to convince the reader that managing one's own estate is far too complex and should be left to an investment advisory firm, preferably his!The book would be a reasonable value at about one quarter of the outrageous price. Save your money and look else where."
2,Not well centered,"Purchased the ""Improved Design!"" version of the Porter-Cable 59375 Strike and Latch Template. The locator pins would not accuratly center on a 1 3/8"" door. The intructions and illustrations are poor. It took a while to relealize the hole for the locator pin was off by an 1/8"". I had to center the jig on the door manually. The results were OK, but it would have been nice if it worked as designed. It may work for other door thicknesses.If you buy this jig, make sure you double check the centering before turning on the router. If not, the result could be be a nice cutout in the wrong place :(It is going back."
4,"It Works, But Looks Like it Costs 50 Cents","It works like it should. The only problem I have with mine is when I unpacked it, the wax used to protect the router bit reacted with the plastic of the jig and melted a hole right through the wall of the jig. Fortunately it was in a slot I don't plan to use."
1,What product do you get?,"Close up picture of the tool is similar to the style available 5 years ago, except that the nails are loose, not held in their holes. The pictures of the guy using the tool show an entirely different design, so what tool do you actually get?BEWARE Any review older than 2010 is likely to be worthless if the tool has been re-designed."
3,"CORPORATE AMERICA, YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.","I LIKE THE PORTER-CABLE STRIKE AND LATCH TEMPLATE. IT'S VERSATILE, SIMPLE AND FUNCTIONS WELL. YOUR WORK WILL NOT SUFFER FROM AN UNPROFESSIONAL LOOK. THE COST HAS FORCED ME TO DEDUCT 2 STARS. IT'S PLASTIC! COME CORPORATE AMERICA, YOU'RE THE PROBLEM. DON OUT."
3,Not useful enough for all applications.,"This template works for the most part. However, my certain installation included ball catch style latches at the top of french doors. This template can not be secured to the doors when the ball catch assembly needs to be installed near the top opening edge of the doors. It is also fairly expensive for the quality of product. Reasons: 1) No case. I could see the parts getting lost without any case to keep things in and these parts are critical for the template to be of any use. 2) Plastic can get damaged over many uses. For a door installer, this product will get worn out from the repetitive nailing and removing into multiple projects. I understand that it is made of a plastic material so that it does not kill router bits if you accidently touch the template with the bit blade, which could happen when inserting or removing the router from the work area. But, still, this plastic will wear out with heavy use."
2,This should have been better.,"Crasta's a pretty good writer, very talented and all. But I read this book based on what he said on his website -- that it was daring and controversial. It really isn't. It's a humorous piece of writing but is really more cute than meaningful."
1,Waste of Money,"If you are serious or even semi serious about working out with a heavy bag don't buy this. It is a piece of garbage that barely utilizes a heavy bag and the whole tape moves at a ridiculously slow pace! I barely got through the first segment without falling asleep.I was looking for something to mix up and add to my Billy Blanks Impact workout which is only 1/2 hour. The Billy Blanks workout far surpasses this one even though I find that one slow paced too.In my opinion, I would give this workout negative stars, five of them!"
2,Did not have white safety shroud with it,"It was suppose to be brand new unit unopened, but when I received it, it did not have the white safety shroud with it. I will have to install without it."
4,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"This book is an excellent example of a style of writing that no has really duplicated in past years. How Victor Hugo slyly involves the reader in the story is ingenious.While the story does have its moments that lack action of any sort, the detailed descriptions of the scenes give you the impression that he was witnessing the events of the book and telling them to you firsthand.Also the characters are extremely well fleshed out and complicated. They are so engrossing because of their qualities, and made even more interesting because of their faults.An excellent, tragic read, and made even better if you have traveled to Paris in recent years."
3,good if you can make it to the end,This book was a toughie for a half-wit like me. I honestly am not sure what was going on the first half of the book. I don't think I cared either as it was pretty boring. And then the second half comes along and the plot really develops into an interesting story. But there were times when I was tempted to give up and stop reading altogether - maybe pick up the pocket classic version instead. But I think the finale made it worthwhile. I think another problem for me was that I started the book with zero knowledge of the story so all the characters were alien to me. I think I might have appreciated the early on parts more if I had a better idea how things were going to turn out.I liked Les Mis. which goes a little heavy on description at times but Les Mis. seemed more 'even' as this book is weighted heavily on the front end with description and set-up.
4,Golf Handbook for Women,"This book gave me an excellent guide to start golf by providing detailed illustrations for each step, such as grib. Those illustrations help beginners to understand basic golf skills easily. Along with my golf lessons, this book gave me helpful tips to correct my mistakes. However, this illustration-oriented instruction may make advanced golfers feel lack of information for their levels. Anyhow, as a beginner, I loved this book, Golf Handbook for Women!"
3,deteriating rubber,"This is my third Porter-cable sanding pad. I don't use the sander very often. Even when not used the ruber in the pad dries out and falls apart. This takes several years, and is probably caused by ozone attacking the rubber. Maybe keeping the pad sealed in a zip lock would help."
5,sander pad,"Pad got here rather quickly after ordering, also seems to be of better quality than pad that come with sander. Very satified and will purchase again."
4,Educational AND interesting!,"While a few years old now, A Womans Place is still a fascinating history of women in Australian politics. Inspirational and great to use for those pesky Government essays."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this one folks- it consists mostly of commonly found NASA video snips without sound that we've all seen many times. Oly the B-58 footage is intresting, but that alone is not worth the price of the DVD."
5,Things Unspoken,"I concur with the Los Angeles Times. This is certainly one of the best books I have ever read. It kept my interest from the beginning to the very end. I don't read much, but, I finished this book in five days. I can't wait until the next one comes out."
5,Great book - higly recommended,"I loved this book. It was poignant, funny and very well written with strong character development. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time and I am going to recommend it to my book group as a must read."
5,Things Unspoken,"Excellent book~!! I enjoyed it from Page One until the very end. Well written, it will keep your attention until the story is over. You will miss the characters for days, after you have finished the book.Highly recommended."
3,soso,"initally has a good start but then drags on...good book to take to beach on a long vacation...kind of flat from middle to end....mostly b/c ""things"" are held in by the main character so in that sense true to plot...3/4 of the way through I started to skim to find out end of story...which was predictable and flat..."
3,Not as described,"Unfortunately, you must check the manufacturer's web site for an accurate description of this item. The information for this listing is not complete and the photo does not represent what you will receive. This is even more important since this item is priced at a premium, expensive to ship and costly to refund."
5,The Real Thing!,"Here is a poet who knows what she is doing. Rhythm, language, feeling, simplicity, complexity, surprise. Sex, time, birth, nature, art. Annie Finch transcends current categories. No wonder there are remarks from such different kinds of poets on this cover together..."
2,"Derivitive, Imitative, and Sub-standard British Fare","There are a lot better mysteries from Britain than this one (Inspector Lewis, for one). Nathaniel Parker plays a landowning Oxford grad who decides to become a police detective (a la Lord Peter Whimsey, who was far more interesting and entertaining). The decision is questioned by his peers, and rightly so, because all he brings to the table is a pretty face, a cow-eyed look, and an aggressive manner. The plots are standard--the hero and heroine are detective partners who secretly are in love with each other. And you really don't care about who the murderer or murderers are. The character of the medical examiner is a direct steal from the one played by David Macallan on NCIS, except that he is younger and better looking. In fact, the shows tend to feature handsome men and plain women, plainly dressed,some in need of dental work. On the plus side, the background music and the photography (beautiful looks of London) are superior."
1,Desktop charger,I was not happy with this item. This desktop charger didn't charge my battery. It wore out the life of the battery instead. I returned this item already.
2,desktop charger,Can only use with regular battery in battery compartment. Will not work with extended life battery.
4,Very good product for your Razr,"Overall it is a very good recharger. Having the space to charge an extra battery is a welcome addition.My only gripe is that the cradle doesn't have a tight fight when the razr is in place. I have a cover for my razr which makes it even less firmly fit. It would be good if it had some type of handle on the sides to make it hold still.Otherwise, it recharges fast and efficiently and having the screen that signals that charging is complete is a great help."
3,A bit disappointing,"Whilst the unit does what it claims, my Razr doesn't fit correctly in the cradle and the charge monitor is difficult to read and interpret."
5,very happy,Great for those who use their phone alot. Convenient and effective.I feel it was a worthwhile purchase and would buy again
3,Administrative Assistant,"This Twin Battery Desktop Charger + Ac Adapterworks, but half of the time when using it, I must keep adjusting the battery that is in the battery slot for it to work properly, and sometimes I must keep adusting the phone before it stars charging."
5,go get it,go pick this cd up get it its off da chain just like the rest of there music so get it !!!!!!
3,Three 6 Mafia + Fiend: good rap vs. c+rap,"Fiend kills what Three 6 did well with. He isn't too bad on ""Head Bussaz"" but he ruins most of the other material. Juicy's pitiful attempts at singing don't help either. In the end, it's Juice Man's rapping on about half the tracks and D.J. Paul that save it."
5,Worth the wait!,"This relatively unknown composer ranks with Mozart in both style and excellence. This is an outstanding disk, and well worth the wait for the special order. Highly recommended!"
1,Allsop CD Scratch-Repair Kit,"Used this product according to package directions on a CD that had a very minor surface scratch at the very beginning of the first track. I reapplied the product 2 more times and was still unable to get the CD to play correctly.I have been using Allsop products for years, this is my first disappointment with one of their products."
5,roller coasters-general,It give me more deep lifelong relationship with rooler coasters since I was 12 years of age(1982). Now I am 40 years of age. I will continue to keep roller coasters till my homegoing by the Lord.
5,Roller Coaster is a fun ride,"I read this story to a kindergarten class who really enjoyed it. One little boy listened with his two arms up ""roller coaster"" style imitating the twists and turns and ""Wheeeees"" throughout the book. A lively discussion occurred about whether the little girl should go on the coaster for a second ride. The writer/illustrator captures the intensity of feelings that we've all experienced on a roller coaster."
1,Awful,"With Robin Williams, I thought World's Greatest Dad would at least be funny. Instead, the first part of this film is vulgar and boring. Every other line features some perverted joke. I'm not sanctimonious - I don't object to curse words out of hand. However, the f-word is used so often that the dialogue becomes stilted and sounds phony. Who actually tells their father that they like looking at vaginas all day long.The film does pick up eventually - after 50 minutes, in a 90-minute film. Even then, it's not particularly funny - just amusing. Still not worth watching. I can't believe Robin Williams has come to this. What a sad end to a great comedic career."
2,World's greatest dad,"Awful, it had a lot of sexual reference and pornography suggestions, I'm so glad I got to see it before the kids would do it, I expected so much more from Robin Williams movies, I watch the theatrical rental several times, it appeared to be funny, but it wasn't at all."
2,"Boring, unfunny and painful to watch","This film is loaded with zero percent comedy, bad acting, bad writing and zero charm, heart and soul. Skip this movie, there's nothing good in it and it hardly qualifies as a good Robin Williams movie. While ""Bicential Man"" and ""Man of the year"" both sucked, they had heart soul and a few funny parts unlike this movie which has the except opposite. -2/10"
2,RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!,"I would suggest everyone renting this movie before actually buying it. As we were watching the movie, I was tempted several times to get up and turn it off. For my husband and I it was that bad. It was very strange and slow. Be warned there is a suicide in the movie. I didn't like it at all. My husband left the room. I would not my teenager watching this movie either. Just take my advise and rent it before you buy it. Wish I had done that."
2,Not what I expected-World's Greatest Dad,"This movie was not at all what I expected. It was supposed to be funny...not! I have seen so many Robin Williams movies, this one just doesn't cut the grade!"
1,Totally Disgusting,"Totally Disgusting!!Don't waste your time.......Another looser for WilliamsI can't believe I wasted 40 minutes watching this piece of trash. It is so vulgar!But finally when it even got to my husband I knew I was RIGHT :-) I am quoting him""Turn off this piece of trash"" and he stomachs almost anything plus he Loves Williams!If your into vulgarity and just plain immorality then this is your kind of movie.I did go to wikipedia just to read how it ends because we did not watch the entire movie (to be fair) with this reviewand when I read the ending............even that was so ridiculous I am so glad I did not wast another minute on this movieAlmost as bad as ""One Hour Photo"" Thumbs Down ''''''''''"
1,Anothe darko production,"Twisted plot, crude, weird, watch if you like films from darko productions. otherwise skip this. I personally did not find this movie appealing."
1,Comedy? Not even a little bit.,"I guess I learned my lesson the hard way - should have read the synopsis prior to watching this waste of 99 minutes. I did not laugh even one time during this ""comedy"". I was looking forward to seeing what I hoped would be another great performance by Robin Williams, who I am a big fan of. Not this time. This movie was gross and disturbing. I expected a comedy and this movie was nothing but disgusting sexual references one right after another.This movie is 100% NOT for kids - or adults for that matter. Don't bother.Glad I only paid $2.50 for this at a Blockbuster in my area that is closing - and that is still too expensive. World's Greatest Dad? More like World's Worst Movie!"
1,"Down, Then Up & Then Way Down","I barely made it through the first 30 minutes of the movie, then it took an interesting turn. But then it became a ""Hollywood"" predictable film until the end - but it was not worth it to watch the whole thing.Bobcat wrote and directed and there were a few highlights and unexpected turns, but overall this was a two dimensional film.No one liked Kyle Clayton for a reason - he was a jerk. Robin Williams - did you need a paycheck this bad? It looked like Robin wanted to jump out of his skin and tear this one up, but the material did not let him. An interesting concept for a short, not a feature."
3,Dark comedy,"Robin Williams pulls off a wonderful performance in this dark comedy and Daryl Sabara is great as the obnoxious son. The movie is not really feel good, or silly and is not for everyone. It is kind of a comedic-drama (ironic drama) without light heartedness. The story centers around an absurd situation the main character leads himself into and how it plays out."
1,Teen suicide not funny,This was supposed to be a comedy. Teen suicide is not a funny topic. The many attempts at humor based upon masterbation was juvenile at best. I expected more from a comedy starring Robin Williams
5,Brilliant dark comedy,"Very unusual dark comedy and definitely a refreshing departure from Robin Williams' normal work.This type of film may not be for everyone, but I think it's done masterfully, and any dark humor fan will certainly enjoy it."
2,I'm inpartial to this one...,"When I saw that I could rent this before it came out in the theaters I was very intriged. I purchased it for rent from my Tivo and 30 minutes later I started watching it. I really thought that since it was a Robin Williams movie it would be very good. And I can't say I hated it but it really wasn't what I thought it would be.The movie is somewhat dark and revovles around an unfortunate, accidental death that is used to revolve the story around. It's about using others misfortune for ones gain. It was an interesting movie, however its not the type of movie that I am used to seeing Robin Williams in.In the end, do I recommend seeing it? I do. But I would wait for it to be available on sale, it's one of those that is worth seeing if you can get it at a good deal, but not one where you should pay a premium to watch."
5,RIVETING. WILLIAMS IS BACK.,"It could be my Indian upbringing but for some reason I always feel at home when I watch Robin Williams. It could be the kindness in his eyes or the fragrance his happiness illuminates but he truly is a remarkable actor. In WGD, he does prove to me that even at 59, he remains one of the world's greatest actors.This film is for the morally tweaked, definitely not for those who live by calling everything mundane. It's funny, it's teary, it's funny, it is my film of the month. Do watch and share the word."
1,Misleading cover,I was excited to see this but you can't judge a movie by the cover. I was captured by Robin Williams and all the great headliners on the cover. But after watching the entire movie I found that none of the words applied. (for me)
1,"One of ""THE"" worst movies I've ever seen","I thought having Robin Williams (Which I'm a fan of his) in this movie might make it a decent view. It did not.None of the charactors were likable. I was actually happy when the future Rapist son died. Then the high school glorified the suicide.... Sorry Bobcat but when a student commits suicide the school ""Never"" glorifies it. When I was in school there was a student suicide and the kids weren't even allowed to excercise a minute of group silence in his honor.Robin Williams had to have done this movie as a favor to Bobcat.It's very dark, and the only highlight was Bruce Hornsby... Other than that I couldn't wait for it to end."
1,Aweful!,Horrible movie not a comedy ...don't bother! Don't know why its even in the comedy category :( I got about an hour into it and couldent stand to watch the rest ... kept hoping it would get better but never did :(
1,Waste of 1 hr 39 minutes,"I have never rated and written a movie review before, but this movie was just that GOD AWFUL! You'll never get this time back. Save yourself the trouble and spend it doing something else!"
1,An abomination,"Robin Williams, what were you thinking? This film goes way beyond unfunny to disgusting. I cannot remember a film worse than this in several years. Williams hasn't made a good movie in years and I will avoid his films in the future. I will try to find time to visit Bobcat at the mental hospital in which he resides (or should reside}!"
1,Hang and Chop,This was a bad choice on Robin Williams part to take on this movie. It was so bad my husband and I actually threw away the dvd knowing we never wanted to see it again and to make sure our son would never get his hands on it to watch. It's that bad! Two thumbs down!!
1,A Shame,"I am a big fan of Robin Williams, but ""World's Greatest Dad"" is not very good. It's hard to even call it a comedy. This really just was not a good role for Robin Williams.After I watched this film, I thought ""it's too bad Robin Williams was even in this film"". Let me assure you, Robin Williams can do much better then this."
1,OMG,"OMG! Don't waste your money, I spent a dollar to rent it and that was the worst dollar I ever spent. This is a horrible movie. the only think funny is that they call it a comedy. I rented it because my husband likes Robin Williams and I figured even though it was not a well known movie I would get it anyway because it starred him. I was so disappointed in him. I can't believe that he would play in a movie like this, morbid humor. I'm thinking, ""Did he even read the script before?"" Maybe I just didn't get it? Well don't just rent/buy it because it has Robin Williams in it...Save your money for something you will enjoy more, like maybe dental work....LOL"
1,Too Bad I Can't Give It Zero Stars,"The description of this movie is false advertising. It is not a comedy. The teenage son accidentally kills himself in a most shameful way and the dad character (Robin Williams) is the first to find him. If there is a joke or two peppered amongst the horror, I'm sure I missed it.I am sincerely concerned about the writers, producers and stars of this movie. They cannot be emotionally stable. Please don't subject yourself to this movie."
4,interesting,"Don't go into this movie expecting a light-hearted comedyI enjoyed it. I found the characters to be very human and real in regards to their shortcomings. I tend to enjoy Robin William movies where he restrains his manic energy and actually ""acts"" and this is definitely one of them.It is the kind of movie that will stay with you for awhile, afterward. The ending is a bit abrupt but I still strongly recommend it."
5,World's Greatest Dad = World's Greatest Film,"As I life long fan of Robin Williams, I have seen every movie he has performed in and in my opinion, this film delivers his best performance. In this black comedy, the themes of tragedy are explored and how people react to the unexpected death of a person they may have hated or even not have know. The range of William's emotional performance will made me laugh, then cry, and then some how laugh again. This film does something I have never seen before and that is to take the viewer to the darkest depth of parental tragedy and bring comedy back. Bobcat wrote and directed an amazing film and the use of music allows the scenes to dig deep into your heart. Also, Daryl Sabara gives an amazing performance as William's son. Do yourself a favor, buy the movie if you like your comedy a little dark, because you'll want to watch it again and again (soundtrack too!)."
2,Double tape of big band musicals - tame.,"CHANGE OF HEART - new title for HIT PARADE OF 1943 - is a typical ""song writers attempt to get a hit"" plot with a few twists. Publisher John Carroll steals songwriter Susan Hayward's work and publishes it as his own. She romances as she plots revenge. Lots of numbers competently done but nothing impresses. Hayward is marvelous in tongue-in-cheek performance and Eve Arden delivers her usual acid performance. Oscar Nom for Scoring. It passes the time."
5,Great stuff!,"Terrific prose about a modern day Tchichikov (a la Gogol) called Snopes and how he brow beats his way into the small village of Frenchmen's Bend. The movie ""The Long Hot Summer"" with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, was loosely based on this book. Check it out."
2,Page upon page of unintelligible gibberish,"I think the people who revere Faulkner so much are either suffering from mass hysteria, or have bought into this ""Faulkner is God"" myth and don't have the intellectual integrity to admit that he's nothing more than a good writer who frequently littered his prose with unintelligible gibberish. It must have become fashionable in literary circles at one point to praise Faulkner, and since then people have become afraid to appear uninformed and announce that the EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES.This book, just like _The Sound and the Fury_, is bursting with pages of prose where you just cannot tell what is going on. Long confusing sentences that wind up meaning nothing, plot holes large enough to drive a truck through with not even a feeble attempt at logical explanation, and on and on.Come now, honest fans of literature. Repeat after me. Faulkner was an overrated hack."
2,Not a bobble head,"Despite ""bobble head"" being on the box, this is rather a bobble body. I know it's not a big difference, but I wanted it to be a bobble HEAD."
2,Great Accessory for Many Illusions,"This isn't a magic trick by itself, but it really makes a lot of other tricks look more professional. The soft surface makes some moves a lot easier, too.This closeup pad is like a giant mouse pad. It has rubber backing with a soft cloth top that doesn't snag. It seems pretty durable and I'm looking forward to many years working with it. 12x17 didn't sound very big, but it is! I did a few tricks on it like coin matrix and cups and balls and found it nice and spacious. Cards fan like a dream on it! I even dropped a half dollar from a foot above it and it deadened the sound nicely. This is a keeper!Update - 2012 From five stars to two...Ok, it's not so much of a keeper. After a year of rolling and unrolling it for storage and transport, the soft facing came completely off the rubber backing. I've switched to a couple pieces of felt spray-glued together, and it has been just as good and far more durable. This magic pad worked fine for awhile, then just fell apart."
1,Worst purchase decision ever!!!,"When I got this product I thought it was great! It is a very soft mat and the perfect size. It lasted literally 45 seconds!!! I turned it over to inspect the bottom of the pad, when I flipped it back to the performance surface face up I noticed that there was a fray at the end of the mat. I touched the fray and the entire op surface peeled away. The glue that they use to hold down the felt on top is HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money on this!!!"
4,The Bowery as it Was Then,"This film must have made a big impact in its time. I recall a documentary around 1953 about Chicago's Madison Ave, its ""dirty backyard"" if I remember accurately. On the Bowery is better, a slice of life among the alcoholics, mostly men, who existed in that time and place. I would like to have seen someone going to AA. It's been around since 1935 and must have had meetings on the Bowery. The church meeting in the film comes the closest to this. On the Bowery is a trip back into the past, to a NYC that I never saw. I bought the DVD from Amazon.com."
4,Wonderful camera,I am absolutely happy after buying this product. I was planning to buy this product for long time as I did lot of research before buying this one.I already own Panasonic FZ30 and Canon A610. I wanted one more camera to gift to my brother. It is best point shoot camera and with lot of features.I would definitly recommend others to buy( now A630 is there in the market).I wanted a black color but I think only silver is availableI also recently bought Canon S3 IS which is also very good.
4,Love my camera!!,"I used it for 4 years straight, worked like a charm, but after I dropped in the Beach.. the Canon Customer service could not bring it back to life. Took many great pics of my kids as well as for my blog. Would highly recommend it!"
3,BEWARE LENS MALFUNCTION!,"I bought this camera on 6/2/06 and loved it,until today. I was taking pictures of my grandson when the lens began to malfunction. It makes a horrible grinding noise when you turn it on or off and the lens has trouble extending and retracting. I called Canon and it must be shipped to them to be repaired. They only have one service location in the U.S. and they cannot estimate how long it will take. I have to ship it via UPS or Fed Ex and must insure it. I am NOT happy NOW! Someone else eluded to this problem, so heed their advice and BEWARE!"
5,Thank you Amazon reviewers,"I almost purchased another camera that I saw on sale, but I decided to browse and spend a bit more. This is the camera I ended up with (after reading so many positive reviews).The camera takes 4 AA batteries, but the battery life seems really good. I have already taken over 200 pictures with the same batteries. The results that I have gotten are every bit as good as the sample pics on Amazon (if not better). The flipping LCD screen is also nice so I can protect the screen.My only complaint is the limited zoom. It's very difficult to take pictures of small things (bugs, birds) at a distance.Im 100 percent happy with this camera. Without any lessons I am taking professional quality pictures and its very easy."
5,I LOVE my A620!,"This is a fabulous camera! The first thing I noticed about it was how fast it was compared to my old 3.2 mp Sony. The second thing I noticed after I snapped a few shots was how crisp, clear and beautiful the picture were. The colors are amazing, the macro is great and the zoom is impressive. I love how the LCD screen swivels out, it comes in handy. I'm a beginning photographer so the first few weeks I had the camera I mostly used the automatic settings while I read up on shutter speed and aperture etc. Now I'm starting to use the manual settings and make adjustments myself. It's a good camera to grow with. I did get a bigger memory card - the 32 MB card it comes with is pretty useless. I also bought rechargeable batteries and always carry spares in my camera bag. I highly recommend the Canon Powershot A620 - I absolutely love mine!* see my photos above under ""customer images"""
1,Disappointment,"After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality. I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a ""snap shot"" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me. However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout. After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR."
5,The Powershot A620 is great,I particular enjoy the underwater mode that filter out the blue. Of course it has to be used with a waterproof housing.
4,Great Value.....but don't pay too much,"I bought this camera a few years ago, and it has been a great camera. Extremely durable and simple to use. When I bought it, I was just looking for a camera that took quality pictures, and this does the trick. I bought this for around $[...], so I'm not sure why the price is so high now."
4,a little big but great for amateur and pro photos.,"This really was a good buy, I can use this for family reunion on a sunday afternoon,or i can use it on the studio at manual nd the resuls are always great."
2,Not very impressed at all!!!!,"This camera takes decent pictures half of the time, the rest suck!! The colors are off, people look darker then they are. Maybe the flash is not strong enough. I have seen pictures from 4 different occasions, mostly indoor, and 1/3 to 1/2 of the pictures come out right. It has an impressive list of features and I really like the design. I did a lot of research before getting it and looked at all the pictures online, but I am not very satisfied with it. I have used a Kodak, Olympus and a Nikon in the past and liked the picture quality on all of them, but the pictures from this camera do not come close to the other ones."
4,"Good camera, weird transaction",The camera itself is great but the exchange I had to deal with wtih Adorama was beyond bizarre. After the shutter broke I had to send it back to the company and they told me that I;d not have to pay shipping again but then charged me for it. I'm still sorting out the details.
2,Not very good,"OK, I've spent years using a nice film camera -- solid body, good, interchangeable lenses, etc. -- so maybe I'm biased, but this camera just doesn't do it for me.For starters, the thing had to go straight from the box to the canon repair center (on my dime natch, as my wife purchased the camera several months before as a birthday present so there was no option to return it to the store once my birthday rolled around, and canon did not offer to pick up the shipping): the image was blurry and overexposed.Now that I have it back from the shop, here's my beefs: a) the viewfinder is atrocious -- only the center of the image in the viewfinder is in focus, with the rest being a blurry mess. b) Pictures are still a little blurry, even at maximum resolution. c) The supplied software doesn't have much to recommend; just a very basic image downloading/viewing program along with a program to stitch images together."
4,Powershot,This is a great model! I use it for both vacations and work. It has many features that you would actually use. If you are looking for a very slim camera this isn't the thinnest you'll find because it does take batteries. I personally find a camera that has some place to hold it is better for shots and comfort. Overall it is a great deal and a great cannon product. I love it!
5,Best value for the money,"Amazing. 7.1 megapixel camera from Canon for just a hair over $200 - including shipping. It works great. Has lots of features. Many different options for photo quality. Also, the video mode is much better than my HP digital camera. It shoots just over 8 minutes/gigabyte. Three other modes sacifice quality but give longer shooting time. Includes a cord to plug into pc and one to plug into front of vcr to view video and photos on your tv. Software is user friendly and helps organize photos. Also includes a function where it automatically converts large photos to 600X800 pixes for email. I get tired of resizing photos that I want to email. The flip screen is great for holding the camera high or low and still be able to see where it's pointing. Thanks Canon and Amazon.I have no complaints."
5,Outstanding camera,"I purchased an A95 a couple of years ago and was very pleased with the quality of the pictures. Since the price was right, I decided to upgrade after reading excellent reviews for the camera. I have used the camera for about a month and have been very pleased with the results. The pictures are very sharp and the movie mode has greatly improved. I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants a very high quality camera at a budget price."
3,Images Not Accurate On Screen,"I am extremely impressed with all but one feature of this camera. When the image looks cropped perfectly on the back of the camera, the pictures often come back with the top of heads cut off, etc. The view finder is more accurate. I'm not sure why both can't present an accurate image, but it took me a month to get pictures that were as I had wanted."
5,"Jack of all trades, Master of all.","This is truly the master of all trades. 7.1 megapixels is really as good as it gets by todays standards. The only other camera that beats this one is the Canon S2 IS with its 12x zoom, but even that camera doesn't have 7.1 megapixels, and is quite bulky (trust me). Canon really locked it down with the swivel LCD, which was a life saver while taking photos at a concert. I used a 2GB Ultra II SD card with it for hi-res photos and movies, and the camera worked wonders.I have one or two very minor gripes with this camera.. but you'll realize that this was the only way the camera was sub $400.- The red-eye is an issue- Wish it had optical instead of digital zoom in movie mode- I wish Canon would switch to Mpeg4 instead of AVI for movie mode (Better Compression)I think its safe to declare that Canon is the digital camera king."
4,Second Digital Camera,"I bought this camera as a second camera for our vacation to the Grand Canyon. The camera performed exceptionally. The picture quality is unbelievable. I store photos from both cameras on my laptop and it is very easy to distinguish which pictures are from the new camera.The only concern that I have with this camera is that it must be held very still to get a good photo. Pictures from moving vehicles or those quickly taken do not come out at all.The auto flash is a little flaky, but this problem may be operator error on my part in not taking the time to really study the manuals. Overall this is very good camera at a very good price."
3,Canon Di9gital Camera,"The camera has many features, perhaps too many for my purposes. The viewing screen could be larger. I would prefer a camera that is less bulky or cumbersome. After purchasing through Amazon a local retailer advertised the same camera at the same price."
1,Canon Powershot A620 7.1mp Digital Camera,"This camera is great, it zooms, it remembers, it changes image colors. A Igig sd card is huge, a 2gig card would be something else. I bought this new with a 1gb KIT, which in essence offers everything from SDCard to bag, to tripod to rechargable battery system, and it uses AAs not some $100 battery. The focal plane is something like 1/3 of an inch to infinity. I recommend this camera highly. Happy Photographing!"
2,Shutter Stuck Open,Probably a good camera. The one I rec'd shutter was defective. Returned it and bought the Canon A540 - very pleased so far with this camera for less $[...].
1,A620 review,"We have a small photo business at the beach and needed a small point and shoot camera to always have at hand. The A620 is used to back up our older G5 and the new Rebel XT. It is easy and quick to operate and yeilds a high quality image. Overall, a great, easy to operate little camera for the money."
5,Canon Powershot A620 7.1 MP Digital Camera,"This is my first digital camera, and I am really satisfied with this purchase. I used the camera in my recent vacation in Mexico, and it was very easy to use (point and shoot), and gave excellent quality photos.I really recomend this camera."
5,Awesome Camera!,"I have been really impressed with this camera. The Turnable screen is great! The pictures come out clear, and red eye is never a problem."
3,was great for awhile,"I loved this camera, especially the flippy lens, but now it says all batteries are dead, even brand new ones. This makes it useless. Even if it does say let the batteries work, they drain and it is useless within an hour."
3,Didn't Last Long!,"Do not buy this camera for $699.00! I bought it about 2 years ago for around $250-$260 or so and the sensor just up and died a few months ago! It was a pretty nice camera while it lasted, but 2 years is disappointing for longevity. I'm seeing that more and more with the newer point and shoot cameras. It's hard to know what to buy as they don't seem to last very long. We have an older Olympus Sylus 2.1 MP that we got in early 2001 and it's still working fine. You can buy several other cameras for less with just as good, if not better, features and image quality. Shop around and do some research!"
5,People!!!! Do Not Buy This $300 Camera For $700!!!!!!!,"I have an a620 I bought in January, 2006 and paid approx $325 dollars for it even way back then. Anybody who would spend this price ($699) for the a620 obviously has no idea of the real price of cameras are on the market, and would be taken big time on this one. Google in the a620 and you will see the real price of this camera.You can buy the Canon Digital Rebel XSi SLR 12 mega pixel camera for a lot less than this point and shoot camera....Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black). The a620 is a great camera at 7.1 mega pixels, but it isn't worth no $700. (Unless you just don't care what you spend) Don't be taken!! I've seen nothing that tells me that there are optional accessories included on the a620."
1,Don't Waste Your Money - a Sheer Disappointment!,"This camera was so inconsistent. Sometimes it would take good pictures, other times, photos were blurry. The flash, as another reviewer pointed out, is way too bright and washes out photos. I always had to turn it off. I say ""had,"" as now the LCD monitor has gone kerfluey, and it will cost half the price of the camera to fix it. Suffice it to say I will not be buying another Canon camera!"
4,I hope this helps old and new users.,"Before I bought my camera, I downloaded the manual from the Canon web site.The 7.1-mega pixels allow me to take pictures of pages from books and magazines at the local library. It also allow me to zoom and crop pictures at the local drug store.The flip able LCD screen is useful to take pictures at odd angles. I needed to take pictures of my water pump in the engine compartment of my car.The focusing square stays in the middle when the camera is in ""P"" mode. When I'm taking a picture of an hard to focus scene, I ""auto focus"" the camera by pressing the shutter half way. Keeping the shutter half way, I frame the picture. I take the picture by pressing the shutter fully.My start-up picture has my name in it. Every time you turn the camera on, it will flash my name.The movie mode allows me to show my boss..... my stuff works.I don't like the naming convention Canon uses to store its files."
5,Excellent Deal,"This Camera take a good looking pictures. I still having problems to take some night pictures, but it seen that some adjustment to the pictures properties are required to take this king of pictures. You have to read the manually carefully and made some test before you launch to take good pictures seriously. This is really a good choice if you are looking a medium level camera that take great pictures in several environments."
5,Canon Powershot A620 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom-User review,"The camera provides excellent feature,great image quality, and reasonable price. I bought the camera one month ago. The ease-of-use and fast operation make it a very competent midsized camera for beginners. I have not explored all its functions at different photographic situations,but till now everything is ok and I have nothing to complain about it. Based on those excellent features, I think it is a very successful digital camera."
1,Fatally flawed design ruins good product,"Seemed like a very fine camera until we discovered the UGLY truth. A Google search reveals Canon is/was the subject of a class action suit for this very problem.Any interference with the action of the zoom lens renders the camera inoperable. It must be returned to Canon for repairs. To their credit, they did repair our camera no charge in about 2-3 weeks. If I had known this product was a fragile as an empty eggshell, I would have never purchased it. Caveat emptor, or ""we reserve the right to take advantage of the weak, the stupid, and the ignorant. If you want trust...buy a dog"""
5,Way more than a entry point - Probably best value by now,"When it comes to cameras (same for other gadgets), you always have to choose between price and quality or between size and function, so it's really great when you find that special ones don't compromise any characteristic.That is this camera! is not as expensive (below US250!) and have very good specs (7.1 Mp, 4X optical zoom, 2 inch vari-angle display), is not as big (perfect size for the hand) but have a lot of features (20 shooting modes!). Besides, if you are a newbie and too many options scare you, the AUTO mode and the basic modes are so ""point and shoot"" and take so great pictures that you'll think you suddenly become a better photographer.Thumbs up Canon!"
1,Disappointed,"The camera is great - no complaints there, but the purchase included a promotion of a free 512 memory card WHICH I did not receive. Too bad for the false advertising."
1,horrible,"this movie is a joke, seriously I couldnt stop laughing the entire time. poorly made, bad acting. just awful."
4,Gorgeous Faucet,"This faucet is gorgeous: very aesthetically pleasing. The design is classic and traditional, but the finish makes the fixture look modern and classy. The faucet itself is rather large, so I would recommend not installing it on a very small sink. Installation itself is simple -- it comes with instructions and looks compatible with most standard sink setups.Functions smoothly; water pressure is great. The surface is shiny but not reflective and does not get dirty too easily.Overall, a very lovely addition to any washroom."
3,That's a quite nice album!,"Firstly the correct name of this album is ""Sob O Sol de Parador"", by Lobao e os Presidentes. A full hard rock album by one of the most well known musicians of Brazilian rock. All lyrics are in portuguese and the best track is undoubtely ""E O Vento Levou"", with great guitar sound. If you don't know this guy yet, try this cd and you'll be not disappointed! And if you like it then listen to his greatest albums ""E O Rock Errou"" and ""Vida Bandida""."
1,Battery Life Is Poor on Standby,"With the radio left solely in the standby mode, the life of the battery was less than 12 hours. You are better off using standard AA/AAA Alkaline Batteries for the radio as they provide longer life."
3,"Works well, but needs a carbide bit","This is a great template, adjustable for a wide array of hinge sizes and door thicknesses. I replaced 12 doors in my house and it cut accurate mortises every time.The downside is the included bit. It lasted for only 3 doors before it started smoking. I bought a Milescraft carbide hinge mortising bit (with bearing) for $10 to replace the Porter Cable bit."
1,Plastic Parts Break Easily,"The jig broke the first time I adjusted the hinge size. The small plastic teeth which hold the gauge in the slot broke clean off one minute after I took the jig out of the package. Twenty seconds later it was in the garbage. Buy something made of metal. It looked like a 50 cent tool, and performed like it."
4,Does the job,"I didn't have the problems as some of the others, maybe the template was slightly improved. But for the price it does what it's asked to do. If you hang doors for a living this isn't a tool to consider. I have used it on about 30 doors and with several different types of hinges and it worked everytime. The only draw back I had and knew from the start would be to keep track of those darn little duplex nails. I improvised and made my own way to fasten it to the door.For those complaining about it being made out of plastic, hey, you get what you pay for. If you want a professional hinge template you will be spending upwards of $200+ bucks."
2,Jig needs to be modified,This product probably works really well when installing a new door in a new frame. It does not work well installing a new door into a frame with existing hinges on it. The stops to adjust for the door thickness were off by 1/8th of an inch. this cost me a new door. and the place to nail it into the door are off so I had to drill new holes. After making the modifications ( and another door) it worked really well. I liked the fact that it came with it's own router bit and the adjustment for the hinge size is really cool. The double headed nails helped a lot when pulling it off.
3,"Simple to use, lousy router bit","Versatile enough for run of the mill hinges, although a more stable attachment to door wouldn't hurt. The supplied router bit of lousy quality."
4,Great little tool,"It's all plastic, but covers every type of door hinge and jamb, and even comes with a pretty decent bit.Just squeeze in the two plastic guide sides and slide up or down to the marked size of hinge you want( its marked on the template) and your ready to put set your depth for your router bit. and then it's time to route out your hinge. To set your depth just insert the router bit into your router, and place your template over the bit, then lay your hinge beside the bit and raise or lower you router depth gauge until they match)The two corners (If you don't want them round) must be cut square, and that's just a very little bit that could even be done with a razor knife. Very east and simple. These are being discoutinued, so better buy quick, Lowes is even selling them for under $19.It took me about 12 minutes to read the instructions, and about a minute and a half to set it all up."
3,Does the Job. . . .but,"Overall I was able to make the jig work, but more flexibility/adjustment in the hinge depth would be a huge asset. I was refitting 12 doors on a renovation and the hinges were not set back as far as the Porter Cable Unit had them by default. Using there default location would have meant I would have had to move the stops on every door frame to accommodate the jig. The solution was simple; I just added a shim to decrease the hinge depth.The nail hold down for the template is weak at best. I drilled a separate hole in the template frame and went to screws. The router would cause the frame to shift at times using the nails.Overall the frame is great for quick and dirty short run jobs. If you do doors from time to time, consider the more expensive jigs."
3,D'oh!,"This probably isn't the kind of review Amazon expects. The product is packaged well and looks to be a nice tool, but I've yet to use it as I've figured out a decent work-around. And, as always, Amazon delivered as advertised.Since I havent used it I can't really rate it, but I gave it three stars because it's a neutral number.Anyway, the work-around: I realized while the product was in-transit I could make a guide using a hole saw, particle board, a sabre saw and a file. It took about 20 min to make the guide, including test cuts. I use a collar (something like this:Porter-Cable 42036 3/8-Inch O.D. Template Guide) to follow the guide's profile with the router. It's a dedicated tool, but it's cheap and you can make many of them for different applications as you need them."
1,WARNING: Design changed!,"This used to be a great little product. I had an old one that worked just fine until I broke it by accident. But when I bought a new one, I couldn't believe what they'd done - they've switched out the double-head nails for flat heads and there are no guide bushings like before. AND, the new flathead nails just barely clear the template thickness; nowhere near enough bite to hold it to the jamb while routing! How many thousandths of a cent did they save with this with this blockhead move? Rule #1: if it ain't broke, DON'T FIX IT."
2,Porter Cable Door Hinge Template - Wouldn't Recommend,"I have 5 doors to install. I did one and this template and bit are not going to make it all the way.1) Flimsy tabs on the insert pieces. It's just a matter of time before they break.2) The insert pieces don't sit flush in the template. They stick up 1/8"". It makes your router base ride against the two inserts that stick up. At the two edges of the cut your 6"" router base will ""fall"" off the insert pieces and cause a gouge in the wood. You need to buy a larger router base so this doesn't happen.3) Poor instructions4) Bit wears out quicklyI don't expect this type of product from Porter Cable. I am going to return it."
3,"Template worked good, Enclosed Router Bit Poor","When ordering the template, order a carbide router bit. I made two practice cuts and wore the bit out before I made the actual mortise."
1,down the tubes,The later and not so great model. The old model would do the job. the new one is crap. better to make your own if you have the time otherwise buy something else. Home Depot don't even sell them any more. I tried two with unaceptical results took them back to lowes.
4,Good Jig,"Being a contractor and having installed over 100 doors over the years, this jig has saved me hrs and hrs of time. Just need to calibrate depth of router, test on scrap piece of wood, and your ready to go. Have tried all different kinds of jig on the market, but find this one the best and easiest to use. The object here is to use 3 1/2"" hinges with the rounded corners, this will match the exact profile of the jig. No chiseling required. The only downside of this product is it's made out of plastic, over time and use, the adjustable bracket can break."
2,Not the historical romance Julia Quinn,"I think the author for this book and Birthright are the same. But definitely not the same author that writes the historical romances (Viscount Who Loved Me etc.) Not the best book, but I was never a big fan of Silhouette romances. The only reason I bought this one was because I thought it was the other Julia. A nice easy read for a lazy day, but nothing earth shattering. I recommend this book only if you have run out of options and need a book to pass the time."
4,Like it but a bit outdated,Will use this for a resource for friends that are beginning paper crafts. It is nicely done. Tweety Jill is a favorite artist of mine
3,Very informative source for info on fugitive slaves,"I used this book as the basis for my book on my book analysis for AP American History, and it helped. The book was a little difficult to read because of the large number of examples put into the text, but besides that, it waas put together into well defined sections and was very useful."
5,Just what I needed,"My dermatologist proscribed a hand salve that smelled like creosote, and I need something to wear at night to keep from getting the stuff all over the bed.These gloves were perfect.They are about the cheapest-looking, poorly made things you can imagine. No two are exactly the same size, and they are full of strings and dropped stitches.Still, if you want something reasonably soft, disposable, natural fabric (I assume), and cheap, these are just the ticket."
1,Gloves for dwarfs.,"I bought these gloves without any illusions that I am getting quality product - just needed disposable gloves for one time use. Got 3 packs ""Men's Size"" - barely good for my wife and onepack ""Women's size"" good for my 10 year old. What am I going to have??Good side - worth this one star is learning experience - I never suspected that pigmy tribes in Africa are manufacturing gloves."
3,Thin white gloves,I ordered a box of white gloves and they were just that. I haven't gotten a chance to use it for the purpose i need but it came in a timely manner.
5,An affordable factory part,I always prefer to buy original replacement parts and this pad fits and works perfectly. I use it for sanding with and without the vacuum attachment. I will buy another as a spare and one without holes for use with buffing/polishing pads.
4,Holy Moly,I have had my Porter Cable orbital saw for 10 years and just had to replace the sanding pad. This new one is a tad softer than the previous and seems to work fine.
3,"Good steamer, not great with rice","I purchased this product because I wanted a better way of making rice that using a stove-top method but knew I didn't have the money yet for a decent rice cooker.If you are looking for a rice cooker, save your money and buy a decent one. Cooking times vary widely between the type of rice you use and the wattage of your microwave. It took about 5 or 6 times to get good results but it using it is still an uneven affair.But, if you are looking for a great microwave steamer, the product really is worthwhile. Again, a little trail and error is needed but I found it to be an excellent steamer for vegetables and a great way to make popcorn without oil."
4,Good value.,"If you are terrible at making rice as I am, this is a very helpful product. The liquid tends to boil over if cooked at high temp in my microwave. I cook the rice at 50% power for about 50% longer than the directions recommend and it comes out perfectly. Easy clean up in the dishwasher. It is a bit of a pain to store, but I'd buy it again. Also comes with a steamer insert for cooking vegetables, etc. but I haven't tried that yet."
5,works for brown rice,I live at a 7000 foot elevation and have a hard time cooking brown rice in any expedient way. My rice cooker takes well over an hour. This product really gets my stamp of approval. The proportion recommended for brown rice to water is correct; the time says 15-20 minutes; 25 minutes was perfect in my apartment-sized microwave. The rice is tender with a nice resistance. Thanks to all the other reviewers who were my impetus to try it!
3,All right,"I was disappointed with this item. It's acceptable for cooking small amounts. When I followed the directions (regarding amounts), the rice was hard and dry in the middle. With popcorn it starts to burn in the middle before all the kernels are popped. Pasta turned out okay. If I just cook a small amount of rice (1/4 cup dry), it comes out okay."
2,Not as good as it should be,"We love using the microwave for rice - not faster, but simple, easy to clean, leaves the stove top free for other dinner preparations. BUT this version is not a good choice. The two-part top leaves a layer of boiling water when you take it out. The plastic pot gets a little soft and flexible. And finally, it breaks easily when it falls to the ground. Oops. Different one next, hopefully like our old faithful from Chinatown that lasted for years."
1,Makes a mess,"I had an old microwaveable rice cooker that worked well, it broke, so I purchased this one. I have used it a couple times now and every time it makes a mess in the microwave. The plastic gets hot and loses its tight seal and water leaks everywhere. The rice comes out perfect, but the mess is not worth it."
4,Good product,"Useful gadget, especially for young cooks. Easy to use and clean, less messy than traditional stove-top pan."
4,"Helps Me Eat More Healthily, Every Day","Saying it's a 'four in one' is a bit of a stretch when one of the 'four' is a spoon, and another is a different lid, but that's a small gripe.This makes rice, popcorn and steamed vegetables quick and hassle-free. I can steam a tiny batch of veggie for lunch for me and two small kids and know they'll come out great. I can make a big batch of brown rice faster and better than I ever could in a pot.I agree with another reviewer who questioned some of the design (three tiny feet that make it a bit unstable, no way to remove the steamer inner lid or pull out the basket without the danger of getting burned), but I still love this thing. In fact I'm buying my second (after dropping my first from a great height and breaking off one of the feet. My fault!)"
1,It should be called - NonArena,"Time again to counter the perfect reviews for the Justice Department.Another prime example of ""We have to pad out the film with 95% of something (nothing), because mostly it's not about the title.""One fight at start, one at end = 2 whole aliens in battle with 2 humans!!I was a fool to have this immaculate vision it would involve the 75 animatronic/masked aliens in a UWF - Universe Wrestling Federation. I think 4 or so were animatronic, the rest were Lost in Space series face paint.I understand the emotional can cover any film with enjoyment but I am emotionally handicapped so therefore am cursed to have the highest standard. And I'm not 12 years oldArena is NonNirvana."
1,Trouble Causer,"This is the biggest inflammatory, hateful, and divisive collection of nastiness I have ever had the misfortune to have in my hands. The youth of America, beware! Do not take this piece self-loathing, propoganda to heart in your classrooms! Administrations...do not let this book be part of your curriculum, it is poisonous and dangerous.I wouldn't even give it one star given the choice."
1,Not just about cowboys and indians...,"For better or worse, America has been for most of its history wedded to various forms of Christianity and Judaism. The American frontier was not just one of cowboys and indians (as this author's selections would have us believe) but also one of Presbyterians and Jesuits. Jesuits as indians and Cowboys as Presbyterians is the kind of truth that is unacceptable to this liberal, revisionist author. Don't pay too much attention to this book if u get stuck with it in a college course. Skip it if u can."
2,Easy enough to install but squeals soon after install,"This belt is solid and appears to be built well but after only having this installed for a couple days it started squealing. I've tried tightening the tensioner, loosening the tensioner and applying belt dressing and still it squeals. I think the surface coating or the material the belt is made out of is just not as well made to grip the pulleys or as pliable as the stock belts. I was warned on the Altima forums that I should avoid these belts and spend the extra cash on the Goodyear Gatorback belts and now I know why. I would not recommend these over something better like the Gatorback belts but they will work for a DIYer on a tight budget."
2,It's ok,The item works fine... until someone tries to pull it apart. It can be pulled apart and broken with bare hands (as I discovered when someone tried to steal my bike).
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased this lock and made sure to lock the bike properly, securing it around the tires and the frame itself. But when I returned shortly after from the first time using it, the bike and lock were gone. Excellent waste of money."
1,Broke Fast,"The lock seemed really good for the money, but after a month of light use, the casing pulled out while I was stretching the cord. This means that unless I really fiddle with it, the hole that the lock goes into DOES NOT LINE UP with the plastic casing.So really, it's a cheap product. It should not break when uncoiling!"
2,IT LOCKS BUT IS IT STURDY ENOUGH?,"I LIVE IN A CITY THAT HAS A HIGH BIKE-THEFT RATE. THE LOCK LOOKED STURDY IN PICTURES ON THE WEB AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT, BUT I COULD CHEW THROUGH THIS SUCKER WITH MY TEETH. RETURNING IT COST AS MUCH AS THE LOCK. SO I USE IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MUCH STURDIER LOCK."
5,Does the job well,"As long as you don't forget your key this is a quick, easy, very solid product. Like any lock, it could be cut by any thief...but I am just trying to keep the honest people honest."
3,Get a safer lock for your bike,"It was okay to use, but my bike got stolen so this is probably easy to cut off. If you have an expensive bike, don't risk getting this lock."
4,"A Good Mix of that ""New Sound""","I didn't know what to expect of this mix since I live in Europe and I'm not really saturated with all the MTV Indie. So I gave it a listen and found a few bands that I really enjoyed. It was a nice suprise to hear Intl. Noise Conspiracy (fronted by the former singer of Refused) and I think I found my new favorite band (Yeah Yeah Yeahs.) Other notables are The Hives and The Von Bondies.Overall I think it's a varied mix of decent talents. Few of these groups will stand strong in the mainstream, but is that really a bad thing?"
3,"Good, But Incomplete","I like Johnson's books--they are good vehicles for the lay person to navigate the complexities of archetypal psychology. This book presents a psycholotgical/cultural interpretation of the Dionysus muths in a simple, direct, and usually-insightful manner.The author sometimes uses too-broad strokes, trotting out wild generalizations about cultural phenomena that seem a little too superficial, a little too pat to be wholly convincing.Also, if you are looking for a *practical* book, this probably isn't it. The chapter on using the Dionysus myth in your own life is woefully thin, which the author admits right off the bat. In fact, he refers you to his earlier book, Inner Works, for a more detailed, specific method of practical applications. That said, Johnson's thin volumes (this one is about 90 pages), really need to be read and used in conjunction with that book."
2,Disappointment,I read everything i can to better understand the human psyche. This one was a superficial stretch.
1,"Condescending towards psychology, religion, and spirituality","Having to read this book for a Mysticism class I was appalled at the irresponsible and totally inacurate information slanderously thrown together. This book pastes Dionisus into any form utilizing kindergarden techniques. The author claims to have spoken with Dr. C. G. Jung, but his lack of knowledge suggests strongly that he has only glanced at Jung's collected works. Ecstacy is an insult to any educated person in the ways of psychology, religion, pagan philosophies, inner spirituality and growth. Personally, it should be removed from all bookstores and book outlets as it is a pathetic excuse for writing. In short, do not read this book."
3,A good starting point,This book is a good starting point for someone desiring to learn SEM in Lisrel. Theoretical/statistical concepts have been explained in a simple manner and explanation of Lisrel is thorough. Useful as a course book. Not a good book if you already know SEM and are looking for in-depth understanding.
3,The book has some appeal.,"About 20 years ago, I carried out a number of projects involving analysis of SEM models with LISREL7. The syntax of this language does not differ much from that of LISREL8. In this regard, I did not benefit much from the book by B.Byrne. However, I do not regret having bought it.The style of the book is prolix. Virtually all the topics discussed in the book are included in the LISREL8 and PRELIS2 users' guides by K.Joreskog and D.Sorbom. The presentation of material is much more compact in the manuals than in the book. In my opinion, this more concise presentation is better and a reader can assimilate easier relevant information.I believe that the approach adopted by the author can appeal to many readers. A positive feature is an extensive list of references related to various disciplines, including: business, education, marketing, medicine and sociology. The SIMPLIS command language is described much more extensively in the book than in the manuals."
2,Big Tool Set for kids,"For the price, I was not impressed. I don't think the toy was made with a ""real"" little boy in mind. Everything was too light weight, and I don't think it's going to last.Also, it boasted of batteries being included....a lot of good that did, since they were dead when the item arrived."
1,Look elsewhere,"This book has the right information in it. The problem is that it is laid out in incoherent chapters which have no cohesiveness whatsoever. It is impossible to find a topic using the index, definitions, or chapters. There are little summaries of ideas that never fully complete. I wish our professor had picked a better book rather than just grabbing a new edition of this every year."
4,Excellent book with more really illustrations and exercises,"I am Tran Ngoc Thuan An, student of Department of Information Technology, Hochiminh City University of Technology.I read the book ""System Analysis and Design"" through my lecturer's instruction. His name is Nguyen Manh Tho, teaching the subject : System Analysis and Design.I found in this book the full teachnique, examples, illustrations,demotrations and exercises with real applications.I hope after finish the course, I could work as the System analysist or System Designer.To me, this book just have 1 drawback. That's some chapter is still too theorical (e.g chapter 12,14,20,21). It's will better if the author give more exercise on these chapters."
2,Haven't even read it....too pricey,"As a graduate student, the price of this book is ridiculous!!!!after my upcoming class, I'll provide another review."
2,Bad at explaining things,"I needed this book for a course. It is over priced. I find it hard to follow for two reasons 1)It doesn't give concrete examples 2)Compared to other engineering/science books it has a lot of filler. I just red a passage between two people and it had junk like ""Come one Dave! How could an automated lawn mower be that similar to a swimming pool cleaning robot?"". Not to sound bitter but when you're trying to study you want to understand the material as soon as possible."
5,Breathtaking,"I was sceptical before reading the script and seeing the movie, all that hype I thought. Usually what accompanies the hype is not justified. However, in this case it is. It is a winding road of emotion; hilarity, happines and not sadness as such but realism. Close to the bone realism. Excellent. If you see one film this year, make it this one. When is the video out?"
3,Good,"The movie is good, so this is good. But one thing I like about the screenplay version of TERMINATOR 2 is that it includes additional scenes, etc., that didn't make the final film. The orignal version of AMERICAN BEAUTY has the drug-dealer boy friend being framed for Spacey's murder, and also Spacey actually has sex with his daughter's friend. They changed those things for the movie, and I would have liked to have seen the alternate versions, even if as an appendix at the end. But nice to have the script nonetheless."
5,Breath Taking,This was one of the finest screen plays that I have ever read. I would almost rather have read it first then see the movie first. The way that Ball tells his story is incredilbe. Reading this screen play helps you to fully understand the greatness that is American Beauty. The story is amazing. The character has such depth and the atmosphere and visual imagery that Ball creates is breath talking. It is truly a master piece and deserving of it's Oscar.
4,Inspiring,"It's easy to connect with this movie because we all know how it feels like to be pushed around like Lester, to be cold like Carolyn, bratty and ""willful"" like Jane, repressed like Colonel Fitts, vain like Angela, and last but not least--genuine like Ricky.I think all the characters in this movie/script represent different facets of me, of most people. That's the reason why people have been so enthusiastic about this movie. It taps into emotions that no one had the guts or sense to bring up.We all go a little nuts sometimes.The scene with the plastic bag is CLASSIC. That's something millions of movie fans will remember for years to come. The sex scenes turned off softer viewers, but come on--this is the twenty-first century. Nothing's shocking. And this movie does a good job of following its themes, still."
5,Nothing can get close enough to reality then this.,"This movie is got to be my favorite movie that I will ever see in my life time. This movie has a great story line and sends a moral for everyone who watches the film. I really don't know what to say about this awesome film, but thoughout the whole movie I was riding the enjoyment of American Beauty. I didn't know it could be so beautiful. What I learned was, you can't worry about all the things in your life because its just too much and soon, things will begin to fall apart somehow. I guess then you suppose to let many of aspects of you life to face the fall."
2,bummer.,"i paid money for this???what was i thinking???pathetic scare factor, poor acting, low low low budget film.i need to get a life if this is what i have come to watch.if you like yourself watch something else!"
2,Not too bad,"This movie wasn't half bad but I did have to deduct some stars because it was advertized as being in the Pacific Northwest while it was obviously filmed in Southern California, the bigfoot looked more like a demon than a real bigfoot and the ending was confusing and made no sense. Besides that it is an OK movie to watch if you are bored and have nothing else to do."
4,Full of cheesy goodness,"Quite well done for a super low budget horror flick. If you want a movie you can laugh at and yet still enjoy, this is a good choice."
5,Where Greatness Begins...,"All hail the champions of no-budget cinema!While a little rough around the edges, ""Lost Woods"" blasts off the screen as the product of hard-work and ingenuity by two excellent filmmakers and a very crafty cinematographer on the rise. As rookie work tends to go, the Ellering Bros. weren't content with a talking-heads bunt - they went for a full on creature-feature home run instead, and as far as I'm concerned? This one hit McCovey Cove. If you're looking for Oscar-calibre dialogue or ILM-level special effects, you're missing the point. This is the start of amazing talent; this is Boxcar Bertha or Dementia 13 or THX 1138 or any other early flick by a big time director. It's not perfect, but that's a unfair bar to set at this point. This is the start of something amazing, and there's no better time to say you were there from the beginning than RIGHT NOW. Get this movie, get on board, and hang on!"
5,Sauron,"This young and very beautiful lady is one great guitar player and singer, and Violet Journey is a must have. This little lady (18 when this was recorded) can flat out play guitar and is a very talented songwriter with a very listenable singing voice. I for one cannot wait until she releases her first American title (she is from Australia) which is due pretty soon. Carlos Santana, a guitar icon, had some very flattering words to say about this young prodigy and that is one hellava endorsement."
5,Scorchin',"Surreal = bizarre or dreamlike.Get your boots on, strap in and take off on a Violet Journey with the amazing Orianthi. After seeing her shred a PRS on the 2009 Grammys as Carrie Underwood's lead axe I knew there was something special about this girl. . .let's say woman. . . outstanding is one adjective I can think of. . . phenomenal is the other. Violet Journey encapsulates a few months in 2005 of Orianthi off in her own little world recording this Aussie debut. I so wish the songs were longer. I enjoy every song on this CD. I am highly anticipating her US debut in 2009. I'm sure others are as well. Catch her on YouTube performing with Santana and other great guitarists."
5,Great CD,"This is a more instrumental cd, and it really shows how great is Orianthi with her guitar. Really good for those who enjoy classic rock guitar music."
5,easy to follow,"Easy to follow. Great for homeschooling, teaching others to read, math, and cursive. Can be a wonderful tutor for after school work. Can be used for teaching others and gives pointers for helping you start your own tutoring class in your home or at your local school."
2,Not as useful as I had hoped,"First, note that this is the same book as hisConversational Powerso don't get both. The hardback Lifetime Conversation Guide has the benefit of not falling apart. Conversational Power fell apart before I had even finished reading it (and I treat books well). As I said in my review ofConversational Power, a much better book, that is both beautifully written and covers many subtleties that this book lacks, isHow To Start A Conversation And Make Friends."
1,Watch out for serious upset tummy!,My dog is 8lbs--I followed the instructions to the letter and my poor pooch started getting diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days straight. I had to spend almost $100 at the vet's office to get her healthy again. Be careful how much you give them--I would cut the suggested dose in half (at least) just to be on the safe side and work your way up from there gradually after you see how they do.
3,disappointed...my dog doesn't like it,purchased this product on the advice of my vet. went to use on my pet's food and he won't eat it.
4,Dogs with flaky skin,We have been using this product for @ 5 years and it does the job. They use to have a pump dispenser that did not work well and has been dropped from their list.The current squeeze bottle is fine.
4,I like it.,It would not start my 4hp compressor but it helped out durring Hurrican Sandy. I attached it to my Chevy volt 12v battery and ran an extension cord from the inverter to the house. It ran my lights and TV for 48 hours (shut it off when asleep) and then I used a gas generator. I dont think its 3000 amps. I would guess it to be 1800 to 2000 amps. The price was good. I plan on getting a huge one in the future.
4,Butt-Kicking Inverter,"Bought this inverter for my new pick up truck so I can plug pretty much anything I want while I'm on the road. Had it installed and started using it right away. Plugged in a power strip and I ran my laptop, and a portable tv. While taking a break at at scenic outlook area, I plugged in a coffee maker and had a cup of joe while enjoying the view. I can't wait to see what else I can do with this inverter. The only thing I can say that the manufacturer can improve is to reduce the overall size of the unit. Just a little to long and too high. This can be an issue in a smaller truck."
3,Very confusing book,"I read the other two How Good Is poker books on pot-limit Holdem and pot-limit Omaha and liked those. This 3rd book in the series is a disappointment. I find it very confusing to read. In the hand examples, they keep going first to hypothetical situations, then back to the actual hand. This is a very confusing approach. It is difficult to follow the hands. When you read the answers, you will have difficulty following which situations the answers relate to. I also think this book does not have the same level of insight as the other two."
5,Good Practice Book,"This is a book with 24 practice hands, with quizzes on each stage of each hand. It's an excellent learning tool for an intermediate player after digesting Ed Miller's Small Stakes Holdem. I particularly enjoyed how the playing styles of opponents were factored into the quizzes."
4,You Will Know if you can play after reading this book,"This is a quiz book. A very good quiz book. Its not easy.It will seperate the intermediate from the very good poker player.For the very top level player, you may argue with some of it, but its still helpful. I recommend it."
4,Probably one of my favorite Spidey costumes,"The Marvel Select line is one of the better lines for figures that are meant for display and not so much for actual playing. I love the Iron Spider suit and really wanted to add this to my collection. The figure really looks nice even without the ""arms"" the suit has in the comics. Since he's just a repaint of the Symbiote Spider-Man, you can see on his hands where the web shooters are from the original. He's very articulate and his base is nice looking too. It looks very nice with my other Select figures."
4,Worth the money,"These bodhrans are worth the money. These are not professional models, but very good for someone wanting to learn to play bodhran or for someone just wanting to casually play. They re well made, and sound good. These are not tuneable."
4,Warrenty,"I bought this video camera in August, I got jumped by three guys wanting the video camera and I wouldn't let go of it the side of the camera got ripped off lost the HDD card some how all while these guys are hitting me. So I contact JVC bring it to there repair place and they didn't charge me for the Estament which is 50 dollars Thank you JVC. So they check out the camera and give me the total of what it will cost to repair 773.51 including labor of course. Be careful if you need your camera repaired and it's not even a year old. I would check warrenties on everything you buy aperently JVC's warrentie of one year is fake, While this is good camcorder the shake at long shoots is very shaky the OIS does not work that great or may be I just can't control my hands shaking."
3,"Camcorder excellant product, included software BAD","This JVC camcorder is excellent, nice to be able to record to a hard drive vs. tape, Can record 7-14 hours before having to transfer to a computer. The camcorder itself deserves a rating of 5 stars, included software 0 stars. But JVC support is lacking. I have spoke to them 4 times, The first one after asking for a supervisor hung up on me, The others that I spoke with had VERY limited knowledge of this unit. The software that comes with this unit is ""crippleware"" For the price that you pay for this unit it should include the full version of the software. They even state in their manual that the included software has limited functions, but they show the full version in the manual. This limited software is not disclosed until you open the box, load the software or read the manaul. The full version is an additional $179.00 dollars."
1,Broken,Bought this Camera system to record my baby girl growing up......used it very little and already its broken. Will not record feel as though JVC really took me on this one. Get a real camera this is just a cheap toy.
1,Reprint,I really like F.B. Meyer. But this book has terrible print. Painful to read. Why do they call it a reprint when it's just a blown up copy of an old poorly printed book?
2,Check out the new model!,"The FA-CH has been replaced by a newer model charger, the FA-CR. Will function with both FABP battery packs installed or removed from the FRS units.One note: the FA-CH comes with a car cord but the FA-CR doesn't."
5,The best bilingual children's book I have read!,"We have many bilingual children's books and this one is, by far, the best. I have purchased several copies because we give it as a gift for our friends."
2,"Nice Story, Weak Writing, Terrible Binding!","I have read this with five of my kindergarten classes as we learned about the various arts and traditions of Mexico. The story is nice, but the writing is clunky and I keep wanting a more effective storyteller to offer a new version. Additionally, the binding is so poorly made, that after reading the book seven or eight times it already looks years old and is falling apart."
1,total waste of $$,"this dvd was a total waste of my dollars; as a massage practitioner, I wanted some added insight into a modality I ALREADY do on a regular basis. This dvd wasn't fit for home viewing and was...yucky."
1,NOt good Dvd,"This dvd is bad quality, most of the time you can see only his back (camera is positioned on one spot) and cant see his hands or massage, I wish I didnt spent money on this because it not good to practice."
2,Pop Guard,"Sweetheart, take a wire coat hanger and fashion the triangle part as closely to a loop as you can. Dig out an old nylon that you'll never wear again because it has a run in it. stretch the nylon over the wire loop. Now twist the hook of the hanger around your mic stand and bend it so that the nylong covered loop is between your pretty mouth and the microphone. Sing to your heart's content. This will reduce the popping p's and t's and will cut down on some of those lip-smacky noises. There you go--No Charge."
