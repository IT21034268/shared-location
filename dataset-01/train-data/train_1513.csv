1,StupidHuhIdiotTrash,"This books really bit the dust. Crappy stuff and not that well written. I wish it was more inclusive of the JFK involvement, at least that is somethng we have learned from. Don't buy"
4,"A great grasp of the ""human"" condition","I have always admired Dr. Charles Stanley. For this Christian he has always been a source of wisdom. The Book FINDING PEACE is just the ticket if you, like me, at times, find yourself frustrated and not at peace. It is good practical, Bible based wisdom. It is a great study of the human condition. The only fault I find with the book, and it is a minor one, is that it is one thing to take control of your thinking and quite another to be caught up in circumstances beyond your control. I think that could have been addressed a bit more thoroughly. That being said, there is a lot of great Bible based advice in this book. I can recommend it."
4,Worth Reading!,"If you have not read this book by Dr. Stanley, you need to read it. You owe it to yourself. I continue to be amazed at his use of Scripture as it applies to the human soul.I highly recommend this volume."
4,"Finding Peace: God's Promise of a Life Free from Regret, Anxiety, and",have not completed the book but looking to forward since fellow employees strongly suggested the book and I like Dr. Charles Stanley
2,too much drums,"when i look for Windham Hill cds, i want acoustic music, not drums or vocals. there are too many songs here with heavy drumming. if he made this cd without the drums it'd be better."
1,Disappointing To Say the Least - Landmarks aren't Vintage,"I can't believe these nitwit authors have photographs w/ the caption: ""Red Tourist Tavern Site - 1933"" (for example)yet NEGLECT to note the actual date they their photographs were taken (circa 1989 or mid 1990's I'm guessing w/ Pintos whizzing in the background.) Okay if this book was $10 it wouldn't be as bad but having the gaul to charge $30 for a book w/ a bunch of black & white (I guess to throw you off) site-seeing pix is a real ripoff. I want my $ back! They even have a bunch of typos they lamely apologize for at the intro. Almost NO pics are from ""back in the day"". The landmarks are all contemporary looking. BE FOREWARNED!"
4,Pretty Darn Good,Interesting photos accompanied by a very informative and accurate narritive.If one has an interest in gangsters and outlaws of the 1930s this book is right up your tree.
2,A Disappointment,"This book contains a chronological listing of the crimes committed by many gangsters and pictures (some non-contemporary) of the crime scenes. There is very little text and what there is only skims the surface of the real tales. If this is what you are seeking, then this is what you what."
1,Decent but far from great...,14 solos. Mildly attractive. Well built. Gets old and only mildly arousing. Their is better.
5,history of the finns in michigan,great read for us yoopers! enjoyed it very much. most of the family names are still in this area. thanks
1,not for beginners!,"I've been using this text for two semesters. I have to say this book is too advanced for starters, especially after chapter 6. My biggest complaint is the author does not provide enough examples to illustrate the theorems. A majority of the sections usually go like: 1. proposition of a theorem 2. proof 3. major theorem. 4. proof 5. corollary 6. proof 7. tons of hard problems left to homework.I would suggest the author give more examples when showing off those hard theorems. It could be better if the author also provides solutions to (at least) half of the exercises at the end of each section. Remember your readers are not academic conference colleagues, but first-time undergrad students. We learn things from examples!"
3,Not a snug fit,"I bought this case from Amazon a couple of years ago, at a cost of around $14. It has worn well in that time, and the current offering price of around $9 makes this a good buy, considering the quality of the workmanship and materials. It's in my purse all the time, and the case holds up without showing scratches. That said, I got it for my RAZR 3 phone. For that particular model, the phone fits in it loosely. I had to get a plastic skin for the phone to add just enough thickness in order to have the phone stay in this case.August 13, 2011 update: This case has held up in my purse; it looks new. I have replaced my RAZR phone with my husband's old iphone 3G. which also has a plastic skin, and this case fits that phone as well."
4,A culmination of 5 early works.,"Glass Green is the culmination of Threads, In Another Country, Untitled,Three Feet From The Moon and Wheat and Rust. This CD shows how Story's writing style had matured to the release date of 1987. It should be noted that at this same time, he was nominated for a Grammy for the children's album he did with Rabbit Ears and Glenn Close, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.It is rather interesting that there are several motifs from this album that show up later in Lunz and The Perfect Flaw.I recommend this as good example of where Tim Story came from as well as where he was headed."
5,Sweet brown-eyed girl,"We bought this doll for our 2yr old so that she can identify with a brown-haired, brown-eyed doll. The doll is soft and just the right size to carry around."
1,"Do not buy this, yet","This review is for the MP3 DOWNLOADS, not the CD. The songs Pray and Prisoner have errors in them from when they were mastered to MP3. A horrible clicking noise runs through both songs. Probably from defective media. The Song No More Mourning skips like crazy."
1,I don't blame Gary for this debacle,"Ok, where to start....this is one of those action movies you know before u rent that it will be bad, but your curious to see just HOW BAD it could be. I hate these movies where the action scenes are so spread out between completely useless plot and worthless character development. Noone cares about how the damsel in distress feels about their past relationship, just get on with some action please! Having to endure painfull acting scenes between Gary and Franoise Yip is more than enough torure.other than a few martial arts scenes, this is a gun fight movie. Gary shines as usual. The ending where Gary chases Wolfe on foot through warehouse catwalks while Wolfe is on a motorcycle and Gary somehow manages to tackel him mid-air, um...yeah right. Also the grenade scene where Gary pushes Eva Habermann to safety while the grenade is 2 feet away, the explosion suddenly becomes 20 feet away...um okay."
2,Watered down Whirlwind...,"Unfortunately, James Clavell and his publisher fought during the last few years of his life. The result was that his final Asian saga novel, Whirlwind, is out of print. Escape is a watered down version of that novel, developed for a movie script. The core story is still there, but to get Clavell's intended story, buy Whirlwind at a used bookstore or online auction site."
1,"Escape, travesty and a waste of money!","This novel is a travesty and should never have been published. I am so sorry that any of my money went to a company, Coronet, that would render such a great author's work into a chopped up mess. Read Whirlwind, it is great and essentially you will get two books for one if you believe that Escape is one unto itself ( I obviously don't). I was expecting further elaboration upon the story line of Azadeh and Erikki but it is just each section that pertains to them chopped out of Whirlwind and put into a separate novel, butchers!"
5,JAZZ LOVERS DREAM,"I am so delighted with this album. I think this is what most jazz fans want but get too infrequently - a beautiful, intelligent, elegant, talented album start to finish. Jimmy Amadie's playing is superb, and together with Phil Woods (whose alto sax performance on ""Baby Blue"" will send you searching for Phil Woods' CDs), bassist Steve Gilmore and drummer Bill Goodwin, you have a quartet of the highest order - all veteran pros. I don't plan to loan this album out (I don't want to lose it). It's one you can showcase to impress your friends, and in quiet moments, yourself."
3,Decent product,"After much research, this seems like a good choice for adjustable dumbbells and dumbbell bench. I like the dumbbells ease-of-use and they come in 5-25 pound increments (more than most others anywhere close to this price.) I like that the bench is so adjustable, but it's a little cheaply built and wobbles from side to side."
5,One of the best books on health available,"The quality of the book is excellent on two fronts; beautiful binding, photographs and paper stock; however, nothing can beat the message: Live Foods, Live Bodies. The father of juicing, Jay, along with the message of living foods and easy to prepare meals from his wife, Linda, are unsurpassed in their application in today's world. Follow their message and prepare to live longer and healthier. This book has a place of honor in my kitchen and I use it daily."
1,would give it zero stars if I could,"Fortunately I had grown up without having to endure Kordich's commercials, unfortunately after buying this book and reading the load of bunk inside I watched some of his escapades on you tube - I don't think I have seen or read from an individual whom I find more offensive, egotistical, oafish and boorishOf 242 pages, only half are ""recipes"" the rest is the 2 individuals telling us how whe should go to church, light candles whenever we venture into the kitchen etc. We have to read quotes where he proudly puts his name to them - I guess some people need to continually see their name in print to think that they are successful.I tried to give the book away to friends who are vegetarians, but even they couldn't stand his writing style. The recipes are so basic I am sure even a 10 year old would have no trouble thinking them up if the produce were in the kitchen"
5,Course Book,Bought this book as required text for a social work course. Best textbook I've ever used. Great explanations of concepts and interesting exercises.
2,A Neoconservative's View of The State,"Will, a neoconservative often mistaken for a conservative of the old mold, presents his case for the Leviathan state. To Will, if government is good, then more government is better. He sees the state as the rightful architect of society, trusting politicians and bureaucrats to steer the proles along the path to greatness, meaning Empire. I regard neoconservatives as Judas goats; Will is a prime example. This is the man who, a few years ago, said that it is time America repealed ""the embarrassing Second Amendment."""
5,Excellent book. Greedy sellers.,"Thankfully, I bought copies of Syd Mead's books when they were fairly priced. Unfortunately, the greed of current owners of some of the copies of Syd's books - who probably don't care less for his work - are now on the prowl to make bank on Syd's talents. Will Syd get any royalties from these costs? Probably not. Keep your eyes peeled at your local bookstore. Any bookstore worth its reputation will have these books, but without the absurd costs."
3,Mead's business report.,"This book is showing recent Mead's works. Almost picture is draft level or concept level, though there may be problem of business contract. Undoubtedly, level of his work is high. But I do not feel spirit or enthusiasm from pictures of this book. His best is Sentinel2, I think. Did he get old?"
4,Wendy Rule,"I think that Wendy Rule's music is beautiful. And her voice is stunning. Being a metal listener myself, her music is a wonderful break for me. The instruments and soft and her voice just flows along with the music. She weaves myth and paganism into her music and a soft and un-intruding way. I would also recommend her cd ""Lotus Eaters"" it was the first album that I bought by her and I was instantly hooked.Also, if you are a fan of her voice, I would recommend Nightwish, her music has a more melodic metal/operatic sound to it, but it is very beautiful."
5,Delicious!!,"Given that I drink real milk and have tried other alternatives like soy and rice milk, I can say with confidence that this particular alternative is the Best I have tasted. It is delicious, creamy, and does not have that chalky aftertaste you sometimes find in others. The subtle hint of almond blends beautifully with the chocolate, and the overall flavor and texture make this drink so authentic that, had I not known it was not milk, I would not have guessed it!Some nutritional info from the side panel per 8 oz.:120 CaloriesTotal fat 3g (no saturated or trans fat, nor cholesterol)Sodium 150mgpotassium 250mgCarbs 22gfiber 1gSugars 20gProtein 2gVitamins A (10%), D (25%), E (50%)Calcium 20%Iron 4%Phosphorus 15%Magnesium (6%)"
5,A Feast for the Soul,"A collaboration of two creative women whose work is both useful and at the same time beautiful to view. The recipes represent good, down-to-earth-but-today's kind of cooking, promising a treat upon completion. They are easy to follow and don't require hours of shopping for the ingredients! The illustrations add pleasure to the reader. This book warms your heart and tummy."
3,"Nice, but not as represented","I have two other books by this author, and this one is just as beautiful as the others. I haven't actually compared the tables of content, but all these books seem to have the same recipes with a slight tweak or other. Lemonade, meatloaf, potato salad, etc. I'm not complaining about that. What I was disappointed in was the title vs. the content. ""Keeping Good Company: A Season-by-Season Collection of Recipes, with Entertaining and Homemaking Ideas."" Silly me, I was looking forward to Halloween tables, Christmas buffets, Easter picnics. There was nothing out of the ordinary, just slightly seasonal recipes. Not ONE holiday drawing. The pastel watercolor drawings are lovely, but I was hoping for a little bold black and orange or red and green. I think there was one ""homemaking"" idea, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was. These days it could have been green cleaning recipes, or floral water for linens, but it wasn't. Pretty, but same old, same old."
3,Not Worth The Money,"I bought this book for a class, and I was greatly disappointed in the material. A lot of the material is biased and not well-written, though there are some parts at the end of the chapters that are interesting tests. I wouldn't buy it again, I don't think I even used it for the class. The book was in good condition, but half the content isn't even related to the subject."
2,Talk about sex and stress,"Almost every example and story Mr. Greenberg relates in this book has some sexual/romantic/dating overtone to it. I found this quite funny actually.As it's title suggests, it's a read about how to reduce stress and learn to relax and smell the roses. There are chapters on meditation to spirituality to biofeedback and of course different forms of stress. He begins most chapters with experiences that he's either had or know of someone who has experienced it."
3,Alright,"The book had some pages ripped out of it, some text highlighted and some underlined but it was in good condition for the most part. If you are looking to buy this book to reduce your stress, don't do it. Find a time management plan instead."
5,An extremely enjoyable read,"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. The stories Sparks tells about his experiences made me laugh out loud at times and made me cry at others. This is not only his story of a trip around the world with his brother, but a story of growing up and the tragedies they have faced together. His story is a special one and one definately worth reading. I will be reading this one over and over again."
4,Very Emotional,"It took me a while to get into the autobiography of Nicholas Sparks, but if you can get past the beginning, it is a very emotional story. I listened to it while I was driving and I was tearing up a few times, which isn't too good while driving, LOL. I think this would actually make a good movie."
1,3 weeks with my culturally insensitive brother:,"I was appalled by the insensitivity shown in this book towards foreign cultures, history and guides trying to speak English. I wonder how many languages Nicholas and Micha speak?"
4,Traveling across the world,A very good read from start to finish. Life always has its twits and turns. Family dynamics builds everyone's character through out life.
4,Three Weeks with My Brother,"I love Nichols Sparks books, have read all of them, except for this one and had wished I had read it in order as written, the book was exceptional, now I am going back and re-reading the others."
4,J.C.B. South Range Wisc. USAThree Weeks with My Brother,This book was so touching. I have read his books and love his style of writing. I appreciate his so openess about his relationship with God. He also revealed his life story and the openess of his struggles and losses. His solid marrage father and his brother holds testimony to living wiithin his beliefs.
5,Beautifully written!,This is a different kind of book but wonderful! Any Sparks fan will love this! You will laugh and cry. Have some tissues nearby and enjoy! Fan for life!
1,Let's be Real Here!,"When I saw that Nicholas Sparks wrote a travel book, of all things, the first thought I had was: hmmm...he must be biding some time between novels. In other words, write something, ANYTHING to keep the name in the public eye and make a few bucks to boot. Most of us who keep tabs on the publishing world are well aware that Mr. Sparks could get his grocery list published and it would go to the top of the bestseller list. No secret there. I guess I was just taken aback that he tapped into nonfiction and his family history to reap the rewards."
1,disappointed customer,"I am unable to review this product because i have yet to recieve it. i have sent a message to the seller asking where it was and if i would be recieving it any time soon and i have yet to get a response. i would like to get my money back because this seller failed to make me, the customer, happy. i was asked to rate this seller and this transaction and i gave the seller one star only because i had to. i do not feel the seller deserves any stars because i am in no way satisfied."
3,Correct Use of Cell Phones,"To sum up this book - the author went to the top of an ancient Mexican pyramid and was so proud of his accomplishment that he whipped out his cell phone and made a bragging phone call to his wife, who was stuck at home with five kids while he was out making an ass of himself with his brother.Some things are sacred, and should be experienced with silence. Would he use a cell phone in a church?His antics while ""on holiday"" (indeed, on holiday from any sort of manners) were similar, in that he acted as if the world was his playground. My reading of his memoir was soured by my opinion of him as a person. I also had a hard time believing what poor parents he had. Who would give a kid with a sprained arm a band-aid?"
5,My Favorite,"This is by far one of my most favorite novels by Nicholas Sparks. It included travel, one of my most valued interests, and a history of his life, which was very endering. I have read all of his books and after reading this book it made some of the other books make so much more sense!"
4,Great read for people with siblings,Nice to see this side of the well-loved author. It encouraged me to look at my own relationship with my siblings and I am planning a trip with my own brother soon!
2,Unfortunately disappointed. . .,I couldn't believe it--this is the ONLY Nicholas Sparks book I didn't like. I didn't even finish it--which is a major surprise because I LOVE LOVE LOVE all his books. . .oh well
3,A History Lesson,"I have to say that Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author, I read and own all of his books. Though it usually takes me only about 2 days to read his books because they are so hard to put down, I found some difficulty to finish this one. I felt that the author put to much focus on what they saw on their trip and all the history behind what they visited. I enjoyed the parts when he talked about his childhood and his recent life and family a great deal more than the history about what they visited on their trip. I found myself skipping over these parts to get to ""the good stuff""."
2,Eh.,"I love Nicholas Sparks and I love travelogues, so when I saw this book on the shelf I bought it immediately. I trudged through the first 50 pages, hoping that the story would pick up once they started the trip. Sadly, though, I found the story and storytelling to be flat and lacking. I only stayed with them through Easter Island before abandoning the book to a corner of my desk, but nothing in the story made me want to travel, or travel with the people I care about. Nothing made me even want to turn a few more pages to see where they go next.There are much better travel stories and much better Nicholas Sparks books out there. Stick with those."
1,Three Weeks With My Brother Who Gives American Tourists a Bad Name,"I was a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. Until this. The better title would have been ""Three Weeks Where My Brother and I Act Like Spoiled American Frat Boys"". It's no wonder American's get such a bad wrap while travelling abroad. Not only did these two knuckleheads have the nerve to act the part of obnoxious tourists, they then had the nerve to write about it. Go home Sparks brothers."
4,A true evolutionary tale,"It is very enlightening to learn something about an author whose works we love to read. This is a glimpse into the personal side of the man who brought us The Notebook, Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember. In Three Weeks with my Brother, Nick and Micah Sparks travel around the world on a 3 week trip in which they see marvelous wonders of the world and discover things about themselves in the process. The book is written in an almost travelogue type format with stories of their childhood interwoven throughout. From the good times to the bad times, Micah and Nick really discover themselves and each other on this trip. It is a true evolutionary tale as the brothers grow as man and fathers and friends. What a great read!"
2,Disappointing,"An interesting blend of early childhood experiences and the retelling of his trip around the world with his brother began to fall flat for me after a while because the brother is a jerk. While on their first few days of the journey at a Mayan ruin, the immature brother desicrates a sacred Mayan ritual stone by acting out his own sacrifice for the benefit of a tourist photo op much to the shock of the local guide. Mr. Sensitive continues around the world experiencing cultures with his brother. I gave up half way through."
1,Who does #2 Work For?,"Sentimental Cra##. That what this is. It is so painful, reading such muncane recollections. More or less, this is what you just went through growing up in your own life, with a few tragic twists. Save your time and money and close your eyes and think about your own memories, rather than this guy's."
5,Three Weeks with My Brother,Fabulous Story! There were parts that made me laugh out loud and other parts that had me choked up and brought tears to my eyes. I listened to the CDs during a solo 9.5 hour road trip and it made the journey go so fast. I loved every minute!
4,Very inspiring,"I wasn't too sure that I really wanted to read this book, but then again I have loved all of the Nicholas Sparks books; so I couldn't miss one just because it was about ""men""!This book was fantastic! What a childhood these two boys had! It brought me back to my childhood and their trip was all inspiring.Don't miss this one... it's just as great as all of Nicholas Sparks' writings."
4,Three weeks with my brother,This was a slower read in the begginning and got better middle/end. Very cool to see how his life was growing up & it explains who he wrote every book about. Very interesting!
4,Heartfelt,"This is a heartfelt review of a family and their struggles,plus a special view of a trip to interesting places around theworld. Great read !"
4,Three Weeks with My Brother,"This auther has my full attention. I have read every book so far that he has written . This is the one I could never find,so thanks to Amazon I have it now.'The biographey is interesting and it takes you to places around the world not usually visited. A good ending."
4,Good Mix,"Nice blend of travel journal and family history. Laughed and cried. It was my book club selection, so not a title I would have selected, but I'm glad I read it."
1,Horrible Reading,"I agree with other readers who thought he was conceited. Very rude as they travel to other countries and disrespected their culture. All he could talk about was how poor they were growing up. His father was pursuing a PhD in their ""poor"" stages. The author mentions the stupid stuff they did when they were younger but they behave today the same way as they did when they were kids. As for Micah, it's amazing that he met someone who could stand him."
1,A 300 page lame Christmas letter,"This thing was so breezy and boring, so filled with self-absorption. At least when we get someone's annual family update in the mail it's someone we know and care about. The author's endless whining was just over-sharing as far as I'm concerned. I suffered through this selection for book club and kept waiting for someone to get to the point."
2,"Only half way through, I decided not to finish it","Sometime in the past, I remember a speaker or someone saying that Spark's best book was Three Weeks With My Brother. At every flea market, used book venue, Goodwill (but I repeat myself), I looked for it--to no avail. So I ordered it from Amazon. It sat awhile on my shelf as have a couple of his novels.But I pulled it off and began. I didn't know anything about Nicholas Sparks except his popularity as a novelist. I appreciated the way he told a double story: the sights of his and Micah's trip; the way he segued into the memoir's past, but about half way through, I decided I knew more than enough about the Sparks family. It was sappy, almost maudlin in places. I have too many other books to read to spend time on one not so well-written as I hope his novels are."
4,Not a travelogue,"Nicholas Sparks -- author of novels-turned-into-movies like ""Notebook"" and ""Message in a Bottle"" -- uses an around-the-world trip with brother Michah Sparks as the catalyst for this autobiographical work. It is largely about pain, ranging from Nicholas' pain over feelings of emotional neglect because he was the ""middle child"" between an older brother and a younger sister to the childhood pain of seeing his close companion drifting away from him as the boys moved in different circles of friends during their school years. However, pain also strengthened the bond between the brothers as they faced the loss of loved ones; no one else had the memories they shared, so no one else could understand the depth of their hurt. Sparks's clear and simple style makes for easy reading so that the emotions are not obsured by language."
5,Roller coaster ride,"I have read all of Sparks' novels and love them all, some more than others. I have had this book in my bookcase ever since it came out several years ago. It was given to me as a gift and I just didn't think I would enjoy it as much as his novels. I just finished reading it and boy, was I ever wrong. It is an excellent read! I love the relationship Sparks has with his brother, Micah. This being his life story, it has all the ups and downs that life can have. As they say, ""I laughed, I cried and I couldn't put it down."" (Or something like that!) I enjoyed the way Sparks transitions between the trip and stories about his life growing up and about his family. I was able to identify with much of his life story as I have experienced some of the same sadnesses and tragedies in my life. If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, I highly recommend this book. It gives you a background into who he is and some insight into the basis for many of his novels."
5,My Most Favorite Nicholas Sparks Book!,"Excellent! I laughed, I cried - sometimes at the same time. I'm reviewing this book three years after I read it. I often remember lines from the book, and the brothers' impressions regarding places visited in the book. It is ""primer"" for inside information on his other books. I listened to this book on audio cd's, and loved the reading. A wonderful experience that has stuck with me."
5,New and wonderful,"""Three weeks with my brother"" is perhaps my favorite Nicholas Sparks books so far. Your heart will go out to the family and will make you want to re-read other Sparks books. It's real life drama and love can't but make you emotional."
4,Three weeks with my brother,"I bought this book for my wife, she's an avid reader and she loved the book. She finished reading it in one week. Great buy and she was pleased."
5,"A wonderful, insightful book","Reading this book was like looking through a window into the soul of Nicholas Sparks. Although it was the very first book by this author that I have read, it will most definitely not be the last. I feel that the journey through the history of his family is crucial to understanding the real reason for the trip with his brother Micah. After completing this book, I felt as though I had been a family friend for all of my life."
4,It hooked me...,It was very interesting to not only see all that the author had to go through growing and how well he turned out but also the inspiration in his experiences that he used for his novels. I have read ALL of his books to date and found it amazing how he has been able to create such masterpieces. It was inspirational.I was also moved to see the close relationship that he had with his brother.He kept me wanting to read more...very well work the read.
2,Not all useable,"This started out just fine. The item came, and I started listening to it. Just about half way through the tapes were garbled when I tried to play them. I even tried them in two different tape players, and got the same thing. Something was wrong with the tapes, and they couldn't be played anywhere.I assume the seller didn't know that, but it would pay to listen to what you have before selling it."
4,Sparks does it again,"With ""Three Weeks..."", Nicholas Sparks delivers a touching tale of familial connectedness and the power of hope. More autobiographical than some of his previous work, Sparks follows this new direction right to the core of human emotion. Powerful stuff.If you're into writers like Sparks, Michael Chabon, John Irving, etc., then there's a new writer you should check out: Greg Ippolito. His new novel, ""Zero Station,"" is absolutely terrific, and an excerpt is available for FREE. He's still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read. You can check him out and read the excerpt at: www.ZERO-STATION.net. Don't miss it!"
2,Not the normal books he writes,I didn't even finisgh this book. And I love Nickolas Sparks! It just felt like I was reading some kind of research or information kind of thing. For sure not his best stuff! I will continue reading his books though because he is an awesome author and this was a book with his brother. Hope this helps.
5,great book,"excellent book and good insight to this amazing author. would suggest to anyone, teens to seniors. could be a middle school mandatory reading because it have life and travel learning!!"
4,Great read!,What a wonderful story. Easy to read and kept my interest. Would recommend to a friend in a minute. Loved the family and personal background that he shares with his readers.
5,Heartfelt and educational,"Nicholas sparks books are always great. They always make me cry, this was no exception. Enjoyed the history lesson of his travels and the stories of his and Micah's life."
4,A fun journey,"I was initially turned on to Nicholas Sparks because my girlfriend told me that I have a similar writing style as him, which naturally piqued my curiosity.I picked up one of her many copies of his books and started reading Three Weeks w/ my Brother. You can imagine my surprise when noticing uncanny similarities to our writing styles, not to mention sense of humor. I'll be honest, I preferred the story of his life more than the trip itself. His roller-coaster life story has some interesting parallels to my novel, The Domino Effect, as you could probably guess by the title.I liked reading 'Three Weeks' so much that I've since read several others, namely: A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle.Sparks definitely has a uniqueness about him. Even though his storylines aren't terribly original, there is always something about them that draws the reader in. That is a rare talent."
3,Just alright,"I just finished this book this morning and I have to say it was just average. Having just come back from a trip with my own brother and being of similar age to the Sparks brothers, I connected with this book on some level, but not completly. For instance, they refer to each other as ""Brother"" or "" Little Brother"". I have never really heard brothers regularly refer to each other in that way. I also never realy connected with the family as a whole, so I wasn't vested in the loss of his father or mother as there was a sense of detachement for both throughout the book. His sister's struggle and ultimate death was hard to read due to my own relationship with my younger sister, so the last third of the book gripped me more than the first 2/3s.All in all, it is an average book. If I were to rate it, ""Tuesday's with Morrie"" was a 10 on a 10 point scale, the ""Tender Bar"" was a 9 while this book was an even 6."
4,"If you like Nicholas Sparks, you will like this book!","I've been a fan of Nicholas Sparks pretty much since the beginning of his career as an author. This book didn't let me down. It introduced me to the same Nicholas put on a more real level. He shared personal struggles, triumphs, and overall relationship with his family. The book left me wanting to call my family and letting them know how much they mean to me. I would recommend this book."
5,Wonderful Story of a True Family,"I loved this book. Micah Sparks and Nicholas Sparks go on a trip together, and as they are exploring far-away lands we learn about their family life growing up.This story was very touching and heart-felt. It is a real story of growing up in a family, and the relationship of brothers when they are adults. Especially moving were the parts where they had to deal with death in their family. But it was also fun to read about the brothers as adults interacting together on their vacation in foreign countries.I liked how the story went back and forth between the trip they were on, and their memories growing up. It was a wonderful touching story and I highly recommend it."
5,So far so good! (Premature review)-- fit true to size,"I haven't gotten to use these in the pool yet, so I'll update when I do. But wanted to do a quick posting to let others know I believe the sizing is true to size; at least for size small. I've seen others say they run large. I have really small hands. I ordered the small, and they're just right for me. Can't wait to try 'em out in the water!"
4,written review,The gloves arrived in a timely manner and in good condition but they weren't what I thought they were which was my fault. The tips of my fingers may be cold when I swim since that is what I'll use them for but I'll just have to wear another glove covering to cover my whole hand. They will be helpful though in keeping my hands warm.
4,Swim gloves,Excellent product. This is my second pair. the only reason I bought another pair is that the velcro was past its use by date The gloves themselves are great.Definately enhances one's training. Have noticed the arm strength has impoved. Would continue to buy
3,Meets expectations.,Product is well constructed. Fits better than expected. Came in color and size specified. Received in a timely fashion.
4,A little tight,"I love my swim gloves! They are a bit too tight. I got the smaller size because a previous reviewer said they tend to stretch. not yet, but I suspect they will with time so I am not unhappy at all."
1,out out brief candle,"These lovely gloves turned to shredded like lettuce after only two months of use. I rinsed them thoroughly after every use, I never left them long in the gym bag, but all to no avail.The Head gloves I bought to replace them have done much much better."
1,Not what I was expecting,"These were not what I was expecting at all. I was hoping for something useful in increasing resistance while swimming but the webbing in between the fingers in these gloves is way too flimsy to provide any kind of resistance, even for the suggested workouts that come with the gloves."
1,"spend more, get a better product","I had a pair of water gloves made by Power Systems but wore them out. I sent the Speedos back. I couldn't get the wrist strap tight enough to keep the glove on my hand. A couple of sweeps through the water -- off it came. Also, they just felt uncomfortable. A different size would not have helped."
4,Strengthen your swim workout,These definitely do what you would expect and are fairly comfortable (although you may have some sore shoulders the next day ;-). I wasn't sure if I should get the medium or the large and wish I had gone with the smaller size.
3,NOT THE BEST,"All in all the gloves are acceptable. I don't know if it is just this pair, but the velcro on the left wrist is not positioned properly. Unless I make it tighter, in which case not all the velcro is overlapping, the wrist space is too large and water gets in a and makes a drag. The right wrist is fine. This is the 4th pair of gloves I've used. The best so far were by Zura, but I couldn't get the same model."
3,swim gloves,I bought the speedo aqua gloves in December 09 and within 3 weeks the rubber started coming off around the thumb area. I notified Amazon.com and they were very helpful in replacing them for me. I have had the new pair about 3 weeks and they are also starting to wear in the thumb area. I swim laps for 1 hour a day and love how you can glide through the water with the gloves on but they just don't seem to hold up for any length of time.
1,Didn't work for me.,This gloves were not comfortable on my hands.They felt too tight and not natural.I decided to train with bear hands.
2,"Decent quality, HEAVY when wet.","I bought these to firm up my upper arms. They do work you out, however, I felt that the fit wasn't very nice. My hands are outstretched kinda uncomfortably and feel strange. I like that they float in the water so you can easily locate them. I don't like that they WEIGH a bit more when they are wet. I feel that they give you the extra kick in your swim and speed, however, its weight and lack of fit gets hefty after a half hour of swim. A lighter and thinner fabric would be better and yet more of a harder/stiff frame would give it more distance after a push with these gloves on."
3,Not meant for small-wristed people,"These fit well in the palms (I bought the small ones), and they definitely add intensity to my workouts. However, for people with small wrists, it's difficult to attach them by the velcro while still keeping them tight because there's not enough velcro overlap. I will try rubberbanding the flap down to try to make them less annoying."
3,"It's Speedo, what did you expect?",Speedo is the hallmark of aquatic products. I trust the reinforce stitching. Gloves are true to sizes specified. The color matches my new Aqua Pro Ankle weights. :-)
5,Great gloves for strength training,"I recently returned to swimming regularly and had not tried swim gloves. The Speedo gloves are great for strength training, they fit well, go on and come off easily."
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"The gloves fit snug and do a fine job providing resistance for an improved swimming workout. I brough the gloves with hopes of adding a little something extra to my swimming. They do a great job adding ""push"" through the water. You can also manipulate your fingers and hands while wearing this product."
5,Great for aqua aerobics,Keep me warm and help to create resistance in the water whwn doing arm workouts. Try them you'll see a difference.
3,DON'T WORK AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED FOR,"I'm an avid participant in water aerobic classes, and used to use the gloves that my fitness center provided. But I decided to buy my own pair recently, and have found a couple issues with this particular brand:1) They run a bit larger than expected. I bought a Medium, and they are a bit too big for me.2) They don't stay fastened with the velcro! I find myself constantly having to stop what I'm doing to reattach the velcro wristband.They seem to be made well as far as the materials used for the actual glove itself; sturdy and provide good resistance in the water. I only wish the velcro wristband stayed attached during my exercising. It may have to do with the fact that again, these are a bit big for my hand, and I have to pull the velcro strap over as far as it goes to attach them."
4,great product,These gloves are great for adding extra resistance when swimming laps . Very comfortable but found that I was unable to tighten the velcro up to properly fit my wrists. I bought a large and they fit well but it would be better if the velcro section was just a bit longer. Overall - great fit - great product -
5,Swim Gloves,"They're awesome! I can feel my pull getting stronger, as I become a faster swimmer. Would highly recommend these to competitive triathletes."
4,LOVE THEM!!,"Even though these are still a bit big on my hands, ( I have seriously small hands), they are a really great workout aid in the Aqua Fit classes I am taking. I never dreamed a pool workout could make me as sore as a weight training session!! Leaving out one star as they would be a bit more comfortable if they fit a bit further down on the wrist and could be tightened a little more. This is mostly due to my VERY small hands and Speedo does not offer extra small...My daughter (11 yrs) even loves them!!"
5,sleek and comfortable,"I've been wearing swim gloves for several years and I've been very pleased with the quality of these. These gloves are the only brand I've worn-much more comfortable than wearing the paddles on the hands. The velcro stays secure and strong . I swim laps twice/week and go through a pair of these about every 2 years. The neoprene right past the wrist area will show ""wear"" with all the putting on and taking off over time, of course. I recommend this brand."
4,Good value!,I got these and have had no problems with them. They increase resistance for the upper body during water aerobics and have neoprene palms for slip resistance when climbing out of the pool. Good value!
1,Disappointed,"My purchase of Speedo Aqua Fit Training Swim Gloves is a dud. The gloves began fraying at the fingertip ends almost immediately. Before two weeks had elapsed, one glove was splitting at the thumb-to-index finger line of stitching.Unusual wear is showing on a pair my friend just purchased that he has used for two weeks.Both pairs must be returned to Amazon.Len"
2,not as shown,This shows gloves with a velcro wrist. What I recieved was two pair with zippers. The zippers are very low quality and more suited for doll clothes than athletic equipment. The zipper pull broke after a few months of use and I had to sew the sippers shut. I would not recommend these cheaply made gloves.
4,speedo aqua fit swim glove,"Good product. Does what it is supposed to do. Only problem is that i purchased a ""medium"" since I wear a 7 glove. The glove runs large and I should have chosen a small. It would have been good to have sizing info"
2,Aqua fit gloves,I do waterfit six days a week and need a pair of gloves that will with stand the chlorine in the pool. I have always used the brand Water Gear and thought I would try Speedo but after several weeks using them I will go back to Water Gear for my next purchase. Speedo will hold up in the chlorine as well but for my hands which are very small the Water Gear feel more comfortable. These are a great price and well constructed but this is just my personal preference.
1,not received,"I am still waiting for this shipment, perhaps its due to the storms that have been around for awhile. too bad"
5,Rick Nelson,"This is a wonderful collection of Rick Nelson at his best.It takes us all back to the easy times and easy days of the 60's and early 70's when rock n roll was ""rock n roll"".The smooth sound and beautiful voice of Rick is captured here to the fullest.One of the great singers of the time."
3,"Lots of facts, but little cohesion","This book is a wonderful collection of facts, giving you a wave of information about DIY music and publishing (although she mainly sticks to 'zines, not self-published books or anthologies) The style of writing is pretty dreadful, and it made for slow going, and there was little cohesion between areas. Rather than have a thesis, the book concludes just about every chapter with comments like ""And that's part of DIY culture."" or ""DIY culture is really important""If you're looking for basic information on DIY music and publishing, and don't mind the lack of a coherent flow, it's a great book. However, if you're looking for insight on the world of DIY, you won't find it here."
2,Repetitious History,"For those readers already familiar with Michael Azzerand's ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"" (cited in this book) or Kaya Oakes ""Slanted or Enchanted"" (published later) Amy Spencer's disconnected, narrow history of the DIY culture might appear to simply be retracing limited steps. The Minutemen's ""jamming econo"" ethos sets the foundation, but fails to incorporate much more beyond a background on the (now-obsolete) art of writing zines and nurturing mail-order punk labels, despite the culture's rich history and significant modern-day presence. (Azzerand's book thoroughly discusses legendary punk label distributors, while Oake's traces independent publishing back to the beat poets).With that said, I would recommend this book only to younger readers (let's say mid to late teens) who are already engaged and inspired by DIY, but not all that familiar with (some of) its roots."
5,Woodhaven Deluxe Miter Gauge,"After purchasing and returning an Incra miter gauge, I ordered the Woodhaven. (I spent several hours assembling and adjusting the Incra, only to be repeatedly frustrated by a less-than-spot-on cut fromt the gauge.) For the Woodhaven, set up took a few minutes and the miter gauge is spot-on in tests of 90 and 45 degree cuts. I recommend it."
4,"Accurate, good value","Compared to competing products, this is a great value. Mine was very accurate without tweaking. The good option, especially for those who can customize for themselves."
4,Hot and steamy,"WOW!Great acting (you know what I mean), well directed and produced, good length and variety.My only let down is the lack of extra DVD goodies. There are better titles out there than this, but this is worth a look."
5,TRACK LIST,"Therese Schroeder-Sheker / The Queen's MinstrelLabel: Windham HillYear: 1988Track Title1. Planctus Pellegrin2. Credo of Ballymacoda3. Gaude Virgo4. Assumpta est Maria in coelum5. Veni Sancte Spiritus6. Is milde Lomb7. Two Villancicos8. Choose Me9. Amor con Fortuna10. Je muir, je muir11. Ah Robyn, Gentle Robyn12. Beata Viscera13. Domino14. Sedona15. Jesu dulcis memoria"
4,"Well written, an easy read on an oft-ignored but fascinating subject.","Well worth the read; the author stumbles in a few places by looping back to the same topics over and over again, but all in all, she does an outstanding job of laying out the realities of life in the Soviet Army, and the despicable manner in which the soldiers and veterans were treated. A must read for those who argue that the Soviet system was relatively benign or misunderstood."
1,"Lots of Great Research,Very Poorly Written, Difficult to Read","This is the first book review I have given on Amazon.com. This book is so badly written I felt compelled to comment. It appears that a lot of great research from new and unique sources went into the book. But the book is so poorly written, it is difficult to read and impossible to separate fact from the author's opinion. I expect a professor to be a better writer. If she talks like she writes, I would never take a class from her :-( I have read three quarters of the book, and I am trying to decide if it would be a waste of time to finish it."
3,Humans in an inhuman war,"Definitely worth reading if you are interested in WW2. Free of patriotic propaganda (the author is British), clever, sympathetic well-informed and also, as a story, breathtaking.For those who have read so much about Nazi Germany, this is a must -- offering the another major perspective in the war that was first and foremost a clash between two major totalitarian superpowers of the era. Ivan's War can be read as a tribute to the fighting men and -women of the Soviet -- and also an apology for the atrocities they committed. Squeezed between the fighting machine of Wehrmacht and their own totalitarian regime with its draconian demands, it is amazing how many of these people managed to live, let alone keep their mental health."
3,soviet soldiers,"As for the civilian, who has exeperienced living side-by-side with soviet army some years ago, the book did not make any new revelations. It is for a reader, who wishes to look deeper into ""the russian soul"", albeit in very specific historical circumstances. The author frequently refers to a russian peasant as an individual character, although agriculture in Russia has traditionally been based on collectivist mentality.Some stories are incredible. For example, that russian couple in 1944 bought a T-34 for their life savings, and wife became a tank driver and was killed in a battle (p.214). Referring to the Baltic states, the author states that the deportations took place in 1939 (p.243), although those were carried out in 1941 after occupation of the Baltics in 1940. The final chapter gives a precise and correct observation about WWII memories, which these days in Russia build up a part of a new official state religion."
2,"Good indepth look at a soldiers life, but a slow read","This book is a very good indepth look at a soldier life, but don't look for any battle play by plays or anything overly exciting. I found that the book tended to repeat itself as the life of a russian soldier was terrible and always was. I would not add it to my collection but a good addition to a study of the Eastern Front."
2,Not very interesting,"I felt that I learned nothing new about the daily life of the average russian grunt during the war. It spoke about daily life in generalities and did not get into much of the day to day activities. The book reminded me of a bad History Channel documentary which is all fluff but no substance. I was left feeling that I had read something that has already been documented in hundreds of television shows that dealt with the war in the eastern front - ie: Stalins repressive regime, the cold Russian winters, the day to day hardships of the average Russian citizen. Do yourself a favor and buy some other book or better yet, wait for a History Channel show on the subject."
2,Not Objective,"The book reads like a recruiting pamphlet. The author needs to work on being more objective. Totally glossing over the faults and actions of the Red Army. But, I do have to say that the first hand interviews and information was quite enjoyable."
3,"The poster was great, but ""Professionally Framed"" is reaching.","I knew it was a poster, but it does claim ""Professionally Framed"", so I expected a fairly decent framing job. The poster was kind of drooping down so that the cardboard backing was showing. The poster doesn't seem quite big enough for the frame; however, I may go to Hobby Lobby for some matting. That would probably make it just right.The poster itself is everything I expected. I don't know why, but I just love that scene! Someone even said it looked like a photograph! It is a good poster.The packaging is awesome - they made sure of that. Heavy cardboard surrounded the frame, so it was very well protected.Overall, I like it...I just wish the frame job was better. The frame job is 2 stars. The poster itself is 5 stars."
1,Disappointed!!!!,"Buyers be aware! While I love the painting, be aware that if ordered through here, they will print in white font at the bottom corner the description/name of artist and the printing company. To me it sticks out like a sore thumb, especially if you have it in canvas style. The canvas style is not the painting wrap around the frame as how most conventional canvas are, it's the poster taped over black canvas material. I am seriously thinking of returning the painting and gettin it somewhere else that is recognizes that you do not print in white font on a dark background of the painting highlighting your company info."
2,Old album but I just listen!And..,"I like doom.I am fan of MDB.This product is liking to doom metal .But I think it don't. It is liking to slow ""Obituary"".It near to slow death metal.The album disappointed as usual; probably has more to with Cathedral's absence from Electric Wizard/Kyuss/Sleep level adoration within the doom/stoner genre than anything else."
1,,"Some good rocking moments here and there (especially on ""North Berwick Witch Trials"" and ""Oro the Manslayer""), but other than that Cathedral's style of Sabbath-isms combined with a sort of Southern Hard Rock groove can easily grow tired. ""The Garden"" also has its moments and strives to be different, but at 27 minutes long, it is just too long and sounds like an experiment gone wrong. Listening to some parts of this record reminded me of the funny tough-guy attitude brought by bands like Crowbar, which does not surprise considering who the producer is here. Cathedral rocks hard, but not in a way to maintain someone's interest for more than 5 minutes."
5,"Thick, protective ointment",I have sensitive skin and this works great on dry patches. This tube will last me a long time. A little goes a long way. I think it is too thick for an allover lotion. I believe this would be great on baby bottoms!
5,"great for dry, flaky eczema","I apply this over my hands that have dry, flaky eczema within minutes of exiting the shower, and it has helped bring the previously uncontrollable painful cracking under control. This is the best heavy cream to use for holding in moisture. Takes a few minutes to really absorb in to where you can comfortably handle things, but if you have major dryness issues like I do, this ointment is a godsend."
3,okay!,"The product works alright, but not nearly as good as Soothe and Cool. The other product is much betterthan this one.."
5,Best Product on the market. Highly recommendated.,Great Product. I would suggest this product for any rash or wound. Excellent healing power. I highly recomment Aloe Vesta.
5,Multi-Purpose Ointment,"Although this product is designed specifically for incontinence and such issues with bed-ridden patients, we have found it to be helpful in other, less severe medical conditions from dry skin to diaper rash to bed sores. It provides a protective barrier, keeping even skin oils or sweat from irritating skin. My only caveat would be to make sure that the area you apply it to is thoroughly clean; otherwise you might trap dangerous bacteria or toxins and cause the skin area to worsen. This product was a lifesaver when I was in an extended recovery time from surgery. I believe that Aloe Vesta comes in different formulations for different needs, even a waterless ""bath"" lotion - I would recommend any of them based on the performance of this ointment alone. My mother recently went through various breast cancer protocols and Aloe Vesta products were in the mix of items used to help ease her skin issues."
5,Great product!,"This product is great for people with rough and dry skin. It's purpose is for burns, but I use it everyday and it works wonders!"
5,aloe vista ointment,"this product is hard to find in stores, so we were excited to find it online.great product; excellent, quick service"
3,this is not an introduction,"A better title for this book would be ""Advanced Topics in Geometry"". The chapters are pretty much self-contained.This book presumes a thorough, rigorous knowledge of high school geometry such as you might get in a college geometry course designed for future teachers along with considerable mathematical maturity."
4,good discussion.,"The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because the diagrams need to be labeled. It's pretty hard to keep up with the conversation when the author refers to a poorly labeled complex diagram. I think Coxeter's other book does a great job and you can download it for free or buy it for under $10. It is a great introduction to college level geometry; and introduction because it doesn't really go into too much depth, but is not shallow either. I would recommend it, but buy it used because it's just not one of those books you'll constantly look back at for help in the future...it's pretty much a one read and that's it."
3,not really an introduction,"And not really to modern geometry, but rather to Coxeter-style geometry. I studied with Coxeter as an undergraduate (he was a very good teacher), and am a professional geometer, but I have never liked this book. Unfortunately, there is no good ""Introduction to Geometry"", and hence, 2500 years after Archimedes, still no royal road to it. I would very much recommend Thurston's notes (or his book, which is a little easier going, but has a lot less content), or (on a more basic level) Geometric Transformations by Yaglom."
1,"Wonderful book, outrageous price","I have the first edition of this book and learned much of what I know of Geometry from it. As a book, I highly recommend it.But the price is absurdly high!!! It it a reprint, in paperback, and less than 500 pages. There is no way that it should be more than $30!Charging $97 is just pure greed on the part of the publisher.Shame on Wiley."
5,Go WIthin or Go WIthout,"Gloria writes in a straight-forward, heart warming, style. It's a powerful book that will seem as innocent & approachable as chocolate chip cookies & milk. Lessons are taught on multiple levels, depending on what the reader wants from the book.It can entertain, make you smile, make you wonder, and open up areas in one's mind to the possibilities within. Like a pebble tossed into the universal ""pond"" of the mind, the words ripple out to touch other thoughts within the reader. And within the next reader. It is sent out into the world with the hopeful promise of sharing--planting the seeds for possible inner change.If is offered to the world like a smile--if one person smiles and causes 2 others to smile, and those two cause 2 others to smile, the effect is exponential. This book makes me smile."
1,Poor Packaging,"I was so excited to receive this and give it as a gift. It was gorgeous...until I noticed the foot was broken off. The Styrofoam lining they used was ripped to pieces, I'm assuming that's the cause of the broken foot. Considering this was to be gifted in 2 days returning and getting a replacement in time isn't possible. More than a little disappointed."
2,International star,"I have loved a lot of voices from far away Countries for long time:Brazil,Portugal,Senegal;they were stars nationally and internationnally.Recently I bought Cesaria Evora under the recommendation of a cuban Doctor;I hoped to find some of the rythm I used to swing on in my head.It did not happen for me!"
5,My New Favorite CD,"I bought this CD in France in June; I love the style and the duets with such wonderful French artists as Charles Aznavour, Renaud, Johnny Hallyday, Francis Cabrel and Jean-Jacques Goldman. If you like music from the 30's and 40's, you will surely enjoy these remakes. Some of them are very jazzy but they never depart too far from the original style. When I listen to this music I feel like I'm back in Paris, not only in space but in time."
4,Bruel sings the French music of the 1930's through the 1950's,"What a wonderful introduction to the great French singers of the 1930's through the 1950's! I loved hearing the songs that were made famous by Charles Trenet, Jean Sablon, Arletty, Frehel, Yves Montand, Tino Rossi, Maurice Chevalier etc.There are wonderful songs here, well interpreted by Bruel by himself and with guest artists. I especially loved ""La Complainte de la Butte"" a song written by Jean Renoir for his movie ""French Cancan""; ""Quand on se promene au bord de l'eau"" is a very lively rendition of a song made famous by Jean Gabin.Bruel does duets with Charles Aznavour, Danielle Darrieux, Alain Souchon, Jean-Jacques Goldman,Francois Cabrel, Zazie and other well-known artists.These songs bring back a former era of great French singers and song. This CD is worth buying if you like French music."
2,un cd totalement nul; une honte pour la France,"- Un cd totalement impossible à endurer... Seules 2 chansons sur 24 sont supportables: le duo avec Aznavour et celui avec Aubert. Bruel, en faisant ce cd, nous prouve qu'il n'a jamais su chanter; et surtout, qu'il fait honte à la France en chantant de tels classiques. Un album à éviter à tout prix; si vous désirez vous détruire les tympans, achetez-le.- An unbearable cd, though 2 songs out of 24 are not bad: the duet with Aznavour and the one with Aubert. By doing this cd, Bruel proves that he has never been able to sing; and most of all that he is an embarrassment to France when singing such classics. An album to be avoided at all costs; buy at your own risk, if you wish to bust your ears."
3,Lid Wrench,I bought these as gifts for family members. I haven't heard how they are working for them. I use a nut cracker to open small bottles.
3,A Good Wrench,"This simple style jar wrench that works every time, H-A-D been around for years but when I went to look for a new one, none were to be found at any or our wonderous massive retailers, i.e., Walmart, Target, K-Mart, and not even the dollar stores. They have simply dissappeared off store shelves, so came to Amazon and found what I need.However at $8 this is an overpriced implement and also about a third larger in size than those of yore, for which I can fathom no reason. However, they do work as does this one and as I could find them nowhere else I coughed up the money. I do recommed it and would have given five stars had it not been for the exhorbitant price."
4,Great Characters...,"I love Matt Lucas and David Walliams so I fgured Id check out their new series. Its not as good as Little Britain, but for its place and setting it was still a good series. I think they should have used some different ideas as far as some characters as opposed to the same general idea each episode.... Overall though, it was 'Precious' lol I enjoyed it and it did make me laugh. These guys are GREAT!!! =)"
3,Good for a lazy Sunday,Every episode is more or less the same but it is just great material for an easy laid back Sunday!
3,I owned the same thing once,"The one I had a few years ago was a bit less expensive, and it was nicer. This one loses air for no reason after each use....annoying."
3,OK for the price,"Pros:-Cheap-Software works on my VISTA laptop-Small (plugs into USB)-Works OK-Works on both NTSC and PAL formats, nice if you travel.Cons:-If you are not careful it would be easy to overtorque the USC connection if plugged directly into your computer due to weight of adaptor and cable/antenna connection. Best to use an USB extension cable to hook to your computer to avoid damage - especially laptops.-HyperMedia software is clunky. No way to resize the window (basically impossible to place a small window in corner of your desktop). No ability to re-order or delete channels after scanning so news channels are together, movie channels are together, fuzzy channels are deleted, etc.-Haven't tried this myself but I understand it won't work with Vista Media Center. You are locked into the HyperMedia software which is clunky (see above).Overall it works and is the only tuner I found that does both PAL and NTSC."
1,Don't buy this useles software,The company had to remove the ripper from the program by law. Now it's even less useful than before when it merely was buggy. You can download the freeware program DVD Shrink to do everything this does and better.
1,Disappointed customer,"Without the ability to rip, this software is useless. Fact is you can't copy your protected DVD. High price for a product that doesn't keep what it promises!"
1,DO NOT BUY-FRAUDULENT,"I purchased this product last week, and it was supposed to have the ripper in it. Now when I tried to use it, it says that it cannot copy my dvd. When I went to the 321 website they could not offer any help. Thus, this product is a fraud, and it cannot back up a movie. DO NOT BUY unless you want to waste your money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM,The company 321 studios maker of all dvd x copy products is out of business as of end of august 2004. Therefore you can not activate the program on your computer and it is unusable. There is no more customer service or technical support available to even past customers who bought the program years ago. Other than that it is a fantastic program.
1,Do you want a DVD copier?,If so buy 321 studios DVD X Copy!! It works flawlessly have two cd-roms of it myself and have yet to find a flaw..just wish that the government would keep there nose outta private lives and let this program stay legal...but
5,Imagine a Japanese Anne Perry,"Like the Inspector Monk series by Anne Perry, which is set in Victorian England, this book is much more character- and culture-driven than plot-driven, which may be why one reviewer complained about the slow pace. There are many similaries between 1960s Japan and Victorian England, too. It's socially unacceptable to ask pointed questions; often what people don't say is more important than what they do. Women are stereotyped as fragile flowers in need of protection, despite their behavior to the contrary. And policemen are somewhat looked down upon, as though soiled by the act of crime solving. I'd much rather read a book like this, well written and from a new, culturally unfamiliar perspective, than the 47th fast-action, formulaic potboiler by an author who's long since run out of fresh ideas."
3,Kinda typical Japanese novel...yawn.....,"I spent more than several years in Japan. I've read more than several Japanese authors. I'm an ex-investigator. I love murder mysteries. Dick Francis, and there's a Chinese author I just love to read... But, I found to no surprise that this novel was no mystery. Like Japanese telling a joke in 45 min. with a punch line Westerners are not able to comprehend, this book was the same.... without a punch-line.SLOW...REPETITIVE....Did I say SLOW? The whole thing could have been written in 10 pages if you wanted to get wordy..... sorry, I hoped for more, but ""ie""."
4,Old Hickory Chef's Knife,"The blade of this knife rusts easily. Be prepared to hand wash and dry this beautiful piece immediately after use. And be prepared to see tarnishing however careful you are. Still, the steel takes a better edge than my German made knives, and the rusticity of its fashion helps me attend my cooking. Friends, it's Zen."
5,too bad they don't make them anymore!,these were really one of the best cheep knives you could buy.It is truly a shame that they are no longer making the cook versions of these.
4,A good second utility knife for the kitchen,"This is not Wustoff, or even Lamson quality, but it does the job. I rate it as a good second chef's knife to have in the kitchen. I bought it for $7.00, and it does the job fine. Haven't had the rust issue that the first poster claimed, just some staining on the blade is all. This should easily be removed when I sharpen the blade."
5,A book for christians and non christians alike......,"This book has been a real eye opener, alot of people can relate to the way the author puts faith into practical expirences. It is a must have for anyone entering or in law enforcement or any branch of the military. There are alot of valuable lessons in this book that put into perspective how far you'r faith can carry you through difficult situations and hardships. Bottom line, if you have spent this much time reading reviews and descriptions about the book, just get it."
1,A Different Title for the Bible.,"This book is rather misleading. You will this to be great reading if your a ""Bible Thumper"". However, if your looking for something written about the military, this is NOT the book."
3,Becoming a Warrior for God,Overall enjoyed this book. was looking for a bit more Biblical warrior correlations to today's warriors. was a bit slow in some places. good current day illustrations of being Bulletproof & your mind stayed on HIM.
2,Unreadable if you're not Christian,"For better or for worse, this book is not your standard personal growth tome. It is by a Christian, for Christians (only), and your enjoyment of it will vary accordingly.Almost everything in this book premised on belief in Christ -- both in how Holton approaches fear and how he advises others to do so -- and if you don't accept Jesus as your savior, his advice and insights are completely useless.If you're Christian (I'm not), you might find this aspect of it to be a net positive."
2,Bullet proof should have been called Bullet Resistant,"The book promises a lot. But the title is very misleading. What the book should have been called is ""Bullet Proof: The making of an Invincible Soul"". The books is about finding and trusting in God instead of ones self which is great but not what I was looking for. I am very disappointed."
3,"Not ""the"" Suicide Commandos; not a review","Just wanted to try to alert the unwary:This is not the original Suicide Commandos, the proto punk band from Minneapolis in the mid 70s. Pretty annoying when new bands yoink names from defunct classic units from days gone by. The Band Name Tree was picked bare years ago, I suppose."
4,A little bit of every other book.,"This book seems to have sketches of just about everything to do with Shelter. I have seen most of these pictures in full colourat one time or another after having read lots of other books on architecture, but it is quite nice to have them all sorted out inone book, each with a short description."
5,Treehouse nuts!,"My daughter and son-in-law have been talking about building a tree house to live in for years. This was on a wish list, so I got it and they just loved it! Gave them lots of good ideas."
5,definitive of the neo-beat movement,"hotel sterno is sheer genius... wickedly humorous and imaginative. This is clever prose with a plotline, not a mere drop in the bucket. Jeff Little's cheeky lodge is a regular three ring circus of fun. This one was worth the wait."
4,Good tool for the price!,"I did a lot of research on small planers and came to the conclusion that I probably will need a 15"" ar larger planer at some point, but did not have the budget today to pop for a larger model. As such, I went with this Grizzly G0505, figuring that it would work well enough for my immediate projects and cheap enough that I would not feel bad about replacing it someday.Right out of the box, this little guy has been great. While not as fancy as the Delta and Dewalt models, it was easy enough to set up and has been working really well. At almost half the price of the Delta and Dewalt models, definitely a good buy."
3,"Grizzly G0505 12-1/2"" Planer","This is my third Grizzly product, and first planer. I have used my brother in laws larger planer in the past, but didn't feel like driving 80 miles one way every time I needed wood planed. So I bought the GO505, and it is pretty basic, no frills, it works well enough, but I wish I had spent more and gotten a larger model. I feel the feed rate is to fast on the GO505, on a wide board, it only takes a half a turn on the crank to make it grunt, wide boards tend to make it labor if the depth is turned more then a half a turn per cut. I just wish I had spent a little more on a bigger model."
2,Worked Great,"It was an absolute joy to use for the week or so that it worked. Quiet, powerful, smooth-cutting - in general did an excellent job, though I didn't ask too much of it at first. But then a week or so after unpacking it it simply didn't turn on in the morning, and a few weeks of dealing with customer service later - I got a replacement part, installed it, nothing changed - I had wasted so much time and energy that I had to hand out the money for a new planer. I had a job that couldn't be held up any longer by a useless planer. I assume that this was a total fluke, and that the tool is in general quite solid and reliable, but I'm still quite frustrated by the experience. In the meantime, my new Dewalt planer, which cost 150 dollars more or so, is louder, uglier, messier, bulkier, and less pleasant to use and have around the shop. But so far, it's turned on every time I've flicked the switch, so I can't really complain."
2,Disappointed,"This is my first Grizzly power tool, which I purchased based on the rave reviews. Out of the box, I tried to plane twelve-inch maple wide for shelving. The first few passes using small incremental cuts resulted in the wood jamming, getting marred with paint and grease, and a few tear-outs. Not a good start.The jamming was caused by poor manufacturing. In the outfeed of the unit, there are two metal studs that seem to hold the board down as it exits. On my planer, one of these studs was 1/16"" longer than the other, causing the jams and cutting into the wood. Had to file the stud down just to get the wood to pass through. I still have problems with the wood getting stained with green paint and gouges.Not sure what to think of Grizzly power tools. I should have payed more for a better unit, probably not a Grizzly."
1,bad experience,"I drove a little over an hour to the grizzly store to purchase the G0505 planer. I was very impressed with the quality of the build (all metal). After i got it home and unpacked it I plugged it in and turned it on. Immediately I noticed the motor was very loud and had a grinding sound to it, like something was loose. It turns out that the Craftsman model that I was replacing, though not a rugged, was much smoother running and produced a nicer finish. I was very disappointed in the Grizzly, I just couldn't believe that it would have such a cheap universal motor on such a well built piece of equipment."
1,Should have known,"I bought my first one 3 years ago it held up fine for a bit, then the over load switch kept kicking when I was only planning 1/32 off of pine it continued to kick on every pass or it wouldn't feed it through to the machine's credit my guys work tools pretty hard so I figured they just over did it a few times. So I bought another bad mistake it started kicking the overload the first day when I was taking it easy, Ive yet to find a good portable planer that a professinal can use everyday without down time."
2,Not one of the best episodes of a remarkable Sci-Fi show.,"When the ship's archaeoligist dies on a mission, Worf has the sad duty of informing the woman's son. However, when the 12 year old is mourning the loss of his mother, his mother suddenly reappears and wants to take him down to the planet. But is she what she appears to be?"
4,great resource,Nice overview of Japanese sword history. Some of the diagrams are not that clear to follow. Pictures and footwork look different to me sometimes. Overall good to have for reference if studying Aikido Toho Iai. Doesn't replace training with a certified instructor.
4,Can be helpful,"The volume covers all the fifteen kata of Aiki Toho Iai, a series of Japanese sword forms created or adopted from other iaido schools by the late Shoji Nishio sensei, one of aikido's greatest innovators.The book also contains chapters dedicated to the interpretations of those kata in taido (unarmed techniques) as well as several ken tai ken (sword vs. sword) forms. Michael Russ did a tremendous job preparing this book and kudos to him for that. The written instructions are very thorough, often concentrating on little details, which is very important, as iaid is all about details. The photographs accompanying the text are of very good quality, clearly illustrating the issues described in the text.""Aikido Toho Iai"" is a very valuable learning tool for any Nishio Aikido enthusiast. It won't of course replace the actual dojo practice overviewed by a capable sensei, but can be a great reference resource. Highly recommended."
4,The shape of music to come,"If you wanted to look into the future from back in 1986 and see in what direction music might be heading, all you had to do was to pick up ""Transit."" Stein and Walder were WAY ahead of the curve. How do I know? There was a young Bruce Hornsby singing on the LP, and Dawn Atkinson contributed vocals and electronic percussion. Joining Bruce and Dawn were Mark Isham and Mike Manring. When you have that kind of support on an album that tells me a great deal. But don't take my word for it - I've only been playing and enjoying music for some three and a half decades. Take a chance. Give 'Foreign Correspondence' an unbiased listen, remembering you're listening to a sound that first came out on LP in 1986. Then enjoy every tasty cut."
4,"Close, but not quite (to 5 stars)","The gameshark is good for cheats, such as, invincibility and infinite ammo, but my games lock up a lot when I use it. Its worth it though. There is one other problem with it, new codes. It the code is very complex it can take forever to type it in. If you are going to use the gameshark for older games it is great, but if you plan on using it for newer games remember, you will probabaly have to enter them yourself. Overall the gameshark works well."
2,Waste of money,"This Gameshark is just like the Action replay I already have for my PSOne, but the description did not say that. If I'd have known, I wouldnt have wasted my money on it."
3,not all that,"i've played many games and used this game-enhancer, sure it has a large number of games listed but ot al of the codes let you play, some will freeze up and you'll end up frustrated as i was, i even e=mailed game- shark.com and expressed my dissapointment and i never got a response, so much for that huh?"
3,"Good For Playstation, Bad For PS1","Gameshark CDX is a great cheatmachine for regular PSX, but for PS1 players it's not. PS1 players are not able to use GS CDX because there is no port for any Gameshark in the PS1. To PS1 players, I reccomend the new Gameshark product from Interact, ""Gameshark Lite"". Rather than a simple cartridge, the Gameshark Lite is more like a boot disc. You just stick it in the PS1, load the codes for a specific game and swap your game with the Gameshark Lite while the PS1 is still running."
1,Not what I was told it was for?,"This item was suppose to have the Cheat Codes for Gran Turismo (1st version)...it did not have any version, at all? Also, got the codes from the Internet and entered them to the ""T""...it did not work either? Followed the instructions in the book, over and over...all fricken day to the ""T"" and nada man! Do these darn things even work? Is there anywhere or anyone that I can go on the web to check this crap out or explain what in the world I'm doing wrong? (youtube...maybe) Not a happy camper at this point! Spent mucho money first on a Codebreaker, it did not function...now money on this piece of crap! Can anybody assist here? It's for Play Station (1995 Grey Box) and both games are Gran Turismo (version 1.1) and Gran Turismo 2. May god bless the one person that can clarify or get this to work for me? The rest of you, thanks for the support by listening to me b...h!"
3,Classic,"I recently bought a lot of classic PS1 games and wanted to complete it by buying the Gameshark adapter I once had. It works great, still has plenty of cheat codes in there for the 'ole classic games. A little pricey though, but worth in my mind."
1,Warning: Not compatible with PSone!,"Don't make the mistake I did and trust this product's tag line: ""For Use With All PlayStation Game Counsels.""Nothing could be further from the truth.In a true snub to PSone gamers, the Game Shark CDX is not compatible with the new, redesigned PlayStation models. While this game-cheat device may work fine on the older, PSX models, but expect failure -- if not saved game file corruption -- on the PSone.There was nary a game in my nearly 20-title collection which benefited in any way from the Game Shark CDX. Cheats which touted ""infinate life"" on Resident Evil 2 REFUSED to function; a code which should have brought me ""unlimited gold"" in Castlevania NEVER worked; and hacks which should have made Final Fantasy VII a breeze CORRUPTED my saved games.If I sound bitter, it's because I am. This product was a quick waste of money I could have spent in a hundred better ways.Suffice to say that I will never again trust any products from Interact."
3,"Another reviewer mentions ""missing a few teeth' - well said!","If you don't have a SCPH-900x series Playstation, do whatever you can to get the Gameshark Pro instead of the CDX. The CDX does not have what is considered to be one of the most essential features of the Pro: the ability to find your own codes, live, as the game is being played. Once you have experienced this power, nothing else compares. If you do have a 900x series unit (with the parallel port removed), consider the product review to be 3.5, *maybe* 4 stars. (Extra warning: If you have an older 100x unit, the CDX is strongly advised against.)If you can use a GS Pro and find one somewhere, get that while you still can!! They're becoming rare due to popularity, as well as no small amount of politics. Otherwise, the CDX can serve you fairly well...usually. And forget the official website... There is MUCH better available. :)"
3,Good And Bad,"i think that this gameshark is very helpful. i mostly use it for Driver 2, but thats just because its the most recent game i bought. All of the other reviews on here state that it freezes the game. for the first 3-4 hours for me, it didnt freeze at all. But then it did. and it wouldnt stop, or let me do anything. and when u have to restart, you lose all your unsaved game settings and data, and you have to reload through the gameshark, just so it can freeze again. i think its worth buying this though, because you probably cant find a better one. I wouldnt recommend buying it used though. If you decide to buy it, then buy it here, or somewhere that has it for the same price, or even less. I would also recomend that u should check to see if gameshark is coming out with a new version, without these glitches."
5,WOW ITS SIMPLY AMAZING,"WOW, I cant believe this thing game shark is a god! with this cool toy games can be reached to there full extent no more hard parts that cant be beat you just pop this in and bang your ready to go. the only downside is if you have a ps 1000 it doesnt work well, but for the rest of us it is awesome! Thank you gameshark for such a great experiance cant wait till the ps2 game shark comes out!!"
2,Mediocre,"Re-doing my last Review, after working with the program for a little while found its capabilities to be mediocre but not ground breaking. Again, using the codes the have been pre-entered are extremely limiting and some dont even work, causing your game to crash. An improvement I found though not very good is that, yes, you can input codes you have found off the net and such, but too many will automatically freeze the game, whether in 2 minutes or maybe up to an hour, I managed to only get 4 codes I desired onto one game, dont limit yourself, This Gameshark is not the best out there, keep looking is my suggestion."
3,Cheating has never been this fun...sometimes.,"Ok the gameshark is actually a great thing to have around to help you in a tricky situation by giving you infinte health, ammo, hidden characthers etc. but don't be surprised if it locks up on one of your games.I sure was surprised.Locking up means that your screen freezes, thus not allowing you to progress any farther.Whether during an introduction movie or just after the ""sony computer entertainment"" plays, it can freeze.That's what weakens my view of this semi-helpful, semi-annoying cheating device."
4,"Dependable, but Slow...","When I first bought this the memory card didn't fit properly in the slot at all, so i returned it and the next one fit but I had to jiggle it around a bit to get the program to recognize it. Still i haven't had any major problems. The only bad thing is that it takes a long time to enter in each and every line of code. Codes for games like Gran Turismo 2 are made up of a LOT of lines. I gave up trying to enter codes for Final Fantasy 9, which were made up of about 100 lines."
2,GAME SHARK EXTRA CODE CD'S?,"I mainly play rpg (FFVII VIII RE RE2 REN ETC ...)I am impressed with the number of codes on the cd that came with the GS CDX,but where are the new cd's with the new codes and will this game shark work with the PS2? I 'll have to wait and see until then the shark is missing a few teeth and I can only give the GAME SHARK CDX two and a half stars."
4,They work as advertised.,"I'm always apprehensive about buying these battery lights because they never live up to my expectations. I have to say that these little lights work really well and I love the spots. The biggest challenge is getting the magnet lined up with the light. If they aren't lined up correctly, the light won't go off. Having to move the lights or magnets around more than a couple of times really takes a toll on the double-stick tape.They aren't as bright as they look in the advertisements but they do the job. Overall a good product."
4,"Fun, but you get what you pay for.","These lights are so inexpensive I don't care that some of them don't last long. The bonus spotlights are actually kind of neat, but the automatic drawer lights are my favorite. I used them to light all the drawers in my kitchen and it created a ""millionaire"" effect for about $15 dollars. Each drawer casts a modern blue glow when opened, and makes it much easier to see what's inside at night or when the lights are down for movie night.-The sticky pad on several of them didn't hold on for long, but I just bought some new 3M foam squares and they haven't fallen since.-The batteries are replaceable so they don't qualify as one-time use lights, but they're so inexpensive that somebody might choose to go that route.NOTE: If the light won't activate when you pull out the plastic tab, don't throw it away without first trying to move the batteries around in their compartment! I found several that just needed a little turn of the batteries to work."
5,really neat,These lights make it so much easier to get in and out of drawers and find things when I get up in the dark and my husband is still sleeping
5,Our favorite doll,"We have bought two other Little Mommy dolls and our girls love them. These dolls have very pretty faces and are soft for the kids to play with (soft body). Their arms, legs, and heads also wipe clean easily. The only complaint I have is that I haven't found clothes made for them. I highly recommend the Little Mommy doll for little girls age 1 and up."
4,Good doll for my 1 year old,"I am Causasian and my wife is Filipino and the doll looks a lot like our 1 year old daughter. This doll is well suited for a 1 year old except that the headband comes off. This doll was so much cheaper on Amazon. I read a review that said some other doll was cheaper on e-bay but when I checked it was more than twice as expensive. Also, the Little Mommy Dolls are more expensive in the stores. This was my first toy purchase on Amazon and I was well pleased."
4,I love that it's not a regular baby doll,"I am not Asian by any stretch of the imagination, but I wanted a doll for my little girl that wasn't your plain Jane bald baby doll with blue eyes that didn't cost a fortune. (for my 2 yo, I don't want to spend 40 bucks on a doll..)This doll delivers. She's sweet looking, her clothes are bright and colorful, she smells nice (thankfully the vanilla fades a bit after time) and she's soft and perfect for little girls to carry around. She doesn't look like other baby dolls and that's what I like, everyone knows who doll this is.I do wish her head was a bit softer, but as long as my daughter isn't trying to swing her around, it's all good."
4,Watch out if you have pets,"Much better price than our local store or tv and my daughter (7) loved them, but boy oh boy, we have cats and those things get pet hair stuck to them so easily! We did throw some into our road trip bag and they are great for entertaining on a long trip. My daughter was able to follow the directions to make specific animals and also had fun making her own creations and sticking them to her wall. There wasn't any residue when I finally took them off the wall, but for whatever reason, they did do a little damage to the wood finish on her door - so paint, okay, wood, no. Would recommend these and I am sure my girls are ready for more."
5,My 10 year old loves these,"I cannot for the life of me figure out WHY a box of these is almost $20. After all, they are just little strips of waxy yarn or something like that! But, the fact is, my 10 year old son loves them, and will play with them for HOURS at a time, so I guess it's worth it?? He recently built a very cool Buzz Lightyear that looked just like him! He is very creative with these, and he actually plays with the items he builds. So, his Buzz Lightyear is now a homemade action figure that he plays with often! I think that is a winner with me; a toy that stimulates his creativity, AND gives him the ability to play with his creations."
4,Great for my 7 and 3 year olds,"My kids really enjoy these - they are fun to make things, and don't make a mess (which I love). It came with some instructions for ideas, and they can make many things on their own. They stick on the wall without leaving any residue, and so far can be reused without any problem."
5,Wonderful,My daughter used these during her student teaching in a kindergarten classroom to teach a Math lesson. She had instant success!
5,Great toy!,"I bought these Wikki Stix to use with my 2nd grade special education students. I thought we could use them to make spelling words, or answers to math facts and it would be something new and interesting to help learning. My students LOVE them and ask to play with them all the time - even during free time!! It's great to see them using their imaginations! I've only had them for a month or so, but so far, they are very durable (and the kids are tough on them)! I'm going to buy a smaller set for my niece and my friends daughter (one 4 yr. old and one 5 yr. old) for their birthdays in the summer! Would definitely recommend them to anyone!"
2,Disappointing,My son has been begging me to buy him more of these wikki stix ever since he got some for free at a restaurant with his kids meal. So I went ahead and bought this box set and disappointed by its non stickiness. It sticks but not as well as the ones he gets at the restaurant and it's frustrating for him when he's trying to make things out of it because it keeps coming apart. I don't know if this particular one that was sold to me is just old or what but I don't recommend this.
2,BENDAROOS are NOT THE SAME,"I bought bendaroos due to a reviewer saying they are the same as Wikki Stix except tons cheaper. I found them to be 3-4 times cheaper, but also much less fun to play with. You pay for what you get, if you know what I mean. The Bendaroos are impossible to keep stuck together. A source of frustration for my kids and I. Stick with Wikki Stix. There is a reason why they cost more."
3,Ok but not great,"These are just okay, nothing great about them. I've found it difficult to get them to stick to each other when trying to make 3-D animals. Then do stick to walls and don't leave a mess, which is a plus."
3,"I like it, but...","We bought these for Christmas for my 5-year old. I am very happy with the price, the quality, the quanity, and the concept. I had some with me while we were waiting in line and it definitely kept her busy. But at home, they sit like most everything else we get. So, they're great, but only if your child is intested enough to use them."
1,It's just sticky yarn,These things will end up all over your house - in carpets and rugs and the vacuum cleaner. The kids get bored with them fairly quickly.I don't recommend these or any other brand.
2,"Just the facts, ma'am","What a bore this book is. No sense of style (welll, it's a translation after all). No sense of narrative line. Just facts printed on the page. If you want the facts, here they are. I'd suggest you wait for the movie."
4,"Very Informative, But Dry","This book is very wordy. Not in a verbose kind of way, but is richly informative. In fact, if you were to take it seriously and read every word, you would take a week to get from cover to cover. This is not really for the beginner as much of it is IMO appreciated only after you've played the bass for a while. I'd say, if you've been playing for at least a year or so, go ahead and get it. You'll have a few revelations of things you never understood (or even knew about), and be reinforced in other areas. Great book."
4,Fun for Brothers,I have a 5 year old and an eight year old who used Christmas money to buy this together three days ago. They have played with it nonstop since. It is easy for them to set up and play on their own and they have a blast. If someone is having trouble with this perhaps they should read the directions.
1,completely lame!,"as cool as these little cars are i was hoping for a lot more out of this track. the launcher is weak and does not launch the cars with sufficient speed to make it through the loop. i bought this toy and tried it out at least 15-20 times, thinking that i was just doing it wrong or didn't have the perfect alignment. no matter what i did, i was not able to make this toy work satisfactorily. haven't taken it out of the box since the day i got it and wish i hadn't spent the money. not a good product."
1,Ouch!,"I bought these shoes because I loved the color and I enjoy Reebok clothing. These are awful shoes! Playing basketball is literally impossible. These shoes also dig into your feet, and they hurt after awhile."
2,Falls apart and NO NOODLE,"Despite being included in the product photo and no disclaimer indicating that the noodle is not included, it's not.OK, moving on from that, we took this fun little chair to the pool on our vacation. The front straps tend to want to fall off the smaller noodles but it did make a very comfortable chair for floating around in the pool. However by about day six seams were stretching open and one strap on one side broke off. The chair was still usable but it's life expectancy is now very limited.I don't expect much from a $15 item but I did expect more than a few hours use before it started to fall apart. And considering this device is used with a noodle in water, a users weight does not effect the durability of the product, all stress is only caused by the buoyancy of the noodle."
3,Just OK,The chair has a tendancy to come off of the noodle. I found myself constantly putting it back on.I have had another brand that sits deeper and stays on better. I will buy that one next time.
1,not worth it,I was very disappointed with this. Two mesh seat type things you need to buy noodles for it to work. Not pleased. We threw them in trash.
3,No noodle!,I won't know til the pool is installed how this works out. I do know the chair does not come with a noodle.
3,I have had problems getting good results,"The directions are pretty terrible and probably I don't get great results because I'm not doing something correctly. After several attempts I have concluded that I get better results using the manufacturer supplied profiles. However, if you don't have those profiles because of the brand of paper or printer you are using then this is an inexpensive alternative to having profiles professionally created for you."
4,typical victronox quality,"it does well,not much to be said.its very thin. but pairing knives usually are.wish the handle was bigger."
5,more hooks than my tackle box,"The Fall-Outs have done it again. Not just another flash in the pan, The Fall-Outs crank out yet another great album. I truly believe these guys are one of the best ""unknown"" bands around. From they're early work on ""Here I come & Other Hits"" which is Fast & Crunchy, through self-titled ""The Fall Outs"" which is even Crunchier & the punkest of their Power Pop albums, ""Sleep"" has more hooks than my tackle box and more crunch than the Cap'n. The newest release ""Summertime"" which keeps their beautiful crunch with, dare I say, sophisticated hooks & harmonies. After a couple of listens, ""Summertime"" had me along for the ride."
4,Decent Machine,"As with another poster, I was looking at 14"" machines and the G0513 was only a little more expensive, so I took the plunge. It was my first Grizzly tool, so I was a little nervous.The machine arrived with no damage or any other problem.My only compaints, and thus the 4 stars are: 1) the plastic handwheels (tension and cutting height) look and feel cheap. 2) the blade guides are somewhat chinsey. After getting them properly adjusted, I find the thumbscrews will work loose. If I overtighten the thumbscrews, the guides do not rotate properly. This has become a recurring problem, and I may contact Grizzly to resolve. Other competetive machines, such as the Jet 16"" have a better adjustment system with jam nuts. 3) the table brackets (trunnions) are stamped steel. I expected a little beefier cast iron construction.Overall the saw cuts very well and has plenty of power."
4,So far so good.,"So far I am very happy with the saw. I will say that I agree with the gentleman who says that the fence leaves a lot to be desired. If I were Grizzly I'd fix that deficiency even if I had to charge a little more for the package. I may purchase a Kreg fence but for now I'll try and live with the one supplied.I run the saw at the recommended 220v. which I believe make a big difference in performance. I chose this saw because it will take a 1"" blade and I plan to use it (95% of the time) for resawing. My resaw efforts so far have been very sucessful.I see this machine as a very good value."
5,A most evocative book,"This is an epic narrative of a single evening in the Argentine night mail service. The chief character is the air manager, with peripheral characters being pilots, pilots' wives, and other personnel. Without spoiling the plot, an unexpected crisis occurs in the way of a trans-Andean storm, and the pace quickens to unforgettable climax.But read the book. It's short, and not so much as a phrase is excess weight. A spine-tingling thriller about men in crisis, and the women who wait alone. You may grimace at the manager's resolve, but you will never forget him or the pilot coming from far southern Argentina. A masterful insight into the days when character was a desirable thing and profit wasn't the only motive for excellence."
4,Absorbing and exhilarating,"This is a shortish novel about the pioneers of mail flying from South America to Europe. The plot is absorbing, the characters are masterfully sketched, and his turn of phrase is at times exhilarating. Here's one example: ""The seconds flowed away, like ebbing blood. Were they still in flight? Each second killed a hope."""
2,Night Flight- so/so for me,"I enjoyed parts of it. For my own taste, he spent too much time in introspection, slow-moving thought, and losing the story line. For others it might be a brilliant psychlogical book, but I read it as a pilot looking for interesting perspectives on flight and was a bit disappointed."
2,Night Flight,"I was extremely disappointed when this product arrived. As a child, I can remember fondly my Dad reading this book by Antoine de St. Exupery to me and had always wanted to own it. The description offered by Amazon was Used-Acceptable and a hardcover book. What arrived was in dismal condition, paperback, with pages falling out! I contacted the seller and we determined that Amazon's description was incorrect. The seller credited me the $10 purchase price and made things right. I deeply appreciate their efforts and spent the credit on other books. This $10 was more than I'd ever paid for a book purchase on Amazon (I usually get used books for $.01 because they're NOT ""keepers""). It was a learning experience, but I will continue to shop at Amazon because of the great prices."
5,Homelessness as social rebellion,"David Wagner accurately portrays a well-organized homelessness community and the less known aspects of homeless. The book counters the media's image that the homeless lack a social network, that they are all simply drug addicts or mentally ill. Its greatest strenghth lies in its detailed descriptions of homeless people, which Wagner gathered from his own experiences with a homeless commnity (presumably Portland,Maine)."
5,Excellent,I knew when I ordered this book that it would be good. I am very pleased to have this book and very glad to add it to my collection of cross stitch and embroidery books.
1,Flambeau 5005st Tackle Station,This would be a great tackle station if they sent me the one I ordered NOT 1 TIME BUT 2 TIMES .FREE SHIPPING NO!!! I WAS CHARGED $19.00 EACH TIME. THEY HAVE $160.00 BUT I DON'T HAVE MY CHRISTMAS GIFT!!!!!!
2,A little misleading,"I ordered this outfit to take on vacation to Colorado. Thought it would not only be warm but cute. It is called a pant set but the pants were not even long enough to be capris. I even ordered a little big to make sure the 'pants' would be long enough (our daughter is a little tall)On a brighter note, the fabric was soft and the print was adorable."
5,heavenly scent,I had seen Lollia products in boutique(pricey)and also had received a full size perfume and hand cream as a gift in their grapefruit scent.I really loved the sugared pastille and when I saw an offer through Amazon to get a petite size perfume and hand cream I grabbed it!
1,Boring music hides Luis' beautiful passionate voice,"The music was really bad. . .it sounded like cocktail party music. After listening to ""El Idolo de Mexico,"" which I was absolutely taken by, I was expecting a moving, passionate Luis Miguel with his rich, beautiful voice, and instead I almost fell asleep to ""Romances"". Aren't they supposed to be romantic and full of passion? How is someone suppose to feel romantic if he/she is falling asleep to it?"
1,Not worth any sort of review,This cd is nothing but a let-down. I was hugely dissapointed in the lack of creativity.
1,Randy A.,"Was very disappointed when I received this CD with another from this artist. Product arrived quickly after order was placed. Both CDs did come wrapped properly, only problem is when I took wrapping off this CD and opened it the was no CD inside. Just a plastic case. Company was not going to replace since they don't believe I am telling the truth. I have my concerns purchasing any CDs on Amazon again, for fear my money will be lost, and I will get no product."
5,LUIS MIGUEL ES UN AMOR,"JAMAS HABIA ESCUCHADO ALGO TAN BELLO Y SENSUAL COMO ""LOS ROMANCES"" DE LUIS MIGUEL... DIFINITIVAMENTE, ES EL CANTANTE DE LA DECADA! I NEVER IMAGINED LUIS MIGUEL TO TOP HIS FIRST CD ON ROMANCE BUT HE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. HOW CAN ANYONE COMPETE WITH HIS MAJESTY. PLEASE, TAKE DENVER, COLORADO INTO CONSIDERATION ON HIS NEXT TOUR. WE WOULD LOVE TO HOST HIM."
5,Out of 14 tracks there are no misses,This CD is a very well balanced compilation of the very best romantic songs which have you playing time after time. Not many CD's have all tremendous tracks but you will find this one has.
5,Pleasurable,This man can sing. His voice is extremely pleasing to a woman's ear. His passion is evident and it is by far one of the most sexy and I mean sexy voices I've ever heard. Vivo Luis Miguel!
4,Great,"This is a great timer, only problem is seeing in dark, needs LED on panel... Delvery was on time. Detailies specific were right ON."
5,A must read for everyone!,"Mr. Roberts treats this subject like a master. His down-to-earth analysis of the complex issues combined with his witty insights, make this book impossible to put down and a must read for anyone who wants to be literate in this society."
2,"""Oh, gee, I want to write a book, but I can't come up","..Honestly...after ploughing through this travesty of a book, the above is the only rationale I could imagine for its creation. I was really disappointed because I greatly enjoyed Ms. Shinn's Angel trilogy, and I was looking for more books by her to read. But ""Jenna Starborn""...as a long-time Bronte fancier as well, the kindest thing I can say about Shinn's book is that it just doesn't work on any level."
2,aggravating,"I haven't read Jane Eyre, so I can't review this book from that point of view, although a few of my friends told me that this book follows the plot pretty closely. I can say that I found the two main characters, Jenna and Everett, to be fairly aggravating. Jenna is smart as far as math and science go, but she's an idiot when it comes to people. Even though she likes her job and Everett's ward, she makes hardly any argument when Everett talks about her giving all that up once they're married. I don't understand it. And I can't help but dislike Everett for the way he acts through a great deal of the book. I think the author crippled herself trying to follow Jane Eyre, because I know she can do a better job than this."
3,Disappointing,"I like most of Sharon Shinn's work and I loved Jane Eyre, so why didn't I like this book? It was faithful to Jane Eyre, but I never found her Jane a very compelling character and it just never really made anything special or different. It's an interesting transposition of world for the story, but doesn't have much else to recommend it. Stick to the original if you want the story, or read Shinn's other books for better characters."
3,A pleasant surprise,"I was prepared not to like this book. I have often wanted to rewrite someone else's book and add a few things that appealed to me. That is what I expected to get in Jenna Starborn, a retelling of an old classic in the future. Actually, that is what I got, but the retelling was delightful. I actually enjoyed it. However, the book is not without flaws. This is much more a romance novel than science-fiction. We are given little information about Jenna's universe. Time seems inconsistent, as well as travel, banking, and communication. As a sci-fi fan, I had to put aside my questions and concentrate on the story of Jenna herself. It was a good solid read, a love story with no racy, titilating moments. Jenna and Everett have a deep, somewhat religious, respect for one another. That, in itself, is refreshing."
3,Jenna Starborn: Not All That,"Set in a galaxy far, far away, Jenna Starborn is born--sorta. Jenna--the main character--was grown in a tank and grows up to be a mechanic. This book is supposed to be a rewritten tale of the epic Jane Eyre, but it is far from epic. While Sharon Shinn is a good writer, she looses the essence of Jane--the Gothic artist who falls in love with a depraved man. Jenna instead becomes the technical technician who falls in love with a selfish and aggressive man. That's right, Shinn didn't just mess with Jane, she messed with Mr. Rochester too. Overall, if you loved the original Jane Eyre, don't read this book. However, if you only just liked Jane Eyre you could probably give this book a try and like it decently enough. It is well written with lots of descriptions and an interesting take on Jane Eyre."
2,"Not bad, but pointless.","I've enjoyed many books that were retellings of earlier books. Sometimes I even like the retelling better (Susan Kay's ""Phantom"" springs to mind). Not this time. All this book accomplished was to make me want to read ""Jane Eyre"" again. Basically, it's too close to the original; She has nothing new to say about it. Even the language is the same, which is a bad thing because it sounds stilted. Still, it wasn't too bad. I did read the whole thing. I just don't know why she bothered writing it."
2,Not a sci-fi!,"This book is a romance with slight sci-fi overtones. It's predictable with only a very few unexpected turns. The dialog is dry and unbelievable. Some of the sci-fi ideas are fun but unless you are looking for a run of the mill romance I would not recommend it. Try Sheri Tepper's ""The Gate To Women's Country or ""Six Moon Dance"" or ""The Fresco""."
3,Not a Keeper,"I have loved previous Sharon Shinn novels. When I saw that she had a new novel, I bought it immediately. But I would advise readers who love Sharon Shinn to borrow this book. ""Jenna Starborn"" was a good summer read - It is basicly a rehashing of ""Jane Eyre"" in a futuristic setting. I disagree with the reviewer who forecasts it as being a cult classic in the future. It certainly isn't something I would re-read."
2,Not Her Best Work,"In a nutshell, this is not Sharon Shinn's best work. I found Jenna Starborn to be shallow, formulaic and predictable. It is never advisable to follow the style of another author, unless you can do it better than they can. By all means, range out into space and explore new worlds. Leave Jane Eyre on Earth where she belongs."
3,"a 3.5 star, enjoyable read, even if the plot is familiar","I love Sharon Shinn's books. She creates believable worlds and universes, an I am always dragged into the books immediately.This book was nice, I have read better books than this one. I would have given this book four stars, if it had less exclamation points. The male mc speaks only in them, it seems, and I therefor started to dislike him.The cover of the book says it is a remake of Jane Eyre, scifi style, and I found many aspects in the storyline that were familiar. It still was an enjoyable read on its own, as it was so radically different from the setting of Jane Eyre."
2,Read the original!,"Drippy dialogue and no depth to the main male character make this book a real disappointment to Sharon Shinn fans. I love the Archangel trilogy but found this to be very silly. If you like a real romance with characters you can care about, read the original Jane Eyre. This book reads like an early writing attempt that should have stayed in the workroom."
4,Great Simpson's book.,"If you love the Simpsons and love Halloween, this book is for you! It contains fuuny stories in the style you've come to expect form the Simpsons. I would also recomend Bart Simpson's Hebbie Jeepie Hullabalo."

1,Inappropriate Reading Material for Children,"After reading the children's book ""Ten Little Rabbits"" I was completely appalled by how this book portrayed Native Americans. The fact that they chose rabbits to represent Native American children, is racist in itself, Native Americans are people not animals. The book lumps ten different tribes into one. If a child picked up the book ""Ten Little Rabbits"" they would never know that there were different tribes portrayed. This book could be used as a learning experience for children teaching them about how they can be critical readers. In order to do this it would be necessary to point out and discuss possible misconceptions and stereotypes that one could develop through reading this book. From a concerned Graduate Student in Early Childhood Education."
5,Fun to read for parents and kids alike!,"We loved this book so much, we bought it in both hard cover and paperback formats. It's a great book because the illustrations are gorgeous, the story is original, and you can read it in less than five minutes. Plus it has a rhyming canter without being overly babyish or sing-songy. We love reading it to our one-year-old, but would also be great for young readers as there is not a lot of text and the words are easy. There is also a subtle Native American theme that would lend itself well as a teaching tool."
5,Ten Little Rabbits,This was OUR bedtime book for both of my boys when they were very little. We knew it by heart and could chant the text at times of stress to calm them down. WE/I love this book. Just read it again to my 8 year old and am going to buy it for my 2 month old nephew!
3,This is really cute!,"When I first opened my item, I thought, ""It's so small!"". My next thought was, ""Oh my, I hope it's not too immature for my 4 year old grandson, who can read already."". But, it was cute and he just may enjoy it. I have yet to see him, but when he does come down, I will ask him and, knowing Nicholas, he will give me a honest review from his standpoint. After all, he is honest, he is the one who, living far from me and not seeing me often has told me, ""When I was little, I was afraid of you and did not like you, but now Nana, I love you."" I love his honesty and respect his opinions. We shall see what Nicholas says!"
2,O.K. Book.,"This book is O.K. There are better books out there and Patricia Telesco's book ""Spinning Spells, Weaving Wonders..."" is one of them. This is book is compact, but really doesn't possess enough information for the price."
1,"Not fast, there are better books if you want fast","The author claims this book is a quick reference to find spell ingredients fast. It is not. It is filed by ingredient, not by need. If I were looking for a money spell, or a love spell, I would want a reference that is filed by NEED. You would look up money, or love, and there would be your ingredients. With this book, you have to sort through and read all the definitions to find the right stuff. I recommend the book ""Spinning Spells and Weaving Wonders"" by Patricia Telesco. Its information is filed by need. ""The Pocket Spell Creator"" is useless if you want ""fast."""
5,Simply Charming!,"I loved this charming book! A great reference guide, I keep it right on my altar and it doesn't take up much room or look out of place. Never before have I found a book so helpful. I'm glad to have all the basics in spot together! Thanks so much for writing this book!"
5,It's about time,This is an easy to use reference book that should have been written years ago. It's perfect for anyone - espeically those who want to write their own spells and rituals instead of buying a book of someone else's spells and rituals. This book is great - I plan on using them for Yule gifts this year!
2,Soft musical block,"Thought this block was cute, but it has some faults! I would not have bought it had I been able to test it out personally. It's not very musical, only one nursery rhyme and some sounds. It would easily become boring. Also, to replace the batteries is somewhat difficult."
4,Where's the DVD?,Remember this show from when I was a kid. Enjoying it more now than I thought I would. Wish they would release a season set on DVD so I could watch it on my TV.
4,good old days,as a child like the show and as a man still like it had a disent plot brings back the good old days and ok effects but would like to see the dvd or at least let buyer chouse format so thay may watch it on dvd players and portible dvices so may enjoy it over and over and would start a 70s tv collection then show it to my family and shere storys of the days that the show aired
5,Cheesy but fun!,"This was clearly meant for the demographic I was in when it ran in 1977-1978 (7-11 years old), but it is a lot of fun!"
2,"Cheeseball, and not in the good way","I liked the film version of ""Logan's Run"" (starring Michael York and Jenny Agutter) a lot. The TV incarnation, regrettably, hasn't aged well. The special effects are laughable (laser beams look as if they were drawn on with a red magic marker); the sets and props are a joke (one vehicle has a door obviously made of a sliding panel of plywood); and the acting is, for the most part, just plain bad (Heather Menzies, as Jessica, acts mainly by letting her mouth hang open, catching flies).Unless you're a die-hard fan, or you like to watch cheesy sci-fi and riff on it (which is what we ended up doing), this is not worth spending your money on."
3,A blast from the past,"I have fond memories of my childhood running around playing at Logan's Run. While I was too young to have seen the movie, I was 8 when this series aired and it captivated me. I loved all the Sci-Fi series of the 70's. I also was a sucker for Space:1999 and then later the original Battlestar Galactica. But the real prize of the genre was Buck Rogers (admiteddly because I had a huge crush on Erin Grey...who didn't?).This series carries forth all the original design elements from the movie and combines them with some good writing and pretty good acting. I do think the series lacks some of the biting social commentary that makes the movie great, it is all toned down and sterilised for TV. All in all the effects are typical of the times, but they do their best with what they have. Back then you had to have a suspension of disbelief to enjoy sci-fi.I was glad to see the series available for streaming so I could enjoy it again."
2,Eh....,"this book was just o-kay. i read dead above ground some time ago so when raeding this sequel, the family's story was not as fresh in my mind as it could have been. i reccommend that if this book is read that one should read both books shortly afterwards each other."
3,Good But Not What I Expected,"The case does a good job of protecting the iPod from being damaged. I've had it for about a month and have no complaints in that respect.But there are some negatives to this product:- The case does not allow my car adapter input (not an Apple product) to fit into my iPod.- From the pictures, I expected a textured case. It's not. Overall, it's not as good-looking as the pictures make it out to be.- It's expensive.Also, I was turned off by the packaging. That may be overkill but the packaging looked as though this product gets sold on the street corners of NYC. (For example, the packaging says it's for an iPod Mini as opposed to a Nano.)Overall it's an adequate product but for the price, I expected more. Next time, I'd try buying a case made by Apple."
3,Another generic platform game,"Am I the only one sick of these character 2 dimensional platform games? Just because Majesco (the publisher of the game, who has published other mediocore games such as Ultimate Paintball) slaped a M&M's liscesne on this game doesn't mean that the game is great. This game is as plain as you can get with get from point A to point B gameplay with average graphics. It's tedious and boring as well. If you want a good platform game get Mario Brothers Deluxe or the excellent Rayaman game."
5,AWESOME,"If you like M&M's, this is the game for you! It is so much fun. I know that I had alot of fun with this game and so would you!"
4,Very enjoyable.,I really enjoyed the book. I had heard that there were a lot of Coast Guard manned ships in the war zone of WWII but had not read any books on the subject. I served on this ship in the 1970's and did not know of her war exploits.
2,Cheap Crap,"It's a good thing pasta is soft, because this tong is so thin and bendable that I don't expect it to last too long."
2,Extremely Light-weight,"These tongs are very flimsy. Extremely thin metal. I would not recommend these unless you were dealing with very small quantities of angel hair pasta. The ""teeth"" are flat, as opposed to curved inward to grasp the pasta -- even though the graphic appears to be curved. Therefore the pasta would just slip off the teeth. This is DEFINITELY NOT commercial quality."
4,Variety of Good Marketing Ideas,"I just opened a business and this is the third book I've bought on how to market my business. The other two had a few good ideas, but nothing like this one. This book has a wide range of ideas on how to market your business and some of them you can even make money while you're doing it. I'm recommending this book to a couple of friend who are going into business together after the first of the year."
4,Factory or Fiction?,"If _Seventeen Seconds_ or _Movement_ are treasured members of your record library, this album was crafted for you. With the best moments of Factory and Fiction in mind, Mark Robinson (formerly Unrest) has created a slice of 80's retro rock that's all bass and drums and stopstart breaks. Yes, the back cover is that luminescent silver-gray for a reason. You'll be pulling out your old vinyl for drum track comparisons."
4,Dusted this off and it still sounds as good now as it did then,"A classic. When this came out, I couldn't stop listening to it for months.I just put it back in today to see if it could get me to dance around like it did back then - yep. Fab."
2,Disappointing,"After thoroughly enjoying the first two books of this series, I eagerly grabbed Summer off the shelf and settled in for an entertaining read. But Nick and Octavia never came alive like the Madison men and Harte women of the previous books. JAK continues her wonderful cast of secondary characters, human and non (especially Winston who she portrays so strikingly in just a few sentences that he becomes a major figure). However, even the two family patriarchs lost some of the punch of the earlier books. Did JAK lose interest in this group? After foreshadowing the main characters in the earlier stories, did she find they didn't work out as planned? Count me in as a devoted reader, however....although I may check out a few pages more carefully next time before making a purchase. Summer ended up in the library/charity shop pile."
3,Some good moments,"I like Jayne Ann Krenz. I have always enjoyed her characters, humor and plot lines. There is a formula, but until recently I still loved the books. The last couple however have seemed stale. There are still good moments, but the characters don't seem as fresh and the situations are repetitive. It's still an entertaining, but I don't think the quality is the same as the earlier books."
2,My first -- and last -- Krentz novel,"With the flurry of publicity and television ads for this book, I assumed I'd been missing something. Bought the book. I literally fell asleep a dozen times in the first 70 pages. Ho hum! To be fair, the only romance writers I like much are Danielle Steel, who injects so much emotion into her pages you just overlook her mediocre writing style, and Barbara Taylor Bradford, whose characters are all larger than life and extraordinarily brave and intelligent. By comparison, Summer in Eclipse Bay seemed tepid at best, with characters I could not care about and situations that.....zzzzzzzzzz"
3,where is the sex.,"I did not read the book. So I do not know if they cut it out ofthe audio tape. I don't know about you, but I enjoy sex. Her books need some spice. I have read her books for to many yearsto remember, and a great fan for all of them."
2,Just so-so.,"I think I've burnt out on Jayne Ann Krentz. The chemistry between her main character never sizzles, it just slow simmers. And I'm so tired of her cliched characters: the cold, uptight, calculating, corporate male hero and the emotional/spiritual, free spirit heroine. Tired, tired, tired. On top of that, the plots are boring. I give up on this author."
2,A Repeat of the First 2 Books in the Series,"All 3 books in this series are so similarly written I almost felt as if I was reading the same story 3 times. I thought the first book (Eclipse Bay) was absolutely fabulous, but don't bother reading the other two. Switch some names around and throw in a kid and you'll have the same book all over again. I thought the author could have been a little more creative in the differences between the stories."
4,Very Good,I enjoy reading books that are several books with the same characters. I like this author because she writes about current times.
4,great value,"The only thing that really bugs me is the huge 'Phaidon' logo on the front, almost as big as the title. But there are like 300 pages of his word pieces, and they're all really funny and awesome."
5,Awesome shoes!,These shoes are so comfortable - I can wear them all day and never think about my feet! I already own two other pairs of them. Can't say enough about their comfort.
1,Not So Hot Pot,"All one has to do is have coffee made by a coffee press once to see how superior the brew made by this method is compared to any brewing method using a filter. I wanted a ceramic coffee press because my glass one chipped at the spout and I thought ceramic would be sturdier. However, the plunger does not fit the inside of the press well enough to keep the grounds from getting into the coffee. I even tried the plunger from my glass press and had no better luck. So I am back to the chipped coffee press and will just have to be careful washing it."
2,A rehash -- the original was better,"Largely an unfortunate rehashing of material from Asimov's previous autobiographical works, with short excerpts from some of his letters thrown in. I'm a pretty big Asimov fan (I think I've read at least a hundred of his books), but I was disappointed with my purchase.Folks interested in Asimov's life would do much better to try the 1994 autobiography ""I. Asimov,"" which was released posthumously. The book is still in print, in paperback form. It's a comprehensive and reasonably interesting look at his life, broken into short thematic segments.Hard core fans looking for something beyond ""I. Asimov"" may want to try Asimov's first two volumes of autobiography -- ""In Memory Yet Green"" covers the years 1920-1954, and ""In Joy Still Felt"" covers 1954-1978. Both titles are out of print, but are easily available from online sources like BookFinder.com."
4,"Very good, Janet compliments Asimov's story","I enjoyed reading it. Asimov's writing-style combined with Janet's clarifications and additions, make it a very interesting book. The end is sad but dignified, no doubt as Janet intended. Very good."
1,I was dissappointed.,"I have read Asimov's earlier biography, I. ASMOV, and rather enjoyed that as a funny look into one of science fiction's most respected writers. This book trashes that down to a few measly pages, and ruins Asimov's clear, flowing style. After reading one book with this information already, I felt cheated."
5,"It's been a good read, too!","This book is a must read for anyone who is a ""fan"" of the late, great Isaac Asimov, who was perhaps the most prolific writer who ever lived and who was truly a ""Man for All Seasons."" But even those who have never read Asimov or have never heard of him would benefit from being exposed to the thoughts of this icon of reason. It is humorous, moving, inspirational and informative, and is a fitting tribute to a person who was truly one of the great intellects of all time. It was not for nothing that he was dubbed ""A Natural Resource."""
3,"great case, cheap film and cheap disposable camera","I bought this for a cruise. Took it on the beach with water sports and snorkling. Took the advise of a review that said to not use the film that comes with the camera because it is cheap. Replaced it with Fuji film and it worked great. However, on the 3rd roll of film the camera broke, crank arm would not wind the film to load it. Scrapped the camera that came with it and just bought another one that fits the case. So bottom line, great waterproof case, pre-loaded with cheap film and an even cheaper disposable camera. Can't really say that was a negative review because if you think about it, disposable cameras aren't designed to last more than a few uses anyway."
1,Seals failed on first time out,"Didn't last through a full roll of film. Which means that everything that we took earlier in the day was ruined as well.Used to take disposable waterproof cameras on float trips, drop off at a one-hour place the next morning and have prints for everyone before we went our separate ways at lunch. Thought this would be a good, cheap alternative (didn't want to lose a digital camera if the canoe tipped). Unfortunately, this didn't meet our needs. The seal failed without diving, just splashing around in the river."
1,worst sea camera I have had,"I bought a SS1100 underwater camera because I thought it was a good camera for a fair price. But on my first dive with the camera it flooded and I couldn't take any picture, it was a pity because I saw a huge turttle and it would be a great picture. It is a pity but I recomend not to buy any camera of this type. I was used to a Sea&Sea underwater camera (not digital) much bigger and I was hoping to have a smaller one but I was deceived."
1,Waste of money!!!,"Bought this camera on Amazon to take on an Alaskan cruise where we were going to do some white water rafting. Obviously did not want to take the Nikon! I removed the roll of film that was preloaded as many reviews talked about poor quality of enclosed film. Loaded a fresh roll of Fuji 800. Followed instructions on loading exactly. You have to move all of the film from the canister to the camera and as you shoot, it draws it back into canister. Loaded film, closed back. Started to crank the film into the camera, and the crank BROKE OFF! Tried to roll the film into the camera with a pen point used as a crank. Didn't work. Threw the entire camera away! Never got 1 picture. A total waste of $16! Don't waste your money!"
1,Very disappointed.,"I went through 5 rolls of film trying to get this camera to work. We have regular film cameras, so it's not that we don't know how to use camera with film. This camera just was not working. It was such a disappointment since we bought it for a trip to Miami and it didn't work. We could get it set up and started, but then after taking the first picture and winding to the next one, the camera would roll the film back into itself like when done with the roll and rewinding it. Such a waste of money. Luckily we also brought a Fuji disposable waterproof camera and that worked just fine."
2,only good if you're in crystal clear water,"We used this camera to swim with the manatees and we ended up trashing most of the pictures. Because we weren't in super super clear water like in Hawaii, the pictures didn't turn out that great even though there's a flash. The water was clear enough where I thought the pictures would turn out better since we used a disposable camera without flash the last time we were in Crystal Rive, FL. We were very disappointed since all the reviews were really good for this camera."
2,"Not all that easy to use, picture quality isnt very impressive","1. First of all, everything about the camera is manual. Loading the film, remembering to rewind before opening the rear of the camera etc. It took me a while to figure it out. And by the way, I did expose one roll that had my diving pictures. Since it happened in dimly lit room, I still got some pictures.2. Having a flash was a plus but isnt a huge improvement. The pictures come good only in very short range. It defeats the whole purpose of wanting to take pictures when you go diving or snorkelling. It didnt capture the colors or the detail.Overall it wasnt much of an improvement over a disposable camera."
1,"Fussy, Fussy, Fussy!","I was excited to find a book filled with fun, fresh summer ideas but one look inside and I was so disappointed. The premise of the book is fresh, easy meals that appeal in those lazy summer days and nights yet the book is filled with not terribly interesting, not terribly difficult but very fussy meals. Who needs that in the summer? and who needs this book -- certainly not me!"
4,A Trail Lasting a Decade,"This is a bridge that has seen plenty traffic, as the release is a compilation of 12 tracks from eight albums issued during 1988-1998.Mothers of Rain and Sungate are majestic classics of the ""New Age"" era for the band. It is an excellent sampler for new fans who may not want to dive into TD's vast catalog of for those who are looking to supplement their collection of releases - studio and live - from this time period."
5,Looks like they've done it again,"I loved soundtrack to a headrush, and emanuel is the best band to see live. The last time i saw them, they played a bunch of their new songs before the cd came out, and took the time to personally introduce themselves to me and chat with me about how sweet the new cd is, etc. So when I finally got my hands on it after it came out, I was blown away. Finally a band that can make a second album without messing it up. They didn't lose their edge or attitude, but they still managed to create a different experience. The aggressiveness and screaming is all used appropriately, and tastefully, which I can definitely appreciate. This band is dedicated to making good music, and they treat their fans so well. They just mailed me a poster and a bunch of ""Black Earth Tiger"" post cards, which was super nice of them. Emanuel rules, listen to this cd."
2,Black,This is a favorite product of mine and I looked forward to receiving it. The lotion was old and cream was not solid. Very disappointed.
3,Check examples please.,"It was missing alot of information in the area of new users and granting privileges. Quotations marks were left out of key commands to grant privileges and there are limits...There were misspellings of words. The book should have gone through spellcheck and a thorough test of examples.I would rate this book lower but I admit, it helped me get started. If I didn't have teaching and other data processing experience I would be bald trying to follow this book."
4,Great starter book on MySql,This is the best starter book on MySql that I've read and I've read quite a few. Start with this one.
5,real porcelain,"shipped in one day,wow. easy install,only 2 screws to connect the wires,lets hope the pull chain holds up,thats what broke on my other one,it pulled out of switch."
1,Arrived broken,This is probably something that shouldn't be sent through the mail. It doesn't say in the description that it is porcelain and I was expecting a plastic one. It arrived from my mailman in a million pieces
3,"Good, but lacks the epic dimension of Flanagan's run","Running shoes and colts, interesting cocktail, but definitely not up to Flanagan's run. Quickly read, quickly forgotten..."
3,Lower quality than what is sold in stores,I have purchasing Seventh Generation 2 ply for years from local grocery store. I was saving about .20 cents per roll by ordering online. The product I received was not the same quality or feel compared to the product I bought at the store. We seem to be going through more toliet paper. Not sure if it is worth buying online. Will update again.
5,Most importat thing,"If you are not familiar with DIR concepts, I would recommend to read first ""Engaging Autism"". Anyway, it is the most helpful tool to engage not only autistic children but also the ones who are at risk. My two-year daughter is at risk and she is showing very good improvement. I strongly recommend it."
1,To Small,"The hackey sac quality is good, but it is to small. I like fat ones. This one is not even on the medium size. It's very small."
3,Fun Shoes,"The shoes are great, but it is confusing that it says ""gold"" but shows the purple ones. But the shoes are great, anyway. I do have the gold ones."
1,Disappointment,"Doesn't show any hidden items, doesn't have charts showing the percentages that pokemon will show up in certain area, doesn't have anything. In fact, sometimes it will outright skip some pokemon in areas altogether, even in the text. Simply not useful. If you really want some maps, it's good for that, but you can get that for free at bulbapedia or gamefaqs, along with percentages and info on all the hidden items (which are about the only things that you shouldn't be able to figure out on your own). I don't recommend this."
2,Nuttin butta.,"This guide ain't so good afta all. I tot it wood be good, but it bugged the wrecktower! What a Snotedex it has!"
3,My Official Review of the Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen Version Player's Guide,"There is a lot of great information, however, I gave it only 3 stars instead of more stars because the pages fall out easily. My mom had to get a three-hole puncher and put it into a binder folder instead."
2,"Good, but $15?","There's a great deal of useful information in this book. I wound up feeling ripped off in the end though because there are MANY very important secrets that are not revealed in here. You can find more from online walkthrus than you can from buying this book at times, and for the money, well that's just not right. My combined cost for both items is such that I ended up feeling like I have to live in New York to get the complete game with yet another pokemon I can't get unless team Nintendo graces my city with its presence. I also have to be available that one day, if it ever comes again. Much about being a Pokemon fan is fun, but there is alot of tedium as well. Buy it if you like the visual aids as the maps are pretty good. The Pokedex has nice detail as well."
1,"Zero stars, that does it!","STUPID. This has so many mistakes. There is no such thing as Cinnabar. It's Cinnamonbar. You called ""Iland"" ""Island!"" It is stupid to make such a horrible guide. The cover is stupid, the information inside is stupid, and even the people who say 5 stars or four-and-a-half stars are total IDIOTS!The author rushed and didn't care what he wrote. This guide stinks! It has every mistake I cold imagine! I recomend the Prima! That guide has everythink! This guide does not have a complete Snotedex. The Prima has a Pokedex. Prima rocks!'Tendo is the worst guide. Don't buy this, you nag!"
1,Missed Opportunity,"Have to agree with J. Pauley's assessment. Amazon's description is misleading about some of the titles only being available on CD through this box set. Aside from the few bonus tracks, the only thing noteworthy in this collection is that ""When Lights Are Low"" is finally available on CD. Maybe we'll have to wait for Tony's 90th before some of his other albums from that period see the light of day."
3,hubby's wish list,"Sure do wish that ""I"" had read the reviews before ordering for my husband as a holiday gift.Perhaps I should have stayed with the ""Duets"" CD only.Will post ""his"" comments after the holidays."
4,The puzzle game that is what fun was made for,OK i have played many puzzle games and i must tell you spin jam is by far a really great game. It is done by a united kingdom programming company call empire interactive.now The idea is to match the balls and score points .Failing to do so will make the balls return forcing you to pop and spin at a in creasing speed.The charaters are wonderful and it makes the best two player game since bust a move 4.I was quite suprised by this title and i recommend this for the fall or during winter months ahead.Price wise this is a deal... Buy this game at all costs but if your not into puzzle games steer clear and go for something that fills your needs.
3,How to Make a Geodesic Sphere from Paper,"Ever wonder how to make a a model of a geodesic dome? This is a book for recreational math enthusiasts and Buck-Minster-fuller-philes, the most hands-on introduction to geodesic geometry out there. Just page after page of sphere models, nothing else. It's a nice companion to Wenninger's classic, ""Polyhedral Models,"" but possibly is a little redundant."
4,Almost perfect,"The book arrived in almost pristine condition, but there was one annoying problem with it. Two of the pages were stuck together, and I ended up tearing one of the pages getting them unstuck. The book is usable, and I'm enjoying it. I just wish that I hadn't had to tear a page in it to use it."
4,Pleased,"As with other used CDs I've purchased on amazon.com ... I was very pleased.. the rating of ""very good"" was correct. No scratches and, I guess because it was a demo CD, there was even a bonus track I hadn't heard before..I've purchased more CDs on amazon since.. and will continue to do so in the future...GriFF"
1,"Trudy, madly dreadful","A very disappointing film and, having watched it, find the praise of the other reviewers unbelievable. Campbell is attractive enough to watch but that is about it. The acting is wooden across the board, the character development is woeful and none of the individuals seems more than one dimensional. Finally who wrote the script? So full of holes in terms of logic and believability that you could drive a coach and horses through it. Cheaply made, cheaply written and an embarrassment to have been in it - and perhaps to have watched it too."
2,RITES OF PASSAGE,"RITES OF PASSAGE STARING JASON BEHR OF THE TV SHOW ROSWELL IS ONE VERY DISAPOINTING FILM, FEEL SORRY FOR JASON BEHR HES CAREER IS STALLED HE HAS SO MUCH PROMISE, THE STORY IS ONE HARD TALE AND NOT WORTH THE COST OF THE DVD JASON PLAYS A GAY YOUTH TAKEN ADVANAGE OF BY ESCAPE PRISONERS, IT ONE SAD TALE."
2,VERY weird thriller...,"And not because it involves a gay love story!Jason Behr plays Campbell,a boy disowned by his lawyer father (Dean Stockwell)when he's caught in the act with another man.There are numerous flashbacks--which would have been powerful if the script were stronger.Escaped convicts,hidden $$$,and so on get tangled into the plot.Campbell,his father&estranged; brother get taken hostage--and just when you think it'll get suspenseful,it ends up getting VERY VERY VERY talky.It seems the screenwriter wasn't sure if this was going to be a thriller or a ""coming out"" movie.It makes for weird,kinda boring,early morning viewing..."
4,Impressive story-telling,"This film somehow managed to escape my attention until now. I rented it with modest expectations, but I was glued to the screen.Perhaps there are some imperfections in this little gem, but the minor flaws are far outweighed by a great cast, fast pacing, you'll-never-guess-what-happens-next story telling, and drama in spades.Now drama can get old fast, but this film works. If you're uncomfortable with gay sub-plots, this film probably isn't for you; there are several, and they're key to the story. But If you're okay with coming-out issues, struggles between sons and sons and fathers, and a considerable amount of bloodshed, I'd check this out.There's enough drama, conflict, deception, plot twists, secrets, and baggage here to fill a week of soap operas, but it's served up here sensitively and with some meaning. Highly recommended. Check it out."
5,powerful story,"How wrong parents are who are blinded by the ""Light"" to force all their children into the same ""box"" whether the child fits or not."
3,"Stagey, Cliche Ridden, Well Acted","Were it not for the gay angle, this film could be called a compendium of escaped convict movie cliches. If the Jason Behr character had been a woman rather than a gay man, there would be little to distinguish this plot from literally dozens of films of the 1950s and early 1960s.Limited almost entirely to a single set, the interior of a vacation cabin in the woods, the script seems more for a stage play than a film.Jason Behr is very appealing as an unappealing character whose life seems marked by poor judgment and bad decisions. The supporting cast is generally first rate.Director Victor Salva knows how to generate suspense and how to keep things moving, but this one doesn't pass much beyond 'Made for TV' quality."
4,finally !,i added this movie on my wishlist back in 04 cuz it looked interesting and i finally saw it today !i actually bought it first then saw it for the 1st time . all i can say is im happy with it in the end . im glad the gay characters in this film were not stereotypes .
2,Not a complete waste of time,"The acting in this film ranges from better than average to pretty damn good. The script, however, has holes that you can drive a truck through, and the plot is silly bordering on the inane. There is no new territory here at all and the territory that is opened has been been covered better by other gay and non-gay themed films. I felt like I was being fed a Twinkie and told that it was roasted duck (an old Hollywood trick that is now increasingly present in ""independent"" films)."
3,"Beware of the Digiview edition of ""Rites of Passage""","This is a fine film however, the Digiview Entertainment DVD edition is the version that has been edited for broadcast television. Full screen with the profanity blanked out. I'm not very disappointed since I only paid a $1 for this DVD at Walmart. The story of the film is very engaging but, feels very closterphobic like a filmed stage play. All in all not a bad deal considering what you usually find in the dollar DVD bin. Good quality picture (compared to other bargain DVDs) just not the version of ""Rites of Passage"" available on other DVD editions. If you're a fan of the film and want to own it on DVD this is not the edition to purchase."
5,EXCELLENT,"I really liked this movie man to a point that I even cried. I think all of them, from Jason to Dean to James....all of them did a great job for this film. Its very rare that a man will accept his mistakes and apologize for it. I would recommend it to anyone"
2,Not very good---just kind of there,"I dunno - call me a cynic, but does every film about gay people just automatically get considered ""a great film""?? In the case of Rite of Passage, I tend to wonder if viewers are just soooo starved for gay subject matter that anything will pass.The movies isn't horrible - it's just not great. It moves rather slow, the product value is fair at best, and the plot is rather uninteresting. There is the requisit gay son/hard nosed father theme, the hopeless romantic theme, the accepting brother, etc. They all are there---but the problem is, most viewers will just say ""who cares"".I found that no matter how much I wanted to love htis movie, it was just something to watch on a Saturday night. Don't get your hopes up. If you are looking for your next meaning of life gay film--this one probably isn't it. If you collect every video or DVD where there is a gay plot--well, I guess here's another one for your collection."
5,The Almighty Sequoia...Glowing!!!,"...A piece on the earth...Sherwood's music identifies itself as the geometric chaos.. So fractal.. So continues... The tracks are arranged in a circular way so that it keeps looping forever as far as your whirling sound system accepts digital muses!Praising the CD will definitely make it sound as a commercial piece of art while its in reality a work of maturity and innovation regarding the techniques and the musical philosophy involved ...Becoming a Cliché is standing alone surrounded with many other Dub dreams...I can say that the feelings which are ""secreted""! while listening are the same as the light reflected inside a falling water drop.. Towards a running blue...blue...river.....Enjoy sailing..."
3,War Years with JEB Stuart,"Blackford started out as one of General Stuart's staff and then was detailed to the ANV Engineer Corps. He's acerbic, opinionated and occasionally thick-headed (as when he fails to notice, during the retreat to Appomattox, that anything is wrong). He gives a good description of the Battle of First Manassas and accounts of several other battles and campaigns, including Gettysburg. Although Blackford is justly best known as a Stuart chronicler, the most unique information given in the memoir is the description of how the Engineer Corps built the trenches at Petersburg. Blackford's endearing descriptions of his horses add a human touch."
3,Alright for kids,"My son loved the product on site, but I had some issues. The directions were not clear on how to get started using the controller and the writing is really small. Also, make sure you get plenty of batteries, we've used several batteries and we are only on day two."
2,Cannot recommend,"Perhaps this workbook is somewhat effective when used in a class, less so on one's own. Pattison's writing here is weak and frequently unclear, as if he did tossed this one off too quickly. Worse, the song examples he uses are far too often poor quality lyric writing themselves. Count the imperfect rhymes alone!Too poorly written for the novice to follow, too frustrating for the experienced lyricist, and way too encouraging of mediocrity by example. Try Pattison's other books instead."
2,mind of a man,it is the best process to know about the mind of a person by his/her own hand writing.
2,Sad AI / Buy A Game Cube Version,"I bought this long ago on PlayStation 1 when this version first came out. It was released as a budget title ($20 new on first day of release), and was delayed a few times right before its release, probably over a few quality issues. The AI was just plain terrible from what I remember. I spent too much time watching the computer AI hide from each other while I sat and waited time to run out if I had already died. For the same price or cheaper, just get Bomberman Generations for the Game Cube (get a Game Cube since they are so cheap now) which has very good multi-player, good AI, lots of differnet levels, more fun items (dangerout bomb -- like a little atomic bomb)."
4,Smells great!,Smell is close to that of Mellon as stated. I use it every day now. This is great as well
2,It's Ok But I Don't Smell Any Melon In This..,I got this product when I got the Cotton Candy Fantasy 8 oz Body Spray (Fantastic item!! I HIGHLY recommend it!!) I am a person who really enjoys 'melony' smells but I don't smell any melon in this at all... It really disappointed me. I still like it but I really wish there was some melon in it...
4,Woah!!,"The wind blew gentally carresing Globals brown hair that cascaded down over his broad shoulders. My description of the opening scene where Captain Global stands at the top of a pleatu looking out over the war torn earth. Well anyways to keep it short this videos great! The animations good the script was well written. The only bad thing is on the last episode a still life of fruit is shown for 4 minutes, i guess to fill up time. But anyways this is a great tape. Whether your a new commer to the series or a veteran this tape will sit tall and mighty on your shelf."
3,Couldn't hear it,"I was disappointed. Shakti Gawain is good, I could hear her just fine. The male narrator is drowned out by music, however, and I just couldn't make out what he was saying."
4,prescription medicine,"excellent legal tale with a timely theme at its center: how drugs are brought to market. a foreign takeover of a small pharmaceutical company offers insights into the origin and importance of trademarks and the fda approval process. smooth, confident narrative tone and engaging characters."
1,Worse than worthless,"At best this book may help somebody transition from a previous version of FrontPage to the current (2002) version. But for somebody who has never before used FrontPage (any version), this book is NOT a teaching tool.Be skeptical of glowing 5-star reviews from critics who find absolutely no fault with the books they are reviewing. ""Before reading xxxx I knew absolutely nothing but after devouring this paragon of perfection I am now totally conversant with the subject of yyyy."""
5,Plainly & Simply a great Reference,"I'm teaching a workshop of beginners Front Page and searched to find a book for participants. This book is it. It is clearly illustrated with direct instruction about procedures, and the low cost is an exceptional value. I love the book's easy to understand format. It is a valuable addition to my personal program reference library."
2,Plain & Simple ??,"I judge books of this type by how much progress I can make in the first 2 hrs... and with Plain & Simple I had achieved nothing in this time.The content is all there, but badly disjointed.Frankly, I became so bored with the book, I reverted back to 2002's online help and found a much more useful tutorial to get me started... only then did Plain & Simple make any real sense, when I wanted to perform some specific tasks."
2,"OK, but out dated","This is a reasonable album guide that covers the basics, but little else.The main problem is that at nearly 7 years of age, this is in sore need of an update."
2,Too judgmental on too many artists,"Besides Rolling Stone guide, I've read two other album review guides and I found this one seemingly less generous in giving out good ratings to various artists. Too many artists and albums in this book were given poor ratings- the critics saying that so is so is worthless even though another album guide would rate them as being fairly decent. If other album guides gave an album a poor rating at least they tried to be more objective about it and give a good reason why. It seems like here, they are trashing one too many artists just because one critic didn't like so and so even if that artist had made a clear impact in the rock industry."
1,Pretentious racialist trash,"The colonizer here is a Malaysian-born New Yorker pursuing the inscrutable orientalized (Thai) hustler and taking out some of his aggressions on a European (Danish) tourist. Of course, the unnamed narrator considers himself a victim--not how most Malaysians regard families like his."
2,Too many subplots and not enough reflection,"I think the NYT Book Review summarized it best... ""too diffused and stylized to provide a deeper reflection."" It's a pity that the writer succumbed to stylizing his prose because he has a keen eye for observation which is unfortunately lost in trying to be too cute."
3,Aqua Rocker Doesn't Rock,"Although this inflatable seems well-made and durable, my ten nieces and nephews (ages 10-18, various weights) were unable to get this inflatable to rock for them. The kids tried everything, lighter weight kids paired equally, paired unequally, larger kids, etc.. However, I must say they still seemed to enjoy using it for lounging/playing even though they eventually gave up trying to make it rock back and forth. I just feel it wasn't worth the money because of the disappointment. A much better choice I would recommend for a fun pool activity is the inflatable called Sawmill Splash... LOADS of fun. Hope this was some help."
3,do not over-inflate,"watch out, the aqua rocker can't be inflated as much as you'd inflate one of those cheap, coleman boats for example, so don't even try. Before using it, I pumped it up a little too much and the internal support things started breaking before I could disconnect the pump. Fortunately there was no air leak. Anyway, I only paid twenty for it so it wasn't a big loss. There are definitely more durable inflatable things to play with. We actually ended up losing it on the river since there wasn't anything on it to tie a rope to. It got caught up in some branches and we couldn't make it back. So long, Aqua Rocker."
3,Not really a rocker,"Kids have loved this ""rocker"" but it's more of a float. Doesn't rock. Still has been fun for them to jump and climb on."
1,Poorly made,Does not work as described. Ours popped after the first use as well. Not very happy to have paid $60 for this.
1,Disappointing Remakes,"I should have taken a clue from the picture on the cover. These are NOT the original recordings of Brenda Lee's hits, they are very tired sounding new versions recorded more recently by a significantly different-sounding Brenda Lee. Sound quality is poor. Not at all what I was hoping for."
4,A good read from a promising new author,"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It takes an unexpected turn, and keeps you guessing. far from predictable. I look forward to more from Jim kohl"
3,"Good, But still seeking answers","The previews of the songs don't really speak to the entirety of the CD, It is lacking a bit in cohesiveness from track to track but overall is a good progressive effort."
4,Great game.,"I bought this game the week it came out. I was soo thrilled. There's Master Pabs(From MR2)! There's colt(from MR2)! and... hey! Colt dissapeared! That is what I thought when I first played this game. Don't get me wrong it's a good game. I loved this game, and I think it is one everyone should play. The only thing I didn't like was that the card battles are way too long. Heck, for tournaments, I have spent 3 hours when battling 4 people! But, I think everyone should play it."
4,Shuffling Sweet,"I plaid the Gameboy Advanced version first and so I just had to try the PS1 addition . . . not quite as fun as the other games due to being limited to cards . . . and that you have to constantly search through dozens of packs to get all the needed cards for each monster to make the best deck for each one . . . but as card game spinoffs go, it's not all that bad.A fairly easy 'combat' system, a good background story, sticks to the basis of the original series, an all around 'ok' game."
3,Monster Rancher 2,"When i hread about this game i said this sounds like fun so i said to my mom ""Can u get this for my brithday?"" and she said ok. so i got home and started playing it right away. Well when i started it was kind of fun but than it grow boring and i didn't want to play it as much as when io frist got it. But it is still rather fun to play."
3,Not for the married bridesmaids,"I bought 7 copies of this book to give to my friends when I ask them to be bridesmaids. When they arrived, I found that the whole beginning of it is about being the single bridesmaid left behind when a friend gets married. Since I'm the last of my friends to be married and all my bridesmaids are already hitched, this book just didn't apply. The books are being returned and I'm on the hunt for another ""asking idea."" So, if your bridesmaids are already married, this doesn't make a good gift. Cute, though, if you're younger and one of the first to be married."
1,so mean!!!!,"I recieved this book as a gift from the bide to whom I am the Maid of Honour. As maid of honour, i've already read many bridesmaids how to books and this is by far the worst one ive come across. It not only has no practical information, no how to guide, no words of wisdom whatsoever, what words it does give you are just mean. It tells you that your friend will never care about you as much after shes married, and whats worse is that there is an entire paragraph about how all bridesmaids resent the maid of honour, which is just putting bad ideas into peoples heads. Pass on this book if you want to be of any use to the bride on her wedding day....."
2,Cute but not functional,"I bought this highchair for my daughter's 3rd birthday. I also got her the Chou Chou Doll and thought it would be fun to have a high chair for her. I didn't realize how very small the chair is until after we put it together. The doll I had purchased doesn't really fit in the chair. The tray doesn't come off the chair, only moves out a little, which makes it hard for young ones to get the dolls into the chair. I even had a hard time getting the doll in the chair. The disapering food and spoon is cute and my daughter has had fun with it but we will be returning the chair to the store and try and find something better."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY","This doll highchair was a waste of money. The tray does not come off or slide easily. My daughter was totally frustrated with it. She loves to play ""mommy"" but won't even bother with this toy anymore."
2,Please buy a different highchair,"We bought this highchair for our 18 month old and while she loves the spoon and food bowl, she is constantly frustrated trying to get her doll in or out of the chair. We have only tried to use 12"" dolls or smaller but the tray doesn't slide very far out and their legs just fold beneath them. She is trying so hard to be a little Mommy, even comforting the dolls when she can't get them in or out. Don't put your child through this frustration, buy a different chair."
5,Let's Pretend!,"This colorful pint sized high chair is a favorite in our home. My girls take turns ""feeding"" their ""babies"" the yummy cereal with the spoon and love pretending they're real mommies. The item assembles in no time, the front tray slides for easy placement of your dolls, and there is a little foot rest too. So very cute. The tray comes with a cardboard insert which has pictures of common baby items like sippy cup, the cereal bowl and spoon. Easy to store but keep the spoon and cereal bowl safe since they're small and could easily be misplaced. A definite A+ from this parent -- thanks Fisher Price!"
3,Smaller than it appeares,The high chair is cute and seems pretty sturdy BUT it is much smaller than I thought it would have been. Be sure to check the size in inches!!!!!!
2,APSET WHEN I OPENED THE BOX,"MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER RECEIVED THIS ON CHRISTMAS DAY. SHE RECEIVED HER KITCHEN SET ALSO. I COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL MY HUSBAND COULD PUT HER HIGH CHAIR TOGETHER SO HER BABY COULD SIT IN THE HIGHCHAIR WHILE SHE COOKED. HER LITTLE MOMMY BABY DID NOT FIT, IT WAS EXTREMELY SMALL AND SHE COULD ONLY FIT HER STUFFED ANIMAL IN IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO PUT IN A FEW MORE DOLLARS AND GET A BIGGER ONE THAT WILL LAST A LITTLE LONGER. I DOUBT THIS WILL LAST 6 MONTHS."
3,"This toy was ok, but cost too much","The Little Mommy high chair was an ok toy, its durable enough and my daughter has not broke it yet but it seems smaller than I thought it would be. It seemed shorter than I thought it would be, I thought it would be tall like a real high chair and that my daughter could use it while standing. Its short and low to the ground. I would have been happier if it cost less, if it would have cost less I would have expected the short item I received."
1,find something better,"Sorry that this review is a bit premature, since I suggest looking for a better high chair but I have not yet looked myself. But in short: I agree with other reviewers that it is too frustrating... even for real mommies."
5,Perfect size for small doll and small girl!,"We got this chair to go with a cabbage patch newborn and it is perfect! My two year daughter puts her doll in the chair and carries it everywhere. It was a good investmant because she loves it and it takes up very little room. The chair also gives the doll a ""home"", so my daughter can always put her away when I ask her to."
1,Do I have to give it a star at all?? o_O,"Ugh! Ugh! Horrible! This completely unentertaining mess sounds like what might spill out the open door of a local karaoke bar, and not at all like a professionally produced CD. I'm disturbed to hear Enya's beautiful music so poorly performed. Nothing original here, either. At least the Taliesan Orchestra's Enya tribute tried to do something different and interesting with her music. This is just a lot of very untalented singing that seems to be making an effort at sounding like Enya and failing horribly. What is it about a dreadful knockoff that makes it a tribute? Do yourself a favor and just buy the real thing. Or sing Enya's music in the shower yourself. You couldn't do any worse than this."
1,---BEWARE-- Horrid music about..,"I thought this would be an interesting spin on some great Enya songs. Boy was I wrong! I DIED laughing when I heard this lady sing. Is it me, or does she sing really flat? Someone really hit the nail on the head about it being karaoke-like. Honestly, I think I could have done better with a Speak-N-Spell and a tin can. What were they thinking?This poor lady thought she was doing a great service by giving tribute to the great Enya, but alas, she probably ruined her name forever (Who was she anyway?).I will admit, 12 Girls Band did a fine job doing an instrumental of ""Only Time"". I say IF someone is going to do a tribute, DO NOT SING! No one, I mean NO ONE can have a voice like Enya.Dave from San Antonio, TX"
3,Not quite,"Says it will hold a 17in laptop. It will hold it, but it won't close/zip up when I have my laptop in it. Like the style, like the bag, but I'm disappointed I can't completely close it with the laptop in the laptop padded compartment. It will fit in the unpadded section and zip, but not the padded area."
4,Durable/compact......but,"the shape is too bulky. Item keeps the bulky shape shown regardless of how full it is making the backpack uncomfortable to travel with especially in crowds. It would knock everything/everyone around, over and train rides were clumpsy from beginning to end (I live in NYC). Should have sent it back when I first realized that, so now I have just pushed it aside and shopping around for something else."
5,"Nice tool, well built","Not too much to say about this tool. It worked perfectly for removing the fuel pump module on a 2008 Chevy Suburban 1500. I had to put a considerable amount of torque on the retaining ring and this tool didn't slilp at all. Used once, filed it away in the tool chest satisfied with my purchase but hoping that I never have to use it again."
1,Waste of money! not worth it,"Well I bought this earring because there is additional 20% that day, well I wore it for a day and went to sleep it fell off the bed and my baby got it into her mouth, I was horrified luckily I got it on time before she can swallow it, the backing of this earring is hollow that's why it's easy to lose it, it could fall off while you touch your hair.....I lost the other earring again and nowhere to find...I only had them for mere 1 week, don't buy this earring buy something expensive which you know will last longer, craftmaship is cheap!"
4,Emergency Battery Extender,Somewhat skeptical about this until I used it. Works great for those unexpected times when the internal battery runs down. I would not recommend it for times when you need the GPS though - it drains those AA batts really quick.
3,nicely wrapped but really small,"The presentation of this gift basket is good, very nicely warped and looks good in quality, BUT! it's way too small from what I expected as a Thanksgiving basket. Don't get me wrong, I ordered one last year and it was a lot cheaper than this and a lot bigger too..well, i understand we're all struggling under this economy, but it is TINY to the point that i feel either I was too dumb to spent that much on this size of a basket or maybe I should have paid more, if I knew it was going to be like this, for a bigger one that's more presentable to bring to my friend's house..anyway, a little too late for that..still, thanks, Amazon, the delivery was pretty fast."
3,A possible movie?,"It's a good story and hopefully down the road, it should be made into a movie, now that there's all this technology on special effects and computer stunt doubles, etc."
5,A great book from a great series!,"I've read the whole series twice (exept for #8-Dead Man's Hand, which I am still trying to get). This is one of my favorites, it keeps you guessing, even on the last page! When you think you now who did it, think again, and again! I would recomend any book in the series to any one 13or older. I have to mention some of my other favorites: #4-Hot Pursuit, and #7-Most Wanted. One little piece of advice: Don't buy any of these, books with the *intent* of reading a little, then puting it down, you won't be able to!"
5,Excellent biography of an enigmatic character,"Was Moyse one of the greatest flutists of all time? I don't think so. Although an inspiring and brilliant pedagogue, an essential author of dozens of great studies, comparing his playing to Gaubert or Hennebains is depressing. He just wasn't that great. It's a similar situation with the illustrious William Kincaid, who I feel was overshadowed by his pupils, especially Baker and Mariano.Anyway, McKutcheon does a beautiful job with this biography. It is engrossing and marvelously written. It's up there with Nancy Toff's bio of Barrere. A must read for serious flutists, even if you are as sacrilegious as I am!"
1,The game is a good thought but slow.,"Well, I started by getting the PC game its is real nice. Handling as well as graphics. the playstation game is disappointing to say the least. That's probably why it cost 9.99! don't buy the playstation version of this game, get the PC one of this game it is really worth what you pay."
1,Pong anyone?,"I have no idea how old this game is but it really stinks. I hope it is REALLY old because that would be the only excuse for it. The graphics are really, really horrible. The sound is atrocious. and the physics in the game are laughable."
1,Worst game ever,"Ford racing what can I say about this game, how about it was bad. It was one of the worst games I have ever played, the graphics were slow and blocky, the sound un-intresting and plain and the game-play itself was boring. The worst part was the racing, you start by choosing career mode were you start as a new driver in the ford KA this car is slow, with only 59 horse- power, and you still can't take a simple corner at full speed without sliding off the track and all the other cars passing you, the other cars are of the same make as yours and run at the same speed so there's almost no way to catch up with them afterwards. In short this game is bad."
1,disappointed,This book...supposedly published in 2011(4th edition)...looked like it had been usedsince 1980. It was not what I thought I was purchasing. Big disappointment.Will not shop like this again.
5,Fast Paced and Full of Action,"We liked the DVD as it was action packed and full of spills, tosses, stomps, and bulls kicking some butt!The DVD is broken into segments. The music is matched well to the action. the last segment is a Q&A; to the riders and one of the Bull Fighters.I personally cheer for the bulls; I don't want to see anyone get seriously hurt, naturally. But it is fun to watch the Bull or Bronc toss a tough cowboy to the ground and watch him run and scurry away. I did a lot of cheering watching this DVD.There is no blood or gore. A few guys get beat up a bit as can be expected, but it is safe for the ages, unless you don't think riding bulls is appropriate for some, then, I suppose you would not be reading this review would you?Overall I give it thumbs up!I would recommend this DVD. I think it would be a nice gift to give to someone difficult to shop for...as long as the have at least a bit of an interest in the sport."
4,cowboy up,"good dvd, a little dated, but still a lot of bull ridding. Its a wondered that these guys don't all get killed when they fall off"
5,Diva Jazz,"Chaka's timeless pipes do great work in this concert. My guests where totally entertained and quite spellbound because they had not heard her perform live Jazz. If you are over the age of 45. You will love this work. Rememeber, extremely few get ""Live"" and perfect in the same review. I have only seem one. ""CHIC"" live at Montreau"
3,Dont bring Chaka out with this band again.,"The reason Chaka doesnt really ""shine"" on this DVD is because of the band. Though they are good musicians, I think they are BET studio musicians or something. I've seen this on other BET DVDs that I own. I am pretty sure that Chaka didnt pick the band on this production. As such, I think she seems uninspired because the band doesnt give her a goal to hit. I know if you brought out members of her previous live encounters you would really have something here. She knows how to sing jazz and anybody who thinks otherwise has got rocks in their head."
1,Out of her depth or just not suited to jazz?,"We bought this DVD on the strength of Chaka's excellent performance on Fourplay's ""An Evening of Fourplay"". However, my wife said after the second listening of this other DVD, that she is either out of her depth or she has chosen the wrong songs. I tend to agree - Chaka comes across like a less than smooth, poor man's version of Natalie Cole on this DVD. Her voice is OK in the lower register but it turns into a flat screechy monotone when she aims a bit higher. Her band is excellent and without them it would all be a total loss. In fact, we could easily have listened to the band alone - unfortunately their peformance is ruined by a less than stellar performance by Chaka Khan."
3,Good Concert With Engineering Mishap,"As noted by an ealier reviewer there is an engineering mishap with this BET Jazz DVD release. This performance by Chaka Khan is very good. but while the disk offers the DTS and 5.1 options it's rather the 2 channel stereo option (plus PL2 Music on my Sony amplifier) that channels sound into the center speaker, not the other two.BET studios, if you're listening, please do correct this error."
3,Passive,"Was very disappointed with this DVD. From the very beginning I asked myself, ""Why did I order it""? It didn't have the depth of character that is Chaka Khan. It will not remain in my collection.Someone who is looking for a more laid back sound will enjoy this one."
2,Too Old School Jazzy Chaka for me,"I am a huge Chaka Khan fan and have seen her sing jazz before but this video didn't meet my expectations at all. It was kind of boring actually...old school jazz songs, wasn't what I was expecting at all and they should at least put the song list somewhere where you can see it before purchasing it."
1,American made junk,Purchased January 2011 and was very satisfied initially. However after about twelve months of use the welds for two of six legs had severe cracks which made the unit unsafe to use. I contacted the manufacturer and was told they would send replacement leg studs but I would have to have them replaced at my expense. I expected a longer life span than twelve months and I am very disappointed this made in America crap.
1,Great until the leg fell off,"In the interest of full disclosure, I have had this rebounder for 2 years.My teens loved it and used it regularly.However recently the leg broke off, can not reattach unless I take it to a welder.None of my kids are over 150 lbs and were using it properly.Will not buy another of this brand."
5,Well worth the price,"We had two rebounders before this. The first one ($40) had springs that kept breaking, and the second one ($100) had a mat that failed (stitches broke). It was 'rated' for a 200lb person but the only one who used it was my son (100lbs). The Needak is really well-made and has a great warranty. We wasted $140 learning that we should have bought a Needak in the first place.UPDATE (November 2009):My son continues to use the Needak rebounder daily. The mat literally wore out from use and Needak sent out a new one the same day with absolutely no hassle. This is a quality product, backed by a quality warranty that they stand behind. Now that we have had experience with their warranty we are even more delighted that we chose Needak."
2,Product leaks,"Took two pump bottles on a camping trip in the Sierras and they leaked terrible! Fortunately I had double-bagged them in Ziplock bags. I was able to spread the leakage on my body by hand, which did keep the mosquitos off for hours."
1,Do not buy this,The packaging leaks. Deet is a powerful chemical that will melt plastic and destroy synthetic clothing fibers. I purchased 4 of these and all of them ate through their packaging rendering them useless (I received them this way). It was a sticky gooey mess and the whole thing was a waste of money.
1,Off Container Leaked and Made a Terrible Mess,"I just returned from a backpack trip into the Sierra's. I brought along the 1 oz. Deep Woods Off! for Sportsman. After climbing over a high 11,000' pass, I discovered half the liquid leaked out (even though I kept it in a plastic bag) and spread over my backpack. The liquid melted part of another plastic container and I think it is slowly disolving the nylon on the Kelty packpack. I tried washing it off the pack with soap, but the sticky-ness does not seem to clean off. Why would a company design a product called ""Deep Woods"" and ""For Sportman"" if it cannot withstand a backpack trip?"
5,Definitely does the job,It's true that you might experience problems with the packaging but for the most part it wasn't a big deal for me. Just double bag it. I can depend on this product in desperate situations!! Use it only when you really need it though.
3,Mainly preventive,"Purchased this product as a preventive measure against mosquito bites in advance of my trip to Dallas which at the time had an infestation of mosquitoes. Turns out, I didn't use it because the city had sprayed and I didn't venture outside of the sprayed areas. Will keep it for future use in my medicine drawer."
2,my choice to stop mosquitos - but hard to use on clothes,i like the high concentration of deet in this versionsome products have a lot less in themi like the design with the pump and two side guidesothers have an open pusher that spins as i push down and i cant tell where the spray will end upthe downside is this is a stream only not a spray so impossible to put on clothes without soaking spots and others not getting anyokay to use by putting on hands and applying to skin but i dont want chemicals on my skini ended up using the other version with the spinning spray nozzle and doing the best i could with it even though it was difficultso - clothes 1 starand hand apply 5 starsnet two cause i only care about clothes application
2,Not in condition expected,"Item was described as in very good condition but a good number of the pages are entirely covered in notes. Not what I would consider ""very good condition."""
3,Full of statistics- -but no references,"This book is a succinct overview of all aspects of Japanese education. It covers everything from school fees and uniforms, to textbooks, independent after school activities, school violence, and university reforms. The book is full of statistics; unfortunately, it contains no references or suggested sources for more information. The information is quite frank, describing the negative aspects of Japanese education as well as the positive. In several places, the Japanese educational system is compared to that of the US. In these places it becomes clear that the Nemoto has an extremely superficial understanding of the US system. Readers would be advised to go elsewhere for information about the US. On the other hand, for a concise description of Japanese education, this book would be hard to beat."
2,not *that* clever,"This was disappointing, compared to most Klutz books. It did not grab the attention of my budding-photographer eleven-year-old. The camera included was no better than a disposable one."
5,"Light-weight, Easy to carry -- A great tool!","It's just the right size. It fits in either my left or right hand well (the left a little better). It is convient to use. I like skipping past messages easily & quickly; something you couldn't do with a microcassette recorder. And, it is alot easier to record thoughts during the commute to/from work than the memo pads I've seen that people have attached to their dashboards.Will it replace a cassette recorder or microcassette recorder for recording lectures or meetings? No. Based on the design of the product, that was and is not it's purpose.A great product! I carry it with me everywhere."
3,Good design.,"The best of V90 is its ergonomic design. It fits well in both left and right hand and also easy to control. However, on mode LP 90 minute the sound was terrible. For 33 minute mode the sound was excellent."
4,Someone please help me with this.,"This item looks cool.I really want to buy it BUT... how would i get this onto my computer?Does it have flash or some kind of memory stick? Does it come with an adapter? Please help me, i need it for my science class,I would definately appreciate it.if its coo, please email : Ronsingh911@yahoo.com"
3,just one problem,"All the reviews I read were correct - ease of operation, barely had to read the manual to get going. I was very happy with this gadget except for one problem - In my bag or briefcase, it constantly goes on accidently with any movement (looking through the bag for something, pushing the bag aside, etc.) I have wiped out previous messages this way, as well as taped entire conversations unintentionally. Makes the gadget much less convenient, since I have to be careful where I keep it."
4,They don't all survive the wash!,"I didn't have the same luck as the reviewer whose recorder survived the washing machine (and dryer) - mine is dead.However, I did find the thing very handy while I had it. The sound quality is great, and it is small enough to carry in a pocket. The only complaint I would have is that since there were only a few buttons on it, some of the features were very non-intuitive (hold x button for two seconds then press y button until yadda-yadda appears, etc.) I didn't find it worth the storage space in my ever-shrinking memory to remember all the programming features, so they went unused.Overall, very good product."
5,Exceptional!,I've had mine for over a year and I absolutely love it! It's easy to use and the play back is crisp and clear. Very well made and thought out ... the unit sits neatly in the palm of your hand allowing finger tip control. A great value and high quality product!
3,I really like it but it keeps breaking!,I like for form and features of this voice recorder but I have now had 2 of them break!
2,Died after about 9 months daily use,A great item but it quit playing back after about 9 months of use. You could get bits of the messages by holding the mode button down momentarily. The gold paint wears off carrying it in your pocket.
2,not what I expected,"This review is rather a first impression than a final sentence. I am a Luther fan and I like good books. Being a pastor I thought I might find some of Luther's strong prayers in a form that I could use in services. However, the book is not layed out that way. Some of the prayers are still nice, but very personal. However, it is not the right thing to just read as a personal devotional either. The prayers are sorted by topics, though. Another thing I did not like is that the print almost appears to be scanned images rather than set print. It appears unclear, like photocopies in the old days. It is not pleasant for the eye to read. Maybe I am a little too critical, but it just wasn't what I had hoped for."
4,Not bad for the money,"I bought this for the reception area in my studio. It looks good paired with the folding acrylic chairs. Since the glass top sits on those rubber suction cups, it's difficult to move. You have to reach under the top and grab the bars that extend outward from the center pole. It serves its purpose well though."
5,An inspiring Interview,"Great interview with the legendary Whispers about the music industry and their personal success as well as some of the pitfalls they experienced as entertainers. This is not a live concert and they never promised it which is why I'm disappointed at some of the reviewers who gave it low marks because it wasn't a live concert. They advise and warn young entertainers about ""show business"" and encourage them to concentrate more on the ""business"" than the ""show""."
5,the whispers with debor'ah benton,"I just love this unexpected treat, i actually thought i was getting a dvd of music but was glad and wonderfully surprised to learn so much about the whispers, just great"
1,Interview,A good video if you want to know the history of the Whispers but not much singingThe Whispers with Debor'ah Benton
2,very disappointed,I thought i was getting a concert when all you get is interview with a few in studio songs (3) and not from their best songs. Interviews were interesting but I did not buy this cd to hear life stories.
3,A Whisper Fan,"This tv show was an inspiration to me. Thanks Whispers for sharing your wisdom about being in the music industry. I wish there could have been more singing to go along with the interviews. But overall thank you for allowing me the chance to see what goes on behind the scenes. And I'm glad to know you paid a visit to a high school music class, and giving the students some great pointers. Way to go!! Keep up the great work, much appreciated. Hope you'll get more concert video's on Amazon for your fans to purchase. Also Debor'ah, I don't want to leave you out, excellant job. May God continue to bless you all with much success.Lynn from OKC."
2,It should of came with the concert.,"The Whispers are one of my favorite groups, but for the price this costed.It should of came with the concert disc. But i did enjoy the T.V. show."
4,Excellent Resource - Beautiful Book,"When this book arrived it was a surprise how big it is, and how beautifully made. The pages are large, 12 by 11 inches, and there are lots of illustrations and photos. The information is extensive. It is very well organized, and each section has a good bibliography after it to facilitate further research. Whether you are interested in the New Haven area, particular areas of industry such as clockmaking or carriage manufacturers, workplaces in the proceeding centuries, or urban planning and development, you will find interesting and useful information in this book."
1,"Bad, bad, bad!","I want to echo the other reviewers' comments on the absolutely awful new animation on this video, as well as add that the original creators of Bugs Bunny must be rolling over in their graves over the way new (HORRIBLE!) footage was spliced into our old favorites. The video box showed the Jekyll/Hyde and Bugs and Vampire (Hocus-cadabra!) cartoons, and this is what I thought I'd get. Wrong!! Not only did they chop up the old ones and add crummy new animation (Bugs Bunny looks like a saber-toothed rabbit in most of them), they changed the great vampire voice to the witch's, in order to connect it with a weak storyline.In short, don't waste your time or money - even as a rental!!"
3,"Half Good, Half Bad","I borrowed this tape from the library since I'm not old enough to order over the internet. The first half of the cartoon is better, since the 'Halloween Hijinks' is a spliced-together TV special. 'Creature Features' is funnier, with 3 cartoons. First cartoon is 'Invasion of the bunny snatchers' where carrots from space clone Bugs Bunny's enemies; the clones are really nice. Second is 'The duxorcist', where Daffy has an exorcism for a posessed lady. This cartoon was a new part of the movie Quackbusters, which was another spliced-together special. Third is 'Night of the living duck' where Daffy gets hit on the head and appears in a Monster's nightclub to sing. I liked this part of the video better. The other half is made from old cartoons and in some places doesn't make any sense. At one point the witch goes from green to white skin colour and Porky's voice turns into Bugs' voice for one line. You could buy this video, but turn off the VCR after the first half."
1,So Embarassingly Bad,"This ""special"" is so incredibly bad it could become a cult classic. Here are some things to look for;*Porky's voice changing in mid-sentence*The Witch's complexion changing from green to white*Using the same exact animation for two Witch scenes*Bugs Bunny inexplicably turning into an umpireThis is a festering piece of garbage. The people who attempted to ""improve"" these classic Looney Toons and Merrie Melodies should be deported and sterilized."
2,I buy them because I have to,"The replaceable valve stems work much much better than any twist-on valve extender, so these are much better in that sense for my 808's.However, like most lite tubes, they flat way too often."
3,To know him is to adore him,"Probably one of Bon's finest work. With a ROUND & ROUND & ROUND that makes you boogie all night long, even with the shorted version of it. CAREY GULLY makes you see the good in him(a DANONE commercial almost). TO KNOW YOU IS TO LOVE YOU has that sixties ballad music(the type of song you dance with your date at the end of a ball). Eventhough two songs aren't very groovy the other two are arse kickin'. Round and round has got to be one of Bon's greatest songs. A cd in which Bon shows that R&B isn't only his commitment."
5,No more pinched fingers,"I finally broke down and bought a new set of hedge trimmers! My other ones were dull and if I wasn't careful, my fingers would get pinched. Naturally I looked to Fiskars for my best options. My shrubs have never looked so good!!! I think my husband is going to hide them from me as I can't stop using it! The grip is very comfortably. My fingers don't get pinched, and it is very sharp!"
5,Good Sheers,"I bought myself these Sheers and ended up giving it to my daughter as she needed one, I ordered another for myself. Sharp and works well, super fast shipping."
5,Very comfortable to use.,"These shears are far superior to my old ones. I love the cushioned handles, they don't slip in my gloves like my old wooden handle shears. The bumpers are a great addition and cushion the impact nicely. Great for trimming the bushes around my house!"
4,GREAT FOR A QUICK TRIM!!,"I found that these Sheers are nice for a quick trim of your bushes. If you are doing major work, I would use the electric trimmer. But, quick trim because you have company coming, this would do the trick. I don't find them extremely sharp. Fairly good product for the price."
1,Fiskar failure,"I chose a pair of these hedge trimmers at Home Depot based on the Fiskars name. I took them home and used them for about 15 minutes when they locked up. The blades bent into each other at the tip causing them to lock up and even chipped the blade. Thought it was fluke, took them back and exchanged for another pair. Got home, made about five cuts, same thing. Took them back and got a refund. I examined them and found the problem ""Made in China"" These may be a counterfit copy as the steel is cheap junk."
1,Fiscars sheers useless,"I bought 3 pair of fiscars 22"" hedge sheers for my garden crew and all three pair literally fell apart in 4 days!"
1,Agree with others about the pin,Pin popped out of the hinge after about 5 uses. It's garbage now. Will be ordering another brand. Don't waste your money.
3,"Sturdy, but not holding an edge","These clippers appear to be made reasonably well and I'll be happy to get a few years out of them. However, after having them in service for only a week, it's time to take the file to them. I haven't chopped anything much larger than a pencil diameter, but that seems to be enough to dull the edge."
2,Sturdy but does not open wide enough,"I bought these to replace old dull trimmers. They are very sturdy and very sharp, But they don't open wide enough so it takes twice as long to trim the bushes. I prefer using the dull trimmers."
5,Descriptive and concise guide,"I bought this book to create a moderately complex project management database. My coworker, with limited Access experience and no database development experience, used this book to quickly create our database. It was easy for her to follow and had answers for her questions on how to set each area up. The database works well. I didn't know if a basic book would have all the answers we needed. However, the instruction is clear and easy to follow. It's a small book but it does not sacrifice learning. I give it a high rating for our purpose."
5,Learning how to write poetry,"This product was very helpful. My professor actually required it for an intro to poetry writing class, and the text is very well organized and understandable. It helps you to write all kinds of poems from free verse, to sonnets, and helps break down certain tools and poetic devices used in all poems. It's definatly a well written guide to poetry, and all of the poems used as examples are very interesting and fun to read!"
4,Fun read.,A fun read. Good to see the characters from previous books get a story of their own. Enjoyed the recipes too.
2,The Lobster would jump out of the pot to get away from this book.,"This is the first time I read this author, the book sounded cute,however it just draggs on and on, without ever getting to the point. I was extremely disappointed, and would not recommend this author again.,"
4,Too many fast songs,I like this one ok...too many fast songs.....I enjoy Jeffery slow songs. Not enough slow music. But it was ok
5,Never disappoints...,Jeffrey Osborne is a unique talent and his consistency over the years is phenomenal! He never disappoints!
3,DTS with no center channel,"This is another of the BET series DVDs with something missing. While picture quality, sound and performance are all excellent I do not receive sound in the center speaker when I select the DTS option. BET studios should look into this engineering mishap in their future releases."
5,Thorough coverage of a complex subject,"If you're thinking of adding on to your home, this is the best one-volume comprehensive text on both the design and construction process on the market. As a former builder (fifty custom homes, a 46-home subdivision, and commercial projects) who has worked with many architects, I found the principles of addition design laid out here to be thorough, practical and well-illustrated. Every house and every addition is unique, and so understanding the principles is the key to good design. This book also explains much about the construction process, including material take-offs, job planning and other essential topics for any owner or owner-builder.Taunton Press has an well-deserved reputation for quality construction books, and this is an excellent example of a comprehensive treatment of large, complex subject. As a writer for the San Francisco Chronicle Home section, I would recommend this book unreservedly to any homeowner considering an addition."
2,Not a good book for architects,"Altough there are some nice projects illustrated in this book, it is apprearent that the author, a contractor, has little respect for architects. The author is only in favor of a 'design-build' approach and exclaims that there is usually a ""mistaken assumption that the construction documents adequately describe the work"" and that in order for an architect to do an accurate set of drawings and specs ""there would be hardly any money left to build with"". Inaccurate and absurd."
3,Cruzin Cooler Review,"Took 3 months to receive, still haven't received the coolagon!! Ordered two. Mine arrived with brake cable and rear end damaged. My husbands screw backed out of the rear the first day he rode it and damaged the screw-another week for replacement. Week for replacement for my brake cable. Seriously, for that much money to have this much trouble-do not recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Attention-getter but not well built,"This is my 3rd Cruzin' Cooler in addition to the Coolagon (trailer). I got them for me and my grandkids- we all think they're cool. Unfortunately, the axle nuts, seat back, and front fork tend to work loose and fall off quite often. Keep the tool kit handy and check every nut and bolt often. Also, the cooler I ordered from the mfg's web site came with batteries that were bad after just 3 months. I got replacements from Batteries Plus for about $10.00 more apiece than the originals and they run about 30% longer than the other good ones I have. Everybody we see with them are fascinated...it's sort of like carrying a newborn with you- they really are fun."
5,Head Turner for Sure!,These things are awesome - trade shows; drag races or anything. They fly on concrete; a little slow on the grass but they work ok with a 200 lb guy; rated up to 350 lbs!
1,RIDICULOUS!,"This item arrived BROKEN. That was 7 weeks ago. I have been on the phone over 5 times (for an average of 30-45 minutes each time) with the dimwits at Amazon trying to get it sent back. Granted they sent a replacement, but after 30 days they charge you for the replacement if they haven't received the original. Well, 4 times now they have arranged for a pickup, and guess what I am looking at right now. The package. Still. In all of it's broken glory. It's also worth mentioning that the replacement ALSO arrived broken (the motor was cracked off of the interior casing, but we fixed it to avoid more hassle from amazon."
2,Junk,"I just got my cooler and the battery is bad,it is all scratched up, and 2 tires are flat. This is overpriced china junk."
3,Solid album,"First of all, this is not a trash or speed metal band like megadeth or metallica used to be. This is melodic power metal so if u r expecting to hear some trash./speed metal dont buy this album. However, if u like power metal it is a fun album to listen to."
2,Hitch looks good but not all pieces arrived,"The delivery was quick and it looks like a very well built hitch, unfortunately, the tongue that holds the ball was missing. I informed AutopartsWay about the missing piece and they wanted me to ship the whole thing back for an exchange. That's most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. I already mounted it on the vehicle, figuring that AutopartsWay would send me the missing piece. I told them this and they said they would try to work with the company to get them to send the missing piece. Apparently, they buy the hitch from someone else. Meanwhile they sent me an RMA number that I'm not going to use. I'm not going to remove the hitch from the car just to do this.One other issue, the directions were not that accurate and one of the plates for mounting was missing a couple of holes that are supposed to be pre-drilled. I drilled them out on my drill press."

1,Don't bother buying this!,We didn't find this useful at all. Just a fun concept :) Practically speaking I would rather suggest placing some facial tissues very gently to cover your little one's wee wee while changing diaper. For us that works much better than this.
2,Never used these,"Not really functional. My son doesn't pee too often while changing, so I lucked out. He does pee every time I bathe him, but we are already in the tub, so I don't worry about this. These are more fun than functional."
4,Simple but useful,"The first week my newborn son was home I was peed on countless times. After receiving these Peepee Teepee's I continue to stay dry. Now that I am a diaper changing pro I use them only when changing a poopy diaper because that is more time consuming than a simple pee filled diaper. The only reason i did not give this product 5 stars is it does take one hand to hold the peepee teepee on while you change because it will fall off otherwise. Other selling points to me were they are easily washed in washing machine and pretty absorbent for their size. Any baby shower I go too now that is for a little boy, these are my go to gift. I consider them a must have for a baby boy."
3,More of a funny product,I bought these about 4 weeks after my first little boy was born. The pee pee tee pee works ok when I'm giving him a bath if it's soaking wet to give it weight. They arent wide enough to go around to keep it on there so they don't pee everywhere. If the baby doesn't move at all while you are changing him they works great. I recommend them for sure with baths. They're super funny too.
2,They are ok,"This is an ok product, but my baby was really too big for them at birth. He would immediately kick them off. I think they are cute, but not really functional."
3,Boys will be boys ;),"I got this to aid in diaper changes and it does keep from getting it on you but it doesn't soak up anything just blocks, I made some of my own with more layers and those worked out better."
4,Glad we have them,"Someone got us these as a gift when our son was born. At first I thought it was a waste but I reallylike having them. Some people say they have trouble keeping it in place while changing the diaper and I can see this. However, this has save us from being peed on on more then one occassion. And a quick tip: I would put them in a lingerie bag when washing. We washed the first set without the bag and we lost a couple and the ones we still had ddn't hold up well when just thrown in the wash. They have done fine once I started putting them in the bag though."
4,Super cute...but,its more of a novelty item. I bought these when my son was born and he was so squirmy they would just fall right off his peepee. But they are so darn cute!
3,We don't really use them!,"When our son was a new born, we had so many accidents. The Peepee Teepees would be great them. Once he got a little older and wiggled around, they would just fall off and it became another thing to worry about needing a 3rd or 4th hand for."
2,Novelty only...,"This is a very cute and fun item, but not functional at all. This could be a good silly shower gift, but the reality is that it doesn't work. It's impossible to hold the peepee teepee in place while changing the baby. Once baby squirms the teepee falls right off. Takes more energy to try to keep the teepee in place, than to just quickly change the baby."
2,Not very practical,"I had such high hopes for this product, after realizing my son turned into a little fountain at every diaper change. Each individual tee-pee is quite small, and I find it hard to hold it over the right spot while doing the actual wiping and diaper changing at the same time. It just doesn't stay in place when you have a squirming baby. I find folding up a paper towel and putting it over him is just as effective and easier to handle."
2,Waste of money,"We tried to use these a few times, but now they just sit in a drawer. They're too small and don't stay on when the baby moves and kicks during a change. We have a dedicated diaper-duty washcloth for the purpose now. Cute idea but just not functional."
3,"Cute novelty, but that's all it is.","It's a good novelty product, but the baby moves too much when changing such that the pee pee tee pee falls off the wee wee when changing diapers, and you still get sprayed in the face."
1,cute idea but useless,"I got these as a gift. They are cute and funny, but useless. They don't stay on while you wipe your baby. Also, if it does stay on, the pee just leaks on to baby's sides. So, we just place a washcloth over him and it absorbs the pee much better :)."
2,Save your money - use a washcloth or cloth diaper,"These are absolutely adorable, but they don't stay in place between baby's wiggling legs. I use a washcloth or drape a cloth diaper over baby's legs - works much better and absorbs much more pee pee than the tee pee!"
1,"funny gift, but not practical",We bought these thinking that we'd use them instead of the many washcloths that we were using as covers during diaper changes. They are tiny - they don't stay on and are expensive for what you get. We are back to using washcloths.
3,They're not bad,"These things are very cute as a novelty item. At first I thought that was all they were good for. They do not stay on unless you hold it on, which is too hard when changing a diaper. I did find out that they do work great once the baby has started peeing. I keep them right next to his changing pad and if he happens to stream, I put one on right away and hold it there. It soaks up the pee and prevents an even bigger mess from being made. They're very absorbent and I do like that I have them, but with little boys, some pee escaping seems to be unavoidable."
3,Fun and semi-effective,"They do fall off as others have said, but if you have one near by you can catch all but the first few seconds of a fountain (more if you have a quick-draw-instinct)."
3,convenient,These Greenlee self drilling taps are very convenient. The only drawback is you must be very careful when using with a drill after drill breaks through metal tap somtimes snaps and binds and snap off in metal. Low setting on adjustable tension cordless drills work well.
5,worked like a charm,I have a beginners violin and expected the pegs to slip. This product fixed the problem easily. Honestly I think this product is a bit over priced but is a similar price anywhere else you can buy these drops. it wasn't messy either.
3,It does the job!,These drops ar invalueable for slipping pegs. I use it on my violin and it holds well even on old strings.
4,Good,I have a 1918 Chezch Violin and it's sparked my 11 year olds interest. My pegs are in great shape but I figured I'd get this oil to make starting to play the violin easier on him.
5,Fantastic Drops for violin,"The pegs kept slipping, and the violin wasn't able to stay tuned. I ordered this and used it minutes upon arrival. What an amazing product. The pegs don't slip at all anymore. Even though you use hardly any of this and the bottle will last a long time, it was a WONDERFUL investment."
4,This makes it much easer to tune using the pegs,"Before using the peg drops, I could not get small tuning changes by turning the pegs.This stuff really works!"
2,Stuck Pegs,"Yes, this helped stop pegs slipping. Now they are really hard to turn. Perhaps this will resolve itself in time, but for now it has been a disappointment as tuning is still a frustration."
1,Did not work,"I bought a cheap student violin to practice fixing violins. The pegs were creaky so I threw the peg drops into the cart while buying Dominant strings and a Baggs pickup. After soaking into the pegs for a week, the product did not make them turn easier or tune better. In fact, the pegs were even creakier and the ""A"" peg got stuck. Back to the soap and chalk method for me."
5,Also works great on lutes!,"I have an inexpensive travel lute. The pegs are not that great. I tried peg dope, but it didn't really help that much. These drops really helped stop the slipping. All the strings were slipping a half note off. 15 strings is no joke to tune. After applying peg drops, only one or two strings were down a half step. Big improvement!"
5,"Authentic photos, clear text, and variety of subjects","This non-fiction book talks openly about the the Tlingit way of life now and in the past. Accompanied by black and white and more recent colored photos . Nice , large print for young readers with simple informative text. Pictures on every page. This would be a good addition to elementary school rooms especially in Alaska."
2,"It was the right book, but in pretty bad conditions","I recently bought a Bio. 3 book. I received it in about a week in half, it was exactly the right book, but it was in pretty bad conditionsthe envelope was all dirty and broken, so it was the book.I always buy my books on line, and i had never received anyone in this condition.what i notice was that the person who sent it to me did not used a bubble envelope.All the other books that i had bought before had arrived in a bubble envelope and i had always received then in great conditions."
2,HARD TO FOLLOW,I just finished my biology class with this text book. Over all I was very disappointed in this book. I read each chapter that was assigned to us by the professor and worked my study guides but still came out of the each chapter more confused. With the jargon they put in this text book it doesn't do the student any favors in the layouts you will need to spend time to investigate some of the information on your own to obtain a better understanding of BIOLOGY.
1,Ripoff,"For nearly $50 with ""Hits of"" as part of the title, I expected a more comprehensive songbook. What I got was only 12 songs. Frankly I feel ripped off. Granted I did choose to buy it, but I wouldn't have if the songbook contents were listed, and I couldn't find them on the internet."
3,Fine for the price.,"When I bought this in two years ago it cost 18 bucks plus tax. For that price it has certainly delivered. It's best feature was the soldering iron, relatively easy to light and it would stay lit for the good part of an hour and sometimes even longer. It gets hot rather quickly. I have dropped this, stepped on it and I even left it out in the rain one day and to this day it still runs like a champ.If you are looking for a good micro torch you might as well keep looking. The torch did an ok job but it always liked to blow itself out the very moment you piece got up to temperature. It doesn't have a lighter build in, so it takes a little extra effort to light it.Anyway for the price and for what I needed it for it has served it's purpose, I recently upgraded to a portasol superpro 125. What a difference, but with a $80 price tag there should be.Also if you search bernzomatic micro torch kit you can get it a tad cheaper."
3,"Torch useful, solder tip not so much","I picked one of these up locally and found it to be a mixed bag. It's a nice form fit in the hand, and the torch is really handy when you need a fine tipped flame, but I was hoping to use it more for soldering. I've had nothing but fits using the soldering tip. First it's a pain to light in that you apparently have to spring it forward, but when you try to close it, fast or slow, it puts the flame out about 9 out of 10 times and you have repeat the process. Second, it doesn't seem to ever get hot enough to melt tin-based solders which is what is mostly used in electronics work. I'll keep it around for the torch, but I've given up entirely on using the solder tip."
2,Engineer,The solder attachment does not heat up enough to melt solder. So don't buy it if you want to solder. It does have a good flame though.
2,Frustrating,"I bought this mini-torch with the intent of using it to do basic copper pipe and electrical soldering, but I've given up on it. First of all, filling the torch with butane is problematic and messy; about half the fuel makes it into the unit and the other half everywhere else. Then when it does stay lit for any appreciable length of time (which isn't regularly), it self-extinguishes when held at certain angles. I worked and worked with it and tried every conceivable thing to make it operate better, short of taking it apart, but to no avail. I've gone going back to my old soldering iron, and propane-canister torch, which have worked well for 40 years."
2,not a favorite tool in my arsenal,"As a marine mechanic, I would steer you away from this micro torch. It does do a nice job soldering, and, sure, it shrinks electrical terminals without burning them, but only when it feels like igniting. Some times the gas flows upon switching the butane switch on and sometimes it doesn't. Very inconvenient when shoehorned into an engine compartment. Lately, I've been wondering just how well this torch kit floats."
2,Several Problems,"Pro: Price, SizeCon:Doesn't fill easily. About 20% of used butane goes into torch the rest into air.Not that easy to start. Goes out oftenWith solder tips side ports vent hot flame into work areaSolder tips do not seem to heat. I needed to use flame for soldering with resultant burning of adjacent wiring insulation."
5,AWSOME!,Just picked up mine today and it is awesome! It isn't hard to light and comes with a bunch of other cool tools!!!! I highly recommend. Best pencil torch out there.
4,"An insiders view, not much analysis but powerful","I used this book in a class I teach on economic anthropology - the idea was to use it as a kind of 'workplace ethnography' to show students what the real life of sales is like. I also wanted to emphasize the point that the daily business of economics is more about social relationships than simply about money and exchange. The students liked the book and found parts of it very engaging, but I am not sure it helped get the message across. This is partially because the author is not very self-reflective - does not put his experience in perspective or make sense out of it, but it content to show how out-of-control a particular corporate culture became, how destructive it was to daily life. A useful lesson - and I will use the book again."
5,"An easy-to-read, for-all-readers algorithms book","This is a truly magnificent book. It comprehensively covers most of the topics in the analysis and design of alogorithms with no mathematical burden to hamper you from getting through this subjet. Later on, you will most probably need a more intensive and mathmetical-analysis oriented book but be sure this second book will be far more easy to go through after you have have finished the ""Algorithmics"" book. Enjoy it."
4,Great Introduction to Algorithms and Analysis,"This book is perfect for those whose interest has been piqued by the topic, but who lack the mathematical background required for the more advanced books. It's easy to understand and provides a lot of theory to get your mind running.Those with a solid background in the field should look for something with more depth and mathematical supporting material."
1,"Content OK, Religion NOT","I know this may be a computing classic since one tends to find this title on reading lists, but frankly I regret having bought it. I am not troubled by the contents of the book or the way Mr Harel describes them, however, I do strongly object to the fact that he continuously bothers the reader with bible quotations that seem to be growing on every second page like a malignant cancer. This may not offend you if you are Jewish or Christian, but short of that it is an annoyance of global proportions. If I want to read the Bible I will take a copy of the Bible and read it, but if I take a book about Algorithmics I don't want to be forced to combat missionaries. I will return this book asap!"
1,Great hardware but software makes it almost useless,"It's hard to beleive that someone would produce a player as good as this and then require software that makes it almost impossible to use. You are required to use SonicStage to maintain files in the player. If you have used any other similar tool (iTunes, Windows Media Player) you will not beleive how cumbersome this this is. There is nothing inutative or easy about it. My only assumption is that the software department wanted to do everything they could to see an otherwise outstanding hardware offering fail.If your goal is to spend the better part of a day to load music and then never change anything then you would be hard pressed to find something better. If you want something dynamic that can be easily integrated into your daily routine then you would be better served looking elsewhere."
1,Sony Connect Music Store is Closing,"This device can only download from Sony Connect Store which is closing March, 2008. After that, the device is useless. You can not use other online download sites but this device used a different format. I found many help sites with long instructions on how to convert a file, burn in on a cd, then...maybe you can download your PAID songs onto the device. I am not a computer buff. You can still play the songs already on the device and use the radio. But I purchased this item to download my personal music library. I have 3 of them. Not this one but the super one that was a 100.00. What a waste. YOu can return it and cant sell it. What a waste of money."
2,returned,I got this as a gift but returned it when I saw it. The diamond had a very flat top and was sunk so far down that it was barely visible. The gold seemed good but the diamond ruined the ring.
1,The Last Dats of Pompeii,Disappointed. I love Pompeii and have read everything I can about it and the disaster of 79ADI am waiting for Robert Brown's book to be made into a movie directed by Stephen Speilburg or Francis Ford CopolaI am not a fan of silent movies
3,"High quality, difficult to use","I want to start by saying that this tool, as I have found with all Gerber products is of high quality.Its drawback is its size and difficulty in opening the tools. It's small and hard to handle and the accessories are stiff and difficult to open.It's fine I suppose as just a back up to have on your keychain, but if you want a serious Multi-Tool that can handle a variety of chores and can handle the size and weight I would recommend a full size version!"
5,Hard to find in stores.,Don't waste your time with the new replacements. This is till the best. Hard to find at wallyworld/academy. Stock up while you can.
2,"Useful, But...","This is a good tool to use in a variety of situations, if you can get the components open. If you have a set of keys, you can use them to pry the screwdriver heads from the handle. I found a better brand for a cheaper price and still kept the small size that I needed. Keep searching, there are still quality tools on the market."
2,So far I see no change ...,"I've been using this product on one side of my body for a month. I'm using cetaphil lotion on the other side. So far there's no difference - in fact the cetaphil side feels softer.Right now I'd say save your money, but I guess it's too soon to say."
5,George Brookbank is the real thing,"Everything else I've read on desert garneding is junk. George actually lived here. He actually answered the phone at the extension service, etc. I've grown stuff I never would have tried. When something dies unexpectedly, I usually find out what I should have done in this book. Buy it first."
1,Terrible illustrations and photos- returned it,"I ordered this book based upon reviews. It was terrible. The book looked like it was published in the 1970's and never updated. The photos are all black and white, out of focus on some, and horribly printed. I returned the book for a refund because it did me no good to have text, talking about a gardening bug or fungus that coincided with a photo I couldn't make out. Don't buy it unless you are a text only sort of person."
2,Desert Landscaping,"Gardening in the desert is a challenge. Preserving the look and feel of the desert should be the goal. In this book George Brookbank takes you through the most elementary of garden tasks in a month-by-month guide.It's a helpful text book for newcomers to the desert.Fritzie von Jessen, author of Tough Plants in a Fragile Land: Saving our Planet, one Garden at a Time."
2,Desert?,"A fair amount of information, but I was expecting info more directly centered on the problems and solutions of the title itself. This book seems to paint with too broad a brush and misses its' title by a wide margin. I was looking for info, i.e. what plants are best, which plants aren't, etc."
4,Books,"Helpful for my British Literature class. Nice to be able to go to any location quickly, but not always sure that the layout is original, which sometimes matters with poetry."
2,Has bugs!,"This worked, but not very well. The delay was annoying and the random signal sent to mute my radio but unbearable not I uninstalled it."
2,not very good,very hard to get it to keep settings.infrared eye has to be epoxyed in because of thickness of material where it is inserted.if you ignore half of the steps it helps.this is very frustrating to install.you are pretty much stuck with this unit if you want to keep steering wheel controls.i personally dont think its worth the effort.
5,WOW - Let's get started!,"I was anxious to start beading prior to getting this book. NOW, I can hardly wait. It really opened my eyes to all the possibilities! I know so much more about supplies, designs, and how easy it is - after reading this book. Job well done."
2,Mediocre Learning Tool,This product is a mediocre learning tool. It could be used by the inexperienced to get a very basic explaination of the tools need to start beading. The experienced could possibly use it for the various projects explainations included. As someone new to this craft I will be seeking aid elsewhere to further explain the various ways to bead.
5,Getting Started beading,"I really enjoyed my book, the instructions are easy to follow and I can see myself using the book for years to come."
2,Bittersweet Memories,"I chose this item for a Christmas present for my mama, she loved country music. I don't. Unfortunately, she was put on life support one week before Christmas and passed away the day after, therefore she never had the opportunity to hear Battle of New Orleans."
1,appalling,This man is a charlatan. Instead of reading this rubbish it would be more advisable to have another look at Andersen's story 'The Emperor's New Clothes'. Cohen is a cocky little upstart with a huge inferiority complex and a group of sad gullible followers who do not have the courage to go it alone and would rather surrender their integrity and spirit of skeptical self-enquiry to this autocratic control freak just for the sake of an illusory spiritual comfort and sense of elitist self importance. Tragic.
1,This man is false,I agree with my fellow reviewers below that Cohen is tricking people. His manner and way of talking to people when seen in action gives it away. He is clearly not awake rather completely asleep. Actually I feel tired just thinking of him. I cannot write anymore.
3,Cheap bottle,Not worth the money as bottle is flimsy and crushes easily. No better than a free water bottle as recycler.
2,Not impressed,I am disappointed in the quality of the water bottle. It is a very very thin plastic bottle. It does not seem very durable. I don't see it lasting long after daily use.
3,Complicated,"I bought this about two years ago. It died on me last week. I was cooking a pot roast and the temp read as if the roast was done. I took it out and let it rest. When I cut into it the roast was raw. I like rare meat, but this was completely raw. I tried a little test and found that the temp was completely off. It worked for two years. But during the two years it took a series of button presses to get it to read the correct temperature. The probe and connected wiring always got tangled up. It was a serious learning curve to work with this unit and just when I thought I got it right, it died. So, my review is entitled complicated, just as this little unit is. I am currently looking for a less complicated thermometer."
3,"Lasted 2 years, now broken","Over a two year period this thermometer has been accurate and I enjoyed the alert on the thermometer for when we were roasting meats. Unfortunately the thermometer broke after two years of moderate use, and thus I won't be buying this one again."
4,Great working probe,"I am tired of guessing if my dinners are done and wasting cooking time by constantly opening and closing the oven door. This probe thermometer worked great and has done its job so far. The one downside is the preprogrammed taste settings of rare, m. Rare etc... I will not be using these in the future because they are set too high. Our roast came out medium to medium well instead of rare to medium rare, even when we took it out 6 degrees before the probe would have indicated to allow it to rest and finish cooking. From now on we will use our own numbers which are at least 10 degrees less than the presets. Still a good probe and will use again and again."
1,CDN Digital Thermometer Model DTP-482 Faulty Probe,"I thought the metal-braided cable-to-probe was a sound idea to protect the main component ... namely the PROBE, for goshsakes!Wrong. I am careful with it when used and when put away in a drawer. Nonetheless, the CDN DTP-482 arrived 1 September and this is 2 December and she won't function.I am drying potatoes from the harvest in my TSM Dehydrator. The indicated temperature on the CDN was, for example, 125F . Then the temp started to blink HH, then LL then strange numbers. If I jiggle the probe cable, the reading would stabilize. For a while.This time I am unable to get it to remain reading. This started about a month ago. However, the problem did not persist and we thought nothing of it.Now it's totally unusable."
1,Never worked right,"this never worked right. Don't waste your money. I should have returned it , but I didnt test it when it came.....plus....... it's not worth paying return shipping fees....I should have bought local, and could have returned it for my money."
3,Wasn't accurate measuring hot liquid for home brewing,"This thermometer/timer was purchased to use as a back up for home brewing. I understand it's designed to be used for cooking meat, but figured it would also work with reading water temps.It was consistently reading 6-10 degrees warmer than any of the analog thermometers I was also using.I decided to trust the good old fashioned analog readings, though they tend to be slightly slower.I was still able to use the timer function, but this ends up being a rather expensive timer. I can probably put it to use with my smoker/grill at some point."
1,Horrible product,This thing worked right like 2 times.After that if i went by the reading i'd cook a chicken breast for a hour..It was off by like 50 degrees.waste of money very disappointed
1,do not buy this - not accurate,"My husband bought this and it is worthless. I have overcooked syrups and caramels, as the readings are way off. Do not waste your money."
5,I hope to encourage others,Excellent product and excellent service from the company selling it. Had knowledge of the thermometer before purchasing as was not disappointed.
2,better products available,"The one I received did not work, the return was very easy. Other con, the timer does not show seconds. I had a Polder that was great. Still, the straight thermometers are the fastest."
2,poorly engineered,"I bought this to add a little technology to the guess work of outdoor cooking. It has a number of features that are totally useless to me. The countdown and count up feature; why?. The buzzer that tells you when you reach temp is so weak as to be useless also. I can't hear it even when standing next to it. The ""pork"" setting only goes to 165 well done, whichis a full 30 degrees under what I cook a pork butt to. This leaves me with a plain jane temp readout thermometer, whick is all I really wanted anyway.Here's the kicker. With the module sitting on the grill table, in the sun, the readout fails! I have to take the unit into the house to cool down and then plug it back in to the probe to get a reading. This thing does not do what it is designed for. Maybe I was expecting too much for my money. It is junk."
1,Terrible,"Unfortunatley for me, I used this after the return period expired, and it did not even from the get go. It could not read the temperature and now I am stuck with it, in the garbage it goes. Do not buy this"
1,Ordered 2 and they both failed with one use!,"We had one of these for years -- it worked great on the grill and in the oven. Nothing fancy just worked. When it finally died we ordered two more (a few weeks ago) -- one for the house and one for the cottage. The first trial was easter sunday, when our ham was showing readings between 40 and 500 degrees before it just said ""LL"" and that was it. So we opened the other one and got a good reading -- for a few minutes before it started showing HH and hasnt worked since. Maybe they changed it or something but both of these were total junk. I will definitely avoid these and search for a more robust brand.In case any manufacturers actually read these -- how about making at least one quality model? I'd gladly pay $10-20 more if you could just make a simple, high quality model that lasts. Instead you risk you brand name on cutting the last penny -- doesnt make sense."
4,"works well, missing a couple features","this unit works well, the probe wire is plenty long for the grill or smoking, it comes with magnets to mount the unit in many places.cons: no fish option for meat,you can only use the preset temps for the meats in the unit for the timer( you cannot set the alarm to go off at specific temps, you have to chose a meat option beef, chicken, turkey, veal, lamb and then choose a taste option rare, med rare, well. so temp options for the alarm or very limitedI still like the unit, just need to keep an eye on your temps when you get in the ball park"
4,Love it but with a couple of flaws,"I've been using this for about a year and overall I really like it. It really takes the guess work out of cooking meats and allows me to socialize when I have guests instead of constantly checking the oven. I've found it to be extremely accurate and it has held up well even in high temperatures. My is with using the factory installed settings. They are way too high. For example, on the beef setting, it says rare is 140 degrees, when it should be 120-125 degrees. I think there's a way to set your own temperature, but it's not intuitive and so I just keep an eye on the internal readings. For those who have problems with incorrect readings, make sure that the probe is inserted in the middle of the meat and not against any bones. I always adjust the probe when getting closer to the end of the cooking to make sure it hasn't shifted."
1,Don't bother,"Nice unit until the temperature probe went wonky, after only the 3rd time we used it.I guess it's just an expensive kitchen timer now."
1,Worked for the first 10 minutes,"First use, seemed like everything was working fine when I put the roast in the oven - then within 20 minutes that alarm was off and the thermometer was showing 450+, which was hotter than the oven. I took everything out, reseated the probe and the temp still wouldn't got belown 300. Took out the battery, put the probe in the roast, put the roast in the oven, and then plugged in the probe to the digital readout. Looked like everything was good - for about 10 minutes. Returning."
2,Defective,"I've had mine for a year. Mine would never alarm when it reached the desired temperature setting. The idea is great for checking if my bread is actually done, I stick the probe in the center of a loaf of bread and close the oven towards the end of my baking time and when it reaches 200f I know it's done. What I was hoping is that I could set it down and program it to alarm when it reached 200f, but it never would do that. I even read the instruction manual =)"
1,Didn't Work,The digital thermometer didn't work. When the probe was in the meat the screen would not give a temperature reading. Even when the meat was fully cooked the screen just flashed random letters. Very disappointing!
2,Not Good Enough,"I bought a CDN for cheesemaking. It seemed to have a sturdy probe, but the unit itself was kind of flimsy and cheap. I successfully used it about 6 times, but each time I had to re-read the instructions as the design is not intuitive. The 7th time was the end though, as the thermometer began to give me readings much higher than normal (the liquid was definitely not up to body temperature yet I was getting readings of 170F). Repeated re-readings of the instrucitons, replacement of battery and switching on/off failed to change that.I am keeping the probe and throwing away the unit.Invest in something better."
4,Great product,First time I used a digital thermometer..worked just great...I would recomend this product. Next use will be in my smoker.when the weather warms up and I start smoking things for the spring.
5,"Feature packed, easy to use thermometer","This thermometer is great. It has presets for commonly cooked meats and even allows for meat to be cooked based upon tastes (rare, medium, etc). The probe itself is long enough and the cable feels sturdy. I've had too many of these where it feels like it will fall apart, this feels like it is very well made."
2,thermometer,Worked for Thanksgiving perfect. Got it out for my Xmas turkey and it wouldn't work at all. So not happy with my purchase
1,Broke the first time I used it,This item became worthless the first time we used it. It was inserted properly and we were watching the temperature go up and then all of a sudden it beeped over and over again and wouldn't stop beeping until I took out the batteries. I put the batteries back in and the letters LL and HH appeared instead of the temperature. I found no help in the paper instructions that came with it. No help online either. This just keeps the letters HH on the screen and I can't remove them with any push of the buttons and make this work again. Into the trash since I threw the box away already.
1,not so good,"Not reliable, temp readings all over the place and then started giving errors. I think the problem lies with the probe wire. Its weak and you can manipulate the readings by bending on the probe wire. Cheap wire or bad connections. Any way for me it ended up in the garbage. CDN should replace these for all who bought one."
1,Defective,Both of these that I received (the original order and then the replacement) were defective. They would not turn on. The battery compartment was almost too small for the AAA battery. I'll try something else now.
2,Poor Quality,"After reading a number of positive reviews of this product, I ordered it. For a time, it worked as described. Then one day, after about 15 uses, it simply failed. It registers a temperature of 234F when it is cold to the touch. Changed battery...no difference. Cheap Chinese junk. Simply a waste of money."
1,I used the CDN to monitor a large tri-tip teak on the Barbecue grill it lasted just a moments,The first time I used the digital Thermometer the probe wire rested on the grill surface much to my dismay and was destroyed.When I closed the barbecue lid the wire slack must have changed and the wire touched the grill and was fried.
1,Questionable,"First let me say a friend has this a loves it. My first time using it I got an error message of PP and sometimes LL but when calling the company no one knew what the codes meant. They sent me another probe at no charge. I used it one time without problems but ever since then the same error comes up. I will purchase another, I have let the time between orders lapse, and see if the problem is the unit itself. I want to love this as much as my friend does"
3,Alarm not loud enough. Cord should be a little longer. Can't put probe all the way in liquid.,"The alarm is not loud enough. Cord is a little short. And the probe, I can not put in liquit. I think liquid is getting into the probe when submerged. The cord is just long enough to set on the stove from what ever you are doing, but stove gets warm to hot, unit is made of plastic. I want to put the lid on the pot, so I put probe into the liquid. Some time later I was getting flashing and bad temp. I changed the probe and kept it out of the liquid and started getting the right temp. You have to be in the same room and not make to much noise to hear the alarm. So if you stand over what you are doing and don't let liquid get around the probe head where the wire goes in, you will be OK."
2,Worked well--twice.,"After reading other reviews I was very careful not to pinch the probe sensor's wire or put any strain on it. I ran my sensor through a vent hole on my upright water smoker, which worked great two times. The third time I tried to use it the display shows an error, and nothing I have tried has worked.I guess it's a lesson learned. Now I need to find another one to replace this one."
5,Heaven Sent,I bought my thermometer about a year ago and have used it to cook beef and chicken to perfection. No more dry meat whether it is in the oven or in a smoker or grill. Then I tried it to make fudge. Best fudge I've ever made and the temperatures were very accurate. Plan on buying one for each of my children for Christmas.
2,Time to Check the Warranty,"The thermometer looks really good at first. Great range for candy making (unlike one of the more inexpensive models that Amazon sells) and reasonable wire length. For the past two months its been great. Then it suddenly gave poor measurements (based on salt free ice water, fully equilibrated, and salt free boiling water). It is approx 25 degrees below what it should read. So I'm sending it back. The unit comes with a 5 year warranty. We'll see what type of response I get.Update: ended up getting a warranty replacement. This too worked for a while and then failed. Stay away"
1,Not reliable,"I had the exact same experience as B. Davis. Once again the thermometer worked great for a few months, then suddenly it went in the opposite direction with an over-read of about 30 degrees, ruining a batch of caramels. The next time I used it was with beef, and by touch I knew I had a thermometer problem. I checked it with two other thermometers and the difference against both of them was 28 degrees. I hope to get a replacement on warranty, but certainly don't believe it will hold up. Not having faith in your thermometer is worse than not having a thermometer at all. Stay away."
5,This model is terrific!,"I and my professional barbecue team partners have been using three of these units (same model)for a year and a half, with no problems and usage of an average of 45 events per year/40 tests per event. Just use average, sensible care and they work well. I suspect that some of the users who rate these poorly do not have experience and the sense to utilize them the way they are intended. A fine product for the money. Even if I got a year out of each of them, they would be an accurate bargain."
1,Cheap POS,"After a couple of uses it doesn't give accurate temp readings. It's cheap Chinese plastic. A typical disposable electronic device. Also, the ""Beef, poultry,..."" settings are useless. Instead of these extra settings they should have invested in a better sensor. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Bad product - still the best I found!,"First, I don't like this thermometer. The build is way cheap, feels flimsy, and the user interface (firmware) is just awful. Really.However, it's the only one I found that can handle the temperature I use when I bake some of my breads (500F).Summary: Not good, but actually the best since it's the only option (if you need the temperature range)."
1,Unreliable,"Bought two based on reviews. ( one for vacation home). Tried it out on Christmas dinner ( beef filet).Cooked filet on BBQ. Marked the meat and then moved to side to finish with indirect heat. I placed the probe and set the alarm for "" beef rare 140"". It immediately went to 140 and sounded the alarm. I knew it was wrong but I checked it with my trusty old instatherm. It was only 120. I repositioned the probe several times. Same result. Never bothered to check it for calibration. I don,t think you can calibrate it. I sent them both back. Will have to look for something else."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the thermometer. I put it in the thickest part of my turkey breast and the temperature started to rise quite quickly. The thermometer said my turkey had reached the desired temperature about an hour and a half before the per pound time suggested. I saw no pink juices so I assumed it was correct - took the turkey out of the oven to rest for 30 minutes, started to slice and it was not done. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Worked for one pork butt,"Item worked perfectly for a smoking a pork butt on my Weber kettle grill. However, the next time I plugged in the probe and turned on the unit, it said the air temperature was 140F. I then held onto the probe, and watched the temperature rise to 150F.My quest continues to find a good meat thermometer for slow cooking on the grill."
3,"Works Fine, Clip didn't fit","For checking the temp, it works fine and the on/off button I really appreciate.However, the clip to attach it to the side of a pan doesn't fit - which was one of my ""must haves"" in shopping for a new thermometer. Very unhappy about that."
2,Great - if you stay in the same room,"I really wanted to like this. Price was right and it was easy to set up and start to use. Liked the pre-set temps for various types of meat (with the ability to adjust as necessary). Unfortunately, I seriously dried out dinner the first time I tried to use it. The alarm was so quiet that unless you were in the same room you'd never hear it. It's on it's way back."
3,good.,I have this one over a year.It works but the timer function is need to be redesigned. (missing Second display : not good to set the timer for grilling steaks).
1,Overcooking required/unreliable,"The CDN thermometer does not allow one to program the temperature that one is seeking. The forced presets are all overcooked. For example ""rare"" beef is 145F. This is at least 10F too high and after a 30 minute rest before carving the meat will be well done plus. Similarly a 185F chicken breast wouldn't be worth eating. The thermometer is initially accurate enough, but it has not proved to be durable. I do not recommend this product for any purpose."
1,2nd one broken,!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!!!!!I have ordered two of these. I thought the first one might have gotten wet or something. The second developed the same issue with in an even shorter period of time. I was very careful to take care of it. I recommend you do not purchase this item.I'm looking for a better replacement right now.
3,No complaints yet,"So far so good, works well in my oven. Probe did get stuck on oven roof, though that was probably my bad.Does not automatically come set to sound an alarm, so checking that first is probably good."
1,What a piece of junk!!!!,I had this item in a wish list for approximately 9 months and finally got it for a Christmas present. I took it out of the package and tried to use it to cook Christmas dinner. This piece of junk did not even try to work. I spent 30 minutes trying to get the probe to register any temperature at all and the only time it worked momentarily was when I took it out of the meat. DON'T BUY THIS ---- IT IS GARBAGE!!!!!
2,Returned!,When you use the temperature alarm the unit gets stuck in alarm mode and won't exit even if you remove the battery and reboot.
2,"Work for a while, broke prematurely","This worked as it should for a while. After using this less than 10 times within the first year of use, it quit working. It now reads a temperature of around 160 when at room temperature."
1,Cannot Hear The Alarm,"I have used the Taylor Temperature probe for many successful holidays until it gave up the ghost this past Thanksgiving. I decided to try the CDN Digital Programmable Probe Thermometer this time which I found on Amazon. While the thermometer may work just fine, you cannot hear the alarm unless you are standing right at the oven. And then, why would you need a probe at all? Most holidays have people around, music and TV on, and the alarm needs to be loud and persistent in order to hear it above the din of the holiday. This one is not loud enough.I am sending this back and going back to the trust Taylor probe thermometer"
3,Nice thermometer - while it worked,"I bought this thermometer a bit over 4 months ago. I just adored it. It was very accurate and I liked that you could change the meat settings on it and really customize it.I gave it 3 stars because its already broken :(I have no idea what happened. It still turns on but now it stays in the temperatures of 147F to 154F (when not even in meat). I never put it in water or dishwasher so I am just clueless as to what is wrong with it. (I changed the batteries, let it reset and all that good stuff). I typically cleaned it off with a damp cloth.Now I need a new one. Not sure if I will buy the same thing. I really did like this one but if its only going to last 4-5 months its not really a good buy."
2,should have returned it,"and may still if we ever dig out from this east coast snow storm.Long story short, from the very first use it's registering about twenty degrees low (based on two old analog thermometer's readings). I figure I can do some tests to see how off it is at different ranges, and as long as it's consistent it will still do the job.If it were accurate these would be the pros:Easy to useNice thick probe wire.Large easily seen readout.Great range, which is what convinced me to give it a try. 32-482!And the cons...not including the inaccuracy:The included magnet (which is a great idea) isn't even strong enough to hold itself on the refrigerator...much less a couple of ounces of plastic.Silly method for telling it what temperature it's looking for.It seems that no probe style thermometer is perfect. This isn't rocket science...what's the problem manufacturers?"
2,Worked well for about an hour,"I liked it well enough but, like another reviewer here, I was using it to monitor a beer mash (water and barley at about 153deg.F)and it gave out after less than an hour. Without changing anything, the temperature suddenly went from 153 to 280. It read the air temp as 210. Kudos to Amazon for a very easy return procedure. I'll give the thermometer one more chance, but next time it is a refund for me."
4,Great Little Gadget - Less Than Intuitive Operation,"I got this a few months ago and I absolutely love it. It takes all the guess work out of cooking roasts. It's also replaced my egg-timer as my primary kitchen timer. The alarm is loud and constant; I have no problem hearing it from anywhere in my (admittedly not very big) home. I also love the fact that it has both a flip-out stand for putting it on the counter, and a magnet for sticking it to the fridge (or anything else suitably stickable).My one complaint is that learning to use the thing took a little while. The buttons and controls are less than intuitive. Switching between modes, making sure the alarm is set, and getting it to let you set specific temperatures (rather than sticking to the FDA-approved meat doneness settings), all take a little finagling. If you're relatively gadget-savvy it probably won't be an issue. But if you're buying it for your grandma, maybe look for another brand."
1,Worked for Three Weeks,"Liked this unit when I bought it, but the fifth time I used it, it read the ambient temperature as 120 degrees when I took it out of the drawers. I live in Alaska; the aforementioned day was all of 65 degrees. With e-coli and heaven knows what else flying around the world, a good cook needs straight data, not electronics having hallucinations.When I called for help the customer service number listed in the instruction pamphlet, I got a 'directory service' voice-mail offering redirection for $4.95. This, to me, smacks of a scam. The number is 800 338-5594. IT'S toll-free...dial it before you buy.Don't buy this. It works great the first four times, but, if it is intended to be disposable, that should be included in the product description.Again, DON'T BUY THIS. No customer support, no recourse when it fails.MAB"
5,Working fine here,"I see a few complaints,In my experience treat the probe line with respect,dont kink or pull it and should work fine as mine has.At least hope so,been good to me."
1,tone too low,"It does everything that was advertised, but I couldn't hear the alarm from the other room and the magnet didn't hold it in place either."
5,Love your food,"Love your food, love your CDN probe thermometer, have your food the way you like it and should be prepare to perfection.PS. purchasing a spare probe to be prepared as well as my meat is."
5,Exciting...,Every piece on this CD is beautiful and truly sparks the imagination. (The composer and music should be considered for films!)
3,Pretty Good Live Set,Keith Sweat was able to take His Style of Singing&Carve out a Good SOlid Run.I enjoyed His First Album the Best overall&His Best Songs here are those Hits that are still the Cuts.I give Him Props for Surviving the New Jack Swing Era.
1,Too Sensitive!,"I cant make toast,I cant pre-heat my oven,I cant boil water,I cant walk by it if I'm sweating.EVERYTHING sets off this damn thing, and its on the other side of my kitchen from my toaster and stove.I hate it! It cannot tell the difference between combustible particles and a hole in the ground."
2,way too sensitive,"Have to agree with the earlier post. We have this same alarm in the kitchen, and it goes off just about every time we bake or fry anything. The ""hush"" feature doesn't help enough with this problem. When the thing is going off (again), we push the ""hush"" button, and the alarm just chirps a little for about 10 minutes, but then it starts back up with the full-on alarm sound. This cycle continues until cooking is completely finished and kitchen is aired out 10 minutes, or we take the battery out, which is counter to the idea of even having a smoke alarm to begin with....."
4,The Journey of a Lifetime.,"That's how the author's vacation to England was described. I like books I can savor because they are full of details that draw me into the experience of the author. I also like books that I can read in one sitting. Ms. Carsey wrote me the perfect book. I laughed, I cried, my heart pounded with her adventure. I was looking out the van window with her seeing the ""green squares ......(of English countryside).... decorated with cows or sheep."" Her writing is a delight. There's even a bit of magic in it."
5,AWESOME KIDS BOOK!!!,"This is a wonderful kids book! The story is so creative and fun. The pictures are so vivid, beautiful and captivating...I am still reading it to my kids every night (it's now February) because they love it so much"
3,Cute but no replacement for the Christmas classics,"Snowmen at Christmas is a cute book. The illustrations are creative and colorful. I found the text, in rhyme, trite and sounding a bit too much in format like ""The Night Before Christmas."" My 6-year old was not interested and my 3-year old was mildly curious about the stroyline. I would have rather borrowed from the library."
5,Fun book,"This is a such a fun book, the whole idea is so cute. For added fun the author added small things to every page for children to find."
5,"When will the authors learn to use the correct name, Hmong?","We are not meo, stupid....we were Hmong, have been Hmong for 10,000 years... and will always be Hmong...the authors are ignorant, scumbags..."
3,Not so good,"The book arrived 2 weeks earlier than the proposed date. However, the book came dented on the front cover. Luckily the book is still useable and readable."
1,"Why make it easy, when you can have it complicated?","I'm somewhat familiar with the terms, but this author is so obsessed with makingit all sound and be more complicated then it needs to be that it makes readingthis otherwise (short) book Gitmo-style. It's all so pretentious and unnnecessarilycomplicated, when the majority of the subject could be explained quick and painlesslyin a ""normal"" English. I would not be reading it if I didn't have to graduate (and I think Iwould not read it if I was getting paid for it either...)"
2,review,"arrived really fast. the cover had been taped back on and all of the pages were falling out, which i do not consider to be good or acceptable condition."
1,Look elsewhere for concise information without the wordiness,"For those individuals who have a passion for cognitive psychology and its technical language, this is the book for you. As for the remainder, look elsewhere if you want an introductory text or if you desire concrete examples related to theoretical assertions. This text is intended for those who possess in-depth knowledge of cognitive functions and experimentation and excludes background information."
2,"Large Quantity, Poor Quality",It is quite clear that the author is an engineer with a broad knowledge of very shallow depth. Just read Chapter 2 on Fourier Transforms and Chapter 4 on Probability. I do understand these two areas very well and I can tell you that the presentation is below mediocre.
2,not worth the price,"This text was DEFINTELY written for professors as many fine details were omitted or skipped. As an undergraduate text, it made communication systems more dificult to understand. The concepts of analog communications were briefly covered with many other gravitated garbage included in the preceding chapters. I suggest a MAJOR revision for future editions, then it may be worth the price."
2,Definitely not the best,"First, you really need to have prior exposure to the subject to thoroughly understand some of the topics involved. Some equations are introduced 'ad hoc' and are not explained, even intuitively. If you want to know the 'why' and 'how', look to other books such as Lathi's and Proakis's, which are much better. I found their books to be more systematic, more organized, and simply more logical. Our professors at my university do not seem to like this book, and the students now know why. We switched to Communication Systems Engineering by Proakis, which is more mathematically sound and much clearer. However, you can gain some useful insights from Haykin's book, so I give it two stars instead of one because everything in Haykin's book cannot necessarily be found elsewhere, so it is of use at times."
4,"Good Product, but not the Best","I'm using this book for my classes and sometimes the material seems to be out of order (as in, certain chapters would be better in different areas) but it is otherwise a very good book and describes the material better than my teacher. I like that it does so in such a small number of pages, but I think some topics needed a bit more explanation."
4,"Good reference for experienced staff, but not for beginners","This wasn't quite what I was expecting when I ordered it. It isn't so much a book as a very detailed outline. There isn't a great deal of supporting text, mostly just lists of things that need to be accomplished and who is responsible for their completion. This is a very good reference for someone who has had experience in search and rescue, but I wouldn't recommend it for a novice looking to understand how the IC system works. Also, I wouldn't quite call this a paperback book; more like a booklet."
4,Good text,"This book is recommended for my ""Gene Manipulation and DNA Analysis"" course. I think the book is very helpful as a tool for learning about gene manipulation. No doubt anyone who is learning this topic should be taking a class at the same time as the information provided in this book is fairly dense and can be confusing. With that said, this book provides great illustrations which aid in the learning process. I totally recommend it."
5,Glass scrubber does glass good,I have been using this product for a few years now but local stores have stopped carrying it. This product gets glass so clean water slides off windows BUT: I use Glass Scrubber then RainX (reg old style) over it and water slides off in sheets. When rain stops and car dries off windows do NOT have any spots either!!!Thanks
3,Nothing special,Used the scrub and it did a reasonable job but nothing to rave about. I have found other products have worked just as well and cost less.
1,"Art of Love, Not Very Loving","I have a better title for this album. It should be called ""Art of Death"". The songs are moody,dark, and just plain boreing. Having said that, I will also say that Sandra has recorded some excellent pop masterpieces throughout the years. All of her previous albums contained very melodic,entertaining songs in a kind of europop format. This is her first new album in a while and while she still sounds great vocally, the songs are not very good."
5,As good as it can be,"I have two of these, one for each of my Ducanes. They're heavy and well made and well-fitting. They have withstood several windy Colorado winters and are still in like-new shape. They do the job and I can't think how you could design one or manufacture one better."
5,"DUCANE Gas Grill Cover -- 'A steal for the money""","The 'cost to value"" rating for this gas grill cover is 4.0! The quality of the naugahide + the soft inner liner + the velco straps and fit was exceptional. Those cheap silver gas grill covers you buy at Lowes / Home depot are not close when it comes to quality and value. My original DUCANE gas grill cover B4 WEBBER bought them out was over a $100.00 for the exact same quality cover. BEST BUY !!!"
3,ALL RIGHT,"I GOT IT FROM A WEBSITE AND THE SONGS ON THERE IS ALL RIGHT..... SOME SONGS I DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH SO I GAVE IT A 3 STAR.....I'D SUGGEST IT IF YOU ENJOY ALL KINDS OF MUSIC, BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN ABOVE AVERAGE QUALITY...... THINK FOR 2 MORE SECONDS....HOPE THIS HELPED!"
1,DVD Trouble,"I am very sorry to report troubles with this DVD. The encoding is not up to par, causing serious jerkiness, and the interview stops dead in its tracks about 15 minutes into the film.I have never had any problems with other DVDs, and am very dissapointed that this one was so bad. From what little I heard of the interview, it seemed to have been very good."
4,Great Insight,"This resource is a treasure for anyone who is a fan of the cinema, especially, Hitchcock and his technique. A definite must-have for your collection."
1,Misleading web site,"Your web site led me to believe I had to order this as a separate item, when, in fact, it comes with the other kit. I had unpacked and installed this connector before opening the other package, and I see that it was a big waste of my money."
5,This Wonderful Book,"The European Folktale is such an old tome and is SO succinct and creative and wise that I got lost in Luthi's world view. He 'is' simply the best in Folklore Studies, and that's truth...."
4,Good game for kids,"My kids love this game,they love to play it with there friends,and the game is four players,can't beat that."
3,Disappointing!,"Young Pippa is in Venice with the Midlands City Ballet, as their youngest recruit. She meets a handsome young gondolier and through him, befriends a marchesa. She also catches the eye of ballet mistress Angaharad who unfortunately has more of a lecherous interest in our innocent 17-year-old. However, it is a mere blemish in the life of this rising star, who finds herself taking on a principal role in the ballet (Now I may not know much about the ballet world but going from the corps to soloist to a principal's part in just a fortnight seems a bit much to me!) and fronting the band of her darling gondolier, which catches the attention of an American businessman who wants them to sign a contract with him! Can anything better happen to Pippa? A marriage proposal from a prince would be the icing on the cake. Of course that would be taking this story just that little bit too far...! Eye rolls a plenty!"
3,"as a fantasy, maybe; as reality never","This book, if viewed as a fairy tale with a travelogue of the best things to see and do in Venice thrown in, is entertaining to read. As a story, it is ridiculous. No one could be so beautiful and desirable to people of both sexes, so good and innocent, so charming to the local nobility, so talented a dancer that she immediately shoots from the back of the corps to a principal role, so talented a singer that she becomes an overnght success and is offered a $100,000 contract--all without doing much work to get there. And to call this a children's story is not too accurate--young adult maybe, but it contains a same-sex attempted assault and a dishonest affair on the part of Nicolo. I dont know how much Godden knows about ballet and what hard work it is, and how few people do make it, some only after many years. This book just does not ring true and this author has written better stories (e.g., The Peacock Spring)."
2,A bit of fluff...,...from a writer that has done far better work. Goes to show you that maybe writers should just loaf (or take a paying job) when they have nothing much to say. The attempted rape of the young girl dancer by the older dance mistress has the ring of truth for anyone who has suffered sexual abuse. That episode contrasts with the mostly mindless fantasy of the rest of the book. Does it deserve two stars? nah Read Greengage Summer or This House of Brede instead.
1,Misleading photo / different item sent / returned for credit,"Misleading photo, item sent was not same as photo, the net does not go all around the noodle, the ones sent had elastic straps that go around noodle and they slip off. False advertising, items returned for credit. Credit has not been received yet. I won't make puchased from amazon again if this is not corrected."
1,no for me,"I was a little disappointed. This was not for me, but a child would probably enjoy it. We will just use it in the pool for children who visit."
5,Noodle Chair,"We purchased the noodle chair online after unsuccessfully trying to find the product locally. We did find a cheaper, less comfortable version in Wal Mart and pool stores but this design is more comfortable and the noodle does not become detached like in the cheaper version. I would highly recommend this product, we bought two and put one away for future seasons. Nice product."
3,noodle review,I like the idea but the noodle chair did no hold me up without a lot of stress and stain. But trying to stay afloat was all the fun. I actually had to hold on to another noodle for more stability. It was fun trying. However I did end up having to buy a better pool chair. Try it for fun.
1,Don't waste your money.,Might be the worst pool float I've ever owned. You are much better just using the noodle. For $11...you get what you pay for...just wish I would've taken that advice.
2,Need modification,"For the price this noodle chair is ok, I weigh 125 and had a difficult time staying afloat. This chair will only accommodate the thin noodles. There are better models out there that will accommodate two noodles, one for the back and one for the legs. If you want a relaxing time in the pool look for the latter, if you're looking for a quick dip and you don't weigh much than this product will do."
1,Enjoyed it for a week before it tore,"I ordered two nets to go on my 2 noodles for my pool. I used them about 4 times over a one week period. This weekend, my guests and I were in the pool when I noticed the black nylon strap closest to the end of the noodle had torn off. Frustrating. I don't have children and did not misuse this item."
3,Pool chair,"Not a bad pool chair but you have to provide the noodle which isn't too bad.It won't hold me up but that's my fault,"
3,Need a large noodle.,"If you weigh over 150, these will keep you floating, but not above water. It requires a bigger noodle than can fit in the track. The kids love it."
5,Made in America is great,"We had purchased 2 of these noodle chairs years ago and all who swim at our pool love them and want them. We just puchased 8 more for family and friends. There are other noodle chairs on the market, but these are the best and so well made - Made in America!!"
1,Trying to return and company won't respond,I bought three of these and I am trying to return them as they arrived after our vacation. Can NOT get company to respond to my emails as to how to return them. NOT happy with service.
5,Good quality,"I have a similar item I purchased for about half the price at WalMart. The WalMart item is OK, but this is much better quality and worth the extra cost."
2,Have a big butt? Forget it!,"You must be a tiny adult to be able to fit in this thing and not sink to the bottom. I bought one for myself, and I admit. I do have a rather large rear end. The noodle came separately. It lacks support for big butts. If you have a wide one, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be able to fit in this thing. I wish someone would have told me it for kids."
2,Child's Chair,The picture is very decieving. You can't use large noodles because the opening will only take a small noodle. So there is no way it will hold up an adult. It barely holds up my 6 year old grandaughter! But she likes playing with it anyway.
3,Ok...,This item should include the noodle for the price! It seems to be made well but I would rather it be more bouyant.
3,Doesn't float very well,"I bought this float two weeks ago to take on vacation with my family. We put the noodle inside it just fine. When we put it in the water, it didn't even hold up my 130 pound daughter! I bought two and feel like I wasted my money."
3,Not a toy,"These are floating devised for pools not toys. Children should not be allowed to use this without supervisor. They couldget there heads stuck in the webbing of the chair. As for adults, other than the difficulty of treading the noodle throughthe holes, this is a great product."
1,"Just a net,no noodle,not worth it!","This chair is a joke,it is really just a net that you insert noodles in,(Make sure you buy a large noodle otherwise unless you are 100 lbs you will be underwater!) Price for this is way too much!!Buy a net raft,it is so much better! Take a look at [...].Don't waste your money on this,they are not worth it.I purchased three of them and no one is using them.Everyone wants the net rafts and you don't have to buy noodles too!Someone is making a lot of money on a product that is nothing more then a net,just like a sack of onions comes in,for [$...]!!lol.There is nothing amazing about this..... but the price!!"
4,A Great Upgrade over the Flimsy OEM Tripod,"I still find it hard to believe I was able to purchase a tripod of this quality for the money I spent. This tripod is about a 1000% improvement over the flimsy tripod that came originally with my orange tube Celestron C8. The telescope is now stable, much more enjoyable to use, and no longer looks like a child's toy.Two problems: (1) The first tripod shipped arrived damaged in transit. Amazon handled the exchange seamlessly. (2) One of the slotted holes that accept the screws that attach the motor drive to the tripod was cast slightly narrow. I had to file quite a bit of metal to get the screw to go in. This is a Q.C. problem, and should not have been something I had to deal with. Had I bought it locally, I would have carted it back to the dealer for him to address."
2,Disappointing quality,"I so dislike writing negative reviews, but maybe this will help someone, and perhaps save the planet from more needless shipping round trips, so here goes...It's hard to tell if it's just the donabe, or if it just looks worse because it was wrapped in color newsprint (it was well packaged for shipping with peanuts, etc., though, after the newsprint)...but much of it seems to be the item itself. The pot in the picture looks like it was made with care and would be a fine serving piece (in addition to cookware). The one I received looks like it was made in a hurry. :("
5,Top notch digital recorder,"This is one of the lightest, slimmest, recorders on the market. I have carried and used various recorders for the past two years and this is by far the best yet. Clarity is excellent and volume control is easy. Dictation/transciption has never been easier."
3,"Good, but software lacks Win2K support","On the whole, I am quite pleased with this recorder. The sound quality is good and it fits comfortably in the palm of your hand.The controls require some attention to operate as they are small and closely spaced.You need to read the manual carefully to understand how the system operates, but once this is done using the recorder seems straightforward enough.The unit I received includes IBM Viavoice Millennium version 7 voice recognition software. One small problem: Windows 2000 is not supported, and the software does not work on my Windows 2000 system. (Windows 2000 is only officially supported by IBM Viavoice Millennium version 8, Professional edition.)One thing I would like included is a small carry case to protect the unit. It does come with a carry strap."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased the DS-150 about 4 months ago and have not been satisfied with the product.The recording and playback quality is poor and the voice recognition software accompanied with the product is extremely hard to set-up correctly and use.Save your money and buy a standard tape driven recorder!
5,HOTT TO DEATH!,I bought this album back in the 90's when it was first released because it is produced by Walter Becker of Steely Dan. I am a big fan of Steely so I just figured it would be good. I was right. This album is a must buy for all dedicated fusion fans! THIS IS HOTT!
4,"Great product, but could use a tweak to be better","I think this is a very good product at a great price, but it doesn't work on all my chinrests. I have a few vintage chinrests that cannot be adjusted with this tool. I think it would be nice if the tip were tapered to fit into some of the older chinrests with smaller holes. Just a thought..."
5,great vcr,"This was such a great vcr/dvd combo! I got mine about 3 or 4 years ago and never had a problem with it. It is actually able to record your dvd onto vhs tape which is what I loved most about this unit. But it accidentally fell off my dresser onto the floor and now it won't work, and of course they don't make this unit anymore. I was told it's cheaper to just buy a new one which really sucks! Especially since this unit was a dream to operate. I would recommend GoVideo products, now I have to start my search for the perfect unit all over again!"
4,"Good text, odd pictures","This book is a basic but comprehensive and unbiased introduction to various aspects of Jewish religion, culture, and history. It explains concepts in an approachable and interesting way, with useful textbook-like call-outs. There are several other books that I'd be more likely to recommend for someone looking for a good introduction to Judaism, but there's nothing wrong with this one. However, I have no idea what the person who chose the photographs was smoking. To start with, they are rather dated, even more so than you'd expect for something that was written in 1984. And they also often have only a tenuous connection to the concept that page or paragraph is discussing. To give an example, Jews, evidently, await the coming of the Messiah in small round boxes! ;-)"
3,"Book is Educational, But Dry","I'm reading this book for my Judaica 182 class at UCI. This book is educational, but dry."
1,The Worst Time Travel Film Ever Made!,"If someone was firing a machine gun at you just several yards away, would you just stand there firing a revolver, in return? Most folks with common sense realize doing something so ridiculous will get you cut to ribbons! But not the filmmakers of Slipstream! I could not believe my eyes! And this was portrayed over and over again, ad nauseum! Memo to Hollywood: Machine gun wins over pistol, not the other way around. When being shot at make sure you have some sort of cover, too! Wow, did the filmmakers ever bother to take any courses in physics while they were in High School? I guess not!Nor was there a single character I could empathize with! In fact, the story's hero was so shallow and obnoxious, it ruined any fun one could possibly get from viewing this dull, plodding, two-dimentional piece of trash!"
4,"Light on the script, but fairly good any how...",I always expect a good movie and good acting....not often get both. Still liked it...
4,Slipstream,"I give it 3 1/2 stars. I enjoy time travel, jump, et cetera type movies. This one is similar to a couple others that involve a limited time slot for backing up time. The cast and story is decent. It revolves around a physicist and a device from the lab where he works and his plot to rob a bank. When a group of robbers come in before he can rob the bank, everything gets crazy and he uses his device to try to fix things that happen. As the story progresses people die and everyone has regrets about how things turned out. By the end of the movie everyone changes their atttitude on what they would do including the robbers. I found it entertaining enough to want to get a copy. Some known actors including Sean Astin, Tamsin MacCarthy (II), and Chantal Lambert make the acting worthwhile. Good quality DVD with limited extras. Decent replayability if you enjoy time travel and gangster movies movies like12:01andSnatch (Widescreen Edition).CA Luster"
3,Read the directions and this camera might work for you !!!!!!!,"Be careful with this camera and maybe you won't destroy a couple of days of pictures....1- Rewind the camera before opening the camera to change film. I was in a hurry and didn't realize in the loud environment that I didn't hear it rewind. So I opened the camera to change film and ruined days of pix. This camera is from the Stone Age...no bells or whistles...or auto advance, auto rewind.2- Check the O-Ring for flexibility, cleanliness, and form (round cross- section not D-ring).3- Don't go too deep in the water.Now after my screwing it up I'd give it the full 5 stars..LEARN from MY mistakes and you will too.ENJOY!"
2,"Some facts are well explained, but...","I am very interested in Horse Color Genetics and have read quite a bit on the subject. As a Paint breeder however, I am not very happy with this book. I feel Gower has stated her opinion to much. She makes too many statements that are pure ""taste"" and not fact. Especially when it comes to Blue eyes, mixing Paint patterns and cremello's. Other than that she does explain very well."
2,Decent Start,"It's a good place to start, but it could be a lot better. She devotes a bare chapter on champagne, yet completely skips over the single dilute smoky black (black with one cream gene, which she calls smoky buckskin).She mentions in a couple of paragraphs about double dilutes (cremello, perlino and 'smokey perlino' *which is actually smoky cream aka black with 2 cream genes).She devotes quite a bit of time to talking about how to get a liver chestnut etc, but those genes aren't completely understood even at this point, and it's extremely hard to breed for a specific shade of anything.She should have used better pictures, as several of the pictures were of unkempt, ungroomed horses.Overall, it's a decent start for a beginner."
3,A good book with limited distribution,I am an author and often need information like this book provides.It is well presented and had a wealth of horse breeding information.
3,Good for beginners,"This is a good beginner guide to equine color genetics. If you do not have any background in color breeding, this is an excellent place to start. I do think that they leave out some technical information that is very relevant and important for in-depth study, but if you are a recreational horse owner interested in experimenting with color breeding, you will find everything you need in this book. On the other hand, if you are a geneticist, research scientist, horse breeder, or have extensive knowledge about genetics and breeding, this book is a bit too basic for your needs. A fun, informative, and casual read for recreational horse owners/breeders; not recommended for scientists or professional breeders."
2,"i don't know, but this doesn't smell like summer to me","granted, i haven't experienced summer everywhere so i can't say that this doesn't smell like summer anywhere....i just haven't been to a place that smelled like fruity bubble gum. not my first choice for an air freshener. scent is okay, but yeh, not what i expected."
4,"Have had for 2 months, so far so good",I got this for my line 6 g50 cuz Iv already gone through 3 from line 6 in a year. I'm not hard on the chords either but line 6 kept dying on me. This Chord has worked perfectly so far.
5,"Great cable, especially for a Line 6 G50",Picked this up because I prefer using a right-angle plug on my bass. Works flawlessly with my Line 6 G50.
1,Not so hot,I bought this as a replacement for teh original that shorted out...well this one was worse brand new than the original that shorted out. So i had to open and resoder the original and wasted $20 on this piece of crap. Save yourself some money and don't buy this. It was junk.
5,Funnier than the SF-Cons she parodies!,"I was immersed in the fannish lifestyle while in high school, and know people still in it. This is SO accurate of many of the people you see there, and like the author's comments say, I DID recognize people in the book that could have been from real life. Loved it loved it loved it! I like a large range of mysteries, but ones that can make me laugh at the same time are my favorites. I plan on reading the sequel."
2,"Good SF conventionhandbook, but nothing else.","The blurb for this book... and the reviews here... correctly state that this book is a good handbook for the overall ""feel"" of a science fiction fan convention.Beyond that, however, the reviews depart from reality. I was expecting a good murder mystery wrapped in tightly written, funny sci-fi insider jokes. I got a grammatically correct novel with weak, unengaging characterizations, unworkable murder plot & plot resolution, and only a very, very thin scattering of humor aimed at things only sci-fi insiders would understand.This book was written for the sci-fi OUTSIDER, laughing WITH the outsider, not embracing the insider fans & trade.So, if you're a sci-fi fan, or looking for an engaging murder mystery, then look elsewhere."
5,Totally awesome!,"Strangely enough, I read Zombies of the Gene Pool first. I was totally entranced by the fandom, the con, all the SF believers and followers. I'm not an SF fan, I'm a mystery buff. This covered both at the same time in such a way that I now want the whole world to read both books. Well done, Sharyn McCrumb..to me still the best mystery author ever!"
2,Uninspired and bland,"This book is the literary equivalent of ""Diagnosis Murder"" or ""Murder She Wrote"". The characters are one dimensional and not quite believable, especially the con goers.It is interesting that the book is so dated. For example, one of the characters talks about how he leaves messages in a file on a server at the University where the person he is sending the message to can log on and read it. In the 11 years since the book was written email has become so much a part of life that the whole talk sounds like Mr. Burns on the Simpsons raving about ""this so-called iced cream"".I was also unimpressed with the author's humorous timing. There were a couple of genuine chuckles in the book but there were several places where a funny gag is ruined because the author grinds it into the ground by spelling out the humor for us in detail.All in all a pretty disappointing and forgettable read."
2,"Jacquiline Kirby, You Have Nothing To Worry About!","I bought this book ( on Kindle ) because a reviewer or two had compared it as a spoof to Elizabeth Peters' book DIE FOR LOVE, which I found hilarious. I am also an avid SF and Fantasy reader, and aTrekker, even though I have never been to a ""Con."" Thougbht there would be plenty I'd recognize and enjoy. There was't. Not only didn't I laugh out loud, there was not even a gigglee. The Star Trek wedding was mildly amusing, as was some of the fan geekdom, but the mystery was so transparent that I was able to pick out the murderer before the murder was committed, despite the fact that my Kindle version lacked the back flap or blurb or whatever it was that other readers said gave them their clue to the murderer's identity! Jacquiline Kirby, you have nothing to worry about!"
1,I didn't laugh until I hurt.,"I hated this book. SM has some serious hang-ups to overcome, because everything she said about fandom, while true, was in the worst possible light at the most extreme. Her consistent haranguing about obesity, her complete disrespect for both fans and authors, her extremely negative mentions of homosexuality and, moreover, the plot that I solved BEFORE the murder was committed (and I am singularly awful at solving plots) made this the worst book I have read in ages.Watch you some Galaxy Quest, Sharyn McCrumb, and get over your bitterness. Whatever fandom did to you, move on."
3,Satirical Sci-Fi for D&D Geeks (Dungeons and Dragons to the non-initiated),"Sharyn McCrumb has hit the proverbial nail on the head with this book/spoof/satire about sci-fi/fantasy conventions for gamers and other-wordly misfits. As one of the few! somewhat normal persons who frequent ""Cons"" as they're called by those in the know, this hilarious romp accentuates what is funniest and also, what is most pathetic about gaming conventions. Ms. McCrumb truly has an eye for detail (or maybe she's just a closet gamer herself). I suspect you'll enjoy this book all the more if you *are* a gamer, in the closet or out of it."
3,INFO,I bought this video not know what was on it or what it was about since no one had reviewed it yet. I hope my review of it will help you out.This is an aprox. one hour long video with step by step instructions of some of the club med dances. They include:(1) Mambo #5(2)Livin' La Vida Loca(3) Tequila Boom Boom(4) Macarena(5) Blame it on the boogie(6) Aloha OE(7) Hands up.After returning from vacation to Sonora Bay I was excited to see a Club Med video with the dances we learned. I only gave it a 3 star review because many of the dances we never did at our club med and I mostly wanted the Hands Up dance and the one on the tape was different then the one we learned. The instructions for the dances was very good. I would recomend it if the songs listed are ones that you are looking for.
3,Lacked A Couple of Essentials,"I only gave this three stars because it did not contain instructions for the Crazy Signs, or for the Aga Dou dance -- two of the essential Club Med terpsichorean staples. Even though the different Club Med villages have different theme songs (Playa Blanca is the best and catchiest), the Crazy Signs are the same everywhere and they warrant some documented instruction. Aga Dou is probably fading away, it has been phased out at several villages (as has the Duck Dance). Playa Blanca was the best, even if the drive from the airport took 75 minutes and the village is very small. We went back in the kitchen one night to watch the cooking crew at work, and it reminded me of the guys shoveling coal into the furnaces in the film ""Titanic"" -- a pure sweat shop."
5,ANOTHER GOOD POSSOM FAMILY BOOK,"Eugene becomes afraid of the dark, which is not really a good trate for possoms. This is a great little book to discuss the fear of darkness, or fear in general with children. The text is quite readable and understandable and fits quite well is the wonderful illustrations by John Larrecq. I enjoy reading this one with the grandchildren and do highly recommend it."
3,Delivers the huge monster,"I couldn't resist a book with a gaping maw on the cover and for the most part this book delivers what a monster fan would want. During any part of the narration you'll get a cut-away to the monster doing what it's good at: being huge and totally messing people and buildings up while doing so in grisly detail.I personally fell that the climax of the story veers in completely the wrong direction, though. It's interesting but departs from the whole appeal of the entire narrative. There's some payoff in the epilogue but I really felt that it belonged in the actual story."
3,Sacagawea's,I Liked this book because it wasn't to hard to read and it didn't tell every single detail it stayed on Sacagawea it didn't like start talking about clark or anything it stayed on her not her baby her.MaryGrace Cruser
4,A Fair Look,"I read this book. As a young person just beginning to vote, I like what I read here and found Clinton to be an intelligent and educated person. I have not been able to find anything written by our current president that compares, but I am still looking. It is easy to see when a republican writes one of these reviews about a democratic author because they don't seem to know how to acknowledge intelligence! But this is an intelligently written book, on it's own merit and I recommend it."
1,Clinton's vision of how he should run your life,"This candy-coated pap (sorry for the mixed metaphor) of Clinton's perscriptions for how he should run our lives deserves a re-read, if for no other reason than to refresh one's memory of the vacuity and hypocrisy it contains. One small example: page 8 talks about those evil Reaganites who made ""paper profits"" in the 1980s. Clinton fails to mention his own paper profits from the bribe, er cattle futures trading, that he received in the 1970s and 1980s. That this man was reelected is a testment to the moral and intellectual limpness of the American people and also to wiliness of a man who I may be disgusted with, but have to admire for his sheer stamina."
1,No English Version?,"I heard this book endorsed by Webster Tarpley so I came here to purchase it. Unfortunately it's in German, not English. Does anyone know if and when there will be an English version?It's a shame something so important (apparently it's a very good book on 911) was published only in German which restricts its readership to a small group rather than the larger audience of English-speaking peoples worldwide."
5,Poor Poe!...,Poor Poe suffered a great deal of personal tragedy. Silverman's account is probably the best current critical bio around.
4,"Ok book, bad for a book report. Too much information.","Though the book is interesting, it often feels dragged out. Often giving too much detail. Though its not a bad read, i would never suggest it for a book report."
3,Great Set,I use this type of set for years. Excellent item to keep in your trunk in case of emergencies. bought a few for family.
4,"sweet ; yet, melodic tones set the stage for listening.","If loaning a cd to a friend,and trying by all conventional means to get this cd returned without success is any indication as to its worth...so be it."
5,Could I Have This Dance?,"I read this series out of order but enjoyed this one the most. But it is worth the time to read all three. Harry Kraus uses real problems and real delimas like abortion, mercy killing, and rape and works it out honestly, not too easy to be true. I especially like the way Dr. Kraus presents romance. You can tell it wasn't written by a woman describing what women wish it was but isn't. I won't say they best books you'll ever read but they are interesting, enjoyable, and there are times you won't want to put it down."
1,Too simple,"If it weren't for the fact that I did finish this book, I would give it zero stars; but it did have enough interest to allow me to make it to the end. I agree with the reviewer who found the characters to be one-dimensional. While, perhaps, the plot itself was not entirely devoid of creative thought, the most disappointing aspect to this book lies in the manner in which the author weaved the influence of God/Christ in the main character's evolution. It seemed that he wrote the book in its entirety then later added a paragraph or sentence here and there to make it a Christian work. Not only are the references to Christianity/faith/God minimal, they are far too simplistic as well. In summary, I read the book but won't be reading its sequels."
4,The full story is told in two novels - not just one.,"Could I Have This Dance? is an interesting book about one woman's willingness to look past childhood hurts to find an answer to a medical mystery. But the full story arc, which takes shape in this book, only reaches resolution in the follow-up novel, For The Rest Of My Life.Why is that important to note? Because the full answers don't come until the second book. You'll finish reading this one and still have questions that can only be answered by the next book. Neat marketing trick, sure, but very frustrating to readers."
4,wonderful book,"I was very drawn into this book.I am not a ""reader"" but wanted something light, educating and interesting and this was it!As I read this book, my sister was in the hospital so I was more drawn into the life of Claire as a resident and found unbelievable Godly interventions. While reading something in the book, my sister happened to be going thru similiar situations.My only discontent was the ending of the story.It was out of place and very strange.I did learn so much about things I knew nothing about (Huntingtons and the life of a new resident )I have strongly recommended the book to many of the nurses I encountered while reading the book.Enjoy!!"
5,TAZ AT HIS BEST!,The first two cartoons on this tape show Taz's debut scaring everyone else except for Bugs Bunny. This tape displays Looney Tunes at it's best. The viewing quality is very clear and sharp. The last few cartoons do not have Taz in them but they are just as good.
2,house rules,"I was unable to finish this book. The problem was that it (to me anyway) lacked sufficient tension. The protagonist seemed to be floating along a scenic river that was going at a comfortable pace toward a destination of his own choosing. Everything fell into place to provide him with the exact experience he sought from the beginning. To me, the protagonist should have some surprises & difficulties along the way, challenges to overcome, life changing decisions to make. The (protagonist) character should undergo some metamorphisis based upon discoveries and the effect of new experiences and reactions to previously unknown sensations. The crossdressing came entirely too easy for him. It should have been devistating to go out in public like that at least for the first time, whether or not he came to like it later. Maybe if I'd finished it, these things would have come about. I may yet pick it up again and give it another chance."
2,Ditto,"The September 19, 2001 reviewer has it exactly right. There is not enough dramatic tension in this book, which I also found to be the case with Scott's Travels with a Whip. How can one write about erotic and unusual sexual practices without them being sexy, or not sexy enough at least? Read these works and see... Though I agree with another reviewer as well, the chastity belt aspect was nicely done."
3,Better than Average,Sean Penn is a Very Talented Artist easily one of the Baddest over the past 15 Years easily.Woody Allen is one of the Baddest Directors Ever but this Film isn't among His Best but still Better than Average.I enjoyed the Guitar Playing&the Way Relationships are Displayed through out.but the Comedy&overall feel of the story never fully develops.still worth checking out for Penn&Morton.
3,Another interesting failure for Woody,"This film starts out well, and is excellent much of the time, particular the scenes with Penn and Samantha Morton (whose performance is Oscar-worthy, but eventually slides back into the same old Woody Allen stick that hasn't really seemed fresh for at least a decade of films. Unless you are a hardcore Allen fan, this movie will probably lose you about halfway through,"
2,Boring as hell,"I rented the movie thinking it was going to be a good movie, boy I was disappointed.I was hoping to hear about the big stars who really knew him.It was more like a third person story. I didn't find the movie to be very appealing or funny. I fell asleep watching the movie to find Sean Penn smashing his guitar. That was the ending. I was hoping to see him get shot or die of a drug overdose. He didnot look like he was playing the guitar. They should have removed the strings and have him lipsynching the songs."
4,A recent masterpiece of oral culture in Woody Allen's movies,"One of the most fantastic thing about Sweet and Lowdown, apart from the brilliant performance of Sean Penn and Samantha Morton, is the representation of oral culture. Woody Allen and several important figures appear in the movie to tell the auidence directly what they think about the brillant guitar player, which leads to a variety of story versions. It makes the life Emmet Ray and the movie more vivid. Oral culture has become a significant icon in Allen's movies, such as Zelig and Broadyway Danny Rose. Allen gives us some insights on how to tell a story and its impact on the liability of the text itself.Though Samantha Morton played a difficult part in the movie as a dumb girl, her voice really comes out, which blends wonderfully with the enjoyable guitar music."
4,another woody gem,another stylistic gem from woody allen getting into a 30s jazz guitar groove with fascinating characters and a quirky storyline. sean penn delivers the goods with an arresting performance as the train loving rat shooting dissolute django rheinhardt wanna be. a beautiful ensemble production that hits all the right notes
5,"Exceptional, A Triumph for Woody!","Sweet and Lowdown is truly a masterpiece, however, I did find it bitter-sweet at times. Sean-Penn is incredible as the ego and cleptomanic Emmett Ray, an exceptional musician on stage and a crude, rude boor off. The juxtaposition between these two personalities is brought out, and very well. the character development by Mr. Allen was perfect. Going to 'da dump ta shoot rat's, and watching trains are his two favorite pastimes, (other than being a womanizer. Samantha Morton as Hattie, a mute, honest, and just plain wonderful person plays perfectly off of Penn's cad-like Emmett Ray. It seemed that she was lifted from a Chaplain classic, and Uma Thurman comes across as a direct parallel to Emmett Ray. As a guiarist and musician, I can tell you that ego's and personalities like Emmett Ray's exist. Five Stars Plus."
3,I liked it better when it was La Strada,"For those who didn't know: ""Stardust Memories"" was Woody's take on ""8 1/2"", ""Celebrity"" seemed to me like ""La Dolce Vita"" and this film seems like ""La Strada."" In my humble opinion, ""La Strada"" was one of the greatest films of all time. So, if you appreciated the sentiment in ""Sweet and Lowdown,"" I recommnend highly its mentor: ""La Strada."" All in all, I prefer Woody when he's original. For instance, ""Annie Hall"", ""Husbands and Wives,"" or am I missing something?"
4,Woody back to basics.,"It's such a shame that Woody Allen's films just aren't opened to the large audiences anymore. Sweet and Lowdown, Allen's latest comedic invention, is a film that seems to go back to style of comedic farce and character study that Woody took on in his first major films. At times a mock documentary in the vein of ""Take the Money and Run"" and ""Zelig"", Sweet and Lowdown is a more mature film that has a lot more notes to it than the early movies. This film also features something that no other Allen film has had - a truly transformative performance from an actor. Sean Penn and Allen paint such a quircky and complex character that I actually left the theatre thinking Emmitt Ray must have been a real person. Surely no filmakers and actor could come up with such a figure. But alas they did and this is the magic of this film which also features great supporting work and good music to boot."
4,"Another Innovative, Thoughtful Comedy by Woody Allen","Woody Allen is know for any number of things: inventive, brilliant comedies; less than popular serious films; his love of Manhattan; his love of Jazz. In Sweet and Lowdown, he combines a documentary and period filmmaking to great effect. Sean Penn expertly plays Emmett Ray, the world-second greatest guitar player during the great depression. The character is full of ego, booze, talent and humor and it's pulled off without a hitch by Penn and is supported by a solid cast. As is the case with many of Allen's films, a cerebral investment is required from the viewer - this isn't an example of Allen's earlier screwball comedy. All in all, another wonderful film from Woody Allen."
3,Billy Jack Box Set,As a great fan of Billy Jack I ordered the box set mainly to get the last of his shows Billy Jack goes to Washington. Very disappointed in it as it was almost word for word from Mr Smith goes to Washington. There was only one small seen showing his famous kicks. WHile I loved his first 3 movies from the set beware of the hype over Billy Jack goes to Washington. Get Mr Smith instead as I think that was the better of the 2.
3,Not what I remembered,"If you saw the Billy Jack movies when you were young, as I did, you probably missed all the things it was trying to say about political issues, and went for the karate that looked cool back then. Then you grew up watching Chuck Noris, Jean Claude Van Dam,and Steven Segal. Now you can go back and see how few fight scenes there were in these movies and how hokey they looked. I like all these movies because of what the remind me of. I understand what they were trying to say. If you're a Billy Jack fan you know who you are, then these are your movies. I'm torn between liking these movies for what they meant to me years ago, and criticizing them for being so long and drawn out. There is one movie in the set that I had never seen called ""Billy Jack Goes To Washington"". This one is so un-Billy Jack as you can get, only one fight scene. But then again that's not really what these movies were about, is it?"
5,Good value,This is a very good value when compared with local hardware store prices. Gives off excellent light. Will certainly place a reorder.
5,The Gambler: The Adventure Continues,The Gambler: The Adventure ContinuesAs good as the first movie in the series by Kenny Rogers!!
4,Excellent performance by Johnny Crawford.,"This is a good show with good action and fun. As a young cowboy, Johnny Crawford really does a great job handling the action scenes and portraying the young cowboy!"
5,Egg whites simplified,"I recently started a diet where I could only eat the egg white, not the yolk because of the fat content. I make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source. The powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen (anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what I'm talking about)...not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore. I also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs. This is a fantastic product and well worth the cost."
3,WARNING: Watch out for ingredients not listed,"I was in the process of purchasing these when I thought I'd look at the Honeyville website first. But then I noticed that on the company website that there is sodium lauryl sulfate in these eggs, which is not listed on the ingredients on Amazon. Please be aware of this since there are various concerns over the use of this ingredient in all sorts of products.UPDATE 11/16/11: SLS is not good for you and tastes like soap. I went with Del El Egg Whites from Amazon based on another reviewer. No SLS added."
3,powdered egg whites,It is ok. We will be keeping it for long term storage and in case of emergency. Probably won't buy any more.
1,Sodium Laurel Sulfate -- WHY!?,They put in Sodium Laurel Sulfate -- WHY!?. Many people are allergic to this.
5,Great Color Wheel,"Picture shows all circles but the item alternates between circles and squares. I don't think it interferes with the educational value of the product, nor does it lack any artistic value. I just simply isn't what was shown. I have been looking for a color wheel that i can hod up in front of a class. This does that admirably. Thank you. And the colors appear to be color correct, another attribute."
1,The One year internet membership,"We have been on this one year internet program, and it has not been of much help. The food preparation times, and recipe ingredients seem to fit the rich and famous who have chiefs doing their cooking. The constant push to get us to take the expensive Florida vacation at their facility, was not what we joined for. Believe having your own cooking staff, the food intake would be just fine. We live on 2.6 acres of land in a rural setting, and can grow our own basic food needs along with making our own breads. Having left the beef products many years ago, we do well with turkey, chicken, and fish. If you have the financial means to handle this program, it would do your body a world of good."
3,Instructions?,"I really like the look of this product. It is sturdy and requires little maintance. But when I received the feeder, it was in pieces. There were no instructions included. After I finally figured out what went where, the support stake does not screw all the way into the feeder. So this is a good product if you don't want to use the support stake."
2,I don't like Tea,"Some people might say: ""This book wasn't my cup of tea"".I suppose I don't like tea then. Maor's book ""may"" be interesting to the more historically fixated, but being more interested in math, I found this book too light on proof and theory and more of an anecdotal acounting of the lives of mathematicians. If you're like me, you don't care if the Ambasador of Zanzibar created the double-angle equation, you just want the proof; the proof is lacking, therefore so is the book.(My apologies to the Ambasador of Zanzibar, it isn't my intention to implicate you in any double-angle scandal.) I often secretly read math outlines in history class; this is like reading an outline of history in math class. The font was terrific though!"
2,Cute but high pitched sound,"It is not a wonder that this is out of stock and not known if going to be back on line. It is very cute, easy to hold, lightweight, easy to tik tok....for some people it might sound just fine, but for me, I like a more mellow, deep tik tok and this is entirely too high pitched. I tried to cushion it with different materials, to no avail., so I don't really use it."
5,An excellent book about the basics of sailing.,"A very well done, simple to understand, text ofthe concepts and principles behind sailing.Any would-be-sailer in the entire family wouldenjoy this book."
2,Inaccurate explanation of airfoil lift,"This book gives the classic, wrong, ""equal time of passage"" airfoil lift explanation, making the rest of the contents highly suspect. With an airfoil, the incoming particles do NOT rejoin at the trailing edge. In smoke studies for a high-lift airfoils, the upper flow greatly OVERTAKES the underside flow. The particles do not reconverge, there is nothing in physics that prescribes that they should. Would you trust a book on bridges that said heavier objects fall faster under gravity than lighter objects? Of course not. Likewise with this book and its ""particle must catch up"" nonsense."
4,Terrific Slides,"These premium slides are easy to install and are extremely quiet. I used them for heavy duty sliding kitchen drawers/shelves and, so far, they have performed well. I installed them using the published dimensions and did not bother with the boring template. In my view the template is an unecessary expense.Overall very pleased with the product quality and value."
1,Blum customer dis-service,"When you order a Blum drawer slide, the instructions say you must purchase a template for 50 - 60 dollars for the placement of the mounting holes. I guess the company is too cheap to supply a paper template or dimensions for the hole drillings for the products they sell. Another way to rip off the customer."
4,"Very good, with one reservation!","Bought this along with several books on HDR photography. Watching the DVD was like spending time with Tony - a great experience. However, it should be noted that, to receive the best value from this DVD you really need to watch the DVD, go out and take some photos, run them through the software and then watch the DVD AGAIN. The second viewing will allow you to receive the most benefit from Tony's instruction.Tony shows you how he sets up his camera/tripod, techniques for bracketing and how he ""processes"" the images - in fact, he spends a great deal of time going through which sliders he is using and why. This is a very ""organic"" process (each image needs its own unique touch) and you start to get the ""feeling"" about which adjustments work together - and which cancel each other out. This is very important to know when as you start to process your own images."
3,For a beginner,"Good for a beginner in HDR and ""Photomatix Pro"". I would have liked to see more in depth on the affect of the controls in ""Photomatix Pro"". Some actual examples for the user work along with the author would have been great. All in all I give it a C content and a D for cost."
2,Not as Described,"This is not an instructional DVD on how to use the Photomatix software program. The product description needs clarification: You need BOTH Photomatic and Photoshop to use this DVD. There is no mention of Photoshop in the product description. If you are looking for a DVD that teaches how to produce HDR photos using Photomatix, this is probably not it. It is not a step-by-step companion guide. I found the instruction to be very general and moved too quickly."
4,Very Interesting,"I enjoyed this novel very much. It was sad, or more accurately, melancholy like a John Coltrane song. But don't let that statement mislead you. It was well written and enjoyable. Mr. Haughton delivers a tale that is as unique as it is engaging. I will anxiously await his next novel."
5,Compellingly Uxorious,"Chad Hautmann's novel, ""Billie's Ghost,"" starts with a man haunted by his love for his lost wife and then proceeds to haunt him with a living woman who may be the incarnation of a singer who died years before. Our own uncertainty about whether this is really Billie Holiday underscores the uncertain life Hautmann's protagonist has been living -- as he quietly numbs himself with alcohol and inertia -- until ""Billie"" enters the story. Hautmann creates a fascinating Billie; so much so that it may not matter if she is a ghost, a reincarnation or simply a woman who resembles the great singer. Ultimately, the book is a masterful protrayal of the challenges inherent in recovering from trauma and finding a way back into a healthy life."
5,I like it,"Dude, Allegretto implies it's fast. Beethoven's metronome markings for the 2nd movement of the 7th are a lot faster than most conductors conduct at. Von Karajan does it the right way."
4,"Perfect 6th, Rapid 7th","This DVD was my introduction to the concept of Classical music DVD's, and to Karajan's Legacy Series. Both of which, I am thoroughly impressed with! It has all the right camera angles, and sounds.However, it is the interpretation of the 7th that lacks all the glory it deserves. The orchestra plays this symphony way too fast. The first, third, and fourth movements don't seem too bad, but the second movement, Allegretto, is played too fast. If you listen to the version in the movie ""Immortal Beloved"" of the Allegretto movement, it sounds perfect. But overall, the 7th symphony is acceptable.The 6th however, is done exceptionally well. There are however a few shortcomings, like the first movement being a tad bit too fast, and the horns in the third movement not accented enough. But, overall, this is an excellent symphony played by an excellent orchestra.Overall, the DVD is a great buy. A must-have."
3,Buy a CD instead,"The music in this DVD is very good, the performance is good. I give it 3 stars because it was very annoying to watch the whole concert with the conductor's arm obstructing the instruments. You dont get to view the whole orchestra playing, but only reduced parts and with shots that are too close. The camera focuses for too long on the back of the conductor. I also have the ninth symphony and it also has the same problem. Great music, horrible video thet gets on your nerves..."
4,Great Quirky Characters,"In the 1950's, a group of science fiction fans decided to drive to WorldCon to meet their writer idols (and basically to have a big blast). They didn't make it to WorldCon, but they did make it to Wall Hollow, Tennessee, where all the members each wrote a story and buried it in a time capsule.30 years later, several of the members of the group have hit it big as SF writers. Their reunion at Wall Hollow becomes a huge media event, with publishers bidding on the rights to the stories buried in the time capsule. But just before the reunion starts, someone is murdered.`Zombies of the Gene Pool' is an entertaining book which includes well-drawn, quirky characters straight out of the science fiction world. McCrumb's writing and characterization are right on target. The payoff, for me, wasn't as satisfying as the journey, which in itself was quite fun. Fans of science fiction will enjoy this humorous, sometimes bittersweet look at the world of science fiction authors."
3,"McCrumb is a humorist, not a mystery writer","This is the sequel to Sharyn McCrumb's earlier novel,*Bimbos of the Death Sun*, which dealt with the foibles of science fiction conventioneers. Here, the writing is a bit more substantial and there are some interesting twists and turns in the plot. As a serious mystery, however, the work falls flat. McCrumb is at her best as a humorist, particularly when she is lampooning particular human stereotypes, such as sci-fi fanatics. But she hasn't really mastered the art of creating a convincing mystery that draws the reader in and then is wrapped up in convincing fashion at book's end."
3,Intriguing idea just isn't executed satisfactorily,"This is the sequel to Sharyn McCrumb's earlier novel,*Bimbos of the Death Sun*, which dealt with the foibles of science fiction conventioneers. Here, the writing is a bit more substantial and there are some interesting twists and turns in the plot. As a serious mystery, however, the work falls flat. McCrumb is at her best when she is lampooning particular types of people, particularly sci-fi fanatics. But she hasn't really mastered the art of creating a convincing mystery that draws the reader in and then is wrapped up in convincing fashion at book's end."
2,Too much TVA Info,"I have a different viewpoint than the other 2-star reviewer. I feel that ""Bimbos"" is a better read. ""Gene Pool"" had too much information on the TVA flooding of the area. If I wanted that type of information, I would read a nonfiction book. When I read ""Bimbos"" I actually laughed out loud at some points. This book is tedious because of the all the unnecessary back story and history. Once again, as in ""Bimbos"", there are a great many characters to keep track of. I listened to these books on DVD rather than read them and trying to keep track of all characters is difficult at first. It may be easier when reading these stories.Once again, the actual ""mystery"" is secondary to the story, but that's okay; there's enough to keep the reader busy."
5,A pleasant and amusing work.,"I really enjoyed this novel. It was a fun book with a lot of humor, but with a bit of hard edge toward the end. The novel has some great characters and a pretty interesting plot that held my interest and kept me turning the pages at a pretty rapid clip. Another of McCrumb's initial works, it shows that she already had quite a lot of skill early in her career."
3,Something the Other Reviewers Missed,"The other reviewers left out the sadness in this book. For me, the best part is the Lanathides' nostalgia for their lost youth and their readjustment upon meeting their former closest friends after a lapse of decades. I also liked the effective, though obvious, symbolism of the drawdown of the the artificial lake that exposes the long-covered countryside where lay the Slan Shack."
4,Totally different mystery/adventure.,"This highly readable story works on several levels. It apparently contains a lot of insider references to the sci-fi fandom genre, but most of them passed me by. And it didn't matter. I still enjoyed it thoroughly, as usual with her work. McCrumb writes so well, and so solidly, that it's all one can do to take a break rather than read through to the end in one sitting. But I did miss the humor of her funnier books."
2,"None Too Thrilling But Still Better Than ""Bimbos...""","I bought these books because of their amusing titles, but the storylines just don't deliver. I saw the ending of this book coming from a mile away. Still, it wasn't as cutesy and smirking as its predecessor, of which I'm grateful. Read ""If I Ever Return, Pretty Peggy-O"" for a good McCrumb novel."
5,Love These Shorts. Great for the Gym,"I really enjoyed these shorts I wear to the gym all the time. They are very comfortable and feel great. I just wear plain without shorts over, you'll be fine. Happy shopping."
1,No tight enough,"Although material feel confortable, the shrts offers minimal compression, feels no different than regular long briefs. If you are looking for tighter compression, I recommend trying the Bike brand."
1,Sizing not accurate,"Searched for ""compression shorts"" to find these and these are not a compression short. Sizing was not accurate on the chart and ordered a size too small. Returned them due as they were not functional or fitting."
1,don't like it,size is different from other Adidas pants... does not make sense. i have another adidas samba tights which are much better...
4,"great fit, can be a bit transparent","i also have the black samba design so i thought why not vary and order the white version. as with the back version, it is extremely comfortable and for me at least prevents chafe after a long run of more than 15km. i ordered the medium size so the will seat extra tight (i'm 180cm, 80 kg). i also find them perfect for swimming. the only downside is that they tend to get a bit transparent when wet and while combined with a dark underpants."
5,Good Quality,Just bought these compression shorts wore them for exercising and some sparring for my Karate they are good they give me support and flexibility.
5,Veggie Tales,"My grand daughter loves all of her Veggie Tales collection! They are her favorite things to watch! I like them,too.....lol"
1,A BAD JOKE,After Watching this film i feel Kevin Smith Should Seek a Real Job.this Film was Horrible.part Bill&Ted's Excellent Adventure part History of the World part 1&the Rest all junk.Chris Rock is Flat in this Film.same goes for Linda Fiorentino.Matt Damon&Ben Affleck add nothing to this Poor Excuse of Film-Making.i see nothing funny in this Mockery of Catholicism.it's a Travety that this Film was even ever made.
1,Holy bad!,"Kevin Smith is one of those filmakers who will always have a following. People will see (and even say they like) his movies just because it's Kevin Smith -- sort of like George Lucas' fans. I couldn't even finish this movie. And as someone who was raised Catholic, I was looking forward to someone finally ripping on the church. The acting and the dialogue made me wince."
1,The worst movie ever?,"I think what bothered me most about this movie was that it thought it had something intelligent to say. Unfortunately a more cogent argument against religious dogma could be formulated by a 4 year old. And then there's the script. Was this a first draft? The acting was also horrendous, with incredibly annoying performances by Rock, Damon, and Affleck, but with a script like this that was inevitable. In short, do not pay money to see this garbage! Kevin Smith is a one trick pony and needs to stick to stories involving New Jersey and convenience stores."
1,Can't decide what it wants to be,"This movie is all over the place. It can't decide whether it wants to be Time Bandits or The Prophecy. Silly humor is mixed with horrible violence and serious themes in a way that can only be described as........puzzling? There are two possible movies here, and they just couldn't decide which one to make. I was not offended at all, but merely bemused at the complete incompetence of the people who made this, when I wasn't bored to tears that is. I have to go back to Dune to find an equally poor offering. My greatest fear was the the movie itself was going to go on for eternity. I found myself rooting for the bad guys to end all existance. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. I'm sure you can all find better things to watch."
3,Not that good,"I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, and this movie is good based on the fact that he did it alone, but frankly after his brilliant first three films this one was a bit of a letdown. The hilarious dialogue that I loved in his other movies just seemed to be missing in this one, and the plot was also a lot more serious than the dysfunctional love stories of the first three. However, there were funny moments in the film (Affleck and Damon were great as the two angels), and Jay & Silent Bob were awesome as usual, its good to see them featured this much in the movie. However, if you liked this film, check out Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy and see just how much better Kevin Smith really gets."
2,the most WORDY movie I've ever seen!,"I thought 'Clerks' was somewhat a charming, if poorly acted, first film. Realistic setting with OK dialogue.... got a laugh out of Silent Bob, so I figured that 'Dogma' would be a nice leap forward for Smith with its big-name stars and what-not. Turns out that this guy released the single most WORDY film I've ever sat through. It's like listening to anything off of Springsteen's first two albums where he crams in about 200 words per verse (""Blinded by the Light"")Suffering from aural fatigue after viewing this film, I high-tailed it to an abandnoded campground in upstate New York and entered into a vow of silence for one week. No words spoken, none heard. I was tired of the words that every character in 'Dogma' had to constantly utter whenever they were on screen. My creative writing prof in college always told us to ""show don't tell"".Too bad Smith couldn't follow this simple rule."
2,What if religion had survived to the 20th century? And changed somehow?,"OK, so get this: it's a movie about like, God and the apostles and angels, right?But God is a WOMAN!!!And the apostle is BLACK!!And the angel is ALAN RICKMAN!!!And nobody talks like the King James Bible! It's all like, jive!HOLY SHIITE THAT'S BLASPHEMOUS!!!YOU MIGHT LAUGH!!!you have been duly warnedPS: They use the word ""sex"" in it. ""Sex is a joke,"" they say. That's an actual line of dialogue. I didn't know it was until I saw this flick of greatness. SEX!!"
2,Below Average,"It has its funny moments, but overall a big disappointment. Do not invest in the DVD before you see the movie."
3,Jay and Bob's Bible Adventures,"Kevin thinks Dogma is his most profound work. That's why he's ditching View Askew. To produce more Dogma.O Bearded One, mindless piety is not profundity. Who wants to hear Chris Rock coo ""It's not what you have faith in, it's that you haave faith!""Add that to an idiot-plot and Silent Bob's suddenly clownlike expressive range (He doesn't need to speak! He's as lively as the other characters!) and you get, um, three stars.Yes, three stars, because despite the fact that it's an utter intellectual abomination compared to Clerks, Chasing Amy, and even Mallrats, it's entertaining as hell. Go figure."
2,Choose comedy or drama,I was very disapointed in this film. It starts out as a light hearted comedy about two angels who were kicked out of Heaven but have now found a loop hole to get back in. The begining of the film is funny with a lot of great one liners but after that it's all down hill. This is the kind of movie were can't stop looking at your watch to try to find out how much longer you have to sit through this torture.
3,JAY is not funny!!,"First, let me say this: JAY is not funny!! Silent Bob: funny. Jay: not so funny. Jay is a loud, raucious kid who is not funny. That said, the movie is pretty good. Never seen a Kevin Smith film before (don't think I ever will either). I'm not Catholic like the movie (not ever movie can be perfect), but I enjoyed MOST of it nonetheless.Did anyone else notice Jay and Silent Bob in SCREAM 3? Just thought I'd throw that in while I wait for the ""How can you not like Kevin Smith movies"" hate mail."
3,Heart in the Right Place,"Kevin Smith had the right idea for this flick, but the execution was off. Case and point: Linda Florentino. She's what keeps me from being able to watch the movie again and again -- with every eye-roll she executes in order to look sarcastic I wish for her to get hit by a bus more and more.Jay and Silent Bob feel old and tired, it's time for some new characters.Jason Lee and the Damon-Affleck duo are what makes the movie buyable. Especially Lee. He's a badass."
5,Incredibly funny! The truth in this movie is what makes it..,"Seeing from the 1 star reviews of this movie and the ""this didn't offend me but..."" just means that it did.This movie is hysterical. It rips into the hypocrisy of the entire concept of the Church. It's like stigmata meets abbott and costello.I highly reccomend it."
2,i dont come to movies for religion...,"people say this movie puts down catholicism, but it really pushes forward all religion in general...a few funny jokes throughout"
1,"Holy crap, batman","This is without any doubt, the worst film I ever had the misfortune to see. Truly, impressively, stunningly awful, pretentious, stupid... just bad."
2,"This movie is going to hurt, lots.","Whenever you see a movie poster that features the movie's cast the way this one does, by law alone, you know it's going to be a BAD movie. Think about it. But of course we all know there are exceptions to every law, right? That too is true, of course, but for many reasons (that I won't be too kind to site in here) this movie is definitely not the exception. Cliché arguments and characters, just to sum it all up. I'm starting to get sick and tired of so called ""thinking man"" movies that in the end turn out to be such a terrible disappointment (Did somebody say ""Fight Club""?) and yet are capable of remain with a little sense of their pretentious ""originality"" by raving fans. Oh well, everyone has different preferences, isn't it? And no, I am not Christian. (Matter of fact, I am Atheist)"
4,Was given as a gift,So far I have heard nothing but nice things said about it. The shipping and handling was excellent. It arrived earlier than expected and the person I got it for was very happy. He had been trying to locate this movie for awhile.
3,disappointed,can't watch the movie becasue when I rodered this version it was not clear in the description that it was not formatted for play in the US. So I can't watch the movie.
2,OVERRATED TO HIGH HEAVEN,"DOGMA caused much controvery prior to its belated release by Disney. It shouldn't be protested for its content-it basically should be protested for being a bad film! As they told Mozart about having too many notes, this film hastoo many words! I don't mean that in an illiterate sense, I mean it drags on longer than a crucifixion! Kevin Smith must've took the good reviews of CHASING AMY (A really GOOD film) and put his word processor on overdrive typing the script! It makes a few interesting theological points but a ""poo"" monster? That totally took the film to nonsensical levels! It was like Troma Films doing religious satire! You won't need to o to confession after watching this, but you may have to forgive yourself."
2,Ripping off a poor student,"I loved this movie, I thought it was funny, and it had something to say something about life. I couldn't wait till it came out on dvd, so when it did I bought it the same day. To my dismay I found that there wasn't much on it other than the movie. Now, they release another version a year later with extra features hanging out of the package? It isn't fair, I'm a poor high school student, I don't have the money to pay for two dvds of the same movie. I really wish they would stop with the special editions, the collector editions, the super collector editions and whatnot because they are making me go broke!"
4,the worst of the 4,"First, I love Kevin Smith. He's the reason I decided to become a filmmaker. However, Dogma didn't equal his other 3 films. The reason I think is simple. He wrote this film first of the 4, but he waited to make it. And the story just isn't as strong as the other 3. It doesn't draw you in. Chris rock isn't good in his role and neither is Linda florentino. Jay as always is hilarious. He steals the movie.It's not the controversy that is the center of this film, but the slow parts. If it wasn't for Alan rickman, a lot of this film would be very boring. He was wonderful. I recommend this film to anyone, but only a true Kevin smith fan should buy the DVD. Me, I'm waiting for the Criterion Collection Dogma DVD."
4,Jay and Silent Bob at their best!,"I am a big fan of Kevin Smith films,and dogma is no exception.I loved Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith's roles as two stoner prophets.I especially loved Alan Rickman's role as the Metatron,or the voice of God.Dogma is about a woman who is told she has to stop two arch angels from entering a church in New Jersey so they can re-enter Heaven.Sided by the 13th apostle,Rufus,played by Chris Rock,and the two prophets,they encoun ter hillariousness at every corner.Dogma should be funny to people of every religion."
5,Great movie!,Solid performance by many excellent actors. I bought this because I have watched it many times and likely would many more. Only problem is I loaned it to a co-worker who quit and never returned it. So I will be buying another copy.
4,DVD receipt,Item arrived quickly and as described. Some damage to the corners of the box but this more than likely happened in transit. Happy with purchase and seller. Reccomended.
4,DVD Dogma,This was a very difficult item to get in New Zealand. Getting it on Amazon was very easy and was the perfect gift for a big fan of the movie.It turned up within the international shipping time and was a very reasonable price.
3,Dogma,"Should have been a really funny film; the cast was terrific, particularly Alan Rickman. However, I must ask, is there no other word in the English language apart from f...??Most of it was unnecessary and made the funny dialog tedious. Surely people can express themselves without the f-overload. What a waste of a fantastic subject."
5,Best Movie I ever Saw,"When I saw this movie in the theatre, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. Afleck and Damon couldn't have done better. I was disturbed by some of the scenes, but other than that, I reccomend this movie to anyone who loves a good comedy.To make a long story short, I LOVED IT!"
2,"Not groundbreaking, just kind of stupid","I read a bunch of reviews on this site claiming this movie showed a comical look at ""organized religion."" As a catholic, I thought I'd see the movie and , hey guess what? The only things they really made fun of were sterotypes of catholicism. Apparently, the other religions are perfect in every single way, and catholicism has no real place in today's culture, as the movie suggests.The movie, despite it's arrogant views, does offer its moments where it is pretty funny (The scenes with the voice of god come to mind).Overall, I feel this movie would have been a lot better if it simply didn't pick on stereotypes of catholicism, and actually addressed the issues that the movie tries to put forth."
4,"DOGMA-vhs tape; unlike, some other vendors, the product provided here was in excellent shape!","The product<DOGMA~vhs tape: arrived in a timely manner, and, was in relatively good condition! The tape, was,properly, rewound~ So I did not have to suffer watching the conclusion of the movie first~ as, frequently happens, with other VHS purchases"
2,thats for jay and silent bob,ok so i have only seen this and jay and silent bob strike back. i liked jay and silent bob always will since i own jay and silent bob strike back. i would never buy this unless it was for pure idiocity. the story took me nowhere. this disses god. im a very religious person. i did not get this movie. its that hard to understand. i had to watch it twice to give it 2 stars. ok im a huge fan of kevin smith though. hey why else would i rent mallrats and clerks.
4,Kevin Smith is a witty man,"This may be Smith's best picture to date. He never fails to find the humor in situations, be it a cheap fart joke or an amusing observation about the idiosyncracies of life. The film never gets too preachy (what were the protesters thinking - this is a PRO-faith movie) and never takes itself too seriously. The big reason why I think Dogma is better than Chasing Amy? It has a plotted ending, rather than the ludicrous menage-a-trois suggestion at the end of Amy. Dogma is a fairly well-constructed, fun, hopeful, road picture. I do wish the DVD would have had some goodies, but I suspect the SE is in production now. I also wish Mr. Smith would find himself a good cinematographer. His films always have such a strange, ""not quite real"" color to them."
4,Overly Talky But Still Great Fun,"Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"" is an insane blend of comedy, action, religion, discussion, toilet humor, etc. . . It's hard to peg this movie. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are both very good as the renegade angels. The supporting cast is very good also. The only thing wrong with this movie is simply the over-abundance of dialogue. Most of the time, Kevin Smith is right on target with hysterical dialogue that is both funny and insightful but sometimes it feels like his fingers went crazy on the word processor and he let a character blab on too long. Some of the serious dialogue will drive you batty at it's inane lengths. Conversations sometimes last up to ten minutes! Still, though. This movie is highly entertaining and probably Smith's best film to date. I'd rent it before purchasing it."
4,Just get the regular Dogma DVD,"I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan. I love this movie, but I'd wouldn't recommend the Special Edition. There isn't enough extras to warrant a $10 price increase. Unless you're OBSESSED with Kevin Smith, I'd recommend the regular Dogma DVD."
2,God idea poorly executed,"I liked the idea of Angels falling out with each other etc, but I found the film to be extremely patronising as it wore on. I think the film needed more mystery - instead we had Chris Rock and Salma Hayek explaining a muddled version of what we should be believing in. It did make me laugh (Rock espec), but Matt Damon seems to be empty, and unlikeable. It got very cheesy in the closing seqence too. Worth seeing for the Hayek stripping scene."
4,Dogma,"I had not heard of this movie before one day seeing it in the video store. On a whim and having previously viewed ""clerks"" and ""Mallrats"" I gave it a chance. I was hooked at the begining. The biting satirical outlook on religion was refreshing and is definetly a must see. The language is a bit harsh however the movie hits home with its views toward the belief in god is more powerfull than religious doctrine. This star studded movie is definetly the sleeper rental and for those that prefer the status quo wake up and smell the 90's."
2,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF THE DVD!,"View Askew is putting out a more fully loaded version of Dogma later this year with commentary, deleted scenes, etc. So rent this DVD if you must, but don't buy it."
5,Dogma Fulfills Smith's Promise,"Kevin Smith spins an amazing story about two angels trying to return to heaven. Along the way, Salma Hayek does a great turn as a ""dancing schoolgirl"" in an absolutely eye-popping scene. Lots of appearances from some of the View Askew Regulars, even Fan Boy and Steve-Dave. An finally, Alanis Morissette in an absolutely RADIANT performance. What may seem blasphemous at the beginning becomes clearly divine at the end. This movie is better than Chasing Amy, is that possible? The dialogue is snappy, Jay and Silent Bob are given larger roles. Unfortunately, the DVD is not a collector's edition. Would trade my Silent Bob doll for a batch of outtakes. DEFINITE BUY !"
4,A long way from Clerks,"Jay and Silent Bob may be along for the ride, but this movie moves to new ground for Kevin Smith. Its dark, its thought-provoking and most of all its what we like to see from Smith.. its gutsy.The casting and effects are impressive, especially in contrast with Clerks. However, this is far from a Hollywood sell-out. Smith just takes things to a different level.If you are a Christian (especially Catholic) and easily offended, I honestly would suggest you steer clear of this. However, if you can step back and take a quirky irreverent view of the Christian faith, you may find this enjoyable.Overall, it may not be as strictly humorous as its predecessors (and it is far more violent), but it is definately worth your time. Whether you are a Kevin Smith fan or not, just enter it with a clean slate and an open mind and you will not be disappointed."
4,You won't believe how good this film is..,"Biting satire, slapstick comedy and a very heavy message plus good acting (mostly) make this film a real winner. I recommend this one to anyone who is'nt a religious nut (You know who you are) and loves good movies."
5,I AM religious & I loved it!,"ok- I'm charismatic Christian, attend the local Assembly of God, been pretty deep into the Faith for 27 years- and I think DOGMA is among the best three theological films of the past decade- the others being LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST and THE RAPTURE (directed by Michael Tolkin, starring Mimi Rogers). Yep-it's vulgar & tasteless but it's also theologically orthodox & Biblical in it's teachings on Jesus as God-man & Savior. And it had me wincing, howling with laughter & weeping like the tubby ... I am (to cite Jay). Make sure to listen to the Alanis song during the final credits."
3,"Good DVD, okay film.","The DVD is packed with excellent features. The film isn't. The Catholic church is a very easy target for ridicule and this film always makes the easy jokes. At its best Dogma can be really quite funny but at its worst it is simply amateurish, unfortunately there is very little of the best."
4,"A solid movie. Flawed as hell, but solid.","Considering this movie got made for $10 million bucks, it's better than it should be. That's meant to be a compliment, by the way. The DVD is pretty good (considering censoring on the commentaries and the missing documentary from...um, well let's just call them Di$ney), and includes an hour and a half of deleted stuff (a lot of continuity issues are addressed here, and a few scenes would have been nice to see in the film's release), plus there are some insanely funny outtakes (Matt Damon's theories on ""Star Wars"" seal the deal for me). Add to that some rather funny menus (feel guilty for buying this DVD with the opinions of a elderly ""church-goer"") and some funny commentaries from the cast and crew, and you got a ""must-buy"" for fans of the film."
4,Some pretty cool extras one major glitch,I thought this dvd had some really interesting extras but i found one fatal glitch. It may just be in my player but if you try to select a subtitle in the directors comentary with video hijinks it locks up my player completely cannot turn it off or stop it nothing! Have to unplug the player to get it to reset. Never scene anything like it before in my life. You will spend hours watching all the extras in this special edition.
1,...,"Clerks was excellent. Mallrats was okay. Chasing Amy was a little better than okay. Dogma Blew. I didn't even so much as crack one bit of laughter while I was watching this godawful piece of tripe. I was extremely let down. Even Chris Rock was dull. Something I once thought was an impossiblity. I recommend this to any insomniac for a sure-fire cure to their affliction. Mere words can't capture the essence of how putrid this movie was. For the love of humanity, please don't be foolish like myself and actually BUY this movie."
1,ponderous and puerile,"this movie is boring, boring, boring. smith's flat satire lacks subtlety and grace and is redeemed (relatively speaking) only by its moments of ridiculous humor - a feces demon, horny jay, screeching chris rock et al.the damn thing isn't even offensive, except in the sense i paid for the rental.cheap shot? worthy target."
2,Good idea - Decent script - Poor execution,"I have to credit Kevin Smith with two things: having a keen witand an insightful mind. The idea behind this movie was incredible(like his other films), and really made you think about the thingsthat were force-fed to you as a youngster. Also, the script is better than Smith's previous efforts, but... The directing, once again is just awful... END"
2,"Poor humor, flawed theology, but suspenseful","This movie tried to be three things at the same time:1) A rant against Catholicism. Here the movie failed. The writers obviously know nothing about Catholicism by their grossly inaccurate representation of what the Catholic Church professes.2) A comedy. Here the movie also failed. Despite a few humorous scenes, the movie was loaded with foul language, toilet humor, genital humor, and drug humor (although I know this kind of humor is appealing to so many moviegoers).3) A suspense/thriller. Here the movie succeeded. If one can check reality at the door, one can really enjoy watching Bethany, Rufus, Jay, and Silent Bob try to stop two angels from unmaking the world.The movie would have done better to stay on one or two of the above points. Instead, it bounced back and forth among the three. The fact that it only did well on one of them, and great performances by Linda Fiorentino & Alan Rickman, makes this a two-star movie (barely)."
1,Dogma DVD,"Dogma is probably one of if not Kev's worst films. How a Catholic can Make this movie is beyond me. As a Catholic myself I wouldn't cross the line for the sake of ""Art"" if that's what people think art is that's their problem.Kevin is a very talented Guy as are the cast it's sad."
3,ryan hickneys dogma review,"i really liked this movie, it was funny and had action. but no drama, well some drama. this did get good ratings in the theaters and i understand those ratings but i think my ratings make more sense. bye"
1,DOGMA: A Preview of Hell,"DOGMA has scores of ""comedic moments"" pumped into it. The problem is, none of them are the least bit funny.Example: Rock flops down and is asked if he knows Christ. Rock replies, ""Hell yeah, nigga owes me fi dollas!"" I kid you not.At one point, a Sh*t Monster appears. No, I don't mean Alanis Morrissette. An actual creatue made of feces shows up for our ""amusement."" Are you starting to see a pattern?DOGMA tries desperately to push all the comedic buttons it can, but each attempt yields nada. The cast can't save this ungodly flop. Neither can the so-called ""message."" Hell, I don't even think the God it claims to glorify could make this film watchable.If DOGMA doesn't make you an atheist, nothing will."
1,"Do your self a favor, stay away!!!","I hardly ever write reviews here, but when this awful movie appeared like a lurking demon to the left of my monitor I knew something had to be done. This movie was so bad that I walked out about 5 minutes before it ended at the theater. The only advantage to it on DVD is that it can be destroyed. If you like movies with terrible scripts, not-funny toilet humor, bad acting, poor direction, etc, then you MIGHT find this tolerable. How anybody could like this travesty is beyond me."
1,Poorly Delivered Slapstick,"The best part of the film was George Carlin. The theme was one which could have been developed into a very funny film, but, sadly, relied upon foul language rather than good humor for its shock value. Foul language has its proper place in comedy and other genres, but here it was gratuitous coming out of the blue for no reason. In a word: juvenile."
1,Steer clear of this clunker,"Both my husband and I came very near to walking out of this film in the theater. Matt and Ben were funny together in the past so we thought this was going to be a real treat. Well, the acting, production values, script, dialogue, intellectual depth - just everything about this thing was severely subpar. I can't believe they're trying to resurrect this piece of crap for new, unsuspecting audiences. Yes, I can believe it. Incredible."
1,Dogma is a dog.,"I wasn't offended by the subject matter of the movie, I was appalled by the writer's sophormoric views on religion. Read the Bible, don't waste your time watching this over rated piece of trash."
1,Stupid and very boring,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is very boring and uninteresting and the story is just plain stupid. The acting and directing was horrendous as well. Kevin Smith should be ashamed to release such a total piece of garbage like this. I can't believe the actors/actresses agreed to do this movie. It's THAT bad.
2,High Expectations Lead to Disappointment,"While Clerks, Mallrats & Chasing Amy are amoung my favorite movies, I found Dogma disappointing. Unlike the earlier movies, it did not suffer from a lack of star power (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, George Carlin, etc.).Silent Bob & Jay's antics were sometimes funning in Dogma, but they seemed out of place. It seemed as if they were only present to leverage the success of the other movies. That worked well in Mallrats and Chasing Amy, but it didn't here.The movie appeared to be primarily a commentary on religion, in particular the Catholic Church. Like most commentaries wrapped as comedies, it was often rather simplistic. What I took away from it was that the Catholic Church is bad. Okay, that is not a horrible thing to say, but it is really not that interesting.The film did have some funny spots, and if you are a NJ Triology fan, you will propably see it no matter what the reviews say."
3,"An Entertaining Diversion, Not Much More","Watching Dogma is like hanging out with college kids eating pizza, smoking pot, and talking about religion; that is to say, it may be entertaining, but it's not particularly profound, intelligent, or well thought-out. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon work well together, and it's pleasant to watch their chemistry. If that's enough to make you want to watch Dogma, by all means: go, see, be entertained. Just don't expect a whole lot more."
3,"Creative, hilarious premise; but mediocre direction","It's rare to get a comedy that's both brainy and hilarious; it's just too bad that the writer/director is so much better as a writer than as a director. You don't have to be a lapsed Catholic to relate to this movie, but it helps; and I can see why so many uptight religious fanatics protested--I mean the ""buddy Jesus"" idea proposed as a reform of the standard crucifix is gut-busting funny, and certain to send the fanatics for their picket signs. Despite the film's premise grounded in Catholic... well... dogma, this movie could have found a broader audience, had the direction not been so weak. This guy needs a Filmmaking 101 course. Scenes are set-up in the most obvious way, and there is very little creativity in the camera work. I found myself dozing at times--despite the offbeat hilarity of much of the concept and writing. Still, if you like your comedy dark and intelligent, this movie is worth a watch."
3,u n b a l a n c e d,"I thought this movie would've been great, if only two things had been different : MORE JANEANE, WAY LESS JAY. I've always thoroughly enjoyed Jay's hilarious viewpoints, not realizing it's a SMALL-DOSE-OF-JAY thing for me ... it distracts me enough to ruin the film"
5,LOL funny,"This was the first ViewAskew movie I saw. Rather out of order I know but it worked to get me hooked. I'm not Catholic, or even Christian for that matter, but I have a working knowledge of the theology, so I got all the jokes in the movie and found the movie hilarious. It was just too perfect, and Alanis Morrisette as the Great One was priceless."
2,Great Movie; Horrible Disc,"Kevin Smith fans beware, there's a s**t demon of a DVD afloat!When I first saw Dogma, I knew I wanted it! It was a stunning and amazing film. When I bought on DVD, I rushed home to watch the extra features. Heh Heh Heh! Nothing, zip, zadda!If you love this movie and don't have it, buy it.But in order to get the best possible, BUY THE SPECIAL EDITION. IT IS THE SAME COST AS THE REGULAR EDITION! I AM EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU AS IF YOU WERE A FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD FOR A REASON!:)"
3,"Original and funny movie, but the DVD is empty.","This movie deserves more than a featurless DVD with only a theatrical trailer as an extra, hopefully someday a special edition will come out.This movie is very original and very funny. Weather you are religious or not, you will enjoy the fantasy and comedy this movie has to offer. Some may not like the over abitious style of the story, because it is controversial as most of Kevin Smith's films are, but just watch it with an open mind, and you'll enjoy it. If you are not a Kevin Smith fan however, look the other way."
5,One of our favorites,"Dogma is a movie with comedy, drama, and a wonderful look at religion. It watches almost like a parody, and with the language and some crude humor, it would be very easy to get offended, but watch it with an open mind and you will see the real story. Rufus, the black 13th apostle, gives us some great insight into what we really should be doing as followers of Christ. He gives a line to the effect of, 'You guys took a great thing and built a religion around it.' Plus, Alan Rickman is a very attractive Metatron!"
5,"Lighter than Chasing Amy, More Serious than Mallrats","I thought this movie was incredibly entertaining. I will admit that I thought that Jay and Silent Bob were a little out of place, but they kept a more light and funny side to the movie. The dialog in the film was enjoyable, and the ending of the film is something not to be missed. Worth seeing again."
5,Great movie,Kevin Smith is a better director than most. A fresh take on the Bible and the cast is classic View Askew.
4,Blasphemous Reverence,"Or is that reverent blasphemy? Dogma is that rare, refreshing film that actually is about ideas and belief, yet doesn't take itself too seriously at the same time. Since I'm not Catholic I suspect I'm probably missing some of the jokes and religious connotations but that didn't bother me at all. Kevin Smith fans (of which I'm one) can tell you the plot details and characters. I'll just say this: Dogma is a film that makes you think about the deeper issues of religion and what being human is about, without the bathrobe-and-sandals posturing of your standard God-based movie. It's a film that takes its religious implications very seriously but with a wonderful shaggy dog presentation. Sure there's some plot holes and pacing problems, but these are minor flaws in a seriously funny (and comically serious) movie that should raise both minds and discussions."
4,"Great Movie, but where's the Collector DVD?","Kevin Smith creates an amazing story, with amazing characters (imagine that) in Dogma, his latest movie. Like Smith's other films, Dogma is quit hilarious, but it also conveys a strong message about faith. If you have reservations about buying this movie due to the religious content, It is not a catholic bashing movie. I'm catholic, and I wasn't offended. Regardless, the only down side to this DVD is that Kevin hasn't released a Collectors Edition. I'm planning on waiting for that copy... but when I do buy it, I'll be shopping on Amazon.com!"
2,Some good ideas that were very badly executed,"This movie is sort of a cross of ""Rambo"" and ""Oh God!"" Or something. The barbed commentary about organized religion was occasionally funny and occasionally thought-provoking. Unfortunately, neither happened with enough regularity to salvage this flick. The macchine-gun-blasting, head-exploding gratitious violence was repulsive, excessive, and largely irrelevant. I suppose teen-age types will find the abundant use of the F-word funny, but anybody over the age of 21 will probably find it stupid. There were scenes that seemed totally irrelevant to the plot, sometimes the dialog could not be understood, and in general the production and direction left a lot to be desired.George Carlin was good, as always, but that was the only true standout in the film.I give it 2 stars, for what it could have been but wasn't."
5,Satirical Excellence,"This movie is, simply put, a masterpiece. Kevin Smith shows his talent and brilliance in this well written epic. It's full of laughs at the suface and crawling with deep, philosophical questions beneath. This movie brought me closer to God than nine years of Catholic grade school ever did."
5,great film,"A great film that questions the ideas of religious hypocrisy and extreme fundalmentalism. Nothing more than a fantasy , it puts forth the idea that ideas count more than beliefs , and how we shouldn't take every page of religious literature so seriously..after all thats how cults are started. Kevin Smith's writing is brilliant in this one , the humor while forced lowbrow is still hillarious. Jay and Silent Bob are as hillarious as ever , and they were given better screen time than in most of their previous films (except the new film which probably bites )...see it...it's not as offensive religiously as it was played out..but to you softcore types it's ""vulgar"".."
1,One of the Worse!!,"""Ambitious""? ""Funny""? ""Aggressively Intelligent""? Unlike those enlightened souls who found this a five-star hit, I guess I just didn't ""get it."" I saw this film in a theater and it has to be among the worse movies I've *ever* seen!If the DVD version can redeem it as worthy of time and expense, it's just another huge plus for the technology. Maybe you have to be a Catholic or at least a Kevin Smith fan, but my advice would be: Don't waste your time OR your money! There's far better entertainment available.This project is proof positive that not even a great cast can redeem a stinker. If I were Ben or Matt, I'd be embarrassed!"
1,First of all...I hated it.,"First of all...I hated it. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon truly bombed in making this film. You may have heard that many Catholics are outraged at this film...no wonder...it is a rotten film. It's boring, it's stupid, and it has no redeeming qualities. Forget the whole religious offensiveness bit, this movie simply stinks. Bottom line....the title should have been ""Ernest Gets Kicked Out of Heaven and Then Trys To Sneak Back In."""
2,A student film run amuck,"First of all...how did this film get made? I mean, the actors don't even bother to act. It looks like and sounds like a group of friends got together over one too many drinks and brainstormed this whole thing. And good for them if they were able to get on the phone and convince a bunch of idiots to give them money to make it. However, I think it's equally important to have a few drinks in you too in order to get the right buzz required to enjoy this film."
5,"Hilarious, but...",I think you'd have to have spent your high school years at a Catholic school like I did to truly appreciate it.
5,Not as bad as everyone said!,"First of all, I have to say that this movie had me busting a gut! It was so funny. I know that a lot of people won't find the comedic material humorous, considering the fact that it's about religion. Some Catholics I know saw this movie and didn't think it was funny at all, and I really can't say that I blame them. You just cannot take this film too seriously. In no way do they mean to poke fun at the church, they just say the things that everyone has in their minds and don't ever say outloud. I applaud Kevin Smith's courage in making DOGMA. It was a real long shot, but I think it turned out great. Jay and Silent Bob are just a thing of comedic genius, easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. Go see it."
4,Dogma,"I thought that this Religion Fancy movie was really good! I made good sence and will make you think about your religion is many ways, although this movie is fiction."
5,"Very, very witty, funny, and all around clever","If you didn't think this movie was funny, you a)Are too close-minded to understand what Kevin Smith was trying to say in the movie, or b)haven't seen his other movies. If you did, you would have understood Jay and Silent Bob, you would have recognized the clerk that sold Bartleby and Loki the gun, you would have recognized Asriel, and many other little things like those, or c)didn't get it.If you didn't think this movie was funny, you missed the point of it. It's a great movie, with great acting, great dialogue, even if it is F-word heavy, and lots of underlying meaning. If you watch this movie with no understanding of history or the Catholic religion, you won't get it. It's as simple as that.Don't listen to those who tell you this movie is boring or stupid. They didn't get it. This movie does not target the stupid, nor does it target the elderly. If you fall under either of these categories, don't waste your time; you won't like this movie."
3,Reassurring for Christians?,"Quite funny (haha) film is marred by uneven acting, dialog, pace. Kevin (Silent Bob) Smith earns points for tackling an iconoclastic interpretation of his religion, and it's refreshing to see angels in some other form than the usual airy-fairy brooch or wind chime.Hip Christians will probably revel in its affirmation of their particular faith, but this non-Christian found the film merely amusing. Maybe you gotta be Christian to ""get"" some of the jokes, but there are some conflicting messages that don't see to be due to artistic license... I felt Smith makes the denizens of heaven more Olympian than Christian.A curious film, will get you talking, at the very least."
5,I can't believed I liked this movie.,After watching the first ten minutes of it I just fall in love with this movie. I thought I would not like it but it is a must-see!
4,"Great movie, disappointing DVD","When I saw ""Dogma"" in the theater, I was impressed. The movie was extremely entertaining, and I did not find it offensive in the least. With all the great extra features other Kevin Smith DVD's pack, I could hardly wait for the day that ""Dogma"" was released on DVD.The DVD still contains the movie, but compared to the ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"" and (upcoming) ""Chasing Amy"" discs, this one is a let down. We get no commentary, no deleted scenes (and there were MANY), no anything really, except the trailer.Get the disc for the film's sake, but don't expect any cool bells and whistles."
2,Good ideas... but flawed in execution,"Dogma has some funny moments and contains the kernel of a good film, but unfortunately these are lost in the loose direction and slack editing. There are quite a few plot problems and they are never really resolved properly. A few more months in the editing suite may have worked wonders for this film, but overall it was very disappointing.Ed Wood would've been proud."
4,"All this with Jay and Silent Bob, too.","What if two fallen angels found a loophole that could get them back into heaven? Now what if that same loophole might just cause the destruction of the entire universe?That's the premise of this wonderful movie. (And don't believe the rumors you've heard about blasphemy and damnation for all that see it!)With plenty of theological ""inside jokes"" to keep any Catholic school graduate enthralled, the plot, action and dialog all make this a very enjoyable and compelling film. Truly comical. Truly intellectual (Hey! don't let that put you off!). But mostly, truly enjoyable.If you liked Jay and Silent Bob from Mall Rats, you'll love this film!"
5,Funny As Hell! The Place where Kevin Smith will got to after,this is the funniest movie in years. it has a nice spoof on religons. if you are a strict catholic you might get offended by it but if you are not uptight about religons you will love it
5,Hits the Nail on the HEAD!!!,"I almost didn't watch this movie when it came on TV because of the scenario: 2 angels must be stopped before they destroy the world. I ain't Oprah and I ain't into no angels. But, I DID watch it and it was GREAT! This movie reflects my EXACT view of ""the religion thing"". It's a fantastic movie and anyone who's thought about the subject of religion and is honest about it will love it too. Only thing - probably should shoo the kids out of the room. The language used ain't no ""Thee"" and ""Thou""."
4,"Bizarre, but good","""DOGMA"" is a good movie. It's incredibly bizarre, but in an interesting way. Some may hate it--sex is mentioned, drugs are used, and language abounds.Alan Rickman, as Metatron, is excellent and probably the best actor in the film. Matt Damon & Ben Affleck (renegade angels banished to Wisconsin for the entire span of human history) are actually quite good, and their friendship comes across.My only complaint with this movie is that it could be so much more polished. The story line is a little choppy and jumpy in some places, the language could be cut down (not because I find it offensive, but because it disrupts what the characters are trying to SAY), and some of the drug usage (do we really need to see an angel smoking weed?) is absolutely pointless.Good movie, though, with good points. If you're interested in watching it, rent it. Chances are you'll hate it--or love it."
4,Not for some people but...,"This movie is still funny! Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes are so wonderfully mismatched that you can't help but laugh at them. As the angels, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are sinister enough to try and outsmart God to allow them entrance into heaven. Chris Rock, George Carlin and Salma Hayek are all funny additions to the film. Alanis Morissette's depiction of God was one I could've lived without. No, it's not intended for people with strong religious beliefs, but those who can watch it objectively will find it has a positive message about Catholicism and it's place in the world."
1,A few chuckles but mostly boring,"Considering the ""star power"" that this movie has in it, I thought perhaps this would be a GREAT movie. All I can say is, I found it to be EXACTLY the opposite. I found it to be most mundane and was rather disappointed. Am I catholic? No! Did I find this movie to be blasphemous? No! Simply put, it was a movie based on angels that were trying to get themselves back into heaven after being put aside. The only humor I found in it were some quips by Chris Rock."
1,Could Have Been Enjoyable But Too Much Swearing,A poke at religion is ok. But a poke at religion where there is constant obscenities is unsettling and detracts from the movie. The Matt Damon character is particularly hard to listen to.There are plenty of movies that are extremely funny but don't have to lower themselves to the gutter to be so......
1,DOG MAN!,"One star for just having George Carlin in it - though he was wasted - a shame, given that Carlin's own rantings against organized religion far surpass the fare contained in this film. Dogma is sophomoric, puerile fodder. Not truly insightful. Superficially blasphemous. If you want outrageous, intelligent theological satire, read ""Only Begotten Daughter"" by James Morrow - a book that will NEVER be made into a film. Having seen all of Kevin Smith's films, I'd say his storytelling abilities are best displayed in his recent ""Daredevil"" comic book run - though even there, he floundered in the final act. Chris Rock wasn't bad, but could've done so much more with better material. Finally, any ""insights"" proffered in this film (There is No One True Religion; Jesus Was Black) are nothing new to anyone above a certain age/literacy level. I'd like to recommend it as mindless fun, but can't since the pretentiousness of Smith mitigates that."
1,See it on TV. Sort of a waste of time.,"I agree with the nay-sayers. I saw all of it, felt I sort of wasted my time, and then erased it. God bless TV - we can record them and then erase them."
2,an interesting but controversial film,"After hearing that this film had offended many Christians, I decided to see it and find out. Being Christian myself, (protestant) I was curious.I heard that this film was offensive particularly to Catholics. Not being Catholic, I wasn't sure of everything that would be offensive to them, but I can see why so many Catholics were offended.It does have a few scenes that offended me, but there are plenty of other films which were far more offensive.If you are devout Catholic, this movie will offend you. If you are a Protestant, this movie might offend you. If you are secular and like off-color humor, you will probably like this film."
4,Pokes Fun At Religion,An average woman is reluntantly drawn into biblical events in the modern day.She is joined by verious types of biblical figures weather she wants the help or not!
3,Alanis Morisette??? What the f....,"Come on Kevin...the whole movie was really pretty good until we get to the end. Were you just bored with it or what? A horrible end to, what was looking to be, a pretty descent movie. Jay and Silent Bob were good, like always. The end of the movie was approaching, and then, Alanis Morisette pops on the screen and whalaa, it's over. Stupid end. To those who haven't seen it, oops, oh well, I gave it away. You'll thank me later."
4,This Movies A Blast!!!!,"LOL...Aww man this is 1 of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It's better than Austin Powers, I think. I rented this one day when I was sick & it cheared me up bigtime! It was so funny & entertaining. Though I could see why people would be offended by this. It was really offensive to Catholic Religion. But still, even though I'm Catholic, I was able to lighten up & enjoy this funny funny comedy. Some of the performances are the funniest parts of it. Ben Aflect & Matt Damon have some hilarious dialoge. All the actting was great I think, it was over the top, and I think it needed to be for this film. Go rent this one now!"
5,Couldn't have said it better myself,"Being Catholic(as Kevin Smith is) I found this movie amazing. Aside from the movie being excellent, Smith says common sense things about Christianity in this flick that most of us thinking people wondered all the years we have sat in the pews. Yes, this movie will probably offend you if you have strict beliefs about the unfaltering authenticity of The Bible. However, if you have any sense of humor at all(and realize that even Biblical writers weren't perfect) you will probably enjoy this movie. I don't really see this as a Jay and Silent Bob flick(although it definitely is) as I do a religious satire. I need to get my priest to watch it. I bet he would enjoy it."
2,Banal,"I think this movie is mainly a hoot for catholics with a sense of humor. Drop that angle, and there's not much to like. A pretty hokey plotline, too many big names for no reason and no part, not doing any acting, working with a script that tosses out ideas that have a 1-second shelf life. And the down to earth modernization of mythological and religous people is Neil Gaiman stuff, Smith does it completely superficially, although they both kind of flub that awesome idea and fail to get to the emotional side of such an issue. Particularly here though, it does not rise above gimmick at all.This is the first Smith movie I've seen, and so far he comes off as someone the public idolizes for his intelligence, mainly because he has dialogue about topics and his non-conformist appearance. There's so much more that can go into a movie though then posing a sort of intellectual question and then flexing the 'i'm people' roots persona."
5,Who's house? Ron's house!!,"Is ""haha"" one word or two? Either way. That's how I sum it up: Haha. -A very funny movie. You gotta look past the ""fairy tale"" side of some of it though. And you also gotta realize they're not making fun of God, or religion.Ben Afleck, and Matt Damon, give a great peformance. They always make a good team. And Jay and Silent Bob are pretty cool too. I highly recommend seeing this one. With an open mind of course."
4,It's the dialogue stupid.,"You see Kevin Smith films for the dialogue, not the cinematography. He really is a great writer with a quarky mind. He has some fascinating ideas. A major disappointment with this DVD is a lack of extras. A commentary track from Smith would have been great and made this one a must in a collection."
3,Kevin Smith Does it again,"On the audio commentary of Mallrats, Kevin Smith says that if 30% of cinemagooers get his humour then he's a happy guy. Watching this in the cinema I would have to say that was the case. His subtle yet clever humour shows us that there are still filmakers who don't want to spell everything out for you, who give you a little credit, and teach you things Kevin Smith style. There are those out there who complained that it was anti religion - but the survey says NO, I think it was pro religion, I am an athiest but laernt from this. It is a great film but the DVD is a let down. I already own Clerks and Mallrats, both which are packed full of extras, so I initially worried that the low price tag on this release would be a give away, but hoped nevertheless. I was wrong, no commentary, no behind the scenes stuff, no outtakes. On this ground the disc must be rated down hence my 3 stars. So to to close - great film, poor disc."
2,Too many useless features,"Don't get me wrong: Dogma is an hilarious movie that goes to the border on religious situations all the while maintaining some seriousness. The cast is superb, bringing in stars for starring roles and cameos alike. When I found out that Dogma was a coming out in a 2-DVD set I nearly lost it, and when I watched it I nearly lost it for the other reason. Most of the features are incredibly boring. The best parts of the movie were seriously in the movie and there is a big reason why those deleted scenes were left out. The commentary by Kevin Smith et.al. is sometimes funny but mostly gets in the way of the movie. If this comes in a single DVD I would get that so you can enjoy Dogma without having to pay, financially and mentally, for all the extra features."
1,Hollywood - promoting the Antichrist again?,"Content: Antichrist Language: foul Dialog: almost no value added Acting: average Humour: where? Role model value: -9 (on a scale -10 to 10)In few words, this is just another piece of Hollywood trash.Quoting myself: ""I don't like to play the role of the critic or judge."" But this movie is worthy of my expressing my impressions:1. I grew tired of the profanities very fast - I lost track of the dialog 2. I did not like the gore/violence 3. I did not like anything 4. I fell asleepThe movie is heading straight to the trash compactor."
1,Ho hum!! How juvenal can we get,"I looked forward to seeing this movie and cannot begin to tell you how absolutely b-o-r-i-n-g it turned out to be!! The concept has a hole that you could drive a Mac truck thru, and the execution is embarrassing to all concerned. By the time I was half-way through the movie, I really didn't care one way or the other. Even the jokes were on a tenth-grade mind level. Oh well, it gets one star (instead of none) because they were smart enough to keep Morisette from opening her mouth!"
4,Something Different,"Is this the best quality film I have ever seen? No, it is not. However, it is a creative look at a serious topic and I think it is worth seeing. And the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The first time I saw the movie I was intrigued and it has continued to grow on me. The quality of the cast makes some of the cornier lines work a little better. I would recommend this movie."
2,uneven,The skewering of organized religions isalways welcome but a film with this muchdialogue needs to have greater depth tobe compelling. The writing is occasionallywell done but that is not enough to save themovie from tedium.
2,It's a road trip movie,"Highlights: Not nearly as offensive as it could've been. Decent performances from the actors with some notable exceptions. Some amusing dialog. Salma Hayek and Alan Rickman give great performances, especially considering some of the lines they had to read. The scene on the train is, indeed, amusing.Lowlights: Not nearly as offensive as it could've been. Decent performances ruined by poor staging (any seen where Linda Fiorentino is having a conversation). Some really lame gags. Too much Jay and Silent Bob -- small doses.The director seems better at character/dialogue driven movies. Plot-driven stories like Mallrats and Dogma seemed rushed; in this case, too much dialog is given over to explication. I will give him credit though: he managed to get Ben Affleck to wipe that annoying smirk off his face on the train scene."
4,Hard topics in 10 seconds,"Anyone having to write about philosophy knows that the hard part is do it with few words. Twain's ""sorry i wrote a long letter, i hadn't time to write a short one"" applies like a glove.The true achievement of this movie is to be able to combine audio and video to express intense and charged concepts in a matter of seconds.Agreeing with then or not, it's not the question. The question is whether or not from an artistic perspective, you are able to get ""something"" from your time. The answer is yes.This is not a philosophic thesis or and artistic master piece and hence it can only be judge for a piece of great entertainment.You may want to also seeMonty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition"
5,Witty,"There are very few films were one can compliment both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in their acting efforts. Besides ""Good Will Hunting"", this is another one of those efforts. Cast of the movie is fantastic. Alan Rickman is great in his role as voice of God and it is delightfull surprise to learn that the God is in form of beautiful and serene Alanis Morisette. Chris Rock will not fail you as one of the ""forgotten"" apostole (13th one that happens to be black). Unless you are an individual too serious about your Catholic faith, or just too God fearing Christian in general, you will find this movie to be smart, funny and very entertaining. I will be the first one to admit that I did not expect much of this movie and I got a very nice treat. This is one of the comedies that you will always think of fondly - if you are humble enough to laugh at yourself. I believe that every one of us can see themselves or someone close we know in this colorful display of characters."
3,"3RD BEST KEVIN SMITH MOVIE,BUT VIOLENCE KIND OF RUINS IT","Funny,smart,obscene,and quite brilliant,Kevin Smith shows us a comedy about christ,good and evil,sinners and saints.after a two fallen angels Ben Affleck and Matt Damon fall to earth all kinds of trouble ensues,after Alan Rickman tells Linda Fiorentino to travel to New Jersey she is almost killed by hockey players sent to kill ordered by devil Azrael but slackers Jay and Silent Bob help her,and travel to New Jersey and take the 13th apostle,Bethany,and others to help.only reason it's 3 stars and not five or four is because violence kind of ruins it and Linda Fiorentino in her worst role.but there are some funny bits.Rated R for Violence,Profanity,Crude Humor."
2,Dog..............ma,"Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy are all classics and I think that must have weighed heavily on Kevin Smith when he made this film.All the bits which captured your imagination and funny bone in the first three movies are gone, what you are left with is a movie with very little to offer.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon bring some star power to the movie, but to be honest, the earlier movies worked better with a higher proportion of little known actors.It just doesn't work as a movie!"
3,"5 stars for movie, 1 star becuase it crashes my DVD player",Does anybody else have problems with this special edition crashing the DVD player?
2,The downward spiral that is Kevin Smith,"First he made a no-budget black and white comedy set in a store. Clerks. It was funny, clever and hugely enjoyable. Then he made the under-rated Mallrats. An enjoyable, yet idiotic, romp through a Mall. Then he tried something more serious with the twisted love triangle and came out with Chasing Amy, a film with some great moments, but never a truly satisfiying whole. And now Dogma! Which, let's face it, it a steamy pile of pretentious Dogdo! OK, so, there's a couple of funny lines. Wow! And Silent Bob and Jay are in it. Um, Wow! And, um.... it's just garbage. A great big sweaty pile of pretentious garbage. I'm so not looking forward to his next film if this is that pattern of his career."
2,Blu Ray,"I wont review the movie plenty reviews here already. So you want to know about the Blu Ray, well having just watched it inspite of the good reviews before me, I dont quite agree. I dont know what the quality of the DVD is like but I didnt find the blu ray anything special. But what I did find annoying inspite of the fact its supposed to be a 5.1, I found the sound to be sub-standard. The dialogue was low and not crisp and had to up and down volume with the scene. Any action sound was over the top. I just found the sound annoying and no way to par to what it ought to be. Personally Id say just go with the DVD.PS. I went through the deleted scenes and you wont believe just how bad the quality of them was not even VHS quality. So Id say they didnt invest much if anything into this blu ray hence my suggestion to go for the DVD if half the price, this aint anything special at all. 2 Stars for the blu ray experience."
5,What was this guy watching?,"C'mon! Kevin Smith is the best new director on the scene! (Well '95 new) Conversations that last 10 minutes? For those of you without A.D.D. buy this movie. If you liked Clerks or MALLRATS you'll love this... especially if you're ""not of the faith."""
3,Nice Try,"Plot is cute.. two angels, need to go back to heaven.. they'll be destorying mankind in the process. A fantasy. The readers of ""Fool On The Hill"" would find some similarity to the movie's character - it's a well entertaining story, a few comic lines (not ones that would make you fall to the ground holding your about-to-burst tummy), but you don't really connect. That's the movie's main problem, in my opinion, lack of authenticity. However, one may find an interesting theological concept, as to whether or not the catholic church ruins belief with its harsh policy. Better rent it. Don't spend your money on it unless you've fallen in love with it."
2,GORE complete-ists only -,"An early (PERHAPS the earliest) example of the ""gore"" sub-species of cult horror genre.The ""effects"" are, quite frankly, a yawn or laughable - depending on your frame of mind.The rest of the movie might have been a project of Ed Wood - - if he had had an additional $200.00 budget.It is hard to imagine that this picture could be of interest to anyone but collectors of niche market video."
2,Nice edition of an okay film,"Not having seen this film in 30 years or so I didn't remember much. I bought the DarSky version expecting the film to be your typical rendition of an older, low budget B & W film with a bad print and generally not very good looking. I recently got a 42"" Sonis Bravia LCD TV and have been watching some of my films on them. From Superman (78), The Birds, The Poseidon Adventur, Koyaanisqatsi and some others they all tended to not look as good as I expected. Surprisingly The Flesh Eaters was one of the best looking of them when blown up to fill the whole screen. The photography, for the most part was crsip and clean without much graininess.As far as the story goes it was enjoyable with some pretty decent acting, even with some of the not so great dialogue. A couple funny lines and some corny characterizations add some amusement. The effects, alas, were disappointing if not slightly ambitious for this kind of film."
3,NOT BAD!,"Bad enough to be entertaining, but not really all that bad! Features attractive women, quirky performances, and pretty cool monsters."
3,Love knows no color,"""Their Own Receive Them Not"" is a fascinating work by African-American gay seminarian Horace Griffin. Griffin makes the compelling argument that African-American LGBT people face discrimination because African-American sexuality has been demonized. Griffin recounts the story of Barbara Jordan, one of the first African-Americans to serve in the Senate, whose life partner was marginalized at her funeral. It's a sad irony when current RNC head Michael Steele rails against same-sex partner benefits. After all, interracial marriage was once demonized.""Their Own Receive Them Not"" explores the usual arguments against homosexuality, African culture, and how African-American LGBT deal with the stigma against them. One of the book's weaknesses is that it isn't lengthy enough. It attempts to plumb the depths.On a side note, I was unable to find this book through Amazon's search engine, even when I used the title and author name. I had to use Google. Any theories?"
4,Their Own Recieve Them Not,I simply love this book. It has now become one of my favorites on this controversial topic regarding the Black Church's Homophobia. I think the author did an excellent job in his research and covering of many important points within this longstanding argument. This is a book for those seeking fair and intelligent and self empowering answers. It blows the lid off of the church's ignorance and their longstanding skewed or distorted beliefs regarding homosexuality. HIGH FIVE TO THE AUTHOR. I even used it as a reference in my Doctorate Dissertation.
4,Their Own Recieve Them Not,"In preparation for writing my Doctorate Dissertation on Therapy for Black Gay Men, I found this book to be a highly informative, researched and written reference. The author touched upon several critical points in the hard discussion regarding the Black Church (Christianity) contradictory, if not blatant, disrespect towards gays and lesbians. This book has become one of my favorites- not to be loan out to anyone. Just buy your own copy- ha ha!!"
5,Essential.....,"If you sometimes have problems knowing how to start and/or finish songs or phrases, this book is a must have! It guides you through the process and helps to expand your imagination."
1,Poorly written.,"I encourage anyone who is considering purchase of this book, to actually study the first few pages. The book is written in the same manner throughout, so whether this book will be useful to you or not, will be obvious in the first few pages.For myself, I found his explanatory paragraphs extremely difficult to follow and had to actually study and re-read several times each paragraph to figure out his intention. Then the samples were a second challenge, since they are not ""clean"" examples of the points that he was trying to make. For example, in demonstrating the Imaj7-IIm7-V7-I progression in the first sample, he uses notes that are not part of these chords. He does this throughout the book, unnecessarily complicating the point.He warns of this in the 5th paragraph of the Preface, where he states: ""alterations that appear in the examples are not always indicated in chord symbols"". This simply complicates the issue and lessons needlessly."
4,"Sturdy, fun in the pool!",This is a great toy for the pool. Fun for all ages as it is light and easy to grip. Very durable!
1,Returned this,"I take a lot of supplements in capsule form, but this one made my stomach sick. I returned this after a week."
2,Not Sure If This Does Anything,"I went through an entire bottle before deciding anything. I didn't notice any improvement in mental or immune function. The manufacturer does a good job of describing all of its products, and I believe they did their research. Just not sure what's going on with this stuff."
2,"Dirty, beat up, nasty bottle","I wouldn't even try this product--although the other ones I got were nicely packaged, clean, and unopened. This one and another bottle were openned, dirty, beat up, and had black gunk on them. blech."
5,The Best Supplement Period.,"I had moderately servere psoriasis for 15 years until Curcumin with bioperine. Took it for two months and no longer use my psoriatic meds. UNREAL. It is the bioperine that dramatically enhances absorption of curcumin. In fact curcumin without bioperine is useless. Psoriasis is autoimmune illness with potential heart and circulatory complications and a cheap, safe supplement that can cure it is beyond belief. Curcumin has other mind blowing benefits (cancer pervention, heart benifits, brain health as well as others). It is the bioperine though that is mandatory for absorption. I take many supplements, do much reading on supplements and I can say that Drs Best C with Bio is the most beneficial supplement for optimal health period.Oh well psoriasis came back, after 6 months. But I do love this product. Great price too."
5,I bought this product because I heard it helped kill imbalances in your body like yeast or fungus. I think I really feel better.,I have excema real bad and I think I get candidae in my system.I am taking this and black current oil and feel better.
2,Died after 3 1/2 years,"I used this solely as a cd player because it is very thin and takes up little space on top of the receiver. I didn't love it while it worked, it took too long to turn on and to eject a cd, sort of slow moving. But the sound was fine and really for the price it was ok. But after 3 1/2 years it just one day stopped turning on. I had to break the cover to get the cd out because it only ejects when it has electricity. So I will look for something new, not Sony, to see if something else holds up better."
1,Total junk,"This player is complete trash. It lasted only three years before its main chip begins overheating and shutting down the player. Sony wants me to buy a new one???? Rubbish. I paid almost eighty USD us dollars at Best Buy for this trash and they expect me to pay them more? Whatever happend to good craftsmanship? Are they not have no pride in their products? Sony has lost me as a customer. I will not pay Sony anything anymore. Sony, you owe me."
2,a data point,"This is a nice looking unit and I had a good experience with it for15 months. A few days ago it died -- or rather everything'sworking except the DVD playbook. The same symptoms asAnthony L. Ellison and Don Romig report, see earlier reviews."
2,wont make this mistake again,Well we have had two of these same models in 2 years. Each of them quit working within a year. So we are looking for a different brand now. Good luck with this one. Worked well for a short time.
1,Don't Make The Mistake of Buying this Trash,"Just like the majority of the reviews, mine died after a year of very little use. I doubt that it read 60 DVD's. It played everything I threw at it until it died. This player is ripe for a class action suit. This is worse than Sony's old ""Error 13"" problem. This is the last Sony product I will ever buy. The quality goes out before the name goes on. Welcome to the world of Communist China's electronics."
2,Great- for awhile,"This product had great picture, almost no skips- but broke for no reason whatsoever after only six months of use. Definitely would not recommend and will not be getting another, despite the good qualities. Not dependable enough."
2,Playback is prohibited by area limitations,"This player DOES NOT PLAY everything you throw at it as some have claimed. For example, it's very picky about media files, takes a long time to read or doesn't play them at all. There is no support for firmware updates either and only accepts Region 1. Despite the clean picture, it's going back to the store in trade for the Philips DVP-642 I picked up also. I hate limitations, and I got to say that the Philips DOES PLAY everything you throw at it.Sony is a quality product, but they got to get on the ball."
2,"Easy to use, but poor picture","I bought a Sony DVP-NS575P today to replace my old Sony DVD player. It is an entry-level progressive scan DVD player and I would otherwise recommend it as a nice, easy-to-use unit except for the quality of the picture. Perhaps I just got a bad one, but the picture simply doesn't have enough contrast. Everything looks dim no matter how I adjust my television. The picture also shows lots of digital artifacts (flickering, etc.) that I find annoying. The old player and the current VCR don't have these problems, so I know it isn't my TV. Needless to say, I cannot recommend this DVD player and I will be returning mine."
1,Sony falls short,"Got this player almost a month ago. It had been excellent. The Best picture quality I have ever seen with a DVD Player. The buttons are way to small and hard to push especially the power button. I was ready to give this player 5 stars until last night while watching a new DVD. The player about half way through the movie the drive started making a funny noise kind of like the sound it makes when it starts reading the disk before it plays. The picture just stop but recovered quickly. I was shocked! It did this every 5 to 10 minutes for the rest of the movie.What a huge disappointment! I really liked this player. Hands down the Best picture quality but skipping on brand new DVDs, NOT COOL! This player is going back."
4,A Beautiful Mistake ....,"Well i must say in all my time with DVD technology, there is not one brand that doesnt even compare to Sony's PICTURE QUALITY. But Versatility wise.... thats another story . I picked up this dvd player for the DVD+RW ability, the precision picture and progressive function, and have no problems with it at all in that perspective. In fact i love this player because i pretty much use it for the DVD+RW function ... But the one thing that it is missing that some of the other players have, and i dont think Sony realizes that its pretty much the standard when it comes to video encoding... and thats (DIVX) .. yes folks be aware that this player does not play DIVX files .. so with this in mind i rate this a 4/5 ... you almost had it Sony"
1,A totally defective product,"This is my second Sony DVD player. I bought the first one two years ago, and it broke within two years. I bought the second one less than two months ago, and now this one is broken, exhibiting exactly the same malady. This is clearly a defective product. What's worse is that Sony is notorious for terrible customer service, so I'm probably out another $100. I can surely say that this will be the last piece of Sony equipment I ever waste my money on. If you want a quality DVD player, you should probably look elsewhere."
4,MP3 difficulty,"This player does everthing a basic DVD player needs to do with respect to playing movies. Great. However, the lack of an optical out is a bummer when hooking up the system to a nice receiver. If I burn a party mix on MP3 and want to play it, the player has no options for random or shuffle (it does on regualar CDs, but not MP3). It seems like a very simple feature to add. Nonetheless, it is a quality DVD player, I'll just have to purchase something else to play my music."
3,Sony: aint what it used to be,"I have bought a lot of Sony stuff over the years. Stereo equipment, phones, computer equipment, everything. It was always high quality and very reliable. I was definitly a die-hard ""sony only"" person.Lately, it seems like they've been cutting corners and this DVD player falls into that category. It seems to play DVDs fine (at least for now), but regular CD playback is static-ridden. I tested the same setup using a 10-year old sony CD player and it played beautifully. Returned the unit and got a new one-- same problem. Sony just doesnt' have the magic anymore!"
1,Sony is finished.,"This unit worked for about 1 hour. Then the drive failed. It doesn't even spin up. It's the second Sony failure for me (the first was their slv-350 dvd/vcr combo, which failed within one week of purchase) I've previously owned two other Sony dvd players which worked well and a toshiba portable which also works fine. But if my recent experience is any indication, Sony had better start making some good movies, because their consumer electronics division is going right down the toilet."
3,ok,"The good thing about this player is good sound quality,good clean picture but the bad thing is about every 4 hours the picture fades from light to dark for about 5 min.In order to fix this problem,just turn your tv and your player off for about 30 sec.Then u could get back to your movie,cd,etc.Sony is normaly a high-quality brand except for this player.i hope this review helps!"
2,Lasted 16 months.,"Bought this brand new from Amazon for around $79 in September 2004. Watched many movies with no problems. Then January 2006, just stopped playing DVD's. VCR's seemed to last forever, these DVD players seem to last a year or so. I've been through 2 Toshiba's, a Panasonic and now a Sony. There's gotta be a DVD player that lasts more than 2 years somewhere."
1,Can't read my DVD-R discs...,"I bought this DVD player because my old Zenith unit have difficulties reading the DVD's I burn on my computer. Sometimes, it skips some images and it is slow in the beginning of playback. I tought that a new unit with all the new technologies would help. Not at all !This DVD player can play all my commercial DVD's... but when I put any of my own DVD's, it only return me the message ""C 13 70 - the disk is dirty""... even on a brand new burned DVD fresh out of my computer... At first, I tought that it was my burner... So I put my DVD in my neighbor player: no problems. I tried it in my old Zenith: no problem. I put it in the new Sony unit: ""C 13 70...""Believe me, I'm a big Sony fan. My video cam is a Sony; my computer is a Sony; the burner in my computer is a Sony; my TV set is a Sony; even my telephone is a Sony... But all I could say is DON'T BUY THIS DVD PLAYER ! It is a big disapointment for me..."
3,It's too loud. What? I said it's too loud. What?,"This seems to be an uncommon complaint, but I have found it in a few places and wanted to reiterate it here for my fellow drive noise suffers so they know they are not crazy. I just got one of these today and the drive is loud. I mean really loud. If you want to recreate the experience of trying to watch a movie on the back of a plane this is the DVD player for you. It may only be 1 out of every 1000 players, but from the online comments I've seen, when you get a loud one, you get a loud one. And I got a loud one. It's going back tomorrow. Otherwise, I generally had the same complaints, the interface sucks and the remote is cheap and missing a few obvious buttons. It's back to the drawing board I guess."
2,"Good Picture, Poor durability","The picture and sound on the DVD Player are top notch, you can't argue that, but the durability is horrible. Mine lasted only 6 months and now I get a buzzing noise from the audio. My (...) magnavox has lasted almost two years."
4,An OK player,"This is a nice player, has many features. It's a good secondplayer. I got the 35 series Panasonic from amazon.com a fewyears ago and the Panasonics let you use a ""Users"" setting forpicture, but the Sony allows you only two ""Dynamic"" and two ""Cinema"" settings plus ""Standard."" Beware of Sony, though, theyare not the quality company of say 15-years ago (I had a 14-yearold Sony 27"" that was a performance beast).Oh yes, you can get this at Walmart for $69.xx plus tax and have the option of returning it within 90-days if you are dissatisfied with it (amazon only gives you 30-days, not nearly enough time to really evaluate a product; they should reconsider at least a 60-day return plan)."
2,Rather disappointing,"The author's first-hand knowledge of Papua New Guinea sustains this novel through roughly its first 50 pages, but sad to say, the remainder of the book is dragged to a slow death by its dreary narrative and truly unappealing characters (June Campbell in particular). A real disappointment given the intermittent flirtation with such significant themes as mortality and cultural warfare."
1,Let this one remain undiscovered.,"Adolescents, posing as intellectual parents, drag their unsuspecting daughter off to thier ruin in the New Guinea jungle.... A thoroughly miserable story from beginning to end. What is about the New Guinea jungle that makes writers sweaty? After reading this, we still don't know."
3,The Undiscovered Country,"June and Peter Campbell have taken their young daughter Taylor and left the cultured city of Boston for the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Peter expects to spend six months to a year conducting medical research among the Abini villagers for his PhD dissertation. June finances the expedition, hoping the trip will help repair their failing marriage. Once among the villagers, they are faced with the dangers of germs and diseases. Taylor runs free, joining the villager children and quickly picks up their language. June and Peter become more estranged and eventually alienate the villagers.Although the premise of the story is interesting, the characters are not very realistic. Their emotions tend to be flat and they are hard to relate to. The Abini setting is intriguing and I would have loved to have read more about their way of life. Instead they are presented in a stereotypical manner. Overall I rate this book 3 out of 5."
5,A masterpiece! Exquisite writing & a heartbreaking story.,"This extraordinary novel follows the Campbells, Peter, June and their young daughter Taylor, into the depths of Papua New Guinea. The story revolves around their experiences in the rainforest, the dissolution of a marriage and the integration of a young girl into the lives of the natives. An eerie, compelling book. Once inside the rainforest and the Campbell's story this novel is impossible to put down!"
4,Exquisite writing,"Lots of pure poetry in this book. Also she paints the lush landscape so the reader can see it and remember it. The characters are not traditional bravura types but rather real people who struggle and make mistakes and lose sometimes. If a reader is looking for a stereotypical role model, then this book won't provide that. Gillison gives an original look at Americans ill equipped for peril. GOOD READING."
3,"Historically interesting, but less visually stimulating than I'd hoped.","A good enough read, but I was really hoping for more visual support to the text. There are fewer photographs than I had hoped, and the ones that are there won't blow your mind. I suppose I was looking for more of a ""head to toe"" look at the second generation Range Rover, when this one focuses more on its development and technical specs."
3,"decent book, questionable vehicle","I bought this book to understand more about my 1999 4.6 HSE, which I bought a little more than a year ago. $8000 of repairs later, I can hardly stand to look at the car, or this book. That said, it gives a decent overview of the vehicle and the history & evolution of Range Rover. My advice to anybody considering a second generation? Buy the third generation, not this one."
1,Lousy Service,Chimney arrived in pieces. I don't know if was due to substandard packaging by the company or mishandling by the post office but either way I emailed the company about it and I never got a response so I'm not getting a favorable impression of them.
3,Smoked Montreal Beef Brisket,"I am fully satisfied with the brisket.There is only two reasons that I would like it better.#1 more fat on the meat, Pastrami with out fat just does not taste like pastrami#2 more broth so that I could make a pastrami dip."
5,"An Adventurous climax to the "" Powers that Be "" trilogy","In this book Anne McCaffrey has once again proventhat she is a master.Petabee once a slumbering ice ball,awoken by aterraforming process , performed miraculous healings andmade it known that it was sentient is once more in dangerwhen on their way to testify on Gal-3 Yanaba, Bunny, Diego,and Marmion d'Revers are kidnapped by space pirate Onidi Luchardthe ransom Petabee.Planet side sean is trying to handle the immigrants, hunters, and Drug companyies that were landed by themysterious PTS transport system."
1,Just grab some dolls and play house.,"This is where I gave up on Anne McCaffrey's writing. The books full of adventure that I loved as a kid have slowly morphed into sentimental soap operas that revolve around pregnancy, adorable babies, pretty marriages, children, the building of little towns, adorable grandchildren, cute fuzzy animals, more pregnancy... I just can't take it anymore. Nothing of consequence happens in this book, beyond successful colonization and breeding.And what kind of a name for a planet is ""Petaybee"", anyway?"
5,"one of the best bluegrass videos ever, and a rare timepiece","I've viewed this video many times, both for its many great performances as well as the historical significance. Many great stars in their prime, an excited and very interesting audience, and great commentary from the man who started bluegrass festivals, Carlton Haney. The audience shots are especially interesting, as it was a highly polarized time in America, yet the different factions blended together at a bluegrass event, and seemed to have a great time together. The Jimmy Martin and Ralph Stanley clips are alone worth the price, and their side musicians are especially notable. This is a rare gem... some of the earliest full-color bluegrass ever shot, from 1971 when bluegrass festivals were new and filled with soul and excitement."
1,Region 1 restriction,Why is this DVD (and many others only available in the U.S.) restricted to region 1? Does Time Life (and others) want to keep the bluegrass community neat and tiny? Why are people outside the U.S. and Canada not allowed to watch this dvd???
4,Works Better than What You're Using Now,"G.T. Water Products, Inc. MP100-3 Master Plunger, BlackBet you've been using one of those 'standard' pink rubber jobs with the wood handle and looking for another...because the handle separated...and you're thinking, 'why can't I just find a simple, straight forward plunger? Who wants to buy an odd looking plastic gadget like that?'Answer: People who have used one.This plunger works faster, more easily and more surely...especially if you have one of the newer low flush toilets that tend to stop up if you forget to use only one sheet of TP, or so it seems...than does your typical old style hardware variety.I took off one star because it probably won't last for more than a year, but at this price, why not order two so you will be prepared with a spare? Or one for each bath so you don't have to go hunting at an inopportune time. You'll save on shipping and be glad you did. That's what I did; ordered in different colors."
4,Easy Switch,"This is handy for turning on and off Christmas tree lights and decorations. It saves me from crawling under the tree!It has a simple foot switch that plugs into the outlet as well as the Christmas lights. The cord is a lot longer than I need, but I guess this is better than being too short. I try to hide it under the tree skirt, and this works alright.This step button makes it safe and fun for my young children to turn on the Christmas tree lights."
5,Works Great. Easy to use,"For what it does, this is an inexpensive tool! Not only can i use this for work (does height in feet) but also for bow hunting (horizontal range). this rangefinder is more accurate than the specs. not to mention that it's very easy to use & the red dot works so much better than cross hairs and you can see it in dim light."
1,Buy Bushnell Instead,"I have had a couple Bushnell rangefinders in the past but wanted to try another brand. Opti-logic touted their ""made in America"" quality. The Bushnell rangefinders provided significantly longer and more consistent ranges off of a variety of targets. I did not like the sight on the Opti-logic as it did not provide the complete head-up display information like Bushnell. The housing felt cheap and flimsy with the display panel reminding me of an old calculator. Don't waste your money, buy Bushnell or Nikon."
2,"Good service, poor product","The merchant was great with quick service, but the product was very flimsy. I wil be expecting to buy a replacement from another manufacturer when this one breaks."
1,Very disappointed!,"I am very disappointed with the quality of this truck. The whole thing is practically all plastic! We have had 2 tires break off in the 2 weeks we've had it. The manufacturer guarantees the parts but they don't fix it, they just send you a replacement part. I would definitely not recommend this truck-spend a little extra for something better quality!"
5,the best butt toning video!,"i've been doing this video since '93, and have not found a better one since. i came online to find it in dvd format. tragically i didnt find it. this is a no nonsense, right to the point 30 min video that if done regularly 3-4/week produces amazing results. i dont like alot of silly dance steps - i like to get my workout in fast. it really takes so little time but targets and isolates the muscle group so well that it really works. this video is why i still have a vhs player!!! thanks to this video i can wear a tiny bikini on the beach and look great."
5,NOT aerobics!,"Don't listen to the comments claiming this is an aerobic video.Like almost all toning videos, it does begin with a light aerobic warm-up, but it's not complicated and it's over with quickly. The rest of the video is standing glute work, such as squats and lunges, followed by mat work. I love Janis Saffell, she is upbeat and a little perky but not at all annoying.The mat work was really excellent. It contains a lot of exercises I've never seen that you can really feel in the back of your hips. This is definitely one of the better butt workouts out there. I own about 40 exercise videos, and this is the one I always look forward to doing.And it's not aerobics!"
1,I hate aerobics!,"From the description of this video and the customer reviews, I couldn't tell this tape was mainly aerobics. Most of the moves were really fast combo moves, I have a really hard time following this type of workout. From now on, I'm going to stick with Pilates and Yoga type workouts and weight training."
1,NA....,"The only reason why I peeped these dudes, was cuz they were on Stange Music label, you know the same as Tech N9ne, Kutt, Skatterman & Snug-Brim. These guys are by far the WORST on this label, seriously Strange needs to let them go."
2,Stick with Esham and ICP.,"What a disappointment. Mike E. Clark aka MEC made some beautiful music for ICP, but Project Deadman is as derivative of Esham and ICP as Master P is of 2Pac. Only 2 or 3 songs actually had something to say. The rest of them sound like every horrorcore cliche Prozak could think of. Sometimes Prozak's flow is exciting, but he never creates a distinctive persona. MEC goes the rap/rock route on this album. This style is already played, but this CD is even worse because the loud guitar riffs don't have any melody. They're melded together with a bunch of other unidentifiable synthesized sounds to create Phil Spector's Wall of Sound from Hell. The songs with Tech N9ne, Dayton Family, Bootleg, and MC Breed have some fire, earning this album 2 stars instead of one."
5,PDM,"I had been looking foward to this cd for awhile. As soon as I heard it I was addicted to it. There is really all kinds of songs on this disc. All of the songs are very entertaining. ""THE CROSS BETWEEN STEPHEN KING AND WES CRAVEN"" spitting lyrics very dark is exactly what I was looking foward to. The wicked rap I have been looking for was right here because I am far from wicked and at the end of the day this is stuff you can drift away too in your imaganation. Another thing I really love about this group is how they seem to connect with there fans. They are repping the UNDERGROUND. They are not unreachable and the music they make is just for us. The fans of the wicked style. Try it out and support the Project."
5,Mike E Clark = music genius,"I never have been a fan of Bedlam(Prozak's former group)...as a matter of fact I thought they were an awful excuse for music...but when the better rapper of the group Prozak teamed up with Mike E Clark producer of the 5 best ICP jokers cards, the classic 3 EP's and B/B(which should have been ONE cd)...it works perfectly In my opinion this album blows away ICP's latest jokers card(simply because nobody wants to hear ICP try to sing over cheesy Zug IZland music)...not only is this one of my favorite albums of 2004 within time it might be one of my favorite albums..."
5,very good horrorcore,"This CD is awesome, if your a juggalo or a fan of Bedlam, then let mike e. clark and prozak blow your minds."
5,Author's comments,"I am the author of Kana Pictographix. Understand I focus on one thing here: remembering the kana and it's associated sound. I don't cover writing technique or the history of the kana. In fact, my visual mnemonics have nothing to do with the etymological origins of the characters. I should also mention that I use American pronunciation because, well, I'm an American. I seem to have touched 'raw' nerve with some Brits on my pronunciation of 'rocket'. Keep a stiff upper lip, yeah?If you'd like to see samples of this and my new kanji works that include kanji, kana, stroke order and playful graphics, I recommend you visit my website, KanjiPictographix. Cheers."
3,"Not good, not bad.","The idea and concept are great, but the delivery of the product isn't the best if you are intending to use this to help with studying. some of the images are a bit of a stretch, but other are excellent. There are some great tips at the end of the book as well as reference charts on the front and back covers. Worth it's price."
2,Disappointed,The mnemonics used in this book don't work for me...in fact they are making it harder for me to remember. There are times when I don't even see the link between the Japanese character and the author mnemonic . The book is very small (palm sized). Not really worth the money
3,Disappointing,"I was quite excited at first when I bought this however I cant really recommend it because of some glaring and rather exasperating mistakes. For some inexplicable reason some of the pictographix (at least 10) emphasise the wrong sound for the kana which will surely confuse the student. For example the pictographix for the hiragana/katakana for Ra are ""Roger the rabbit"" and ""Rocket"" both emphasising ""Ro""! Thats just one of a few. There are some nice and memorable pictograhix however these mistakes detract from what could have been an excellent book."
3,not a a bad thing to have,I like these kind of memory aids...this one was good for a student of mine and it worked for him.if these kind of things work for you also check out the kanji memory set-up...
5,This book is a Godsend!,"Started learning Japanese this year and I was most concerned with being unable to master the two phonetic alphabets and the kanji system. A few weeks in and I've mastered both Hiragana and Katakana, putting me at least a month ahead of the class and leaving time to concentrate on vocabulary, listening skills, pronunciation and those blasted Chinese characters. One problem I found early was that some of the devices didn't stick in my head and made particular characters somewhat more difficult to remember. However, since I was already in that mindset, I realized I could create my own device that did work and the rest was a breeze. Used this in conjunction with ""Let's Learn Hiragana"" and ""Let's Learn Katakana"" to get some extra practice writing the characters and seeing usage in actual Japanese words. I would highly recommend all three to anyone wishing to learn Japanese."
5,A Must Have!,This pocket edition is absolutely an essential tool for a beginner to come up to speed in learning the japanese script. This booklet is easy to carry around in your shirt pocket and can be flipped through very easily and quickly. Michael Rowley has made it very easy to remember the Japanese language characters.
5,this book is amazing!!!,"this book rox!!!...it is only day two of studying the pictures and i have already mastered the hiragana...i was very skeptical and i thought it would collect dust on my shelf because i really don't like mnemonics for learning, but i decided to give it a shot and i'm totally sold!!!...i highly recommend it to both serious (like myself)and casual students of japanese...definitely worth the money...in fact, it's a bargain!!!...i promise you will NOT be dissapointed!!!"
2,Not What They Said,"Looks like a great product if you can get it to work. I purchased a Logic web cam, have a new 1.2 GHz computer and did everything the manual said, and I still can't get it to work. My image is very fuzzy and has lots of noise. It is taking a lot of time to set up but the operation of the product looks fairly simple. Over all not what I expected."
2,Not what the Advertise,I have a new PC and everything required and still have a fuzzy picture and lots of noise. Need a lot of setup time to make it work. Not what I expected.
4,Cast A Spell review,"When I bought this book I was new to the Craft. A lot of people interested in witchcraft seemed to be in it just for the spell work. This book gave me great guidance in this area. The purpose of witcraft was not just casting spells and working magic, but forming a relationship with the dieties that are. The author gave many safeguards in using spellwork wrongly by teaching us the right way of doing witchcraft. I enjoyed reading this book because I think it is a book all new witches should read. If the guidliness in this book were truly followed, witches would have a better foundation in which to build their spellwork. Before you can walk, you must first crawl, etc. First, learn the basics, then move into the areas of experimentation and magic. This book teaches you how."
5,The title tells it all,"There ARE *very important* things to know *before* you begin any serious spell working. Sadly, what most 'newbie-pagans' only want are the answers. They aren't patient enough, nor perhaps mature or smart enough, to realise that first you have to know how to ask the questions. (I recommend they read Aesop's fable, ""The Tortoise and the Hare"") The book is well laid out and appropriately informative."
1,Title is Deceiving,"A more appropriate title would be ""Before You Cast a Spell: Understanding ethics."" He doesn't get into writing spells at all. He explains nothing about how power works, and what's worse, it comes across that he doesn't even really believe in magik at all... There's nothing worse than trying to learn something from someone who doesn't believe what they are teaching.He's extremely preachy on ethics, to the point where it gets irritating. And the other reviewers are right in that he is most definately on a high horse.I was mainly disappointed because I thought this book might actually get into how magik works, how to write your own spells, and stuff like that. IT NEVER DOES. EVER.I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. If you want a book about how to write your own spells try ""Your Book Of Shadows: How to Write Your Own Magickal Spells"" by Patricia Telesco."
3,Good For Beginners?,"As much as I loathe the author, he actually makes some good points for beginners in magick. The one setback is having to read through why this guy thinks he's freakin' Superman before you get any real info. All in all, the info's there you just have to hunt for it."
5,Great Resource,"This book is a must have for anyone researching their family roots back to the 16th century Jamestown, VA area. A wealth of information on the settlers and their origins."
4,A solid sourcebook,"A note: If you are playing Third Edition Shadowrun and don't feel like collecting old source material, skip this book completely (it is replaced by a newer sourcebook, as is its companion, Fields of Fire).That said: Unlike some of the later sourcebooks, most things here are actually useful while not being overpowered. In addition, it gives a better range of items to choose from within a class (for example, you're not limited to only 4 light pistols).If you are looking for more toys for your compaign, get this book. If you prefer a better idea of how to play a Street Samurai, don't look here. There's almost nothing on tips or hints in this book. Cybertechnology and Fields of Fire are much more useful for the hows and whys of playing street sams."
4,"A very, very good book.But below my expectations.",The street samurai catalog was full of weapons reviews. This helps a lot because now i can give my characters much better gear.
3,Some water damage,"Limited water damage, but I figure it's a secondhand book. No complaints about the interior--in fine order all and all."
3,Book review,This book is okay and has some interesting weaponry. I expected more from a Shadowrun book. It is helpful for Shadowrunners playing third edition.
3,"Good book, but expected more","This book is written more from advertisers point of view, and seems to be a quite relistic catalog. The quotes are great and i like them, but i wanted more information. it gave general information, but not how everthing worked."
3,Hard to Review,"If I were going to review this after the first 80 pages or so, I would have given it an enthusiastic (perhaps zealous) 5 stars. Within those pages are contained a great deal of beauty, enough so that I will go out and find other things by Saramago.Having kept going, though, I started to get bogged down in the slow-moving story. There is a lot here to enjoy, but every time that I pick this up, I feel as though I get trapped in quicksand, and I just can't make it through. The farther I get, the faster I get bogged down. I finally made it through, but it certainly took longer than it should have. The Travelogue aspect of the story was undesirable, and not something that I wanted to continue reading.Harkius"
4,High quality phone case.,"it's a little bulky, but very well built. It is too small for the phone I intended it for (and was listed as it was for my phone) a Casio Brigade. It fits too tight and continually pushes the buttons. I will likely find another use for this case."
2,NOT HAPPY,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY HUSBAND AS HE IS OUT ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME AND HE KEEPS IT ON HIS BELT. ONE DAY MY HUSBAND BENT OVER AND THE PHONE FELL OUT OF THE CASE AND THE ANTENNA BROKE AND WE HAVE BEEN HAVING NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE SINCE THEN AND NOW NEED TO BUY A NEW PHONE. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED
5,Great for Beginners,This book is one of the best books I have read for beginners are even those that have to step back and review what they have learned to help them on their journey.I have been practicing since Yule. Here a few weeks ago I was at a stand still and once I picked up this book I was able to understand things better then when I first started. The Author explains things such as the book of shadows really well and also teaches you how to do a basic meditation. I feel everyone sould read this book.
2,"Amazingly objective tone, but....","If you want to know the history of the Craft, don't read this book. It has one citation, and that is to The Encyclopedia of the Occult. And that, even, was just to correct her previous histories where she just spat out commonly repeated claims of the Pagan community. Just think before you read. If you want the commonly repeated misonceptions of the Pagan community repeated to you, this book is a good read then!"
5,Relaxing,Since putting this up in my backyard I've hardly been able to get near it - all my friends and relatives love it. Just make sure you install it properly - a hammock attached to a tree looks good but if it can't bear the weight compromise on solid posts (paint them or plant a tree in front of them to make them look better).
4,"Nice item, but wood cant handle the weather","This is a nice, quality item, just a couple small beefs: I guess I should expect this, but the wood part of the unit is starting to get weathered. Maybe theres another hammock that has a different type of wood, or finish, or doesnt use wood at all. Its not a huge deal, but its not quite as pretty as it was when we got it. Also, the fabric part is getting a little moldy, which is of course my fault, but it would be nice if it were easier to disassemble and throw in the wash.Bottom line, this is a great product if you take care of it :)"
1,Do not buy this item....I wasted my money....don't waste yours!,"DO NOT BUY THIS HAMMOCK! I purchased this item in September 2011, by March of this year (2012), it was not usable. The green and white side looks fine, but the solid green side literally disintegrated into a green powder. Keep in mind it was not chewed on by a dog, played on by a child, eaten by insects or mistreated in any way. I can't explain why a fabric would do this and I have never seen it happen before. Spend your $149 on something that you will be able to actually use in 6 months. Very, very, very disappointed as this should have lasted at least a couple years!"
5,Love These Shoes!,"These are absolutely the most comfortable and lightweight shoes I have ever worn. I have these in several colors, and will continue to buy them. The only thing that I would change is to make the white on the soles the same color as the rest of the shoe, but the only time that has prevented me from buying the shoe is when looking for black shoes to wear as part of a uniform."
5,Happy Customer,"I am 73 years old and the only one in my family that has a narrow foot (7.5 AA). Most of my children and grandchildren have purchased mules from local shoe stores with satisfactory results. Of course I have visited every shoe store in my surrounding area to find that all mules sold are sized B or wider. So, I finally decided to try the internet and recently purchased Travel Time Bronze/White Mules. As soon as they arrived I knew by looking at them they were going to fit - and fit they did! They are by far the most comfortable shoes I have bought in a long time. I am now in the process of buying another pair - blue/white. Thank heavens for the internet and Amazon.com.Easy Spirit Women's Traveltime Sneaker"
5,Comfort,"These are great, and confortible to wear. Got as I have a heel spur on the bottom of my foot and it helps with the pain. I have 4 pairs of these Easy Spirit travel-time clogs and just love them."
4,loved them out of the box,comfortable out of the box. fit great and look good. i would recommend them for comfort plus the price was great
4,Comfy,"I wear these when I visit my parents' ranch. I am used to flip flops but out in the country where there are snakes... closed-toe shoes are kind of a necessity. They're VERY comfortable and fit great, and I can slide them right on and go. Very nice material and well made."
3,shiny shoes,"ah, these are stiff and not so comfortable. the all cloth are better, looks like I'm wearing boots, don't like"
5,Third Pair,This is the third pair of this exact shoe that I've ordered. It is so comfortable and I get compliments on them.I would recommend them to anyone that needs a comfortable attractive shoe.
4,Comfort travel shoes,Attractive and comfortable very light weight . . .Wider than anticipated and sizing a bit generous.I will buy another color shortly.
3,blue?,"Beware...Darkest blue ever, almost black. Don't know if wrong color was sent or that the picture does not represent the true color."
1,easy spirit traveltime black and silver shoe,I have three other pair of easy spirits and I live in them so I ordered this pair on line since I am well aware of this product.The shoes were a little shorter than my others and the patent strip on the top of the right foot cut into my foot and I was miserable. Very disappointed.
5,Great shoes,I have had foot surgery. I wore these shoes to my doctors appointment and he was impressed with the support that they gave me. Love them.
5,LOVE!!! the Easy Spirit shoes,"I bought these for my wife and she loves the style, fit, feel, and comfort of the shoes. We'd both strongly recomend them for everyone."
5,"Great shoe, ordered wrong size","This looked like a terrific shoe, but was the wrong size. I think I would rather try on in a store from now on instead of waiting for delivery, paying for a return, and waiting for the next size. I would order from the net no problem if I was sure of the size."
5,plantar fasciitis relief,I have severe pain from plantar fasciitis and this shoe is the only kind I can wear without making my pain worse. I have four colors and love them. My heels feel so much better in these shoes. I wear them all the time- even in the house because they feel so much better than slippers or barefoot.
5,Love These Comfortable Shoes!!!,"Have these in several colors and they've become front and center on my shoe rack. They fit like a glove, provide arch support, are so lightweight I forget I have them on, and they stay on my feet without any slipping whatsoever.Do some volunteer work which involves being on my feet for several hours at a time and these are my shoes of choice. Even wear them with socks in winter snow unless it's over 1-1/2"" or so."
4,comfortable but not perfect,It's a nice comfy shoe. I wish it would have a shaped insoleas some others do. I only wear it with socks as feet get totsweaty without them..Nice style.
3,Not quite what I expected,"When I first wore these, they were somewhat tight, but it wasn't long before they spread out. Also, they do not have an arch support. I will wear them around the house, but if I need to walk any distance, I will change to other walking shoes, even if it's to go to the store. I would not order these again."
5,east spirit slip on's,love them. they are so comfortable. I have feet problems and they help alot.I would recommend these to anyone with or without feet problems.
1,Easy Spirit Slip on Navy Suede Shoe Size 9,The shoe I ordered was navy and the shoe is black and the lining is blue! The shoe is so wide it wants to slip. I am very disappointed and will return.
3,Easy Spirit Traveltime Shoes,"Took on a trip, but needed some break-in time. Caused some discomfort on my bunion. But I am sure they will be fine because I have two other pairs that I love."
5,Nice shoe,Great shoe! Love the fact that it's a slip on. You slide on slippery surfaces though so be careful. Overall very happy!
5,So comfy,"I loved these so much that after a week I ordered a second pair in another color. These are the most comfy and easy to wear sneaker/mule I've found. Perfect to slip on to run errands, perfect for airline travel (easy on/off) and perfect for a day of sight seeing."
5,Easy Comfort is COMFORT!,"I have been wearing Easy Comfort sandals, sneakers, slip ons for year...I seek them out, especially on sale as they are a little pricey. However, if I cannot find them on sale I buy them anyway! My feet have to bear the constant weight of my entire body and nothing is worse than sore feet! I can be walking, working out or wearing dress shoes all day and my feet never hurt....worth every penny! Thanks, Easy Comfort!"
5,As comfy as a slipper,"I recently bought a pair of the black and silver to wear with a black pant suit for my niece's wedding. Since I would be on my feet all day, I needed a comfy good looking shoe. For the price, these were an excellent choice. They fit well, are easy to walk in, and I love that they come in a wide width. I added a black velvet clip on bow with rhinestones to make them a little more dressy. I was the envy of the bridal party and everyone else hobbling around in high heels."
5,Pink and Purple Traveltime Mule,"True to size, very comfortable, the color (I love it) is just like the picture. I wish all my sneakers felt as good on my feet as these do. And I will buy more if they come on sale."
5,Most Comfortable Shoe Ever,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned in my life! (pushing the big 5-0). There is the reason that they are in 845th place of apparel on Amazon. I got the green/olive pair. They run true to size. I've decided to buy more in the other colors. I use them as advertised, for light walking. I wouldn't use them to exercise in, but for casual walking, they're great. Good job, Easy Spirit!"
5,Love these shoes!,I love these shoes. They feel like you're walking on air. So comfortable. I can wear them all day shopping 'til I'm dropping and my feet are not miserable at the end of the day.
2,different fit from others,i have 2 pairs of the same shoe in blue and beige. This one fit wide and was sloppy on my foot
5,"Finally, a shoe for everyday!","I suffer with many foot issues and have wasted my money on cheap fixes that never fix. I decided to try a mid priced shoe and this is it! I absolutely love the comfort, the arch isn't too high, and for the first time I don't have to wear socks to keep from sweating. They have wide width, that I have to have. These shoes are a must for anyone who doesn't like to wear shoes, but when they have to these are the go to shoes!"
5,"Love, love, love my new shoes",I have a pair of sketchers that are similar to these and wanted to replace them so I'd have a newer pair. I was so pleased to find these at Amazon.com on line and love them! Jan
5,great shoe,I love this shoe. It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever had. I am 70 years old & must have comfortable shoes to stay on my feet for any length of time. I love the easy way it slips on. Great for travel but great for us oldies that need ease of use. I take a wide & it fit perfectly.
5,Great for narrow feet...hurray!,"I bought these shoes at an Easy Spirit outlet store (for, ahem, more money than they cost here on Amazon). I chose the blue upper with a gray bottom in a narrow width. I absolutely love them. Comfy from Day 1, and nicely styled. The blue is perfect to wear with jeans (it's not so bright that it stands out, it's more of a grayish blue). I've been wearing Merrell Primo Breeze shoes for years, and never thought I'd find another pair of slip-ons that are as comfortable or that offered as much support. Easy Spirit has won me over, am I'm not an easy customer (I'm sure others with narrow, picky feet will relate). You can probably find similar shoes that are cheaper, but they won't feel as close to heaven as these do... You definitely will not regret this purchase."
4,Comfortable,"Love these shoes! I recently purchased a pair in green and loved them so much that when i saw they were on sale at Amazon for 50% less than I paid for the first pair elsewhere, i HAD to have them!"
5,"Perfect size, soooo comfortable","These are definitely the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I have some problems with foot pain and I always have a lot of trouble finding any kind of shoe that fits correctly (size 10.5M), and these fit absolutely perfectly and feel great. They actually look pretty cute too and don't make my feet look big. They were here in a couple of days, and I've worn them all day every day since then! I'm ordering other colors now for a vacation trip where we'll be doing a lot of walking -- and now I know I'll be comfortable. I also like the easy on and off at the airport security with this slip-on shoe. Amazon rules!!!!"
3,Quality slipping,These were bought to replace ES slip ons I've been wearing for a while. It was easy to tell the quality was not as good.
5,So comfortable!,On my second pair of these great shoes. Just had to have them in white to wear with any casual outfit.
5,Great slip-on shoe,"I have these in several colors. They are so comfortable to wear. My feet swell alot and these make it easy to at least wear a shoe, with or without socks."
5,What you see is what you get,Shoes were delivered quickly and in great condition. Great for summer if this is your kind of style. I bought these for my mother and she looks pretty sharp in them. Good comfort and traction.
2,easy spirit traveltime mule,"Love everything about the shoe, except it feels that it is composed of somewhat inferior materials. Not as comfortable as I thought. I've had better comfort with LL Bean mules.The color and design is appealing, but comfort level has a way to go."
5,Perfect fit,Love my Easy Spirits..perfect fit and for my 10N..not easy to find! Wish I had half-a-dozen pair!
4,Love these shoes,"These came in my exact size, 9 1/2 narrow which was a rare pleasure. They are comfortable and easy to wear. Very happy I got them."
1,Not so comfortable shoe,"This is a nice looking shoe but after awhile, about an hour, my feet start to hurt. I thought from the others reviews that this would be an excellent comfortable shoe but not so for me."
3,Not as Comfortable as other Traveltime shoes,My first consideration in shoes is always comfort and for this reason I love the Traveltime shoe line. I own many different styles. This is my least favorite because the material doesn't breathe or move which makes the shoes uncomfortable. I also had to use a magic marker on the silver dots which I think look tacky.
3,comfortable,These shoes prove to be comfortable for my 2 mile walks in the morning...Can't say a lot for the color (except it goes with my survivor emblem on shorts)..
5,Great casual sneaker,"This is my second pair of Easy Spirit Traveltime Slip-On sneakers. I have bunions and need a shoe with a wide toes box. This fits perfectly. It is wide enough to be comfortable, but my foot doesn't slide out of it like with some other slip-on shoes. Highly recommended."
1,Omission on the description - sent them back!,The description never told the height of the front of the shoe - just the heel. All other easy spirit shoes say 'flat'. The description said 1 1/4 heel and nothing about the font of the shoe and it didn't say flat. THEY ARE FLAT. I sent them back. I wish Easy Spirit would remake the Travel Time High shoes. They are the best for me.
5,recomended!,"Was introduced to these shows summer of 2009 by family member. Softest shoe I had ever stepped in to! fit like a glove so no slipping off. Very light weight. Easy care. I wash them and set them out to dry. My oldest pair I use for yard work because they can get wet and not slip, get dirty and be cleaned easily, I just LOVE my Traveltimes! I can order my size and not worry aabout them not fitting correctly."
4,E-Z Spirit Travel Time Shoes,These shoes have been a favorite of mine for years now and the new pair still meets expectations. They are large and comfortable enough to accommodate bunions and sensitive feet. Custom orthopedics can also be added for more comfort.
3,Didn't last long,"I loved these while they lasted - very comfortable and my ""go-to"" shoe. However, they didn't even last a year before my big toe went through the mesh then ripped through the swede. I keep my toenails short so this shouldn't have happened and has not happened with any of my other shoes. A $45 shoe that only lasts for 10 months or so is very disappointing."
5,Easy Spirit Women's Traveltime Mule,Very comfortable - I have 5 pair in all colors. Orthodic inserts fit beautifully. I just purchased the latest style in navy suede with fleece lining for winter.
5,Great shoe,I bought this shoe for travel that will involve a lot of walking. I have been trying them and are completely satisfied and sure I will take them on my trip. They are extremely comfortable and would be great for travel.
3,Traveltime Mules not really good for traveling/walking.,"While comfortable to wear,I found I could not walk comfortably in these shoes. I walked right out of them on slight inclines! Also, I do not think they are true to size as I was standing on the heel ridge rather than it being behind my heel. Could be that Mules are not for me, and I'll try other Easy Spirit shoes. I was disappointed in the fit, however, after I read all the other raving reviews."
3,"Not the greatest, but acceptable","I have hand/foot syndrome from chemo, which means that my feet get very sensitive, hot and irritated. I need very comfortable shoes. These are average. To me, they are not as comfortable as everyone claims, but it could just be because I don't have average feet. I normally wear a 9.5M. I bought a 10M and they just fit and are quite snug. If I were wearing thick socks, they would be uncomfortable. They do look nice and I have gotten compliments on them. I will keep them for Summer wear when I'm wearing thinner socks than normal. I guess if you're looking for super comfort, you are going to have to cough up the big bucks for the pricier shoes."
3,"Very nice idea, but slippery","I am a 54 year old woman and I bought these to wear this summer. They are extremely comfortable, but you can't walk on linoleum with them if the floor is wet--these shoes are SLIPPERY. I found this out at home in the kitchen when I was washing dishes. So I know I can't wear them anywhere if it is raining or snowing, because if I enter a store with them, it's very likely I'll slip and fall."
4,bought for mom,Bought these for my mom who has foot problems and she loves them. Raved about how comfortable they are.
5,most comfortable walking shoes,"I have 4 pairs of these shoes in 4 different colors. The minute I tried these on I was hooked! These shoes were so comfortable right from the start. My feet never hurt in these. I have difficulty finding comfortable shoes- I have bunions and need a good arch support. Most of the time my feet end up hurting by the end of the day but not in these. My favorite is black and they go with most winter outfits. I got a light gray color for summer but I wore them so much they really became dirty, so for me I'll pick darker colors. The brown herringbone style is very nice too. These shoes are highly recommended by me."
5,So comfortable!,I love these shoes. I have bought them in three colors. They don't slip like many other mules because the insteps grip my feet. Never any rubbing on my heels. I wear them to walk my dogs and just everywhere.
5,Great shoes,"Uncertain about the size, the free return shipping convinced me to order.So glad I did!Dislike shoelaces so the style was great, so was the look and color . I could wear these every day.Now I just need some great looking socks to wear all year round."
5,Loved it!!!!,Thank you so much...this book was better than described. I apologize its taken me so long to review this...I thought I already had done this...I am so sorry. DUH!! Loved the books and will return to you again to buy more...thanks again.....AAAAAAAA+++++++ Pat
4,Fun in the sun,"A great way to decorate your yard or patio. The design is really fun, and the sundail actually works. Put it in a spot with plenty of all day light, and you will be able to tell time without a watch. I also really liked that it can be used as a bird feeder or bath, as well as just a sun dial."
1,Unpleasant surprise,"When I opened the package I was very pleased with the quality of the sundial...it has a pretty design, nice color and finish, etc. After only 2 weeks in the garden there are already rust spots on the raised parts of the design. Buyer beware!"
2,Not The Original,"I awaited this cd in anticipation of hearing the silky sounds of Teddy Pendergrass. However, none of the songs are the original arrangements and his voice does not sound the same as I remembered 20 something years ago. I was very disappointed..."
1,By the original recordings!,"As a huge TP fan I must say that this album is both musically and vocally flat! I had a hard time even believing that this was Teddy Pendergrass singing. If you want to hear original Teddy, do not purchase this CD. You will be disappointed!"
2,Not The Original,"I awaited this cd in anticipation of hearing the silky sounds of Teddy Pendergrass. However, none of the songs are the original arrangements and his voice does not sound the same as I remembered 20 something years ago. I was very disappointed and I felt ripped off."
2,Re-recorded material & remixes: No Contest 4 The Originals!,"I was thinking I was buying a greatest hits with some modern day remixes of some classic R&B. At first I thought I just had not heard the song in a while. Then I heard Close The Door and realized that this is re-recorded material. Sorry to say, it was not very good. Close The Door is a slower rendition of it's original conterpart and is missing the feel of it. The remixes are weak, they sound ""textbook-ish"". They do not strike me as ""inspired"" or ""creative"" but rather thrown together because remixing is the big thing now. I am afraid if they had been of the original recordings, they would have not done them justice.If you want Teddy in all his 70's and early 80's glory, you owe it to yourself to pick up the re-issues of his original albums re-issued on Right Stuff."
1,AWFUL!!!!,"If you expect to hear the original recordings, you will be very disappointed. Each song has been ""remastered"" or ""remixed"". They sound nothing like the originals. VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS CD."
2,Doesn't work unless wood is perfectly smooth,"I tried this product with the 3M outdoor clear film to try to insulate the windows in my heated barn. Within two days after installation all the film and tape was on the ground. The wood trim around the windows was ship-lap (painted, but was somewhat rough on the surface)... this double sided tape did not adhere to the surface and in a day or two peeled away from the wood trim and end up hanging or on the ground."
5,super stron,I also purchased this item last year to use to enclose a screened in porch. The tape held up against 30-40mph winds that we had in the fall. Tough stuff. I highly recommend it.
4,Sticky business,"Works just as advertised. Has stood up to to stiff winter winds, much better than the indoor tape I tried last year."
1,Unfortunate for the poor trees who contributed to this book,"The only reason I have this book is because my company funded a course taught by the author. Unfortunately the content of the book is so academic that it is completely unrealistic in the real world. While you can use Object Oriented approaches for many things, I think gathering requirements should be done differently. The problem with his approach is you immediately jump to design before any analysis and could easily call into object hell right out of the gate."
5,a fast and easy lunch or dinner,"I got these for my husband to take to work with him for those long, hectic days where he needs a quick snack. I also like to mix this with some veggies for a healthy and satisfying lunch or dinner. Very good!"
