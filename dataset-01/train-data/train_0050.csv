3,Undying certainly isn't Jericho,"I read somewhere that this game was better than Jericho. Well, Jericho's graphics and game play are spectacular; this game is not. Undying seems to only play on XP while Jericho will play on Windows Vista and Windows 7. I played it for a short while and it was reminiscent of Nosferatu."
3,Awesome Sound!,What a voice! Joe Diffe has been compared with the great Eddie Arnold for the smooth and controlled way he sings his songs. I love hearing him.I feel that all CD's are over-priced though and for that reason I give only three stars.
2,What were they thinking,"I love BBC and A&E Series My all time favorite series Pride and Predijudice, was a major hit. But I honestly don't get where they were going with this series. I was diasppointed in the quality and this is not a movie I would share with the whole family"
5,Wonderful action. Superb acting,"It is a joy to follow Horatio Hornblower's ""journey"" as a young officer in HM Navy. From the beginning it is clear that HH is more than just one of the ""young gentlemen"". His ingenuity and wits makes him stand out from the rest. He succeeds in doing his duty using his abilities in a way which gains him the trust and admiration of the men above and below him.Ioan Gruffudd's performance as Horatio Hornblower and Robert Lindsay as Capt. Pellew are indeed outstanding, as well as the rest of the cast.Part 5 and 6 let you see how much more HH has grown into his role as a leader. David Warner as the quite insane Capt. Sawyer is brilliant.A MUSTSEE ! But beware, it can become an addiction........."
2,What a disapointment :(,Didnt like this series at all ... cheap production very disapointed.... would send back if I could ....would cost me too much in postage ... dont buy :(
5,an absolute must-buy!,"It is very rare that an adaptation of a beloved book series is wonderful in its own right, but these A&E films absolutely are! Partly this has to do with inspired casting--across the board the actors are excellent, and the choice of Ioan Gruffudd is really terrific. He looks, acts, feels the part of Hornblower, and lends depth and complexity to the endeavor. As well, the attention and care paid to the ships themselves, the sea-battles, the feel of the ocean is not like anything I've seen on television. Watching the DVD's, it is easy to forget that this was a television production (except for the telltale fades which mark commercial breaks.) I've already watched the whole series several times and have hooked various family members, who are now fans. I just hope that A&E, or someone else will consider continuing the series, since the eight episodes in existence end at the point where Hornblower's life only becomes more interesting."
3,Not the best effort I've read...,"The short code snippets are horrible. If the author wants to save money and space by using code snippets, it should be checked and checked again for accuracy. There are numerous errors in the code. For example, on page 80, there is an example of condition variable usage. However, there are no function prototypes! This is just one of numerous obvious ommissions. Trust me, there are non-obvious errors too. If you're looking for an overview, this will do you fine. However, if you're looking for some decent code examples to look at, I'd suggest Butenhof's book instead.Multi-threaded programming is difficult enough, why make it harder for yourself?"
4,Pretty good book,"I used soe of it , and did not finish reading , but considered a good start in addition to teh website that talks more with exmaples abut using teh pthreads"
4,"Good book, covering the basics","This is a nice book, very clear and covers lots of important points. But it there is much more to learn about te architecture of threaded programs (books on concurrent or parallel programming may help), and there also are synchronization primitives not covered in the book (barriers and semaphores).Anyway, it's a nice first threads book for someone who already knows C."
5,Great Little Tool Holder !,"There are 2 things I carry on my belt everyday on the job, My cell phone and this little pouch with a Gerber tool and my utility knife. I have only 2 small gripes, I wish that the back pad was a bit stiffer because my pouch has sagged a bit, and that there was a double layer at the bottom of the 2 tool holders because mine has now worn a hole in the bottom of both holders. With that said, It's hard to compain when the item is only 5 bucks and mine has remained faithful for 2 years!!"
2,Go for Pope's Instead,"The Pope's Ultimate Double Tool Holster is phenomenal. This holster is very aesthetically pleasing and has quite nostalgic feel to it. It is quite durable and fits a small flashlight and multi-tool very securely. The craftsmanship is excellent. Although the clasp is not as functional as I would like it to be, if you're looking for a well made, nostalgic looking holster, this product is a sure way to get some compliments."
1,Great Drywall Aid,"In addition to the drywall screw bag, you always need your pencil, razor knife, phillips screwdriver and black marker. This handy sheath hooks to the front of the screw bag or onto your belt to keep these items at your fingertips. Really worththe cost!"
4,Awesome for Word Study,"I bought this to help me with word study in my classroom. I teach 6th grade reading and English to students who are struggling in those areas. Part of our IIP at school is to teach about 10 different prefixes per grade level. I actually needed to purchase this green book and the red prefix book, to get all the prefixes I needed. Anyways, the purchase has been well worth it. It has about 5 actvities/worksheets per prefix, plus a quiz. Usually when I buy books like this I end up modifying everything, but not this time. I really like what is in here. Well worth the money, saves me time from creating the material myself and the kids have learned so much! They are applying what was learned in previous lessons to new lessons. These series of books were actually recommended to me by another teacher in my district. She loves them too."
3,Good but it would be a lot of paper to copy,More activities and opportunities to work with the prefixes would help. There are no exercises for use in sentences or in writing.
5,Great for Special Ed.,"This presents the prefixes and suffixes into small chunks so as to not overwhelm the students. Gives a great multiple choice practice, as well as many examples."
4,Nice film,"This film's animation was lacking with the character's facial expressions. However, it worked! I really enjoyed this film. It has a simple, yet charming quality to it. There isn't much said, but it has a beautiful message. The backgrounds are interesting at times, and the characters just look like dolls, but this add's more interest to the film. The only problem is that for the dvd I felt they should have inhanced the color/picture quality. Very faded, and warn looking. The extra feature is a George Pal short of John Henry and the Inky Poo. You can find George Pal on DVD on Amazon.com, and his Puppetoons.So in the long run I really enjoyed this stop frame animation film."
2,emperor and the nightingale,The claymation on this is wonderful but my kids could not stay interested in it.
4,good book for failures,can you send this book for my testing purpose please send me the details if possiable. or it is available to buy from mumbai-Thane ( india) i am interesting to buy this book asap.Thanks and regards.
1,BEWARE CUT AT WRONG SPEED,"How they could release such a great, classic outstanding concert, which even Reed called 'a night of pure heaven' (or something like that) at the wrong speed is beyond me. You have to transfer this to cassette and then re-dubb it with the pitch at correct speed. Yea, the boot CD is better, hard to find."
4,VU REUNION: ONE NIGHT ONLY!!! History was made in Paris '72,"I've heard it and I've read yr reviews and here's my take. Short and sweet, yeah the sound quality is good-fair but people, music-phlies, Reed, Cale and VU fans unite...this was history and I've heard worse sound quality recordings. It's the performances that make this CD. Reed & Cale are incredible. Nico holds her own but some of her stuff just isn't for me. If yr on the fence and debating whether of not to buy this CD, ask yrself this question--are you a die hard Lou Reed, Cale & VU head? If you are, then Bataclan 72 is a must for you."
4,A Classic Concert,"I'm glad they finally released this. Its only been available on bootleg and to hear it remastered must be a treat. Most of the album is basically the Velvet Underground Unplugged. However, get it for the Nico songs. Aside from an ep of Peel Sessions which are not really live anyway, this is the only way to hear classic Nico songs live. And anyway, the band as a whole shines. This was one of those special one of a kind concerts, not to be repeated."
2,A Great Disappointment,"After looking forward to this recording with much fervor, I was very disappointed to hear the final result. The sound quality throughout is poor (the mike shorts out during Lou Reed's ""Berlin,"" for which the liner notes apoligize), but other tracks are muddy, too, especially the encore, ""All Tomorrow's Parties,"" which is further ruined by the voice of a woman offstage taking during the performance. Also, Nico suffers from an embarrasingly long coughing fit after she finishes ""Janitor of Lunacy."" Each of the trio have about one good song each (""Waiting for the Man,"" ""Ghost Story,"" and ""Femme Fatale""). The two ""Bonus Tracks"" are an insult to the consumer, just throwaway pieces that are not even complete songs, badly recorded. Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one. The letdown of the year, and it's only Februrary!"
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"Okay, this show was excellent, very touching and intimate... beautifully sung... but I don't know what they did to the recordings! The voices are ""low-pitched"", and if you hear the original bootlegs (or even better, if you have the chance to catch the filmed version of it), you will soon notice that on this cd, the whole stuff is slower and the voices are lower. Reed and Nico may have already low voices but this is really annoying! Who wants to hear ""Femme Fatale"" in another key than the original one?I payed for it quite an expensive price, this cd being available only in import here in France, and felt like I was cheated. It's a real shame that some people will discover this show only by listening to this. Better stick to your old bootlegs... ;op"
4,But where is?,"Yes its a great cd crammed full of great tunes but where is ""Do you know what i mean"" ( a number one and Oasis highlight). I know Noel hates Be Here Now (not a good album for sure but this song was a monster. Not a single track from this third album made it on the cd) Theres plenty of Top 5 and number ones that also didnt make it but this one songs omission is to me unbelievable. Oh well- as other reviewers have said its all good stuff but those looking to get all the essential Oasis will have to wait for a boxset or a later compilation- ps the japan issue adds ""roll with it"" and ""let there be love"" but still no ""know what i mean""."
5,BEST ROCK BAND EVER!,"All I can say is WOW! I've crunk this cd so many times, especially Morning Glory. I can't seem to get the volume high enough. That song is perfect for the summer time at the beach, having a great time with friends! Every song is a hit and showcases real talent, the Gallagher boys do us Irish lads proud!"
5,Decent disc for those that just want one Oasis album.,"I can whine and moan and complain like other reviewers about which songs should have been included but were skipped or that Be Here Now was omitted altogether from this compilation, but everyone has to understand that this CD is merely a concise sampler of Oasis's career from 1994 - 2006. People that are interested in buying this CD probably don't want to own an Oasis album and simply want to own the songs they heard playing on the radio back in the 90s or are trying to see if spending money on Oasis's back catalog is ""worth it"" from a sampling of their career. If either is the case, this CD will suffice. It includes many songs that showcase why Oasis was one of the most popular British rock bands in recent history and, since most of the songs come from their strongest albums, will give buyers their money's worth. Enjoy!"
1,Laziness,Does the band have any input in this. My first complaint is each disc only has nine tracks. Why not fill it up? Stop Crying My Heart Out should be on there as well as Do You Know What I Mean? There was at least seven other tracks they could have included. Why release two discs with nine tracks only on them? It makes no sense.
2,OASIS IV BETTA VAN VUH BE-OHS,"Cor, eh-e-un wif eh-e senz noz at Oasis iv betta van vuh Be-ohs. Vey iz moy inspa-a-shun, yeh? De Be-ohs kent old uh kendo to me mayts in Oasis!"
3,Good for those of you trying to weane yourself from Windows.,"This is not a very bad book but it is extremely outdated. Caldera v2.3 is the newest version and as the reviewer below stated...download that version to use.I find this a nice guide for those of you that would like to try Linux for the first time and are either wanting to get away from Windows products or are even trying out a OS for the first time ever.It is a visual guide as stated, in color, yet the newer Caldera will allow you to skip all the X terminal and command line prompt garbage in the first few chapters, so you can jump straight to KDE pretty much.Caldera is not the most popular distro of Linux available, but it is a nice start for the beginner and this book will tell you enough to give you a working knowledge of the GUI functions it has using the KDE interface....Even still, this a decent price for a starter kit.Not that great...but definitely serviceable."
5,Great book !,I had this book in college and then it got packed away and I can't find it. It is the best book I used for Biology so I got another one just to brush up on it. Lots of great information. You can't go wrong with this book.
5,"biology, 6th edition/campbell/reece",The book arrived in just a few days and in very good condition. The price was so affordable. I would definitely order from them again.
4,College Standard,This book set the bar for general bio classes. I've seen this text used in high school AP bio classes as well as many college bio classes. It is well organized and provides an great explanation for things you need to understand. The picture help to further understanding.
4,satisfactory,"i ordered it from the new section and the book, when i received it, had some pages highlighted and the cd that came with the book was already opened."
3,Book condiiton different as advertised,Book advertised as new but a used one was received. A discount was later given after exchanges of several emails directly with the seller.
1,Some sellers considered used items as new - Interesting,"When I'm buying a new item, I'm expecting a book in pristine condition and not a book with highlighted pages and with the spoiled corners. Only one advice: do not trust the vendor."
3,excellent book...,"excellent book, but overly superfluous ...there is jargon everywhere...I'm the type that wants a book to get to the point and be professional... much like a russian style rote testbookthis book does have one strength (it can beat into the minds with lower I.Q.s, what other professional texts can't)"
3,3 stars,"I think this book contains some unneccessary details, which is a waste of time for students. Other than that, it's a good book."
4,Great book,Book was almost in new condtion when I received it and the price so low. I will defintely but another book if I need it.
5,Biology isn't what it used to by,"This book is for a college course, but it has been a terrific read! We have made so many discoveries in science in the 20+ years I've been out of school that it is fascinating just to look at the pictures. It also comes with access to online learning. I may keep it so my high school son can get a head start on his science classes!"
5,A Skillfully Written Textbook,This is an exceptional textbook. Each topic (covered clearly and thoroughly) lays the necessary foundation for each successive topic. The diagrams provide further clarity to the material and are placed accessibly on the same page as the written text. I highly recommend this text to anyone who wants a solid grasp on the fundamentals of biology.
2,Not as claimed,Note clearly said CD included. It is the only reason I picked this vendor out of all options. When the package arrived CD was not included.
4,Comprehensive and Easy-to-understand,"The molecular biology portion ( Ch 1-9 Kreb's Cycle, Calvin Cycle etc.) was a bit lacking due to its confusing terms and bad explanations but the rest (Ch 10-fortysomething was WONDERFUL!The photos and diagrams were an improvement over the previous edition and I can honestly say that the book was straight-forward and easy to follow. It also came with an interactive CD-rom that had chapter reviews, activities, animations, and interactive tests on it which was a tremendous bonus while studying.Each chapter seemed to relate the human world to other animals and plants whice was a good thing because it clearly showed how everything was related in the world."
5,quick and easy,The study guide I ordered came extremely fast. It was in excellent condition and I am very happy with my purchase.
3,Standard T & A Show From SI,"From the looks of the other reviews on this page, Beavis and Butthead are not only alive and well, but they have access to the internet!Huh huh...cool video."
3,Attractive but hardware is faulty,"The quality of the mirror is fine, but while putting the mirror together the screws were easily stripped because the medal was very cheap and soft. So, in appearance it is fine but the assembly left much to be desired."
2,Assemby issue,"This mirror arrived quickly on my doorstep with no problem. It is a nice piece of furniture and I was really pleased as I took it out of the box. It does require assembly, which is the problem.As is the norm these days with everything I have bought that is made in China, the hardware is cheap and doesn't fit right. The screws are too long so that the base doesn't tighten enough to be stable and the metal is so soft that I very easily stripped the screw heads (and I am not a very strong person, so this is just silly). I need to go to the hardware store to pick up new hardware for it. Since my husband is out of town for 3 months and I work full time and have an 8 month old, that is unlikely to happen any time soon. So, the mirror is propped against the the wall and will likely stay that way for the next few months until I'll have time to replace the cheap hardware. It's a pretty mirror though."
4,Mission Oak Mirror.,"I am very satisfied with the Mission Oak Mirror. It went together very easily with 4 bolts. My only complaint would be that the finish on the frame is a little inconsistent, meaning that the frame for the mirror does not exactly match the uprights on one side but it is pretty close."
2,"Carton apears to have been opened and resealed, assembly instrutions missing, product chipped and scratched","I bought this as a Christmas gift and after opening found that the items apeared to have been opened. The assembly instructions were missing and the inserts for the screws were in different parts packages, another reason I beleive it had been opened and repacked. There one was good chip but near the base, not that obvious. The left hand main post had been rubbed hard enough to rmove the stain. Something I can fix but should not have to. Overall, not impressed with Powell at all. Consider this before you purchase something from them."
2,Disappointing but useful in parts,"Not a massive help for prospective new comers to Malamutes or mushing. Very little practical information about care of dogs in different domestic settings (minimum exercise requirements, can they live with cats, how big a yard do the need.....)....so disappointing. But lots of anecdotal stuff on the history and development of the breed which is great. But unfortunately this is all inadequately referenced and there is no bibliography or list of sources...Basically there is a lot of information here but 'could do better'"
2,Not a great book for a new owner,"This book is full of great history on the breed and information on how to show and sled your dog (once you get to that stage in growth and training!). If you have or are bringing home a new puppy it is not the book for you. I searched for this book because it was recommended to me. I think now that recommendation was only because this certain breeder had a few ""mentions"" in the book. I am looking for NOW information on my new puppy. This book is great for my friends who stop by -- they look at the pictures."
4,A refreshing and clever comedy!,"This smart plot deals with a mistaken exchange of apartment among a free-spirited dancer in Paris ( the glamorous Juliette Binoche) and a frazzled New York psychoanalyst, starred by this fabulous actor William Hurt. As you may guess the comic spiral of confusions, mistaken identities and a golden retriever made of this sympathetic films one of the most remarkable ones of this years.Once more, Chantal Akerman proves us why she is still the flaming torch in this field of Belgium. Admirable direction and enjoyable performances al the way through.A must see."
3,"Charming, unknown romantic comedy","Definitely a pleasant surprise. William Hurt plays that curmudgeon character well, and Juliette Binoche is delightful."
3,Fun cute little movie,"Juliette Binoche is just great as usual. THis movie is nice and relaxing, the story is nothing crazy but it is a very nice entertainment. Worth Watching."
2,Over ambitious film under delivers.,"The premise is a little unrealistic, that a uber-psychiatrist would temporarily abandon his Manhattan practice to switch apartments for a month in Paris-a switch with an unknown woman made through the newspaper. Incroyable!But when you have a chance to make a film with two Academy Award winners, Juliette Binoche and William Hurt, set both in New York and Paris, who would pass the chance? Chantal Ackerman could not, the opportunity to make her first English speaking film a bonus.The film is a reminder of how difficult it is to cross the pond movie-wise. Nuance and sub-text is awkward or incomprehensible here-the threads on which the movie is woven are frassled.This artsy little film survives entirely on Binoche's vitality, her French innocence and enthusiasm dominates every negative New York influence her character encounters.It fails most everywhere else, sadly."
1,A complete waste of 2 good actors and your time.,"Hurt and Binoche are normally intelligent actors, and what they are doing in this inane, irritating formula film is beyond me. No one intelligent enough to survive New York would find himself in any of the circumstances that are constantly required to haul this movie step by labored step to its clearly pre-ordained ending."
1,Disappointing!,"Although Juliette Binoche and William Hurt turn out imaginative perfomrances, this movie lacks dimension and reverts to the standard shrink/patient sketches through the middle of the movie that will have you sleeping on the couch. There was just not enough new material in the script to turn this into the comdeic romance that it should have been although it starts and ends well."
1,Nick and Jessica variety hour,"It was dumb. It was not what I thought it would be. No acting skills on Jessica's part. It was all about Jessica not too much of Nick. Whoever wrote the script, didn't do a good job."
2,Embarressing Part 2,What a waste of money. Waste of space. Waste of time. I'm a fan of both Nick and Jess but you'd be ashamed to own this. Not worth a dime.
2,Embarrasing,"Whilst I do like Jessica and Nick, (I was a fan of Jessica since ""I'm gonna love you forever"" and I always liked 98degrees), this is embarrasing.On Newlyweds, I think she's actually funny. I love the show and I don't see the negatives that people talk about. This however was different. I can't beleive they need the money, so Jessica and Nick - DON""T DO THIS AGAIN. I couldn't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face. It's fine to do songs along with other famous singers, but don't sing with a car, and don't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times.Yes there are some good moments in this, but overall,? I was cringing considerably."
3,Not their best work...,"Ok now dont get me wrong, some things in the variety hour were really funny, but then again there were alot of things in there that are sooo LAME!! In my opinion they are trying to be Sonny and Cher and EVERYBODY knows that Sonny and Cher are the absolute BEST and nobody will ever compare to them! Nick and Jessica can try but...sorry guys it will never happen! Comedy hours are great when Sonny and Cher do it but Nick and Jessica just make it look bad so Nick and Jess PLEASE im begging you PLEASE stick to singing!"
5,We love Toot and Puddle!,"I love the illustrations in all the Toot and Puddle books, the are lovely and calming, and so does my 4 year old son. We have several from the series and they all get read at bedtime regularly. The stories are sweet and have messages about friendship and perserverence. I would recommend them to anyone with a child over 3."
2,Aikido is not a sport,"Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be. True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training, not of ego accomplishment from the likes of sports where there is a winner and a loser. Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition. The founder himself and his family have always shared this view and rightly so. 2 stars for the knowlege that might be attained for the positive use and understanding of the art."
5,So Happy.,"This is exactly what I wanted, and it fits my 2009 honda civic perfectly! The price was also very reasonable compared to many other dashmat retailers....some wanted as much as $70, but I paid $36 for mine from amazon, and I am very pleased with it. The quality is great too, although it did take awhile to get here (about 2 weeks), I am very pleased with it, and would order another one in the future."
5,Clear and Informative on natural good health.,Andrew explains clearly many natural and easy changes to make in your life.
5,Very Talented New Singer,"When I first saw Ryan Cabrera on Ashlee Simpson's reality show I thought ""oh great just another no talent going after the better known chick"" Boy was I wrong this guy has a great voice and the three song sampler that I just received is brilliant. Awesome lyrics, great strings and a terrific set of pipes. This guy is going nowhere but to the TOP!"
5,Great single,"I've had the pleasure of seeing Ryan perform around Los Angeles a couple of times now. I randomly came across his name on the internet and decided to check him out. I am very glad that I did. He has a great voice and has a knack for writing some great songs. His first single ""On The Way Down"" definitely showcases his talents. It's a fun, catchy song. I am expecting this to jumpstart his career. The other two songs ""Let's Take Our Time"" and ""True"" are also as good. I am really looking forward to his debut CD. If you like artists such as John Mayer, Howie Day, Matt Nathanson, Matt Wertz, etc. then Ryan Cabrera is for you. Check him out."
5,Great song,'On the way down' is awesome + very well produced. Ryan has a gorgeous voice and the lyrics are well written. I can't help comparing this song to Ashlee Simpson's 'Pieces of me' which is kinda dull (If Geffen thought that was the best song on the C.D just imagine how bad Ashlee's album is!)
1,meh just buy the whole album,which has 11 other songs just as good as this one. Just buying the single is a waste of money.
5,Great set of texts,"Purchased the entire set of these (used) for my mother (at different times). She is very pleased with them and I have also used them for more information on Bible study. Really easy to read and understand. These were recommended by my Aunt who attends a large church in El Paso, TX where many there have purchased these for Bible study."
4,Not the binding I want,The book is in great shape as advertised. The vendor got the book to me right away. I wanted the red and gold binding though.
5,very good,"i found this @ a local music store in the hip hop section, i love the beats and grooves, youve got to check it out."
3,Hard to clean!,"This is an okay product, it works. It does put out alot more steam than other humidifiers I have bought. You can use a little salt in the water to help the machine work. Kids could potentialy get burned if they touch the steam, so keep them away.My biggest gripe about this product is the design. The hole to pour out the water is under the blue circular part (see photo) Since it's in the middle of the water reservoir, it's difficult to empty the leftover water from the base. If you are using it a few days in a row, you end up with black soot, or mold in the base, and again, very difficult to clean it out."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF THIS AWFUL PRODUCT!,Black soot from the deteriorating heating element comes out in the vapor you breathe.See the four (4) pics I provided in the above product-picture gallery.
1,THIS BOOK HAS WAY TOO MANY ERRORS,"WHEN READING THE BOOK, I FOUND WAY TOO MANY ERRORS THAT I HAD TO STOP READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE MY STOMACH HURT FROM LAUGHING TOO HARD AT ALL OF THE ERRORS. IF YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT NETWORKING, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I USED THE EXAM CRAM NETWORKING + PLUS BOOK ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND PASSED THE TEST ON FRIDAY."
2,Don't use as your only resource!,"As other have stated this book contains a bunch of errors. A person who is not familiar with the content, and using this book as a learning tool may well be hindered by the errors. I don't recommend using this book as an exclusive tool. I also found the sample test questions didn't match the answers, and I spent a bunch of valueable time trying to sort out which answer went where. The sample test for Unit 10 was an absolute nightmare. None of the questions matched the answers. You get what you pay for. This book was within cheapest of the books offered in this category. It is obvious that the editors rushed to get this book into print."
4,Good Solid Release,"Many years after the original Bezerk was released The boys are back with Bezerk 2.0, its got the same feel as Bezerk, probably slighly more modern, and not as boppy as tracks like ""Love Bomb Baby"" or Noize Level Critical"". Ive heard Wazbones and was not impressed even though two songs from that release are in fact on Bezerk 2.0. Tigertailz have released a newer relese titled Thrill Pistol which i cant get into, a completely different feel and style, much more alternaive, But Bezerk 2.0 is definatly back to the early feel from these glamseters from Cardiff.Stand out tracks in my opinion ""Do It Up"" ""TVOD"" and the ballad ""I Believe""Worthwhile if you love Bezerk"
4,A Russian Intrigue,"This book presents the problem that many Russians faced during the time of the Czars: to revolt or to meekly accept the harsh realites of autocracy. The principal character Razumov is a quiet philosophy student who gets caught up with the anarchist Haldin. Instead of helping Haldin Razumov goes to the authorities and betrays him.This leads to further complications. Razumov has been appointed as if by fate to become a tool of the autocracy; he has no choice really. He is sent on a mission to Geneva in order to spy on Russian emigres living there.Haldin's mother and sister are living there waiting for word from him. The emigres are grotesque. Eventually Razumov confesses that he is helping the government and is almost beaten to death. In the end Razumov returns to Russia where he is cared for by a servant woman. Conrad suggests, as he does in most of his writings, that our fate is something beyond us and his skill is in showing how that is so"
3,Not up to snuff,The book could have been interesting but it's simply not up to Joseph Conrad's usual quality. It's rather plodding and the characters are not really convincing.
2,Not what I expected,I read only a few pages and did not find it all that interesting. It was more history than action.
1,Under Western Eyes is a very boring experience,"Under Western Eyes is a very boring book.and I would not recommend it for any ones reading enjoyment. It was advertised as a ""Western"" Novel but has nothingg to do with the US or the West. I didn't finish it as I couldn't stay awake long enough to read more than one page at a time."
3,Misleading title,I picked this book thinking it was a Western about the Old West. Turns out the story takes place in Russia. I read a few pages but it isn't my interest. Others might love this book so it owuld not be fair for me to knock it.
3,A good book but the quality of paper is not that good,"If you are buying the book to read it for school work or research it is great. The writing is large, you can highlight, write small notes... If you will buy it to read it and add it to your collection, it is not a good option, you can find better"
1,BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT BUY FROM PUBLIHER 'BIBLIOLIFE'!!,Hugely disappointed (and ripped off) when I received this copy. The type is illegibly small. The cover graphics appalling. Feels like a bootleg copy. Unreadable!
3,Disappointing,"I wanted to love this book. I loved the idea of a combination of chick lit and a Regency-set historical. I loved the cover and the blurb on the back. But overall I felt disappointed. Mainly because the historical characters seemed to act and sound just like the modern ones. There were some interesting plot details that didn't quite work for me either-Note potential spoiler!(I just can't see Napoleon conveniently leaving his study unguarded, can you?)The writing was nice and I loved the modern characters-they were all really well written. But I don't think I'll buy the next one.sorry"
1,Yawn...,"After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before, written much better, but never worse. Nothing new or original here. I've run into these stock characters many times before and that was more than enough. For me this was a waste of time. Has the obligatory sex scenes: yuck. Secret History of the Pink Carnation should not be allowed in same room with books by Austen or Heyer."
3,There are 2 more of these?,"Well I guess someone must be reading this author's series for her editor to publish two more.Actually I found it rather silly. This was the kind of thing that MAY have appealed to me when I was a young teen but now-nope. I read it because I wanted to read something light-it is that-very light weight.It is most definitely a romance novel with all the usual cliches. I wouldn't read it necessarily for the humor-I know I didn't find it all that amusing. On the level of lightweight romantic novel,I guess, it is alright."
4,chick lit with a twist !,"so if your looking for some serious historical piece don't grab this book. but if your looking for a light fun read take a chance! i really enjoyed reading this book, i love chick lit, what can i say. i know some of the reviewers quite detested the fact that it wasn't as history driven as they would have liked and wasn't some academic work of literature; but i for one like reading something that takes my mind off all the seriousness of my already too serious life. it's a unique chick lit- it throws you back in time, and has espionage, romance, and a good sense of humor. it's a great book and i can't wait to get my hands on the sequels!"
1,Brown Paper Packages Tied Up With String,"This novel could have been so much more. It seems anyone from Harvard can get a book deal these days. The author may be a little too young to undertake such a series of books. I was lost in the unrealistic characters and the over used catch phrases like ""brown paper packages tied up with string."" As soon as I would get the score of The Sound of Music out of my head she would say it again. Don't get me started on when she talked about Robin Hood wearing manly tights. Overall very disappointing. Leave this one alone."
5,sense and sensibility,"It is a truth universally acknowledged ... that ""The Secret History of the Pink Carnation"" refers to ""sense and sensibility"" (lowercase) on p. 76, which gave me great hope for the continued good fun of this novel. In the spirit of Jane Austen, but modernized significantly, it did not disappoint! I cannot wait for the second installment."
1,Zounds! One is all it's worth,"A light, light, light book. The best that can be said is that it's a good book for when you're totally brain-dead; it gives you something to look at that doesn't take much intelligence. Slightly escapist.Other than that, it's a mess. The characters are basically modern people set back in the 1800's, with token allusions to the era. The way they spoke and behaved, aside from overused exclamations such as ""Zounds,"" was much more 2004 than 1804. Others have spoken of sloppy history; I don't know enough to critique that, but it wouldn't surprise me. I grew increasingly irritated by the anachronisms.In short, I have a sneaky suspicion the author has good connections. To get not only this book published, but an entire series?? Zounds!"
2,R rated Scarlet Pimpernel wannabe,"Alas, what begins as a light fun read deteriorates to farce.The author tried to weave a modern search for a historical swashbuckler in with the period action. The current day tale is quite unnecessary and gets lost. As for the swashbuckling portion of the story, the French officials are the only ones who seem unable to determine who the cloaked figure is. He's busy saving England from the French, while groping Our Heroine. The author spends far too much time (and written detail) on the groping and panting, swollen this and that, bulging other. As for Our Heroine, the author cannot decide whether she is cunning enough to overthrow the French plot against England, or cunny enough to lure half the men in the story.An ok summertime beach read, but Scarlet Pimpernel is a much better read."
1,Close Your Eyes And Think Of England . . .,"I, too, was drawn in by the appeal of an ""historical novel,"" thinking to learn something of the French Revolution, The Scarlet Pimpernel, Napoleon and Josephine, 18th century espionage, etc. as implied by the marketing. The two leads do talk a lot about ""Saving England"" and ""Restoring the Monarchy"" . . . unfortunately, the author spent more time writing ludicrous and wildly improbable sex scenes than anything resembling history. Perhaps Willig intended a spoof of Jane Austen written as a James Bond novel by Georgette Heyer but if so, it misses the mark."
1,"Historical gaffes, obvious humor","If you find scenes like the below funny, this is the book for you.'Meanwhile, Miss Gwen was advancing on [Napoleon] Bonaparte, backing him up so that he was nearly sitting on Josephine's lap. ""While we are speaking, sir, this habit you have of barging into other people's countries without invitation -- it is most rude. I will not have it! You should apologize to the Italians and the Dutch at the first opportunity!""'""Mais zee Italians, zey invited me!"" Bonaparte exclaimed indignantly.'I bought this book hoping for a delightful romp through the imaginary days of the Scarlet Pimpernel. I was disappointed. The humor was heavy-handed and the behavior was wildly inappropriate for either Orczy's social period or that of the First Consulate."
4,Splendid Romp Through History,This was a very fun read. I quite enjoyed the story line. It isn't necessarily a page turner but does have you thinking about it when not reading it. It reminds me of a sort of romance novel.
4,Really fun read!,"Since other reviewers here have already dished on the storyline, I'll just say that this book is truly fun. Willig has down pat the nuances of the petulant English youth of the time, and I chuckled several times through-out.I was impressed by Willig's writing - she is only twenty-six after all - and I got into the adventure, eagerly soaking up the tale. Pink Carnation reads like a ""larger in scope"" romance novel, with adventure, laughter, and plenty of neat surrounding characters - all of which make this story come to life.And who could resist anything resembling the tale of the Scarlet Pimpernel?"
1,How disappointed can a Book Club be?,"Based on a review of this book, my book club decided to read it. When we then got together for our monthly meeting to discuss the book, our meeting quickly turned into a meeting of laughter and unbelief. How in the world did Miss Willig get this book published? Unfortunately, we all agreed that it is by far, the worst book any one of us has ever read. Between the 'zaps' and 'thumps' and so on, we were not sure if we were reading a cartoon. The vocabulary is not of the times, and the manner of writing is not only boring, but it detracts from a story which perhaps has potential. Between the 12 of us in the book club, we might have read the whole book. Our suggestion is, please don't write the next book!"
2,Trite phrases make me cringe,Let me state right now that I didn't finish the book--I put it down as soon as the Purple Gentian made the stupid remark about Amy's kissable neck. I couldn't care less about whether the book is faithful to the period setting or whether the characters are able spies.It's just badly written.
2,Plagiarism at its finest,"This book is the first in a series, one of which was ranked highly as a great summer read. To be fair, it is easy to read (unless typos frustrate you) and the subject matter is light and entertaining. Your time could, however, be better spent reading Shakespeare or Jane Austen in the original. Willig has shamelessly incorporated not only the setting but also the unique characters and even the phrasing from earlier, better works."
1,"a silly bodice ripper, nothing more",I took someone's recommendation on this - she billed it as a somewhat more substantial novel. It isn't. Just another bodice ripper. If you like that sort of thing. I don't so I'm not even sure if it's a good one. I imagine this as porn (but for women) - all about the sex and the story is silly and improbable and actually dumb.
5,Solid Chick Lit,"As a pimpernel aficionado and someone who enjoys a good writer, I really enjoyed this book. It's more than a beach read because of the intelligence behind it and I look forward to Willig's future releases."
1,Dumb.,"As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel, I looked forward to this book very much; thankfully, I got it out of the library rather than paying for it. I read the book in one sitting with a growing sense of frustration--nothing seemed real. The characters were completely modern, the war seemed more like a trip to Disneyland than a dangerous thing, and the characters were so dumb they deserved to get caught spying. There was no sense of realism to the book. Perhaps I expected the wrong thing, but this book seems almost disrespectful to the people who suffered during the time the book is set, as it has utterly no concept of their suffering."
1,"Every time I see this book, I throw up a little in my mouth.","I'm a book lover. I respect books as the wonderful gifts they are, and am usually the kind of person who frowns at someone else for a cracked spine or dog-eared pages. That's just me, obsessive compulsive about books, like Cervantes' Translator character in Don Quixote.That being said, I've never had a stronger desire to rip something to shreds as when I was stuck reading ""The Secret History of the Pink Carnation"" by Lauren Willig. I like historical fiction. I enjoy it even when it isn't accurate, so long as it is written well. But this book isn't even close. It's insulting, as in, I can't believe they publish this pooh. There's a place for writing that is this bad. The internet.To sum this up, Pink Carnation is comparable to bad fanfiction. Find some good fanfiction online and save some trees and money by not buying this book."
1,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"The publiciity surrounding this book suggested that it was a well-researched historic novel. This book is pure romance and utterly predictable. The author has a good flow and is pleasant. However, the plot is weak. I think the author has a future in romance but, alas, this book is more of a rough draft than a finished product."
1,Ugh,"I can usually force myself to read a romance novel, not so, however with this. The constant use of simile, including the ridiculous love scenes, ""She cried out her pleasure as a thousand diamond sparkles exploded across the back of her eyes..."" (please) was annoying in the extreme. The author tried to be funny, but ended up being obnoxious instead. I did give this one star, and even if I could have given it no stars I would have given it at least one due to the author's effort to entertain her readers. Next time I would suggest she do a little more research, and give her readers a little more to chew on other than her one dimensional characters, and predictable, silly story."
1,"Obvious, contrived, amateurish","Gads, this is practically unreadable -- loaded with cliches, obvious hints, and all the other chick lit staples. I could not get past the first couple chapters, in which a grad student is simply given free reign with and access to a chest of invaluable letters by the letter-writers' heir. That credibility-killer was enough to stanch my interest, but i read on a little further as I didn't want to be hasty. It only got worse...Give this a wide berth."
3,candy you can feel good about,"This is froth at its best, built on a strong foundation of intelligence and wit. There is enough history to count as having eaten your vegetables before you dive into the dessert. (Not that history is a bad thing, how else could we have costume drama.) Enough so that if you're caught reading this in the dentist's office by someone you want to think of you as intelligent you won't look too bad."
4,"Good Balance of Romance, Mystery and History","Lauren Willig is all about mixing the genres on mystery, historical fiction and romance. I actually read the second book (The Masque of the Black Tulip) first and only liked it so-so. However, this first one is much better. The author makes the mixing of genres work in this book, where she didn't in the other. The romance wasn't too ridiculous, the characters fun and likable, the historical context appropriate (though ONLY the context is non-fiction, the story is entirely made up) and the mystery remain an undercurrent in the book without the other pieces taking over. Willig remembers each piece of book (romance, mystery and history) and balances them well."
5,Delightful Adventure!,"I was fortunate enough to snag an advance copy of this wonderful novel. Willig is truly a gifted writer, masterfully weaving her own historical expertise into a gripping and romantic storyline that will appeal to anyone craving adventure. This is a fabulously entertaining read, and one of the most delightful novels I have come across in some time."
4,Potential Shelf Life,I loved the direction Lauren Willig took this novel. It was like reading two books in one- a historical and a contemporary romance. Yet it still managed to blend seamlessly throughout the entire novel. It was actually one of the better romance novels by an unknown author [to me] that I have read recently. She is definitely an author that I will pick up again.
2,Juvenile and Historically Atrocious,"This reads like something a present-day 17-year-old might have written. I suppose as a light-weight, fairly brainless, romantic throw-away novel, it's okay, but I mainly found the characters to be unbelievable, unsympathetic and annoying. The historical aspects are so badly done as to be ridiculous. A young woman in 1803 who acted as Amy does would have been looked on as a trollop, to put it nicely, and the hero, Lord Richard, who claims to love her, would rightly have been considered a cad or worse. The dialogue and characterizations often struck me as anachronistic they're so wrong for the time period. If you like Jane Austin or the Brontes, stay away from this."
2,Predictable,"I'm always excited for a historical novel with a female lead, so I was very excited to start this book. However, I found it laughingly predictable (the cover gives away the secret), and I found the characters to be one dimensional. Napoleon is a cliched, noisy, little man, Amy is an obnoxious, perky, heroine who acts like she lives in the 21st century. For those of you who know the term ""Mary-Sue"" it applies here.For all the ""research"" done about historical events and places, Willig forgot to look into manners and social customs. She attempts a Jane Austen tone but fails.I was expecting historical fiction along the lines of Magaret George and got a tawdry romance novel."
3,Fun Read,"Normally I'm a very lenient reviewer, but i gave this book only three stars because it doesn't live up to its potential.This is a fun light hearted book - the humour is good and the difficult switching between two time periods had been done with ease that surprised me! But the characters ended up remaining two dimensional - especially the two main ones. It ended up being more of a romance between two main characters than the actual mystery regarding Pink Carnation. And romance is a mild word - I can think of more words - none of them appropriate for a review...But at the end of the day - I'm not averse to reading more books from the series (not immediately though) and I guess that must account for something! It is a good beach read and a good introduction to the series - no more."
4,Worthy but needs editting,"I nearly stopped reading this novel after the first 50 or so pages--too much minutia and characters that were seemingly not worth knowing or caring about. However, I'm very glad that I persisted because I found the most appealing man in Sir Richard with his galant charm and quick wit, not to mention his heroic pursuits in defense of his beloved Mother-England. But he is so addictively charming and Willig is masterful at creating a sensual romance between he and Amy that is a MUST READ EXPERIENCE. I wish he were in more novels so I could enjoy him again and again!"
5,Genre-defying!,"I've never before read a book that blends so well into such an array of genres--romance, mystery, adventure, historical, comedic... this book has it all. The story of a spy named the Purple Gentian and the girl who wants to unmask the Gentian, you'll be laughing, crying, rooting for the heroine and biting your fingernails all at the same time!"
1,Misrepresented item,"This item was listed as a hardcover book. When I received a paperback version, I contacted the seller. He claimed it had been listed as a paperback. I sent him a screen dump which clearly indicated ""hardcover edition."" I returned the book to him and have not received my money back. BUYER BEWARE."
2,Silly story,I read it quickly and thankfully it was soon over.Not much to the story except to highlight how one teacher dealt with her midlife crisis.Sky61
2,This kit was made for beginners to understand the basics,"I found the two books to be lacking in subject depth. Many times there would be a statement of fact which I knew meant nothing, but instead of following the statement of inference with the underlying facts the author would just go merrily on his way with the next subject. This collection of two books and a CD was worth about $19.95 instead of the $160 required to find out it's uslessness. If I could get my money back I would and if someone other than the authors immediate family had written in a review I would have never bought this kit. I think Microsoft Press should either rewrite this kit or take it off the market."
4,Very good intro for the clueless,I had never touched SQL Server before looking at these books and I barely even new what it was. But this training got me up to a competent level where I can administer the server and write SQL code. It's not super detailed so I'm not sure if it would suit the advanced user who's trying to be an expert. It is very good for the beginner to intermediate user.
3,Binoche in a Different Light,Interesting film. Its portrayal of homelessness and artistic bohemianism has a ring of authenticity. This is s very different sort of role for Juliette Binoche. It is advantageous to see here attempt something so different from her other work.
5,carax at his finest,"this movie may come off as a simple love story, but let's face it, it's not. like most anything done by carax, it's more about film, and its semiological consequences, than anything else. this film, number three by carax, shows a strong truffaut influence, e.g. tirez sur le pianiste. though not as experimental as pola x, and not as indebted to godard as boy meets girl, there are clear tributes to vigo throughout. self-conscious, highly symbolic, intertextual. carax may be the finest director of his generation. just consider his very human treatment of lavant's character, for example. only truffaut, or maybe bresson, compares to that kind of characterization, though surely an ironic ""realism"" given the context of this film. all in all, this is a great achievement."
1,Utterly cr@ptastic!,"This movie starts slowly & drags on from there. There is nothing appealing about this film: even the lovely Juliet Binoche is made up to look horrible most of the time, & at best plain in some of the later scenes. Here's a clue for you: if the best thing that can be said about a film as shown in largest text on the back cover is ""Inspired & original,"" then you know you've got a real loser, since it isn't even ""memorable!"" OMG what a dog: take this thing back out behind the barn & shoot it to put it out of its misery!"
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,"This movie is loud, annoying and cliche. It romanticizes poverty and violence. Waterskiing on the Seine, and blind, coughing, limping amore-corniness to the point of pain. And bad acting! The giggling parts were cringe inducing, that and the ""art"". All in all, it made me dump the person who recommended it to me. I know that sounds like it biases me, but really, this and ""Blame it on the Bellboy"" were the two worst movies I have ever seen. ."
1,Unwatchable,"I own lots of French DVDs and watch them all the time so I am by no means trapped in a Hollywood sensibility. To be fair, my review is based only on the first quarter or so of this film, which was as much as I could stand. If you -- like me -- have a limited capacity to get down and dirty with psychotic street people living like animals, then you and I are thinking alike. Obviously many people have watched it and heartily approve. To me, it is unwatchable."
3,Les Amants Du Pont-Neuf,"The film is not fun to watch. It is 'demanding'. The young couple are living in poverty but are pretty feckless. It is rather like a Mike Leigh movie without his humour. However, it is well made - often brilliantly photographed with some spectacular set pieces (fireworks and snow). So, we are glad to have been able to see it."
1,"No good, don't buy it.","This is more like a toy than a therapeutic massage device. It's advertised as two speeds, HA! The low speed was the only one you could feel at all. When I switched to high it just hummed. Six different heads do no good at all if the motor doesn't vibrate. It may be OK if you just want it for your face. But it absolutely will not relieve sore muscles or tired feet. Amazon says they will take it back, so you can always do that. But it would be better to not buy it in the first place. Save a trip to the Post Office. Look at some of the other massage units. One of them must be better than this. 'Nuff said."
1,Dr. Scholl's DR7512C Personal Massager,I returned this product recently because it had virtually no power to loosen tight muscles even though it came with two speeds. Disappointing when you suffer with neck aches and headaches.
5,Great,"I love this CD. It is the old fashion type of christmas songs, with a Brenda Lee twist. If I am not mistaken, this rockin around was the one featured on Home Alone."
1,Lousy cd!,"This great music from Brenda Lee deserved better representation than this lame cd. For some unknownreason, the label reissued these wonderful performances - but used a mono source instead of the readily available stereo sources! What a waste of money! I'm happy to see it's now pulled from the market. The new 18 song package from The Millenium series is superior AND THEY ARE IN STEREO FINALLY! So don't waste your $ on this junk!"
5,Great!,Grew up listening to Brenda Lee Rockin Around the Christmas Tree record and so glad to find her songs on a cd!
5,Old time xmas music,It was great. Love Brenda Lee anyway. Use to have all her old records. Her Christmas music is the best. Amazon has it all!!!!!!!!!!
2,Marvel Ultimate Alliance- Not as Good as I Had Hoped,"I had high expectations for this game, but was Ultimately let down. Getting to work with all of the superheroes is great, but since you have four at once, they tend to get in each other's way, and you can become boxed in. It is also not always intuitive as to what your goal is for each level, and it is easy to get lost without a full screen map. I started out at the easy level, just to learn how it all worked, and now I can't change the level without restarting my game: kind of annoying."
2,"bad controls, pretty repetitive","the wii controls for this game just really feel like an afterthought, they really don't work well at all. it plays better with the more standard alternate controls. This is basically an isometric brawler, pretty fun using your super powers to beat up dudes for a while, but it quickly becomes repetitive. there are many better games for the wii."
2,It's not worth buying if you already have other X-men games.,"The graphic of Wii version is the same as my Xbox classical but it still looks good to me. The game play is not more interesting than the old X-men game I have on classical Xbox.The most disappointing thing is the Wii remote controller does not work well with action games. Many times, I moved the controller to one direction but my character moved to a different direction or it did not respond at all. To get accurate movements, I have to use Nintendo classical controller to play action games. This is where Wii loses its attraction because movements on the classical controller are not as ""natural"" as the Wii remote.The only positive thing about this game is it has more characters than in other X-men games.In short, it's not worth buying if you already have other X-men games."
2,Just a rating,"Im not in the mood to write a whole review for this game because in my opinion, its not even worth that. The new Wii remote controls for this game suck and its just a copy of X-men from older systems. Not worth to be on the Wii"
4,This Box has 17 and not 16 DVDs - Episode Sequence,"Two things that I did not see mentioned or mentioned incorrectly:1. This box has indeed 17 DVDs and not 16. The 17th is the Bonus Disk mentioned in some reviews. It is tucked at the far right after DVD 16 in a plain white sleeve. It also took me a while to discover it.2. The Episodes are not in the airing sequence, which is usually the logical one but in production number sequence which is usually not the logical one. Thus it helps to get an episode list like for example from www.epquides.com and then jump around in the correct order."
4,"Which came first,Star trek or Space 1999?","I guess I am going to upset a few ""trekkies"" with this review. But as a new Star Trek ""Next Generation"" fan I was a bit surprised to see a lot of similarities between the two.There are several episodes in Space 1999 where they bring up the ""Prime Directive."" Also there is an episode ""Alpha Child"" where a child is born then matures immediately which is similar in a way to the episode where counselor Diana has her baby. The stun gun idea, the costumes..... it all seems like this is a great idea source for the later Next Generations series. I do agree however with the other reviewers about it being two dimentional and charcterless. But it is worth watching as a background to Star Trek's Next generation. (I will probably get blasted by Original Star Trek fans who will no doubt let me know that this series has borrowed its' ideas from the original Star Trek. I can't tell as I have not seen that series since I was a child)"
5,Guilty Pleasure,"OK, I loved Space 1999 as a kid. I still like it. There, its out there. Phew. My family barely tolerates it. Even my sci-fi fan kids don't particularly like it. That just goes to show that this is not for everyone. It is nowhere near the quality of any generation of Star Trek. That much is certain. The science is wonky at best. However, for all those who question the science, please note one factor, they are internally tight. That is, a scientific flaw in one episode is the same in another. That gives it less of the feel of making up the rules as they go along.Lighten up, have fun. This isn't a boxed set of Nova!"
2,Mystery Science theater stuff,"I remember watching Space: 1999 as a kid and totally loving it, so I came to these DVDs with great anticipation.Big mistake. :-)I'm frankly astounded by the complete implausibility of the stories, not just scientifically -- as if sci-fi has ever really played by those rules -- but the stories are just so ludicrous, in ways I don't think Star Trek could match. The situations seem totally random and the characters are inconsistent at best. OK, so a number of Star Trek episodes were ludicrous too. But I kept watching these hoping against hope for some redeeming quality. Untimately, I found myself reduced to making fun of this crap a la Mystery Science theater. I'm amazed that TV ever got out of the dark ages."
5,good food for thought,"Here is a short work on philosophical thought, that although condensed, and compact, still manages to explore and lay out, alot of food for thought that touches on alot of philosophical ground. Karl Jaspers' work on Existentialist philosophy is one that makes pretty good sense overall. Worth contemplating and learning from."
2,HUNTING FOR A CONCLUSION TO HUNTING WARBIRDS,"Author Hoffman did well in bringing the Kee Bird (B-29) renovate-to-fly story to the reader. His vivid character descriptions made one feel he was in a smoke filled, ""expat"" barroom alive with dreams and deals. However much like the Kee Bird herself, Mr. Hoffman's book failed to clear the runway and fly the reader to a satisfying landing. After the Kee Bird tale the author lapsed into a meandering style as he wrote of hohum tell-me-about-yourself visits with vintage aircraft collectors and relatively mundane (cf. the Kee Bird) aircraft recovery ops. Additionally, as noted by another reviewer, if you are a student of vintage aircraft you already know of the Hoffman tales via PBS, Discovey, and aeronautical periodicals."
2,A disappointing read about a fascinating subject,"My immediate enthusiasm for this story waned pretty quickly, under the influence of Hoffman's many errors of fact, so disappointing from one with his aviation credentials. Such obvious and simple errors, which should have yielded to even the most superficial research (You're standing there in front of the engine&#65533;Just count the cylinders, fer Chrissakes!), cast a nagging doubt over everything else he has to say. And why the hokey cloak-&-dagger act concerning the obsessive collector ""somewhere in the midwest""? The Walter A. Soplata Collection in Newbury, Ohio was written up in Jon Allen's ""Aviation and Space Museums of America"",and has been known among warbird buffs throughout the world for more than a quarter-century!"
5,Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II,"Although some of us might be a bit obsessive about aircraft and World War II and might question that interest, Carl Hoffman clearly delivered an impressive account of the search and discovery process thru the eyes of many dedicated individuals. He presents the stories well; readers almost feel we are right there. It's a terrific book worth reading!"
2,Review of Hunting Warbirds,"The author obviously knows little about aircraft. This book contains many mistakes to the point of being annoying. The stories contained have been covered earlier and better in assorted aviation magazines of the past few years. If you are into airplanes, you have already read it."
4,Dexter Does It Again,"Dexter appeals to all Stephan King type fans. Over the top weird, but thought provoking vigilante. Jimmy Smits makes a good lawyer with a dysfunctional family but not much of a killer. Good story lines though."
5,Great Show!!!,"This is probably the only place I have seen a bad review for Dexter on. This is great Show and everyone I know absolutely loves it. The first episode of season one take a while to pick up, but after it's smooth sailing through the rest of the seasons. It's a psychological thriller, and at times it can be a little gruesome but it is the best show I have seen in a while."
3,Dexter season 3 & 4,"The show is great but the last dvd of season 3 and the first dvd of season 4 are blank, only the intro and nothing to click on to play the show."
4,still going,"I honestly don't remember a lot of what happened during this season, but I'm pretty sure he still hasn't gotten caught or stopped killing people who kill people."
5,great series,"Mr. Hall does great work once again, i love this show and couldn't wait to get it. Since i don't have showtime this is one of the ways i can watch besides online which is less convenient than DVDs to me."
2,Great show. Horrible DVD (no extras on the disc!),"I'm a big fan of Dexter, and I really enjoyed season 3. It took a couple of episodes to get into it, because several new characters are introduced and for a while it seems unfamiliar. But the stories are immensely intricate and satisfying. Great show.Why the 2-star review? Because the DVD ""extras"" are not actually on the DVD. You have to go to a web site to view them.Want to enjoy the extras from the comfort of your couch? Tough! Showtime doesn't want you to.But didn't you PAY for this DVD? Doesn't matter. Shut up and watch the way Showtime wants you to watch. You may think you're a Dexter fan, but you're not: you're a potential video pirate. You're lucky to even get an actual DVD in the box.Plus, the extra interviews are uncut, and the quality is poor. One segment has a solid minute or two of a high-pitched tone that drowns out the sound. Some people might like the rawness of the content. I find it to be just annoying."
3,Okay,"How many boyfriends can one sister have??? The plot line was fairly predictable at this point. But, I will still buy the next season."
3,Great show....messed up DVD,"The show is awesome. Watched the entire thing in two nights. My problem is whoever made the DVD messed up the chapters. In seasons 1 and 2 you could skip the ""In the previous episode..."" and the opening credits with two chapter skips. Now if you skip it once, you are ~5 minutes into the show. Why mess up something so trivial?"
2,Surprisingly Disappointing,Oh the dialogue - the dialogue! It was like watching an episode of Murder She Wrote. Why dumb it down? Season one was great. Season two was good. Season three? Hmmmmm. I'll remain optimistic about Season four.
2,Painfully Bad Season,"I just watched the first three seasons back to back over the course of about a week and a half. I was a little skeptical about the hype, but was quickly drawn into the first season. Season two was great up until the last couple episodes. Season three is pure crap, from start to finish.The powers that be have taken what was a well written and well acted show and transformed it into a second rate soap opera. I can almost hear the director yelling, ""Anguish, I need more anguish!!"" at the actors as they go to a close up of agony on the face of whatever actor is grossly overacting the cheesy and predictable drama that is unfolding in any given scene on any given episode of season 3.If you want a well written, well acted, well directed drama, buy The Wire. Season 3 of Dexter is a waste."
5,The Best Season Yet. Serially,"Season 1 was harrowing and chilling. Season 2 was tense and dramatic. Season 3 has it all. It seems the writers (bless 'em) really hit their stride in this season. Everyone gets their spotlight, and everyone shines like stainless steel in a hard spotlight. I cannot enthuse enough about this season of the series. If you haven't seen any Dexter, don't start here. You'll miss the nuances of character development. If you've been following Dexter you WILL find yourself captivated like you were on the slab in one of his killing rooms. I will not give away any plot points. Suffice to say that everyone from the directors to the actors to the writers have stepped up and delivered an epic plot arc. This is my favorite season thus far, which is a strong statement when considering how amazing the 1st season was. I cannot wait to see where Dexter and company go from here."
5,Dexter,There is never enough Dexter. My whole family loves this show but we do not subscribe to Showtime. You keep Dexter coming and our family will keep buying. Please I hope he never goes off the air.
5,Dexter - the best,Got hooked and this series and have enjoyed it every since. Great writing. Never know what to expect. Passing the cd's to friends.
3,"3 disc ok, one disc seriously flauld.","Three disc out of four worked great, maybe a few skips. One disc had a bubble on the the disc and would not even load. Only offered a $5 refund on a $20.00 purchase."
2,"Great Series, DVD Spoils It","Wonderful series, great season. Season 3 does a good job of transitioning from one story and scenario to a completely different one by the end of the season.There is an issue with the DVDs, however. The main title screen shows a background loop of scenes from the series. These scenes are from the whole season, not just the disk you're watching, and they contain major spoilers from later in the season. These scenes are unavoidable, they begin playing at the menu screen, and you can't turn them off. Its very disappointing, not to mention unnecessary.Verdict: Great show, love it. Skip the DVDs, though, grab season 3 through digital distribution if you want to watch all the episodes fresh."
2,Good Price but Video Quality Questionable...,"Don't know if this was a bootleg or what, but the video quality was poor.Kept pixilating during motion sequences.Other than that, we love the Dexter series."
2,Not very thought out...,"The one thing I notice is that 'negative' reviews are not looked highly upon, especially shows with a following.And another thing about rating this. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be rating the product (blu-ray dvd), or I'm rating this season of the show.More specifically I am rating this show's season.I am a huge fan of this show, but i felt this season was VERY sloppy. Very underdeveloped ideas, sub-par drama, followed by lousy resolution and following action.Compared to the first 2 seasons, it seemed like this season was a collection of random ideas they joined together that were rejects of the other seasons.The Shows acting was great, and the first 3-4 episodes were good/great. It led to some mystery and developing drama... But just became unfocused, and seemed like... the person who originally was writing the plot died and let some random person just try to finish it.Great Show, i love it, I just hope the next season redeems the show."
2,Worst season yet...,"When I first saw this show, I thought it was a bit overhyped. As I continued to watch it though, I really began to enjoy it, and thought that just maybe it was as good as I had been told. Season 3 really made me ask myself what I ever liked about this show. It felt like a standard, joe schmoe cop show almost. Dexter's sister is now an ace detective, Dexter's exploits are not shocking and completely predictable, and the remainder of the cast provides one pointless subplot after another."
4,Dexter,This is a cool series keeps you on the edge of your seat and waiting for the next step. Its great
3,dexter,its so great to be able to watch episodes for such a cheap price! but it didnt stream too good...but it wont keep me from buying more episodes..
5,Season 3 will NOT disappoint!,"Dexter explodes with season 3. If you're wondering how each season can just keep getting better and better, join the crowd. Each episode in season 3 is absolutely mesmerizing. The razor-sharp humor is there, of course, but wait until you see Jimmy Smits play Miguel Prado. You simply won't believe how amazing he is. The action is gripping, explosive, etc., etc. I know I'm gushing, but it is so very deserving of the highest rating I can give it. After watching season 3, you won't be able to deny that Dexter rocks! The entire ensemble of actors, Michael C. Hall, especially, deserve accolade after accolade. You guys deliver!"
4,Quite good,i enjoyed this season of dexter. gave many twists and brought new light to dexter's life. However i do believe that out of the 3 seasons that are out on dvd this is my least favorite. all in all this was a good season but deff. not as good as its predacessors.
5,"Great season, well worth watching","Jimmy Smits was amazing. I hope they bring back Jason Manuel Olazabal in the future, his character has a lot of potential. The story line is a good one, but the suspense was not there this season and I missed it. Dexter is maturing and that is interesting to see. I really wish his sister would grow up a bit, her immaturity is getting pretty annoying."
5,Dexter,Got this for a great price. My daughter has already finished watching. Can't wait until I find time!
2,dexter season 3,"I like the series, but the picture quality of this dvd was bad. I expected high definition picture which this was not."
3,I do not know.,This is a xmas gift. I do not know how it will meet the recepients expectations. NOw I have to add 4 more words duh
3,flawed dvds,"I bought these two seasons, 3 and 4, new, as well as seasons 1 and 2. The blue ray is good, relatively speaking, but several of the dvds have flaws on them which make them freeze, and attempting to clean them does not help. As a result, I have to forward to the next portion, and miss some of the content. As much as these blue ray discs cost, Amazon should have better quality control. Trying to send them back for exchange is too much of a hassle."
5,Awesome Show!!!,"I don't have Showtime, but saw Michael C. Hall inSix Feet Underand loved him!! So I boughtDexter - The First Seasonand loved it too!!I sawThe Second Seasonand was blown away by the direction they went in! I haven't seen the 3rd season yet, but will snag that when it comes available. I sure hope the cover changes, though. This odd-colored, Andy Warhol style just doesn't work for Dex. And the tagline ""Power-Saw To The People"" is outright corny. I hope it has tons of extra goodies unlike the first 2 season. Showtime has really screwed Dexter fans with the extra material on their DVDs! You get more extra stuff by visiting their site than on the DVD, which doesn't make sense! Can't wait until next season, too!! Kill 'em all, Dexter!!"
1,Horrible!!!,I am glad that Amazon sent me a review because it reminded me of what I ordered. It has been over a month and I still have not received the item. The shipping still says it is being shipped. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS USERS!!!!
5,Dexter - Season 3 Blu-Ray,"I received my item in a very timely manner, and with excellent packaging. The product was sealed and no scratches or defects of any kind on the discs or the case. Would definitely buy from again!"
5,Fantastic Season,"The season, obviously, is amazing and still extremely compelling and very funny! A guaranteed must for all Dexter fanatics alike!"
5,dexter,dexter is a great show the actors are all believable and true dexter does have a huge job protecting his family from his crimes.you could actually call him a vigilante.by far in my opinion the 5th season was the best so far trinity was done justice by john lithgow.looking forward to season 7.way to go dex
5,Season 3 = AMAZING!,"This 3rd season of Dexer just keeps on getting better, and better. There are 12 episodes each Season, and as of today we're up to number 8. (That mean's there is 5 to go!)December 14 will be this season's finale date. Hopefully the DVD will not be far behind!"
2,Dexter Season 3,My DVD's all played with a certain pause during each revolution of the DVD that made watching the programs maddning. Would not buy from Amazon again because of this.
5,The Best Series On Television,My Husband and I love Dexter! It is the best series on TV rite now. I have not missed one episode in all 3 seasons! Can't wait to have them all on DVD so that I can watch them anytime I want!!!
5,Inticing!,"We have loved Dexter from the first episode. He is America's favorite serial killer, for sure! The episodes leave you wanting more."
2,"Great series, but technical issues","I was only able to watch the first 2 episodes in this 3rd season so far, and because of that I'm not overly happy. I'm sure the season itself is good, as the first 2 were amazing, but due to technical difficulties I can't see the rest of it, and apparently I'm not the only one thats run into problems of this kind with it, so... The first season played fine on a PS3, but then it'd automatically reset the player if I tried viewing beyond that. I watched the 2nd episode on my PC, and then the 3rd episode would ""skip"" and become pixelated with every other frame or so, same with the 2nd disc when I tried it. Still anxiously awaiting advice that will allow me to enjoy the rest of the season."
5,dexter dvd from amazon,very happy with product dvd works fine dexter is a great show and amazon delivered the product promptly for a very good price would recommend everybody check out season one of dexter and use amazon they have delivered to me thus far problem free and offering great prices on new items
4,Even Better the Second Time Around,Fans of Dexter will definitely want this in their DVD library. This season was one of the better ones of the entire series.
5,"Lady of Green Cheer ""says""",Dexter is a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the psyche. Dexter is a charming person trying to fit into society while he manages his darkness. I love this series enough that I may break down and upgrade my cable for the channel it airs on. I am just so ready for the newest Dexter to come out. I loved each of the Seasons and would not be able to name one as a favorite over the other.
3,Dexter,The season three is great and exciting. The second DVD skips which is disappointing.I rate this product as a 3
3,Dexter lost his MO,"The first two seasons Dexter had a very strict code on how on he did things. He basically was a lone wolf without any attachments to anybody. This season all of his rules go out the window, he is basically influenced by everybody around him doing stuff that he would never do before. They modified his character too much to fit the story. They also made some of the other characters (Rita and Vince Masuka to name a couple) change too drastically to so they can fit the story line.I love this show because all of the characters are so well defined but this season they toss the rules out of the window. I'm not too impressed by Jimmy Smits acting either especially when his accent comes and goes and his overacting gets annoying after awhile.As you can tell I didn't like Season 3 that well but I still can't wait to see Season 4 though hopefully it will be better.Update: I did just see Dexter 4 and it was way better than season 3. I hear 5 is going to be fantastic too."
1,Dexter,I am so disappointed. I ordered Dexter and received it and went to watch it and disc 1 would not work. I returned that DVD and was sent a replacement DVD and again i went to watch it and disc 1 would not play. I still have not been able to watch Dexter Season 3. I am in the process of returning the second DVD that i received. Has anyone else had this problem???
1,DEXTER,"THE FIRST DISK WAS NO GOOD AND COULD NOT WATCH;THAT TOOK AWAY OF THE SERIES.THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH BUYING FROM AMAZON;NO ONE TO TALK TO OR RETURN TO;IF THE ITEM IS NO GOOD,THAT'S IT.THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD PROBLEM WITH ITEMS I ORDERED FROM AMAZON"
1,The decline of civilization,"I'm still having trouble trying to figure out how this show (if you can call it that!) came to be.Very 1-dimensional characters, a main character who is onto himself a criminal, yet he claims to be the good guy!Don't waste your time or money on this total waste."
1,"DEXTER, GOTTA BE THE WORSE SHOW!","How anybody can even call this show a show really boggles my mind. If you wanna watch something that is suspenseful and creative and deals with psychological disorders watch something created by the timeless director Alfred Hitchcock. His work is very dark but it is of excellent taste. This show is garbage in its purest form, just avoid it there are too many shows to list that are better than this POS!"
1,POINTLESS,Everything about this show and its pathetic freaky character is really pointless. I saw a really freaky ad for this show recently. His wife there is all slaughtered in the bathtub in her own blood and that freakish moron of a main character finds his baby sitting down on the floor covered in BLOOD! The best thing about this ad is you see the police arrive at his house just as he runs away. Hopefully this series is ending soon. Watch Rescue me for a good series!
2,Kindle Version- NOT recommended,"I am an advanced Latinist who spends some time every day studying Latin texts. The PRINTED version of Bennett's is one of the most valuable resources I own. It is concise, accurate, and complete. The most imporant features for me are the excellent Table of Contents and Index that allow me to quickly turn to exactly what I'm looking for. I would give the printed version 5 stars.The KINDLE version does not feature live links from the Table of Contents and lacks the Index all together. If I need to look up something on page 90, I have to turn the page ninety times to find it. This makes the Kindle version useless as a reference tool. I have removed it from my Kindle."
3,Difficult to use Latin grammar,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this book--I'm an intermediate Latin student, read the good reviews and decided to buy it. The format is cluttered, the grammatical information presented in a very unhelpful way, and the typography contributes to making it a chore to read--some of it looks like a reproduction of typescript. So I'm still using Wheelock, which within its limits is much more user-friendly. Why hasn't anyone written a more comprehensive Latin grammar for the contemporary student?"
2,Just not getting it,"Since many languages are based from the Latin, I felt it would be a great base. I'm having a little trouble getting into this one. I think it's because I'm just not quite ready for this particular style. I should have gone with one for dummies or something."
2,There are better grammar books,It is long winded. I was disappointed with this. Hard to flick through. Not really meant for a quick reference. I would hate to have to work through this.
2,???book needs ????? because it ????? and contains ????,much of the critical information is unreadable with question marks and other punctuation spuriously spread in the text where letters conveying information should be. Impossible to learn the language with such an unpredictable text.
3,"Overall decent, but not better than a modern grammar","The book is printed on what seems to be the same plates as 100 years ago. This often leads to problems reading some of the text; I wish they just could have retyped it. The grammar is fine; I've actually not delved too deep into it but it's very advanced and academic. Do not buy this book if you need something more of a general introduction or something very accessible to a non-expert (not that I am one - it was a required book from my professor). Not bad, but not great - this book was written a long time ago, and use of archaic language is pretty frequent. Nevertheless, it's never bad to have a thorough grammar in your collection."
1,Broke my kindle.,"In short, My kindle froze because of this book.When I first downloaded a sample of this book I couldn't turn to all of the pages but I liked what I had seen and thought the page turning issue was a problem with the sample format. I bought the full version. Big mistake. The book was slow to open and it took a long time to get to locations from the index. It froze temporarily weil I was turning to a page but I was able to get back to home. Something like two hours later when I tried to open the book again and an error showed up. I couldn't open it so I tried a different book that I can usually read. It also showed an error and wouldn't open. When I tried a third book the error apeared again and the screen froze. Now all I can do is put it to sleep and wake it up with the error screen.From the content I was able to see this book is seems to be a great resource. Just don't buy it for the kindle version."
3,Not enough depth,"This book has many useful examples and explanations about OLAP, ADOMD, and MDX. It also explains the basics of MS OLAP. However, the examples have many errors. Besides, if you are looking for depth, you will not find this book very helpful. The book is really designed for beginners who have little knowledge (or none) and want to learn about OLAP and the OLAP tools. These basics can be found in the online help and in the MSDN articles. If you want to learn about the cool functions in MDX and how they can be used to solve some of the drill-down and data presentation problems, this is not the book for you. I will have to give it only 3 stars because of the lack of depth and the errors in the examples."
1,You can get the same thing for free,"I've actually recommended this book on two occaisions to OLAP beginners because it is the only book I know of that covers OLAP from star schemas to DTS to cubes to MDX to ADOMD. That is this book's one redeeming quality. So if you read this, you'll get a good idea of what is going to be involved in an OLAP project. But don't expect to learn much else, however. There is very little in this book that you could not learn from Books Online or MSDN for free. The book is riddled with typos, grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and technical mistakes. I wonder if the editors were paid--they shouldn't have been! Don't be fooled by the ""Technical Reference"" moniker at all--it is not going to be much help to a technician, especially one who has even basic OLAP knowledge. Bottom line: get this book for a beginner who needs a broad, sweeping overview. Beyond that, skip it and read the free articles in BOL, MSDN, and SQL Server Magazine."
5,Tale of Two Cities - Baltimore / Indianapolis,"This superbowl V I remember as a youth barely and it was great to re-live this moment on dvd! I always loved Bubba Smith and the Baltimore Colts defense. On this viewing, this Superbowl V was not a very exciting game, filled with turnovers and some sloppy playing on both Baltimore and Dallas but good viewing anyway.I loved the commentary by Bubba Smith stating that since the organization left in 1983, the Baltimore Colts players have been shuned by the Indianapolis Colts, the present Colts have no history of their team during the Baltimore years or don't respect it, what a shame!!This dvd is still a great view!"
4,Another great Christmas with Gary Hoey,Another great Christmas album by Gary Hoey! He continues to entertain with his third Christmas CD of rock guitar instrumentals. I really hope that he continues with this series for years to come.
2,Not enough of a novelty,"There are millions of Christmas albums out there--why would I get this one?The only reason I can think of would be for the novelty. I'd heard a couple of Hoey's more intense Christmas songs (Grinsch, and Joy to the World) via ""illegal"" file sharing and thought it would be cool to make my parents listen to my Christmas music after listening to their lifeless drivel all those years growing up. I purchased ""Ho Ho Hoey"" 2 and 3 from amazon. Unfortunately this CD seems to have more than it's fair share of lifeless drivel. I guess I'll have to make a compilation CD of the few good songs and be happy with that.I guess it depends on what your expectation for the CD are. I'll probably buy one of Hoey's real CD's one of these days because he is a fantastic guitar player. This just strikes me as a novelty disc with a staggering lack of novelty."
5,"Adorable, Yet Functional","When I saw this, I knew I just had to buy it. It's just so cute. A mini tupperware container, who would have thought? I find that it's a great item to keep in your purse. I use mine to keep headache medicine in. The top stays on well, too."
1,Some good content but negative toward women,This book contains some great references to scripture but was clearly written from a male perspective that is not favorable to women. There are other really good Christian books on alcoholism that might be more helpful and encouraging.
2,Chahaat Review,I am a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan and I am starting to collect all of his movies. When I saw Amazon.com had Chahaat I was so excited. I ordered this movie and realized there are no subtitles for this movie even though the product description says it does. i was disappointed when I started to watch the movie and saw no subtitles. it's a great movie anyway.
4,review of Hindi movie.,Its a good Sharukh khan movie. Anyonewould like to know about movie I haveseen lots of Hindi movie old one let meknow I can tell you thanks. I have put quitea few that are really good Andaz Raj KapoorAsli Naquli Black mail Masoom and Chhaat Sharukhkhan these are really good movies. Thanks forreading my review Have a wonderful day.e-mail me for a discussion or question aboutHindi movies. I have around 200 to 300 dvdsif anyone interested let me know the names thanks.and what the best offer you can give thanks againappreciate for response.
5,great for teaching kids,"this book is a great example of a real live experience. alot of kids felt the same as LB, that he/she feels like a baby wearing a diper to bed. so they try and try and try not to wet the bed and after well you get the picture. this book is great for kids that have that problem."
3,Thought provoking,"This was a good interpretation of the story. It stayed true to the original work, but I thought that it should have been expanded in the way that the movie, The Box"" was done in order to make it a feature length film."
4,Good movie,"Although it differs slightly from the original short story ""Harrison Bergeron"", this is an very good movie interpretation. I bought the movie to show to my grade 10 students who thoroughly enjoyed it. The actors playing the roles of Hazel and George do an excellent job of portraying the characters."
4,Food For Thought,"Fascinating story. I don't understand the reasons behind the changes made to the original material for this short film, but the main message is still told. It left me thinking."
3,Adds nothing to the original,Your time is probably better spent by reading the original short story. (Be careful though: Vonnegut is both addictive & mentally corrosive.)
1,AN ABSURD WASTE OF MONEY AND 27 MINUTES,"So, Kurt Vonnegut had an interesting brain cramp, granted. Was it worth the rental price and a half-hour to watch it? Definitely not! The clip (and I must call it a clip owing to its brevity) was a complete waste of time and money. There was no plot or character development whatsoever, from what I saw. It is in interesting concept, yes--but it truly deserved a better and more thorough treatment."
3,too close to reality,this short video is very powerful....requires more than one viewing to fully realize the nuances. I purchased this videa based on a recommendation of a trusted reviewer and found it to be too close to reality if the political direction of the past year continues for much longer.
3,"Well done, but not close to the story",I thoroughly enjoyed watching 2081. What I can't wrap my head around was why they had to change so many things from the original story. The movie is fine on its own... I am glad they didn't call it Harrison Bergeron because that would have been a travesty.
2,Surprisingly short,"I remember the television version of this story, and the impact of that show made me want my own copy of 2081. I thought it would be a movie adaptation with character development and period detail beyond what the television version provided. What 2081 turned out to be, however, is a movie that doesn't seem much longer than the trailer. Perhaps the length was in the description somewhere, but I didn't see it; as a result, I felt short-changed after viewing 2081."
1,What?,What is this movie about? Communism? Mediocrity? This has to be the worst movie I have ever watched. I cannot even describe how bad it is. I can't believe there are good reviewers. Maybe those who made the movie. I cannot think of anyone in their right mind who could give a positive review.
1,25 minutes?!,"Somehow I got the impression that this was a remake of the movie that was out several years ago, or a new version of the story. This video would scarcely fill a half hour on television even if it had commercials.I was disappointed. Could be used as a discussion point in a classroom I suppose, by it would be better to have the class just read the story itself."
1,Not missing out on much,Unless you are burning up with curiosity to see this and have nothing better to spend your money on or have a gift certificate with only a few dollars left on it ...go for it. The written short story is better with using your own imagination. This reminds me of a 20 minute long trailer for a pretentious art film. I find it more of an insult to Vonnegut's work. That's just me. If you want to watch some great actors and the Vonnegut himself pay tribute with a cameo... Watch the film MotherNight with Nick Nolte.
5,wonderful!,"This dvd is well done. I used it to supplement our reading of Harrison Bergeron in my English class. The students enjoyed the production, it stimulated wonderful comparisons to the original, and it helped others with their understanding of the story. I thought it was beautifully done."
5,"Worth the sorrow and warning against empowering government ""for the greater good""","It was worth the rent. An artistic look at the direction America is headed. Government should protect individual liberty, from the both the tyranny of the mob, and all foreign and domestic threats. But only individual liberty. Government trying to ""handicap"" some in the cause of ""equality"" is going to far. Yet today we already have a ""handicaper general"". So this isn't much of a stretch. Government already tries to provide for the ""greater good"" at the experiences of the individual. Sadly we are well on our way.Worth the rent."
4,Amazing short film not so good DVD release,"I loved the short film, specially beacuase I read the story it is based upon. It was kind of dissapointing that there were no extras."
2,2081,Too short and you may not know what you are watching unless you already know the story line. a little short. Not worth the purchse price I should have just rented it instead of purchasing it.
4,Eye opening,I was introduced to 2081 in my world civ class in our economic systems unit and I only saw a little bit of it but I was obsessed on seeing the ending of it all. I found it and I watched it and all I can say is wow. The whole idea of socialism is chilling to me and and 2081 shows how far it can go when it is unchecked. I don't think Karl Marx wanted it to go that far when he created socialism. I would figure some kind of war came after the plot of 2081 unfolded but the backwards ways of 2081 may not be that far off. It might already be upon us.
1,1995 adaptation much better,"I first learned of Harrison Bergeron from the movie that Showtime made starring Sean Astin. While that film does vary a great deal from the original story, it is in my opinion far better than the original short story. I recommend everyone try and get a copy of the '95 movie.Harrison Bergeron [VHS]"
1,Not a full movie!!!,DO NOT BOTHER WATCHING THIS. YOU WILL BE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED. IT'S HARDLY EVEN A PRODUCTION OR CLIP. WAS OVER BEFORE I KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AND NOT CHEAP!
4,"2081, Herrison Bergeron, Vonnegut","It is a quick film. The movie ""Harrison Bergeron"" is a standard length movie and a little more ""Hollywood-ized"". ""2081"" does not spend much time developing the ""All men will be made (vs created) equal"" I have ""Harrison Bergeron"" on VHS and now converting it to a DVD format."
1,ONLY 20 MIN LONG! NOT A REAL MOVIE,"Full price for a 20 minute short? I feel ripped off. It was my fault for not reading the entire description, but I think the business model of this film relies on unwary customers like me."
5,Good rendition! Pleasant surprise,"Vonnegut fans will appreciate this well done rendition despite the short duration of the film. Clocking in at only 25 minutes, 2081 is not exactly enough to fill ""movie night"" but what it lacks in length it more than makes up for in substance. For those that wonder how well the somewhat elusive and reflective nature of the story will play out on film...the answer is ""surprisingly well"".The premise is simple enough, a dystopian future where equality for all has finally been realized through the use of facial masks for the beautiful, body weights for the strong and neural impediments for the smart. Those extraordinary individuals who cannot conform to mediocrity are subject to state sponsored rehabilitation that borders on torture.Although set in the future, the thought provoking premise will leave some viewers wondering if the future is already upon us."
3,"Closer to the original short story than the one with Sean Astin, but not worth the price.","Whether or not you're a Kurt Vonnegut fan doesn't take into account how much it costs to either rent or buy this twenty seven minute short-film. It is not like you are getting a full-on cast like a movie or tv series. A couple of the lines are switched, and a lot of the shots are just long, silent sections.Reading the short story was more fulfilling than watching this short movie."
5,"Powerful short film, intellectually and emotionally driven","I've only just seen this short film moments ago. The reaction is still sinking in. It was poignant and moving, a powerful message I really felt. Our gifts are beautiful and should be marveled at and embraced not hidden for the sake of equality. Fight those that would control us and contain us, robbing us of our intelligence and our gifts."
4,Well Polished Adaptation,"Overall a great adaptation of the classic short story, ""Harrison Bergeron"" by Kurt Vonnegut; a cautionary tale of government intrusion into individual's lives for the sake of the collective.Production values are very high here and that's appreciated for a short film, where you might expect less than stellar look-and-feel. As others have pointed out, the score for this film is just superb. The spirit of the short story is here as well, and that's appreciated. However, it is missing a certain je ne sais quoi that leaves me wanting more, it really isn't as moving as the text itself."
5,Great Buy,"As a secondary English teacher I use this with the short story, ""Harrison Bergeron"". It captivated the kids and they were able to write up a compare and contrast paper with it. It really held their attention."
4,Solid Adaptation,"Welcome to the Monkey House is one of the best books I have ever read. Harrison Bergeron is one of the main reasons for this praise. The story always made me really sad and the short film is no different. It moves along at a good pace and covers the story closely with 2-3 major differences (due to it being a film), but overall I would recommend a viewing to anyone who has read the story."
3,Prophetic view of the future,"The movie short is something like Ayn Rand meets George Orwell. It is a dismalview of the future where everyone is required, under pain of severe penalty, to be equal. Excellence and natural superiority are penalized to insure that everyone is equal; it describes a world that seems too close for comfort. It is certainly not a movie short for the Mary Poppins/feel good crowd."
4,Good reference book,"Good book with nice pics showing various bedroom styles. I didn't use every idea, or copy any of the rooms exactly - that's not our style - but we did get some good ideas that we incorporated into our rooms."
3,No it's not,"The Chieftains have been around for nearly 50 years and have released around 40 albums. During that time they have had many changes of lineup and engaged in many collaborations and crossovers. To select tracks from just 3 albums from a 3-year period and call it 'The Best of' is misleading, to say the least. It would make a good 'Best of Vol 2', if a selection from the pre-Columbia years had been the 'Best of Vol 1'. The liner notes struggle to rationalize the selection by calling it 'an overview of a dramatic phase' in the band's history. Maybe so. The notes end by saying 'this is only a chapter in an epic tale'. Quite so.That said, there's some first rate Irish music here, perfect for your Paddy's Day party. This is the sort of thing that, if you like this sort of thing, you'll like this. Just don't be misled into thinking you are getting 'the best of'. You are getting 'some fine examples of'.[PeterReeve]"
1,Very Disappointed,I have always loved the Chieftans and owned many of their tapes/cd's and have never been disappointed until now. This cd is definately not the best of anything they've ever done. I've never even heard of these songs. Wish I could get my money back.
1,Where is the Quality?,"Not recommended! How can you create a web page without images? The <IMG> tag has been overlooked. There are other errors as well. This ""reference"" may have been a little too quick."
4,Thank God for an HTML book that comes to the point!,"I'm not a techno-wonk, but the Dummies book on HTML drove me nuts with all its cutesy explanation, and frankly I couldn't figure out what it was talking about. This book shows the tags, shows all your choices with each tag, period. Buy this book, read some source code on other people's sites to see what they did, and you're set."
3,so-so (buggy),"I am generally a fan of Pocket References. But this one seems poorly debugged. One example is claiming ""align"" is deprecated for <td>. Turns out, this bug has made it onto the Errata page for the bookhttp://www.oreilly.com/catalog/htmlpr2/errata/ ,but only under ""Unconfirmed error reports and comments from readers."" If you write a buggy book, at least do the work to confirm bugs and fix them in new printings!"
4,<Nice Pocket Reference >,Good one for a quick reference to all HTML tags.GOod for beginners as well as experienced HTML programmers.
4,For a research project,Arrived as expected; this was a used textbook and the content is exactly what I needed and was looking for.
3,Mac OS X Basic,"OK, I have nothing really against this book. If you are new to Macintosh and have decided to take the plunge, or if you are a basic Mac user who would like to have the new OS's standard features explained to you, then by all means, get this book. I'll give it 5 stars for beginners.But if you are at all interested in what makes OS X such a exciting step forward for all Mac users (namely it's Unix underpinings), then get another book. This book taught me nothing I could not learn from playing with the OS for an hour. (Don't underestimate the value of Mac OS X's new Help files)If you are interested in learning the more interesting features of OS X, I recommend checking out Mac OS X Unleashed by John RayBTW, OS X is awesome. If you are thinking about installing it on you G3 or G4, go ahead, you won't be disappointed.Cheers"
4,All's well that ends well.,"With great anticipation I cracked open this latest edition of Lon Poole's classic book. Imagine my surprise and dismay when I discovered that it didn't actually cover version 10.1! I immediately called the publisher to complain, and to my delight, they sent me a CD-ROM containing an entire 10.1 PDF update to the book. What started out as a bummer worked out to my advantage in the end, and now I've got the supremely portable (10.1) edition. Hopefully they'll integrate this stuff into a future printing (which would earn it a ""5""). In the meantime, I can attest that Lon Poole hasn't lost a step in his lucid, thorough treatment of the latest rev of the latest Mac OS. Thanks again, Lon!"
2,NOT THE ORIGINALS BEWARE!!,"I was very upset when this CD arrived. I was under the impression that these were the ""original recordings"" of Mr. Autry's Christmas records. They have been re-recorded and by no means are they bad.......their just NOT THE ORIGINALS! I want the original Columbia recordings. I gave it 2 stars because he does sound great....again just not the originals!"
3,DogBones FleeceBones Pillow,This type of DogBones pillow differs from the original DogBones pillow in some significant ways. It is somewhat thicker and has a softer cushiony center. The fleecy cover is a little too scratchy for my taste to use against bare skin. The pillow provides good neck support.
2,Hoped for something this was not,I thought this would help me with my neck issues when I slept. Not too useful. Too bad. Need more letters to publish. This should do it
3,Good Pillows,"I use these pillows for cervical support while sleeping, howevever they were much softer and less support than those I purchased in the past. I still like them, but not as much as precious ones."
3,it's ok,it would be better if it was not as firm. it tends to hurt my neck more than help it. i had to remove some of the stuffing to make it better.
2,Uncomfortable,I was disappointed with this purchase. I had a neck-bone pillow for several years that was just wonderful. Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement. This one was much wider at the spot where you would place you neck. The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least. I would not recommend this to anyone. Wish I returned this the first day I got it.
3,broken bone,"When I recived my pillow it had been bent almost in half in the shipping box, this caused the middle of the pillow to feel under stuffed. My wife however is good with a needle and thread and was able to unstich on of the seams at the end of the pillow. After adding some stuffing and using a dowel we had it stuffed to my liking. Now the pillow is great."
3,too much stuffing,"It feels good but wayyyy to thick, too hard to get comfortable. The fleece feels good on your skin just too fluffy."
5,Great pillow,My mom loved her dog bone pillow which got so worn so I found this one for her. She was so used to her flatter one that she took some of the stuffing out.
3,Little Nemo and Popeye Make it Worthwhile,"For the most part, this collection is made up of sub-par characters like Raggedy Ann, Little Audrey, Do-Do, and Tobor the 8th Man.The value comes from Popeye, Superman, and Little Nemo.Popeye is one of my favorite cartoon characters, and his adventures in this package (""Out to Punch,"" ""I Don't Scare"") are funny as always. Superman was never one of my favorite characters, but ""Underground World"" and ""Electornic Earthquake"" are some of his best. ""Little Nemo"" is the first colour cartoon ever made, and it's fascinating and funny.Cartoons, especially those of Superman, Toonerville Trolley, and Betty Boop, look good. In fact, they look much better than the public domain videos and DVDs you're used to getting. The usual Cartoon Crazys extras (Production Notes, Reading Lists, Restoration Demo) are all here, as well as a few novelties. (Comic book gallery, wallpaper.)"
3,Mixed Bag,"Don't let the 3 stars fool you. This DVD set is going to be a valuable part of my library.The reason for the middling rating is that a few of the films on these DVDs didn't interest me because they didn't contain vintage NFL action, which is what I love about these releases.One was about what some players from the late-1960s, early-1970s did in the off-season, and two were about a minor-league football team.However, ""Eyeball to Eyeball,"" ""More Than a Game,"" ""Big Game America,"" ""The Old, the Bold, and the Young,"" and ""Lombardi"" are all going to be rewatched many times over the coming months and are highly recommended for old-school football fans."
3,Effective but needs cafeful installation,"This product works well and is great value however installation while only taking about 20mins, has to be performed carefully. Sliding the tailgate onto the rod and trying to get it back onto the truck, the end of the rod put a noticable dent in the outer skin of the tailgate, this was with two people too. Perhaps a warning from the manufacturer to be careful of this would have been helpful.Once installed though, even my 6 year old can open and close the tailgate safely. (2004 Nissan Titan)"
1,broke right away,Instal went great....worked awesome 4 times and then snap!! The piece in the tailgate snapped off....and I cant get to it.
1,Customer service,Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx 11 months. I read some of the customer reviews and learned that I am not the only one that has experienced this issue. The reason for my submitting this review is to inform others of the outstanding response I received from customer service. They are shipping me a new item and have provided me with a return shipping label for the broken item. GREAT SERVICE!!!
5,Simply Does Its Job,"Simple, straightforward design.Installation is challenging due to weight of tailgate, but instructions are excellent.Takes two husky people to horse the tailgate around.Online video helps understand process.The Easylift tailgate does exactly what is advertised, and does it quite well."
4,Not 100% But worth the price.,The EZLift didn't make the tailgate on my '06 Tundra quite as easy to lower and raise as the advertising implied but it improved it a lot and was worth the price.
5,An uplifting product.,"Easylift is one product that performs as described. Even big, strong guys will need help to install the gate. It would be next to impossible to do it without an assistant.While it's touted as a theft deterrent, there is nothing to prevent someone from trying to steal the gate, finding out they can't get it off and then just dropping it, causing damage to both gate and truck. I've had a stainless steel hose clamp around the slotted pivot point (right hand side on my F150) for years to make it a bit more difficult for thieves. Of course, the Ford also has a lockable gate, but it hardly ever gets locked."
4,Weight reducer,The product worked well after I deciphered some of the instructions (pictures) for assembly. It was a two-man job but went smoothly and took no more than thirty minutes.
1,"Dont buy this item ,, not worth the chance...",Bought this item for my dodge pick- up ..after I installed it. I opened my tailgate for the first time to try it out and the spring bar snapped it two pices just missing hitting my face... Its not worth the chance of safety.. it is a spring bar with a lot of tention. could be very dangerous........
5,works exactly as advertized,"04' ram. bit of a pain to install, but absolutely worth it. took under an hour to put in."
4,"Good functionality, painful install - Ford F350","I was very excited to get the EASYLIFT system installed on my 2001 F350 Crew Cab. The reviews are awesome, the idea is awesome, and the price was right!I must say the the install is not quite as easy as stated (in my experience). I felt very uncomfortable drilling holes, and the instructions, although clear where to put the holes, don't tell you that the metal on your truck WILL BEND once the easy lift is installed. This bothered me enough to knock off 1 star. The functionality is great, and it really does make the tailgate super light, but I didn't like the bending of metal.Would I recommend to a friend? Yes"
4,The basics of business,"This book is helpful for those wishing to start their own business but are unsure where to start. The concise writing answers most of the questions one can think of. This book, along with Guerilla PR Wired by Michael Levine, should be all that a young entrepeneur needs."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is a waste of time and money, the title is ""SMALL business kit"" but they talk about investment, deal with the media and board meatings? Seriously? So many things that maybe are helpfull for big companies but not for small or starting business. Don't buy it!"
1,"Tedious, boring and for larger companies",I was sorely disappointed by the contents of this book which is written by an attorney who clearly works with venture capital funded businesses and who doesn't understand a true small business.
3,and never see her again,It was entertaining. It was not the essential crime novel. But it did meat the price. It was entertaining.It was entertaining.
2,Caveat Emptor for younger students!,"I must issue a buyer beware for parents of younger students. I am a homeschooling mom and I purchased this for my oldest (early elementary grade level). It has beautiful drawings and the cover is great. However, I have to say that some of the content of the book would be too difficult for a young elementary student. For example, the page on Romulus and Remus shows them naked (as children) and they are nursing under a she-wolf. I just felt that this would be ""too much"" for my daughter to handle. Also, I purchased other historical coloring books from Bellerophon and they are much the same with nudity and odd pictures and caricatures that are INAPPROPRIATE for younger students. Use Dover coloring books!"
4,More fun with the Friz,"This is a much better collection than I was expecting! The segments are on baseball (friction), the Teacher-athalon (cardiovascular health), and (only loosely sports/games related) artifacts. I'm anxiously awaiting the DVD release of a collection with ""Inside Ralphie"", and the one on cardio-health is an ok substitute while we wait. For some reason, it seems like several of the most popular episodes are yet to be out on DVD... I wonder why? None of these are particularly outstanding, but they are all quite good and easy to watch, repeatedly, as toddlers & preschoolers tend to want to do. The manufacturer thinks this is for kids 6&up I believe, but I would say it may be more entertaining for maybe the 4-5 crowd. My almost-2 and almost-4 year olds watch them and probably don't get most of the science, but it still encourages them to ask questions and they do pick up on a fair amount of the ""simpler"" content."
4,Great series.,My 4.5 year old loves all the Magic School bus DVD's and this is one of his favorites.
4,This series is wonderful,"Our nearly five year old daughter loves the entire Magic School Bus series. She loves one of the three episodes on this DVD better than the other two, but she is happy to be able to watch any of them. The good thing about the Magic School Bus is that our daughter thinks of it as fun (who wouldn't want to go on an unconventional field trip?) while we know she is learning. It's clean, exciting education. Our favorite tape is Human Body, but this one is in second place."
5,Another winner,"My kids LOVE the Magic School Bus videos. The whole family has learned something, and the kids watch them over and over again."
2,Not about sports,"This is my first Magic School Bus tape and I am disappointed. It is not about sports but about friction,how the body system works together etc.If you are looking for an educational tape about sports this is not it.Also the teacher and students talk real fast in the tape making it hard for very young learners.I ordered the one on the human body and space adventures I hope they are what they say they are."
4,CHA CHA CHA,15 SELECTIONS OF CHA CHA MUSIC FROM THE 50'S RECORDED ON THE RCA LABEL. THE BEST SONGS ARE BY TITO PUENTE (OF COURSE) AND TITO RODRIGUEZ. GREAT CD FOR DANCING THE CHA CHA.
3,The Very Best of Cha Cha Cha vol1,Good selection of numbers with good cha cha rhythms. Decent sount quality but each piece is truncated very abruptly.
3,80s Double Feature,"Two diverse films and both sides of the DVD worked fine. Made the mistake of thinking both films would include 'Jaqueline Bissit' but the 'admirer' was a rather pedestrian spin on college kids. Have no idea how, or why they were 'R' rated."
2,not very helpful to me,"I looked at this book once and it had completely different drug info than my text, so I never looked at it again. Also, entire drug categories that were in my text were missing from this book."
5,Everyday situations as great drama,"It's so refreshing to find such a wonderful, low-key movie.Its basically a day in the life of a young woman facing her first day of work as a room service maid at a hotel.During that day she must face not only all sort of hotel clients but also the dilemma of how to deal with her boyfriend and his mixed feelings about her pregnancy. This is the kind of movie that shows that you dont need a million explosions and over the top situations to have great drama. It reveals that everyday problems can be just as compelling.This is a terrific movie with an amazing central performance by Virginie Leyoden.Seeing her in ""The Beach"" shows that sometimes ""Going Hollywood""is a step down in someone's career. Anyway..dont miss it."
3,"Real life, real-time, real boring","Although the lead actress is very adept at displaying nuances and emotion, and is quite lovely to boot, you'll have to excuse me for watching this movie with my finger resting on the fast forward button. I mean, if you want to have the viewer reach out emotionally, watching her every move works to establish certain aspects of her personality. But by the fifth uncut, step by step shot down the hotel corridor the movie goes beyond establishing emotions to outright fixation. In the end, it becomes simply too frustrating to watch.Plus the ending was lame."
4,the beach,"this filmis soooooooo exciting, especially with the actres that i never known before..... VIRGINIE LEDOYEN."
2,Poor - not recommended,"The material has no correspondence with the Microsoft requirements. Some of the topics actually belong in the Administration exam. The rest of the material isn't exactly wrong, just highly inadequate. The questions are utterly childish, and will give anyone a real shock when they try to sit the real exam. The supervising editor Michael Lane feels compelled to trot out his certifications MCP, MCSD, MCSE etc... every 20 pages or so. Perhaps he should read a book or two about editing instead."
1,Misleading material,"I purchased this book after taking the 029 test. I can honestly say that the ""test questions"" in this book bear very little resemblance to the questions on the actual test. The questions on the test are complex and difficult (often taking more 4 screens to present), while the sample questions in this book are just too simple.The actual test is much more weighted toward practical how-to, and toward interpretation of complex t-sql scripts. The MS Press ""SQL Server 7.0 Database Implementation Training Kit"" is much closer to the mark, but still not adequate.More to the point is MS Press ""Inside SQL Server 7.0."" In order to pass the test, spend a lot of time examining t-sql and thinking about how to use SQL profiler. The real test is about SQL practice, and not about the ""2-minute drills"" that this author seems to think are important."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I read a chapter and then threw the book in the garbage (I had already underlined a bunch of stuff). Don't waste your money if you have hopes of understanding SQL implementation and passing the exam.
2,Not well crafted...,"If you are fairly familiar with most of the subject matter, this book will be useful for reviewing for the exam. The CD has an exam simulator, but unfortunately all the questions are the same ones at the end of each chapter. If you are looking to learn something new about SQL 7.0, this isn't the book to use.There were far too many typos and poor examples. The book seemed like it was rushed to market. The editors should certainly feel ashamed..."
1,"Poor Choice for exam, NOT recommended","I bought this book to help prepare for 70-029. The test questions that come with the book are nothing like the real thing. The test questions on the exam are long and complex. They pose many life like situations that might be encounted as a DBA. This book does nothing to prepare you for those types of questions.I think this book would be helpful for someone trying to understand some of the basics behind SQL Server but having taken the test and used this book as one of my study guides, I will not buy another book from this company that is a ""study guide""."
1,"Too many errors and typos, and just plain wrong info","I had to force myself to even get through the first five chapters to see if it would get any better (it didn't!). I've done SQL on various platforms for over 10 years and am MCSE certified on MS SQL 6.5, and this book is horrible! For example, they confuse ""row"" with ""column"", and don't seem to know what ""dynamic sql"" is! The practice exam on the CD has 195 questions -- I gave up after question #60 because 10% of their answers were wrong, or at best amgibuous."
2,Buy the MS book,"Book is OK, it sort of follows the MS books. The CD is atrocious though. The self-test isn't at all representative of wht you would see on the real test."
1,Pitiful,Treatment of SQL 7 is very weak. The book's usefulness as a reference source is limited at best. It certainly isn't worthy of the title MCDBA study guide.
1,Not a good product,"This massager is not what I had expected. The motor is much less stronger than Dr Scholl's past models, doesn't hold a charge as long plus the head rotates making it difficult to hold a massage in one area. Additionally, if too much pressure is applied to the head area, the massager stops. I have a Dr Scholl's older model that I've had for several years that still runs alot stronger, holds a longer charge and does the job better. I think Dr.. Scholl's massagers have decreased in quality based on this and another model I recently purchased. What happened?"
4,Impressive Collection,"I was initially skeptical about placing my order for this collection of songs because I wasn't sure that I would enjoy them like I did back in the late 60s. I was right, I actually enjoy them more! This CD is a compilation of, in my opinion, some of the best, non-commercial tunes of that era. The voice harmonies are pure and the songs bring back many wonderful memories. This group of young talented musicians recorded some fine harmony-enriched melodies that will always have a respected place in our musical heritage. I am proud to own these recordings."
4,Great Read!,This is a nice introduction to developing a relationship with the Holy Spirit. The only thing that I did not care much for were the personal testimonials. I think if Renner would have stuck to the Word after the first couple of introductory chapters it would have been more interesting. It would have made the book more instructional and less testimonial.
4,Nice power pop,"Hot Rod Circuit is a fairly easy band to overlook, seeing as they play just straight up, poppy rock and roll that seems to be so popular these days, but they're doing this much better than most of the bands on today's scene. These songs are ultra catchy, and the great guitar leads help them pull ahead of the rest of the pack. There are no pretentious stabs at being ""emo"" here, just good old driving rock. At times I'm reminded of Superdrag, which is definitely a good thing, and some songs have those bouncy hooks that Saves The Day crafts so well. This has certainly been done before, and there is not a great deal of musical territory covered on this album, but it is a fine work of power pop amongst a crowd of weaker bands."
4,Syncline - downfolded rock layers,1. Dip-slip faulta. Movement along the inclination(dip) of fault planeb. Parts of a dip-slip fault1. Hanging wall - the rock above the fault surface2. Footwall - the rock below the fault surface
3,"If you like happy endings, this may not be a story for you.","The theme of a secret society is always interesting and I looked forward to the Geographer's Library--especially after reading a comparison of it to the DaVinci Code. However, the author's use of individuals from the former Soviet Union and the Baltic region to kill individuals in order to gain possession of certain antiquities resulted in a rather depressing tone. While every book does not have to have a happy ending, this book's conclusion was decidedly unsettling to say the least.After reading this story, I have come to the conclusion that the DaVinci Code was a more riveting book with a more satisfying ending."
3,Good effort for a first novel,"This was a very readable book, though the plot did get too messy and complicated from time to time. I believe a little more editing discipline would have made for a better book, though I did enjoy the book and enjoy following the author in his writings in the Economist magazine."
1,Written with the best intentions,"This book illustrates perfectly how the best intentions, a good style and decent research efforts can yield questionable results.Half way down the book, I found myself skipping entire chapters (the ones with the items description, like many readers) feeling they were anecdotic at best, but ill served the ""plot"".As a matter of fact, by page 250, I was still wondering if there was a plot - and I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it to find out...Well written - yes.Captivating - not in the least, at least to me."
2,I Won't Be Keeping This in MY Library,"On the front of my copy of ""The Geographer's Library"" is a blurb from the LA Times: ""by a novelist whose surname and sensibility fit comfortably on the shelf between Umberto Eco and John Fowles."" Fasman belongs on that shelf in alphabetical terms only, I'm afraid. Despite some well-worded passages, this book is pretty silly. A shame, really; it has an interesting premise."
3,"Ok, but I had higher expectations","I really had higher hopes for this book...it was ok, but nothing that I have to pass on as a ""must-read"". I gave it a three, because it's just that...average. Very well written and thought through, but no real high lights. Towards the end I just couldn't wait to get done with it. It could have been great, just never quite made it."
2,Big Let-Down,"The whole idea of the book is fasinating; I bought it without any recommendations because it sounded interesting. I kept hoping there would be a wonderful ending to tie all of the scattered writing together, but the ending was even more disappointing than the rest of the book. Don't waste your time."
1,I might have given the book 2 stars if it hadn't gotten my hopes up by starting off so well...,"While this book started off very well, it quickly went downhill. A murder, mysterious artifacts, an interesting woman...sounds like a good story, right? Unfortunately the story never delivers. Instead the book describes various artifacts (which definitely captured my interest at first) but then failed to actually tie them into the story in any meaningful way. If you really feel the need to read this book, get it from the library or wait for paperback."
2,Good idea goes to waste,"The book starts out promisingly and expecatations rise. As the plot develops however, Fasman gets lost. He explains little or nothing about the objects'powers and the whole point of collecting the items by the deceased is lost on me. Also the so-calld most important item, the Emerald Tablet is barely mentioned except in the end and it is left hanging in the air, doing nothing.It is a pity that a potentially good plot was dropped by the wayside because the author did not know where to take it next.My advice: save your money and buy something else."
2,Some good ideas that never manage to come together.,"Fasman is a talented writer, and many aspects of this book were generally engaging and interesting. However, these elements are too disparate and never manage to mesh into a satisfying whole. The chapters about the objects are never well-integrated, and unfortunately the ending is extremely unsatisfying.Paul Tomm is a young reporter who finds himself into something big when he looks into the death of an Estonian history professor. The story draws him into the world of alchemy and conspiracy, bringing him into physical and spiritual danger."
3,Reader Contract,"Fasman is a pretty good writer. Line by line I was engaged and moved along to wondering how (and when) the book would deliver as much as the title promised. But, the most interesting characters spend too much time ""off stage"" if you will. Were there too many characters in the flashbacks? I had trouble following the connections between the old and the new worlds. As many people have mentioned the ending was unsatisfying. A close analysis of what happened and why leaves me wondering."
5,The Geograoher's Library,"Although I've yet to finish the book, I'm thoroughly intrigued. It's well written and the characters, sense of time and place, are so well delineated that, as a good novel should, the reader feels him/herself as though they are there. If I'm not totally absorbed reading a novel, then I'm disappointed. This one is good."
3,An Okay Read,"This story follows a small town reporter as he uncovers a crime of international significance in a small New England community. The author follows the creation and acquisition of each item of the Geographer's Library, switching back and forth between our hero and unknown characters. A bit confusing and plodding in its delivery, it is not without merit if you have the patience for that sort of thing."
2,Where's the last chapter,"Well written, very well written in spots, but the ending is so weak as to make you feel you've wasted your time. An ending that requires a previously minor charater to enter and provide a narrative to tie up all the loose ends is very disaapointing. The artifacts that are detailed throughout build to a climax that isn't there. These are never explained and in fact you never really understand who it is that is so diligently collecting these items and why. Some of the wonderful characters might be recycled into a story with a punch line."
4,A Substantial Journey,"In my opinion, Fasman's, The Geographer's Library serves as a perfect compliment to Kostova's, The Historian. Both novels are prodigious in their historical grasp. Both present enticing and evocative views of Eastern Europe. Both offer captivating insight into ancient global empires which still cast long shadows over current world affairs. It was a pleasant surprise to find that a large part of The Geographer's Library's plot was based in Connecticut. I've lived in New England for decades and the descriptions were perfect. Although the protagonist's self-deprecation was endearing, there were moments when he was much too gullible to remain believable or sympathetic. While satisfying, the book's ending didn't quite reach the same dizzying heights as the preceding narrative. A few key details also remained unexplained. Great writing, a good read, and just creepy enough to produce chills: A-."
2,failed to go anywhere....,"Like other reviewers, I was excited about reading this book. I thought the plot and characters were great. However, I felt like I was treading water --- the story never went anywhere and the ending was a huge let down. Every other chapter dealt with certain historical artifacts, which were interesting to read about, but what was the point of providing us with so much detail? This detailed information was never used in the actual story.It's too bad, because it had so much potential."
1,Umberto Eco? John Fowles? Try Franklin W. Dixon!,"I had never heard of this book when I bought it at an airport bookshop, and now I know why. The writing is sophomoric and the plot silly. The author seems primarily concerned with displaying his erudition, but this book has none of the wisdom of true erudition. Nothing ever goes anywhere, and none of the characters ever develop or hold the reader's interest. According to the book's cover, a reviewer from the Los Angeles Times apparently said this was a cross between Umberto Eco and John Fowles. Honestly, I can say the writing and plot of the average Hardy Boys book is superior. Don't waste your money."
2,"""Da Vinci Code"" rip-off","Like Brown's ""DaVinci Code"", Fasman's ""Geographer's Library"" begins with the mysterious death of an eccentric academic. The protagonist,a young reporter from the local newspaper, is unwittingly strung along on a chain of interconnected clues that ultimately reveal the goings-on of a secret society. This narrative is interrupted in alternate chapters with separate narratives of individual items stolen from the academic's house. Whereas in ""DaVinci Code"" the separate threads of the story played into each other and kept the Reader turning the page, Fasman does a poor job with these separate story lines and they merely interfere with the main plot. As many other reviewers have stated, the ending was unsatisfying. For me, it was too Deus ex machina, and reminded me of a ""Scooby Doo"" episode (""I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you meddlesome kids!""). Intriguing title, but I can't really recommend this book."
2,Interesting parts that do not come together,"The book consists of the story of a listless and rather uninteresting journalist, interspersed with descriptions of alchemical artifacts and fascinating descriptions of how they changed hands. These two threads never really mesh, and the book just ends rather than resolves."
1,and the point was...?,"it's amazing how well written back cover copy can get someone to pick up a book and give it a read. Such was the case with this book, whose deceptive description packaged it as some thrilling adventure story of lost treasures with magical powers. Granted there were some treasures with supposed powers but thrilling this was not, in fact it was quite dull, no action, no traversing the globe for our ""hero"", no anything. Even at the bargain price you should just skip it."
2,Good idea. Decent writer. Bad book.,"While the underlying idea for the plot--the intrigues surrounding the re-collection and protection of ancient, alchemical items supposedly possessing miraculous powers--has lots of potential, a cumbersome structure turns what could have been a page-turner into a snorer. The characterizations and the plot did not receive the development they could have, given the abilities the author possesses, and the interchange between the ""modern"" story, past events, and the encyclopedia-style introduction of confusing items nearly brought the story to a stand-still. In short, the reader spends a great deal of the time wondering what is going on (and not in the sense of a good mystery), and worse, wondering why anyone would have told this story in this way. I, frankly, couldn't wait for it to end; but it just went on, and on, and on. Read something else."
1,False Advertising,"I was trapped between flights in Dallas and had run out of reading material when I happened upon The Geographer's Library. It was advertised with references to Umberto Eco and Dan Brown, but it read more like a cheap (but well-written, if you're not looking for literary art) charicature of the best examples of the genre. The author tried hard to display a sweeping knowledge of history, but ended up seeming superficial and in places a bit silly (as when a Soviet agent responds to a comment about inequality in the ""workers' paradise"" by saying all are equal, but some more equal than others - a ham-handed literary reference if ever there was one). To be fair, I don't usually go in for light fiction, but The DaVinci Code was sufficiently interesting to make me reconsider - this novel has firmly reenfoced my preexisting prejudices. If you like a light read, this is probably okay, but if you're looking for The Name of the Rose you will feel totally ripped off."
1,Horrible - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I read a great deal; 2-3 books a week and have done so for almost 40 plus years. This said it is very rare indeed that my opinion upon closing the book is that the author literaly owes me my time and effort back. Comparing ""The Geographer's Library"" to ""The DaVinci Code"" is a direct insult to it's author Dan Brown. Even the CD version of the ""TGL"" which I also purchased; was the WORST read CD I have ever listened to. It was read soooo slowly at times I had to ""read"" portions of the book simply to get through it. Mr. Fasman's obvious constant thesaurus use is blatant. To use ""big"" words simply to edify one's ego ruins simply reading the book, and enjoying the story and plot line. Even in the end Mr. Fasman never completely answers ever aspect of the plot line questions he creates. He leaves many roads simply open and incomplete. Shame on this author!"
1,Does not deliver on promises,"This book could have been so much more. Instead it grabs you with very cool short stories of mystical and possibly magical artifacts and their provenance only to let you down on the plot. It turns out that all those artifacts matter in the main story only as a collection. Not to use them in a story is actually a crime. You can't get people excited only to leave them abruptly in the cold, but that is exactly what the author does. The mystery is weak and extremely slow. And the resolution is even weaker and does not satisfy after all the build up of the individual artifacts. It is possible that the author was aiming for a sequel, but after such poor execution I, for one, would not be interested in a sequel in the slightest."
4,A different kind of book.,"This book suffers the curse of the DaVince Code. Any book with a historical setting that came out after that novel is always compared to Dan Brown's book. It is quite unfair however to lump this book into that group.""The Geographer's Library"" is a facinating mystery in a way that modern author's rarely write in. This is a book that I simply couldn't put down, and when it was over it left me with satisfying questions and wanting more.If you're looking for a good highly intelligent read that still works as a beach read, this book is a great selection."
1,Superficial,"This is the sort of book that gives software a bad name. It's superficial, doesn't support its claims with any substance, and resorts to evaluating products like IBM's CB without ever using it. They claim they've written substantial pieces of code with each product. I'd love to see it, and then I might be able to understand where they're coming from."
3,Industrial use only,"To powerful for home use - jet engineSound and flames brought out people from 4 doors away - my son was the fire watch with a garden hose - fried curb weeds, sent back the next day - $22.00+ to ship back Fedex"
4,I liked it a lot!,"The second book in this series is better - so keep reading. --Andrew As a mom, I really liked these books - they are clean, entertaining and true to the original movies. --Mom"
2,An okay book,"Well.... This book would be good if you happen to be ten years old. For me, even at age ten it didn't quite have the Star Wars feel, though I did find it interesting enough to want to read the rest of the series. Continuity though is important to me, and this book had none of it. However I will say that this series would be good for kids too young to read say, Heir to the Empire, but would still like to know what happened next. I personally thought that the characters did not act like they should, and the writing was somewhat cheesy. Older fans would definitly do better with Young Jedi Knights or some of the adult novels."
2,Wonderful littles stories to read to the kids,"I think these books take place after Truce at Bakura So I have placed themon the timeline at year 5 and 6 ANH. Are these 12 year old books worth reading? Who should read them?I came across 3 of these, books 1, 4 and 6 of 6 written b the Davids. They are simple stories and come illustrated in simple pen and ink. They are not relavent to the EU, but they are nice little stories about the star wars characters for younf listeners and readers. When reading to the young you need help holding their attention especially my ADHD son. Pictures help. That is also why I have turned to buying and reading the dark horse comics about star wars.Which is better? I like the comics better, but sometimes, with all those beautifully colored and inked pictures and the varying panels, it is hard for the kids to follow. But these simple little bantam Skylark books are sometimes perfect. Amazon actually had 73 new and used of the 1st book in the series when I wrote this in 2003."
3,It's good but you have to read the rest of the series.,"I loved the whole series, but this first one wasn't my favorite. The glove search was exciting, but the rest of the series is better. This is for 2nd-4th graders."
2,I think that this book gives Star Wars a bad name,I found this book to be really hard to understand even though I am a sci fi lover
4,A very good book.,This book had a good beginning and lots of action. There was no point where it was dull. It has good characters and a good lead to the rest of the series. A needed book for the Star Wars fan. (And Luke can drive a Y-Wing if he wants to!)
1,THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"How can people like this book?? It is babyish, and no true Star Wars fan will read it. The information it gives is completly false. There aren't any Grand Moffs, and Luke doesn't fly a Y-Wing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS BOOK STINKS!!!!!,"This book is not good at all. The only Grand Moff was Tarkin and in this book there are a bunch of them. Also, Luke flies Y-Wings and everywhere else he flies X-Wings. In the book they mention about Lando still having Cloud City but when he left for the battle of Endor, the Empire took it over. There are even more small mistakes in this book. If you don't have it, don't buy it. If you have it, throw it out or burn it."
3,Prepare to be Schooled!,"Unlike previous Yu-Gi-Oh games, this one is more than just duels. It also is about schools! You've got the normal battling to earn points to build decks. But, you also have monthly exam days that consist of written exams (10 multiple choice questions out of a large number of possible questions) about the cards themselves, a timed duel where you have to win with the cards in the setup in a set amount of time, and then a practical exam using a deck and having to perform the specified actions for the exam (play traps, play spells, do fusions, do rituals, do direct damage, etc.). This game requires a lot of knowledge of the card game over all.The rating drops from 4 to 3 stars for me because it is a pain to complete the packs. Also, if you fail your exams, you go back down to the loser dorms and have to work your way back up again.A good game though."
3,grerat game,i like all of the yugioh games ive been playing for about 13 yrs and i tried to find pc versions of a yugioh games and i couldn't find any good rated ones
4,Yugioh Rocks,YUgioh gx is going to be the best game ever thats yugioh!! You don't have to face the same old guy over and over again! And finally they put elemental heros in a game. But the downside is you can lose the game easier if you don't put in a safe place. Overall this is a pretty good game! Must have for Jaden lovers!
2,"rape, in any form, should not be romanticized","I really enjoyed this novel--up until about 2/3 of the way through, the main character is raped by the main love interest. It shocked me. I am sorry, this is something that is compleatly unacceptable. Many allowances can be made for the romantic nature underpinning both of the characters relationship, but it doesn't matter how much romantic feelings there are, rape is rape, and to continue and have the two characters fall in love and live happily ever after is a sad and rediculous thing indeed. Ms Kaye ought to have put her efforts to better use, as the social and political ideas were very good, but unfortunately, the book is worthless."
4,Bucket Boss Tool Pouch,"This Bucket Boss tool pouch is well made and should last a long time. This tool pouch has a good design that enables you to carry quite a few small tools without being bulky. The only thing that I didn't care for was the snap for the belt loop. When working in tight spots, it is possible to un-snap the tool pouch allowing the pouch to fall from your belt. This is still a handy tool pouch to use for small projects."
4,Get this one!,"I got this as a gift for my husband and I was surprised to find what a great product it was for the price. Durability is important to myself and to my husband and this one will last a long time. For the money, you couldn't do better."
2,Bucket Boss Brand 54045 Rear Guard,"Generally well made. Major problem is that the belt snap loop is designed too small to go around the manufacturer's own tool belt strap, so you must hang it off your regular pants belt."
4,Cool tool holder,"I really liked this product because it holds what I need most of the time (I install cable TV cable and devices). Goes on and off your belt in a snap. Could have been made with leather or something a bit tuffer. I put a hole in mine rather quickly with my screwdriver, but I still like it."
5,Great for the DIY-er,"For those of us who pretend to know what we're doing, this tool pouch is great for carrying around the essentials. I keep it ""stocked"" with a screwdriver, pencil, measuring tape, utility knife and pliers, and it keeps them very handy. The snap is solid, and there is no worries about this thing falling off or apart. The little strap and clip on the front even make a handy loop to keep a claw hammer. (Probably not a good idea, but I did say I was pretending to know stuff.)"
5,Tool Pouch,"This item was exactly what the description promised it would be. Might have been better if the flashlight pocket were larger, but, all in all, it is what I wanted."
3,"Good Concept, average quality",I really liked the pouch. It comes in very handy. I did find after a few uses that the stitching started to let go and pliers or channellocks would start lean out or fall out. It was very difficult to repair.
3,needs a stronger bottom,"this tool pouch is nearly perfect for my needs as a maintainence supv. i carry a greenlee 6-in-one screwdriver, irwin 6"" groove lock pliers, flashlight, mini level, inspection mirror, a/c mini screwdriver, disposal wrench, and several driver bits. it's much lighter than the now discontinued husky brand that i've carried for several years, but the bottom stitching isn't strong enough- my-6-in one poked through the bottom after about 2 weeks of carry. if the bottom was reinforced better it would be a 5 star for me. if you don't need to carry a pointy item it may work well for you, just didn't last for me."
2,good bad and ugly,"good: very simple treatment of the perl language. you can learn to program some relatively simple stuff if you haven't done any programming in 15 years (like me).bad: the book is ATROCIOUSLY edited. i find at least one significantly confusing typo every few pages. if you look on the bright side, you can use these mistakes to hone your skills on finding scripting errors, but in general, it seems to reflect a lack of care in putting the book together.ugly: this is for an absolute beginner who's willing to work through all of the typos. you will have to shell out additional $$ to begin to use perl in any productive manner."
4,A gentle introduction to Perl,"For Perl beginners, this book is significantly more readable than the O'Reilly texts -- I would like to have seen even more exercises throughout, though.Overall, a good springboard to a more in-depth text, such as the Wrox title ""Beginning Perl"". I deducted one point for a few minor (but annoying) typographical errors - this book needed one more pass by the technical editor. C programmers will quickly recognize the typos, but these could confuse some beginners.Also, this book covers the Perl DBI using the PostgreSQL database. Installing PostgreSQL is awkward on Windows, yet many beginning Perl developers probably use Windows. The Wrox book ""Beginning Perl"" makes the more logical choice of using the MySQL database, which is simpler to install and use on Windows (and also runs on most Linux/Unix platforms)."
2,Not a good book,"Unlike most reviewers on Amazon, I am not paid to write rave reviews about a friend's book. ""Perl A Beginner's Guide"" is not very well written. It has numerous errors and the book was put together way to fast. The current price for a used copy is $0.01. Way too much. However, if you like typing in code, maybe this is the book for you. The promise of ""FREE CODE ONLINE"" is simply not true. You will not find this book listed on the Osborne or McGraw-Hill sites. McGraw-Hill does not believe in free anything."
4,"overall, great value cordless wet razor.","I have been using my trimmer for about ten months now and it is still going strong. I purchased it because i like to shave in the shower. I just put another one in my basket as this is something that I will want to have for a long time. The battery holds a charge for a long time although I only use it about once a week. The trick to using this product is to use it almost exclusively as a wet razor. It requires soap or shampoo but gets a good close shave on my head and has attachments for beard length and blending. I am hairy but well trimmed. I use it as a whole body trimmer. It looks a little cheap but it is actually pretty durable. Again, it does not work well as a dry razor. But lather up this is smooth and efficient."
2,botton fell off,"the product does its job, it cuts hair.i opened the box and looked it over. the slide button fell off in my hand!!!!!i had to put it back together and super glue it.good product overall, if u dont mind repairing it apon opening.would not buy this product again..cheaply built."
3,Hindi,I've bought several Hindi DVD for my children. This one is OK. I like you are able to pronounce the Devanagari. I didn't like you didn't have English script to know what they were saying as in my other videos. Good for learning how to pronounce the alphabet which is what we wanted.
5,good,"ummm, this video brought back memories from a past life and experience.....I got it for somEBODY AND IT WORKED FAR BETTER THAN i COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED"
1,Cheaper at Sams Club as well,Well I guess its back to Sams Club cuz they are $2.00 cheaper. Gotta go with the good prices. Knew this couldn't last forever.
1,Back to Costco I guess...,"I used to order this all the time when it was $27.99. With the free shipping, it was a great deal. Now that it's $30.99, I will go to Costco and spend $2.00 less. It adds up!"
1,Price went up! Used to be $27.99,"I really love Enfamil, as its the only formula that my preemie daughter would except. I was sooooo excited to see that Amazon had the 38oz cans for only $27.99 each, so I ordered several so I wouldn't run out. The next time I went to purchase more, I noticed (after paying) that the price went up $3 per can. My local Sam's Club now sells the 38oz cans for about $1.50 LESS. I'm very disapointed in Amazon. Sam's has won my baby business."
1,item price increased,"Amazon has increased cost of this item by 2-3$ and this items is available less than $29 in the wholesale stores. Cost is star 1, even though the quality of item is very good."
2,Unfortunately the product was damaged(Seal Opened) upon delivery!!,"I have brought similar products from amazon which arrived in good shape, but my last purchase the product was delivered in bad shape, the can was broken and the powder(Formula) was spilt all over the package and had to throw it away.Hopefully, this does not happen again."
1,"Good item, priced WAY too high!!!","The formula is really good and 5 stars... however, the price is way too high for me to purchase it on here any longer. I can go to Sams and buy it for a lot cheaper and will do so until the prices go back down!!!"
1,"Price increase, not good for business","Formula, 5 stars! New price, 1 star! Like the rest, off to Costco."
2,discontinued item?,The info states is a manufacturer discontinued item. Although it my be exactly what we see on shelves it may be nearing its exp date. The label in the pic is the old one (new ones are shinny gold). Sams has it for $29.38 plus tax so it's probably a wash when you compare Amazon's sales tax savings (you do declare this on your State tax form..right!) and free shipping.
4,Enfamil Recipes,"Tired of having your enfamil lipil with iron, milk-based infant formula powder just the same old boring ways? Well, here are some dishes that will add a little spice to that tired old powder:Nutmeg and Chipotle Chicken Strips with Enfamil Lipil with Iron, Milk-based PotatoesCajun Roasted Mahi-Mahi with Fennel, Chives, and Enfamil Lipil with Iron, Milk-based Formula PowderEnfamil Lipil with Iron, Milk-based Formula-marinated Flank SteakFruit Salad with Cranberries, Enfamil Lipil with Iron, Milk-based Dressing, Walnuts and Feta Cheese."
1,Extremely disappointing!,"This book certainly doesn't reflect what the publicity said about it. It's mostly just a bunch of b&w stills from Lee's Hammer Dracula series that we've all seen 1000 times before (and not even reproduced very well, for that matter.) There are a total of 27 pages of text, most of which are plot summaries. I cannot too strongly warn experienced Hammer readers that you will feel more than a bit of anger upon purchasing this particular tome. I am going to be very wary of anything under the ""Glitter Books"" moniker in the future. Johnson & Del Vecchio's ""Hammer Films: An Exhaustive Filmography"" or the Rigby book are far superior on this subject, among just a few alternates to look for."
5,One of the best horse stories ever!,I can't tell you how many times I read this book as a child. Countless. So very well written. It was a joy to finally read it to my own child.
2,Okay Story---Horrendous Editing,"In the first 3 pages, there are scores of typos, including ""inseperatable,"" ""gong"" for going, and grammar mistakes that are so obvious, they should have been noticed. Just the use of a spell checker would have improved the book immensely. The sad part is, it may be a decent story, but I can't get through it with all these mindless mistakes. No one could have even glanced at this book before printing it and selling it. There is no excuse for this."
3,hmm,"the first hour of this movie satisfactorily grabbbed my attention, and based on the comments of other amazon customers, i expected it to improve considerably. it didn't.i knew a great deal of the movie would be conversations. unfortunately, most of them were rather banal. for substance, there was one glib quote by kierkegaard and one by kundera. some of the main character's reflections on the nature of relationship were somewhat insightful. however, most of the other talk centered, unfortunately, on the other characters' sexual ups and downs, which is not necessarily awful, if you like that sort of thing.aside from that, the acting was good, the actresses rather enchanting. although i did find the contrast peculiar, in the scenes in which they were totally nude and the males fully dressed, which was the standard within the film."
2,"disappointed, deeply...","This is a lovely film, at least it was when I saw its premier screening at the MFA in Boston. I loved the characters & dialogue, had been eagerly awaiting its appearance as/on a dvd, but, while it's here, the transfer/compression of it blows. The image quality's so poor & the colors incredibly bleached out. I wan my money back & or a better transfer (preferably). To whom do I bring my complaint to? Do the europeans lack for technology? A poor transfer was also done to another great (foreign) film, a Spanish one, titled ""Vacas"", which is a great film, though, not on dvd."
3,Poor video transfer?,"I sent the VHS version of this movie back largely unseen because the subtitles were so fuzzy. The overall video quality, in fact, I think is suspect. I look forward to watching this movie when it is successfully transferred to DVD."
2,And no sex in the whole three hours!,"What a disappointment! A formless first movie whose actors deserved better. Non-stop talk amongst intellectual types with all sex scenes, if there were any, edited out. Plenty of boy friend and girl friend talk but no romantic situations, and just a bit of nudity (by the actresses of course) in utterly non-sexual situations. The acting, especially by the women, was worth the couple of stars, but the hero and his friends are utterly charmless. The epiphany comes as a surprise without any rhyme or reason. The hero suddenly finishes his dissertation and voila, the girl of his dreams falls into his lap! No substitute for a good Eric Rohmer film."
1,Leaky Marker,"When I received the ordered markers, I tested them right away and they appeared to work fine. When I actually went to use them about 2 days later, the paint ran right thru the marker and puddled on my picture... Not trusting these paint markers anymore, I replaced them with regular sharpie markers."
3,"Looks nice, works fine, some minor issues, I'd give it 3.5 stars",Bought this faucet for my new sink and vanity. The overall look is nice but I have noticed a gap between the two halves of the faucet portion just above the aerator. I carefully took the piece apart and bent each half (carefully!) and it is a little better.The biggest issue I have with this faucet is that the aerator sprays water as if it is clogged. I have completely disassembled the aerator three times to ensure it is clean. There is some improvement but for the amount of money I paid for this I would expect the aerator to be as good as every other one I've seen/used (not to mention the fit/finish issue). Maybe I'll call Kohler for a replacement aerator in case this one is defective.
3,"Not bad, but not the best","For its size, this book, like all O'Reilly books, delivers the goods concisely. However, it shouldn't be relied upon for a complete reference. This book doesn't supplement practical experience, which is vital to passing any of the exams. Could have included real-world scenarios to put ideas in perspective."
4,Excellent for what it is - a review guide...,"My guess is many of the reviewers here either work for the author or are the famous ""paper"" MCSE types....""I got certified with no experience in 3 hours with this book..."" yeah ok...and your employer will hire me in a second when he finds out I'm backed with hands on REAL world experience. :) I'm a REAL MCSE, could pass the exams on just some books - but that's not what I want....experience, hands-on that is what matters not someone who just has a piece of paper from reading a book for a few nights. Get this as a review to SUPPLEMENT and do your CAREER one better than the yahoos who mock getting certified as ""just taking a test"".....This book is a review nothing more, but a good one."
2,Not a Study Aid!!!,Don't buy this book to study for the MCSE exams. This book does not go into any detail and only provides an outline for what needs to be studied. I have know idea why others rated this book so highly.
5,very clear writing. highly recommended,"this book is very clear, very easy to study from. It is my only hard copy studying material."
5,"Yep, everyone was right. Biggest BANG for the buck!","I bought this book, because of everyones' comments, and they were right. If you're an experienced administrator, this may be the only book that you need. I personally used it with other study guides, because this book does not contain everything. However, it is a good concise, no nonsense review for the exam. The Sybex guides are just a mammoth. If you already understand Windows NT, then all you need is this book and some practice questions, and you should be okay. By the way, I passed the 4 core exams in about 2 months."
5,O'Reilly does it again!,"Think you're ready to take the NT exams? GET THIS BOOK. You will not find a better last minute review anywhere (think MCSE Cliff Notes). Even if you plan to certify on the Windows 2000 track, this book is still incredibly helpful... you need to know something of NT to make the most of Win2K, and this book has no frivilous details.Aside from O'Reilly's reputation and the quality of the content, there is one other thing that makes me regard this book so highly: price. Most truly awful MCSE books cost twice as much!"
5,GREAT REVIEW BOOK Winnt4 Core Exams,"I'm probably sounding like a repeat of the other reviewers, but, this book is a great review/prep book for the MCSE NT4 Core Exams. The sections are concise and get to the point with the stuff you need to know to pass the exams!!If you are a novice, one piece of advice is to get LOTS of hands-on experience installing, configuring, troubleshooting, and administrating Windows NT! It's the only real way to make sure you will do well on the exams."
5,"Concentrated, to the point, excelent resourse","This book is an awsome resourse for material covered in detail in the Microsoft Press and other books on the MCSE certification. I have already ordered the ""MCSE - The Electives in a Nutshell"" and expect it to be just as inciteful. Very powerful tool!"
3,a general view of India's today,"It's a good product for people that are only searching for a general view of India. But if you are looking for something that goes deeply on India's soul, I would advice BBC series "" Ganges "" to see natural world or the marvellous BBC series "" The story of India "" from Michael Wood .Even the BBC series "" India "" from Sanjeev Bhaskar is better , because it's made with a lot of humour . I think there is nothing like the British to speak about and to show India . Because their feelings, their nostalgia for India are enormously deep . You could see that on the colour pattern wich they use to film the women's dresses of Rajasthan , or the desert of Thar , or even more on the way they film the Taj Mahal from Yamuna's river ."
2,Interesting but....,"Interesting, but overly emphasizes more fringe/exotic things and presents it as the soul of India. Also, kind of annoying that it's presented so much from an outsider's point of view - but I can see how that is useful to outsiders, also! He's such a tourist though - a tourist off the beaten path, but still such a tourist. I greatly preferred ""The Story of India"", which I think gives a better idea of the soul of India, and you can tell that filmmaker has spent enough time in India to truly love it and ""get"" it - he's not so touristy anymore."
5,The Soul of India,EXCELLENT CHOICE. LOVED THIS DVD. EXTREMELY WELL DOCUMENTED AND PHOTGRAPHED. INFORMATIVE. USEFUL IF PLANNING A TRIP TO INDIA. BEAUTIFUL COLOR. 5 STAR RATING FROM ME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. RRRRR
4,works great before it breaks,These really work great at cleaning primer pockets. After some use they do tend to break- the wires start spinning inside the holder and won't clean the pockets anymore. They are great while they do work.
2,An unfortunate ending to a fantastic series!,"This is the last book in the Dungeon series. Unfortunately, it does the other 5 no justice at all. The characters are not true to their nature, the setting is weak to say the least, and it's a shame such a good series couldn't amount to more than this!"
1,Do NOT read this book!,"This book is truly horrible. The story is mutilated, the plot (if there is one) makes no sense, and all characters save two or three are trivialized to worthlessness. Read books 1-5 of the Dungeon but DO NOT read this book unless you want to be extremely disappointed. I guarantee that your imagination, no matter how lacking, can think up a better ending for this series than Richard Lupoff did."
1,This is the absolute worst book I've ever read in my life.,The first five books in this series were average to good. This book ruined the entire series. I've read approximately 350 books in the science fiction/fantasy genre and this is by far the worst of them all. I can't believe Farmer actually approved this trash
3,Seem to be good shoes...,"I bought these shoes on 11.5 (not only for the excelent price, I do like Florsheim).To my regret they were smaller than they should be (number 11 equivalent perhaps?). Honestly I did not even try to change it, that's the reason I gave it 3 stars.The look is OK, but due the above mentioned reason I couldn't use them nor ""test them"" on the field."
2,Searching for success,"This is an interesting snap-shot of Bowie's earlier days, pre-Space Odditty, indeed pre-Laughing Gnome!, where a struggling artist and his various bands at the time were eager for a taste of fame and fortune. The sad fact of the matter is, that none of the tracks are particularly outstanding and understandably, they did not result in David Jones or his colleagues being catapulted into the limelight. However, if, like me, you are a fan of Bowie, then it could be no more than a bit of harmless fun to add this package to your collection.Incidentally, all the tracks crop up on various compilations which emerge from time to time, so unless you are a completist, it may be best to search around for a more complete compilation."
5,foxy fits,"Used this to make a Laika costume. so we only used the tail and the ears, but that said, they were superb."
3,good thing we only wanted the ears and tail,"About what I expected for the price. The skirt and boot covers are very cheap, the faux fur shrug seams were not sewn correctly, with sections unsewn leaving exposed arm. Bought it for the tail and ears, though, which are good for anime fans wnating to wear them."
5,A Mini-Masterpiece Worthy of Everyone's Attention,"I fell into this film quite by accident. How fortunate for me. Oh that I had a fraction of the insight, talent and brilliance Landreth has shown here. Buy it, watch it, think about it and then watch it again. You will be amazed at the art and animation, and you'll be equally moved by the novel ways in which Landreth depicts the scars of the human journey."
1,Not for me!!,"This movie was in no way entertaining to me. It was decent visually; However, The story was short and pathetic. It tried to be deep and engrossing but failed miserably. It was rushed along and didn't improve as the movie progressed. I perfer sub titles but the voice over for this film was done quite well. All the sexuality in the film was kind of over the top. All in all, i felt that it was cheesy and read out like a wannabe Stoker's novel."
1,Trash!,"One of Japan's flops which I'll proudly trump. This movie is [garbage]. I've seen the dub. But that doesn't change my opinion about the whole package. If you take a bathroom break during the middle you haven't missed anything. Too many flashbacks one rape scene.This movie is tasteless... The plot is pretty flat(if you can call it a plot that is). There is no drama,action or redeemable traits in this movieDon't waste your time or money on this..."
2,The manga is better.,"The anime would probably only appeal to fans of the original manga (comic.) For those not in the know, Kimera should be refered to as ""he"" rather than ""she."" I am not surprised the english released changed it to ""she."" though.Not being fluent in Japanese, I can only guess at the plot, but the manga is fun to look at."
2,short and pointless,"there is little to no romance in the story, though i did enjoy the baseline of it. short movie, graphics are a bit iffy, but on the bright side it is worth what i paid."
1,KIMERA is and anime joke!,"This is the most horrible Anime I'v ever seen! DONOT buy this tape! It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad! I only rented this movie thank god, and its a bad Vampire movie about Vampires from outter space. The women Kimera, looks horrible! When shown naked, which isnt even needed, she has a chest liek a male, nothing at all! Just a flat chest!"
1,"Sex,violence, nudity, no plot. Great Movie!","Get serious folks. If you want good anime I suggest you watch Ranma 1/2,Galaxy Fraulein Yuna and Project A-ko. This show is too bland....All I can say is watch Species and Species 2. The plot is more involving if not excellent. Kimera is a joke. Too many flashbacks. Too much dialogue and no action.If you skip the middle of the show you aren't missing anything. I've seen better plots in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. Watch some tried and true American Sci- Fi(live action shows) not this Japanimation drivel."
3,Government Secrets and Vampires!,"O.k. I definitely belive that this anime had some serious potential. Despite it's obvious ""Species"" plot rip off. The voice cast on this one is average. The animation in fair. Yet the story line will either have you laughing your head off or looking blankly trying to figure out what in the hell was ADV films thinking for releasing this film. Peersonally I had fun with short anime, considering it's running time is under an hour. The story focuses on a man whom gets involved with a government retrival of an alian space craft. Inside is beautiful woman whom isknown as Kimera. Yet with the other vampires trying to reclaim her it is a race against time to discover her past. Folks do not take this one seriously, it a waste of time if you do. No matter what you the ending will have you thank god for the eject button. Warning this film contains violence, some gore, language, breif nudity and a rape scene."
3,Strange. 'nuff said.,"Now here's quite a unique piece of anime. It starts off as horror, then slows down to a simple drama, then ends as a fantasy/action anime. Of this 60 minute film, the first 15 minutes were interesting and drew me in, the next 30 minutes went slowly by as the story slowed to a crawl, then the final 15 minutes were brilliant as the awesome final battle took place. Some of the art was just amazing, particularly the shattering stained glass window that Kianu emerges from. The fact that Kimera is a sexless being is kind of sick seeing as there is a strong romance with it and another guy in this story. Anyway, this is somewhat of an intellectual/gore/fantasy anime. I wouldn't know what kind of a recommendation to give this, as you can see with my overuse of slash bars. Rent it, see if it fits your tastes."
1,Not Worth It,"Im sorry but this movie was a disapointment, It really did leave you unfulfilled. I felt that the storyline and the animation was and is a major disapointment. Its about alien blood suckers that want to take over the human race. Extremely borrrriinnngggggg. I felt it should get a star for trying."
3,Not good with Canon EOS 30D,"I like Cokin filters and use them quite a lot. I think the quality is good and also like the fact that I can use them on multiple lenses with different filter diameters by changing only an adapter ring. The issue I have with this filter is more a function of the design of my camera (Canon EOS 30D). This camera has an Infrared cut-out filter that is intended to improve color rendition in the visible spectrum. This filter works well for this, but it makes infrared photography mostly useless. When using this filter it is necessary to take very long exposures, even in bright light (30 seconds or more). This makes it impossible to take photos of people and this also introduces a lot of noise in the image. Also, every image produced has a very strong, deep red color-cast as if I used an ordinary red filter. I would like to use this filter and get some interesting false color images, but it appears this is not possible."
4,one of Woolf's most exciting and experimental,"This book is not about what goes on outside the play so much as it is about Woolf's new expression of her continued criticism of English society. There is humor in the book. Her Victorian policeman is a biting and explicit critique of the sexism, racism, and general destructive intolerance that was actively supported by the Victorian imperialist discourse. I only wish she'd lived so we could see what she would have tried next."
1,usual british stuff,"if you love countryside, old women having tea every day at 5.00pm and chatting about weather reports and neiborhood's affair, this book is for you...if not, well, stay away!"
4,"HIGHTLY ENTERTAINING, BUT A BIT UNEVEN!","Having been in many bands I could easily identify with the group this film centers around. The film is quickly paced and pretty engaging, but I did find it a little uneven in tone at times. I don't want to give anything away, but I am rarely surprised when watching a film and this film does drop a bomb or two that I wasn't expecting.It's a fun film with some insight on the rough road of ""Rock'N'Roll"". It's no joke and even though I have had moderate success in the business, it's not easy being in a band no matter how successful you are! An interesting soundtrack and an honest look at band life even if it is pretty light at times, it does have it's dark moments."
5,very entertaining,"I saw this film well over a year ago at the Sundance Film Festival. It was very funny and often visually stunning. Proyas brings his intense and imaginative style to a simple romantic comedy about a garage band, resulting in a unique experience. The romantic aspect is not very strong, but I still give the film 5 stars (rounding up from 4.5). I plan to buy the DVD when it is released..."
4,DRUGS SEX & ROCK & ROLL!!! an australian point of view.?,"Plot: A not so talented band struggles with drugs sex and rock and roll. Yup that sums it up!! The acting and character development is very well done. You have the singer/guitar writer who dreams of being a star who has a girlfriend, the bass player, who is into someone else. The lead guitarist is having strange fantasies of sex and adopts a melon as a child meanwhile abandoning his girl who the singer digs, the drummer experiments with too many drugs while the manager is just plain crazy!!! Sound Interesting? Pacing of the movie reminds me a lot like Trainspotting. Better than i expected!!"
3,Not particularly useful,"I just took the 70-015 exam using this book as one of my source for preparation. This book does not address the main requirement, COM, enough. The 70-016 version of this book has even more coverage on COM. If you want to pass 70-015, I would suggest you either take 70-016 first, or use both this exam cram and 70-016."
4,Very good coverage of the exam,"I just passed the 70-015 exam, after reading (only) this book. It has quite a lot of detail, despite the small size.Most topis are well covered, but some are a little thin. COM is one of these, but after all it _is_ a huge topic, and even most COM-only books don't cover it that well. MTS, particularly security is not covered in enough detail. I had to guess on some MTS questions during the exam that I thought should have been mentioned in the book.Overall, this book is quite comprehensive, I managed to write over 180(!) pages of notes from it. With it, and some help from the MSDN documentation (and, of course, some braindumps) you should be well prepared for the exam.Good luck! :)"
3,Safety Glasses Pouch,"This pouch takes any size of safety glasses, with side bellows and adjustable velco closure. Completely padded on the inside, your glasses will never get scratched. I don't use the belt clip, instead I push it onto one of the outside pockets of my tool bag. The stainless steel clip is so deep and so strong, it doesn't get pushed off like my tape measure which is constantly getting left behind. It looks great, too; matches my Pro GateMouth bag. The negatives - If you use small (prescription?) safety glass, the pouch is way too big, and I think [the price] is too expensive."
4,Great ADO.NET Learning Book and Reference,"This is a very odd book in that eight of the chapters in this book cover ADO and nine cover .NET and ADO.NET (not including some extra chapters covering specific DB providers). You likely don't have much need for the ADO chapters, but the ADO.NET coverage is very good. The author gets to the point and has excellent step-by-step examples for both Windows Forms and ASP.NET. The later chapters give the best coverage I've seen for working with XML, reading XML from databases, synchronizing XML with datasets, etc. After reading it I still often refer back to this book as a reference."
2,rehash of ado book,This must be a rehash of an ADO book because it is full of ADO chapters and examples. Its like writing a book about commercial travel where most examples are about propeller planes - nothing wrong but most people today use jets and today almost all new Windows programming is about .net access methods.So save your money and go somewhere else. Its a shame the author did not rewrite the entire book - it could have been the classic ADO.NET book.
3,It has it's good points and it's bad points.,"These CD's are good and have helped me....but it is very redundant. They repeat a lot of the same words and phrases on each of the CD's, meaning that they will go over one word or phrase on CD 1 and they will go over the same word or phrase on each of the other CD's. They do this a lot. They also go over a lot of phrases you will never use when speaking the language. EXAMPLE: The Spanish translation of ""What are the days of the week"" and ""What are the months of the year"". You say the Spanish translation of these phrases to someone and they are going to look at you like your stupid! This is only a few examples of the useless phrases they use. But hey it is still good at teaching Spanish."
3,Not all changes are improvements...,"The original Speed Spanish cassette tapes were the most effective and most fun language classes I have experienced, better than live classes with a teacher, better than other CD's, tapes, or computer software.Somehow, using something the teacher called ""strategies"", I was able to use more Spanish, more effectively and easily, than I was able to converse in French, German, or Chinese. I really loved the original Speed Spanish tapes.The new Speed Spanish CD's, not so much. They have added a second voice, and seem to have replaced strategies with repetition and memorization. I did not give the CD's a very long chance. I tried to use these new CD's twice, and both times I became frustrated and bored, and I quit."
3,Full of errors - but a lot of information,"I've never read a book that was more poorly edited than this one. It's full of errors - typographical errors, formatting errors, even some errors in the code samples. It's not bad if you're able to recognize the errors and figure out what the author meant, but I wouldn't put this book in the hands of a beginning programmer.The book does have a lot of information in it though. Nearly 1000 pages with small print. The explanations could be better at times - the author frequently uses concepts that haven't been explained yet, which can leave the reader lost."
2,poorly written,"The book has much material, but the methodology is bad.The best methodology is to provide sample input, the code,and the output.The author in many cases provides just code with neither inputnor output. The reader therefore cannot validate his understand-ing against any kind of input.There are also lots of little errors."
3,"Not too terrible, but rather go to the authoritative source","I bought this book with virtually no knowledge of programming in Perl, and it seemed quite good, and indeed I think it makes for a good introduction/tutorial for Perl. However, having now read ""Programming Perl"" (O'Reilly) written by Larry Wall et. al. , I've decided that it is a much better book than this one. On that basis, assuming ""Programming Perl"" gets 5 stars, this one only gets 3."
3,"Fine idea, but needs a better glue binder","The pad serves it's purpose and I'll probably continue to use it, but the cardboard backing came off the tablet rather quickly. It seems that the glue used is rather weak."
3,LIVE IN BALTIMORE,"The Jackie McLean Quartet live in Baltimore 1966, with a rhythm section led by Lamont Johnson. I guess I didn't get a bum copy since the other reviewer has problems with the sound too. It might not be the sound as much as a somewhat abrasive tone he might have been playing with in the first place. Anyway, I can manage to listen to a couple of tracks in a row before moving on, although this is not a recomendation for younger fans who may do better checking out Ian Hendrickson Smith- UP IN SMOKE and STILL SMOKIN'"
5,Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 2 is great,"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 2 is a great book for teens because it is something we can relate to. It is filled with short anecdotes written by teenagers or once-teenagers about their adolescent experiences. It is inspirational and teaches us about who we are, about people, and about life in general. I recommend this book for all teenagers."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"This is the best book I have ever read. I loved th efirst one,and couldn't wait for the second one. I read the whoe book in one day, now I read one story each night. It inspires me for the life ahead of me. I read how unfortunite others life was, and how good it was also. I hope the good things happend to me hwen I read it! I love this book!"
5,Very facinating and fun to read!,"I recieved this book for Christmas from my mom and when I started to read Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II, I just couldn't put it down! The stories are written in such a great format it easy to just keep reading and reading! I love how there is great detail in all of the stories and how they all are ones that could change a person's life. I hope the authors write many more teenage chicken soup books!"
5,Chicken Soup really IS good for the soul.,I am glad someone finally wrote a book about things that really happen to us! These stories are truely insprational and I enjoyed every one of them. hte only thing I didn't like is that I'll have to wait so long for the third one!
2,First and Thrid were better,"This book really did not meet my expectations. I really did not learn anything like the cover implies I would, and the stories were all so tragic. I got depressed after reading it. Other that that it was okay."
2,"Doesn't compare to the first ""Teenage Soul"" book","I recieved both books for my birthday, the 1st on my 15th and the 2nd on my 16th. I read the 1st one at least 4 times front to back in about 3 months. I'm very sorry to say that the 2nd is no where near as good as the 1st. I got it in November now it's almost the end of January and still haven't finished it! It doesn't keep my attention like the 1st one did. I recomend spending your money on something more interesting."
5,Perfect Place for People,I love all of the stories in the book. I am only 12 and am going into my teenage life stage and it really helps me through the good and the bad times.
4,"I thought it was good, but not as good as the first one","I thought it was a pretty good book, but the origional Chicken Soup for the Teenage soul was still better."
4,A good book !,"This chicken soup for the teenage soul book wsa a good book, but personally I liked the first one better. All though this one had just has many good stories, for some reason all the stories from the first one seemed to be more touching. Don't get me wrong this is still a good book to read if you are looking for a inspiring story or just a book to read."
5,"""write"" on!","Sequels to books rarely surpass the original. Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is an exception. This book relates to teens better than any other! In fact, most stories in the book ARE written by teens themselves. Also the book includes an added bonus by including popular celebrities, such as Jennifer Love Hewitt and Andrew Keegan, in on the submissions! Being a 16 year old girl myself, I like to know that I am not the only one out there going through different obstacles. I recommend purchasing this book right away!"
5,This book is very inspirational!,It has stories of real kids and real life events that help you to understand that there are other people in the world going through the exact same situation. It lets you know your not alone in the world. I also love how the authors include famous quotes and poetry that sort of follow the story. I think this is a great book!!!
4,"Sad, sad, sad!","Every time I read a Chicken Soup book, I end up crying my eyes out... not just while reading, but for hours afterwards. It's a great book, but the stories are just too sad."
5,A paper best-friend,"To put it succinctly, this book and the stories within it have become one of my constant companions, a place to go for advice, understanding, and inspiration. It has comforted me in my lows and shared my highs. All in all, a very useful tool for a girl experiencing adolescent turmoil."
5,One of the greatest books of all time,"I've read both of the chicken soup for the teenage soul books, and I have to agree that they are both helpful for advice. Whenever I feel down I just read a story out of one of the books and I feel a lot better. I'd like to submit a story to the publisher. If anyone knows where I can send one just e-mail me the address at fine_mixed_chic@yahoo.com"
5,An inspirational book,"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul ll is a great book written by teenagers and some adults about life. It teaches us about life and how to deal with it. It shows us that no matter where you came form, what you look like, or how you act, almost all teenagers are the same. This book is an inspiration to everyone.This book influences me because it inspires me to become a better person. Before I read this book I thought, ""Oh this book is just some boo full of made-up stories"", but as I continued to read into it more, I thought"" Wow this is a really great book"". This book tells you that all teens go through the same stuff. It shows you that your not alone, and with faith and courage you can overcome most obstacles. This book is filled amazing stories of love depression, and hope. I encourage everyone to read this book."
4,A book for your soul,"A book for your soul...Wow! This is a fantastic book! You should definitely read this book for a good read. It has a good aspect of reading because these situations are things that have happened from real life teen situations, so many teens can relate to the stories.The authors range from pre-teens, teenagers, or maybe even adults. The audience target is for teenagers.A supersonically good reason to read this book is that it has many short, heart-touching stories, and is very great to read if you have something to do. That way you can stop reading and start off with a new story without having to remember what important events happened before you put the book down.So in conclusion this is a GREAT book to read!"
5,One of the best books I have read in a long time!!!,"This book is and the first one are two of the best books when it comes to real personal experience to things that happen to teenagers, not just something that your parent or parents give you a lecture on. Teens need more than just an ""Because I say so"" opinion, they need someone who can empathize with them. They also need reason when something goes wrong. This book is what you need to get your teen. It is a book for any occasion. It is even a just because gift. This could really help your teen in the long run."
5,This book is wonderful,today at school I was bored so I started reading my friend's Chicken Soup For the Teenage soul volume 2. It moved me close to tears! I was suprised how touching it was since i never cry. I think everyone should experience reading this book.
1,Broken File,I have downloaded this thing a dozen times. There is nothing here but a few lines of the table of contents and that is in Latin. There is something wrong with the file.
1,"This is NOT the Shoaf Edition of Troilus and Criseyde, it is a collection of essays!","Please be careful! Everything on this page gives you the impression that this is a hardcover version of Shoaf's edition of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. IT IS NOT - IT DOES NOT EVEN CONTAIN THE POEM. This is a collection of essays about the poem that is really only suited to Chaucer scholars. Don't make the same mistake I made. It should be subtitled - ESSAYS - or have some other clear description of the nature of the book. I can not evaluate the essays, because I haven't yet read the poem because of this mis-identification of these Essays with the Superior Shoaf edition of Troilus and Criseyde by Chaucer."
2,Lighting,"The size listed says this light is 18, yes I did say it says eighteen inches. That is the size I need. Now when it gets here it is only 12 inches. Misrepresented is the only word that comes to mind. I am contacting Amazon to find out about this. Since this is obviously not the same as the one I am replacing (too small) I am not unpacking this light till I get a response from Amazon. It is a nice looking light."
4,Just ok for this lightning,"This florescent light is just OK, but the light is not very bright, and also it seems a bit short for use.Anyway it helped enhancing the light strength in my bedroom. Thank you!"
3,Cord issue,"The product is fine for modest under-the-counter lighting -- reasonable price, easy to mount. However, the light-fixture end of the cord fits very loosely into the light, without necessary tension to keep it snugly in place. Consequently, any ""jiggle"" disconnects the light. Before installing, you may want to test the cord to be sure the tension is there for a snug fit."
3,Fair lamp at fair price,"This light was bought as a gun cabinet light. It is small enough to do the job well without interfearing with the rest of the room{14 gun cabinet}. One thing to consider. This is similar to the old ""lights of america"" brandand comes with the dull 27K bulb. If you want whiter light plan to spend $3-5 for a 47k-51k light which I did. Time will tell on the lenght of service. It does run warm but not too hot so it keeps the cabinet dry. No shipping troubles and it does have an on/off switch."
2,bulb is awful,"This light comes with a bulb that is a terrible color. If you want to get a better bulb, they cost more than the fixture itself. The light works and it does link together nicely, but the yellow brown color of the light means it is turned off nearly all the time."
4,Legends...,"This album is good...not my first choice for the Willie and Waylon stuff...first would be the Outlaws album with Willie, Waylon, Jessie Colter and Tompaul Glaser...second would be Willie and Waylon's-Take it to the Limit..."
2,Disapointing CD from two of my favorites,"I had never seen this cd before finding it while browsing on Amazon. After listening to it, I now know why. What a disapointment. Weak songs that sound like leftovers from previous recording sessions. Don't waste the time with this one"
3,Decent guidebook but author's disregard for spelling is offensive,"This book is helpful and provides a plethora of information, but it is bound to offend Arizona natives, because of its blatant diregard for spelling of some of our most beloved places and plants. Charles A. Wells goes to great lengths to provide details about trails, but somehow forgets to CQ the spelling of such Sonoran words as Saguaro which he repeatedly spells ""Suguaro."" He also gets the name wrong for one of our most lovely locales: Chiva Falls, which he spells ""Chivo Falls."" I hope that in future editions of this book he will respectfully correct such errors. I would gladly offer my services as copy editor for any future endeavors at a reasonable rate."
4,Guide to Arizona Backroads and 4 wheel drive,"This book is a good starter for the person who doesn't know any locals in the area to take them 4 wheeling. I have a stock SUV and have done 4 trails, it was great fun. The book provides GPS coordinates to help with trail finding, however they seem to be off by about a mile or two. Perhaps the Waypoints were taken when selective avaliability was still active. I would rate this book as a 5 if the Waypoints were accurate. Trail finding is made somewhat easier by the accurate turn by turn directions based on odometer readings.All in all, if you want a beautiful tour of Arizona that not many people get, get this book and see the sights. Go with a buddy and take some moderate trails. Eventually you will catch yourself wanting to lift your rig, and get lockers for it too."
5,Dynamic,"I remember Scheherazade being played on our stero when I was a child, which is why I bought it. This arrangement is powerful. I love it."
5,BETTER than Hollywood.,"Comparing The Losers to a Hollywood movie does it a great disservice. The dialogue in most movies doesn't even come close to what Andy Diggle serves up in this poignantly paranoid and timely series. He's Tarantino with talent. Scorcese with restraint. And Jock's bristling visuals absolutely jump off the page, bringing each character and location and emotion distinctively to life. Hollywood analogies fall short here. The Losers is a must-own, not just for fanboys and action-junkies, but for anybody that appreciates great graphic storytelling."
3,Jerry Bruckheimer movie in Graphic Novel form,"I'm only a casual comic reader, but since I've start reading them again as an adult I look for intelligent and innovative story telling and great artwork. The artwork in this book was very good (in that heavy, dark inking kind of way). The story, however, was right out of a Bruckheimer film and for that reason it didn't live up to what I expect out of adult comics. All action and little substance.I won't be picking up the next book in the Losers series. I much prefered the Sleeper series, which is in a similar genre."
2,You need the compass to FIND the thermometer!,"Brunton Compasses are GREAT. This one is no exception. Larger than the normal Zip o gage,but not too large. The thermometer is another story. I have bought 4 over the last year. The thermometers have fallen out of three of the four. Apparently Brunton doesn't think there is a problem according to the gentleman I corresponded with, since there is no plans for a re model. They were very friendly and sent me four new thermometers to replace the lost ones so their customer service is good. You'll need it.LOL"
5,Amazing!,"As my favourite photographer, Cartier-Bresson has some kind of impayable discernment. His gallery of Paris is his magnum opus. His Leica, his 50mm lens, his mysterious face... all made him a monumental legend. I bought this gallery (hardcover) in 1995 for the price of $US 50 in Hong Kong. What are you waiting for? Just click it and buy it immediately, you will never regret buying this book."
2,"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","I'm new to the world of VPN. This book laid some ground work for me to start with. The other reviews consider this book as usless, but now after having read this book, I now have a basis to gauge other work by. After all, as another review stated, there is not much new material out there."
2,Could have been a lot better - 2nd Edition soon?,"Rather lightweight and banal. This book could have been a lot better; had the impression that it was rather rushed, perhaps in an attempt to catch the VPN/ NT wave. There are some technical inaccuracies which is just not on in an introductory book. The book just about saves itself with its ""manual type"" content."
1,Crap for newbies,"I am badly suprised. I have 2-3 months VPN experience and know MUUUCH more than author of this ""research"". Waste of money, I will think before purchasing O'Reilly books in future"
3,A solid solutions-based book,"Wow. Someone is unhappy that O'Reilly publishes NT books. Though most of the solutions covered in the book did not apply to my company, it definitely presented the options in a clear, concise manner. We are investigating using a VPN for our NT/UNIX network, and the chapters on PPTP and the PIX were excellent. The overview chapters were helpful, though there could be more on software solutions other than the few presented."
1,O'Reilly has succumbed to making $$$ versus making quality,"I agree with all the statements made by the reader from Atlanta. Several of the things mentioned in the book indicate that it was written at least 9 to 12 months ago. Chapter 7 is so full of errors on IP address assignments that the text is very confusing when trying to follow along with the figures. Through out the book the text is not aligned with the figures and in one case the figure is outright in error. When looking at the back of the book to see what background the authors have, they should stick to driving tanks and management. They have definitively proven they can not constuct a nework and shouldn't. O'Reilly had a good reputation with its Unix books. A damn shame they have destroyed it with this window oriented book. Perhaps O'Reilly should give up on Windows books since they did not even do a perfuntionary Quality Audit of this one."
1,Waste of money!,"I can't believe O'Reilly published this book. This book was published in March '98 and appears to be written at least 12-18 months ago. If you are looking to build a VPN using Alta Vista's or Cisco's product (older versions, of course) this book may be a good introduction for you. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about VPNs. You can find white papers that are better and more up-to-date on the Internet (and they're free). I wish I could get my money back for this one!"
1,waste of money,"I bought this book on an impuse. I assumed that since it was an oreilly book it would have some decent technical content and perspective. But was I wrong, the book starts with a minimal overview of VPNs one could pick up on the web in 5 minutes, a bunch of screen captures of setting up windows NT's VPN, a short chapter on using ssh, and a chapter on altavista's tunelling product.. I would have expected at least balanced and comparable results between each approach but, for example, the ssh chapter goes into the end performance of that approach but this evaluation isn't present for windows nt. In short there is no technical detail in this book and the information that is there would be just as easily (and much less expensively) found on the web.Boo hiss."
1,Innacurate and old,"I didn't check out the publication date of this book when I bought it (1998) so my dissapointment is partly my fault. It is, unsuprisingly, very outdated (anyone actually remember the altavista tunnel?). However, much of the info that remains, even general VPN fundamentals, are flawed and innacurate.

1,BAD book....O'Reilly! 2nd Edition!,"I so agree with ""This book is a blot on O'Reilly's reputation. The editor(s) must have been asleep"". I have many O'Reilly books, and they all are good...but not this one. I trusted the O'Reilly's editors. So I ordered this book before it was published. I wish I had the chance to read the reviews...."
2,Look for a better book,"What was O'Reilly thinking!! This is the first time I wasted money on an O'Reilly book (and I have plenty). This book was a rush job. There are many inaccuracies, a lot seem to be the editors mistakes. The authors seem to have the practical experience, but it is not communicated in a clear manner. The chapters on PPTP, AltaVista and Cisco PIX were organized in a good way and were helpful. Overall, the diagrams are poor. Better graphics could have salvaged this book. I give it two stars because there are not that many books on the market."
4,Fun yet profound,"On the surface, this small collection of poems about God's everyday life seems like a cute gimmick, an entertaining diversion, but nothing of real substance. But this is one of those books that has the potential to get into your head and really make you think. The free verse makes the book a quick read, but you'll definitely still be thinking about it after you turn the last page.Recommended to anyone with an open mind."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a new genre for my 5th grade daughter, and I picked this book, normally a huge fan of Rylant. I found the cover statement &quot;soft, reflective and often humorous&quot; to be totally untrue. The book was disturbing in an offensive way. I didn't find any humor at all. The God she tries to know is not the God I know. It seemed very disrespectful. I've read better books that touch on the attributes of God in a loving, funny, soft way while opening the reader's eyes to the possibility of being inside God's mind. Rylant missed the mark in a big way this time. I will continue to read her work, and I hope that it will reflect growth, especially in this area."
5,a great book,"I loved the whole idea of God being ""normal"", that he had a cold, that he would like someone else to have dinner with (because communion is just not the same as having dinner) I read this twice, smiled, thought, grinned, giggled. what a neat way of humanizing the Man Upstairs!"
2,I Enjoyed the message but it keeps getting stuck in my VCR from the very first time I viewed it.,"I chose to give it a two-star rating only because the teaching was excellent. The problem is that the tape keeps getting caught in the VCR player and when I can finally distract the tape from the VCR without ripping it, I have to bang the sides of the tape to make it go back in. I do not have this problem with my other VHS tapes, so I know it is the quality of this tape...which was the last one the seller had. I tried playing it one other time, again with the same results."
3,hmmm,"This is not a little bullit, its an egg with attitude. the problem is you have to shut the windows to avoid wakeing the neighbors"
2,not strong enough,"not strong enough, wife don't like. we been using bullet for many years, this one just don't have the strengh."
4,Oh hell yeah!,"This little thing is powerful! The pulsating modes are fantastic, and powerful, and it has a gentler mode if that's what you're in the mood for as well. It really gets the job done well!"
3,It does the trick,"I keep relacing this massager, I find that it has a life of about 3-6 months. I have been told I over use mine but it is very cheaply made toy (probably made in some factory for 10 cents each unit) but amazon offers it at the low low price of $11 bucks and you can't beat that price anywhere online and certainly not in a speciality store. So, if you are looking for an inexpensive toy that will hit the spot, this is it."
4,"It REALLY works, but, lasted only 4 months...",I agree with the other users who said they have to replace often. I'm here to order another one since mine quit working. I had it only 4 months. Aside from that...WOW!!! Best I've ever had!!!
1,Disappointing - no 9V battery - uses 2 x AA - CRAP,This is NOT as advertised. These 'massagers' are cheap for a reason. It says it is a 9V battery and that it is included. It doesn't even take 9V battery -- takes 2 AA which = no power. Don't waste your time.
1,Try TLC instead,I wasted my money on this item. With brand new batteries it never reached full vibrating potential. We even tried several batteries. It was as if it was already warn out and it had a bad odor. My dh cut the cord to assemble it with an old one we had hoping it was reach full vibrating potential and it still did not. Now I surely can not return it. Money lost. This company surely did get over on us. Never again.
3,Kite not quite done,"I liked Kite Remastered and was looking forward to Kite Liberator. I like most of the artwork, style, mood, and choices the director makes. The action scenes are good and the characters, although not totally fleshed out, are believable. I liked Kite Liberator all the way to the end and then said to myself, is that the ending?! Did the animators run out of money and just say, okay it's finished? Because it didn't seem to be finished. It seems to end just before the climax should start to begin, and several things are left unresolved. This could have been a real classic dramatic animation."
1,This movie [is terrible]!,"I read hte book and saw the movie, and ""Charlotte's Web"" [is terrible], including the pig, crying like a big baby because a spider dies, and if this ever got an award, I give it ""Dummest book of the year."" I give this * (1 out of 5)."
5,I love this film,"I have CHARLOTTE`S WEB in a beautiful edition illustrated by Garth Williams and recently watched this absolutely wonderful film adaptation of E.B. White`s classic story. This is a film everyone should see, children and adults alike. It fills you with a variety of genuine emotions. The voices (Debbie Reynolds, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Lynde, Henry Gibson, among other fine actors) are perfect. I know I will see it many times still and always with great enjoyment, because it is technically perfect and has a truly meaningful, timeless message."
5,Kids LOVE IT-better than the new version.,"I bought this for my kids after we read the book. All of my kids age 2, 4 and 6 love it. To me, all the old stuff is much better than the modern versions. Gotta love the classics."
3,WHAT?!! No bonus features?!,"Okay, all right, sorry if I had to *slam* such an wonderful, endearing classic (which it happens to be, for the record, so no sarcasm intended here), but what I don't get or understand is how Paramount could push something like this WITHOUT any bonus features (commentaries, behind-the-scenes info, and so on). I even once read where Debbie Reynolds said it took her two to three days for her to record the voice of Charlotte.Ever since 1973 (when CW first came out), children's TV/movies have taken nothing but a severe nose-dive, to the point where all you see nowadays is TOTAL CRAP. Who cares how Saturday morning-ish CW was, in terms of animation and the voice cast? All it shows is the versatility of both put out by Hanna-Barbera; there are probably those of us who don't seem to realize how good we had it then!!"
3,Mostly unobjectionable,"All I can say is casting Paul Lynde as Templeton the rat was a stroke of genius. Can you say *C*A*M*P* Boys and Girls?But the queeny sub-text will escape the intended audience, so not to worry Mom and Dad.E. B. White would probably object to most of the changes made here, but compared to the execrable and unconscionable changes made to his ""Stuart Little"" it is not even comparable and sticks somewhat to the original text.However, I strongly recommend that this story be reserved for five to seven year olds, for the theme of death of a loved one from the perspective of an innocent may be too much to bear for younger viewers.But if you can avoid watching this until you've read the original E. B. White story to your children you will have given them a treasure of memorable American narrative prose."
4,works great,The dvd works great like i was told it would and i recieved it in good time. My daughter loves it and has prob watch it 20 times already.
5,Classic!,A timeless classic! Loved it back in the day and still enjoy watching it with my children now. Reminds me of when times were much simpler and childrens movies were just that...childrens movies! Movies now are boarder line adult material. Great movie!
3,OK but read book first - far better!,"Read book first, then show kids the movie - it'll make it all fall into place for them and round out the experience. My 3 grandkids liked it after they heard the story."
5,good,"I really like children's videos that stay true to the books by which they were inspired. This video does not change or deface E.B. White's classic book, which is one big reason why it's so good. It's just like the book coming to life. Very well done and child-friendly."
5,Loved the movie,I bought the movie to share with my grandchildren. Ican't wait for them to see it when they come visit.
5,a classic,"This original Charlotte's Web is true to the book. As an elementary school teacher, I love reading my students this book, then watching the movie. This older version is the one I fell in love with as a child and in my opinion is way better, and closer to E.B. White's version than the 2K release. The songs are adorable and it holds my first grader's attention. 5 stars for Charlotte's Web!"
4,"""Some movie!""","Wilbur (voiced by Henry Gibson) is a porker with a problem: He was born the runt of the litter and to the farmer (John Stephenson), he's not worth the price of feed. The farmer's daughter Fern (Pamelyn Ferdin) steps in and raises Wilbur as a pet. Eventually the hapless curly-tail is sold to the Zuckerman Farm, where he meets an interesting assortment of characters: There's a rude ram (Dave Madden), a gabby goose (Agnes Moorehead), and a ravenous rat (Paul Lynde) named Templeton; but lonely Wilbur finds a true friend in the kindly, wise spider who lives in an upper corner of the pigpen. The spider is called Charlotte (Debbie Reynolds) and once she learns that sweet and shy Wilbur is in danger of becoming bacon bits, she spins the words ""Some Pig!"" in her web.Sweet story, soft and gentle animation, cleverly-written but sometimes annoying songs.Staci Layne WilsonAuthor ofAnimal Movies Guide"
4,Great for preschool aged kids,"Most movies are too scary for preschool aged children. But Charlotte's Web is perfectly tame and enjoyable. There is death, but it is presented as sad, not scary. This is the only video that my 3-year-old doesn't need to fast-forward through parts of. And, of course, she loves watching it."
1,"Picture remastering poor, sound mono as if from a synd tape","They need to take a new transfer from Paramount's original interpositive, and remix the music and effects tracks into Stereo utilizing Paramount's original 3-track music and effects masters as they did for Paramount's other classic treasure, Willie Wonka.This DVD is only better than it's 12-inch LaserDisc cousin due to the widescreen transfer. However, the color is poor, the print they took the transfer from appears severely damaged in several places, the film jitter and weave is completely unwatchable. The sound is monaural and appears to be color-matched and sound equalized to look and sound good on the TV's of the early 70's when the film came to home video the first time. It's as if someone played a 16MM classroom print of the film on a classroom projector, aimed a camera and a microphone at the classroom projector and then used that for the DVD master."
5,A very valuable book,"I just got this book yesterday and am already more than half way through-it keeps you moving along and wanting to read each following chapter. i have no prior experience in telesales (or any sales) and this book has answered a lot of questions for me already. every time a question comes up, it seems it is answered within the following few chapters. the book is orgainzed very well and i can see how its suggestions will help me when i start my new job. i am very eager to put them to use!"
4,Helped me understand the art,This is a good buy for telesales reps. What is disheartening is that many organizations want you to do it there way so you can't use all of the techniques. I have read many other books on sales and telesales- this stacks up as one of the better ones
2,OK Book... Just Touches Surface,I don't know... I guess I was expecting more from this book. After reading Telesales Tips From The Trenches (Catal) and How To Sell More In Less Time (Sobczak) this was kind of a let down.
1,Hughes should stick to Acting,"This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true ""fiction"" and the parallels between her main ""villain"" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit."
3,No central story!,"I desperately wanted to like this book, but there was no unifying plot, no centralized story. It had interesting characters and some insightful moments, but the book never follows through with any of its characters or ideas. Overall, it felt flat and was quite disappointing."
2,Such a disappointment,"Oh my how I really wanted to like this book. I am a person that with a good storyline and great writing I could read a book in a day's time; it took me over a month to get through this book and I was on vacation for a week!!I found it very difficult to follow and to keep track of the players when we are constantly waffling back and forth between real names and stage names. And I feel there were too many characters to keep track of but I guess that's just the way with a soap opera.I also found the story to be quite depressing. I felt bad for the lead character but then she's going to turn around and do the exact same thing to her best friend?Maybe I was not taking the book in the light it was intended, maybe I missed the boat but this one sank as far as I'm concerned."
3,Lots of Reading,"I bought this for my son when he first moved out and kept calling me with cooking questions. If you like to read with no pictures of the food your attempting to cook then this book may work for you. My son looked at it and was overwhelmed with how large and thick the book was from the outside and once he opened it, he said he would get inspired to cook after the reading he had to go through."
5,Ben Cooks,"I selected this book for my grandson who is now living at school. My reason for selecting this book is based on the fact that at dinner one night before he left for school, he asked his mother ""How do you make ice?"" Apparently he has led a sheltered life so far. He is now settled in his apartment and he tells me he is learning alot about cooking he didn't know existed. I plan on doing the same for my other grandchildren when they venture out into the real world."
4,Agree with the trashers but...,"I saw this movie years ago, and somehow it sticks with me. I do agree with the critical reviewers; the ""hero"" as such, has little to redeem him or the movie. That said, I like it. The lead is charming and I want to see him redeemed. I know quite a few ""float along"" kind of guys and girls... long past college, with no driving force. This guy is representative in his way. If you do not have expectations that are too high, the film is small, quirky and a bit charming. Enjoy."
5,Aweso movie!,"This movie is great. It brings us a lot of memories about who we were and how stupid we were when young. It's one of those independent movies that never had a lot of fuss about it, but it's an awesome movie to have it and share with someone special. It's a movie that lifts up your spirits and makes you feel good after whatching it."
3,Dao of please!,"I'm named Steve, so even with that vested interest in this movie being cool, I cannot honestly say it is. It has a neat premise, an overweight guy who has figured out how to sleaze his way into bed with unsuspecting women, who also has a part time job with kids and a marujana problem, finally gets his when an old fling causes him to do a double take and rethink his life. While they were filming though, the director was struck by lightning (judging soley by the film) mid-scene and was subsequently replaces by a sack of bananas. The bananas then saw fit to open a dictionary and a book of quotations from the worlds great philosophers and complete the movie based on random picks out of the two. All kidding aside, the movie is only sort of funny, with no laugh out loud scenes to speak of, and only a few that make the movie watchable. It's your call."
2,"A slow, tedious movie about a lumpish loser","I rented this movie because a lot of people said it was sooooo good. It's not. It follows the exploits of a doofy guy who lives with a bunch of other slackers and dolts, and shows his semi-pathetic efforts to win back a woman he had an affair with long ago. It's not a horrible movie, but it isn't really very good, either."
4,All men should practice Taoism,"""The Tao of STeve"" is a comedy in which, Dex(not STeve, so who is steve?), played by the hilarious Donal Logue(That taxi driver guy that used to be on MTV). He certainly doesn't fit the ""romantic lead"" like Richard Gere, but he does stand out. He's the type of guy us normal women would date seeing as Richard Gere would just be way out of our league. The title of the movie is based on the way Dex ""gets"" women to go for him, and ""Steve"" is for all the cool Steves, the coolest being STeve McQueen. He's trying to be cool, trying not to let these women know his ulterior motives or motive. This movie was very entertaining. Despite The brooklyn reviewer's opinion, I thought the movie was well written. It was like listening to any guy talk of his ways to get women whether it involves isms' or not. If you are looking for a modern day comedy, this is a good choice. It certainly worth the rental fee."
3,"Semi-enjoyable, but weak","Yet another film in which the male lead is a schlub, of sorts, who pursues women much better looking than him, with success, due to his ""Tao"" philosophy of appearing to be detached from the pursuit. This is a very low-budget indie film with unknown actors. The script is okay. I paused this repeatedly for the first 45 minutes because it just wasn't compelling enough to watch steadily. It does pick up a bit. No surprises. Pleasant viewing for when you don't need big-budget Hollywood."
5,Little gem of a film,"We watched this when it first came out on DVD and thought it was pretty darn funny and surprising - one of those ""let's just see if it is any good"" movies - and it indeed was - so after all these years I thought it was great enough to buy and want to share with friends. Buy it! You won't be disappointed"
2,Couldn't watch,"I started trying to watch this and couldn't get more than 20 minutes in. Others my find it a good movie, but it was hard for me to enjoy. Other similar titles I like are Alfie, Californication, Fight Club, Choke, etc."
2,Boring......,"I had heard a lot of good things about this movie. I thought it was going to be good, funny, look at dating. I was hoping for a regular guys kinda of swingers. Instead, well it was just plain boring. I really wanted to like this film. No such luck."
2,[two and a half stars] Hawai'i Five-0's Steve McGarrett gets re-immortalized in here...,"Vulgar, sloppy Donal Loge (last seen ascomplainer in Mel Gibson's film 'The Pa-triot', plays stoner and womanizing slouch,who happens to be kindergarten teacher (!!),who gets wake up call while trying to charmthe pants (literally) off John Goodman's reallife wife! He meets his match and learns a fewthings along the way. All-American Steve's getlooked up to in here; especially Steve McGar-rett! Horay for that, otherwise this sort ofdull film would get two star rating from moi!"
2,something to pass the time,"i guess i was expecting the cinematic equivalent of -the tao of pooh-, which this is not. silly me.this is basically another movie about what men do to get women to have sex with them, along with a typical dysfunctional i'll-be-miserable-without-you love story.i did like the characters,acting,and the scenery,so that's something.it's a pleasant movie to kill some time."
1,Uninteresting,"Probably the most boring book I've read in the last three years. Gambling addiction could make an exciting story. I've never heard of this author, but he is very skilled in taking a moderately interesting topic and making it absolutely boring. Stock characters and stereotypes are also very frequent."
1,RoboHelp 2000 for HTML Help,"I was greatly disappointed with this book. It is poorly organized, and unclear. It takes an application that should be learned fairly easily and makes it that much harder.When there are multiple ways of doing the same thing, the author lists them in a numbered list which leads you to believe there are mulitple steps involved. Here's one example:""Creating a New Window""""To create a new window, you perform the following steps: 1. Select File, New, Window. 2. Right-click over the Windows folder on the Project tab. 3. Select File, Project Settings. Select the Windows tab and then click New.""These are listed as 3 steps, but in fact are just 3 different ways of doing the same thing.This is just one illustration of poor organization within this entire book."
4,Eastern front historical fiction.,"Fictional account of Eastern front combat circa 1941-1942 prior to Stalingrad as seen through the eyes of front line combatants. The principal story line follows a group of Panzer grenadiers, their ranks shrinking as they fight their way back to the front lines after escaping captivity. On rejoining their unit they return to the futile and brutal frontline combat that diminishes their ranks further. The author also includes the parallel stories of a group of Cossacks who revolt against the brutish behind-the-line abuse of Russian peasants by the NKVD, and a group of peasant villagers who revolt against both the NKVD and marauding partisan fighters. I have read a lot of accounts of eastern front combat and this fictional account is a very accurate portrayal. Also convincing and entertaining is the way the author depicts the brotherhood and constant humor within the grenadier ranks throughout their nightmarish odyssey. Recommended for eastern front war buffs."
4,Nice but tedious,I liked the central theme of the book and it is a 'must read'.However Jared could have delved into a little less detail; I found myself skimming through sizeable portions of the book.
2,The Usual Diamond Drivel,"More nonsense from the opportunist at UCLA. The same imbecile who claimsthat the Malayo-Indonesian language group originated in Taiwan(and not Sumatra where it is obviously came from), China is thesource for ALL East AND Southeast Asian civilizations and moreblather. Avoid Diamond's books like the plaques he pontificatesabout....."
1,Spurious Parallels,"An excellent book when it comes to examining the collapse of ancient societies. Less convincing when it comes to drawing parallels with the modern era. Parallels drawn are spurious, with hidden assumptions that must be accepted on faith. As an ode to the religion of Environmentalism, it is well written. As a work of reasoned argument and scientific evidence, it is lacking."
4,Jump to conclusions,Prof. Diamond has an unparalleled expertise in anthropological research and the interaction between societal and political factors and environmental and evolutionary changes. That combined with his lucid writing style makes this a great book.Don't be distracted by the sensational title; this book is an impressive resource of research on societies ancient and present and the compilation and distillation of this data is remarkable.However you might find yourself disagreeing with some conclusions drawn from this data. That I suppose is what a good book is all about.
3,Fails To Make The Case,"I understand why the book appeals strongly to the environmental catastrophe-minded, and it covers quite a bit of interesting history in areas which are not often addressed, but overall it is lacking. When I first glanced at the table of contents I wondered why the author was remarkably selective in the collapses covered, but it is apparent afterwards. The societies discussed are what almost every reasonable historian would consider minor players in human history. Intense overpopulation in areas of limited resources is bound to create catastrophic problems- that's a no-brainer. Tracing every problem to environmental depredation is pretty short-sighted and hardly objective. Collapses of much larger and more important civilations could be covered and those failures are rather more complex issues."
5,Extraordinary,"Professor Diamond's impeccable credentials as a scientist and a writer were well established with GG&S. If you felt entertained, or better yet, enlightened, by his last book, you'll love this one. Collapse feels like almost a sequel, in which he turns his attention from the function of ancient societies to ours today. If you aren't startled into some serious thinking about modern society today after reading this well-researched, smoothly-written book, it isn't Diamond's fault - it's your own."
4,A good wake-up call,"A very interesting book -- and one that, if people can get past its somewhat daunting length, contains a lot of wisdom. It's easy in this high-tech age to look back at the Maya, the inhabitants of Easter Islands, and other civilizations that have done themselves in through overpopulation and overall ecological misjudgment and say, ""That can't happen to us. We'd see it coming and do something about it."" In truth, though, I think civilizations all balance on a knife edge, and an ecological catastrophe can push them over that edge -- a drought, an earthquake, land that has been grazed or cultivated to exhaustion. We drive from our climate-controlled homes or offices to the grocery store where an abundance of foods unequaled in history awaits us -- and we don't realize how easily the system could fall apart. ""Collapse,"" while overlong and a bit windy at times, is an important book. Doubtless the Maya thought their civilization was impregnable, too."
5,A Very Good Examination of A Society's Impact on the Environment and Vice-Versa,"This book gives an in-depth examination of both ancient and modern societies reviewing how the societies started, developed, and ultimately either succeeded or failed. Knowing what the earlier societies faced and how they dealt with them demonstrates that some problems are universal and do not always have a set response.A very eye-opening part of the narrative is when he speaks of the Norse settlements on the coast of Greenland and how he shows that societies can be motivated by other causes than self-preservation which can lead to the society failing for reasons that it did not need to.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to look beyond the history books (for ancient societies) or the newspaper headlines (for current societies) for understanding the underlying causes and effects of these societies."
2,Do NOT buy on your Kindle,"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised EditionThis is a fascinating book, but do not buy it on the Kindle.The text references a series of plates, and images. Most of them are not included on the Kindle version.None of the hyperlinks work.I feel like I bought the book but many of the pages are blank.I am sure it is a much better read in print.I am used to the many annoying typographical errors, but leaving out content is absurd."
4,Junk reviews by the Simple Minded,"Some people find satisfaction in writing ludicrous reviews, for whatever reason. Books about ""godless liberals"" and card games are ok, all the rest is plain rubbish. It's a bit sad to be craving for attention like this. Maybe it's not the book that's stupid..."
2,"Theory is decent, but personal interjections unneccesary","Diamond's book does a fairly good job at evaluating the conditions of societal collapse, but his theory lacks the modern analysis of imperialism, which is an enormous factor in collapse today as resources are brought out of the third world into the first for consumer purchase.Diamond's personal interjections break the flow of the book, and often are quite offensive, ""The U.S. explicitly forbids the importation of kangaroo meat, because we find the beasts cute, and because a congressman's wife heard that kangaroos are endangered."" Diamond's personal commentary has no factual basis to support it, and is quite offensive.Collapse approaches potential solutions but instead favors a small, insignificant substitutions for ""unsustainable factors in society."""
4,Dense but Worthwhile,"I really enjoyed this book. It's my second Jared Diamond book (after Guns, Germs, and Steel) so I knewthat the book would be dense and slow-reading. However, like the previous book, I found the vast amountof information fascinating and the ""moral"" of the different tales that he tells to be one well worthpaying attention to today. Diamond is not a great writer but a great synthesizer of information."
1,Not well written,"This book presents a lot of information, but no discernible thème. The author doesn't tie the information together with an opinion of why something is good or bad. For example, Montana is poorly suited for agriculture; the rivers are fouled with fertilizer runoff & salinization caused by agriculture; outsiders have bought up farmland and converted to estates. Does the author propose that the last item is a good thing or a bad thing? Why? He also relates the transition, in a later chapter, of primitive island society changing from inherited hierarchical leadership to leadership by victorious warlords. What's the point? I have no notion that one is more desirable than the other, and the author gives me no understanding of why this transition is significant."
3,Don't Cut Down the Trees,"Note, this is well-written, but by the third or fourth example, you'll have figured out the theme-- which is largely: ""Don't cut down all your trees!"" Basically, the whole gist of the book is centered around cultures that depleted their natural resources, and, as a result, disappeared from the face of the earth.Not as interesting a premise as Guns, Germs, and Steel, and much more pedantic. Jared Diamond is still a solid writer, but this book is too long by 50%, and the premise is too simple for the elaboration within. If you loved books like this, and you're an avid fan of the ""man is bad/environment is good"" genre, you'll probably still enjoy this."
5,Excelent book,"I found this book at my friend's house in Chicago, while I was visiting a few weeks back. This is definitely one of the best and most relevant books I have ever read. Great writing style, I could not stop reading until I finished."
4,Mostly on the mark,"Diamond hits pretty much on the mark all the way across the board. Weakness: for the most part ignores or minimizes the effect of marketing/advertising/propaganda on human consumption patterns. Strengths: one of the few books on this broad subject that actually deals with over-population; indeed, had he concentrated more on this one most important issue, I would have given ""Collapse"" 5 stars.I would strongly recommend this book for anyone concerned with the future of the human race."
5,Collapse,"A fascinating and scary collection of stories about rise and fall of civilizations. Although it might have used a little more editing, it keeps one's attention riveted. It should be required reading for President Bush as well as other world leaders and candidates for leadership roles."
4,"Broad, fascinating and inspiring read.","Collapse is too vast to review. The topics covered, the ideas presented and the facts Diamond lays bare are so vast and overwhelming that not only did the book take me a long time to read, it took me completely by surprise.Definitely recommended reading if you're interested in sustainability, anthropology, history or futurism. It's got it all, and it's scientific as hell.His Pulitzer prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, next."
3,I have this hammer....,"Collapse was certainly informative, well written and interesting. I found the chapters on the Anasazi, Tokogawa Japan and Australia particularly impressive. But. Like many writers, Dr Diamond sees a lot a nails just begging to be smacked by the hammer he's found. In this case, environmental degradation is doom, there's no other doom and the only way to evade the doom (for us) is government edict. Dr Diamond holds up Tokogawa Japan as a success story where goverment controls the useage of key resources and requires the cultivation of replacements (in this case of forests). He ignores the huge example of the power of markets in combination with government to accomplish the same ends, right here at home in the USA."
5,incredible book,"Guns, Germs, and Steel was a great book, but I really found a few of his arguements, especially with respect to why China stopped her age of exploration, to be grasping at straws. In this book, however, he is right on the money. Assuming his data is correct, which I have no reason to assume it is not, his conclusions are impeccable. This is a very important book, and an exiting read."
4,"Good, requires thinking","This book is well-done and well-developed but requires thinking, which many people simply do not want to do anymore. A bit of a downer here and there, but good for some great discussion."
2,Not what you want to see in science,"This book was a required read for one of my college courses, and it proved to have some interesting ideas. Diamond hasn't thought his own ideas out, and has proved to be one author that is weakening the science field as he picks out only the science that ""proves"" his hypothesis, not a review of all the ideas that exists. He attempts to play the role of an anthropologist when he is an environmental scientist. He contradicts himself with his previous books, clearly a sign he is trying for sales, not complete information for the audience. I suggest readingQuestioning Collapse: Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire, as it shows clearly how Diamond could be wrong. I am not saying Questioning Collapse is completely correct either, but it gives a more rounded idea of the story."
4,"a hopefully shorter review, of a good book","First, Amazon should start limiting the size of personal book reviews. Some of these reviews are books in themselves. Sheesh! Keep it brief people, or write your own book. That said, my comments on Collapse:Having just ready Kunstler's ""The Long Emergency"" (very dire and provacative, loved it), and Heinberg's ""Powerdown"" (also dire, but in a velvet-hammer sort of way, with different angles covered), I think that ""Collapse"" is extremely thorough but in Diamond's ""professorly"" style (which he is). I don't think he puts nearly enough alarm, given all the to-the-T statistics and histories, about the true dimensions of the impending energy and food crises. But then the average SUV driving, fast-food gorging, Desperate-Houswives-watching mindlessly consuming suburbanite probably wouldn't find time to read Collapse anyway. And they will suffer the consequences. Heinberg's book is the best balance of alarm and level-headedness in my view. A must read."
3,dissapointing - with some interesting bits,"The book deals with some fundemental environmental problemms of past and present societies. The title however is misleading because most of the book is dealing simply with environmental problems of cultures that did not collapse, and it is not well connected to the first part, where collapsing societies are discussed. While the chapters on Easter island, the Anasazzi and Greenland are convincing and well researched and written, the others, especially the Maya, are surprisingly lacking in detail and rigour.The second part reads like a shopping list of environmental problems and as such, even though it is accurate and important, is boring and irrelevant to the questions of collapse.All in all one of Diamond's weaker efforts"
2,Don't get the audio book,I couldn't stand the narrator's voice. The first chapter was a yawner about Montana farms or something...I tried several times to listen to this book but kept shutting it off. I'll give the book the benefit of doubt and two stars instead of one.
2,"Great Topic, Surprising Bad Treatment","I loved Diamond's Guns, Germs & Steel, and had similar high hopes for this. Unfortunately, I found it disjointed, anectodal, and very disappointing. Although Diamond is obviously a good man and probably not guilty of this, I got the impression the Montana information was included so he could write off his vacations there. There is valuable information in here, so if you're interested in the topic it's worthwhile, but this has all the hallmarks of a quickie follow up to a commercial success (Guns, Germs and Steel) you expect from a new movie star but not a Pulitzer-prizewinning author. You're better than this, Jared."
2,Skip the second half,"The first half of the book has some interesting historical and archaeological information about Easter Island, Greenland, the Maya, and the pre-columbian American Southwest. If the author had stopped there I would have given it 4 stars. The second half is the author's diatribe about all the terrible things modern societies are doing to the planet yadda yadda yadda. You've heard it all before. His buggabear is deforestation. Legitimate, perhaps, but if I want to read opinion pieces I disagree with, I'll read the NY Times. Still, the first half - except the first chapter on Montana - is a good read."
2,A Swing and a Miss,"Guns, Germs and Steel was a tough act to follow, and Diamond doesn't deliver with Collapse. Generally readable and contains some interesting bits, but vastly verbose and about twice as long as it needs to be. Although he starts out with a balanced, objective approach, by the end he is ensuring invitations to all the cool cocktail parties in Los Angeles by spewing unsustained statistics on global warming with no acknowledgement of any competing views."
1,No Excuse,"This is a superb book, but there is no excuse for the Kindle version to cost more than the paperback edition."
1,biased,thought it would give me an overview of societies with issues and why they collapsed. Not so much. As it ended it sounded like Al Gore had helped write it.
1,More bargain-basement reductionism and idiocy from Diamond,"Yet more out-of-date Malthusianism from Diamond. Although he has no qualifications or training whatsoever in the fields of anthropology, sociology, or archaeology, none of this prevents him from making bald assertions that would never hold up under any sort of professional inquiry. Instead, Diamond is willing to assert claims that biologists let go of in the 1950s, in order to re/create his model of biological and ecological determinism. Utter rubbish."
3,Interesting dissertation,"This is interesting and very well documented, but very dry reading. I felt that much of the book was discussions of societies that are very small and isolated. This makes them easy to study, but I have to wonder if they really give good insight into the workings of a society as a whole. Also, I have to wonder if the historical knowledge of these societies is really deep enough to support what Dr. Diamond is pulling from them."
5,Highly Recommended!,This is a well written and interiguing story of the factors which led to the collapse of several historical civilizations and societies and the environmenatl factors which contributed to their declines. These societies are compared with Montana USA and the environmental forces undermining modern day Montana. A joy to read and not the usual depressing story of environmental decay.
3,Bold but incomplete,"Diamond's ""Collapse"" is one of the more interesting non-fiction reads of this year, but it fails to address its thesis adequately.Diamond posits a set of criteria to explain how civilizations have collapsed, and how this might be used to prevent such occurrences in the future. However, he glosses over so many of his examples that they lose their validity.Some chapters could have been much longer, while others could have been mere mentions in more important chapters. I don't understand why he would bother to study some civilizations, yet leave them so little space in his book.Another problem is the lack of background information on the civilizations. While there are the standard historical facts, there are rarely any detailed examinations of most of the civilization's histories beyond their impact on the environment and eating habits.An interesting book, but not definitive."
3,Great for falling asleep to,"This book is.. boring. Real boring. It's like reading over-and-over 50 page chapters that all have the same punch line conclusion. I'll give Diamond credit for being ridiculously knowledgeable about his subject areas, anthropology, biology, geography, etc. He's so knowledgeable he can go on for 30 pages about Caribou poop in Greenland."
2,Too much...,"This book starts off on a very biased footing, with an micro study of the author's favorite ranch, why he liked it, and what it represents (who cares!). He goes to the riduculous exercise of comparing it to other major world sites. If you survive this initial drag, you will be bored by very specific details about certain civilizations, only to arrive to the same conclusion...the weather did it!"
3,Collapse by Jared Diamond,Only 10 % complete at this time. It is starting to hold my interest. This is a book club selection.
5,thanks jared...,"personally,and in all honesty,jared's ""collapse"" was one of the most informative books i have ever read;and i admit it,i,indeed,become afraid of the fate of mankind's destiny and this planet after reading this book of his.people,know how to manage and make the most of your resources,jared's message to us is very touching and important..."
2,Somewhat Hurried and Uneven,"This is a very authoritative look at mankind's impact on the environment. Some parts are more informative than others. The parts that are well-written and well-structured are as good as anything available in non-fiction works. The parts that are less well-written and ""hurried"" are pretty unmemorable."
2,Excessively Repetitive,"This book could have been written in about . . . 100 pages. The author hammers on the same points continuously without offering any fresh takes due to the different circumstances he describes in the book. Other than the history portions of the book which I found entertaining, I was thoroughly bored the entire way through.Also . . . Montana??"
2,Collapse by Jared Diamond,the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set.
5,A must read for the well informed,"This well written dense book is surprisingly readable due a conversational style. The intensity of the subject matter creeps up on you leading this reader to a more pessimistic conclusion than the author. Having been written before the near economic collapse and the endless political stalemate, the intention seems to suggest that hope is out there. About 6 years post-publication, it is unclear if Diamond would still see a positive outlook ahead. It is a thought provoking well researched book that holds relevance despite the changes that have transpired over the years."
4,Boston Editor review of Collapse,Fascinating perspectives offered on the drops in the pond that have led to societal tidal waves in human cultures throughout history.--visit me online at www.editingboston.com
1,Where are these pictures,"I bought the Kindle version of the book, but not any picture or photo in the book. Its Kindle version is an incomplete book since it refers many of these pictures."
3,More Pages than Content,"This book has more pages than content. I found parts of it interesting, but they eventually became repetitious, tiresome, and preachy. The author feels that mankind tends to excess, is shortsighted, and has a poor concept of the future (except for himself, of course). This is hardly news to anyone over the age of thirty. If the author were truly concerned about deforestation, he would have made his point in half as many pages."
2,Decent but not outstanding,"There was obviously someone awake in the sales department when coming up with the title of this book but it really was not as scintillating as I had hoped. Collapse starts out kind of slow, with some rambling on about Diamond's experiences in Montana, before it gets interesting. The middle section is decent, concerning societies that have collapsed and the various reasons why and then the end gets kind of preachy, about what we can do to save-the-spotted-owl and that sort of thing. For those who have read ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"", Diamond's exhausive (and exhausting) statistic-laden writing style will be familiar but, if you have not read his earlier work, don't pick up ""Collapse"" expecting a white-knuckle thriller. It is really more of an academic tome than popular reader. In all, I think many people will be duped into expecting more excitement from ""Collapse"" than it delivers."
2,Dull,"This book was assigned to me for a course in Sustainability, it brings you through thousands and thousands of years of collapsed societies based on five main points. It was the same story over and over about a different society. The whole book was very dull and despressing. Very few interesting facts, wasn't written too long about but feels out dated."
5,An Education in Ecology,This is by far the best book I have read on what makes societies disappear from the face of the earth while others continue. A must read for anyone concerned with overpopulation and conservation of natural resources.
1,Tedious,"I was very dissapointed in this book. Though the concept is intriguing, the writing style is tedious and repetitive. It is said that Social scientists in an effort to ensure their scholarship is recognised, often obfuscate their material to try to make the point. This book is a fine example of that phenomena.Still a good editor could have probably saved this book. Alas that was not the case. Good book to put you to sleep though."
1,Kindle version more expensive than paperback.,"The Kindle Edition of this book is more expensive than the paperback edition sold new. This is not Amazon's fault, it is the publisher's fault. This is not acceptable. A digital edition of a book costs essentially nothing to produce and nothing to distribute. There is no inventory to manage and no risk of being burned with returned stock. When publishers choose not to deliver a digital version of their books at acceptable prices, it puts eReader users in an unfortunate position. I will read this book by taking it out at a library for free. If the publisher had priced the digital edition below the physical edition, I would have bought it."
1,bad sequel,"Guns, Germs and Steel, though somewhat ethnocentric, was a decent book with good points. this one remains ethnocentric, but loses the good points.."
4,Diamond always informative and interesting but always repetitive,"I really like reading Diamond's books because they offer so much information about so many different fields. For example I knew nothing about China's industrial waste, or mining, or Australia's indigenous destruction until I read this book. He conveys so much enthusiasm for what he writes about. That said you could read every other page and maybe not get every detail but certainly get the gist that he continuosly hammers into the reader's skull. Diamond has a bad habit of at once assuming you are someone interested in chemistry, psychology, anthropology or anything else he could throw at you and at the same time assuming you have very little if any short term memory. All in all a good read even if a little senstationalistic and redundant."
3,I had higher hopes for the book.,"I had higher hopes for this book after reading Guns, Germs and Steel. But it was more difficult for me to really get into the book. His basic assumption is any society that extracts natural resources faster than a sustainable rate will vanish unless they comes to grips with the problem and modify their behaviour so they become sustainable. I would have thought he would have touched on other issues but the environment is the single focus of the book. While there is a lot of truth to what he says I thought the book would discuss other reasons that societies collapse as the environment is not the only reason an economy or society will collapse."
2,Surprised at how bad this was,"Jared Diamond can type a lot of words, but he says very little. Much of the info is repetitive and rote as you can skim through all the historical chapters without missing anything. As others have noted, Diamond's failing is that he makes broad assumptions without evidence early on and it corrodes his credibility from the start. Overall, a terrible book I recommend you skip. Read the summary and you'll know enough to save your money."
4,"Very good reading, unfortunately lengthy at times","the width and depth of Prof. Diamond's knowledge is truely amazing! At the same time, this book is a refreshing disgression from the usual (at least in Germany, my home) ""tree huggers'"" attitude of sorting all people into ""good"" ones (who support their agenda), and ""bad"" ones (who do not). Instead, he argues, that incentives guide people's behaviour, and if they are set wrong -and this can happen without any bad intentions!- the results may be desastrous.The only problem, I have with this superb book, as compared to, say, Guns, Germs and Steel by the same author is that it is too long winded at times. 100 pages less, and it would have been perfect!"
3,Enh,"In this follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning Guns, Germs, and Steel (which I have not read), Jared Diamond attempts to examine and explain why certain ancient societies such as the American Anasazi, Mayans and Easter Island collapsed. He poses the theory that there are essentially five factors in a societial collapse, although not all are always present: 1) environmental, 2) climatic, 3) warfare, isolation, and how the society responds to hardship. Nothing new or earth-shattering, but very interesting to look at in the detail Diamond gives. I thought he was a little high-handed at times and I could have done without his many nostalgic stories about fishing with his grandfather in Montana, but it was interesting all the same. I won't delve into it much more than that because this book has been reviewed to death! It's interesting for any history, sociology or anthropology buff, certainly."
5,Excellent Book,Geography is detiny? It just might be so. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in what it's all about.
2,Dry,The author is an environmentalist and uses his book to get his point of view across.The comparisons are absurd.It took me a LONG time to get throught he book.
3,Here is a very good review,"I have not read the book, but I read Guns, Germs, and found it very enlightening, if not completely convincing. While considering whether to read Collapse I came across this outstanding review of the book by Victor Davis Hanson which refutes many of the basic underpinnings of Diamond's thesis. I would commend the review to you at: http://www.nationalreview.com/books/hanson200505200837.asp"
2,condition not revealed,"I was sorry to find underlining in the book. Underlining should be revealed as part of the condition of the book,"
5,fascinating,everyone should read this book. it isn't as accessible as 'guns germs...' but every bit as good.
4,will our own skyscrapers one day stand derelict and overgrown like the temples at Angkor Wat?,"Groundbreaking writer and thinker Jared Diamond delivers a visionary new book on the mysterious collapse of past civilizations and what this means for our future. He ponders why some societies have thrived and others have not. He wonders what happened to the people who sculptured the forlorn long-abandoned statues of Easter Island or those that created the now crumbling Mayan pyramids. He wonders if our own society will go the same way as those who have collapsed. Diamond brings together evidence from a startling range of sources and piecing together the myriad influences, from climate to culture, that make societies self-destruct. This book shows how we can benefit from our knowledge of the past and learn to be survivors."
3,A Chore To Read,"Compared to his earlier work, I found this book interesting but a real plow to read. It is repetitive and badly written. The section on Greenland held my attention but the business about Montana rings like a bad penny. It's nothing more than a bone thrown to friends.The ideas are good but the presentation really lets the reader down. Whatever is the fuss about? Looks like a classic case of resting on one's laurels."
2,Australian scientists show Diamond got it wrong,"The Australian Institue of Agricultural Science and Technology found chapter 13 ""Mining"" Australia to be deeply flawed. In their AIAST Journal they write ""Diamond's analysis suffers from igonrance of geography and history, confusion between areas and eras, a poor understanding of the concepts of sustainability, and an over readiness to uncritically accept some popular assertions."" (...)"
2,Plates missing from the Kindle edition,"This (excellent) book comes with two sets of images: 1) maps of the places where the different societies mentioned lived (Easter Island, Australia, Greenland, China, etc.) and 2) Sets of plates with 40 or so additional photos. The maps are included in the Kindle edition, although they don't look too god. The screen resolution is too small, so they look very, very blurry and the text in the maps is utterly unreadable. I uploaded a couple of screen grabs so you can judge for yourselves. Can anyone read the names of those tiny little islands? Thank God we have Google Earth. As for the plates mentioned in the text, well, they ain't there at all. That's a sloppy digitalizing job, Penguin."
2,"Sereious disappointment, don't judge by cover or title","I have to say, I'm severely disappointed in this book. Diamond's GGAS is one of the most riveting NF books I've ever read, and has given me excellent fuel for numerous intellectual conversations. So I expected more from this. I don't need to go into its structure, as 166 previous reviews certainly cover that. I'm disappointed that this entire book is basically environmental statistics from history. It reads much less like a discourse on sociohistorical problems (as GGAS did) and much more like the findings of some obscure UN charter committee.I know the negative checks are going to roll in for this one, that's why I'm doing this as a kid's review. I don't need my good average screwed."
5,"Balanced, interesting and insightful: required reading","There is no shortage of scary books that selectively present facts to promote a specific agenda - whether environmentalist, free market or whatever. This book on the other hand is very balanced and presents a thorough analysis of different points of view. That is what really makes it scary - you can't discount the arguments as a partisan polemic.The author has managed to keep a certain pace and tell a story without diluting the analytical aspects. So this work of non-fiction is almost as engaging as a well-written fiction."
4,Environment and the Man,"This is a brilliant book. It is very well laid out. The ideas in the book are so very relevant to our times. The argumentation is very well presented, and very logical indeed. The positions that Jared takes in this book are positions not to be taken lightly. The lessons from the societies that have collapsed are so very relevant to our times.Yet, the one thing that was missing for me, is the effect of the sudden increase of our global population in the last 150 years, on the stresses that the world's environment must face today. The pressure on the world's resources is so dramatically different from the pressures of all the centuries ago. I am sure that with the seeming decrease in western populations, global migrations etc, the ways in which we will regard the problems of today, be different from the world of 200 years ago.All in all, a highly recommended book. It is a book to be read slowly, with care. The lessons are to be absorbed, not forgotten when the book is put down."
4,"Excellent methods, often pedantic","In Collapse, Diamond lays out an excellent framework for discussing what makes societies fail. He surveys multiple sites of collapse (quite global in scale) and determines a short list of factors that predict ""collapse."" While his historical/geographic work is rigorous and leaves little room for rebuttal on substantive counts (specifically addressing allegations that his previous work ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" was environmentally deterministic), his approach to the material gets really repetitive: he sets up his framework in the beginning and then takes us through his five axes of collapse over and over again in the case of each society.This is still a great text, though, and it will help a newcomer get a working understanding of the problems that have plagued small or ancient societies (the Maya, Easter Island) to the issues we are still working through (China's pollution, Australia's demand on their natural resources)."
4,A very interesting read.,"Overall, I have nothing but praise for this book. I do not want to explain my reasons for this as other reviewers have done an an excellent job. Rather, I just want to point out that the last figure in this book showing a one-to-one correlation between nations with environmental troubles and ones faced with political instability is completely absurd. For example, Sudan and Colombia are not even on the map showing the politically unstable countries, and China is not on the one showing countries with serious environmental challenges. I just feel that that figure is so grossly erroneous that it takes away from the books overall message."
4,Interesting and well documented. A GREAT READ!!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I must admit I mostly read fiction, so I cannot compare this book to other writings, but I found the book well-written and easy to understand.The author gives a bunch of examples to illustrate and justify his arguments and tells us dozens of stories to complement his ideas. The book is quite long but I rarely got bored while reading it. There is always an interesting detail to focus on and keep turning pages.The books covers different past and present societies as examples to illustrate various factors influencing a tendency for a society to collapse. Easter Island, Vikings, Rwanda (genocide), Dominican Republic and Haiti and Polynesian Islands are among them.I found the last part of the book a bit less convincing and harder to follow. The author describes his concerns about mines, forests, fishing,... and some parts seem endless.Anyway, most of the book is great and I think everyone should have a look at it."
3,A slog,"I gave this book 3 stars because I found the topic interesting but like others agree that Mr. Diamond is in need of a good editor. He lays out his framework of five factors that lead to collapse: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, decreased support by friendly neighbors, and societal response to its problems. The remainder of the book cites examples of societies that have failed and relates them to the five factors. Unfortunately, a great deal of the text is also descriptions of the methods by which modern historians have reached their conclusions. I found myself quickly skimming over much of the material to get to the ""meat"" (at least for me) of the story of each civilization. What started as an interesting topic became a slog. The meat never really came as all of the societies studied were small and isolated. I was hoping, as were many others, to hear Mr. Diamond's assessment of Rome, China, etc. Instead I got Montana and Easter Island."
2,Opinion masquerading as science,"While parts are interesting, the overiding message comes off poorly substantiated and reads mainly as opinion weakly supported by data. In fact, there are almost no direct references for the purported facts reported which leaves the reader wondering if much of anything in the book can be believed. Unfortunately, when he got on topics where I have direct knowledge, he exagerated secondary drivers and largely glossed more significant factors. This is either due to naivety or perhaps because fact didn't fit the 'script' - or a mixture of both. He tends to seek special cases to justify a general conclusion. As with most subscribers to the doomsday scenario he seems to be picking factoids to support his story but isn't looking at the big picture, probably because the big picture shows his case to be without much merit."
5,Solid Reference,"This book is an immensely useful reference for the treatment of a diverse range of materials and objects. It has sections on adhesives and coatings as well. A solid reference for the objects conservator; I keep coming back to it again and again. A bit pricey, but worth it."
3,Doesn't Last Long,"These products taste okay and they smell nice, but they don't plump your lips or stay on longer than 5-10 minutes."
2,Pretty Good Introduction for absolute beginners,"This is a pretty good book for beginning users who have no experience with other graphics programs or little familiarity with Windows & Office either.It is well written and easy to read with plenty of screen shots and step-by-step instruction for a beginning level user. Covers a lot of basic functionality that most Windows or Office users should be familiar with already.Most of the information covered is obvious if you just sit down and play with the program for a few days, but there were one or two little tidbits that were nice to read. The format is very easy to follow and will help get you up and running with the program quickly"
1,A complete disappointment!!,"We bought this jar (2008)thinking that it would be a highlight in our kitchen for Halloween and maybe beyond to Christmas. The quality is very poor. The paint started chipping off within days and the pumpkin on top is badly shaped (and not in a Nightmare way). On the side, the design does not show up and the illustrations are in faded pink and purple colors. Even the candy canes. This is one of the worst Nightmare items in my collection and I can't wait to get rid of it."
5,"Beyond Planning, Organizing, Leading and Controlling, too.","Most management texts do an adequate job of describing the latest innovations, but with rare exceptions they do so in a framework first suggested in 1916 by Henri Fayol. Very few managers nowadays allocate specific effort to planning, organizing, leading and controlling, but that's the way most management texts are still divided up.This book is a refreshing exception. The authors organize their ideas around three managerial roles:Assuring continuous improvementOrganizing to improve cross-functional systemsEnhancing customer value.There are sections on employee involvement and organizational learning, with lots of examples throughout citing firms such as Saturn, Xerox and Federal Express. The style is skeptical and readable.One shortcoming: Having a high-quality hiring process is your most important success factor. For that, ignore the advice in this book and look at Lou Adler's ""Hire with Your Head.""In all other respects, it's a great book."
1,Too much paper for incomplete concepts,The book is well written but many crucial concepts are weakly communicated.
2,"Interesting, but Halting","An interesting book, I found myself reading and rereading entire passages. Not only because I enjoyed the text, but also because the translation was sometimes so awkward that I had trouble making sense of some sections. Perhaps the next edition will be better produced."
2,boring and gross,"this book reads like a crummy clive barker rip off with way too much sexual violence for the casual reader. it also loses most of its energy in the last 50 or so pages, and leaves the reader with just itching for it to end. i ws glad when i got through it, but i definitely wouldnt recommend it to anyone."
4,An excellent reference book,"Although the code samples are not the best, it is still a complete and thorough resource. I prefer to write my own code, including all DirectX calls, and this book has shown me what steps have to be taken to initialize them. As I said, the sample code IN THE BOOK is poor (the explanations of each object are great), but the sample code provided on the CD is very good. These samples are straight from the source--Microsoft programmers themselves. The old samples were archaic and impossible to comprehend at best. These samples are clear and concise and have allowed me to write my own DirectDraw object to manage everything. It is written with enough character to be interesting, yet still express its point. I highly reccomend it for anybody that wants to program multimedia apps/games. Some of the DirectDraw commands are also useful in other apps."
3,"Ok, but...","This book doesn't deserve high ratings. There are NO complete samples -- just code excerpts -- and the ones on CD are confusing. There is 1 sample for every subject, so if you don't understand that, you just don't learn. For example, the joystick sample uses complex dialogs to set attributes, making it impossible to understand. Maybe it's a good reference for _beginners_, or introduction to the concepts, but definately not a learning book. It is hard to quickly find things. Throughout chapters, concepts are unorganized and not step by step -- basically, all incomplete explainations and no solid code. This is obviously thrown together. Try Andre Lamonthe's books.PS: Remember, #define INITGUI at the top of code or Sys_ device constants will be unresolved -- the book does not mention this."
2,A lot of phaff and only directX 5.2,"First and foremost this book was written when directX 5 was the standard. Now we are up to 7/8 and I assume there have been many changes, at least there are some examples in the DirectX 7 SDK which use functions not covered in this book. The lack of complete code examples or exercies means this is definately not a tutorial and there are no tables to indicate it is a reference book. In fact, the book seems to be a collection of ramblings about directX and computer graphics in general. Maybe this was never intended to be a reference or a tutorial, but either would have probably been more useful."
1,No MFC? Hardly Any C++? C is in the stone age.,"I was expecting more from Microsoft Press. The authors are C programmers who don't realize the power of C++ and it's reusabilty. I find no reference anywhere to MFC! The authors are still stuck in the stone age of C programming and I'm assuming they have never heard of MFC even though they work at Microsoft. I wish I hadn't bought this book. I am anxious for the book DirectX Complete With CDROM by James Boer and Michael Root. It won't be available till November 98. From the synopsis it will use the AppWizard in VC++ and use MFC and C++ the way any true Windows program should, for reusabilty and maintenace."
2,Pretty Bad,"Sorry to say but this book is pretty bad, the fragmented code while saves space is not very comprehensible. I was looking for a style like Charles Petzold's book but was disappointed, the sample code on the cd makes up a bit but I have a specific problem with the code on the cd. Some samples actually crashed my machine(Blitz) and Surface did nothing, then I looked at the code while the authors had code to see whether the user had a 16-bit RGB enabled gfx card, they messed that up by setting the mode to 32-bits with the call to SetDisplayMode, so if you have a gfx card that only supports 24-bits the program either does nothing or crashes, why the authors assumed that everyone had a 32-bit gfx card I have no idea to make the programs work change the argument of SetDisplayMode from 32 to 24 and it should work. After reading this book I should email Charles Petzold and beg him to write a book on DirectX."
3,Really good reference but not tutorial,I wanted to learn directx with a tutorial but this book really doesnt cover a tutorial all its writing like a reference of directx!.Good book if you are a directx programer and want a reference!. Also doesnt cover any of Direct3d.
3,A good introduction to directx excluding direct3d,"Like another reviewer pointed out this book is mainly about concepts. I found it a very good starting point to directx programming. However it does not cover direct3d and the depth of coverage, I feel, is less than the other ""INSIDE"" books like inside com or inside ole. While a good introduction to DirectX overall I guess I expected a little more from an ""INSIDE"" book ..."
4,"Good book, but...","I use this book primarily as a reference to directX, but I believe it would serve as a good ""tutorial"". However, DirectX is a low-level windows API, and does not mix good with C++. By using C++, you are adding extra overhead to your program, defeating the purpose of DirectX. C is the best language to use for fast, low-level win32 application programming. I personally think that if you need to use MFC to program windows applications, you should move on to a more whimpier language such as visual basic. However, if you know how to program Win32 applications in C, this book is for you. All examples compiled nicely under my VC4 compiler, with a few modifications to some. Astonishingly, even though this book was written by some guy at microsuck, I really think this is a great book. I really suggest you get it!"
4,Good Historical View of Antipas,"A good book that breaks down the life and politics behind one of leaders who had a hand in Jesus' death. I liked the way that this book was written. It was very easy to read, although about 1/2 of each page was dedicated to footnotes. The author does a good job of using critical analysis when agreeing with historical documentation and when he varies from it."
3,Collection Addition,"This work was cited by other scholarly sources. Its emphasis on politics and the bargain Amazon price inspired me to add it to my collection. It features an extensive bibliography, which is always a plus to subject area collectors."
5,Inspiring,"This book has blessed me. It is easy to read, yet has profound insights about the love and mercy of God."
5,Parables Explained!,This book explains the various levels of Christ's parables. It is just an excellent book on what we can learn from Christ's words (He is The Word!). This provides a deeper understanding about how to live a loving life (following Jesus) rather than a selfish one (following Satan). I highly recumbent it!
5,Awesome!,"Great coat rack for modern rooms! It's a little over 6 feet tall, perfect size. Assembly is a breeze; parts are high quality and screw together perfectly. The tops of the bows also serve as hangers for hats and whatnot. I've owned this for about a year, and the finish has yet to scratch. Worth this difference in $$ if you want a nice one."
4,It's a coatrack... not much more to say,Took my husband five minutes to put together. Exactly what it looks like online. Came really quickly- like the day after the Amazon confirmation.
1,Bubbling Flaky Paint in less than a Year,"Really love the simple design of this, but last month I noticed that the finish is bubbling up and cracking and peeling and flaking off. If I touch it at all it just keeps spreading. This is happening on all the pieces along both edges. SOOOO disappointing."
5,I love the Bar Cynsters!,"I read this book first and immediately looked for ""A Rake's Vow."" Both books did not disappoint me, but I liked Devil and Honoria the best. The story was entertaining, and yes..very sensual and loving. I hope this family's stories will go on and on, and also include the female Cynsters. Fun reading!"
2,good story,"I dont think this is a spoiler alert. If it is im sorry. I have been reading this series, Im like 7 or 8 books in now. There is a recurring theme in all these books, to the point that Im not even interested in them anymore.boy vows to never marry (or just marry for convienence sake)boy meets girlgirl is indifferent to boyboy and girl have a shared interest/mystery to solveboy decides to marry girlgirl is resistantboy and girl have lots of sex (pages and pages of sex)(i end up flipping ahead, its all the same really)boy and girl finally marry and live happily ever afterAnd so far it always seems that girl runs straight into boy somehow. that seems to be how they all meet."
2,2 1/2 stars,"I'd hoped this book would be the best one in the series. It was utterly boring, due to an unlikeable heroine. She was also too aggressive in bed for a virgin. She was much too proper and annoying. I wanted to like her, but I couldn't love her. And the plot was just blah."
5,Wonderful Read!,As romance novels go this story is NOT deep. You do not have to concentrate to keep up with the story. A fast read but pleasantly relaxing.
5,A must read-- over and over again,"Devil's Bride is what a romance novel should be. Strong hero and heroine, good mystery all tied up in a great love story. Stephanie Laurens is must read and a must keep for me."
2,So Glad I Didn't Buy It,"This is the second Stephanie Laurens book I've read and it will definitely be my last. I borrowed it because it reviewed so highly, but was disgusted at the end of 30 pages. Like several other reviewers I was incredulous that Devil was planning his marriage to a woman he had just met as his dying young cousin lay steps away. Predictable plot, uninteresting characters with stupid names, and many historical inaccuracies. It was a chore to finish."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","I like a well-written, clever romance, but this one is full of cliches, cardboard characters, and purple prose so silly I hated to be seen reading it. And the plot--yikes! How predictable and same-old can anyone get? Having read Rogue's Proposal, which I also found dreadful, I thought I'd give this one a try, since it's ""said"" to be the best of the bunch. Sorry, but it was essentially the same story with different names. Why this author has suddenly become so popular, I'll never understand. Do yourself a favor, and miss this bandwagon."
2,Bored all the way through,"Yes, like many people I have a compulsion: I must finish books I start. I also love families in historical romances. This was a huge family of hunky men, so I thought I had to give it a chance. Big mistake. The writing is not as good as many other writers and there are tons of love scenes and little other substance to the book. I was just not entertained, but I still read 4 more of her books hoping that she just wrote a few bad ones at the start. Well, guess what they all stink. The characters are dull, the plot boring and the writing makes it all the more painfull. Save yourself some time and don't read this book."
1,TOO WORDY,WARNING! This book suffers from being overly descriptive. This author apparantly just bought a new thesaurus and thought she should use every word in it. It is about a good a book as you would expect from an author who names her hero something so incredibly stupid as DEVIL.
2,Disappointing!,"I don't like this book at all. A pity as it is well-written, with vivid turn of phrases Miss Laurens obviously applied painstakingly and lovingly. I like honoria, she is strong, independent and intelligent. I just don't like the hero Devil.Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met! He is infuriatingly mulish, not telling Honoria anything, making decisions for her, and making me exasperated in the process. I envision a lifetime of saucepan for them both - Honoria will need a lot of them to beat some sense into this dolt."
5,Not one to miss,"My first book by Stephanie Laurens, quite a suprise. A delightful orginal story. Devil and Honoria were great together and the other charaters added to the books attractions. Being a fan of Lindsey, Deveraux and Kane I have found it hard to find authors that match them. But this book made my list to keep and reread. Not many do that, not even the rest of her Cynster Series. I will differently read more of her books."
3,"Good, but not as exciting as expected","This was my first Laurens book and since it was compared to Julie Garwood and Amanda Quick (I love them both), I had great expectations! The decision for Devil to marry Honoria seemed a little premature, but hay, it is a romance novel. I always love a good strong female in these novels. It seemed to take a long time for them to figure out who did it even when there were lots of hints about. I thought the couple was not terribily cleaver when they were trying to solve the mystery. The love scence between the two tend to be a little long-winded for my preference... I enjoyed reading it, but am not sure if I would run out and buy another novel ASAP."
5,Devil's Bride,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Stephanie Laurens work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
3,Excellent writing.,"Though I found the heroine a bit cold and the hero a little too unreal, at least they both showed some appearance of emotional depth (if a bit overwrought). Sadly, one of the best ROMANCES (and it really IS! not suspense nor gothic nor horror!) I have read in YEARS."
4,Very Good Historical,"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was well conceived and the characters were interesting. There was a cast of family characters that added rather than take away from the story. I also liked the way that after marriage, problems didn't disappear, nor did the hero and heroine become different. They continued to be who they really are but began the necessary compromise of good relationships."
4,Devil's Bride,"While the Cynster series isn't as deep as War & Peace, it is a romantic series that will mostly keep your attention. Devil Cynster meets his match in Honoria. She's met hers.For a mystery that'll trip you up, try Agatha Christie. Sor sex scenes, try Cheryl Holt.For a read that's light, but will keep your attention, read Laurens."
3,"good story, bad covering","This story, for me, was the first of the Cynster series or even Stephanie Laurens books I've ever read, and was quite interesting. The story, with a touch of mystery, was even exciting sometimes, although I could have pointed out who was the murderor almost from the start.... not quite enough mystery for A. Christy maniacs like me, but that is beside the point. The biggest problem with this book is definetely the cover. It is embarassing, and I would rather not hold this book while I am on subway. Could someone think of a better covers for historical romances? I hate to say this, but they are usually terrible."
2,What's all the fuss?,"I tried. Seriously and sincerely tried to like this book. I was excited to uncover a new-to-me romance series. I like spunky, non-traditional heroines. I like big, dark, surface-scary heroes. The back of this book sounded like it was tailor made--just for me! Alas, I struggled through all 388 pages looking, in vain, for a story. For a snippet that would make me smile or send my pulses pounding. To be fair, there were parts of chapters--heck, toward the end there was a solid 30 pages or so--that were riveting and fun and moved the story forward.But, ultimately, this one goes to the next Friends of the Library book sale and this author goes off my ""must have"" list."
2,Best in the series?,"This series was recommended to me, so I decided to start with the first one. At least I think this is the first one in the series. Anyway, it was one that got very high reviews, so I thought it couldn't be too bad. It was pretty boring. Stephanie Laurens seems to write well, yet her characters seem to hold themselves slightly apart from the reader - I just don't seem to connect with them totally and therefore don't feel strongly about them getting together or not. This has been a consistent problem with all the books that I have read by her, so I think I probably won't read any more of them. If you enjoyed this story, great. If you would like to read this story, great - I have a book to sell."
2,Devils bride,"The first 5 chapters were good, there is an exciting story and an attraction happening. Then it fizzles out. Disappointed. Put it down after they went to London."
5,medical marijana done right,"For those who need medical marijuana and need to grow their own this is the bible. You cann't go wrong by reading this book, from seedling to full grown plant of healing. I highly recommend this book."
4,excellent resource,"Easy to read, Simple to navigate, Hands down the best growing resource! If your looking for one book to buy to teach you what you need to know about growing, This is the book for you!"
2,No no no,"I've an extensive career in horticulture. Don't waste your money on this book. It is simple enough for a fourth grader to read butleaves many unanswered questions. Written poorly, by a man who does not write and does not understand the science of botanyand horticulture. After reading you will actually know less than when you began. Ending up in forums where each man has his own opinion and makes up his own facts. I bought this by mistake but read it anyway. Then I went back and boughtEd Rosenthal's book. OMFG what a difference. Now that is a good book to have."
5,Just What I Was Looking for!,"This is a MUST have for new or experienced growers,, it explains things so simply, with answers to problems. I loved all the pictures to show exactly what things should look like. GET THIS BOOK NOW!"
3,Theres better books,Lots of fancy pictures not enough good solid info. Try Ed Rosenthal's High Yield Guide for better indoor growing info.
2,Okay,"The book is good to be used as a reference book but not a guide book on how to grow step by step; is very vague in its explanations. The only props this book has is that it contains beautiful pictures and some tricks and tips but thats all, calling it a growers bible is very misleading!!!"
3,A labor to get through,"I know this book is truly considered the Bible of growing, so I feel like it's herecy to give it a so-so review, but getting through it seems like such a chore. Yes, everything is in there. But it seems like some high tech things are thrown at you like you're supposed to already know what he's talking about, and then something so simple any little kid knows it is explained in exasperating detail. He fires away ideas in random order in one paragraph so the writing lacks a smooth flow of idea and I just can't follow it. While I do think it is worth having, it is a lot easier for me to learn the basics from websites and just keep the book around to use as a quick reference."
3,A good addition to a grower's library,"The information in this book is thorough. Lots of stuff to learn for beginners and experienced growers alike. The only criticism I have is the garish design of the book itself. It also could have been several pages lighter if he removed all of the adverts! Advertising does not have a place in a book like this. If you want to make an Appendix at the end with resources and links then fine, but don't make me wade through several pages of ads for seed companies, fertilizers, and grow mediums.I actually prefer the Greg Green book better, although the information is not as comprehensive as the Cervantes book.The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical UseI find the two together complement each other quite well...so get both!"
5,Simply Amazing!!,If you can look past the misspellings this is a very good book to read if you are a medical patient. This will also help people looking into becoming caretakers so they can grow the highest quality medication as possible. Don't pass this up or any of Jorges DVD's.
4,Marijuana Horticulture for medical marijuana,"This Book was very informative, and helped me get up and running without having to learn from my own mistakes.Great Photos and diagnostics for pests, and nutrient information."
4,Good Book,Received book very quick. Book was everything I had expected from the ad on Amazon.com. Very informative from seed to enjoyment. Pictures and charts help with proper use of all equipment you might need to accomplish what your after.
4,Really liked this book,"I really liked this book. Very informative on many levels;however,it could have included more information for the backyard outdoor grower."
2,"Full of ads, some of them as irrelevant is the content","This is a book full of advertisements, disorganized information, and very little sciencea much better alternative is Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Grower's Handbook"
5,great,"my husband cannot live w/out this book, with his medicinal needs. he thinks it is awesome and at a great price!"
5,The Best Choice,Its the best choice.I dont usually read books on my free time but i find this one to be very free flowing; both easy to read and comprehensive.In addition to the horticultural information you'd expect it has some insightful tips on keeping you and your garden both safe and discreat. I appreciate that. Thanks Jorge. Keep it green.
5,best book eva,"its like a weed dictionary that has everything you could possibly need to know theres a whole chapter on oils and butters same on indoor/ outdoor, harvesting, all different kinds of bugs you might have to deal with and how to get rid of them. theres also choke pictures which makes the read easy."
5,BEST BOOK BY FAR,have 8 other grow books. none compare to the step by step picture by picture discriptions. i now know everything to do with cannabis growing harvest cureing and hash making. dont waste time and money on any other book. trust me. i havent been paid or asked to write any of this. wish i had bought this before the others. its better than Ed's bible. a must buy thank you Jorge!!!!
3,Average,"Quite a bit of information, but it's very scattered and redundant in some cases. If this were more polished it would be a great book."
3,dissapointed,"This book had so much information on seeds, nutrients, different lighting, grow rooms. But there was no step by step instruction on actually going about growing. For someone who is interested in private growing and has not grown before, this book was completely useless. If your an expirieneced grower, than this book has lots of info to help improve your growing."
5,growers bible,"Best carry along pictorial for cultivators and those learning to grow medicine to treat their ailments. Color coded pages make locating topics easy,The organization of content is perfect."
5,Educational to say the least,"Simply a ""Must Read"" for anyone who is serious about growing there own medical cannibus, very thorough and informative!"
4,very good,"like growing for dummies type of thing, gets u started or also implement what u already know, plus lots of good pics :P"
2,NYTimes Crossword Dictionary a Disappointment,"When my A-Z Crossword Dictionary fell apart from overuse, I was anxious to try the NYTimes Dictionary. I wish I had ordered another copy of the A-Z instead. In the A-Z, I was able to find more answers, and the foreign word sections were much better than in the Times. Also, the Times Dictionary lists foreign countries in dark gray boxes which make the text very hard to read. Love the NY Times crosswords, but the Dictionary needs work!"
2,What's a 12-letter word for sorry I bought this?,"Disappointed. I am a devoted NYT Sunday puzzle doer. I have done about 4 weeks worth of puzzles since I aquired the book. Of the 50 or so words/terms/places, etc. I have looked up, I found probably 5. This is NOT the crossword puzzle dictionary I remember from years ago, which was tailored to actual multi-word clues, and did not just provide ""synonyms"" for single word entries."
2,New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"I found this book physically difficult to use. It was a chubby small paged paperback as opposed to earlier editions of the same whose pages were much larger, and the books easier to use. Also, it was not as topical as I had expected...i.e. upgrades of state descriptions adding state mottos...addition of Roman numerals...addition of more common current slang...etc. I was NOT happy with my purchase. I feel the authors could have done a much better job."
2,Crossword Dictionary not as much help,"I am not as happy with this crossword dictionary as the one I already have that is falling apart. It does not have categories such as the greek gods, elements, animals, presidents!, etc. That part of the dictionary I already had was very helpful. I can't seem to find as many words in this one as the one I had. I thought it would be much better especially with it being from the New York Times. I have never complained about anything else I have ordered with you. I have been very happy with everything else purchased.Kathy"
2,How to cheat on crossword puzzles!,I got 2 of these for my husband and son for their crossword madness...and they both thought this was just 'cheating' and refuse to use them! Oh well!
2,New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"The book arrived promptly, packaged very well. Not in as good condition as I expected but my fault for ordering a used book."
5,Great doing buisness with you.,"Item arrived earlier than expected. I bought it for my grandma to help with her crossword puzzles, and was expected nothing for Christmas. She found this under the tree and was very pleased. Thank you!"
4,New York Times Crossword Puzzel Dictionary,"This is a good dictionary except that it hasn't been updated since the 1990's so it's missing a lot. But, it still works."
4,I Expected More,"I purchased this crossword dictionary, and it is OK. There are a lot of words not in this book, some I find in a regular dictionary. It has about 80% of the correct puzzel words. I am a little disappointed."
2,too small,the book was very misleading.It was a way too small.Hated the size of it.I have a old one that is a lot bigger.
4,New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary is worth buying,"I used the original edition for years until it finally fell apart, so this latest edition is a most welcome addition to my library. It is very helpful for any crossword fanatic like myself."
1,crossword puzzle junkies,"I bought this product to assist me with doing the NY Times crossword puzzles. The book is worthless. Not like using a dictionary AT ALL. It is so complicated to use that I no longer try to use it. Please don't purchase on line; If I had seen it in person, I would not have bought."
4,bought as a gift for someone,"I can't even really review this because I gave it away. the person I gave it to uses it, so I guess it'sOK"
2,Non what I expected,That's my fault. Should have looked more carefully at what was included. I prefer the Websters variety of crossword dictionary.
3,No number of letters in results.,You could look up clue answers faster if the words were grouped by the number of letters in each answer.
2,Crossword dictionary,"Purchased this for my dad, but he is unable to use it. The print is way too small and it doesn't contain half of the words that his previous dictionary did (he lost the original one)."
2,Disappointing,"The potential for this to have been truly great is lost by the focus of the film. If you are not familiar with Mr. Carey's remarkable work, this will not supply too much evidence. The acting is fair. The actors who play Mr. Carey and the first Mrs. Carey are just not up to the roles. There is a bit of underacting and overacting here. What a shame that such an important story could not have been told better."
2,Poor quality...poor acting,"The story of William Carey is an inspirational one. Unfortunately, this dramatic portrayal contained in this video doesn't do the story justice."
2,Not Impressed,"While I thought the story itself and the cinematography was good, I was totally unimpresed with the dialog given by Altman to Beatty and Christie. Beatty basically has mumble dialog and Christie business dialog. I never really could get involved with the characters. I also thought Cohen's 1971 sounding music was annoyingly out of place for this early century movie. I think this is the clear failing of the director and wonder how much better this movie could have been had someone other than Altman (Huston, perhaps?) directed & controlled the screenplay/movie."
1,Altman Agonistes,"If you like Altman, you may like this, but Christie is horribly miscast as the female lead and Beatty, as the male lead, might as well have ""mailed in"" his performance. With Altman, it's not so much about the actors as it is Altman.This was agonizing, although possibly not as agonizing as Buffalo Bill and the Indians.As usual, Altman takes two hours to express his cynical view of the world. So tiresome . . . ."
1,Another mess by Robert Altman,"Robert Altman fans are like ""Velvet Underground"" fans: There are only about 500 of them around, they fanatically defend the object of their adulation, they insist that their love is the source of inspiration for everything that came out after them in their respective venues (rock music/film), even when no one else has even heard of them, they find the lack of technique as intentional and laudable, they seem to admire pointlessness. Does anyone really think the man who made ""Popeye"" is a genius? Everyone I know hated this film - and not because of some perceived attack on capitalism (which I think you need to have a wild imagination to see in this film) but because it seems so pointless, boring, downright pretentious. It is a grade Z art film."
1,"A Documentary, not the movie","I bought this DVD thinking I was buying the movie, McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Instead, when I began to play it, I found that it is actually a backdrop for commentary by Robert Altman (the director) and David Foster (the producer). As the movie begins, their commentary on how they made the film begins and there is no way to turn it off. The ""Special Features"" has a selection for ""Commentary"", but selecting it does not provide an option for turning it off; there is no way to turn the commentary off. Don't buy this DVD if you want the movie. This is a DVD of Altman and Foster blabbering about the movie with the movie as a backdrop, it's not the movie. I would give the movie five stars, but if there were a way to give this DVD no stars, I would. Don't buy this if you want the movie! You'll be wasting your money."
1,Worst Western Ever Made,"""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" is the worst western ever made. Warren Beatty and Robert Altman join up to destroy the whole western genre single handedly. This is not what the west was all about. Altman has it all wrong. There is no honor, dignity or glory to be found anywhere in this film. That's what the west was really all about. Sorry."
1,Destruction of the American Western,Robert Altman once again demonstrates his inability to comprehend the essence of his film's subject. The dismal story of this would-be-Western is only matched by the dismal photography by Vilmos Zsigmond. This film helped destroy the iconic myth of the American West. I do not like this movie at all.
3,"Beautifully filmed, but a strange movie","Robert Altman directed this deglamorization of the western myth. Warren Beatty plays a two-bit hotshot who opens a bordello in a mudcaked excuse for a town, importing his girls from San Francisco. It purposely tries for a downplay of Hollywood's glamorous view of the West, and at time its realism is just plain griminess, and slows down the flow of the picture. The ending, a shoot-out of sorts in the snow, is strange, but beautifully photographed. Different, to say the least. Also stars Julie Christie as Constance Miller."
5,A client focus,"An important subject, covered in depth. Mark Dworkin presents his material in a readily accessable manner for the professional.The book is brilliantly edited by Margot Silk Forrest whose work will be remembered from ""EMDR-The Breakthrough Therapy for Overcoming Anxiety, Stress and Trauma"".""EMDR and the Relational Imperative"" is a long awaited volume and belongs on every therapist's shelf."
4,Bonsai starter kit,This is a nice item for the money. It turned my funny looking plant (my wife said) into a Bonsai. The only thing else that would have been nice with it would be some wire to help train the plant.
5,Great lyrics; great beat; great music.,"Rarely do you find an album where the lyrics and the music are so well matched. This album makes you think, but it also rocks. The songs stick with you, and in one of those wonderful phenomenons - they keep growing in interestThis is an album which has a lot of depth. The more you listen to it - the more you hear.I loved it."
4,Cute anime,Pretty cute series. Really cool characters. Not to mention really neat songs. Really funny too. Giving this title four stars is because I did not like the ending to RETURNS.But I did have a fun time watching this. I even got a drama cd after this (even though I don't know that much Japanise).
4,GREAT BUY!,"THIS BOOK IS AN AWESOME FIRST COOKBOOK, REFERRENCE BOOK. IT NOT ONLY HAS RECIPES, BUT NUMEROUS INFO FOR AMETUER, OR COUPLES JUST STARTING OUT. HOW TO'S ARE GREAT. LOOK UP SUBSTITUTES FOR INGREDIANTS, OR HOW TO DEVAIN SHRIMP! ANYTHING!!"
4,cookbook review,The book arrived quickly and was in OK condition. It was the book I was looking for because my copy was falling apart
3,Could I rate it 21/2 stars?,"The book I purchased was listed as new. It came wrapped in seran wrap like I have in my kitchen. There was a small stain which I was not pleased with. The item was a wedding present for my daughter and I was disappointed in the purchase, but my daughter insisted on keeping it. I feel the ""new"" condition was mis-represnted."
5,LOVE MY PISTOULET!!,"These are the perfect dishes -- bright, cheerful, sturdy, whimsical. I love the colors! Much of their charm, to me, stems from the fact that they coordinate, but don't match. I have two sets - one blue and one red. They are so fun and happy looking. I ordered mine from another vendor, but they were packaged well, and arrived in great shape. It's only been a few weeks, but they are holding up well in the dishwasher and the microwave. I have owned Pfaltzgraff before, and these seem to live up to the name. No problems so far. If you want warm, happy dishes, you can't go wrong with Pistoulet."
5,Beautiful and practical dinnerware set,"After owning the Pfaltzgraff Yorktown pattern for over 25 years, I decided to replace them because I just wasn't ever going to wear them out and I wanted a change. After the durability of the Yorktown set, I decided to stay with Pfaltzgraff. I hadn't looked at patterns at years and was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful some of the current patterns are. The Pistoulet is incredibly cheerful. I love everything about them--the colors, the sizes (the 2 bowls are great), the glaze, the weight. I couldn't have designed a pattern that I would have loved more."
4,Nice dishes but.....,"Dishes arrived on time and as promised but had one bowl and one plate broken in shipment. When notified they immediately sent a another complete set. Then we had to send damaged set back. They also sent us a credit of 18.22 for the damaged pieces(after we asked). All we really wanted were the two broken pieces replaced but they would not do it that way. The sets came in 2 seperate boxes each time and were kinda heavy so it was a bit of a hassle shipping them back. Dishes are very nice and colorful but, I feel somewhat over-priced. Ron"
1,Terrible,The dishes are poorly packed. The cardboard separaters were not protecting the dishes. The dishes are very breakable. The dishes were packed on top of the bowls and not separated by cardboard. I think Amazon should sever their relationship with this vendor. The return trouble is not worth it. What a mess!
4,Recent receipt of dinnerware,"I enjoyed the dishes but half of my big bowls, and half of my small plates were shattered in their boxes in transit to me. Amazon sent me replacements, but now are telling me via e-mail that they need the broken pieces, whilst the customer service person on the phone told me not to bother to send the shards back.Amazon is now threatening to charge me for the replacements (which should be free of charge since they were broken in transit to me)."
4,Love Pistoulet,"I love these dishes so much that I purchased service for 8 for our home in FL.It came very quickly but a dessert bowl was damaged, but Amazon made good on it, thats why I continue to shop here.The Pistoulet colors go with every thing and I love the designs that blend with each different pattern in the collection."
3,Missing pieces of dinnerware,I thought the quality of the dinnerware was great but it was missing 2 of the mugs. I ordered service for 8 but got slightly less. I'm a little disappointed considering the amount of money I spent on the items. I expected to get my full money's worth.Jen
2,no quality control,"order got messed up-problem in fulfillment, but they handled it well. Got in white also- arms are the length for a chimpanzee. They need to QC this better. The tomato color is high quality, one of my favorites."
3,Good for complete novice,"This book helped me in that I am completely new to DNA programming and until a month ago, had no idea what MSMQ even did. However, it does not go into enough detail to help a person set up anything beyond a simple system internal to one enterprise. If you are looking for help implementing queuing across enterprises (as I was), you'll have to go elsewhere."
2,100% introductory and nothing beyond,"This book is reasonably good for a complete novice but: 1. All the examples are in VB, no C++. 2. Very introductory. Much more info can be found on MSDN. 3. It focuses more on workflow design than MSMQ per se."
3,A beginner's book,I started MSMQ a month ago and found this book quite useful for novice like me. It starts with concepts and them implement it in the following chapters.Sometimes find it a bit hard to follow as the steps are not given in full.Does not include info to set up the MSMQ environment properly as this is also very much helpful for beginner.Conclusion : 3 stars book. Could be further improved.
3,Great tasting but crumbles,My dog goes crazy for these treats but when I try to cut it to smaller sizes they crumble into powder. It would be great it the company made smaller size treats for small dogs because these are pretty big.

3,Great...While It Works,I loved my Nano when I first got it. After a little over a year--and the warranty ran out--it suffered a catastrophic failure. Now I've got a really expensive paperweight.
3,Nano so-so but return policy was A Plus,We had a problem within the 1st 30 days of purchasing the Nano but were able to return it very simply and had a new one before the old one even got sent back. Great customer service. Nano is now working perfectly 3 months later.
4,So far it is great!,"I am not the best in knowing about electronics technology, but I figured this out pretty easy. I had a different kind of Mp3 player, that was bulky, and hard to read the buttons, the nano is easy to use, and it is so small. The sound is great, hard to believe it comes out of something so small. I am sure once I get use to using the software and downloading more songs, it will become even easier."
3,iPOD nano 4GB,"like that i can carry so many songs, but am disappointed that the battery lasts for only 4-6 hrs before it needs to be charged.And when you charge it, it has to charged thru the USB port on my computer.i thought the iPOD nano would have a longer charge life."
4,Good for the most part,"I love the size. It's perfect for jogging. The down side of these small devices is they're hard to find if you misplace them. I'm still learning all the ins and outs of this device. I took off one star because user-friendliness is not what I expected with Apple's reputation. Guess I'm just lazy and don't like having to go through the help menu. I maxed out on my free space, so I deleted songs to free up space. iTunes wouldn't let me add new songs even though it indicates that I have more than enough free space. I may have to restore and start over again.One BIG word of warning. I installed the 6/23/06 update and my iPod stopped working. I spent hours and hours trying to fix the problem. Apparently others have run into the same problem. If this happens to you, go directly to the discussion forum to find the fix. The general fixes on their website doesn't solve the problem. I don't know why Apple is making buggy software updates available for downloads."
5,truly amazing.,"Can't say enough about this ipod. The size is perfect, my gf's mini feels like a brick compared to this. Sound is great, better than my ipod shuffle. Color screen is nice and great battery life. Yeah it scuffs up easily but no big deal. I covered the screen with a 1"" strip of clear packaging tape to protect from scratches, works great and looks good. Other than that it's pretty durable. I've already dropped it off my desk several times and it's held up nicely."
5,I dont have it but.........,Hay i dont have it i am saveing up for one Win you have a normal CDCan you do something can you put those songs on your ipod???Thanks
4,Very good,"I love everything about this little mp3. Its my first Ipod, so far so good. My only issue is that when I download a live set or DJ Mixed cd from Itunes, when I listen to it in my ipod there are gaps between songs. A little help with this? I'll appreciate it!"
1,BATTERY SUCKS,"So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO, I orderedone from MAC the Monday of release.It arrives, we all OOOOH and AHHHHHI take it home and charge it for the nightWake up at 5:30, fully charged battery, put it onand get on with my day, by 10 AM the battery had DIEDCRAP!I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this oneI say HELL NO! I just BOUGHT it, I am not sending this backfor you to REFURBISH it, I want a new one, and you screwedup my inscription, too.....So I am getting ready to mail this back, when I charge thebattert ONE more time, all night charge, fresh in the AMThis time, it stayed on from 7:30, when I started to use it until1:26PM, an hour ago, my NANO died from poor battery power.Watch out when you get these, I am going to return this and hopeI get a better one, if I get another POOR BATTERY, I am goingto get a freaking refund, this is BOGUSMAC should know better than to release a product that is crap:/"
5,Buy 8 GB,"I loved it! But if I'll buy now I would prefer 8 GB. Believe me 1,000 songs is not so much, as I thought."
4,Great prouduct but you need to take certain precautions,"ok, so i got the ipod nano for christmas and its dec.28 and its great hold lots of songs, good sound quality BUT,its terribly scratched up and I don't want the same to happen to you. Dont let the stories of screens cracking 2minutes after purchases, all you need to do is LEAVE THE PROTECTIVE PLASTIC OVER THE SCREEN!!!!!!!!!! Cut it so you can use the wheel, i know keeping the little plastic thing over the screen is not what you want to do when you open it( i tore pulled mine off first thing out of the box) but just leave it over teh screen until you can get a good case for it and even then be careful, and if you do not heed my advice do not put the ipod in your pocket, even if its only thing in your pocket. bottom line- great mp3 player, but the screen scratches easily so protect it."
2,battery is horrible,i got my ipod for Christmas and i can tell you...everything about the nano lives up to the hype except for its battery life. I understand that results differ from ipod to ipod (by reading others reactions) but i'd say that the battery has truely dissapointed me. I think mine on a full first charge (about half a day) lasted only about 2 hours
5,charge with Playstation 2!!,insted of buying a charger if you have a playstation 2 use the USB 1.1 port to charge. this is useful if you play games aloti dont own a ipod but my friend and i have tryed it and it works*note dose not save ps2 game data on ipod!
5,"Once again, great job apple!","I bought my nano about a week ago and it's great product. You get exactly what the description says you will. The graphics are great, the color is beautiful. The album art feature is really nice. The sound quality is great. The nano comes with apple earphones, which are okay but hurt my ears as I am not used to them. I prefer to use my own headphones. It also comes with a very easy to follow guide, a USB charger cord, and the iTunes CD (another great program, by the way). When I first saw the nano I thought it was way too small (and it is very small) but after about a day I was completely used to it's size. To me the regular iPod is huge now. As for some of the cons I've seen in these reviews: sure, it is fragile, but if you take care of it that's not an issue. If you put it back after you use it, it won't get scrathed up at all. Naturally, if you drop an ipod on the floor it will break, but that isn't the nano's fault. It wasn't designed for people dropping it."
4,"Here comes the sexy, ultra portable Nano iPod","[...]Review:This will be the best selling player on the market. With a color screen, ultra portability, the nano is awesome. But, there are major flaws such as scratches. I know the ipod tend to scratch easily. But just one day in my pocket the nano was full of scratches, which is ridiculous. Buy the white nano because you won't see as many scractches. Also buy a screen protector!!! You will be thanking me later. Also, there seems to be a little buzz in the background when you play an mp3 song.Will cont. to update."
4,Review from a runner,"This gaget is a great way to take your entire library out with you when you exercise. Most people are aware of the plusses... I thought I'd write up what I think are negatives.-- I didn't like how you have to purchase a sleeve to carry the ipod in. Most mp3 players come with this accessory. (You also have to purchase other accessories, which I think is a racket)-- Choosing which songs or playlist you listen to is difficult when you're on the move. My other players have buttons that are easy to feel and navigate once you learn where they are.--For the same reason, it's also difficult to change the volume.When running, I actually prefer my older mp3 player that doesn't hold as many songs as my ipod. I think if I had known it was so difficult to search and change the settings while running I'd have chosen a different player."
3,Nano review,"Sounds good, plays well, easy to pack around but rather fragile. My daughter put it in her back pack and when she pulled it back out the screen was unreadable (broken)."
5,My Best Purchase this Year,I am so very happy that I purchased the white Apple 4G iPod!I have used it everyday since. It is so Easy to learn how to use.I have downloaded 525 songs still have lots to go. Also I am a picture freak (I have 6 daughters!) and so happy that this one holds all my Photos!Highly Highly recommend!
4,NANO'licious review,"OK, so the black apple ipod nano. REALLY FAST, even with heaps of song on it, it still keeps up with your fingers. it is VERY EASILY scratched, so watch it! The sounds is fantastic! True story i was on the bus and i got told tp turn it down cause the people at the back could here it (SERIOUSLY) The screen is outstanding, the graphics are almost unbeliveable for such a small screen. The back light works great at night, but note to self: in day-light the screen is very hard to see. The photo storage part works ""O.K"" its a bit annoying to get used to.I WOULD DEFINATLY recomend this ipod to anyone."
1,Not yet Recieved this Item,"I ordered this item on Nov. 25, 2005. It was in stock at that time. I wish I would have known I would have gone elswhere as I am going to do now."
4,It's an iPod --- what more do you say?,"I am giving it a 4 due to the simple fact of battery replacement. I am not looking forward to the day that it simply doesn't hold a charge anymore. But, I am confident that by that time, some 3rd party smartie will have an aftermarket battery solution. Keeping my fingers crossed...."
3,Comment on Length of Play on a Battery Charge,"Apple says that the Nano lasts 12-14 hours on a battery charge. Don't believe it. Their high estimate is based on if you let the thing play straight through without manually changing songs, adjusting the volume, etc. Every time you do that you deplete the charge more than if you just let one song play after another. I just got my Nano 2 weeks ago and quickly loaded 900 songs onto it. I have the most fun putting the thing on shuffle mode and forwarding through songs that I haven't heard in a while. I'll listen to all or part of a song or skip it entirely. Or adjust the volume. Every time I do this the backlight comes on (you can turn it off but then you can't see the display unless you are in very bright direct light). I estimate that if you like to fiddle with your Nano (Didn't your mother tell you not to fiddle with your Nano?) you'll only get about 5 hours on a charge."
4,Great New Toy!,I am very happy with the new iPod I purchased. I've only had it about a month & already have 375 songs on it. No problems. Delivery was quick & easy too.
1,Great for Audio Books,"I bought the nano instead of the larger capacity Ipods because it can hold enough audio in the form of podcasts and audio books without having to worry about the delicacy of a hard drive mechanism. In less than a month I've worked through four audiobooks on my one hour commute...some of them 15 hour reads. At a reasonably good sample rate, I can theoretically store nearly 600 hours of audio.I ordered the Belken FM Modulator with the Nano. It works well for in-car listening with the bonus of picking up adjacent vehicle satellite radio listening on occassion...you'd be surprised who listens to Howard Stern!"
4,Perfect...Except,"I purchased this holster for my new job at a local hardware store chain and found it to be great, even with a Stanley ""L shape"" knife (more contoured for your hand, like the knife in the picture). Only problem I found is the clip, it clips like a cell phone holster and I wear a tool belt so it would unclip from the belt and on to my pants. So because I carry more than just a knife I just purchased the Rear Gaurd 54045 by Bocket Boss, this sheath has a different clip system and I hope it works well."
3,Well??,"Well, I bought it because it was on my brother's wish list. When I got it, I was like, where's the pencil and knife? Then, I looked at the description again and saw it's not included? Hmmm ... makes sense why it was so inexpensive. Wonder if my brother knows there is no knife and pencil."
3,Acceptable quality,"The Low Pressure guage wouldn't show more than 5"" of Vac when it arrived. I called and reported it to Mastercool and they sent a replacement guage. The new LP guage worked properly and it only took a couple of days to arrive. I have only used this unit about a dozen times since buying it, but it seems to be a lot better than the cheap ones offered for only a few bucks less at the auto parts stores."
3,power electronics,ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE AS A STUDENT I THINK THE BOOK GIVES US THE STUDENTS A GOOD AND COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION IN THE SUBJECT OF VARIABLE SPEED DRIVES AND THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF POWER CONVERTERS THAT EVERY STUDENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SHOULD HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF.
5,Brilliant History & Analysis of A Tragically Divided City.,"South African Apartheid remains alive and well, as this study of brutal resettlement programs illustrates. Nelson Mandela's failure to protect the human and civil rights defenseless Cape Town minorities is nothing short of criminal. Author's focus is primarily on ""Cape Coloureds"", people of mixed race. Written from the unique perspective of a British social geographer, now on the faculty of a major American university."
1,I wish I had my money back.,"This book was a waste of time and money. This is the worst technical book I have ever read. The second bullet on the the cover states, ""Learn how to develop and intergrate the SD module with your existing SAP R/3 system."". This is very misleading as this book is nothing more than a high-level overview of SD and goes into no detail on ""how"" to develop anything. I also have the MM book by the same name and it also is worthless."
2,SAP online help with a glossy cover,"The book content of this book is composed of:1. an enhanced reprint of the SAP online help2. blunt advertisingImplementing SAP for large multinationals, I was looking for a book that provides a backup when configuring SD. It is definitely not an implementation reference for experienced SAP consultants, although the title partly suggests that.The internet part is o.k. and as reference for using SAP (excluding any IMG configuration) it may be useful.What really annoys me is the subtile advertising within the book. We all know that SAP currently is the best solution available, but we also know its weaknesses and there are quite a few of them. A bit more honesty would honor the audience."
3,Outdated,"You know your dealing with a book that's outdated when you read ""Most first loans are made by savings and loans associations."" No offense intended to the author but although many of the concepts are good, they are not well-explained or presented for beginners to easily understand. I only understood as much as I did because I am in the real estate industry. Better choices are out there."
2,lame,"For a fan of Gilda Radner, this movie was a big disappointment. I thought she died of cancer, but maybe she really died of embarrassment over appearing in this movie. I'd say the primary culprit is the writer, but I'd like to point out to the director (S. Poitier) that having the actors scream their lines, doesn't make them any funnier.Note to parents and the squeamish: The movie opens with some fairly distressing scenes. I definitely would not show it to my preteens."
2,go gilda,"wilder and gilder, the names look like they rhyme, but they are pronounced differently. of course, it's not gilder, it's gilda. and it's past my bedtime."
4,it is a short video w/ some old and some neew bands on it,"it is good enough to buy. take it. all the videos are excellent except for the last two but that us my opinion. nofx, rancid, guttermouth, lagwagon, white kaps, pennywise, this video if filled. other bands are shlong, spunk, slapshot"
2,Not good at all real waste! BEWARE,"First, I would not call the host an expert knitter. Her continental style is very sloppy. the complete beginner's guide was MUCH better. this is for the complete novice. I picked this up to learn cont. style and long tail cast on. She goes WAY to fast in the long tail cast one. Other times are very slow.She even pauses to count her stitches in an example....what a waste of time. a novice would do much better to watch a youtube clip. there is no real value to this dvd. unlike complete beginner DVD which you can keep going back to, to learn more. not sure why the other reviews are so high. Just wanted to let folks know the truth."
4,Great Read!,"This is another great book by Jasmine Cresswell. Keeps you wondering until the end. Definitely try and read her other books, they are also very good."
3,Appealing characters mix with turgid prose,"I really like Jesamine Cressell's novels, but in THE CONSPIRACY she almost writes two books. One has an appealing hero and heroine with an intriguing ""problem."" At the same time, we had page upon page of turgid prose describing the political situation in Khasmir and lots of pages that must have been written from someone's notes. I liked the major characters; I skipped the many boring parts. Now I'm taking my copy of the book to a second hand bookstore. It's not a keeper."
3,Entertaining but grating on the ears,"I've never been able to understand what is so great about Elaine Stritch's singing. It's simple: she can't sing. I've tried and tried to like her, and I do, as an actress, but NOT as a singer. Listening to these CDs, all I hear is a grouchy old lady voice with no vibrato, no range, and no ability to hold notes. If she were to try out for American Idol she would get cringes! I love her humor and honesty, and that's why I bought this, but the voice...ugh."
5,Nothing Like a Dame,"Elaine Stritch is absolutely one of a kind and this performance proves it. No one will ever match her ""Ladies Who Lunch"" Should be part of your ""classics"" collection"
5,If you want to know what's great about the theatre...,"....spend an evening there with Elaine Stritch in her one-woman show. It's truly amazing. I saw her in the front row in Los Angeles and a more brilliant night I cannot remember. She's got guts. She's got style. She's got class. And, really, there aren't many more of them like that.One newspaper review said something along the lines of ""Someday, the world will be divided into two groups -- those who saw 'Elaine Stritch at Liberty' and those who wish they had."" I went in thinking, ""Well, that's got to be an overstatement...and came out wanting to be sure I was on the list of those who had seen it and were so happy to have done so.She's funny and tragic and has a tale about everyone and everything. If life is a journey, she's taken an amazing one. Buy the CD. Buy the DVD. And then be thankful they've invented the technology to preserve forever a great show and a great night at the theatre."
1,never again,"Purchased two N.O.S. Mondaine watches on a close out special,installed fresh batteries.One never worked the other only worked sporadicly .Avoid this brand."
3,beauty and poignancy,"Out of print for nearly 50 years, New York Review Books has happily reprinted this slim, charming, nearly forgotten classic by Schuyler, best known as a poet. Told entirely through the dialogue, letters, and diary entries of two very precocious children -- Alfred and Guinevere, sent to live in the country with their uncle and grandmother for reasons not entirely clear to them -- Schuyler brilliantly and hilariously portrays their attempts to piece together the larger, enigmatic adult world around them. Beneath the book's apparently guileless surface, there also lies a sophisticated awareness of the complicated ways in which words work to define the boundaries between fantasy and reality, innocence and knowledge. Thoroughly delightful, Alfred and Guinevere will move you with both beauty and poignancy."
5,Mini CD-R User,"I've used these for a couple years now. They're roughly the size of the 1.44mb floppy discs. They fit into a shirt pocket easily.Now that so few computers come with floppy drives these are great when you need to share data, pictures, want to give someone a small sample of your recorded voice either reading or singing. For those who can remember how great floppies were when you wanted to share 1.44 mb of stuff... well these are great when you'd like to share 210mb with friends."
1,"""nice cover art...""","The cover of this DVD may be viewed in all global regions, regardless of which dvd player you own...Unfortunately, the DVD itself, was unplayable in a Region 1 player(as described on Amazon)...The disc sent by the seller was manufactured in Argentina and was unplayable in a Sony DVD player...Buyer beware..."
2,"Eagerly anticipated, muchly disappointed","I thought this book was very sad. I was looking forward to it immensely after reading the first. I was hoping that with a woman in control of a city things would be really interesting, but Tharna is a total disappointment."
4,EXILE'S RETURN,"Tarl Cabot's long exile was over. Again he was back on Gor, the strange world of Counter-Earth, where he had once been the proudest warrior and mightiest tarnsman of that savage planet. But nothing was as it had been. His home city of Ko-ro-ba was destroyed, razed until not one stone remained standing. His beautiful mate, Talena was dead or vanished. His family and friends were scattered across the globe. And Cabot was now declared an outlaw, with all men ordered to kill him on sight. His only chance was to find the strange Priest-Kings who ruled Hor and to submit himself to them. But Tarl was not about to submit!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This book is a little better than the first one. Tarl Cabot had been sent home to Earth, and several years have passed while he has lived there.He again ends up in Gor, and finds out that many things have changed. The city where he used to live now no longer exists, which, politically makes him clanless, or an outlaw.Outlaws of course get involved in violence and adventure."
5,What's Number One?,"I loved it, it's a great, great book. I was kind of confused at first because I haven't read the first one. What is it? I really want to know."
4,His writting is improving,"The first couple of books in this series did not keep my attention as well as I thought it should have. As I have continued to read this series, I can see Mr. Norman has improved his writing and his way of story telling. The creation of the Gorean world, while not original, Mr. Norman's slant is refreshing. It seems that he is exploring his view of the differences between what evolution wants a Man to be and what evolution wants a Woman to be. I look forward to reading more in this series."
1,"One Word: ""Editor""","There is no excuse for charging money for a book without an editor. There's no consistancy between the text and the diagrams.Additionally, the LDAP section assumes a great deal of background in X.500 as the author spews forth his opinions."
2,needed an editor badly!,"This book provided some information on configuring and implementing Active Directory but overall was pretty poorly written and seems to not have passed by an editors eyes at all. Many of included diagrams added nothing to the discussion - others were mislabelled or otherwise didn't match what the text was saying. So, to sum up, this appears to be a hastily published effort to get out before or when Win2k released. I'm still looking for the right book - currently reading Windows 2000 Active Directory by Alistair Lowe-Norris"
1,Save paper and remove this book from print,This book is not worth getting even if it was given away. The way the author writes about active directory makes me wonder if he even has an MCSE. Poorly written book. Avoid this book.
1,A waste of paper,This book is a complete waste of time. Minimal useful information. Do yourself a favor and get one of the many others on the shelves. The two 5 star reviews that it received make me wonder if those individuals even read the same book!
1,Don't bother buying it - Nothing useful in this book,"I didn't get any value out of this book that I couldn't find on the Internet. There was nothing new, in fact - some of it was written in a way to cauas misunderstandings about the true nature of it. There was nothing in the book that let you know HOW you could actually USE the Active Directory. What a waste of money!"
2,Good Text - Horrible Diagrams,The actual text of this book is decent but constantly refers the reader to diagrams that actually confuse more than help. It's a good start but not enough.
4,Content was helpful for experienced readers,"I found this book helpful though I have had a background with the W2K product line since it was released. I decided to forego some of the reviews found here and try the book based on Wiley's excellent background in publishing. While I did find that some of the representations and editing were a bit weak, overall the book was an excellent source information on planning and implementing Active Directory. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Disappointing!,This book was so disappointing! It lacked applicability to using the Active Directory.
3,Does not fit 2009 F-150 XLT without drilling,"The tabs and holes do not align with the fender...not even close. Installation accomplished with a little ingenuity and drilling. Good quality product disregarding the fit. After installing, the tabs and connectors designed to tuck behind the metal trim are at least 1 inch away. Not very good design for the F-150 XLT."
1,a bad brand of carrier,the seller was a good seller and did a nice job get it on time. but this product i am rate poorly. i brought this product for my new kitten and it is not reliable. the cage came apart while take my kitten to the vet last week i almost lost my brand new kitten when the cage collapse on me. I Do not trust this cage and will never use it again my kitten almost got hit by a car if it wasn't for one my vet staff who got her in time. This experince left me pretty shook up.
2,NOT SO BIG,I ordered a MED. size carrier for my small siamese kitten going by the products description & recommendation per the size of my kitten. I would hate to see what one of their small kennel really looks like because about the only pet that would probably fit would be a lizard. The plastic and the way its made is very cheep & not as sturdy as the kennels you can purchase @ Walmart or your local pet store and their sizes are correct. So its worth the $10 more you may spend buying a kennel local!! I would'nt recommend to anyone buying a Petmate Kennel!!!
1,An utter defective mess...,"Cheaply made. I put it together and parts fell off. I could not get the door to fit in the slot, I would have had to use a lot of force.I would not recommend this kennel to anyone."
4,Good For The Price,"It is perfict for my dog she is about 17 pounds. Looks exactly like picture. It is really easy to put together, takes less the 5 min. The only problem I had with it was that once one of the snaps to keep the top and bottom together came loose. I did not notice until I came home and my dog was jumping at my feet (not in the kennel where I had left her). It was an easy fix. I just had to take it apart and put it back together. It has not happend again."
5,Great-Love it!!,I Love this pink kennel I purchased for my kittie-already took her to the vet in it and it worked great!!
3,"Petmate Copolymer Plastic/Steel Lifestyle Kennel Cab, Medium, Lady Pink/Dark Pink","Petmate Copolymer Plastic/Steel Lifestyle Kennel Cab, Medium, Lady Pink/Dark Pink, It arrived with some small damage, since the damage was something that I could live with, I kept it. It serves it's purpose. This item also need a standard size chart other than (Small, Medium, and Large)."
3,Not so impressed!,"It's pretty and comfortably for my dog, but is kinda cheaply made. I'll use it, but it's not the best quality."
3,It will do,The clasps on the side seem hard to close sometimes but it's really not that big of a deal. It still works great. It holds my 13lb dog ok but holds my 5lb dog easily
4,Perfect Listening for Rainy Days,"Picture Music remains something of an anomoly in Schulze's canon. Rather than the long, sweeping synth pads and choirs on other albums of this period, it relies primarily on a chunky, fascinating bass line that flows effortlessly underneath gentle and moody solos. Side 2 is less successful, employing an awkward drum kit and some synth work that is a little too invasive, but overall this album is a essential for any Schulze fan. It could also serve as a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the Old Master because of it's bassline hook and flowing rhythm."
1,Pure Propaganda,"September 11th was orchestrated by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, etc with the help of the FBI, CIA, and NSA. It has been proven that nano-thermite was used to destroy WTC1, 2, and 7. This was a false flag attack used to manipulate and scare the American people. It was used to push through the Patriot Act, which severely limited our 1st and 4th amendment rights. It was also used to orchestrate countless wars under the guise of ""protecting freedom"". This ""report"" is complete whitewash propaganda garbage, and even those who wrote it didn't believe it.Read this instead:Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe[...]"
4,Good referense source,I found this book very helpfull in preparing for the core tech exam but i found that it doesn't focus enough on subnetting and supernetting and i had to refer to external refrences to learn these subjects and to my surprise the test was full of subneting questions! over all its a very good book because it gives you good information and leaves out the usless stuff!
2,okay i suppose,"I could hardly get through it. Though the story is ok, it takes too long to tell. The author also seems to have some sort of obsession with phallic structures. She uses them to describe things that shouldn't be described with them. Actually, the only reason I remember any of it is because of these stupid descriptions. Wow, I don't think that this book is worth reading at all."
1,"Terrible book: Weak plot, bad main events, very bad ending.","I was forced to read this book for my English class and didn't have a problem with it when I started it. In the beginning of the first chapter she was in sixth grade and by the end she was alright all grown up, given a child, and had left home. The next sixteen chapters went by slow and boring. I had to force myself to keep reading this dull, poorly written book. I think that it could have been extremely more intresting and should not be given the credit that it has been given so far. I would strongly urge you to NOT read this book."
1,This sucked,"This was a terrible book. It had a dull plot and and the charactors were flat. This is one book I would not recomend to anyone, not even an enemy."
1,My love for this book ^_^,"This book is twenty years old. This book is supposed to be good. Somehow it's a bestseller? This book is terrible! It does not have good descriptions, it conveys things poorly and over all a quarter of the story is driving! Do not read unless you like bad literature, enjoy. o_o"
1,I am a frastrated parent,"My son is a junior and he had to read this book in his English class. He hated it so much that he could not make himself open it. I could not find an audio cassette for him so I ended up reading it for him every night (so that he does not fail). I have to tell you that I am a book lover. I cannot fall asleep without a book in my hands. But I hate this book too! First of all, the poor language. I don't know what kind of English kids can learn reading it. It's a language of poorly educated americans. The contents are not very exciting either. Bad choice!"
1,Bean Trees sucks,Bean Tress sucks. Turtles a dumb ass. She's mentally retarted. Taylor should have given Turtle to Child Services. She also should have given the illegals up to INS. Terrible book. WASTE OF YOUR MONEY>
4,Great first novel,"This was Kingsolver's first novel. At first I felt disappointed that the writing was not as poetic and lyrical as in PRODIGAL SUMMER, but then realized that that type of writing would not have fit this story. It needed to be gritty and real.I thoroughly enjoyed this story of a young woman's coming into her own and deciding what was important to her. I'm looking forward to the sequel, PIGS IN HEAVEN."
5,This book changed my universe!,"The Bean Trees, by Barbara Kingsolver is literary fiction of the first order. Not only is it well-written, an interesting plot, and superbly characterized, it posesses a heartfelt moral vision of America and what America stands for, and should stand for. This book should be required reading for all Americans and Earthlings. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Ms. Kingsolver's politics (I agree) one must admit that a moral vision is presented in this book without being preachy or self righteous or ""whiny"" as much as that is hated these days. The Bean Trees is about the fact that what we've been brought up to believe is not necessarily true for others or for ourselves. It is a novel of compassion, hope, family, and the fact that the cult of ""American individualism"" is not only a lie, but is unnatural and wrong and unhealthy for human beings; we all need to help and be helped. Your life will be richer for reading this book!"
3,Well written but not much of a story,"I clearly enjoy the writing of Barbara Kingsolver and wish I could write half as well. Her characters are human and she has the ability to involve us with their experiences. However, this story did not seem like much of a story to me though one reads on just to see what happens in the lives of ordinary people."
5,Moving ON,"Life doesn't always go the way you plan, especially for Taylor Greer in The Bean Trees. Taylor, a strong, optimistic girl wanting to break free and see if she can survive on her own learns that you have to take what you are given and make the best of it. An unexpected child somehow enters her life and she neutures and takes care of it as if it were her own. Struggling to find a place to live, she lives each day to the fullest and pulls through. This novel will entrigue you, making you want to never take your eyes off the pages to find out what adventure Taylor is going to go through next."
2,Tucsonian,"Living in Tucson and having migrated here from the Midwest at about the same age as the main character, and being from a blue-color background and having worked in the area the book talks about I think the author's characters are from a fantasy world and represent the authors personal politics. I found the characters very boring and self-indulging. It is a good example of liturature that doesn't present the opposing views of life that make reading meaningful to me.I almost made it half way before I said I don't have to read anymore of this book and exchanged it at the library."
4,Impressive,"Although I thought it somewhat flawed by overplotting, especially in the last third, ""The Bean Trees"" is a gorgeously written novel with a delightfully human tone. A rare recent book acceptable in high school English, ""The Bean Trees"" and its sequel have been virtually the only books this year I have read for English and liked."
4,This Book was Great I would read it again!!!!!!,I was forced to read this book for a literature assignment. At first I was confused and didn't understand the book because of the constant switch to diffrent scences every chapter switch but then it began to come together.When I finally got into the book I could hardly put it down. I am not a stay at home and read person but I really enjoyed this book and recomend it to anyone who is into the topic.
4,"Beautifully written, light reading","The style is very engaging and the characters well-drawn and interesting. The book is a very easy and quick read, but not very challenging. Personally, if I am going to put aside time to read a book, I want challenges such as symbolism and complex characters.. not the case here, but I would still recommend the book. I bought this for my reading group but do not see what there will be to discuss."
3,The Bean Trees,"It's been a while since I read this book. It was an ok read. Not a great piece of literature if that is what you are looking for. This book kind of reminds me of ""Where the Heart Is"" only a bit darker & strange. The circumstances surrounding the plot are not realistic at all, so I would check reality at the door when reading this one..."
4,An Enlightening Book,"When my mother first recommended this book to me I didn't even want to look at it. But from the moment I picked it up I was intrigued. Not that there was anything particularly interesting about the first chapter, but there is something about the language that is gripping. Maybe because it seems so personal, I don't know. But this book was such an excellent read I chose it for my Independant Study Unit ( Although finding secondary sources i.e. essays, were impossible to find)"
4,It was moving,"This novel was an interesting novel. It moved me. It was so descriptive. It was so perfect the way that Barbara Kingsolver put the events and everything together. This book was funny, sad and nerve-wracking. The way Taylor and Turtle accepted each other so quickly showed that they both had trust in each other. This novel shows you the true meaning of love and true friendship. Unlike other books, this book catches your attention at all times. It is so far away from being boring."
4,Funny yet Serious,"Kingsolver's voice permeates throughout this brilliant work. Though funny and lighthearted, it is a book with a subtly serious message..."
4,Interesting. They grow on trees?,"This was an interesting read. Not a fast one, but a good, well written, interesting story that draws you into the life of the main character and her ""adopted"" daughter. If you like Kingsolver's ""Poisonwood Bible"" (and I loved it) you'll not regret the time you spend with her in the west on this book."
4,touching,"Barbara Kinsolver has written a very touching story about family, friendship, love and strength. Almost all the characters are women and it is wonderful to see how they all grow in their own ways! Turtle is so precious and fragile, you want to pick her up and hug her! I love this book, it is a story that can make you believe in the goodness of people."
4,Great book! First Chapter lacks hook.,"This book was written with seamless literary connections, and was fun to read at the same time. The author's characters are multidemintional and real. The story is flawless. My only complaint is the first chapter lacked a hook to catch the reader, but the rest of the book will keep anybody from putting it down!"
3,The Bean Trees is Good,"The Bean Trees followed a young woman's journey through life. Missy, a poor Kentuckian, learns the hard way that lifes adventure comes at a price when she is given an abused child to raise. Together, they must survive. The author, Barabara Kingsolver, writes of the joys and pains of life. The plot was quite complex, but it can also be summed up in one word: life. There are many themes to this book, one of which is the political. It tells of the ignorace of Americans and their inability to care for the crimes and injustice of the world. The characters spanned a great spectrum, from the one legged Rodeo Rider, to the immagrant smuggling used tire salesman. I must give this book 3 stars because I am into genres other than sci-fi. Her style was great and The Bean Trees was good."
3,A touching and inspiring book,"The bean tree may be the most touching and relaxing books I have ever read. This inspiring book brings you from state to state and meeting so many other people. The main character is probably one of those characters you would never forget. She has a very unique personality and style. When she met this little one that changed her life forever, you could probably picture the scene with your imagination and that is the time you will never want the story to end. If you are emtional and sensitive, you would fall in love with ""The Bean Tree"""
3,Easy book to read,"I read the Bean Trees, by Barabara Kingsolver, as a sophomore in High School. Now as a senior at a different school, I was again required to read The Beans Trees for a novel project. I had no problem reading it twice, it was an okay book and an easy A! This novel is a journey of a young woman named Taylor Greer. It is a book about love, friendship, growing up fast, finding who you really are, and belonging in the world. This was one of the most easiest books I have ever read, and I would recommend it for people who like happy, upbeat books. The only problem I had with this book is that some of the chapters were boring and you just wanted to get through them. But if you look past that, it gets the readers attention and you just want to find out what happens between Taylor and Turtle (the child she was left with) at the end. If you want an easy book, this is it!"
4,Hope springs eternal for those willing to change their names,"Ms. Kingsolver reels you in to a small town only to quickly throw you back into the cruel harsh world. The changing names of characters and the hidden world of the refugees exist in our world even though we cannot always recognize them. I loved the way the main character held on to her ""head rights,"" not realistically, but to combat her own insecurity. In the end, she is strong enough to overcome her fears and finds she doesn't need to fall back on anything. Yes, it was idealistic, but it was well written and made me feel better about the people I live with in this world."
3,Just not to my liking!,"I found it very difficult to get through this book. I stopped once, but was encouraged to finish it by others who have liked it. I'm sorry to say that I never found the story very exciting. I thought the action was less than believable and did not feel an affinity for any of the characters."
1,100 Words or Less,"The only memory I have of reading this novel 20 years ago is chasing my roommate around the apartment reading aloud, while she covered her ears and screamed for me to stop. Yeah, the prose is that stilted, hackneyed, predictable, and plain old lazy.The characters are flat. The situation is reworked from hundreds of other novels. The ending is stupid in its warm fuzzy falseness. Ugh.I guess I took it all too seriously. I suppose if you're looking for a light, breezy, mindless read, this would work ... but why? You have so many better options out there."
3,So-So,This book isn't one I would run out and HAVE to buy there were parts I laughed at and parts I was saddened by and there were parts that I was thinking alright on with it already so all in all this book is O.K. that is all I can say if you are bored try it.
3,The Bean Trees,"The book started off a bit vague, lacking something necessary to hold my attention. Once past the second chapter the characters lives picked up and the plot became more interesting, the chapters had a tendency to skip between two characters toward the begining, this left me confused where these characters would later coralate in the book when finally as the climax came their paths crossed, and I found the book to be quite enjoyable."
1,Worst book I've ever read.,"Before I start I have to say I read this book for an English class, but regardlessly it is still terrible. There are so many incredible events in this book that it seems fake. The characters are uninteresting. The author depicts male horribly. In short, if you don't have to read this book DON'T."
3,Something To Do,"I read this book because it was assigned to my daughter for summer reading. Although I did find some of the situations humorous, I never could figure out why Taylor decided to keep Mattie. Her relationships with other people were more fully developed than with Mattie, and I kept waiting for some evidence that she was beginning to love the little girl, but all of a sudden she decides to keep her and goes to great lengths to do so. Some of the other situations in the book didn't ring true either. Overall the book was less then satisfying, but an easy afternoon's read if you want something to do."
3,Politically Correct Reading,"During the first 3/4 of the book, someone could have snatched the book away and I wouldn't have blinked an eye, although the characters were well-drawn and the the dialog was full-bodied. The author was full of missionary zeal about illegals, as if all undocumented entries were made of the pure material of the two portrayed in this book. The book sang of spirit and hope, no wonder it is required reading for the students in Arizona."
1,Pathetic.,"That word sums up the entire book...I had to read it for my English class, but regardless, it's an awfully dull book. It's feministic and there is no plot to speak of. The characters are fairly well developed, but apart from that, it's just a waster of time."
2,in reply to stu,"this book was boring, in the end Turtle dies and Taylor, broken hearted, commits suicide. but that was the only good part. i would NOT reccomend this to ANYONE. RIGHT ON STUBERT! hewnawnnwnwaa"
2,"Wasn't the kind of ""hardcover"" that I expected.","The book was described as ""hardcover."" Technically, it was. However, it was only a small paperback-sized book with a hard cover. And I hate the small paperback books, that is why I buy only hardcover books which are usually full-size. Disappointed."
1,"Do yourself a faver, don't read this book!","This book really did stink. A horrible waste of time and effort to read. When I first started reading the book, I was genuinely interested. The first chapter left me with a feeling of suspense. But after that, the book really goes downhill, starting at the point when Taylor acepts a baby from a total stranger. The characters were dull, and the book gave you no incentive to turn the next page. This book is only fit to be used for kindling on those long cold winter nights."
4,Alanna's Review,The Bean Trees was a very entertaining book. I found that I could easily connect with the main character and the problems she encounterd. The story was real and believable. I would recommend this book to anyone. But I do believe that young women will most enjoy as well as appreciate it.
4,An interesting tale,"Barbara Kingsolver has a way of telling stories about people's everyday lives which causes the reader to become very interested and involved with the characters. In this book, young Taylor Greer has spent her adolescence in a rural area of Kentucky with her main objectives being to keep from getting pregnant and to complete high school. This accomplished, she decides after working in a local hospital for awhile that she needs to go to another place to live. On her way to her eventual destination, she is given a young Indian child by someone she meets on the way. Not sure of where she'll end up or what she will do with the young child, she continues her journey and manages to find a job, a place to live, and some friends. Another feature of Kingsolver books is that the reader is lulled with everyday occurances until something very monumental and sometimes unexpected happens. This book is true to form and a lurking background of dysfunction gives way to a promising future."
5,The Bean Trees,"I read this book for school, and from the first page, I knew this book would be different from any I've read. It's extremely insightful and passionate and the story is written so well. The main character, Taylor, starts off on a journey to get away from home, but ends up running into everything she ran away from. She meets new people, unexpectedly receives an abused child, and learns from mistakes and decisions for herself. From this she grows and experiences, and gains a new respect for life, love, and why she ended up where she is. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to read a great book."
4,Wonderful!!,"I read this book for a school project I will be doing. The title of the book, didn't exactly draw me in, so to speak, I was reluctant to reading it, especially after the first chapter. But as you read through the book the farther along you get, the more you realize how much you start relating to Taylor and how wonderful Barbara Kingsolver is as a writer. Kingsolver's writing style is thourghly enjoyable. She paints a picture in your mind as you read thorugh her 'golden nuggets'. I loved this book and would reccommend this book to everyone, it is wonderful!~"
5,GREAT BOOK,"Even if this book title is a little bit not appealing, this book is awsome... I just got done reading it for a english class that I have at school... I recomend it to anybody that is a christian and going through hard troubles... This book alludes to the bible very much and since I'm not a person that will sit down and read when I'm bored this give the book more of a meaning to me."
5,Shocking story of Family Values,"Imagine leaving your hometown because you don't want to suffer the same fate of being ""barefoot and pregnant,"" only to have to take the responsibility of a child you really didn't need. The Bean Trees is an amazing book that gets your attention from page 1 to the end. A story of the value of family and friendship, brought to present times. What makes this book so great is the connection to present day struggles. A must read book."
4,Delightful read.,"I loved the homey, quirky dialogue in Taylor's voice. I would love to hang out with Barbara Kingsolver for a year or two."
4,Good story,A good relaxing Sunday afternoon read. I read it from start to finish without having to get up. Enjoyed the story.
3,"The premise was interesting, the characters were well drawn if unbelievable, on the whole well written","Economic poverty is well depicted, you feel the helplessness and the dangers. Refreshing to read the reality of teen age pregnancy, without the romanticizing. Barbara Kingsolver illuminated a certain way of life."
4,The Bean Trees,"This book was not what I expected. It was an easy read and interesting to follow the sometimes strange adventures of the heroine. While the novel did touch on some of the social issues of the day, it was not heavy or didatic."
3,Excellent,"This book is not exactly exhillarating, but it hits home for those of you who know the struggles of life just handing you something and telling you to deal with it."
3,"Character and charisma, entertains while addressing issues","The book was an enjoyable read. It contained issues that are relevant in todays society without preaching views to you. The language was simple to follow without begin insultingly easy. A nice book to read on a quiet, easy going day. There were parts of the book that I found to be very beautiful and symbolic in the midst of the reality of everyday life. Overall the book was appealing and a good read."
5,"I want a ""Damn, I'm Good"" T-Shirt!!","I am still laughing about the baby wearing that t-shirt saying: ""Damn, I'm Good"". And the woman at the motel whose head kept nodding as if she were signalling no to someone behind Taylor's head. The doorhandle at the club next to Jesus is Lord that had the woman's belly button on it. People taking care of people. For the way Ms. Kingsolver managed to pack so much tolerance, random kindness and unconditional love into one relatively short book, I will always be grateful."
2,Not nearly as good as everyone said!!!!,I loved the description of this book- it sounded like something I would enjoy. I was wrong. I read the reviews and most were glowing...... but I was bored!!!! Didn't keep my attention! NOT worth the money at all
4,The first of many terrific novels,"Kingsolver's earliest, and one more jewel in her sparkling crown. I know I can pick up anything she's written and get high-quality writing and crystal clear characters. This meets those expectations well. Taylor grows up in small town Kentucky, and escapes to Tucson where her shabby vehicle ends up forcing her to stay. Along the way, she takes infant Turtle into her life in a very unexpected way. Once in Tucson, she is fortunate enough to find Mattie and Lou Ann and several others who come to matter greatly in her life. As a character, Taylor is real, clear, wonderfully written, and easy to relate to. Even the secondary characters are well developed. Mattie is a treasure, Lou Ann, an invaluable peer, sister-like. In Kingsolver's sure hand, even little Turtle is believably and lucidly drawn. The down-home aphorisms and expressions are priceless in several characters' mouths. A treat and a pleasure. I was glad I read it and think you will be, too."
2,Low Down on Bean Trees,"Not a bad read, but kind of pointless. Good characters, but it left me feeling like I wanted more of a story..."
3,themes and characters.,"I enjoyed this book. I thought it was a fun read while also displaying some skilled plot structure and thematic development. Kingsolver's characters are like people you know, and you find yourself truly wanting them to be happy. I thought that Taylor's getting saddled with Turtle so early in her quest to escape teenage motherhood made an interesting statement about how people cannot change who they are, despite their efforts to run away from their lives. That, and that chance attachments are often the most important of our lives.Pretty funny, pretty touching, pretty good read."
5,Kingsolver's writing is hot chocolate on a cold day,This is the first time an author has grabbed my interest in such an emotional way that I'm almost impatient for her next book. After having read all but one I will drink this last book slowly like hot chocolate on a cold day. Thank you for your warmth Barbara
3,A So-So Book By An Excellent Author,"This book about a young woman fleeing her roots and taking up in the southwest held my interest long enough for me to finish it, but that's about it. This young woman has a young child thrust upon her and has to quickly become a mother figure.I am told there is a second book (this is actually a series). I have no interest in reading the second one.If you want some great Barbara Kingsolver, read ""The Poisonwood Bible"" instead."
2,Poorly written,"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver was unwillingly rammed down my throat to read by my english teacher. This book was awful. After reading it twice, once for plot, the second for inspection. I realized how ashamed Kingsolver should be for writing such an atrocity. There was absolutely no detail put into such fine details as how she escapes with this indian baby. At a glance, for uncaring readers this book may be alright. But if you cannot stand the fine line between reality, and how fake the authors reality is. You honestly want to throw-up your lunch after reading this."
3,Turtle who?,"I loved the style of writing and descriptions, but the story line wasn't captivating enough for me. And was there really something wrong with Turtle? We never found out. It rambled too much - but I still read it to the end. Not bad....will read Poisonwood next to give her another try."
4,The Bean Tree by Barbara Kingsolver,"Barbara Kingsolver has stimulated the minds of readers through her book THE BEAN TREES. In the novel, 22 year old Taylor Greer, a young woman searching for a different path in life, abandons her home town in Kentucky and travels down to the sunny state of Arizona. On her way to her new adventure Taylor is given a 3 year old child, who she names Turtle, and has no other option but including her into her life. This heartfelt novel tells the story of Taylor and Turtle as they grow and evolve their lives over time in a tire shop located in Tuscon, Arizona. Reading this book made me both tear and smile from its unexpected turns and captivating adventures. As piece of literature for all age groups to relate to, it is impossible to put it down. I recommend this novel to anyone in search of an entertaining story."
1,LETS SLEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I dont know who Barbara Kingsolver is directing this book to, but if it is teenagers then she's got a lot of work to do . This book is boring enough to put somebody asleep, and it did me! This book was not interesting in the slightest way! The hardest thing that the main character had to do was go across a STATE border with illegal aleins that were dressed like Americans, and it was sooooooooooo easy. My review on this book is that it wasn't worth my time, and the only good thing about it was that I caught up on my sleep!!!!!"
2,"A vaguely disturbing book, with simplistic characters","I was bothered by the fact that it was a-okay for Taylor to take this child, who presumably has relatives on the reservation besides her mother, away from her family. It was sort of patronizing, promoting a stereotype that Indians are alcoholics who don't pay attention to their kids, and that those kids are better off with someone else. The device that Taylor's grandfather was ""part Cherokee"" is, in my opinion, a convenient way to fend off this criticism."
1,Don't read this book,The whole theme of the novel is along the same lines as Steel Magnolias and Fried Green Tomatoes. If you despised them and considered them as big of a waste of paper as I do then just skip it.
5,I have read this book at least three or four times...,"This is the first book I have ever read by Kingsolver. The title caught my attention. For some reason, I loved this book. The other books, of Kingsolvers, that I have read haven't pulled me in as well as this one.This is a great read. I can't really tell you while, but it is well worth a try!"
1,"Boring, Pathetic and Sad.","I read every page of this boring book as it was on my high school daughter's suggested summer reading list. On page 136 Taylor Greer makes one true understatement when she says, ""I know I'm ignorant."" This story is pathetic in that when she is given the Cherokee Indian child and takes her to a motel, she sees plainly that the child has been sexually abused, yet she doesn't take the child to a doctor for several months. He then shows her x-rays where the child has had multiple fractures from abuse. The book has no wisdom, except for the proper English spoken by the Mayan teacher and what does Taylor do, but thinks she's in love with him, when his wife is along with him. This was just sad. This Kentucky hillbilly character is sarcastic and rude, and too lazy to get a starter in her car, so she doesn't have to push it. I have no intention of having my daughter read this book, as it does nothing to teach values."
1,Random [...],"This book is horrible, when I read it I cried at the obserdity of it. It starts out with the main charactor driving in a car, she stops at a bus stop and suddenly recieves a small native american child for no reason. The child's name is Turtle, she's at least three but because of sexual abuse looks like an infant. Again ridiculous. Unfortunately this book doesn't stop there, for about ten chapters she just complains and complains about how hard it is to find a man and raise a kid, tear. In the end the novel simplely implodes with no real conclusion. [...]"
2,It's all down hill from the Poisonwood Bible.,"The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there folks. Poisonwood is fabulous and I've not found her other books to be any where near as good. In fact I read The Bean Trees a few months ago and I really can't remember much about it. Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me."
2,Give me a break!,"When I first began reading The Bean Trees, I could relate to the main character. She was several years younger than I, but basically matured during the same period of time. What really got to me was that I found it highly, if not extremely unlikely that a 22/23 year old in the late 70's would even consider keeping a child that someone left in her car. If she even had considered giving the child to the proper authorities I might have found it somewhat believable. If this did appear in the book it was soo brief to have escaped my notice. This issue somehow permeated my thoughts while reading the book and for that reason I couldn't involve myself to the greatest extent.Her writing style is interesting and poetic but give me a break. I still can't believe anyone, especially with her desire to start a new life, would have kept a child. Very unrealistic how the care of the child was underplayed."
3,These are positive and negitves!,"I read the book The Bean Trees. But I really didn't like it all that much. I really don't like reading either so I guess that also counts. But if you like reading this is a good book to read. But if you were to choose this book to read for a book report don't chose this one. It's basically about this girl who adopts this child that use to live somewhere else. The girl's name was Turtle, and she was an American Indian. In the book the narrator, main character or whatever was born in Maryland and grew up in Nicholas Co. Here in Kentucky. WOW! But then she moved far away."
2,Not too good.,This book was not to interesting for me because of the plot.It started out interesting when they found Turtle but after that it got boring. Nothing else interesting happend.
2,The Bean Trees,"I like had to read this book for school and i really thought it waz boreing. Why on earth wood you name a child turtle when thta is a animals name. I thought that it had no plot excpet the part when the girl was there and she was soo mot talking because she was not her moms kid becuse she was an indian, i think cherokke. I would not recomdne this book for people who dont read a lot becuase they just wont get it. It was pretty good overall but(...) i wwod not recomend for a guy because its about girls and kids and they always complan...boreing"
2,Kingsolver at her best (and that is sad),"I just reread this book on a return flight from Italy. I fell in love with the characters Taylor Greet(Greer) and Turtle many years ago. These are two characters I often think about when I see press reports about single parenthood.(Why?) The book is just as fresh and real today as ever(Liar). Thanks to the talent of a terrific writer this book should be considered as a classic, must-read for all young people(This woman is either drunk or not sober)."
3,This book is ok for people that do not read alot.,"The Bean Trees is about a women who has lived all her life in a small town in KY and finally gets fed up and heads west. IN OK she finds a surprise that now completely will alter her life. Taylor(Missy) had spent her life avioding pergnancy and now she had a kid and was all alone. This book is a must read. It brings up political issues that divid the nation. Refugees, immgernts, and asylees, should they be granted what Americans belive to be a privelage and be allowed to stay, or should they be kicked out and sent back to be attack or killed while Americans refuse to acknowalgde it."
3,"Pleasant, warm, humane","This a pleasant story, told with warmth, humor, and humanity. I found it far from gripping, but enjoyed it well enough, and appreciated the clever ending. In reading other reviews (especially those at Amazon), I'm struck by the extremes of opinion -- some loved it, while others clearly loathed it. Among readers of the latter category are students who were required to read it in 6th and 7th grade English classes. In my view, this is not a book for children; they lack the maturity to appreciate the adult themes. Others seem to object to the strong female characters, and the sympathy given to the illegal Guatamalan immigrants. To my mind, those were positive attributes of the book. C'est la vie"
4,The Bean Trees,"I have read this book on a school assignment. I am a young black male and I found this book great even though it had nothing to do with blacks. I also read a review saying this book is too sexual, well let me tell you this right now if this book was too profane on sex for that person they must get offended very easily. The author seemed to show great dislike in pornography. Several times in this book she makes negative remarks on a local porn shop by the main characters job. This story is a wonderful tale of a young, explorious women who leaves her small town for adventure. It marks her tales of travel and on the way is forced with a young indian child from a reservation(this is not a spoiler its on the back of the book). This book is funny but also keeps you thinking of possible outcomes."
4,A Good Read,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is one of those books that is just about life - the people you meet, places you go, things you do. It explores the need one feels to help those worse off, and has an even sprinkling of comedy too ( just enough to make me laugh out loud sometimes). Over all I enjoyed the book because it finds a nice way to share the universal troubles everyone has to deal with in one way or another."
4,A Quick and Entertaining Read,"This book was a quick read and I found it entertaining and a bit witty, but I can't imagine its having been on a reading list back in the dark ages when I was in school, and I'm surprised to see that it is now.Its true that some of the characters and events in this story aren't terribly believable, while others are, but that's okay - after all, it is intended as fiction. All in all, I thought it was pretty good, and I'll probably read the sequel."
4,Nice Read,"My book club chose The Bean Trees as our monthly read and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a delightful, refreshing book about life, love, loss and the ability to overcome.If you like Fannie Flagg and Billie Letts then you will enjoy The Bean Trees."
2,A review from a student from massachusetts.,"I thought that this book was not that good. I am the type of reader that is hard to keep interested (i get distracted and bored easily), i found this book to be rather boring. It was a summer reading book for my school, along with 3 other books. I found that this one was the worst out of the 3. I am sure that people who love to read, love this book! However i didnt. I have nothing against the book but i just thought that it was rather boring and uninteresting!"
1,"The horror, the horror.","I had to read this book for high school and discovered that it was nightmarishly bad. I do not recommend it to anyone with a soul. The characters--particularly the male ones--are ridiculously stereotypical and unrealistic, while the writing style is pretentious and irritating. An excellent read for masochists."
2,BLAH!,"I read this for a book club. It didn't sound promising when it was first mentioned as a possible read but I did give it a try. I didn't really find the characters likable, therefore it was hard for me to really care about the outcome. Were Taylor and LouAnn supposed to be lesbians? I guess that you could deduce that if you cared to. I didn't like this book and definitely don't recommend it."
2,nothing special,"All and all this was not a bad book. Well written, good character development, etc. But it really didn't ""do""anything for me. You're not left thinking at the end and while reading it , I wansn't really intersted in what happened to Taylor or Turtle. If your reading for excitment, or a powerful message, foget this one."
2,Boring,I had to buy this book for class and I'm glad it was so cheap because I would never choose this book to read for leisure. It's a boring tale of one young woman's jouney to leave her home state of Kentucky. Along the way to Arizona a random woman gives her an Indian baby and runs away. She takes a job in Tucson where she meets some illegal Mexicans and some other weird characters who become her family. She then travels to Oklahoma to see the Cherokee Nation regarding making the baby her legal daughter. Then she goes home to Tucson and I guess lives happily ever after. The writing is typical southern speak which I'm not fond of.
2,If I Had Known,"This was the suggested book for my local book club.... When our moderator asked our opinion of the book, there was silence!If I had known what a boring book this was going to be, I would have read the first, middle and end of the book and left it at that. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
1,H8ted it,"I thought that it was really boring, and the struggles that a lot of the characters overcame weren't really that intersesting. I thought that Taylor didn't bother to look at the world from any point of view but her own and was obnoxious. I also hated her friend and I pretty much thought that the only reason that the people's lives were as bad as they were is because they didn't try to improve it with everything they had. They were too clingy. And the entire Talor kissing the married guy really stupid and unsensitive on her part."
1,Sadly the tapes don't work properly,"I wish I could have enjoyed this book but the tapes didn't work, I won't be buying used books on tape anymore."
4,Enchanting book,"A friend encouraged me to read this book, as a ""change of pace"" from my usual choice of reading material. I have to say, it was an enchanting book. Kingsolver's style is very readable. Her use of dialect creates characters that are both three dimensional and enjoyable. Her attention to the small details of environment instill a strong sense of visual reality to what she describes and elicit an emotional commitment from the reader with a success that many authors fail to acheive. The journey of Tayler, nee Mariette, Greer is one not only through the landscape or even through time, but through life's experiences. She seems to grow in depth as she takes on each new challenge. Her involvement with others and their dependence on her show a strength that many of us would like to claim as our own. A very companionable book."
3,"Touching, but not compelling","After reading The Prodigal Summer and The Poisonwood Bible, I was disappointed in this effort by Kingsolver. The story is sweet, but does not move me to change my life or views on the world and Kingsolver's other books have. Some plot lines seem a little unfinished and rough. Also, the author is a little too blatant at times in sharing her political views, and the book reads more like a political pamphlet than a novel. Nevertheless, the author's overall storytelling ability makes the book a plesant and easy read."
5,This book deals with the the things life is made of.,"Thank goodness somebody wrote it. A fab book about love and loss, finding yourself while your losing yourself. Incredibly moving, it touches your core and brings you to so many realizations. Or least it did for me. I've never read a book that touches so much on the way things are. A masterpeice."
4,Good book,Great summer read. I found myself thinking about the story during the day; it really sucks you in.
2,A very disappointing read.,"The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption, class and race, youth, feminism, yet these remain a shallow, new-age background. When Taylor finally appears to break down under the pressure of young motherhood, it rings false, her switch from bravado to frustration lacks depth and disappears as quickly as Kingsolver's references to the war in Guatamala."
2,A trifle tiresome,"I finished this book because I am persistent. The writing seems to be episodic. The author thinks of the most unlikely thing to have happen and then makes it happen. Although I know this is fiction, I always expect a certain amount of credibility, so why does a young woman who has been employed for several years and who is supposed to be quite intelligent have only enough money saved to buy a car that won't start and leave town for destinations unknown? And how can she arrange an adoption in one afternoon with a sleazy lawyer? I know that this is meant to include single mothers, independent women, helping the great unwashed, the plight of refugees, Native Americans, abandoned children, and domestic abuse, but it seems pasted together and the characters fail to make me care about them."
3,"Cute, but didn't impress me","This is a story of Taylor Greer. Taylor is from a small Kentucky town and is lucky enough to stay in school, get an education, get a job, save some money, leave town and head west. After inheriting a little girl named ""Turtle"" she settles down in Tuscon, Arizona where she gets a job and makes some interesting friends. There was something missing from this book. I am struggling with exactly what. I thought some of the characters, like Lou Ann and Taylor, were developed well enough. Some characters could have been developed more. I thought the story dragged in some parts. I felt like I was missing some key points that should have been mentioned in the book but weren't. Although there was some good humor and some interesting parts that kept my attention, I can't say this book left an impression."
3,"Charming, but not what I typically read","The Bean Trees is a charming little story with quirky characters. It's not typically the type of book I would read, but I did enjoy it overall. It took me a lot longer to read than it usually does for a book this size. For some reason, I could only handle it in small doses. It didn't make me want to run right out and pick up more of Kingsolver's work, but I may give her another try in the future."
3,Not too shabby,"I had to read this book for an English class, and found a pleasant surprise-it's really no that bad. But, it was the equivalent of a ""chick-flick"" for books. All the emotions running rampant throughout the novel sometimes got a little old. If your not into subtle love stories and rather emotional subjects (e.g. motherhood), then I wouldn't recommend it. But, depsite these minor quibbles, I found the story to be somewhat intriguing with the interactions of the characters and the down-to-earth voice of the novel. Kingsolver can grab your attention and keep it with alarming frequency, and often you will have two or three chapters before you even realize how much time has passed. I found following the lives and interactions of the main characters was interesting as well. But, the emotional content of the book wasn't high on my ""must read"" list, even though it was still a good read."
3,Glad it wasn't the first of hers that I read,"Kingslover's first novelGlad it wasn't the first of hers that I readThis didn't do much for me. I found the plot slightly unrealistic; it was lightweight at times but there was clear evidence of the direction her later novels take. The potential is there to be thought provoking, making you assess your viewpoints, but it all remains a little too sweet and bland. (Hmmm ... is that an oxymoron?). The main character vacillated between being feisty and independent and naive and blinkered.The high points are the easy readability, the use of vernacular and the south-west setting. There is no denying the author's ability and it interesting to be able to compare this early novel to my favourites by her (Poisonwood Bible and The Lacuna)"
3,"A well written novel, but too amalgamated.","I'm entering the eleventh grade this September, and this was one of two books I was required to read for my summer reading. ""The Bean Trees"" by Barbara Kingsolver was too confusing at times for me. It was an OK book overall, but there was too much detail, and each chapter was a different story of a different person. For example, in Chapter one, it would be about Taylor and her own plot. Next chapter, it would be about Lou Ann and her own plot. There were basically two different stories in one book. Since there were too many details in each chapter, sometimes I would forget which event happened to which person. If anyone were required to read this as an assignment, I would keep a list of some sort to differentiate between the two ""plots""."
5,Excellent Condition,"The prompt and safe delivery of this book met my expectations. Also, the condition of it exceeded my expectations. I am pleased with my purchase."
1,Size,"The quality was very good, unfortunately I was unhappy with the size it didn't seem to be a xxx-lrg. I have purchased several items of this size and it seems more like it was a x or xx large therefore I now need to take the time and expense of returning it. All in all though it's a nice pullover."
1,turned my hair brassy,This was the wrong choice for me. Great gray coverage but it is darker than expected and made my hair turn brassy. The color is unnatural and I can't wait for it to fade away. Maybe I should have mixed a little bit of this one with a natural ash blonde? as one reviewer suggests..
2,Cute but small and lightweight,I recommend buying a more substantial gnome and just painting a UGA logo on it.
4,Great looking gnome,"My dad loved it (got my mom the florida gator cheerleader gnome to go with it). Detail is nice and the paint job looks good. I forgot to check if it was solid or not but it is hefty for it's size so I'm assuming it's solid until I get to check it out next time we go to my folks. The size is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I knew full well it was only a foot tall when I ordered it so I wasn't shocked when it arrived I just wish they made one that was 18 or 24"" tall so it would be more prominent in the flower bed."
3,"Nice, if you're a UGA fan","We bought this as a gag gift for someone in my husbands family. It actually is quite cute although I'm not sure how well it would hold up outdoors. The person we gave it to loved it and carried it around to his wrestling meets as a good luck charm. When it suffered an untimely death, due to falling out of the car onto the parking lot, we were called to find another one for him to buy. It's a bit smaller than I realized, but overall it was worth the price."
1,Do not buy this book,"""it's a work or art"", yes, it is a work of art, the art of how to write a 1000 pages of nonsenses. Trust me, the author knows very little about network administration.I would give it 0 start if it is an option."
4,great book,"This is a great book for technical investing strategies. However, this edition does not have the questions and answers at the end of the book, which are very useful."
2,Quick read...Entertaining biography with little substance.,"Absolute jibberish....... What a waste.... The author tells me how he he made the money, but never goes into detail about how the process works.... This book was on the Amazon.com hot list, So I bought it.. It is a ""Wall Street Classic"" that consists of a tried and true method of boxing stocks while relying on stop/loss to minimize losses.. The book was written in 1959 or something and $2 million was a lot of cheese back then....I feel like I am no better off after reading this book.... Besides, to follow the plan one must rely on margin calls with no diversity of investments.... Basically this guy ( A dancer by trade) borrows money on margin and puts his eggs in one basket.. His only safety net is the stop/loss......"
4,"How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market","Excellent book. It is a must read for traders & investors. Mr. Darvas discusses many of the pitfalls that spell the demise of new & experienced traders alike, e.g., emotions, lack of money management, complacency, failure to use stop losses, noise (media information overload), lack of planning and sticking to a plan, not developing a custom-made methodology, following advisors, etc. He did not discuss how he would handle shorting stocks. His technique was well-documented & probably works best in a strong, well-established bull market. It also takes bodacious, patient mettle with no deviation from a fastidious, quantitative style. His artistic intuition was a plus. This book is easy, quick reading for the average investor and trader."
3,"Good success story, bad investment guide","This book was interesting to read as a success story, however when it comes to points on how to invest in the stock market - it's almost useless. It seems that the guy was almost lucky to pick the stocks that skyrocketed. He describes the events very carefully, but when it comes to details on HOW he actually picked the stocks he fails to give up the most important information."
2,"Interesting, but poorly explained technique","I found myself rereading several times to try to understand how his ""box theory"" works. The author does an extremely poor job of explaining the most important part of the book as is evident by the questions posed by other readers in the Appendix. He focuses too much on the story and not enough on the technique."
4,Very interesting and useful,"The author described his own trading experience. But I think this one is a book about trading psychology. It shows the readers how a person growing from a novice to a successful trader. Many people made the same mistakes as the author did. Sometimes we did so but we didn't know it until it was too late. After reading it, I am quite sure I wouldn't fall in the same traps again. This could be money saving. I really enjoy this book!"
3,Interesting story,Just one of many ways you can make money in the stock market. Not a great story but an interesting read.
1,Wake up.,People tend to forget that such books as this (O Neil etc) were written in a bull market. This approach is utterly pointless now.Just look at a graph of the dow and realise this book is a waste of your money.
2,Nothing to do with modern investing,"This book is a fairy tale that does not teach you anything about how the current financial markets operate and how to trade and invest money. Try Toby Crabel's book or articles which are hard to find, but presents the best approach to trading the current markets. He is a professional money manager and trader, while the author of this book is a jazz dancer.Why not give your money to an actor from Hollywood for that matter?"
4,Great book,Thought it was a well written book.Fairly short but insightful.Gives you a different perspective on trading the markets and explains how to keep your emetion and ego in check.
5,Entertaining,I rated this 5 stars for it's true readings. The story just shows you that even when you think you're doing the best possible thing in the stock market it can turn against you.
2,Not worth the time.,"This book is boring- repeating the same experiences that didn't work with all the details on every one. What's good about it (there is some) is of limited value in today's marketplace, and you have to sort it out of all the filler. Overall, if you are trying to learn how to invest wisely- it provides more confusion that it clears up, and thus is a waste of time.I've been managing my own investments for 7 years, and typically make about 20% annual. Neither novice nor expert, I read to learn more.. but like stocks- some books sound a lot better than they are. I can't see this book as being of much value at any experience level."
3,Of historical interest...,An amusing little read - - but buy O'Neil's book on how to make money in the stock market if you really want to get into the detail.
2,Reads like fiction,"The only useful technique of his that can be used in today's market is his box technique; A.K.A support and resistance lines. If you know about them (and quite frankly what new trader doesn't) then this book is a waste of time unless you want to read something that isn't going to tax your brain.The reason I gave it two stars is this book turned out to be a break for me from reading a lot of rather intensely technical books, and I was able to tackle the next book on my list feeling a bit refreshed without having lost my rhythm for reading stock trading books.Things have changed since the 1950's. There is so much irrelevance in this book for today's market, and that which is relevant is available to learn in almost any other book written this century.If you spot this at a garage sale then spend the 10 cents to satisfy your curiosity, otherwise don't waste your time if you are more interested in learning something useful from a book."
1,Save Your Money .. it's merely buying on Break-out,"In 1957 to 1958, the Dow Jones Industrial went up 60%. Darvas stocks went up 400%. If you have the knack to pick up those stocks in a bull market, good for you, otherwise really be CAUTIOUS when trying out this system.Simple system:1. Buy on breakout2. Stops placed are subjective (based on how he felt the strength of the market is)3. Use Trailing stop-losses4. Stocks selected should be in a 'future' industry eg GM, Chrysler during that time as opposed to railway stocks (though I don't believe this is strictly adhered to in his stock picks)Also, the stocks you pick must not have a tendency to retrace when they are moving up, otherwise I'm pretty positive your trailing stop-losses will be hit 90% of the time and won't let your profits run as much.I'm highly skeptical and I've been in the market for 15 years"
3,Worth Reading,"I would say the 'box' theory in this book may be new at the time it published, but it is really the very basic support and resistence concept that we should all know a few months into trading seriously.It is a good read about the author's path from amateur to a knowledgeble trader, with a system of his own after many expensive lessons. The path would sound familar to most of us.I learnt from this book not so much in whether the 'box' system will work or not, but confirming again that without a system that you trusted and tested will be like drifting in a wide ocean with rumurs and news.I will not take the box system as my system, but I am thinking of shuting many channels of news and information, which are mostly noises. Some very fundamental business condition news and basic chartings may just do the job."
5,Inspirational,"The evolution of the little trader from clueless to breakeven to profitable. A must read for educational and inspirational purposes. His box breakout can be interpreted in many ways which will force you to think about it, though his true edge is reglious use of stops and hanging on to winners."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is an autobiography of Nicolas Darvas' life. There is nothing describing in clear detail the system he used and how he used it. Nicholas gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it magically shot up in price overnight and was restricted from anymore trading. He sold one stock that magically shot up for 171 dollars a share, profit 250,000. I don't even think the results he posted were real. The most information you gain from this book is to buy stocks in a strong uptrend and that info is nothing new."
4,This is a timeless proven technique that has worked for many,"THIS BOOK IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE:1) novice traders2) traders that follow advises, tips and various ""professional advisers"".3) new traders trying to scalp markets without giving too much thought to itTHIS BOOK IS NOT:1) a get rich quick scheme. Discipline and hard work what made him successful.2) it is not a high tech analysis book, so don't expect to find charts and patterns. it's more about basic psychology of the market and money management as well as basic yet effective and proven breakout patterns that everyone should study.Simplicity is the key here, and I appreciate people who advocate the most simplistic approach to the markets."
3,can be useful,"I read this book and it was interesting. It is very much like Jesse livermores' approach of only buying on price increases. The approach is the same. I suggest that anyone who gets this book also get ""jesse Livermore, worlds' greatest stock trader"" by richard smitten and read that too."
4,Everyone who trades stocks should read this book....,"This is the only book I have ever read that details the author's personal journey through stock trading. Yes, he doesn't spell out his system in an easy to understand fashion (in fact, I've spend many hours rereading and condensing his approach into something I could understand) but the book is a great read and his system makes perfect sense even today. Forget technical analysis -- life is too short; just read this book for a quick, lively course in momentum investing."
3,Disappointing book but interesting read,"For those looking to find out the exact methods Nicolas Darvas used to obtain his $2 million, you will be disappointed. The title is what it is and a little misleading. The ""How"" part is more a play on words on what stock issues he traded and more of the faith he had in himself to hold onto his stocks. Basically Darvas looked for volume spikes and then sought strong fundamentals in stocks. His approach wasn't revolutionary other than trading ranges and buying breakouts.It is an entertaining read no doubt but will leave experienced traders asking for more."
3,Not that impressed,If your buying this book to learn how to buy stocks save your money. Nicolas Darvas isn't all that clear on his strategy and there are better books out there on the subject. On the other hand its a nice quick read if you like to read true success stories.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Unfortunately, the title of this book never happened. At least that was the conclusion of the New York State Attorney General, Louis Lefkowitz. A write-up of the allegations against Darvas can be found at[...]Aside from outright misrepresentation of gains actually made, Darvas excluded his trades that resulted in losses and omitted the fact that much of his investments were made with the proceeds of margin loans.While it is clear that Darvas did not make $2 million in the stock market, it is entirely possible that he made a comparable sum selling books to benighted people who actually believed that some benevolent individual who discovered the secret to attaining fantastic wealth in the stock market would be happy to share it with the whole world."
4,Excellent,"Even though Mr. Darvas made these stock transactions about 45 years ago, many aspects of his system are still in effect today. I purchased this book because it was recommended by Gary Kaultbaum, a well-known stock market expert. It is a very good book and a quick read."
2,"But he never made 2,000,000 from the market","Darvas never did actually make 2,000,000 trading, was sued and barred from trading. The ideas seem solid but if you look up the actual records it was about 200,000 USD. Just to keep in mind there is no better trader than one who thinks for themselves. Study the market, learn the market, hunt it, stalk it, take home your game. Now who wants to know the truth about Gann?"
1,Buyer Beware,"For some reason, Amazon keeps deleting my review but here it goes again.I personally found the book interesting when I first read it (particularly the box theory on triggering stock purchases and sales). However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Darvas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book."
2,Entertaining but not enough details,"I got this book based on so many 5-star reviews posted here. This book is indeed entertaining for leisure reading. However, it lacks the much more practical details in explaning what the techo-fundamental method he used is all about. The book did provide some basic advice on implementing stop-loss, limit buy, etc, to limit the risk. However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading 101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks. This book is good if you are looking for a non-textbook leisure reading. If you are looking for trading methods (either technical or fundamental) that can help you to be better in trading, I think the ""Mastering the Trade"" by John Carter is by far the most practical book that I found in the market."
3,Motivation,If you want to be motivated or if the market is down and discouraging you. This book will inspire you to get back in the world of trading and teach you basic trading techniques that are still applicable today.
4,Liked it but it lacks something,"I enjoyed the system derived purely from his experience. My only disappointment was the lack of explanation of Darvas boxes and how they were used. I think the book will be beneficial to anyone who reads it and realizes that Darvas' success happened in spite of, maybe because of, all the positions in which he lost money."
3,"More like a pamphlet than a book, but still good...","Kind of antiquated now, but still a good story. The author tells the story of how he made a fortune in the markets - $2 million in his time is probably more like $10-$15 million now. He started by investing based on tips, then on fundamentals, and finally by combining technicals and fundamentals. It's educational and very readable. The amazing thing is how little Wall Street and the investing world have changed since Darvas made his fortune in the 50s."
1,Quite useless,"...the guy tells the story of how he made lots of money in the markets. No specifics and the methods he outlines are kind of loony. Interesting to read if you have some time to waste or like these kinds of ""I made millions! Millions I tell you!"" stories. Don't expect to read this and then go out and make your 2 million."
1,RickR,The previous reviewers of this book must have been on drugs when they wrote them. All this book talks about is the mistakes he made which lost him money. He doesn't demonstrate any clear methodology as to how to invest and make money like the title suggests. This book is a TOTAL waste of money and time. You will be better served by going to a local book store and selecting a book yourself.
2,hope for the stupid,"This book illustrates that if someone as stupid as Nicholas Darvas can make money in the stock market so can you.After all, it took this guy several years after he began trading to figure out what the Dow Jones Industrial Average was.Essentially, Darvas used fundamental analysis in conjunction with""stocks that were moving"" and placed trailing stops behind them. Darvas never shorts a stock. The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain.Not a bad system. It supposedly worked for him.In my opinion,their are a few, and only a few, good ideas which can be gleaned from this essentially worthless book."
3,Think about it...,"I just thought of something... Even if the theories described here were correct at the time, the mere fact that a number of people started to follow the approach would affect the stocks' behaviour and the theory would no longer be correct."
3,"don't think of it as a ""black-box"" system","This book is one of the stock-market classics of all-times!However, if you think it will give you a system that you can copy and paste and then run on a computer you are very very wrong!I do not know if Darvas results were real..But if they were..they worked during a bull market. It's a little bit harder to trade using his approach in a downward market, but it is not impossible. I read his second book, and according to it after several years had passed after 1960 his account was still around 2.4-2.6 mln which is not a big annualized percentage increase.The approach is still valid today. It's called trend-following."
1,False advertising - avoid,"Amazon claims ""training DVD to teach you all the features & functions & HOW TO USE & MAXIMIZE your Garmin unit"". What can I tell you? There are many many features and functions that are not mentioned at all. I have told Amazon to modify this claim and of course I am retuning it to them."
3,"medium story, not much delivery","This is a lesbian movie made for straight people. It doesn't cross any lines that will make them uncomfortable. It's slow paced, like many British movies. A mother comes to be friends with a teacher when the teacher shows an interest in the son's artistic ability. Things start slowly and remain slow. The women come to realize they have feelings for each other and decide what they want to do. As to interaction between the characters, they could have been deciding to be best friends. The movie was OK, but I kept getting distracted by emails and other things. It just didn't hold my attention."
5,This Is A Bomb ...Anime!!,"i first seen this anime on cartoon network. i knew i had to get this series but, i also knew i had to get it uncut. to tell you the truth i didn't buy this anime from here i bought it some where esle cause i knew i was going to be uncut.This is one of the best anime's i have ever seen. if your new to anime you should definitly cop this one and when you do you will love anime and want to but more, belive me on that one. or if you one of those pepole who love action with humor in it. then this anime is definitly for you. there's one episode called(hot springs on planet tenri) that has a lot of humor and sex humor in it(but nothing bad). i wacth that episode a lot it is so funny. but you really need to buy this series, trust me you will not regret it. it is worth ever pretty penny:)"
5,"We like ninjas, Japan likes cowboys",".............. drum roll.... and SUNRISE wins again. This collection of DVDS is one of the greatest I've ever seen. Everything blends perfectly, including the music, which many said was not up to par. This set follows the classic practice of the American love of ninjas, honor, nobility and such things with the Japanese sweet tooth for cowboys and lone wolves. Captivating, wonderful, angering and sad all at the same time. It never reaches a level of confusion or overdoes the cowboy half like you often see in this genre of anime, such as often happens in shows like Cowboy Beebop, and others. Good for all, maybe 12 and up."
3,A good steeping stone into the World of Anime,"Outlaw Star is a decent anime. I have seen worse, much worse. The animation isn't breathtaking, but it doesn't impede with the storytelling. The last few episodes are rushed badly. Too much was crammed into the last two episodes. Other than those two, the series runs smoothly, slightly slow at times. The characters are funny, the voice actors are great in English, but Jim's Japanese voice is very annoying.So for an overview: animation=decent, voices=very good, plot=very good, characters (minus Melfina)=great, overall=very good. It is definately not the best anime out there, but it's a nice series."
1,The series is great...however buy at your own risk,One of my discs (box 3 disc 1) is completely unplayable on all three of my dvd players. Its been a month since I bought it so I had already threw my receipts away which was really stupid of me considering only a few months ago I bought Jin-Roh (another quality Bandai product) which didn't work either. The series is great though however if you purchase it I highly recommend you check all episodes ASAP to make sure you have a product that works.
5,Hokey smokes Bullwinkle!!,"FINALLY! I found it here on Amazon by accident but Outlaw Star is mine! You otaku out there get ahold of this series, cuz if you remember it from Adult Swim on Cartoon Network there's an episode that either wasn't aired on TV, or that I missed... and HUBBA HUBBA! It's not fit for kiddies!"
4,the star collection,"i loved the outlaw star anime ever since it came out on toonami. and when i found the box set, i was really happy. the set includes the original three volumes, which contain 9 episodes each and a cool black box which holds all three. the only reason that i gave it a 4 star rating is because i think the box is not sturdy enough and it didnt come wit a poster or any other special extras. overall a good anime and i would reccomend this for purchase."
5,A Fun Anime Series,"I bought this series remembering it from the Toonami block, and because I couldn't find a legit set of Cowboy Bebop. Outlaw Star, however, is just about as good. It details the exploits of Gene Starwind and his motley crew while being chased by space pirates, trying to make a living, and trying to find the Galactic Leyline. Plenty of action and the chemistry between Gene and Jim is great. My only complaint was Aisha Clan-Clan. She was annoying."
5,Great fun to watch!,"Got this boxed set for my birthday and after watching the entire series, I felt relieved. I remember when it was airing on Toonami and how popular and cool the show was back then. It brought back many memories. The banter bewtween Jim and Gene is hilarious and the subtle romance between Gene and Melfina was just enough to keep the show intriguing. Not to say, the Outlaw Star, the ship itself wasn't cool enough or the battles too. It was a very interesting story to follow and I really enjoyed reliving the series again. Highly recommended."
5,Sci-Fi/Fantasy tour de force,"The Outlaw Star series is some of the best material in the Sci-Fi genre, anime or live-action. It combines a string of bewilderingly imaginative elements with a compelling, mysterious storyline and an amazing cast of characters. A pirate myth for the space age, Outlaw Star places viewers in a world so expansive and adventure-filled it resonates with the various colonial histories of our world. This anime will remind you of what youth and freedom really are, and make you wonder if you have ever tasted them. It showcases all the best elements of popular anime: humor, action, imagination, and all-around human experience. A great score and nice special features make this an attractive package for all of us anime junkies who hate the profusion of mediocre material on the market right now. I'm so addicted I keep dreaming of a follow up. Highly recommended"
3,"A good anime, but shallow story.","The story is about a man with red hair (the only one in the series with this hair color) flying his ship known as the Outlaw star around the Milky Way. Looking for something known as the lay line..... That is about it. With very little character development other then a couple main people, I personally found myself drifting away from the story and focusing on the action. There were a few select moments where I did find myself drawn to the story but they were so few and so fast that it never lasted for more then a couple seconds. I do recommend this but just letting you know that I feel it might not live up to your expectations."
2,Average at best. Don't believe the hype of the other reviews.,"This show is not for true anime lovers. It's basically an American Saturday morning cartoon with crude jokes and nudity. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. The main character Gene Starwind is cool, Caster Gun and all, and the concept is original, but that's where it stops.There is absolutely no depth, each and every supporting character is lame and under developed, nothing is explained, the episodes leave you wanting so much more, and the ending is a total let down. It's got sub par action and a hand full of pretty good action scenes but nothing more.Don't compare this to the likes of Trigun or Cowboy Bebop, especially the latter. Outlaw Star is simply okay, B-/C+, nothing more. Watch your friend's dvds before you buy this first."
2,For Grown Ups or Kids?,"I originally watched Outlaw Star when it was on Cartoon Network, and thought it was one of the best anime's I had ever seen.How disapointed I was when I ordered and actually started to watch it.Outlaw Star is another tragic example of people trying to mix a very simple and almost childish atmosphere with mature themes and language. Which in short means that the storyline and the dialog my attract the attention of younger people who shouldn't be exposed to the language and the nudity that is in the cartoon, while more mature audiences may feel almost embaressed to be watching something so simple.Baisically, it's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon with foul language and sex. It's a very poor mix.Except for their dialog, the characters are great. the storyline, although sometimes predictable and simple eventually picks up, and by the end, you truly want to know what the Galactic Layline is, if you can get that far in the series."
3,it's just ok,"Gene Starwind, an outlaw in space, a century and a half after humans developed faster-than-light spacecraft. (Note that an ""outlaw"" in the show's context is simply an independent person with no major governmental loyalties, as opposed to a criminal.)Gene alone with a 12-year old business associate and hacker Jim Hawking runs a small jack-of-all-trades business on the backwater planet Sential III."
3,Solid 70's rock,"This the band where John Bonham and Robert Plant were seen by Terry Reid and referred to Jimmy Page.This does not contain Plant and Bonham.This is decent, even very good 70's cock rock, histrionic singer, dumb lyrics, and plenty of power chords."
3,"100 Words on ""Vampires - Los Muertos""","""Vampires: Los Muertos"", a sequel to John Carpenter's 1998 hit ""Vampires"", is one more fine film in the Jon Bon Jovi canon. This time around, Jon plays a vampire slayer who has his hands full saving the world deep in the heart of Mexico. While it re-uses many of the elements from the first movie, and borrows one major plot point from Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"", the script has enough going for it to be an enjoyable way to waste an hour and a half. And, of course, Jon shows that his two years of acting classes paid off."
1,Ugh,"I feel that this is one of those films that I feel is a part of the contemporary polarization. Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines. It's one extreme or the other. No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious. Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that.This was low budget, over-stuffed with action and bad special effects and ultimately disappointing."
3,Vampires - Los Muertos,"If you like Vampires and John Bon Jovi, you will like this. Never make top 10, but enjoyed it."
3,Los Muertos,I actually liked this movie. The lady vampire was good. I liked Natasha Wagner's part in it. A little too much fake blood but a pretty good story. I'm from the days of the Hammer Studios and they made revolutionary horror movies for their time. The book for John Carpenter's vampires was better but both movies were entertaining!
2,Lame,"A more or less sequel to John Carpenter's smashing take on vampires, Vampires: Los Muertos finds Carpenter's long time collaborator Tommy Lee Wallace (Halloween 3) directing this low budget direct to video shlock fest, starring Jon Bon Jovi of all people as a vampire hunter in over his head. Assembling a haphazard, rag tag team (including Lost Highway's Natasha Wagner) to combat a vampire queen (Arly Jover, who played a vamp in the original Blade, and she looks much better here), the film rolls briskly along with some over the top overacting, plenty of leaps in logic, and plot holes aplenty. It's a shame John Carpenter's name got attached to this drek of a horror film, those who enjoyed his Vampires should definitely avoid."
4,Better Then Vampires,"This is one of the only times I can actually say the sequel is better then the original. Although James Woods is a cool bad [...] on film it seemed that Jon Bon Jovi just played this part better. Bon Jovi had a more lack-a-daysical and loner type attitude toward the whole business of vampire hunting. In this movie there is also a little bit more to the plot then the orignal, although it does have drawing power from the original. All the actors did a good job and I'm not even sure I would call this a B-Movie, you just don't get that cheesy feeling when you watch it. If you're a fan of ""Vampires"" or the genre I would definately buy this movie."
2,Tame Vampire Fare,"This is a sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires, a minor hit that saw director Carpenter return to form and break the cliches of vampire films. This is not bad and not good either, as they changed the whole film from its initial release. It did have a lot of nudity and gore and was kind of suspenseful, but this sequel just serves to put yet another American vampire film on the shelves. Check out the 1998 original Vampires by John Carpenter to get a good look at breaking the cliches."
2,Definitely not Carpenter's best..,"Definately not one of Carpenter's (who I am not a huge fan of anyway) best; it was written very lazily & directed (and acted) badly. Maybe it was the stupid/lame title, or maybe the boring plot. Either way, I didn't take much with me except the setting...and Bon Jovi & Diego Luna's prettiness. You know a movie isn't all that good when all that stands out are the looks of the main characters!"
3,Vampires: Los Muertos,"A movie doesn't get much more average than this, I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, it was just ok. It's basically the same as the first movie, which I enjoyed, but just not done as well. You have the second string of actors, who really aren't likeable, they just have no personality and all feel very wooden. If you saw John Carpenter's Vampires, then you've already seen this movie, you've just seen it done better."
3,"Typical B Movie, Nothing More","The movie is good until the last 20 minutes. The problem is the main vampire is supposed to strong and powerful, but it comes to Bon Jovi and his pack of hunters its seems them powers are gone. Also the main vampire is pretty stupid as she falls for there tricks, as when Bon Jovi says ""come out I want to talk to you."" OK, Even when The vampire kid naps the priest, that whole part was stupid to.Another problem with the movie is you don't know anything about the main vampire's character. Where did she come from? How etc. This is just a typical movie, there isn't no depth in the storyline and it has your typical B Movie ending, we're chasing some powerful vampire, which can't hurt us and everything goes our way, the end. The first one was better."
2,This is a Vampire movie?,"Jon Bon Jovi. Ok that sums up reasons to watch this movie. Now onto every reason not to...it doesn't follow hardly anything I've ever known about Vampires, it lacks action in a major way, it is slow moving...or maybe it just seems that way because you have to force yourself to stay awake through it. If you are a die hard Jon Bon Jovi fan, like myself, buy it, he looks great. If you want a good vampire more go get ""Interview with the Vampire"", ""Queen of the Damned"", or ""Blade"" and ""Blade 2"", those are vampire movies worth watching."
3,Really 3.5 but could be better,"This was a surprise for me as I didn't think Jon BonJovi could follow up James Woods performance. I was wrong and that was why it took so long for me to watch this! True BonJovi is no James Woods granted. This really is a decent film. The action was good and had OK special effects. But don't go into this movie with the high standards of James Woods and John Carpenter (even if he did produce the film) fogging your vision. Enjoy it as a seperate entry to the 'series'.As for previous reviews on this and the many other video's here on Amazon, there will be both good and bad ones and that is great. This forum provides a place where people who have not seen the film can make their own opinions and make a decision based upon what they read. However, when some people start trashing the film without even seeing it, they need to grow up and look at what they review before opening up their pieholes.Thanks for reading my review! :)"
4,I like it.,"It's kind of cheesy at times but I adore Diego Luna, so I had to buy it. I have watched it several times and if you like vampire movies, you should see it at least once."
3,Lost in Mexico,"What to say about this movie. As a story line, I really liked what the intention of the movie was about. As the actual movie, I felt there was just a bit too much time spent getting Bon Jovi's crew together and not on really developing the story like it was done in the first movie. In the first movie, we got the chance to know the history behind the vampire and what he was after. This one seemed touched lightly on the topic, and from that point on it was like you were expected to guess what was going on, rather than developing it fully. There were some pretty silly mistakes made too that just seemed unrealistic for their part in the movie.Still, if you can follow along and see through all of Bon Jovi's head shots and the skipping around to find the real story as it develops, its not a bad flick."
2,"sort of boring, difficult to follow",A vampire movie is good if it does one of two things: makes you think OR makes you a bit scared. This movie didn't do either for me. Maybe I just have difficulty by Bon Jovi as a vampir hunter but I think ultimately not enough time is spent on telling us and helping us feel why these hunters do what they do and why the vampires do what they do.
2,go back to hell,"i have never seen such a pointless movie. i mean what the hell were they thinking. the script was bad, no bad is an under statement, horrible script and even worse actors. the only good part of the is the lead vampire, i would have gave this movie 5 stars if she would have just ripped her shirt off like expected in every other horror movie but no they go and screw it up like everything else. and oh yeah the end was good to."
2,Lame duck,"The reason I bought this movie is first the title and second I like Bon Jovi. I will buy anything with vampires and thought it would be interesting to see Bon Jovi in a horror movie. I was wrong the two do not go together. Silly premise, silly ending and less than stellar acting. If you are looking to be frightened, then this is not for you. If you like anything Vampires with Bon Jovi thrown in, you might want to keep this for your amusement."
1,Dont quit your day job...,"Dont waste the money on this stinker. Jon, stick to your day job of rocking teenage girls and middle-aged housewives. This is supposedly some sort of sequal to Carpenter's ""Vampires"" which totally rocked, Los Muertes is nowhere near being in the same league. Obviously an excuse for Bon Jovi's female fans to see Jon with his shirt off unfortunatly guys there are no gratutious female bod-shots for us to make this movie worth-while. Forget the fact that the plot jumps around so much that you give up trying to understand it and just pray that it somehow gets better before you fall asleep. Take some advice and rent it like I did. Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind."
4,Just a comment about others,"I would just like to mention that none of the reviews here are talking about the 4th edition, which came out in 2002. While a new edition isn't a completely different book, according to the publisher, there are some significant changes that have been made to the book.I used the 2nd edition in my Freshman year of High School and I really like how the book was made, laid out, and how the information was presented. The diagrams are a big aid in the presentation and instruction of the material."
1,"Overall, thorough but dense book","I used this for high school freshman introductory biology, and boy! The writing is dense and excessively formal, and some concepts weren't explained very well. It's a gorgeous book, though, with beautiful color photos and computer diagrams, and it's chock-full of bios and anecdotes. Buy it was a coffee-table book, not as a simple biology text for regular high school kids. (The test questions, which my teacher used from the cd test bank, were devastating. You wouldn't believe the nitpicky details they asked you)"
4,A high standard text for Diploma level or Undergraduates,"I own the International Edition of this book, ISBN 0-321-10679-2.I would NOT recommend this book to secondary school students, unless they were of exceptional ability, and nor would I suggest it for students seeking very detailed explanations of any particular topic.Rather, I found this book (apart from being the set text for one of my papers) to be very good at presenting a good overview of the many areas encompassed by the term 'Biology.' The ""Concepts and Connections"" theme is really very good, providing insights into real life scenarios. Excellent graphics and superb photographs help to give life and depth to the subject matter.Initial preparatory sections on chemistry for biologists proved very helpful, with indispensible glossary and thorough index at the back.If you're studying Diploma level Biology, or a more general undergraduate Biology paper, then this book could be for you."
3,Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldSB,I thought this book was pretty good because he was supposed to do his chores but he did'nt and did not do the dishes and Hidya had to.And he made a mess in the kitchen and his mother had to clean it up.
3,Believe in yourself!,Justin and the best biscuits in the world is about a little boy named Justin. Justin is not very tidy at all. When his grandpa comes to stay Justin gets to go back with his grandpa who lives on a ranch. When he believes in him self and tries he did all the stuff he could not do before.
4,"Read along with your kids and talk, talk, talk","My son read this book with his 4th grade class. I read it along and out loud with him because we are really working on reading comprehension.This is a terrific discussion-starter book for parents and children. Not only is there the sexism parts, but there is also the theme of Justin being never shown how to do things (or made fun of when he tries) to the extent that he just stopped trying.I was very surprised to see the ""n-word"" (it's on page 82 in mine) in a book geared toward such young children. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I would not have known about it if I had not been reading the book with my son. They did not discuss it in school or let the parents know which is a shame, as it led to a few great discussions in our home about racism and the power of words.Overall, a great book. It was nice to see some diversity in my son's required reading and to have a completely boy-centric book where the main character is not sickeningly perfect."
4,Touching story,"I borrowed the book from the library, because my children like biscuits. The book surprised me with its story line. It is so beautiful about a boy becoming man of responsibility and knowing his african american history. A few times the story did not flow too well. Therefore I gave it a four star review."
2,At least it's short.,"Justin is a whiny, lazy, sexist kid who is miraculously transformed by a trip to his grandpa's. There were some interesting references in this book, but it just wasn't believable. The title was boring and so was the plot. It did make me curious about Black cowboys, but that wasn't enough to keep my attention."
2,Old Info - Not useful,"Forget this book if you want good working examples. In nearly every chapter the author displays MFC class code but no examples for use of the technologies he is talking about. Also, if you are trying to learn how to write a multi-threaded TCP based server, you can foreget this book. Like others have stated, this book is old. Published in 1996 it refers Windows 95 and NT 4.0 as new technologies."
4,Good Introduction,"""Philosophy 1"" is a good introductory survey text. While it is somewhat more technical than what the casual reader may want, my goal was to learn something about ""real philosophy, not simplified philosophy."" The book hit the mark on this account.I was drawn to the text because of another (popular) book by A. C. Grayling. Each chapter of the text, however, is written by a different author. Consequently, the chapters vary in style and, to some extent, quality. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on methodology, the rationalists, the empiricists (by A. C. Grayling), and aesthetics.It took some effort for this casual reader to get through the text, but it was well worth it."
2,Dissapointing. . .,"People Get Ready and Electric Sweat were great examples of a great roots-rock sound that was familiar yet still was original in its own right. This record is cheesy; plain and simple. For those of you who enjoy it, I invite you to listen to the aforementioned albums afterwards to truly understand why this band WAS truly something special."
5,WOW,this is an awesome story of what love can do. you will be amazed and will probably cry. thank God for people like Mama Heidi!
5,Found at Best Buy,I found this product at BUST BUY on the 2nd.You don't have to wait for the 21 release date on here.
2,what the deal amazon,i just bought this movie last week at bestbuy.i also bought the judas priest cd at walmart last week.why are you guys fallen behind on your movies
2,"great music, bad video","If you like the music of Pablo Montero, only buy this if you are a collector, it only has 6 songs, very bad extras and the videos seem to be very bad TV grabbing, lousy video quality. Not worthy of Pablo Montero. Looks like the music company who gave permission to publish this really does not care about a basic standard of quality"
1,idiot publishers at DC made vol 4 and 5 the SAME!,So I bought Gotham Central Vol.4 from Amazon hardcover and vol.5 paperback at the same time. I read vol.4 over the course of a month or so and got to vol.5 only to realize that it was the exact same book! DO NOT BUY vol.5 if you have vol.4! Vol.5 is the dead robin story which is in vol.4 and also includes the corrigan story as well. PEACE
2,Gotham Central Vol.1 (The Jokes on us),"Take any cop show and try and find an episode that was to bland to be aired on TV so they put it in as an extra in a box set and labeled it ""never before seen episode"" and you have Gotham Central. I've been reading graphic novels for 30 years and I received this book as a gift. I thought the concept was a great idea and I couldn't wait to open it up. I was incredibly disappointed. I kept reading, hoping the stories would produce some meat, anything at all! But it was second rate cop show bland. All they had to do was take one of the many great Batman stories and write about it from the police departments point of view. I can't imagine the people that wrote positive reviews actually read it."
2,Gotham City Gloom,"This book does not live up to the reviews others are giving it. Of course anything tied to Gotham City will feature Batman, but, in this case, only in cameo shots (perhaps the writers were too embarassed to feature him more). This is supposed to be a ""behind the scenes"" kind of effort wherein the ""real"" heroes of Gotham City are its dedicated police officers. I cannot honestly see any point in serving up these stories. They are really very poorly written for coming from Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka; actually pretty hackneyed which would give credence to one reviewer's saying it recalled the good old days - the language seems right out of an incredibly bad Mickey Spillane pulp novel. The whole Mr. Freeze arc starts off good, but fizzles out very badly. Maybe this was better at some point as the editing seems very choppy. The art was good, but the story should be the driving force and it lacks any real suspense or drama. Look elsewhere for better (way better) stories by these writers."
5,Hill Street Blues in Gotham City,"With Batman lurking on the fringes, Gotham Central is a darker Hill Street Blues, focusing on the rough-edged men and women of the Gotham City Police Department Major Crimes Unit who resent Batman's presence while often coming face to face with members of his gallery of rogues. This collection of the first 5 issues of the series features a brutal appearance by Mister Freeze (nothing like the abomination played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the resolution of two seemingly unconnected cases without Batman's help.Michael Lark's gritty and atmospheric art are a perfect complement to Brubaker and Rucka's taut plots and precise characters, making Gotham Central one of the most compelling comics currently being published."
3,jazz blast from the past,"the late jorge dalto's last studio album,""listen up""has at last seen re-release.Playing with a stellar cast of '80s superstar sidemen,dalto sambas his way through several of his own compositions,as well as a few works by other composers.notable on this album are""Samba all day long""and Dalto's swinging take on""spanish Harlem""Well worth the price of admission!"
4,Good book for beginners,The book explained the basics of SQL Server and was helpful for a beginner like me. It helped me get started quickly with SQL Server 7.0
1,Not quite up to snuff...,"As a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer I can't say I liked this book at all. Not because it was too basic or anything like that, but because the style of writing was extremely difficult to follow. Almost every page I read had major grammatical mistakes that made following what the author said to be very difficult. I get the impression that this book was rushed into print without proper proof-reading and without a knowledgeable person reviewing the contents to make sure a person unfamiliar with the subject could understand it."
3,Good for beginners,"I was hoping for a robust book. If you want to learn about MS SQL 7, this is a good beginner book. However, for more meat, I also got SQL Server 7.0 DBA Survival Guide. I found that book more useful."
2,Why must producers insult great literary works?,"The Revengers Tragedy is one of the worst modern adaptations I have ever seen in my entire life! I cannot believe that someone would sit down and distinctly consider to even re-write such a script. I honestly believe that Thomas Middleton's literary work has been trashed through this overdone, lack of follow through and just down right horrific costuming and acting. I highly recommend that no one rents this dvd. What a disgrace to such a fine and intense play."
1,Absolute garbage--zero stars,"Any sense of story is completely lost in this blood and gore fest. I understand that the director is attemping to comment on the random violence of our world. Is that something new? ""Bonnie and Clyde"" did that over 30 years ago.I also understand that we're supposed to be jarred by the post-nuclear images of London and the freaks who haunt the underground. I so wanted to scream ""Shut up!!!"" Oh, and yes, we get the part about the beautiful member of nobility who dies under such cruel circumstances. Diana did nothing to deserve this treatment.Really, I would expect more of Derek Jacobi and even Eddy Izzard.This movie became irrelevant the day before it was released."
4,Strange and wonderful,"Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include ""nudity."" There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical."
2,Okay product.,"This is the first OPI product I tried and it looks nice on, but you have to put on several coats to make a glossy finish. My nails have high vertical ridges and I wanted to smooth them out. If too many coats of filler are on, the filler chips early on. OPI is supposed to last longer than other polishes, but not the case."
4,good soup,"I ordered a case of 12 soups, and six if them were dented. I got a refund so Im OK with it, but it was disappointing. The soup itself is quite good if you add some stuff to it like dill, a little salt and pepper."
3,"Weird, nonetheless pleasant, but ultimately meh","Anders Jormin's album IN WINDS, IN LIGHT is an odd duck. It features the curious instrumentation of bass (Jormin), piano (Marilyn Crispell), organ (Karin Nelson) and percussion (Raymond Strid). In the foreground of these musicians is vocalist Lena Willemark, whose singing ranges from Lutheran hymnody to shrieks and yelps derived either from Swedish folk traditions or the 20th century avant-garde. Willemark sings mostly in Swedish, but a couple of tracks are in English. The organ is omnipresent, but Jormin, Strid and Crispell often sit out. The music is consistently sparse and downtempo.There's no doubt that the performers here are talented, but the music doesn't add up to much. In exploring ECM's output, I find so much of this European jazz is pretty but inconsequential. I don't mind sitting through this disc, but I'd have a hard time recommending it to anyone."
4,Night sky,"Se tu mi scordi... Lena, Lena! Richiamo nel bosco. Lena, dove sei andata? Lena, mi senti? Una voce risuona lontana, limpida come un ruscello di montagna. ""La luna de cristal / la rama roja / del lento otono en mi ventana / si toco / junto al fuego / la impalpable ceniza / o el arrugado cuerpo de la lena / todo me lleva a ti"". La melodia fugge dalla finestra, verso gli alberi, verso la voce di Lena Willemark. Come in una vecchia poesia di Neruda, s'incontrano tra i rami. La voce diventa natura, le legna è corpo di donna. La notte, sotto la pioggia, sembra stellata."
4,very good documentary,"If you're a John Waters fan you will probably enjoy this documentary quite a bit. It has lots of facts about some of the earlier films he did, interviews with Waters and cast members, including the irreplacable Divine, clips and outtakes. I wanted even more but this was great. Besides that the documentary is excellently compiled. The director obviously has a true love for the work of John Waters and his art as well as the unique characters he incorporated into his work."
3,"Du Bois, Biography of a Race","I found this book moved very slow, I had to keep stopping in reading it for a few days, just because I found I would lose intrest.stepaheda"
2,It was really boring,"I read this book to suppliment a biographical sketch I was doing on DuBois. This was although one of the most helpful, one of the dryest and most boring books I've ever read. If your going to read this, make sure it's totally of your own free will."
3,The whole story,"The one problem I had with this book was the fact that not only was it OLD, but it covers only NT V3.5, not even a mention of NT4. I was not interested in DOS or W95The info was ok quality-wise, but not anywhere NEAR current.I put it on the shelf after a quick perusal."
3,A good walkthrough.,"Among the various types of Technical books, I would term this one a 'walkthrough'. Rather than approach the subject in an organized theoretical fashion (like his other book, Windows Nt Tcp/Ip Network Administration), the author leads you step by step through using TCP/IP in a variety of platforms, incl. DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and NT.The author doesn't hand hold you through the process. (This is not a book with full-page screen prints and 14pt font text.) If you are good at configuring PCs and/or have some experience either using or setting up a network, this book will be a great help.The book gets a 4 for material, less 1 for its being dated."
2,Doe Boy falls short,I love NAI movies but I feel this one fell a little short on traditions andconnection to the mother earth and it's creatures. I took a chance buying a movie I had never heard about.
3,"not really my thing, but good enough","While I'm not normally a fan of background music, I guess this Klaus Schulze album provided a decent enough listen. For the most part, I felt the songs were too long, and lacking enough interesting ideas. Some of the sound effects were rather upfront and annoying too. But there WAS also lots of softer and more relaxing parts that dominated the majority of the music. It was alright I guess, but not something I will ever purchase."
3,Not so bad,"I am new to these books, but I have to say Stephanie Laurin's, writing is so beautiful. Even with this book being slow, I just love how she writes. It is like your right in the book with the characters. Her sex scenes are never dirty and astound you. And she is truly romantic. This book starts and stops, starts and stops. It is not the kind of book you cannot put down, but it is the kind of book you keep picking up, just because you get addicted to it and have to read it all.I liked devils story better, this one is to much the same, and for a second book in a series, I thought it was to soon to have a repeat of the first. However, I will not give up on this author. She is very gifted."
5,I like Vane the most,"I think it's pretty good, expecially Vane's character. He seems to be sensible than other Cynsters. I migth be wrong, just my impression. However, the mystery seems to be nothing and not so exciting. Well, that's the point, I suppose. This is a romance not a mystery."
3,"Not as good as ""Devil's Bride""","Vane Cynster is trying to get away from the matching making mama's, so a decides to leave London for awhile. A strong storm forces him to take shelter at godmother's home Bellamy Hall. Included the Lady Bellamy's odd guests is her niece Patience Debbington. For a while Vane fights the attaction, but he soon relizes that Patience is the one for him. But Patience and theif are much of Vane's time.""A Rake's Vow"" is the second in the ""Bar Cynster"" series by Stephanie Laurens and while I loved the first book, it was a struggle for me to finish this book. There just to much going on for me in this book. I am hoping that the series does improve."
3,Not to Bad,"This is the second in the Cynster Series after Devil's Bride. This is cousin Vane's story. He meets Patience at his godmother's estate and instantly knows she's fated to be his bride. The problem with that, is you never really know why. Towards the end of the book he decides he loves her but earlier in the book you never really know why she is the special one to him. I did like that the whodunit Ms. Laurens likes to put in each of her Cynster novels is more of a challenge this time. But that kind of fizzles out in the end too. However, this is still a satisfying story and anyone interested in the series should read it."
3,a little slow,"I liked Devil's Bride much better because it had more action and plot. The plot in A Rake's Vow was very thin since Laurens paid very little attention to the Spectre and didn't really develop it. It also seemed to me that she had trouble including everyone in the house party. There were times when she didn't mention some of them at all when they were all supposed to be together. Maybe there were too many people in her story.I also noticed that Laurens has a habit of using the word ""who"" as the subject of the next sentence after she ends the previous sentence with a name. I still enjoyed this book, but I think Loretta Chase is a much better writer."
4,Keep introducing me to the Cynster men!!!,"This was the first book I read of Stepjanie's Lauren's or the Cynster series. I am hooked!! Vane was so refreshing, and so real in his reactions. I thought Patience was wonderful!! I was surprised to read that the majority of the other reader reveiws found her boring. I have a very busy day with work and family, and found this book to be fun, engrosiing, a wonderful story, and not at all insulting of my intelligence. I loved this book, the story line, the characters, Vane, and the incredible love scenes. Maybe because this was the first of the Ms. Lauren's books, I was not set up for diappointment. I have since purchased ""Scandals' Bride"" and LOVED it am now ordering Devil's Bride. These Cynster Men are awe-inspiring!! Let me say that I would like to thank Ms. Lauren's for doing more for the lovelife in my 11 year marriage than anything else - Stephanie Lauren's writing is the most wonderful aphrodesiac!!"
2,Meh,"Something was definitely missing from this book. In the rest of the Cynster series, Vane is portrayed as one of the most enigmatic of the cousins. In his own story, however, Vane falls into the mold of the regency period rake. There is not much development to his character outside of this formula.Patience is just as typical of a character. I was bored with her.Laurens is also in the habit of repeating herself over and over again. She will use 3 adjectives where one simple description will do. I don't understand what her purpose in this display of vocabulary is, but it has the result of cluttering up the page with meaningless text to the point where it is difficult to follow the storyline.Between the flat, formulaic characters and the excessive verbiage of the descriptions (particularly when dealing with the emotions of the characters), I was just annoyed by the book."
2,Booooooring!!!!!!,"This is my third book by Stephanie Laurens, and unfortunately...I think its my last...I have tried to like this author, but I just cant do it. ""A Rakes Vow"" was sooo excruciatingly slow I wasnt even able to finish it...there was no plot..its just a bunch of way too long sex scenes broken up by chatting around the breakfast table...Not worth reading..."
3,Patience with Patience,"I like the serious minded Vane, but Patience thinks too much and this makes the story somewhat slow. Some of the characters are frankly absurd and don' t add anything to the plot. As much as I like the Cynster series, this is not one of my favourite books"
4,A Rake's Vow,"A friend recomended this book, I liked it, I've been so busy lately that I haven't a chance to read anything."
2,I'm still not finished!,"I've had this book for months, and have only made it about 3/4's of the way through it. I've read other books instead of finishing this one. I can't seem to get myself interested in it enough to finish, and that's extremely unusual for me. This was my second book in the Cynster Series, and I really liked Devil's Bride much better. I don't know if I will continue with the Cynster Series (when and if I even finish this one). At least I can see from other reviews that I'm not the only one disappointed in this book. I'm going to force myself to read the rest of it, but I honestly can't see myself continuing with this series.The plot is thin at best, and taking far too long to get interesting. Patience started getting on my nerves in the first few pages and I almost want Vane to walk away from her. With all her casual liason's with him, it's amazing that pregnancy or scandal never crosses her mind."
2,Cynster men do not beg!,"Not nearly as well written as ""Devil's Bride"". I was disappointed to see one af the Cynsters have to beg to get attention and the woman he wanted it from didn't have enough spunk to suit him. Let's hope Richard has better luck."
3,Read it because of Vane,"Truth be told, this book is below average.I'm really a fan of stephanie laurens and her previous book, devil's bride was like the book of the year! The cynster series is fantastic. However, Vane's story, A rake's vow, seems to fall short. Patience (our dear heroine), is too similar to her name. Being cautious to enter a relationship is one thing, but her hesitance give SLOW a new name. It reaches the point of being illogical. Vane is still true to form, the cool,elegant hero. Read the novel for Vane.This reader sincerely hopes the next book will be better. Laurens has immense talent."
3,A dissapointment after the first book of the series.,This book let me down. I enjoyed Devil's Bride so much that my expectations for Vane's story was really high. This did not turn out the way I thought. The characters were still in the style of Stephanie Laurens - strong heros and heroines - but there just was something missing in the storyline. The pace was a lot slower and Vane came off a little desperate towards the middle of the book. This would not have been a huge let-down if it were not for the wonderfulness of Devil's story. I will still look forward to the rest of the Cynsters though and hope that they're up to the standards of book 1.
3,A nice book - however not sensational,"If you you are a fan of this author, this is an alright book. Stephanie Laurens has however written much better books, so for those who have not read Stephanie Laurens, I do recommend ""Scandal's bride"" and ""Captain Jack's woman"" first. The latter is not part of the Bar Cynster. The first book in the Bar Cynster serie is Devil's bride. I don't think there is a need to read them following each other; in fact, I do think it is better to just read one by one because it gets a little boring to have part of the story repeated all the time and hear how marvellous (yes, I know what genre it is) those cousins are."
1,Vane deserved better!,"After reading Devil's Bride I couldn't wait for Vane's story to be published. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. Vane, who we met in Devil's Bride, would simply not succumb to marriage as easily as was portrayed in this book. The author had him put up no fight at all. In fact, it seemed to be one chapter after another of Vane agonizing over how he would convince Patience to marry him. Stephanie, what were you thinking? Vane deserved better! Please don't let Scandal down."
3,"Devil's Bride, take two","This is my second excursion into Stephanie Laurens' period love story. They are well written novels with much attention given to plot development. I enjoyed Evil's Bride somewhat, although I found the love between the main characters and the characters themselves, to be hardened.Take Two, and Rake's vow has a similar plot and love scenes to Devil's Bride, but with more emotional sensitivity, and the main character Vane, actually acknowledges his love for his bride Patience.It was a little slow is places with not a lot of action or movement with the story. And there were a lot of secondary characters, that at times it's a little hard to keep up with who's who.the love scenes were descriptive and intense, although sometimes the description was superfluous and too flowery that it made me roll my eyes. but in all, an entertaining novel and it certainly doesn't put me off reading the rest of the series."
3,Too Patient,"I agree with the reader who said to read this book for Vane. The character of Patience was a little hard to believe. She dragged her feet over too many pages! The writing itself was charismatic, interesting and just plain great, but Patience took too long to make up her mind. Vane, on the other hand, was just as a hero should be. Stephanie Laurens' first book, Devil's Bride, blew me away. I'm glad she revisited her original characters in this one...."
3,Enjoyable.,"This is the second in S Laurens' Cynster series started by Devil's Bride. Vane is an arrogant handsome ladykiller. Patience is well aware of her attraction to him - and Vane's to her. She is willing to gain experience of the exciting feelings his embraces invoke, but not trust him with her future. Vane sees her as his future. I recommend Devil's Bride also."
2,"Boring, no end","I have watch all three Zenki Saga, don't know why. Stuborness, a undying hope the characters will develope. By the 3rd Saga you have about 10 min of stock footage in every episode, plus the same basic plot must make writing and animating it easy. By the end if I had to watch Zenki break his bonds, get the axe and be powered up by his brother one more time I might puke. The character never seem to develope, they are the same emotionally by this saga as the first. I would have liked to seen Zenki grow up emotionally just a little bit and Chiaki too. Just when the plot looks like it might get iteresting the DVD is over, so unless there is a 4th saga that the end mid plot point and everything. To bad I kinda liked Zenki brother, he had more character and seemed the one of the smartest. Overall, load, bright, requires no concentration, read a book while watching it, you wont miss anything important by giving it only half your attention."
3,Here goes....,"Well, I have to say not bad at all. But the first one is better.It turns out Zenki has a BROTHER!!(the one on the cover)His name is Goki. An totaly nice, nothing like little Zenki. Together they make Zenki's true form come out...Two new pepole are introduced: a Chika with a gun(kinda [cranky]) and her boss. Suhma(the guy with the beads) only comes out like for 15 seconds and then leaves. .... Pertty cool but it felt boring and rushed at times. If your a true fan...you might scream bloody hell out of fustration the might throw it out of the window saying why the hell did I buy this!!!Once your calm down you'll run to it and pop it back in for round2.I really give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,For driving car at night?,"This tittle is rather for Klaus Schultze fans. It contains uncommon, good electronic music, which sounds great when driving in the darkness!"
5,Lots of fun songs for the family!,We are HUGE Bill Harley fans and this CD is packed with lots of fun and silly songs for the whole family. One of our favorites!
1,Not recommended,Got two sets. One broke after a month or two. Other set did the same. There are MUCH better products out there.
1,Southwestern Bell S60211 Full-Size,Don't waste your money. The headset is cheap. The volume is so low even when it is set at its maximum setting.
2,"Fuzzy, hollow sound on my end","The sound was not good on my end though the people I was talking to said it was fine. I spend many hours on the phone for my business, so I opted for the no frills Panasonic KX-TCA60."
1,Poor at best,"As another said, you need to know everything about everything before reading this book. I cannot decide what this book is supposed to accomplish. What is its purpose? Is it a technical book or an MS advertisement? After a couple hundred pages, I found myself tired of hearing ""You can""...this and ""You can""...that, only to find that the how is usually left out. Considering that web page design is a relatively simple task (compared to, for example OS design,) this book proves that it is possible for man-kind to mess up just about anything. The one good thing I discovered from reading this book is what not to look for in an InterDev development book. At best, it's a confusing introduction. I wish I took more time to sample this book before plopping down my cash. Do yourself a favor: get all the O'Reilly books having to do with web design and piece things together; the documentation that comes with InterDev is, I dare say, more usefull than this book."
2,"This 2nd edition is not much better, if the first was bad","I saw author's comment that this second edition has so much improvement over the first, so I bought one copy. I haven't read the first edition, but this second edition is hardly an improvement over anything, IMHO. I think the problem is that this book doesn't talk about problem solving, nor provide any insight to the product (VI 6)inner function. Ironically this is a book from Microsoft press."
1,Napkins are a better use for trees,"This book is a very trite and superficial treatment of Visual InterDev. It is somewhere between nothing and the documentation. Microsoft Press should be embarrassed to be associated with this book. As a professional developer and trainer, I recommend to my students MSDN and the Site Builder Network."
2,Look Elsewhere!!,This book goes nowhere on actually teaching someone how to build an interactive site. The authors would have served everyone better if they took the time to walk someone thru a project.
1,A waste of time and money,"Computer books seem to break down into one of three major categories: theoretical concept overviews, exhaustive step-by-step learning guides, or pinpoint reference guides (e.g. O'Reily In-A-Nutshell). This book is a muddled mix of all three without achieving the benefits of any. It's too lightweight and disorganized to be a reference manual and too cursory to be a learning guide.I am over 100 pages into this and I am not quite sure if I have learned anything useful. It was clearly written without an objective in mind, which is evident chapter after chapter. It was comforting to see that many others share my opinion. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing."
1,very bad quality,"This book is very poorly written---it doesn't teach you anything. I've read about 100 pages now and still couldn't find something real about InterDev. All the menus, toolbars, buttons in this book are for older versions of InterDev; I'm using V6.0(SP3) and can't find any of those mentioned in the book. Most of the description are just pointless. These guys don't know about InterDev---that's what I get from reading this book."
1,Not good book for anyone,"I bought this book with intetnion it is going to be advanced book about programming VID 6.0 as the title says. Instead it is book badly written with no examples of any help. The part about DHTML is talking about dynamic postitioning, but there are no examples for useful things like form validating and so on. Part about ASP is also bad and not advanced at all. Authors should think once again if they are going to write something like this book. Don't buy it. Point."
