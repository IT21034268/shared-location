3,Looks nice but not built well,"I put some black and white photos in here, and it really does look nice. However it is very poorly constructed, I'm afraid it will fall apart every time I hold it. There is one screw that keeps popping out of place and one of the hanging brackets were put on there upside down (with the edges to hold on to the nail facing up instead of down where they could actually catch the nail). Looks nice though sitting on a shelf."
3,okay,not something a kid would be able to understand even if you were to read it to them.but has some okay short stories for older kids
4,"Excellent, tasty, interesting and quick.","And they're menus too, not just recipes. A lot of them take up to 45 minutes which is not the fastest recipes I've found, but the taste is worth it any little extra time! I am very pleased to have quick veggie options in my repertoire now. Plus, no complicated planning involved. You get the recipe, shopping list, and when to start each step. And you get real-people size portions while eating healthy. My only problem with the book (which was a problem with her Dinner in Minutes as well) is with the layout. Put both recipes on the same page next time!! It is aggravating to have to continually flip back and forth when you are in a hurry. However, it has been a while since a cookbook made me want to immediately start cooking-- this one did. Be sure to try the tofu and shiitake ""tenderloin."""
2,Tried a number of recipes and didn't like,"I also was drawn to the pictures in the book and found the recipes I made to be tasteless. The gumbo sounded so great, but it was so drab. I could barely get down a bowl. I also made the goat-cheese enchiladas which I also found bland. I cook vegatarian at least 4 nights a week. This book is not a good starter vegatarian cookbook. Try Horn of the Moon for a better choice."
1,Not worth it,"My husband and I purchased this book recently and we have found that we should have saved our money. The recipes we have tried have been...well not terrible but definately not worth the effort. The instructions are clear and I think that anyone could cook from this book. The recipes just aren't very good. They lack flavor, visual appeal, and I would really like to know what four people she is feeding with a recipe that calls for a pound of potatoes. So if you are thinking about purchasing this book I would advise you to look a little more and find something that will help you create more enjoyable meals for yourself and your family. In other words don't waste your money."
4,Got the wrong DARK JUSTICE,"Hello, Amazon! You need to get your Dark Justice's straight. The Dark Justice listed in the description with Dick O'Neil, Begonia Plaza, Ramy Zada and Clayton Prince is a 1991 CBS late-night series. The photo of the DVD cover and the 2-star review accompanying it are from a feature release of some years later. The series does not deserve the 2 stars, while the feature may. Please clear up this confusion. I'm looking for the series, not the feature!"
4,YUP YUP,"Robert (William Bumler) is traumatized in his boyhood after witnessing his father's death. He lives in the streets with a nervous twitch and is known as the ""Yup Yup Man"" because he always says, ""Yup Yup."" Alarmed over all the crime that goes on in the city, and inspired by the comic book, ""Dark Justice"" Robert wants to fight back as a super hero known simply as ""cape crusader."" His bartender friend Jack helps him construct an outfit. After Robert kills seven people and shaves his beard, he loses his twitch. Blood, sexual situations, no nudity. Bumler did an excellent job as the bearded neurotic Yup Yup man."
3,Great story not told very well,"This is the story of one of the most facinating saints, but the story told here isn't told very well. This should look very dark - as in crossing through the dark night of the soul - yet the colors are very bright and upbeat. St. John of the Cross was all about embracing the cross and suffering, but that isn't communicated. It is not nearly as compelling as it could be"
3,a caveat,"to the reviewer above. I've only glanced at the book, but I disagree that an encyclical and a denunciation from the holy office would have carried the same weight. While an encyclical does not have the force of canon law, the holy office denunciation would have declared, in no uncertain terms, that nazism constituted a heresy. It would have been quite a bit stronger, and might have even led to an interdict against Germany, stopping services and ministration, and would have therefore been a tremendous source of social unrest."
3,"Great quality, annoying mute function","I use the GN9330 with my VoIP phone attached to my desk computer. Comfortable headset, great audio quality, good range and battery life.One major drawback: I spend too much time on conference calls, and as a courtesy, I mute my line when not speaking. However, when this headset is placed on mute, it beeps at you every 10 seconds as a reminder. This anti-feature cannot be turned off, and is inherent in the headset electronics. Muting using your computer results in the same incessant beeping.This seems to be standard behavior of Jabra devices. Be aware."
1,Needed of a chip upgrade,"The product may have been new as it was in an unopened box from 2006 (I was told this by Netcom customer rep. as I read off the serial # to them on the phone). The item had to be sent back to the manufacture for an upgrade to work on an operating system newer than XP. So for all of us that have windows 7 or Vista it will not work at all till the manufacture does a chip upgrade and for that it has to be sent back to Netcom. If you don't prove to them that you did infact bought it new, it will cost you 110 dollars for that upgrade plus the shipping charges too."
4,Thorough review of North African Food,"This author certainly knows the subject matter of this work and offers much in the way of descriptive background and recipes.A favorite from the book is the Kesksou Bil Djedg (Chicken couscous) a staple dish of Algeria. It is so good and healthy with vegiies and all the spices of this region.Included also are the typical fare of the area, tagines, and bastilla.I prefer Wolfert's works on this fare."
5,5 Stars for the Recipes,"I bought this book because it is very difficult to find an Algerian cookbook, especially in English. Although it is divided into Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, the Algerian recipes are authentic. The recipes are simple enough to make with ingredients that are readily available; and even if you can't find something, just improvise.It is always interesting to find out how a non-native of a country became interested in its culture/cuisine. Throughout the book there is a ""dialog"" he has about how he was introduced to various dishes (people he met and knew in these countries), as well as background information on the religion practiced by the majority of the people in these countries, Islam. The downfall is that some of the religious background is related more to customary practices of the regions rather than actual Muslim teachings. Moreover, the dessert section is minimal, but this book has recipes that are reminiscent of dishes ""back home."""
5,I Thinks There's a Difference,"My monitor has a VGA and DVI connector capability, a VGA cable is what was supplied with the monitor, the computer has VGA and HDMI connectors. While the monitor has no speakers the DVI to HDMI connection certainly appears to provide a sharper brighter picture. Imagination or just a desire for not having wasted 21 bucks, who knows? Would I do it again, yes and recommend the analog to digital swap looking for an improved display."
5,Great Product,"Ideal HDMI connection for the older version of the MacBook Pro, cerca 2008 version. Depending on your tv and the settings on your computer, you can produce quite the image. Great backup if the VGA happens to flop. If this is what your looking for, then it is a must buy. Cheap as well"
4,Great cable and price...new in box,"The cable has worked flawlessly, it looks well constructed, picture quality is excellent, no complaints here. (watch it tear up tomorrow)"
1,Steve Camp Justice CD,This product never shipped and I was given a full refund and little bummed and sad that the sender had already sold this item prior to receiving my order. :(
5,Born to Do it,"Craig's mix of R&B with a UK garage sound is wicked. I first herd of him about a year ago, and I knew then that he'd be making a big impact in the US."
5,Why Can I Not Stop Listening To This CD?,"Get this into your brain: Craig David is HUGE! Don't believe me? When I was in London, he was playing at Wembley Stadium and sold it out 2 nights in a row.Most of Europe already knows what the U.S. is about to learn... Craig David was born to do it and he's made an RnB album to rival anything coming out of the originality-challenged domestic music scene."
5,Thorough and detailed,"I was in the process of starting a consultancy, and realized that your contract IS your deal. Getting it right it extremely important. Between the book and the disk that comes with it, you are provided with a large set of clauses from which you can choose which ones you want, and basically write your own contract exactly as you want it. It explains contract law and what the clauses mean, but for a really detailed look into contract law, buy a law book on the subject.This book is very practical, and saved me several hundred dollars in legal fees. My attorney simply reviewed my contract and approved it!"
4,Buy but don't pay these prices!,Great videos but these prices are outrageous! Buy at Spectrum Connections! My children both have autism and love these videos and I highly recommended them. Go to the official site!
2,Not so great,"Bought this CD only to get the elusive original 12"" version of Pet Shop Boys' ""West End Girls."" The CD cover says it contains ""All full length extended versions."" Not true. ""West End Girls"" has been cut down by at least two minutes, and the edits aren't particularly clean. All the rest of the songs sound strikingly similar, as if all the artists had to share the same drum machine and synthesizer. Quite repetitive and not terribly interesting."
2,Too theoretical and abstract,"A strong start and a few good ideas along the way, but overall way too theoretical and not helpful to any pastor or church leader."
5,I love these speakers.,This was a gift for Christmas and I absolutely love it. The sound is spectacular and it is nice to have something that I can carry with me so many places. I have a friend with a Bose speaker setup for her iPod and the sounds is good but it's big and not portable. The sound on my jlab speakers is just as good and I can carry them around the house and take it with me when I travel. It's great that the iPod slides right in the back so I don't have to worry about cords or connections like with some other systems. I couldn't be more pleased and have showed and recommended it to several people.
1,SPEAKERS ARE NOT WORTH IT,These speakers are barely audible. So not worth the money. They sound like you're listening to a speaker out of a soda can. I would never but them again.
4,Great for the price,"For the price, hard to beat. Obviously, the sound quality is not going to be top notch, but perfectly acceptable for such small, lightweight, and portable speakers. Like other reviewers, I find the plastic sleeve you're supposed to seat the Nano in difficult to use. Hard to get the Nano in and out. One thing no one mentioned, is that JLab provides an extra connector cord that allows you to run the Nano on an ""Aux In"" input on the side of the speakers so you don't have to actually squeeze the Nano into the official holder to use it. When I'm working at my desk, I simply do this, which allows quick Nano disconnect from the speakers."
1,wow! This Thing Stinks!,"yeah, there I said it! it stinks! it says ""rich sound"", which means if you hold it 1"" from your FACE it's rich, otherwise it sounds like two dinky speakers making some arbitrary noise. the only thing good about this thing is that you can plug it into anything with a headphone jack, butcha gotta have power or batteries. if they'd only come out with a little hat for these that'll hold it right in front of your face maybe I wouldn't sent mine back."
4,Neat little speaker!,"The sound isn't the best, but what great sound for such a little speaker! This thing fits right in the pocket, is great on my desk and just about anywhere. I have 2 friends that looked it over when I got it and they bought it right away. It is a great IPOD accessory, even if it is a little on the expensive side."
4,"More, More, More","If you are looking for the song from THE SEX AND THE CITY promos here it is! ""More, More, More"" is a great song, and it is probably one of the best disco songs out there. The rest of the material comes close to that song's classic lush appeal! This is great for anybody who appreciates good dance music!"
4,Disco To Go......,One of the most enjoyable disco recordings that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. I really dig those groovy tunes.
2,"More, More, More is a fantastic song, but....","I was really rooting for Andrea True, really I was. One of my personal all time favorites, ""More, More, More"", is easily a 5 star song (and makes this buy actually worth it), but it is the only good track. The rest was pretty embarrassing disco cheese. It would have made a good soundtrack to a late 70's roller boogie porno movie had one ever been made. I suggest finding the title track on a compilation of disco hits for more enjoyment. Looks like Miss True finally got some respect this year, though, as the band Len sampled some of ""More, More, More"" on it's hit song ""Steal My Sunshine""."
3,I WANT MORE MORE MORE!,"Andrea True Connection came on to the scene in the late 70s with the #1 Pop Smash ""More More More"".The only down fall to this album was it should of been an EP, only a few songs were on this album I think 6 or 7 in all.But good ones they are ""Call Me"" and ""Party Line"", but the dance and the boogie don't last long because of the few songs. She only had one album which is this compilation, and some added bonus remixes of ""More More More"" ,""Whats Your Name, Whats Your Number"" and ""New York You Got Me Dancin'"".So actually you got 7 songs with three of them with (2) different versions....The problem here is that the strong songs like ""Pary Line"" and ""You Fill Me Up"", don't have their remixes on here to.Plus it wouldn't hurt to have a few more songs on this.Overall it is good disco, but works better as a 12 inch single than a album."
3,Dirk Diggler could have used her in a duet!,"If you lived in the 70's like myself, she was the ultimate disco diva along with Donna Summer. Though not as successful as Summer (due to her porn star past), she still had the range towards mainstream acceptance. The album is not as good as I thought. But, if you want to re-live days of Jimmy Carter and ""The Fonz"", buy this CD."
5,Good for kids of all ages,This is one of the best dvds. My grandkids want to see it over and over. This is one I will watch with them.
4,Holds attention,Bounce: Routines! by BounceBounce: Let's Talk! by BounceI purchased two of these DVD movies (Routines & Let's Talk) for a young family member who is 6 years old & is non-verbal. She seems to really enjoy watching these DVD's & stays glued to the TV while they are on. I am hoping that they will start to help her make some progress as time goes on. The fact that she shows such an interest in them says something in itself. I am glad that I chose to make this purchase.
3,Performs as promised,"PROS:Item works as promised. The unit was truly ""plug-n-play"" and has been compatible with the 6 or 7 games I've tried. The unit also works well with my PC speakers (although sound quality diminishes with the length of the audio cables).CONS: After reading about these converters I had hoped to get an improved resolution on my VGA monitor over my TV. I would say the resolution is equivalent (perhaps even not a good for on screen text). Also need to provide your own second VGA cord.BOTOMLINE: If you want a reasonably priced PS2 to VGA converter that gets the job done this is a good unit."
5,Nothing to add that hasn't been said,"I have to add in my own words, though others have already said it sooner, so I won't go into many details. this book is a lyrical dream. the patterns are inspirational (and aspirational. I'm not sure I'll ever do Margret Tudor, but I can dream) The colorwork is masterful, and far beyond what is being seen in recent designs produced today. A must have book for anyone interested in colorwork. Her textured work is also stunning, but these are not easy pieces, they require focus and attention, and a great deal of patience. to me it's all worth it"
4,An interesting look at an Irish Detective,"This is the first in a long series of books with Chief Inspector McGarr, based in Dublin after a long career with Interpol. This book focuses on Ireland's relationship with the IRA, and is quite interesting. The capabilities of master cop McGarr are also impressive. The story was well crafted, although there isn't much of a mystery involved. I am looking forward to see if that improves in later books in the series."
5,Beautiful,"Incredibly beautiful item. Has patina, personality, class. It is extremely well build. I bought it for all these reasons and I was not disappointed when I received it. Everyone around me admired my new pendant and wanted to know where I acquired it from. I am very pleased with my acquisition, it is now one of the most beautiful pendants I own."
1,Don't try and save,After replacing several oxygen sensors I would recommend not to buy aftermarket ones but instead buy one from the dealership. The aftermarket ones only last a few months and then you end up having to buy another one which is more expensive than just buying the manufacturer one from the start....
1,Disappointing 3rd album,"I had high hopes for this album,the first and second having been so great.At no point does this album deliver.The interweaving of traditional Marrocan instruments with Andalucian song on previous albums worked seamlessly;here they have taken to many disparate sounds and lost themselves in the melee.If you want to listen to real Flamenco nothing can come close to El Camaron de La Isla."
5,Great!,"If you're into flamenco music in any way, this will be a nice addition to your collection. A bit of flamenco mixed with arabic sounds. Original! Good indeed. actually, very good."
5,Stephen Bly Captures the Spirit of Dakota,"This was the first book I've read by Stephen Bly, and I am more than anxious to read the next in the series. As a former resident of the Black Hills, I found Bly's descriptions of the Dakota landscape accurate enough to make me homesick. His characters are well developed and sympathetic, and I especially enjoy his sparkling dialogue passages that help develop the characters and bring comic relief and a sense of comraderie between the characters not unlike the good natured humorof a good John Wayne movie. I look forward to reading the second book in this series."
3,I Want You - Savage Garden,"UK CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""I WANT YOU"" - SAVAGE GARDEN1) Sash Extended Mix2) Sharp Miami Mix3) Xenomania Funky Mix1998"
3,Useful for class,"While the text is a bit heady, it serves the purpose for the class I'm taking. Some good points are made."
2,Some Truth,This is a book that puts me to sleep. I would not have purchased it if it were not for school. Wake me up when it is over. It does have some truths in it but not all truth. The best advice is to stick with the Word of God. If it does not line up with the teachings of the Word then do not waste your time with believing the teachings in it. Please do not teach it according to the author's perspective.
5,Excellent Overview of the Major Christian Doctrines,"The book is an outstanding overview of major Christian doctrines. It was balanced and fair in presenting a wide range of viewpoints. The last section dealing with imaginary dialogues between such notables as Barth, Neibuhr, Bultmann, Moltmann, etc.. is interesting although familiarity with the basic tenets of these thinkers helps in understanding the subtleties of their arguments."
4,Tells It Like It Is,"Being a seminary student I have plodded through a lot of theology textbooks. This one goes beyond the rest mainly, I think, because it is grounded in the sensible (formerly radical) ideas of John Barth. It is thorough without being heavy-handed, clear without being too long, and sits on the correct premise that everything starts and ends with Jesus Christ as God in concrete form. That's how we know God -- through Christ. It's almost as if I can throw out my other books -- this seems to cover it all. Kudos, Migliore."
4,"Very fun, but not the most practical","I do absolutely love this timer, and I would recommend that you get one. However, I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it isn't practical enough to use as your one-and-only kitchen timer.1. It can only time up to 99 minutes.2. After playing the cute song it turns off. So if you had something in the oven and didn't get around to taking it out during the 30 seconds or so that the song was playing, there would be no further reminder for you."
5,Smitten with Fred!,"I love, love, love this timer! The three retro game-show inspired jingles are so catchy and happy, and the spinning, whirling blender mesmerizes my best friend's 9 month old baby girl with delight. This little product brings such joy to my kitchen that I cannot recommend it emphatically enough."
3,"Hemp seeds are good, but air is in the packaging","Not at all an air tight seal on these seeds. When they arrived (and I have ordered these quite a few times), there is air inside the supposedly vacuum-sealed bag. This is not good for the seeds as it oxidizes the oils inside the seed and makes them go rancid. I still buy them seeds because they're the cheapest ones and you get a lot, but that should definitely be improved. Other than the packaging, great hemp seeds!"
5,Great in smoothies,Would recommend for those who want a healthy lifestyle. Add to smoothies and you have a power drink. Great for before or after a workout.
1,I must have received a bad batch,"I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again."
3,Great Expectations not Realized,"I had great expectations when I purchased these hemp hearts as someone at our local health food store was very enthusiastic about its ability to cut appetite and thus worked for weight loss and control I found it pleasent to eat, tastes fine and texture is appealing although the seeds get caught in my teeth and under my gums so I need to brush, rinse and floss quickly after eating it. I was surprise to read the fat content at 45 percent so I am only eating it with breakfast. I don't think this is any miracle food supplement and probably will not buy again unless something changes with my experience. I've used it for a month now with no noteable impact."
1,Bad taste and burn,"I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much. In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least. Poor taste, plus a horrible burn all the way down my throat. I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise. Unfortunately I did not keep the packaging, since I had immediately transferred the seeds to glass containers to prepare for freezing. These seeds are going in the compost bin (hope it doesn't burn the worms!)"
1,makes me want to throw up,"Tastes like burnt weed, and should be treated accordingly (thrown out, which is exactly what I did). I don't care if its good for you, because so are a million other foods that taste infinitely better. The concept of someone actually enjoying the taste of this completely escapes me."
2,Tastes weird,"I roasted it but it still tastes weird, in a bad way. I wouldn't buy this again. The quality of the product is good, hence the 2 stars, otherwise, I would have given it 1 star because I just wasted my money on this product."
2,Excellent but price jumped from $36 for 5lbs,"Last year I bought this same product when it cost $36 for a 5lb bag using subscribe and save. Now, it's nearly $60 for a 5lb bag which is why I gave it just a 2 star rating. Would've gave it a 1 star, but it is an excellent product. Too bad the price doubled."
2,Appeared to be full of shells,"Being aware of hemps's nutritional properties and being advised by a friend of how tasty toasted hemp seeds are, I was predisposed to a favorable opinion of this product. However, after lightly toasting the seeds and sprinkling them on a salad, my first impression after a bite was that there were a bunch of shells among the seeds. I have no idea if the package I received was simply a bad batch or if hemp seeds always have such a gritty consistency but it seemed to me that I was eating shells as much as seeds. I'm going to try Bob's Red Mill hemp seeds and see if they are any different. In the meantime, I gave away this package to my neighbor who has chickens."
5,DELICIOUS,"These have a slight nutty flavor. If you do not like peanuts then you might not like these. We have been putting them on and in everything from fruit smoothies, eggs, salads, chicken, pasta dishes."
2,smell rancid,"has anyone else noticed a rancid smell with these? they are also slightly green in color (the white parts are white, but the black shells also have a green counterpart.) I don't know if this is normal. I keep a small amount in the fridge for several weeks use, in a mason jar, the rest in the freezer. I usually mix them in smoothies, and didn't try them alone until just now for the purpose of this review. The taste is nutty, I don't detect any rancid taste... just the smell that makes me inclined to stop using them. I read that hemp seeds go rancid like an hour after being hulled."
5,hempteriffic,"Nutiva hempseed is fresh and goodtasting. I use it to make salad dressings, milk, smoothies and I sprinkle it over my food to give it a crunchy nutty taste as well as nutritional value and fiber."
1,Not good anymore,"I ordered this product based on good reviews like 2 months ago and i really loved it and I ordered another 3 pound bag a month later, the second bag was just not right, I thought i must be a bad batch or something because it had more green shells in it and the seeds looked more brownish, it had this bitter burning taste. I called amazon and they said they would send me another ( i really did not wanna give up on it so i wanted to try another), same thing. I called again and they said they would send me another just to make sure that it was not a fluke. I got the bag 2 days ago and the same thing :( finally i gave up on it. I will look in to another brand. I am really curious if other people are having the same issue.."
5,Lovely hempseeds,"Hempseeds is one of my favorite foods.it has a lot protein and fiber. I like and trust this product and label. Since I am vegetarian, I use hempseeds daily. My use of this food is too numerous to mention it all. You could try it on your salad , baking bread or pastries, as snack in a bowl of nuts, raisins,dried cranberries or whatever else that you might like. This food is so delicious that you could use it by itself and be happy with your choice. I recommend for people who do not know this food to give it a try. I do not think you could do wrong.those who know this item, happy eating."
3,Inconsistent at best - too many hulls,"I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component.I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound bags I can get at the store.My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of themAnd they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating.I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging.I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments.Grrrrr...."
5,Excellent,I am a firm believer in the health benefits of Hemp. This product is the best I've found. The delivery was very prompt and efficient!
1,Will not buy this again,"I have had wonderful results from Manitoba Harvest hemp, but this was a better deal, I thought. Not the case. Lots of shell bits and the hemp bits are tiny. And my physical reaction was nothing like I had with Manitoba. Disappointed."
3,Good flavor but has some shells,Tastes fresh but there are small amounts of seed hulls and weed seeds mixed in. Can be a little gritty to chew on. Will try a different brand next time.
5,Delicious! Best form of plant based protein,Has a unique flavor that I've grown to love and eat it with everything. Yogurt or in salads and sometimes blend it into smoothies. Perfect for people resistance training and eating in between meals to keep a good protein supplement continuous throughout the day.
2,Tastes terrible,You may or may not like the taste. Very strong flavor & did not like the taste on any of the foods I tried it on. Yuck. I have friends that just love it.
1,"Discolored, compromised","Be careful when ordering. The package I received was not air-vacuum sealed like previous orders. As a result, the contents were comprimised, creating a rancid smell and bitter taste. After one teaspoon I was forced to discard the entire contents of my 3-pound bag, which resulted in a complete waste of money. Amazon does not allow returns for this product. Buyer BEWARE."
3,Maybe not for everyone,"I put a heaping teaspoon of this product on my usual cereal (Nature's Path Heritage) and skim milk -- got really bad diarrhea for the next two days.I also tried the Nutiva's chocolate HempShake and I loved the taste of that -- I added about 8 oz of skim milk. Seemed agreeable for two days, then on the third day the combination gave me several hours of rotten-egg flatulence like I have never experienced in my life. Again, I had skim milk and hemp together in combination.Too early to say it's the hemp, might be the combination -- maybe hemp creates a digestive environment where the milk is indigestible. Usually I can eat just about anything so I was very surprised. I'll give it another try someday...If anyone has any insight, please feel free to comment."
5,"Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 Pound Bag",I bought this to spread on top of my breakfast cereal but discovered that you can eat it by the spoonful. It tastes nutty and is absolutely delicious. High in protein and iron so you're off to a good start including this in your breakfast.
5,Completed my set,This is just one of several I purchased. This 2-1/2 quart saucepan fills one of my greats needs and with out any disappointment. Its one of the nicest and clean lines.
4,"The Raconteurs' ""Big Hit""","This is their big hit, and deservedly so (although they nicked the bass line from Joe Jackson's ""Is She Really Going Out With Him""). ""The Bane Rendition"" is a non-album instrumental--it's got a ""Green Onions"" feel to it, which is not a bad thing."
1,Steady as She Goes~the Raconteurs,I didn't realize when I bpought this CD that it had only 2 songs on it and it was very expensive for only 2 songs. i think it was something like $12+. I was going to return it but just missed the 30 day return policy. I bought it on Dec.4 and wasn't really thinking about returning things as soon as Jan.4. I will need to be much more careful next time I think about ordering anything like that.
3,It's Not All I Expected.....,"I'm not as happy about this CD as I wanted to be. Out of 12 songs, I only like four: ""Passion"", ""Calling All Boys"", ""Jukebox (Don't...."", and ""New Toy"" which were their biggest club hits. If you're a Flirts fan, then I'm sure the entire collection is perfection, but if you're like me and are looking for club music from the 80's, this may not work for you. I'm not sorry I bought it as I love the four songs mentioned above. I'm happy to have them blasting from my car, home and PC, but if you're looking for 12 great songs you know, you will be disappointed. If you can't find ""Passion"", ""Calling All Boys"", ""Jukebox (Don't...."", and ""New Toy"" on other collections (and you can as I already have), then get this CD, otherwise, only Flirts fans need to get this CD."
1,Warning!,"Warning! I love The Flirts but I never buy CD's from Hot Productions anymore. They both look and sound cheap. It's known among music fans all over the world that the sound quality is awful on their CD's, so stay away from them!"
4,the Flirts in Full,"""The Flirts"" are three girls (but not always the same three!) brought together by New York disco producer Bobby 'O' in the early 1980's to provide vocals for his trademark thumping hi-nrg sound. Bobby 'O' must have heard and loved ""Funky Town"" by Lipps Inc, as he seems to have spent most of his career using it as a blueprint for his songs. Luckily, this package gives you a bit of variety as it spans the Flirts five albums, starting with the biggest hit ""Passion"", which is the best track, after which come some of the more flippant girly numbers like ""On The Beach"", which aren't really very good for dancing to, but then its back to the winning formula with the steamy ""Helpless"" and ""Danger"". The songs are chronological, and you will notice in the later tracks such as ""All You Ever Think about Is Sex"", when Bobby decided to remake Janet Jackson's ""Nasty""! All in all, a fun album, and a great round up of this groups best material."
1,"expecting great memories, but what did i get?","i ordered this release last week from amazon and couldn't wait to hear it, but when i got it yesterday, i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd, instead of getting 15 tracks of music like i was promised, i got 10 tracks and 44 minutes of spanish ballads! oh, my lord, what in the world happened!? well, i guess you can't hear 'em all, can ya? i'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time. oh, by the way, the one star is not for the flirts music, for that is 5 star material anyway, but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music."
2,This Oasis Provides Only Moderate Refreshment,"The plot of THE LAST OASIS is relatively straightforward and involves a theme often used during the first three seasons: a woman's attraction to Richard Kimble protects him from the law. The chemistry between the woman Hope Lange is nowhere near the level as registered by Suzanne Pleshette or Susan Oliver, but she seems happy to help him out of a tight spot. In Arizona, Kimble has been shot by a cop, and Annie (Hope Lange) nurses him back to health, amidst suspicions by a small town policeman who cares for Annie too that she is shielding him from the law. This is a by-the-numbers Girl-helps-Kimble story redeemed only by the earnestness of Hope Lange. Nothing new about Kimble or his past is revealed."
3,Puff piece on stones,"I rented this video thinking it would reference the cave painting it uses as cover art, but found that it is little more than a travelogue. That worked out okay, since my father, who's dreamt of seeing Paris since the Henry Miller fifties, enjoyed the segments dealing with that city.If you want a beautifully photographed, engagingly, yet intelligently narrated tour of the cave paintings of Lascaux, save your money, and simply view the six-part series available free on You-tube."
3,Yiannis' review,This is just to correct Yiannis. L'Trimm actually put out two more albums before they disappeared from the music world. They are out of print: 1. DROP THAT BOTTOM (1989) 2. GROOVY (1991)
3,One On One,The movie is great. I have been waiting for this to come on DVD for quite sometime. The DVD features however leave a bit to be desired. Widscreen format would have been nice too.
5,Great movie,"Great movie with some Seals and Crofts to boot.AND it's always great to see more and more people realize that yes, spike lee IS an idiot. Always has been, always will be. But then it seems we have become predominantly, a nation of idiots."
1,WAAAY overpriced,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, but there is no way to justify the price of this movie. Movies that are even more famous from around the same time period (Grease, Jaws, The Deep, Smokey and the Bandit) all hover between $5 and $8, so what is the problem here?"
4,Good Movie,"Small town boy finds his footing in the big city. Interesting look at big colleges, and what they might have been like in the late 70's."
4,Just Hollywood,"Here is a good look at the behind the programs of college sport. Of course, we know that this is just hollywood. It get pretty ruff for a young man with big dreams of playing college basketball. To find out there is more to it then just playing basketball. But coming out a winner in the end. One for your sports collection........."
5,"dirty,disgusting,and i loved it",it was gross. it was dirty...it even comes packaged with a barf bag( i almost had to used it twice.) if gross out humor and pain are your cup of pee then pick this bad boy up
1,ZERO STARS,"there's a reason why this movie is going for 9 cents...They couldnt pay me enough to sit through this again. thankfully, i downloaded it for free, so I didnt lose any money.Its a bunch of grown men, acting like children, except children dont behave this badly. Nothing's funny, nothing's original...its just sad. I dont know how this even became a movie. Its a sad commentary on the world today"
2,"not unrated, disappointing","I ordered the ""UNRATED"" dvd. This means that the video is censored, blurred out and maybe a mild R rating.Just a cheesy knockoff of Jackass.Some funny and gross parts, but kinda boring."
1,"Shite,Pure Shite","This is the english attempt at JACKASS and it just plain fails (no way in h3ll this deserves 4 and a half stars). Its obvious that everything is scripted all the way down to the forced laughter.If you see this ""movie"" for sale do all of humanity a service by buying it and destroying it. It is truly that bad.The people that are giving this show positive reviews must have a stake in it financially."
3,How about Releasing the Reuion Movies again?,"I wonder, does any body know where I could get a copy of the The 3 TV Movies: The Prequel film from the 80's,JR Returns, and War of the Ewings? Not the best pieces of work in the ""Dallas"" Saga, but a nessesity if you are a fan of the show and want a COMPLETE Collection? Any help would be greatly appreciated?"
5,Picture Painting with Word and Music,"Joshua has converted me! His ability to paint pictures with words and music is unsurpassed. The songs on ""Painted Desert Serenade"" tell a story, and draw you into the story. You can't help but feel a part of what is happening. I particularly like ""Beautiful in My Eyes"" and ""Mama's Arms""."
5,Picture Postcards from L.A is my favorite song.,My favorite song of all time is Picture Postcards from L.A. Ever since I was a little girl I have liked that song. My sister has this tape and when ever I see her I ask her to play it (one of these days im going to have to get a copy). My name is Rachel and at first I just liked the song because of this. But as I got older the message became more clearer and now I enjoy the song more than ever before. Theres somthing about it that just pulls you in and gives you a wonderful feeling. As for his other songs their wonderful to.
5,Joshua Kadison Painted Desert Serenade,"This is a great CD. I owned it when it first came out and recently misplaced it, so I purchased another one. It's as great now as it was then. The songs are original, it's very relaxing to listen to, and Joshua has a wonderful voice. If you like soft rock, this is a CD for you!"
5,"Soothing, soul touching songs . . .","A wonderful lyricist, fantastic pianist, and all around talented individual, Joshua Kadison's ""Painted Desert Serenade"" album is the only one to stay in my CD changer for 2 years straight. This is the album to drive by, clean by, make love by, and live by."
4,Orwell Revisited,"Currituck has a vision of near-future America that is at once hilarious, outrageous and chilling--with the events of 9/11 only adding to the effect. Told in lean, page-flipping prose, ""Stars"" will grip the reader from page one to the stunning climax. An entertaining novel that will both stimulate and amuse from beginning to end."
4,Pretty impressive. Still standing the test of time.,"Three Simple Words 14. Wiggedy WackGood stuff. They still got that funkiness of ""Something Good,""plus more. The tracks are quite diverse in styles. ""Power to the beats"" is a great breakbeat tune I could see Fatboy Slim remixing. Lost Vagueness is up-beat, trancy-- Paul Oakenfold had already used in his Travelling album. B777 is a great melodic trance tune perhaps resembling Art of Trance and someother Platipus record lable group. Vocals in ""three simples words"" are quite beautiful. A few other tracks may be compared to Basement Jaxx or Leftfield. Eventhough Utah Saints shows diversity in their music they still maintained their signature sounds (you'll figure out listening to them). They've spinned with Leftfield on Radio 1 UK, essential mix. So I guess they could be comparable. A great buy, though."
1,Coast soap,I did not receive the item I ordered. I ordered the eye opener that was pictured and received Pacific Coast. Husband not a happy camper.
5,Fantastic,"This book is fantastic!!! Christopher Lynch really captures the story of early aviation pioneers and the challenges they faced reaching success as they soared the skies. The hundreds of photos in the book show a great story alone. The Wright Brothers, other early aviators, the movie stars! Lynch must have spent countless hours gathering all of the photos displayed in the book. This book should be recommended reading for all students of Chicago history and aviation."
4,"Very Good, but bigger than expected.",This product is highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated and Consumers Report and we like it and agree with the good ratings.
1,not what I expected,"It looks really nice, but the first thing I cooked the pan would not come clean. I boiled peanuts, of course, with lots of salt and the water turned black. I cleaned the pan and the peanuts and the water turned black again, as if it had some kind of reaction. The pan does not look good anymore. Cannot get it clean."
2,The Devil is in the Details,"When reading a story, I understand many look for realistic details to make them feel a part of the characters. Waiting For Yesterday certainly is long on details. In my opinion, the author could have left out the unsavory descriptions of childbirth(a man's hand shoved up into the heroine's uterus), the disgusting vivid account of breast engorgement(and breast milk shooting across the room), baby biological functions(specifically descriptions of feces being smeared on the heroine). I could go on, but I'm sure by now you get the picture.If it weren't for the unnecessary descriptions, which fill an abundance of pages in this book, the story could have been enjoyed more. I do admit to finishing the book, due to interest in how Barrett, the main character, would choose her fate.Normally, I would give a short detailed description of the overall story, but I won't bother this time since I sincerely suggest spending your reading entertainment dollars on a different book!"
4,One to pick up,"I actually borrowed this book from my younger sister, and went ahead to buy a couple more by the author. She is my new favorite. This book was a very nice change from the grocery store romance I so often give a try (and end up disappointed). I really felt for the characters!Very different I thought, and I really did love it right up until the end. Great book, Ms. Lykins keep them coming! (I'm waiting for your next one)"
5,The last of the LOT is a Classic,"A must read before you die. Age shouldn't impede you from reading this almost gothic, dark and supremely realistic book. The writer has combined all known genres and weaved them to present an exquisite piece of work.Is a classic is a classic is a classic...100 Stars are not enough........WOW...."
5,Grat book on basic techniques,"I saw this book in my jewelry class and decided I need one of my own. Instructions are short, clear and straightforward. Book was very cheap, in good condition and was sent right away, just shipping and handling was much more that I expected, may be because I'm in Canada but in local store I would pay probably more even if I could find it at all and I would loose much more time on all that shopping."
4,Nice Sweatshirt,"Great company - GotApparel.com. This fleece was ordered for my husband as a gift. The very nicely made, soft fleece was too long in length for my husband's short torso. GotApparel.com was extremely accomodating, kind and helpful. I would definitely order from this company again."
3,Very Interesting Documentary about the Making of the Boys in the Band,"I loved the movie the Boys in the Band, I enjoyed this documentary of how the play and movie was made however I was more interested in learning a bit more about the actors who played in the movie and a little bit more depth on whoCrowley based his characters on and motive of why some characters acted as they did to the other characters. I felt the movie was more about The Making of Mart Crowley..."
4,Informative - a must see for those who have watached Boys in the Band,"Anyone who watched the 1960's movie ""Boys in the Band"" video must see ""Making of the Boys."" It is informative, interesting and offers an insight about the characters in the movie, their opinions of the film as well as opinions of fans - and others who objected to showing the ""Boys"" as too gay. Many of the actors have since died of AIDS and one of a non-related disease. Since the original movie was made. A few went on after so many years and continue to act today."
4,How on earth did they get Walken to appear in that wonderful video??,"First I saw the WEAPON OF CHOICE video with Christopher Walken. I'd never really heard FATBOY SLIM and that was my introduction. The cd has a few greats and a few misses. I wish KALIFORNIA had been on it.All in all, it was worth the money."
2,Just Words,"I'm afraid I made a mistake. When I buy ""birding"" books I assume they will include pictures - photographs even! - of, guess what? Birds! Wrong assumption in this case. I was pretty disappointed but I guess the book does not claim to be a field guide. I haven't read a word. I'm sure I'll get around it."
4,"FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!!!!","""Basket of Wishes"" is definitely a book that I will not soon forget..The love story was unbelievably sweet...and sooo funny...you cannot help but laugh out loud while enjoying it....I would have gladly given this story 5 stars, however, I found Jourdian's temper tantrums to be rather tiresome, but all in all, a great read."
3,Cute,"The fairy tale story was cute and sweet, but it was a little too...fairytaleish? There was too much magic going on, like the part where Splendor's sister turns Jourdian into a slug? However there are also some very funny parts. If you like the fairy tale side of a story, then this is for you. To me, it just didn't seem real or ""real-like."""
5,Escape Reality,"If you wish to escape reality for a few hours into the realm of impossibility this is the read for you. This is the first book I have read of this kind and surprisingly I enjoyed it. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the most impossible antics that went on in this book. You won't be disappointed even if this is not your usual read. So, go ahead, try it and take a walk with the fairies in 'A Basket of Wishes'!"
1,Didn't work,"Plugged in and recognized the SSD, but when I tried to format it to install Windows it would throw an error. My other cables didn't do that and it works fine on them. I just don't have my storage drive until I get a new cable!"
5,works great,"this little dealy-bob will get you connected in a tight space. It's a very well constructed cable, too. You'll like it."
5,Does what its suppose to,Does what its suppose to. I need to type more to meed the requirements. Dang I need five more words...that did it :)
1,"Canceled order, no reason given.",Merchant canceled order and yet is still selling same item. Unreliable merchant. Never gave reason for cancellation. Don't waste your time with them.
3,Took a while and package was ripped up,"I recently bought a new hard drive, so I bought this to hook it up. It took a little over a week to come, and the envelope was completely ripped up. Luckily, the cord was not damaged. Good product, but its packaging and time of delivery was pretty awful."
5,"It's a cable, it does the job.",Just as advertise. I wish I had got one that was 6 inch longer though. It does the job and it works.
5,Good,Producto excelente y buen estado entregado a tiempo y en condiciones óptimas altamente recomendado el vendedor y con buena credibilidad
5,A price beater,"Hey, take a look in the retail stores. These guys have the same product for a whole lot less! Why not buy from Startech. By a couple too have on hand at this price!No problems with the quality or fit. Give them a try."
4,The right angle plug is great for tight places.,The right angle plug is great for tight places. Otherwise it's just a fine cable. I have begun to favor the ones with latches as I have had some of these come loose with vibration or moving a system from place to place. Spend a little more and get a nicer cable - I think it's worth it.
2,Problem with sata cables,"Be aware, as most sales people are not, that SATA cables with a right angle connector to the drive come in right and left handed versions. These will run in opposite directions, so depending on your computer, the cable might not reach the motherboard sata port and may interfere with the cabling to a second adjacent hard drive. The one I received (no choice offered) was of the wrong handedness and would not work."
5,Works great,The cables were exactly what I needed. They were delivered very quickly (2 days with standard delivery). I'm very happy with this purchase.
3,Know your case is right,"I bought this cable thinking it could go in any computer case because I could plug the angled end into the motherboard or into the drive. Wrong! This cable is not compatible with my rather new Dell Inspiron 530. The angled end would not fit into the only available port on my motherboard. And because hard drives are screwed into the case upside down, when the angled end of the cable is connected to the drive, the case does not close. I found out that I really needed a LEFT angle SATA data cable - which is fairly uncommon. Staples, or at least the one near me, does not carry SATA data cables at all. So, I had to travel about 25 miles to a large computer store to buy a straight cable. The store also had left angle SATA cables but I decided to play it safe. The moral is be very careful about buying angled SATA data cables and make sure it will work with your case with the available ports. Can't comment on the quality of the cable because I can't use it."
4,Just what it said it is... but not what I really needed.,"My cable came as described. What I got caught off-guard by was the right angle, for my purposes (a 2nd hard drive going into my Dell Dimension E520), was that the right angle was in the wrong direction; ie. I needed it flipped 180 degs. Since these SATA connectors are 'L' shaped, they only go on in one direction, so the 90 deg angle points the cable in the opposite direction of where it needs to feed back to. Hadn't thought to check on that, and isn't necessarily the problem of the vendor, although it would be great if they offered both styles and pointed out in the description . There was enough slack that it still works - I'll just need to be careful taking the PC cover off and on so that I don't snag this cable (HD connections are directly against the sides of the cover)."
4,Works exactly as it should. A little stiff.,"I knocked off one star because it is an extremely stiff cable, moreso than the other SATA cables in my PC system.I do like the right angle nature of this cable.So far no issues. I connected this cable to my new SSD and have had nothing but great performance since."
1,Description Wrong-The one here says right angle the one shipped is a left angle,"If you are needing a right angle SATA cable don't buy this one. As far as tge quality of the cable, it looks alright but I am not able to use it so I can't say anything for it. Gave it a one star for not being the right product."
4,"Good fast shipper, alright product","StarTech's shipping was fast and eggicient for my small order. The 18"" right angle sata cable was adequete, but it could have been better. It was plenty long enough for my small tower, making tight installion easier. However the plastic used on ends is britle and cracks easily if not installed very carefully. A more durable plastic would have been preferable(thus my 4 stars, instead of 5). Mine did crack, but I did not ask for a return because I was able to fix it easily with a little super glue and I needed it right away. The end pieces could have been locking making replacing the hard drive inclosure simpler since cables would not keep coming unpluged. My computer could have used a lefthanded 90 degree angle rather than the standard right angle I ordered. However, no one seems to make a left handed angle SATA cable. Over all I would order from them again. If I need another product, because of their quick shipping and good pricing."
4,Great cables,I bought these because I thought the price for a right angled SATA connector was very good! I didn't realize that the motherboard came with SATA cables (actually much higher end than these). Unfortunately they didn't hold as well on my Thermaltake H10 case. These StarTech Cables held MUCH better.
2,"Beware, NOT 90deg.","Although the picture shows a 90deg cable, I did not get that one, I received a straight ended one which are useless to me, Emailed seller and got no resolution to the problem...."
1,Not an angled connector on mine,"I took to heart the previous reviews, cautioning that one of the connectors was 90 degrees and pointing upwards. Exactly what I needed for my Dell. The cable I got had straight connectors on both ends! With a very sharp kink on the cable the cover closed with a push and the drive runs. However, I will not be surprised if the cable fails. My guess is a wrong cable was mailed. The cable is called on the shipping slip SATA18RA1 (RA=right angle?). The bag itself has only single marking (0.5 m = ca. 18 inches as advertised). There is no good way was the person pulling the order to know if it is an angled connector or not except to know the merchandise an look. I will see if I can return it, but at the price of the cable and cost of shipping and hassle, this seems hardly worth it. Even this review is costing me more time than is the cost of the cable. Still, I use other people's reviews, so I thought I would return the favor."
5,As Promised,"Required when you add a ""bare bones"" internal SATA disc drive. I believe most PCs lack a data plug for a second drive. My PC had an extra power plug so I didn't need a separate power cable. Worked with no problems."
3,Be careful,"I ordered this ""2 ft"" cable becaause I needed a 2 foot cable. What got was 21 inches. The seller sent a longer one to accommodate me...30 inches. It works of course but I have to deal with the slack...."
4,Good Cable,The cable works good. It is a sturdy cable and the connectors are a good quality. I have had no problems with the cable.
5,It works,"I didn't vote on the packing because I can't remember it; I always wait a while prior to post a review to make sure the product will last more than a couple of weeks.This SATA cable is longer than expected which worked great for me!!!I opened an external hard drive and hot-wired it to the motherboard of my PC, but the SATA cables found within the external device were ridiculously short. I purchased 2 of these SATA cable and since they were long, they allowed me to reorganize the inside of my pc allowing room for air to circulate and increasing my PC performances :0)"
1,Not worth the time,"Bought two of these cables to add a second SATA drive to my older Dell 8300.The right angle connect was an OK fit to the drive but the straight end was extremely loose on the motherboard.I gave up and bought another one from Best Buy for $20, fit fine and was of much better quality.I guess you get what you pay for....."
2,The angle plug is designed in the wrong side.,"This product is cheap / very affortabe. This is the pros. This is a positive credit for the seller. The seller shipped the product promptly. Another positive.But it is designed wrong on the angle interface - the cable will facing the OUT of the computer case for most of the hard drive mount so that the computers can not close the cover. The angle pins should be reversed so that it points inward toward the computer, not block the case cover.I swapped it with the DVD ROM cable which is internal."
1,Not to be confused with an EXCELLENT book by a great author,"I started the book, and though I felt myself becoming sick pushed on through the entire first chapter.Terrible.I can see why the author wanted to link it to Erskine Childers' book ""Riddle of the Sands"", which was an EXCELLENT book (10 stars).This author attempts to somehow capitalize on anothers work and fails completely.Even to the point of starting the book in the middle of a race and then the ""narrating character"" decides to start from the beginning. I dont know much about the author except for this failure.I would suggest you go read the Riddle Of The Sands again instead."
2,Not for the plain old M1 owner,"This manual was not what I wanted or hoped it would be. I was looking for a manual that would provide a fair amount of detail about how to completely disassemble, clean, lubricate, and reassemble an M1 Garand. This manual is for military ordnance personnel who worked in an ordnance depot on M1's i.e. professionals who are reworking or retrofitting or repairing M1's. It is full of usage of very specialized gages, fixtures, reamers, etc. that the common M1 owner would not have nor likely need for routine disassembly/assembly."
2,Disappointed in size,"According to the description, ""This is not the smaller version that came out later"". I was expecting the full size manual (8 1/2 x 11) like I've owned in the past. I suppose it's the same information, but it wasn't what I expected. I'll keep it for the info it contains, but I'm still looking for the ""correct"" manual."
5,A Must-Have for Michelangelo fans,"...or actually art fans in general. If you have even a passing interest in art, or Michelangelo, this book is a must.For starters, it is an amazing book. The photography is beautiful (if you ever wanted to view this sculpture from every conceivable angle, this is your book!) and the essays are well-written and informative.If that wasn't enough, we get treated to an amazing CD-ROM which details the ""virtual"" sculpture project. Its fascinating and a very well-put-together multimedia item.I had the distinct fortune of seeing this sculpture with my own eyes, and while absolutely nothing can compare to seeing the original, this book comes very close.Jack Wasserman and the staff from IBM Research have done a great service to this masterpiece. I'm sure Michelangelo would've approved. Here's hoping they apply this to other treasures from the art world.Highly recommended."
2,Not Very Well Made...,"This towel is not very thick or absorbant. Some of the stitches are coming out, and it does not look like it will last too long. The quality is lacking. The colour, however, is exactly what is shown in the description."
2,An R-rated mystery for kids under 10?,"I picked up The Case of the Missing Marquess in the library to read aloud to my daughter, who's seven now but has been enjoying mysteries since she was four, when we started reading Nancy Drew to her. On page 3, we read about a (live) prostitute with haggard eyes and another who ""was recently found dead a few streets away, slit wide open."" OK, so we stopped right there. I don't want that image even for myself -- not to mention to have to explain it to a kid and embed it in her very literal imagination. So while the book may be acclaimed by many of its readers and be advertised for kids 9-13, I would *definitely* put the lower limit on this book higher than age 9."
5,Best Sherlock tribute series EVER,"I'm a fan of all things Sherlock, and have read any number of tributes to the Baker Street detectives, mostly those written for adults. Nancy Springer's middle grade mystery series featuring Sherlock and Mycroft's much younger sister Enola is hands-down, my favorite and the one I reread the most often. This installment is the first in the series and follows the smart and stubbornly independent Enola as she slips away from her brothers' well-meaning but odious control to launch her own career as a detective, one who specializes in finding missing things and people. Each book in the series is a complete mystery, but I recommend that you read them in order."
4,Engaging mystery,"****1/2When I picked up this book, it sounded like something that would be slightly flakey and formulaic. After all, the heroine is Sherlock Holmes's much younger sister! However I was gladly mistaken. The author's style of writing grabbed me from the first page and I zoomed through the book, hardly able to set it down!When Mrs. Holmes disappears without a trace or even saying goodbye, it is up to daughter Enola to uncover the sultry clues her mother left her and piece them together using skills her ""logical"" brother Sherlock Holmes would never think of using. Her adventures eventually take her to London where she finally discovers where her place is in the world. The journey along the way is full of interesting characters, disguises and kidnapping. Fast-paced and well-written, the only thing I found disappointing in this book was the main character's belief in Science and chance rather than God."
5,fun to watch,"I gave five stars because this movie is just fun to watch with your friends or not. There is nudity but it's only topless and they did a good job of making it fun, sexy and classy. It is set in a strip club where it's not slutty strippers they do sets with fantastic music and the shows are more avant garde and artistic. The music is really diverse the girls all have their own personalities so all their shows are really different from each other. The movie has a pretty good plot as well. It is not a movie that won awards or had any hype at all no award winners here but just entertaining to watch. I think this movie is more fun to watch than flashdance."
1,Diggin the cratres,"Not the origanal recordings, if your looking for orginal, don't waste your money."
5,pleasing,I found just what I had asked for and expected... Linda in fine flower. Listening to Linda sing 'Rock Me On The Water' truly is a religious experience. Rock On!
1,So far it's a wonderful jacket. A real steal for the price,I originally wrote a glowing review at about the 3 or 4 month mark. 6 months after owning it the wool began to shed around the cuffs really bad.I've learned one thing. When searching for a shearling bomber don't cheap out. Spend the extra cash and get one that will last half a lifetime.I recommend the Alpha Industries B3 sherpa over this thing. I've had it 2 years now and it wears like iron and looks beautiful and could see it lasting a long long time.
3,Great Customer service...not the best quality Jacket.,"You get what you pay for in quality. This jackets cost is far below most jackets with equal description. The inner liner on the jacket was not plush or soft...very thin and it was not one piece...it was patchy. Outside leather was not impressive either. Besides the quality, it didn't fit my thin 15 year old son. The arms are very long. The customer service I got from Bargain Outfitters was outstanding. They made sure I got a return label and accepted the return with no hassle. They were very concerned that I was a satisfied customer regardless of the product. I would shop with the Bargain Outfitters again."
4,Wonderful Product&#128077;&#128077;&#128077;&#128077;,"This product can be used for so many things. I use it for my sons (7months) hair and skin because he has mild eczema. I also use it for my hair as a hot oil treatment , I use it to seal in my oils when I moisturize and seal nightly. I love how it feels on my skin after I shave my legs. This is one of my favorite products and I will be purchasing again. &#128077;&#128525;"
5,what a great product,"I am so glad I made this purchase. Where to start-I had quit eating fried eggs as the taste was bland. To begin with I decided to fry eggs & hash browns. They tasted so good. I haven't gotten to try too many things but I like taste coconut oil gives food. I have also been using it as a makeup remover & moisturizer for over a week now. My skin feels great, some of the laugh lines are reduced on my face & my hands feel so much softer."
4,ONLY PLASTIC CONTAINER,I called the company and they said that their products only come in plastic. That's too bad because I like everything their product has to offer. Bummer.
5,Totally Good,I like this stuff much better than extra virgin olive oil. It cooks better. It tastes better. It is all around healthy for you and requires less fuss than the oil. I love this stuff actually.
5,"Outstanding value, superior taste","We've been buying our coconut oil from Whole Foods as well as other health food markets, but we decided to give Nutiva coconut oil a try mainly because of the price offered on Amazon. To our suprise this oil has exceeded our expectations! It smells wonderful and tastes good too. It is at least on par or superior to the products purchased at Whole Foods and health food stores but at a much lower price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to family and friends, only problem is that most people are still sceptical of the health benefits of coconut oil. When I mention the use of coconut oil, most people just shake their heads and respond that they're not into ""crazy fad diets"". Too bad, their loss."
5,taste good;))),Me like it! The only drawback it's plastic can.Nice seller.Bullet fast delivery.Will buy again
1,Disappointed in container.,Previously purchased this item. It was packaged in a solid white container. Very disappointed they changed it. I think it has an adverse affect on the quality of the product. Doubt I'll purchase again.
3,Extremely strong coconut flavor and odor,"This is a very good quality coconut oil in terms of purity and would be great for making desserts or sweets, but it's not well suited for general cooking as the coconut flavor and odor are overwhelming. I like coconut, but this is simply too much to handle, especially when there are scent-free options available."
5,BEST ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN COCONUT OIL!!!!!!,I have been using this brand since 2003!!!! Best Coconut Oil ever!!!!Organic...NO GMOs...No Hexane...JUST Pure Coconut Oil!!!! Thanks Nutiva...Thanks Amazon..Thanks Vitacost!!!!!
5,Fantastic,"Very delicious and fresh coconut oil. I use it for baking and for blending in shakes, and as spreading on bread with sugar free jam."
5,Fantastic!!,I love this!! I use coconut oil as moisturizer for my skin and hair. I don't suffer from dry skin anymore. My daughter's hair has a grown over a inch after using about 3 weeks.
3,Cheapest available...at the time,"I purchased this item because it was the best value for a large quantity of coconut oil that I was going to use to make sugar scrubs for my family. The consistency of the oil is perfectly fine, but there is definitely more of an odor to it than the other organic oil that I purchased at Target.My local Costco now sells the same size container of coconut oil for MUCH less than I paid here, so I will be trying that one next."
5,The Best,"Can't live without this stuff. I've tried others, this smells so fresh and good, you know it's quality. Only thing I would change would be the plastic container it comes in. Glass would be better, i hope it's not absorbing anything from the plastic."
5,great product,I use this for making homemade balms and this works perfectly. I was ill definitely buy again and recommend to others !
5,Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil,This is absolutely the best coconut oil that I have purchased. I use it for everything that I cook. It has a pleasing coconut smell also. I have purchased other coconut oil from retail stores that is more like shortening and absolutely no coconut smell.
5,Search no further.,"Researching and testing other brands brought me here. No hype, no dogma, no excuses. Fantastic for ALL food prep, doesn't burn and easy cleaning. Works such wonders on the body nothing else even compares. Nutiva is a conscious, accessible company that delivers great customer service. One fantastic find!"
5,Nutia Coconut Oil,We have used it for popping our popcorn and it taste great. This is the first coconut oil we have used and we do like it better than other oils.
5,Healthy Option,"This is a great healthy product at a good price. Not the first time I buy it, and not the last."
4,Nutiva Coconut Oil - change in bottling?,"I was happy with the quick delivery time of this product. I ordered one bottle last month, and was pleased enough that I ordered three more. However, this recent order came with all three items being packaged in plastic jars, whereas the first was in a glass jar. I prefer the glass, which is why I ordered again. However, the shipping was fast and the quality of the oil appears to be the same. Overall happy with product, but will seek out glass jars in future."
4,Perfect for Hair,"I use this oil as a pre-shampoo treatment.I put it all over my hair, throw on a scarf and leave it in overnight. Even the gentlest shampoos can dry out my hair but when I put this in then shampoo my hair stays moisturized and I can still get it clean. I'm still exploring other uses for it but for right now I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Nutiva Organic Coconut Coconut Oil,"Great for hair, skin and inside too. I will buy when this used up. It tastes like an Almond Joy candy bar without the chocolate."
5,Where Have You Been?!?,WOW!!! I cannot believe that I have lived 45 years without this product. The difference it has made on my skin and hair (externally) is nothing short of amazing. I have not noticed any changes in our dog's skin (ingesting) but I have only started them on it! I am immediately putting this product on auto delivery.
5,Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil,"I use coconut oil as a hair conditioner, but have also used very high quality coconut oil for cooking. This one is perfect for both. It remains a liquid, whereas some coconut oils become a solid, even here in Florida. Some have no smell, but this one has a very light coconutty smell which is wonderful. If I put it on my hair, it doesn't overwhelm me. I love the product, appreciated the good service, and will order it again."
5,LOVE IT,"I love me some coconut oil!!! This shipped really quickly and is exactly as pictured. Great quality oil, and perfect for so many uses! I use it in my daughters hair, as she has some super curly hair that can be very tricky sometimes."
5,Product was as advertised,"This product was as advertised, cold pressed, extra virgin coconut oil. The consistancy was good, it arrived promptly for Ground Shipping. I ordered two continers, and take four table spoons per day. I have a low level of type 2 Diabetes, and my blood suger level has dropped noticeably. Not a cure, but a help."
5,The Best!,"This is a great product! Delicious, pure and the best coconut oil I have ever used. I like the fact that it's certified organic."
5,Good quality,"Love this stuff. I use it for everything. Awesome in the kitchen (especially in brownies!), great in the bathroom for a hair mask. I buy this all the time!"
5,Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil,"Repeat customer. I've yet to try another brand of coconut oil but I love this Nutiva so far. Vitamin Shoppe is a great vendor, prompt communication, prompt everything. $.99 ship is great!"
5,Best buy on Amazon,"I have been convinced that organic coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils to cook with and my good health (I'm over 50) is a testament to my incorporating it into my diet. My cholesterol count actually went down (it was high) after I cut out all oils and fats except olive, coconut and butter (oh - and grape seed oil from Trader Joe's)!So, I purchase coconut oil regularly. Nutiva is excellent. It has a nice clean, coconut scent, but it doesn't make everything taste like coconut. Coconut oil is also a great body oil - I keep a little container of it in the shower and use it daily. Much better than those chemical-filled and perfume-y lotions.The price that Amazon is offering coconut oil for, though, can't be beat (especially if you have the Prime shipping)."
4,great,Product is great ....Very good and taste coconut oil . Shipping was speedee . Only rated 4 stars because the Packing was poore and oil had leaked in side of envelope that was in the box . I am sure this wouldnt have happen if I ordered when the weather was cool . I will buy from this vender again .
5,Deal,"I bought this item because of the healthy reputation of the product. I like to make popcorn in oil and I do usually cook something in oil about once a week. I can tell you that this is honestly the best oil I have ever used. It smells terrific and makes the food taste great. My popcorn is light and fluffy like hot air popcorn, but has a nice rich taste like oil cooked popcorn. When you open the container you are greeted with a terrific coconut smell. For those of you who do not like coconut, it does not stay with the food once you heat it up. Amazon is the place to buy this, the price is outstanding and this size will last you a long time."
3,haven't decided if it is wowrth it,"I received the product without incident. I just am not convinced that it is with any merit. I don't feel any different, my sugar levels remain the same. I guess time will tell. I don't think i would recommend purchasing this product."
1,Deceived!,"I ordered this brand ONLY because it stated that it was in a JAR. I got a white, opaque tub, disfigured, from what I suppose was due to multiple liquifying, then solidifying. I could have gotten it cheaper and faster but chose this for the supreme qualities of glass. The oil tastes okay, but I have doubts about what else might be in it. Even the photo appears to be glass. What a con!"
3,Coconut Oil,This product is supposed to be very good for you. But you need to make sure that you like coconut flavor...because it will add a little coconut flavor to your food. It is a little annoying that you have to melt the oil everytime you want to use it. But if you want the health benefits it is worth it. I haven't used it long enough to recognize any changes or benefits in my health.
3,"I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications","I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable. Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated. Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve. I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up."
5,Great Stuff,"The coconut oil smelled like coconut and had no taste. It cooks well and and looks like lard but is healthier. I noticed when I used it for cooking that it adds a coconut scent to the food, so be careful if you don't want the smell on a certain food."
5,Great product,"I always keep one or two containers on hand. I love the flavor and coconut oil is very healthy unlike canola, soybean, or vegetable oils."
5,NUTIVA COCONUT OIL,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT EVERY DAY ALONG WITH COD LIVER OIL FOR 7 MONTHS. DRY AND DAMAGED SKIN FROM THE SUN HEALED IN 2 MONTHS. I TRIED FOR 35 YEARS TO HEAL MY DAMAGED LEGS BUT NOTHING WORKED AND THEN THIS!!!IT HAS ALSO GIVEN ME A FEELING OF WELL BEING. I FEEL THAT I AM DOING SOMETHING GOOD FOR MYSELF.
5,best purshase yet!!,"I bought this product a little affraid that my results on using it on skin or hair wasn't going to be the same or even close to those who talked great about it, well the joke is on me because it is amazing and it leaves my skin and hair soft all day, I don't eat it because I wouldn't like for it to give me any side effects, not that I've heard of any so far but I don't want to risk it. I recommend this product 100% to all that want beautiful sof skin and shiny and sof hair."
5,Best oil for hair,"According the research online, the coconut oil work great on hair. It is the only oil reported to penetrate the hair shaft and leaves hair soft/moistened. I use the oil as a pre-conditioner for 30 min or longer no heat. Then followed by shampoo. After shampoo I apply again the coconut oil other oils to seal the oil in the hair. The product is cost effective, natural, and most importantly does the work."
5,Amazing Oil,"I think I will always use coconut oil from now on. It is just amazing. Since I can't get oil in Istanbul, I actually wish I had bought more of it. This brand of coconut oil is smooth, creamy, and sooooo delicious."
4,Satisfied,I use this product as a skin oil. I don't like the taste of coconuts so the smell was a bit to overcome initially (more potent than previous brand I used); but I got used to it
5,Nutiva Coconut Oil,"I've been using this for over a month now, things I have noticed; my face seems to be getting clearer, it suppresses my appetite/desire for sweets and it's helping me to lose weight. I've also been giving it to our dog, hoping it would help her with her skin allergies, but I don't think it has done much in that department. I will still continue to give it to her, though, as I've read the many other benefits that it can help her with.I prefer to have it when it's in its' melted stage & I just mix it with some fruit and it taste great that way. It is a bit on the pricey side, but I think compared to other vitamin supplements, etc. it is well worth the money."
5,The Best,This is my favorite source for Organic Coconut Oil thus far! Nutiva is a great company doing really great things!
1,Not as advertised,We have used this brand for months and this is the first time we have been disappointed. Seemed like refined coconut oil not Extra Virgin.
4,Coconut Oil,"I have been using coconut oil for cooking, baking, and just spreading on toast & vegetables for about a year. My whole family and friends are hooked on it. It is so delicious and it is very good for you too! I had to start buying it in this larger size because we were using up the 1 pound size so quickly. It lasts for years too, so no worry about it going bad. It just makes more sense to buy this size and save money. I still buy the smaller size to take with me on vacations. Wouldn't be without it!! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though this brand is very good, I have tasted some that is even better. But the price of this is very good. Thank you for carrying it on your site!"
4,Great product for baking,"I use this for all my baking needs. When it's hard at room temp, I just cut it into the dry goods before adding the liquids."
5,Great product!,I use this for everything- from cooking to hair care to body care. It is truly an all round product. My 4yr old daughter loves it on her hair which by the way has completely cleared a dry scaly festering wound she had on her scalp. Her hair is so soft (we are Africans by the way) and it tastes great when added to noodles and the likes.We love it!
4,Great product!!!,I used the Nutiva Organic Coconut oil and it was Great. I replaced it when I made the egg shaped rice krispies treat for Easter. The kids ate them up and I also make them in a pan and used the coconut oil to coat the pan. Thanks again for a great product.
4,Great product,"Coconut oil has helped to lower my cholesterol dramatically in only a few months, along with other dietary changes. The only problem with this product is that it is packaged in plastic rather than glass, so I might not buy it again from this company. The supplier/shipper also poorly wrapped the jar for shipping."
4,Nutiva organic coconut oil,"This is a really nice value, and a delicious product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread."
4,perfect product,I have enjoyed using this product. It is as advertized and seems to be the perfect quantity for a beginners usage.
5,"Coconutty, mmmmmm.","The oil was just right, very good texture/smell. Great size- it's a two hander. Works not only as a supplement, but also as a moisturizer for skin/hair as well. This oil is mild, not overwhelming in the least when used as a butter substitute or while cooking; you really can eat this straight off the spoon if you're so inclined. I was able to convince a skeptical man and two little ones to eat this. They love it and request it when given a choice between butter or oil. It's worth a try and there is a multitude of research in support of the health benefit(s) from adrenal/thyroid to dental maintenance... This has got to be one of the most painless ways to eat healthier."
5,GREAT!,I use this on my morning oatmeal and I use it in cooking. Wonderful flavor! Excellent value for your money.
5,Completely Satisfied,"I have been enjoying my Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. I am on a moderate low-carb food plan, and it fits right in to a healthy diet. I use it for sauteing,for making a low-carb chocolate candy, in a low-carb molten chocolate cake, as a spread, and I use it for a moisturizer on my skin. I also thought this is a good value for my money. I'm completely satisfied with it."
4,Tasty but not the best,"I just received this product. While the smell and taste are nice, I still prefer the brand Spectrum for the richest taste and smoothest oil. The Nutiva Coconut Oil is a bit grainy and doesn't have the intense flavor and fragrance of Spectrum. I'm not sure if that is indicative of better processing, a higher quality coconut, or what. At any rate, we go through a lot of it, and the price for this is hard to beat."
3,Great multi-use product,"I have purchased this exact product elsewhere & have yet to find this great of a deal! Nutiva tastes & smells amazing!! I truly appreciate the option to ""auto ship"" too. I use this oil from cooking, to hair care, to skin care...love it!"
2,Not For Me!,This product to me isn't all that great! It's high in Saturated Fat and I really don't see the what the hype is around this product! For me it's another fad that I bought into and wasted more money...check out my YouTube review to see my reaction to this product. [...]
3,Coconut taste too pronounced,"I prefer the Spectrum coconut oils. Because they are flavorless, they have more potential uses."
5,Coconut Oil is Magic for Cloth Diaper Mommas!,Coconut oil is fantastic used as diaper cream for cloth diaper mommas. I add a little bit of coconut oil after messy diaper changes or when my little man looks irritated and it clears things up quickly. It's safe for cloth diapers and smells fantastic.
5,Nutiva organic coconut oil,"Love this. Great substitute for shortening. Keeps baked goods moister, and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables."
5,Great Taste!,"Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds.I tried several different brands. I like this one a lot.I am not a big fan of coconut flavor, but this one smells different. It's preasant.Just 54-ounce jar was too big. I didn't have a sense of US unit. I recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often.You'll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream."
5,Fantastic product,"Love Nutiva! one of the very good quality coconut oil in the market. The 1 gallon can is a good one to buy if you want to save some money however, i have also seen they have a residual in the bottom (usually discolored brown), not sure why. I usually scoop it and throw it away. Not seen them in the 54 oz jars."
5,Cakes taste better.,"This product is very useful in all my baking and frying. I've found that it adds wonderful flavor and moistness to my baked goods, and is also very good on my dry hands."
3,A Slow Start to the Series,"This is the first book in Geary's Victorian Murder series, and while its kind of a fun little read, its just not long enough nor does it have enough detail. The first two stories are not fleshed out enough, and while the third is much better, it still falls way short of his later installments into the series.If you want to finish out your collection and can find it on sale, pick it up, but don;t expect a lot. His other books are much better then this one."
3,UH...WHAT??,"Ok so im a little confused, I was just about to buy the book until I read the reviews. The book was written as Jesminder and her friend were suppost to fall in love. The reason why the director changed it in the movie was just to not piss off the indian community. So is this based on the movie or is the actual book? because in the actual book it is about a lesbian teen"
5,Nice Book to Read,This book was about indian girl who met a fan of american girls soccer team and had trouble with her family to play the game that she liked since she was a child. she did everything possible to join soccer girls team to train and be more professional at that game that took her to travel to Europe to play soccer. I had good time reading this book.
4,"If you liked the movie, you'll love the book!",It reads like a movie script that has you recreating characters' emotions and motivations.
2,Dracula and Frankenstein,Am a college English teacher. Was hoping to show film in upcoming English class -- as part of my theme. Was not expecting R-rating. Now am not so sure I want to show it.
5,I Agree,"I agree with the kid who wrote the last review. These are exceptionally well done films and are very faithful to the novels. The performances are all exceptional (save for some of Winona Ryder's British accent in Dracula)with perfect casting. I also have the same complaints : 'Where are the special features?' and 'Why is Frankenstein in FULLSCREEN only? Why must studios screw good movies over in just Fullscreen (Moonstruck)? Couldn't it just as easily been widescreen or both(also Moonstruck)?' And yes, Dracula does need a new menu doesn't it?P.S.- I highly reccomend the film WOLF, just as the kid who wrote the last review did. It is sleek and intelligent (just like the box says!) and is also filled with exceptional performances."
4,It's a classic,"We haven't watched Frankenstein yet, but we mostly ordered it for dracula anyway, Frankenstein was just kinda a bonus. Dracula was really good, I hadn't seen it in a while, and it was every bit as strange and perverse as I remember it, which should be descriptive words of any respectable horror movie! Want a horror movie that's not terrifying (like things jumping out at you every few minutes), but not too corny? This movie is for you!"
2,Not practical,Every single listing reads like an advertisement. You also have to be very wealthy to stay at the places listed. Not very practical
4,surprisingly louch,"Certainly won't replace a home alarm system, but gives me a little piece of mind, louder than I thought they would be."
1,I was unhappy with this purchase.,The batteries were corroded and I had to scrape of the corrosion and replace the batteries before I could get them to work. I was unable to get all four of them to work. I did not know how to return them or who to contact about this product and I was not going to spend more money to send them back so I kept them. I was unhappy with this purchase.
1,Bell Howell sonic,"Horrible item, I now know why they no longer sell at the stores. Only one out of the four in the pack worked. Some were cracked, this was my worst purchase ever."
4,the voice of an angel,"Iz is a beloved treasure to the Hawaiians and to the rest of us (some of whom would like to be Hawaiian.) His voice is pure, his music reflects the Hawaiian culture in the best possible way. We have all his music and feel so bad that there will never be anymore. He is irresplacable. I have friends who live in Hawaii who knew him and who have told me that he was the nicest and kindest man. He was totally down to earth and is truly missed. I like to think that now he is a real angel."
2,An acquired taste,"And I haven't acquired it as a result of this CD. I like Iz's Facing Future CD much better. This one is a one-cut CD (the first cut is good, the rest is dreck)."
5,The CD that started my love for modern Hawaiian Music,"I was visiting O'ahu in 1999 for my first visit back after moving away as a child. While searching the CD rack at the Bishop Museum for music that would help me 'feel' Hawaii, I suddenly realized that the music playing over the speakers was exactly what I was looking for. The young man at the counter showed me a CD by IZ (Isreal Kamakawiwo'ole), then suggested 'E Ala E', since it was his own favorite. I bought it, and when I got back to Utah I couldn't stop listening to it. I now have over 100 Hawaiian CD's - mostly purchased over the internet. I rate the quality of the music by how strongly I feel Hawaii when I listen to it, and ""IZ"" is one of the best. He may have passed on - but he will always live on in the hearts of his many fans (past, present and future!) through his music."
5,The best cd,"He is such a soul singer. A person that lives in Hawaii, and grew up with his singing. I love it. The song Somewhere Over the Rainbow is such a popular song. ""Finding Forester"" even played this song at the end of the movie. The etoy Comercials play this song to. I wish IZ Was still alive making music."
4,Great price!,"This is just what I needed, almost. My only issue (and I'm sure it's more of an issue with Plantronics than the seller) is that I couldn't get just the size I wanted. I needed the replacement because my ear bud fell off my headset and got lost. I would prefer to have 3 of the size that I use rather than buy 1 replacement and 2 buds I don't need. I do appreciate the low price and quick shipping."
4,can't find THESE at best buys!,"Tried to find these ear buds at every local electronics business in Chico. Always got the same story... ""ummm, we just sell the bluetooth unit."" So... I did the next best thing. I ordered from Amazon and saved a bundle of cash and got them in 4 days. Amazon is the electronics culture's ""Wal Mart"". LoL"
5,Glad to find these.,Glad to find these aren't to expensive to replace. Just wish they didn't come off so easily.
4,Happy ears,"So glad I didn't have to buy a new bluetooth, excellent product just like the ones that came with original order, quick service. only 4 stars because the pkg. contains 3 sizes and of course, by the time you have to replace them, you only need one size. Like others have said, to bad you can't purchase by size. I'll just find someone with big ears to pass along too."
2,Bad marketing,"It makes lots of sense when you purchase the headset to include three different sizes of earbuds. You get to choose which one fits best. But once you know that and want to order replacements, it makes NO SENSE to ship three different sizes. You should be able to order the replacement size you want and get three of them.The current marketing strategy is inefficient (for the consumer), wastes resources (you throw away the two incorrect sizes), and expensive (you pay for three, only to use one).Come on Plantronics, you make great headsets, you can do a much better job of consumer supplies."
1,this is soooo expensive,"i lost the original set and needed the replacement. if i can do it all over again, i wouldn't buy a bluetooth headset and instead stick with the corded headset since i only use it when i'm in the car anyway."
3,Plantronics ear buds,Once again I'm in the need of a replacement ear bud from Plantronics. The parts are great. It's just that I have to purchase 3 to a pack and they are all different sizes. What a waste of resources. One of them being my money and time. I'd rather by 6 of the right size than 3 with only one the correct size. Sure glad shoes come in pairs!
3,Plantronics ear tips,The ear tips on the Plantronics Discovery wear out and come lose after many uses. This kit includes 3 sizes of tips. I can only use one size so i wish they would sell 3 of the same size in a pack.
4,Satisfied,"I just wish I could have purchased 3 of the same size instead of having to purchase one of each size (S, M & L)."
4,FOR DANSTITUTES ONLY,"Easily the most consistently good Cerrone album: this is what we really shook our groove things to back in the 1970's. Enough has already been said about Supernature, but the compelling rhythms of Give Me Love are usually overlooked and Love Is Here must have spawned a million self-help books-you can't do anything other than dance and smile to this wonderful tune. If you love this, you must find Don Ray-Got To Have Lovin'"
5,The best work of Cerrone,"Cerrone's ""Supernature"" is a truly fantastic cd! From the first track, you can hear his typical, rich groove, with electronic, hi-nrg oriented sounds, as well as disco beats and classic bass lines. The best track, for me is ""Give Me Love"", here presented in the original 1977's long version. A must-have for any Cerrone fan!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!!,One the great dance albums... but whomever re-worked the tapes has altered it to the point where the vinyl record actually sounds better. The first part of the opening number is gone all together. The overall sound of this re-release has been either equalized wrong or was over compressed. Please spare your money and pass on this. Try to find Cerrone 3 by another production house. It's too bad that a great dance album has it's feel and completeness dissected by someone who does not understand the work.
4,Superdisco,"When you hear Supernature for the first time,you will know it is not really the first time. It's beat and arrangements and melody will just make you dance (even if you don't want to). It's a must-have disco classic. It's still a hit. Here in Brazil it is very well known by expertise DJs and a very hard to find CD (I have it in record LP). Don't skip tracks, just press the play button and fasten your seat belt. Have a nice take-off (or should I say blast or space trip or whatever). Cheers from Brazil."
5,This book was all I hoped it would be!,"After having three children in six years of marriage, my husband and I agree that we know HOW to have sex. But our sexual experience had become almost mechanical, and we wanted to re-ignite the spark we felt in the beginning of our relationship. This book was the perfect tool. The tone was neither too ""clinical"" nor too ""raunchy"", and the exercises were easy to understand and implement (not to mention fun!). The text was also accompanied by very tasteful erotic photographs. I highly recommend this book - you will not be dissapointed!"
5,lots of advice to expand the possibilities of reader's own love lives,"Barbara Keesling's sex and relationship book, Sexual Pleasure (2nd ed., 2005), is a great book for both women and men, with lots of practical advice and over one hundred exercises, some specifically for men or for women, many for both. I especially liked her clear expression of the importance and exercising of the PC muscles for men and women. She not only deals nicely with the G-spot orgasm and female ejaculation (a favorite of mine), but also brings new research results about three other female sexual arousal centers: the A-spot, U-spot, and X-spot.

4,"Single, sexually frustrated and enjoyed it a lot!","I really enjoyed this book! I've been looking for a training manual for my penis for a long time and this one is the best I've found so far. I believe the exercises have been helpful. When I find the right woman I will be prepared to give her so much of myself, she will die in my body. Barbara provides very good male exerices for my sensitive and reasonable hang. There should be more books like this for males who want to keep there sexual staying power.The only missing thing, and for that reason, missing from ALL similar books, is a list of food and drink that will keep my pride and joy, health and in habitual motion without taking those pills and other crap I get in my SPAM folder that probably will hurt me.I hope she comes out with another book like this... being bias... for males."
2,Not much to it,I did not think this book was very good. I have been married for 2 years and I did not learn anything new from this book. I would say that over half the book and most of the exercieses are about how to play with yourself. For those of us that are not into that this is not a good book (Besides I wanted a book about sex not masturbation). Some of the exercieses are good but they seem to repeat themself and not expand on anything. It does teach some good stuff about self control which you can learn from but not very good for a beginner and not much there for the advanced. If you have even a little imagination and common sense you should be able to figure most of this out on your own.
2,Didn't do much for me,"This book definitely doesn't fall into the ""playful ideas to spice up a decade-old marriage"" category. The series of exercises, with the writer's continual admonitions to NOT skip any, because they MUST be done in order, made it seem more like math homework for a class you wish you had remembered to drop in time. Too much work and not enough fun, yuk."
4,Do Bother At All,"Koufax is a great band, and to get a free downloaded song of this caliber is a steal. It is much more upbeat then what I have heard of them in earlier albums, but it is a great song. Give it a listen."
5,Great All Around Book,"This book is excellent! I have been crocheting for many years and yet still find myself wanting new things to learn. This book covers a lot of techniques and gives you clear directions and great close up photos of each step. There is plenty of room for you to be creative with the ideas. If you are just learning or want to pick up a new stitch, this is a great book to get. It also encludes several versions of the same stitch to make projects more individual."
3,Opteka 90 degree mirror lens,Opteka Voyeur Right Angle Spy Lens for Canon EOS was tested only once and seems to work well if used with the telephoto for distant scenes.
2,A great idea with limited lens compatibility.,"I had this on my wish list for a while so was a little disappointed to find it worked on only 52mm and 58mm filter size and tried it on my kit lens on my Rebel XTi. It only works around 50m on a zoom lens otherwise you see the edges of it and a small circle of viewing area. I think it is meant to use on a prime lens but this makes truly clandestine shooting limited. I then got a 62-58mm step-down ring and put it on my new tamron 18-250mm lens. It rotates with the autofocus and takes a LOT of getting used to but i was able to shoot some closeups of people's faces across the room in a diner without being noticed. For the cost it is of VERY good quality but in reality, only good for specific applications where you can do a lot of planning. On the run, forget it. You have to really do a lot of adjusting and the focal length where it works is limited."
2,"On the run, forget it","I tried it on my kit lens on my Rebel XT and I am disappointed, when I take a shoot I find that it show the edges of it and a small circle of viewing area beside It rotates with the autofocus and takes a LOT of adjusting to getting used to and a lot of planning. On the run, forget it. You have to really do a lot of adjusting and the focal length where it works is limited."
2,poor service,It is unfortunate that the dimensions for this product were not given. It does NOT fit all Canon EOS cameras and certainly didn't fit mine. There was no invoice in the box when it arrived. I called the company (after much research to get a telephone number) to get info to return the lens and was promised a return sticker by mail. That was almost a month ago and I am still waiting.
2,too hard to focus to be useful,"the lens is to hard to use, to get things in focus is extremly hard specially because it rotates when you try to focus and you loose the item you are trying to get in focus to begin with, also you would have to be far away for someone not to notice the hole in the lens side, i have another opteka lens and i am very happy with it, but these is just to complicated to use"
1,The XBOX won't reconize it as hig res.,I had the same problem as the other reviewer. The issue is that the Xbox isn't reconizing it as a HD signal so it won't give you the options for the HD. So you can see a picture but it's crappy loking and not high res. I'd say pass on this unless you really just need SOMETHING.

3,"A little long, not enough top material.","I'm a Concrete Blonde from the start in 1986. But on this their 5th album ""Mexican Moon"" #67, they thought let's put on a hours worth of music (so many bands fell into this trap back in the early to mid 90's), sometimes you overload an album, and this is one of them. They still made some good music here, but that had too much filler here. (MHO). The songs I really liked were, ""Jenny I Read"", ""Heal It Up"", #16 modern rock, a real charmer, Johnette at her best. The title track a very sensual tune and their take on the Jim Jones massacre, on the fuzzy ""Jonestown"". After that things got a little murky, even The Dream Syndicate cover ""When You Smile"", seems lackluster as is the Roxy Music cover ""End Of The Line"". They broke up after this album and reformed again in 2001 for ""Group Therapy"", which they turned up the volume a little more, but still couldn't relive past triumphs, another 3 star release."
5,TEN stars out of five!!,"Not only CONCRETE BLONDE's best album ever,but one of the 10 cd's i'd take to an island...And I've got more that 5.000 (cd's, not islands)I was lucky enough to meet Johnette in person to let her know."
4,Intriguing rock CD,"I have several CD's by Concrete Blonde, but I have to admit that I don't know that much about them. I do, however, know they make some really good music. This CD has almost a mystical feel and reminds me of being in the Southwest desert. As suggested by the title, the CD also seems to be influenced by Mexico. The song, MEXICAN MOON, is one of their best songs ever (along with ""Joey,"" from ""Bloodletting""). I also like the Spanish version included here, which sounds quite different. I also really love HEAL IT UP, and Johnette Napolitano really wails on it in a primal kind of way. In addition, there are a couple of great ballads, including (LOVE IS A) BLIND AMBITION. Overall, a top-notch alt-rock CD. MEXICAN MOON was the group's last CD for awhile (they released a CD in 2002 that I haven't heard yet), and it's one to be thoroughly enjoyed."
2,"disappointed, flimsy","I was disappointed with this book - it's more of an ""optical illusion"" kit with a little book inside of the kit. There are examples of optical illusions - but the book itself is small and you'll find bigger more comprehensive books elsewhere (e.g. Al Seckel). There are also some 3-D images and 3-D glasses but the pics were very marginal - i've seen much better. Then there are some other plastic and cardboard odds and ends to attempt your own illusions - but all these ""spare parts"" look flimsy and look like items will be easily lost, broken, or not perform adequately. I had hoped to use this for a Kindergarten class but there is no way it would hold up to young children. I was much more pleased with the quality of a book by Al Seckel and would encourage others to check his books out instead."
2,Bastard Life or Clarity,"I am a serious Russell Crowe fan. As an actor, he's right up there with Alec Guinness in his ability to play any type. As a singer, he's ordinary, as is this album. There are a couple of nice trumpet riffs, but you've got to admit that Crowe hits quite a few flat notes. The lyrics are banal, the music undistinguished. After listening a few times, I took this to my local music store as a trade-in."
5,Bastard Life Or Clarity,I was skeptical about buying an album of a band I had never heard before but I'm glad I purchased this one. I was pleasantly surprised. Russell puts a lot of emotion and love into the songs. He allows his fans a little peak into his heart. I await the next album.
5,FANTASTIC,"This CD was such a pleasant surprise. The songs stick in your head, I find myself singing them over and over again throughout the day. I cannot wait to see them play live. Russell Crowe writes great lyrics, is a gifted singer as well as actor."
4,That voice...what more can I say!!,"Of course I bought this CD, not because I am a fan of 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, but because I am a huge Russell Crowe fan. What I found was an enjoyable CD made moreso by the fact that Russell Crowe is singing. If his speaking voice sends shivers down your spine, then his singing voice will send you over the top. You can't help but visualize Russell in your mind, while he is singing, only adding to the experience. From the music standpoint, my favorites are ""Sail Those Same Oceans"", ""Wendy"", and ""Judas Car"". All have interesting and perhaps meaningful lyrics, but again I have to admit that it is Russell's voice that makes this CD a must have."
5,Bastard Life Or Clarity,"I thoroughly enjoy this CD. I've been a fan of TOFOG for a little over a year and would recommend it to everyone. It has a wonderful mixture of songs, from rock n roll to blues. The songs are infectious! Russell Crowe's vocals are deep, mellow and wonderful. Dean Cochran's guitar playing is exceptional! The whole band works together like a well tuned engine. This CD is a must have!"
3,"good CD, better live","The CD is better than most people expect. But for me it was just a tease for the concert I went to at the Fillmore in San Fransisco, Ca. Buy it, learn the words then go to a concert and sing along. He rocks much harder live."
5,Who knew Russell could sing and play good music!,"This is the first album of Russell Crowe I have ever bought and it is very very good. The music is very plesant, easy to listen to and well done. This album is not just for Russell's fans as the music is excellent, but in case if you are looking for his performance, he is signing most of the songs. I would buy the rest of their albums if I could find the source. Have fun listening!"
2,Sputtering flame,"Music is one of the rare forms of expression in which a good story can be found, IF it's told right. A story usually has a point and is often told so that the listener/reader is uplifted. The lyrics on this CD DO have a point, but I felt like a deflated balloon afterward. If the story is sung and accompanied by instruments, it should have a flow and rhythm to it, which is really lacking in this case. Russells' musical voice isn't bad, but some music notes elude the guy. The notes hardly ever stray further than a heartbeat from its flatline.. seems like they're missing a few strings from their guitars as well. I'll take musical notes for $1000 Alex. There's a whole range of octaves yet for these guys to discover. If their music was food, I'd say it had the pep of an unsalted peanut, edible but bland. They have potential, but don't buy it if your on prozac. Makes for a good sleep aid though."
5,Forget that it's Russell...,"This is NOT just a movie star making an album. This is true, down to earth rock band with a pub/bar sound. The band features not only the usual cast of musicians, but also some awesome horns. The tunes are singable, danceable, and an intriguing mix of soulful thoughts and storytelling. Get it, enjoy it and read the lyrics - they are beautiful!!"
4,Pretty good album,"With an album coming from someone known for his acting, you might be surprised to hear this one. The songs are good. They are straight forward and honest, especially ""The Legend of Barry Kable"" and ""Memorial Day"". The music is a little bit country and a little bit rock."
3,I was anticipating more....,"I bought this CD based on Russell Crowe and also having friends in Australia, however, I was disappointed in the music. The lyrics are absolutely fantastic. The music on some songs, like ""Hold You"", are forced with not enough to hold the song together like having horns play in ""Things have Got to Change"". Is this band going toward the route of country western, or light bar room? My friends in Australia stated the CD is not all that good and I didn't believe them at first, but, I can see why. I just hope TOFOG didn't bet on having this CD succeed due to Russell Crowe, who sings very well, as a member."
1,Who Are These People?,"That 46 reviewers (as of this writing) would give this thing an average of 4.5 stars certainly proves that there is no accounting for taste. It is quite clear that Mr. Crowe cannot sing. Whatever these sounds are he's making on this cd, no reasonable person could call it singing. Maybe it's some form of performance art. Why people would be willing to listen to this recording, much less purchase it and then praise it in reviews, is a complete mystery to me. Obviously I just don't understand great art and great artists."
3,Bastard Life or Clarity,"Like a few others, I found my way to this album by way of the movies, and bought it out of curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised to find a collection of styles that can't really be defined as any one thing. Some of the stories told in these songs are pretty, some are not. The characters are realistic, people any of us could meet and care about in the course of our lives.The little differences in the way the language is used compared to here in the states, caught my interest. I love the ""accent"" (I know, to these guys, we sound funny). There is a gritty emotional quality to the lyrics which suggests the writers are keen observers of human behavior. It's different - I liked it!"
5,Russell - Amazing,"I loved this CD. I listen to it all the time. I love how it uses a horn. It really adds something to the music. And, there are so many varieties/styles. Where has this been all my life?"
4,A Solid Effort,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Crowe as a singer, but was pleasantly surprised. I found myself enjoying most of the tracks, specifically ""Things Have Got to Change"" and ""Sail Those Same Oceans."" Definitely worth a look."
3,Not my favorite TOFOG album,"I picked up my first TOFOG album, Gaslight, in Sydney in 2000. I was really truly impressed. But Bastard Life or Clarity just didn't meet up to the expectations of the first album...and I prefer the Gaslight versions of 'The Legend of Barry Kable' and 'Wendy'."
2,Basic Primer on Asia Pacific,"Clearly the only reason Mr. Dobbs-Higginson wrote this book was to include the lengthy introduction explaining to the reader what a cool guy he is. Otherwise, it is a basic primer that devotes a chapter to each of the major countries in Asia. A useful introduction to the region perhaps."
3,Standard Reference that Breaks Stereotypes,"Today we incline to see the Puritans as a bunch of spoilsports. But they must have been inspiring in some way, or why would so many people have flocked to join them, and fought to stay with them? They flourished, which is not the usual result of mere grouching. And we ourselves, while we make ""Puritan"" an insult, search for purity in many things, from nutrition to pleasure. Knappen's book on the rise of Puritanism, in the England of the Tudors four centuries ago, has been a standard reference over fifty years. He is more interested in asking questions than in casting blame. This is not to say we ought to be Puritans. But we should do well to study what they were."
3,"Not her best, but it put her on the map","Here it is, her premiere release. It's a cheesy, 80s bubblegum pop album with some RnB mixed into it, so much that in fact, a lot of people in the early 80s thought that she was African-American. This CD does include some of her big hits, like ""Everybody"", ""Burning Up"", and ""Lucky Star""."
3,the start of Madonna,"unless you want the original version of Holiday, Borderline and Lucky Star which the Immaculate Collection does not have, then get this one, otherwise dont bother, the edited version in Immaculate collection are good enough!the original versions on this album are too long, (up to 5 and 6 minutes, you'll get sick of listening to repetitve lyrics and beats....)though, this album has forgotten hits like Everybody and Burning Up, they are very good tooI wouldn't spend money on this one, just get the mp3 of those songs, if you are a fan, and want to collect madonna's CDs, start from True Blue, the real Madonna begins from there!!!"
4,An excellent debut album,"Madonna kicked off a great music career with this stellar debut album. A dance record by all means, Madonna introduces herself as a great dance recording artist. This is definitely one of her best albums. ""Lucky Star"" and ""Holiday"" are by far two of the best pop records ever."
4,ALMOST perfect reissue...,"Not only does this rerelease sound great and fix the problem with Everybody--the version was originally faded a minute early on the vinyl LP, and is here restored to its entirety--but it also gives us the 12"" version of Burning Up and Lucky Star. So what's missing? The 12"" version of Borderline, and the track Ain't No Big Deal, which was a song that never made it on the original LP, but was later released on the b-side of the True Blue single. That would have made this the COMPLETE Madonna debut rerelease."
5,love madonna!,I love madonna and her music. you can hear her maturity grow through her music and her voice.
3,Lucky Star Shines Brightly Enough to Foresee Her Decades to Come,"Back in the early 80s, Madonna had already been a good songwriter; more importantly, she had also been a good collaborator. Unlike many singer-songwriters with strong egos, she left much space for Producer Reggie Lucas to make her debut album; she even sang several songs written by the others as well. While the album ended up filled in with halfway Motown-esque songs, Madonna's proven talent as a collaborator would pave her way to go, along with her own brilliant songs like ""Lucky Star,"" which shines brightly enough to foresee her decades to come."
3,Don't throw the vinyl out.....,"The Burning Up version here (3.45) is not the original vinyl album mix (4.48), and yet it's not listed as a radio edit, either original or new. This short mix (speeded up and edited?) is a ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" kind of tune. I like it, but prefer the slower burn of the original album version.Why doesn't the record company tell you what they've done? Why not include the original as well, with space not an issue? Maybe because, judging by all the reviews here, nobody notices.But the cover should really say, ""Remastered (and a bit different to what you originally bought and liked)""."
3,Being very generous,"I am being VERY generous by giving Madonna's debut album 3 stars. I've always had issues with her albums. The singles were great and classic as were the videos, but the albums were always bad in the 80's up til her ""Like A Prayer"" album. ""Madonna"" even further proves that point. The singles ""Lucky Star"", ""Holiday"" and ""Borderline"" are all incredible and made her into a star. If you want a bunch of filler songs then buy this. Otherwise I'd ignore it if I were you."
3,"Great songs, but...","THESE SONGS ARE TOO LONG!!!! Get the singles instead. ""Holiday"" is SIX MINUTES LONG, for Pete's Dragon!! And plus, the songs that AREN'T singles (that would be the songs on the album that aren't ""Holiday,"" ""Borderline,"" and ""Lucky Star"") are just awful Awful AWFUL! (""Burning Up"" has an electric guitar?? WHY?!?!??) Those singles, man, they're awesome though. Just too long. Three or four great songs, and about four lame-ohs. As a result, it's more consistent than any album Britney Spears ever made."
2,Not her most inspired effort,"While its importance in bringing r&b fused dance music to the mainstream should not go unregarded, there's still no hiding that Madonna's self titled debut contains mostly shallow dance/pop songs with even shallower lyrics. It sounds dated almost to cringe inducing levels.Top Cuts: Holiday, Borderline, Burning Up"
4,great cd,"This cd show the beinging of madonna career like someone said before madonna didn,t start in POP as most people think she started out in R&B music when this record was made she got urbarn played frist. I also know that Donna Summer is her idol people praised her now but and many people compare to Duff and these teenboppers these girls. Are apart of THE mainsteam MADONNA WAS out in and the beinging wasn,t underrated by the mainsteam back in the 80,s if you white person who started. BLACK music you did not get the same treatment AS a white in pop music you were treat like you black countparts this help LP save dance music If SHE from the pop world they would praise form Day one i found this out an 80,s r&b show."
5,Pop perfection,"I used to own this album on vinyl, and it remains one of Madonna's standout albums. This is how we were all introduced to her. I recently picked up the digitally remasterd CD, and listening to it reminded me what a classic it is. From the opening track ""Lucky Star"", it was great to hear these classics again ... and more importantly in their original form. Buying this album is the only way to get ""Holiday"", ""Borderline"" and ""lucky Star"" as we all first heard them. The compilation ""Immaculate Collection"" swapped them for remixes. Also included on this album is ""Burning Up"" which was an early hit for Madonna but ommitted from the Immaculate Collection. Other standout gems on the album include ""Think of Me"" and ""everybody"".Overall, a must own Madonna album."
1,Broken record,Record arrived on time. However it was not scratched but broken hence I have no use for it. I would of understood if there had been a small scratch but not completely broken. This is unacceptable. I'm very disappointed.
2,Great promise...but poor songwriting,"Okay, I first heard the track Sleeping Satellite and fell in love with it. This song was great. It was a song you could kick your feet back to, pop open and beer, and just soak up life. Sleeping Satellite is the first track on the cd, and after that, unfortunately, the rest of the cd fizzles off into pure progressive-pop rock boredom. The songwriting is horrible. The last nine songs on this cd sound like something Wilson Phillips would have released.Keep in mind though, this is only a debut cd, and there is a lot of promise here. Tasmin Archer is very talented. This is evident from listening to Great Expectations. However, her talent needs time to mature. I am anxiously awaiting her second cd, because I believe that she will have realized this album's weaknesses and invested in some better songwriting."
1,one of the bests,"this is actually one of the greatest albums of all time. from lords of the new church to somebody's daughter, you couldn't ask for the best of the most subtle music combined with powerful vocals that tasmin has to offer. i have purchased this album over and over, and have introduced her to many of my friends with nothing but the best things to say about the music. every song has a message to say, and speaks to everyone. not may people have heard her music let alone of her, they are missing out. i myself have been waiting for more from her but will always wait for something else to satisfy my tasmin fix. enjoy."
5,Excellent set of tapes to get you to awareness,"I have listened to the set of tapes several times.I find Dr. Wolinsky easy to understand and find his method of going through the different dimensions (external, mind/thoughts, body, feelings/emotions) to be a uncomplicated way of understanding the different levels and getting to the I; the not I, I; the essence and the void.I recommend it highly for those interested in pursuit of the self, essence."
2,Not very good.,"I don't know how many times I can listen to this guy ask ""If you don't use your thoughts, memories, emotions, associations, or perceptions, how do you experience X"". I don't know what this question is supposed to do for you or why he thinks that asking it over and over for different experiences does anything for anyone."
3,Early and rough,"If you already have Lido and the Too Pure Peel Sessions, this is an interesting detour.Th' Faith Healer's sound hadn't really crystalized when these tracks were recorded, so don't expect the all-enveloping and mesmerizing drone of later records. Instead, the songs here are intense blasts of noise.Completists will have fun comparing the versions of ""Reptile Smile"" and ""Gorgeous Blue (Flower)"" here to the more polished performances on Lido and the ""Don't Jones Me"" EP."
1,Not The Item Pictured!,"The red ferret T is not the item pictured. It is a white ringer T with BORN TO ""DOOK"" printed on it."
2,"Songs are good, bad arrangements","The CD includes 3 of the best songs performed by Riperton Perfect angel, Memory Lane and Lovin' You, but unfortunately, the arrangements are not good, and really worsen the songs with birds sound and violins. These ""modern"" arrangements are not in the line of blues sound."
5,Minnie Riperton...long gone but not forgotten,"Its a shame that her career began to take off only after she'd come out with ""Lovin U"". She truly was one of the most talented female artists of the 70's. And she was probably the first woman to introduce the high notes into R&B and her highest note was B6 (she sang an ascending scale at the end of Can You Feel What I'm Saying).But she could also sing down to her lowest note E3, same song. This is close to a 4 octave range; not 5 as it says on some of the reviews here.In any case Minnie Riperton mostly wrote timeless love ballads that will touch your heart and leave you in awe."
5,The Best of Minnie Riperton,"I was not disppointed with the cd, the songs were all songs that I had treasured in the past. The clarity of the music was magnificent. I am throughly enjoying the best of Minne Riperton's cd.I will highly recommend it to all who loves Minnie's music."
4,The Best of Minnie Riperton,"Any Minnie Riperton fan would enjoy the CD ""The Best of Minnie Riperton"". She left a living legacy and singing testament of her talent to enjoy for years to come."
1,haven't gotten it yet!!!!,I am sure it would be nice had I received it by now....suspect the postal carrier is enjoying it......LOL LOL LOL. As of 01/01/13 I still ave not received it....What happened?
4,A MASTER PIECE!!!,"FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO HEAR A REAL VOICE WITH REAL MELODIES PLAYING, THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU! THIS WOMAN (MINNIE RIPERTON) WAS SO AMAZING ! I FELL IN LOVE THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THE VOICE. THE KEY TRACKS ARE: ""LOVING YOU"", ""CAN YOU FEEL WHAT I'M SAYIN'"", ""INSIDE MY LOVE"" & ""LIGHT MY FIRE"". IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION! TRUE FANS SHOULD CHECK OUT THE HARD TO FIND ""ADVENTURES IN PARADISE"" ALBUM. THIS CD WAS PRODUCED BY: STEVIE WONDER, LEON WARE, MINNIE RIPERTON & RICHARD RUDOLPH. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!"
5,"Forever, Minnie.","First of all let me say that this CD is absolutely wonderful and so full of great memories of Minnie. I was so facinated by her voice that I tried to immitate her many times in talent shows. I was heartbroken when I heard on the radio that she had passed at the tender age of 31. She was a ""Perfect Angel"". Fans, if your looking for something truly wonderful to listen to for years to come, buy this CD and listen to the timeless voice of Miss Riperton."
3,Amazon instant video isn't showing the correct movie,"I rented this movie and instead of the 1995 movie with the sign language gorilla, I get a 2011 documentary narrated by morgan freeman about orphan elephants and orangatangs.. - which wasn't bad but it wasn't what I thought I was going to see."
2,Not great but not awful,"If you somewhat remember the headlines from this story and can recall the basic outline of the situation involving Amy Grossberg, Brian Peterson and the disposal of their newborn son, you will probably like this book. For those who followed the case closely and are looking for very detailed and lengthy interviews with Amy and Brian and other law officials involved in the trial, you will be disappointed. You could save yourself the $6.99 and read a few CNN archive articles and/or the case history on crimelibrary.com and get the same information that is in this book. It does have eight pages of photos, again, nothing that new that has not been recycled throughout the media for the past ten years, and in black and white as well. In sum, for hardcore true crime fans or intense followers of the case only."
3,ALWAYS IN OUR HEARTS,I AM A TRUE CRIME JUNKIE ... I JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE AS I READ THIS BOOK WHAT I WAS READING .. THIS CRIME WAS JUST TOO BIZARRE .. THE STORY WAS WELL TOLD AND KEPT MY INTESEST .. I'D SAY ITS A GOOD READ FOR THE CRIME FAN ..
5,Insightful journey,"""Dancing into Darkness: Butoh, Zen and Japan"" is an excellent resource for Drama and Dance Teachers who are truly trying to understand an art form that they may not be too familiar with. I found particularly useful the author's ability to describe some of the dances she witnessed, the language creates clear and beautiful images in the reader's mind and if read to a class with music in the background or with the students lying down eyes closed it could definitely help their understanding of this unusual style.Maureen Billiau"
3,Fair release,"Not the best release in the world but not the worst either, it is quiet and the strap is ok but I now have better."
2,Not worth the price,good fit but trigger arm was too short. Had to buy extension to make it work and that ended up making the total cost way more expensive than what this release is worth.
3,Good Release,I'm happy with the release. It functions really well. Wish I had purchased the one with the buckle instead. I'll use this one for practice and pick up the buckle one for when I hunt. I hate using velcro when in the stand is all.
3,Good product,I have large wrists so a little more adjustment on the wrist band would be nice. Otherwise good product works well. If you have large wrists or big hands look into the more adjustable releases.
5,killed an 8 point buck with this.,"I just want to tell any one thinking about buying this, they need to stop think and buy it, my first time hunting I used this realase and it was nice and smooth I got an 8 point buck."
3,A somewhat disappointing follow-up to Trainmice,"To be honest, my wife and I disagree on this book. After our 1-year old son took so quickly to ""Here come Train Mice!"", I was psyched to buy another Wong Herbert Yee book. Though Truckmice has the same look and feel, I think the illustrations and accompanying text aren't as obvious as they should be. And there's no simple storyline (as in Train Mice). But my wife thinks the book teaches him about what some of these commonly seen vehicles are and it is easy to read. So, we split the difference and give it 3 stars. Our son agrees - he never gets tired of Train Mice, but Truckmice is hit or miss. So, if you haven't bought either of these two books, definitely go with Train Mice first."
5,Best Jazz piano book,"This is truly one of the best artistry edition from WB , if you like The Artistry of Bill Evans 1& 2, then this is absolutly better stuff. Tuff but for real this also related to one album of Shearing (Piano) from concord Jazz, so you can learn what it should hear,,,worth more I think than Oscar Peterson note for note,,,especially shearing song book."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS BEFORE,This game sort of went down and the strategy guide didn't have much in it. It was pretty bad.
5,You Have To Buy This Book,This book is great because it is out before the game is and you can beat the game when you get it.You can do this because you already know what to do and know how to destroy the evil in RESIDENT EVIL SURVIVOR
2,Not very kid like,"I do not believe this is a child's CD. The voice did not seem very good for keeping a child's attention. There did not seem to be anything that would keep a child listening. The content was fine but not what I expected. I love the Bible and wanted to share this with my granchildren, but I think they will be bored."
5,Yummy Herring,"Without a doubt the best tasting smoked herring I have ever tasted good fish SUPERB sauce.Give them a try, so tasty..."
3,"yeah, no.","yeah lol ok i was expecting more, but watching this is really awkward. fall out boy play five songs to an empty theater and the interview is only andy and pete. lol and when i say empty theater- oh yeah. no crowd what so ever, and you can hear every detail of the music being played, which is both good and bad. i love live in pheonix soooo much better, so i would recommend buying that instead :O"
2,"Well, I bought it....","I admit I expected a bit more...Three campaign models are discussed here in some detail - pirates, pulp fiction and...something else - gothic stuff, I think?The equipment list and monsters are a bit skimpy, tables are reproduced, artwork is nice, but the whole seems to lack a bit. On the good side, it contains descriptions of all sorts of archaic personal firearms (now I can equip my post apocalyptic mutated badgers with gatling guns and pepperbox pistols - but I could have figured that stuff out anyway, I suppose). The Sailing combat rules are solid also.I guess for the price its a good buy, but not quite what I was expecting."
4,"Good supplement, plenty of info","This d20 Modern supplement is exactly what you'd expect. The book is divided into time periods and each one has all the info you'd need to run a campaign or scenario in that time period. Each period also includes a couple of Prestige Classes to go along with that time period. It also does a good job of keeping you informed of what items are appropriate for each time period. For instance, the weapons charts tell you what year each weapon was first used, thus if you are striving for chronological accuracy, you'll have no problem."
3,A bit too light for the price,"Like most of the WotC D20 supplements, this one is well laid out, with good presentation and art. That being said it is even more of a niche book than D20 Future. If you are planning to run a D20 campaign set in the past than it may prove useful. Be forewarned though that its page count seems to be lacking. What is here is pretty good but really its not enough to justify the price. Even the descriptions of the different time settings are far too little."
3,"Not awful, but give him a few years","I'll start off saying that there are exactly five songs on this album that I listen to with any regularity: ""Eu Sou Melhor Que Voc"" (intelligent lyrics, very spare feel to the music), ""Das Partes"" (the Wurlitzer in the background and the general oddball feel make this lovely fun), ""Arrivederci"", ""Rio Longe"" (I rather like a bit of cheese factor in my entertaiment, and these two songs have it out the wazoo), and ""Assim"" (kind of bouncy, jazzy feel to this one). The rest ranges from utter Valium (""Serto"", ""Esfinge"") to just kind of uncomfortable-sounding (""Enquanto Isso""). Moreno is definitely not his father, though there are places where it's obvious that he's trying. In My Arrogant Opinion, he needs a while more (and a few more albums' worth of compositions under his belt) to really hone his skills and develop his own musical personality more."
5,Love it,"I am a repeat buyer and will continue to be as long as the price stays the same. Excellent product at a excellent rice"""
4,Herbalife Tea instead of Coffee for me!,I really didn't like the taste the first time I tried the Herbalife tea! I added some splenda and popped it in the microwave and now I had a great cup of tea. It does give me an energy boost however not much of one which is perfect for me!There are a couple different flavors that I like; The Raspberry is a favorite.
5,Always Been a Favorite!,"I have been drinking the original flavor for about 15 years on-and-off. I had tried it when I was using Herbalife products for weight-loss and still drink it today. To me, it tastes better than traditional tea from a tea bag, and gives me great energy and seems to help with metabolism. It is great iced or hot."
5,Love this tea,Herbal concentrate tea tastes so good. I always drink it. This item came in a good condition. Highly recommand to others :)I think it really helps you especially when you want to lose weight.
3,Herbalife Tea,"I love the great, refreshing taste of this tea, especially with crushed ice. It's a real thirst quencher in the summer."
2,Wrong Flavor,I ordered Raspberry flavor. I received original. Not sure if I will order again. I did not request a refund.
1,FAKE PRODUCT!!!!,"This is not a real product from Herbalife, that's why its cheap. It's fake and won't buy it again. I recommend to purchase Herbalife products only from reliable distributors not online. Most products that are sold online already expired. Will report this to Herbalife!!!"
3,delusional,"i've read this guys other book on the great american tax dodge and there are so many errors and just flat out bizarre assertions that I couldn't even imagine giving any credibility to him. I am in the top 1% of wage earners and my annual tax bill is easily greater than 43%, state and federal. I get virtually no deductions or credits. While there are certainly issues with corporate welfare and people who don't have income (the mega-rich,like the Kennedy's, Kerry/Heinz', Soros) who live off dividends and interest, the suggestion that somehow the top 1% don't pay tax is just bizarre. Is the middle class going to get screwed if things continue? Yes, as they are asked to pick up the burden of paying for pork, earmarks, illegals, legals, indigent, EBT cards, public sector salaries and pensions, etc. But don't blame the 1%! We make what we earn. Blame the 49% who are the recipient class."
3,America: Who Really Pays the Taxes,I have found this book rather boring. Taxes aren't nearly as thrilling as a Tom Clancy novel. But I have learned quite a bit from this reading. The authors have (thankfully) made it readable by adding scenerios that have happened to real people. They have obviously spent a lot of time in their research. It is a well written and well researched book
3,Not worth the money,I bought this and it's great looking and fun but the feathers start falling off as soon as you take it out of the box
2,No worky-worky,"I bought two of these cables for new LED monitors I recently purchased. Both monitors and my video card (EVGA 9800GT) has the proper connections to support the dvi-i dual link. However, when I connected them, the monitors automatically switched to Analog and will not display on digital. Every attempt I've made to update the drivers to the graphics card and monitors have not resolved this issue. I am more than slightly disappointed. Not sure what the problem is, but I am blaming this on the cables. Going to purchase two dvi-d dual links from Tripp Lite here on Amazon. Hopefully those work as advertised."
4,love jean reno,"always a favorite-jean reno wins isn't requiring twenty more words is foolish it's a quick review not a critique, really?"
3,Long and action packed,"It's not a bad movie and it's quite long....about two hours. By the end I was a little tired. It's not Reno's finest performance and I prefer his role as commissioner Niémans in 'Crimson Rivers' and 'Angels of Apocalypse'. Nevertheless, a good way to spend a couple of hours."
4,Good French action thriller,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a pretty decentFrench action flick. Good story with nice twists and turns along the way. Theactors are all very good with the lead actress looking very much like CarrieMoss. Some of the images early in the film made me think this might be a sci-fihorror flick but it turned into a nice crime drama. This was well worth theVOD rental price.
2,A few cards short,"The central female character, Anna (Arly Jover), is engaging whilst she struggles to uncover her mysterious origins but the two protagonists striving to solve the same mystery by tracking down the murderers of her predecessors are quite unlikeable. Moreover there never is a plausible connection between all the dead Turkish women and Anna except for their nationality. Its never explained why the Wolves killed them or how their deaths came about.Far too much of this movie makes little or no sense until the end and then the explanations just leave you cold. Who are the Wolves? Turkish Terrorists? Why are they Terrorists? Oh, no reason, they're just evil. Only evil guys would hide out in the famous Christian catacombs in Turkey - unnoticed by thousands of tourists and locals.Give this film a miss and pick up Wasabi instead!"
3,Jean Reno,Tough cop Reno solves case about mad Turkish extremists trying to take over the world - it's a crazy violent romp. The French make it more complicated than it needs to be with numerous sub-plots and red herrings.Great sound!
3,Empire of the Cockerels not really wolves!,"This is a kind of movie that you cannot understand what it's all about until the last 15-20 minutes. From the name of the movie you can think it's about the Turkish mafia or French made the Turks again the bad guys in Europe. But in the reality, it's about the drug traffic to Europe from Kurdish terrorists growing heroin close to Iraq border and shipping to Europe using Turkey. Ironicly French government agency is being involved secretly in this relation with this Kurdish terrorist group as well as Turkish agents(grey wolves) against it."
2,Two stars instead of one because the first half was good,"I really enjoyed this film until the second half started to go downhill. A lot of things just did not make sense toward the end. This is the kind of movie that needs to be remade in the U.S. - all they have to do is fix the second half of the film, mostly the last 15 minutes. If you are a big Jean Reno fan, this is for you, but I thought the female lead was dynamite until the plot got loose toward the end."
4,still going strong,"This is yet another great album from Hall. He follows up his debut album, ""The Truth"" wonderfully. Also has remnants of Guy on the album. A must get for any Hall or Guy fan."
2,KINDA BORING,"I have the most respect for Aaron Hall.. i think he is an exceptional vocalist.. but the material here is lacking any depth, feeling, it is just there nothing more outside of All The Places and You Make Me Feel Good Inside.. there isnt really much more to offer on this album"
4,Aaron Hall Came On The Scene FIRST.,"i have all of guy's releases and now i have this one.so far i really enjoy what i'm hearing.aaron's vocals are top-notch.even on his first release.see, r.kelly didn't come on the scene until the early 90's.Aaron hall with guy came out in the late 80's so you know where kelly got his ""steez"" from."
3,AFTER 2 OR 3 ROTATIONS IT HITS,"When I first gave this CD some rotation I wasn't feeling it too much. Personally, I long too much for Aaron's vocals and Teddy's Music (a perfect marriage). But as the NastyMan proved on ""The Truth"" he can blow up a ballad with the best of them. When I started listening to the first 4 tracks and to number 10 I come to realization that Aaron should become the balladeer (for a whole album)that his vocal maturity suggests. Don't worry about those uptempo grooves. Just hit us with the slow jams so your gift (the voice) can truly shine.."
3,Just a little bit extra . . .,"And I am not talking about Aaron either. I am talking to whoever wrote the review that needs deciphering. You might think that you sound ""fly"" and all, but that is so unnecessary. And I know you one of my ""people"" (yall know what I mean). And we often wonder why is it so hard for us to be taken seriously . . . well take a look at trying-to-be-ghetto(for whatever reason)words like ""knowmsayun"". This might be funny to some. I have to admit, I laughed when I first read it, but it is also sad that we feel like we have to express ourselves like this to get attention.p.s. I love Aaron Hall's music"
2,Aaaron Hall,"YO WORD IS BOND, YAAMEEN, FOR REAL SON, WORD AARON IS FLY KNOWMSAYUN? YO WHAT THE DEELY YO,check this out right here ya meen? for rilla i'ma bout gettin tha scrilla yaa meen? ma G IS TOO FUTURISTIC KID.....ON THE STRENGTH.......tHE ALBUM IS GOOD AND I LIKED IT."
5,Squeaky Mice,"These are the small (about the size of a real mouse) velvety mice that squeak. My pit bull absolutely adores them! He gets through them pretty quickly, but they are his very favorite and he'll play with them for hours, even after he kills the squeaker and rips chunks out of the hide. It's not like any of his toys last any longer than that, so it's a perfect, affordable, instant hit every time!"
5,"Honest, peaceful, calming music from a Great Artist","I met the artist, and had a chance to listen his live music. My kids listen to this music prior to going to sleep. Highly recommended. Honest, peaceful, calming music from a great artist. Check his 2 other CDs including Guitarrisima. I wish I could find more such CDs."
3,Solid reference grammar,"This is a clear and concise reference grammar, best used by linguists (or linguists at heart) who wish to access the phonetics, morphology, and syntax of Hawaiian at a glance. It is NOT a teach-yourself guide to Hawaiian. In fact, most of the example words used throughout the grammar are left untranslated.Again, a good overview of the Hawaiian language but not a good intro for people whose goal is to actually speak and read Hawaiian."
5,Works well!,"I've been using this product almost daily for about two months. It really does help me with my mood and sense of well being. I don't worry and stress as much when I take it. I do notice a difference if I don't take it. I take one per day in the morning, usually. If I need a little more than melatonin in the evening, I'll take it before bed along with my melatonin. It helps me sleep, too. I think it's a great product."
2,Not recommended for use on vehicles,"I was attracted to the product because of its price and the fact that it can easily be removed. The film delivers on both counts but also has two major limitations:1. The film is not fully transparent, i.e. it will blur/distort vision through the window.2. The film is very sensitive to scratching. I used a professional squeegee for installation of the film with plenty of water but still ended up with lots of scratches on it.As a result, I do not consider the film suitable for use on vehicles unless the only purpose of the film is to block vision both ways - in which case you should go for the darker (5% VLT) version of film (this one has 20% VLT).I pulled mine off again and sent it back."
1,Doesn't stick!,"This product comes out of the package nice, but will not stick on the window for more than a few minutes. If it looks too good to be true...IT IS!"
1,DO not buy for plastic convertibles,This is not good if you are going to use it in a plastic convertible. It simply does not work! Save your money for something else.
3,History,This book is mostly about the History of the art. It doesn't teach you too much about HOW to break. I don't personally have this book but my friend has an old copy of it. Nice Pictures.
5,Toughest Cowboy boot ever,These are the best boots I've found for those that are hard on boots. The only thing that even compares is the Harley biker boots which are tough but don't look near so good. I've been wearing these boots for 2 years and will be wearing them for a long time to come. I do wish they put in a thicker pad insert because that wore out a long time ago. If you want a tough cowboy boot then get these.
1,wHY IS THIS 3 TIMES THE PRICE ON kINDLE???,"This is not a review of the book, I'm concerned that the Kindle edition is three times the price of the paperback which is $80.Why the difference? I have noticed similar price gouging in the history section for a lot of books I'd otherwise buy on Kindle.Seems there's a pattern going on here. The mass market novels are cheap (as well they should be) but anything of substance is being priced into the stratosphere. Anyone else see this happening?"
4,She'll Make Better Albums,"Sara Evans is an incredible talent, but this album doesn't consistently show it. In fact, this is like three albums in one. The first three songs is where Sara rises above the standard Nashville formula. But even her wonderful voice can rise above the mediocrity of the songs on this middle section of this album. But then, the final three songs are worth the whole price of admission. This is where Sara lets loose her true country instincts. Alison Krauss and George Jones lend perfect harmonies and we finally see what Sara is truly capable of."
3,Quick Review,"Another enjoyable album from Sara Evans. Highlights: Cryin' game, Fool I'm a woman, I thought I'd see your face again. Lowlights: These days, Love don't be a stranger, and There's only one."
4,Delightful country,Sara Evans is one of my favorite country singers. I find myself often playing this CD and singing along. Many of Sara's songs are upbeat and fun.
4,Strong Sophmore,"Born to Fly is less traditional than Sara's debut ""Three Cords and Truth"" but certainly still a country album. Her voice remains awesome. Here are good songs:Great Unknown - uptempo tune about getting away with lover and throwing selves on fateCrying Game - great tune, best on hereFool I'm a WomanLove Don't Be a Stranger - done by other singers, Sara's is best.Cupid"
5,Excellent!,"No Place That Far is a wonderful album, and my favorite song is the title track (a very beautiful song; Sara Evans and Vince Gill sound great!) I also like The Great Unknown, Cryin' Game, Fool, I'm A Woman, and Cupid. This is good, wholesome country, and Sara has a gorgeous voice. I'd recommend picking this cd up!"
5,SUPERB,"Sara Evans and No Place That Far is an exceptional CD. Its one of my favorites to date. She does a great job both singing and writing the songs. My favorites on this CD are Fool, I'm a Woman with Martina McBride, These Days with Allison Krause, and I Thought I'd See Your Face Again. Sara's harmony vocals are outstanding! She has those songs that just make you want to crank the volume up and sing along!"
4,No sophmore slump,"Sara Evans' second album NO PLACE THAT FAR finds the singer pushing her vocals a little more, and making her sound a little more contemporary. Of course the breakthrough hit was the title track, a duet with Vince Gill, which helped put her on the map and in the hearts of country radio listeners. It's a great ballad and definately a signature song for her. The album opens with the honky tonk ""The Great Unknown"", which is a fun fiesty little song that would have been a good single. ""Cryin Game"" was also a single from the album, it's a charming uptempo number. The other single was ""Fool I'm A Woman"" which is a great song. None of the singles did as well as the title track, which was the only real hit of the album. There's some great songs here, such as ""I Thought I'd See Your Face Again"", ""The Knot Comes Untied"" and ""There's Only One"". A good album start to finish!"
3,Just another CD in my collection...,"For me this was just another one of those CDs that I listen to a few times when I first get it, then play only the singles until finally it sits in my CD tower to be for the most part forgotten! Nothing on this album was really ""I love it"" material for me. Nothing that called me back to listen to it over and over again. I think Restless is her best album so far (although I have not yet bought the newest release)."
4,perception,"This, like all of Coney's books is different. It's not your everyday book. A very good read when you want something different."
2,save your money!,"I bought this budget cd with 5 songs from Blue Oyster Cult and 5 from Nazareth. The quality of the portion of the cd with Blue Oyster Cult isn't bad, but the part with Nazareth sounds like crap. Also all of the songs by Nazareth fade out before the songs are even finished. Save your money! If you're looking for a live album from either group, go for a full length one, that isn't from the budget section."
2,Spurious scholarship,"For starters, one is suspicious of the level of scholarship when pertinent and absolutely obvious facts are incorrect. Hibbing MN lies on the Mesabi Iron Range; the Hull Rust Mahoning Mine is the largest open pit mine in the world--and it is an iron mine. The Mesabi Iron Range produced about 90 per cent of the steel used in the development of the US, including the Golden Gate bridge. Hundreds, if not thousands of Slovene immigrants--including my grandparents-- contributed to this effort with great pride and for the author to speak about strip mining and copper mining is simply bewildering. How can she ever have been to Hibbing and not known this?Second, there are many stories to be told which would illustrate her premises--there are precious few included in this book. Lots of quotes from other academicians, not too much meat to this story."
2,Oooooold,"I messed with plugs and drivers for several days before giving up on it, (trying to use with a PC, wouldn't ya know it, both Microsoft, shouldn't this be smoother?) however I will attempt to review. The gun was very light compared to other gaming guns, even regular controllers. Buttons were also nice to press, no sticking or toughness, and I could reach each of them with my puny girl hands."
5,Malaclyptic masterpiece,This book is an amazing look at the life of this prankster brought low by the weight of his own paranoid but not entirely unbelievable fantasies. I met Thornley in his final days in Atlanta and found him to be warm & congenial but was unaware that he was living in the storage room of the used bookstore in Little Five Points or I would have attempted to offer him what meager assistance I could have. Despite his own problems he still managed to reach out and help others in need in the community and he is sorely missed.
4,heavy metal,this item came in a timely manner and was a nice edition to my other wasp cd's i already had.
5,great dog shampoo,This is a great pet shampooMy long haired Collie is tough to rinse and then brush out and she has sensitve skin that gets irritated after most shampoosThis cedar shampoo cleans great and rinses easily and only leaves a slight cedar scent not a heavy perfumeIt also makes brushing her out easier because it does not wash out all the natural oils in her hairit is very gentle and she no longer gets that itchy red rash on her belly from the othersI also get about five washes per bottle wich is good considering her very lond and thick furthanks for the great product
3,Where to start?,"I accidentally, somehow, started this movie about an hour in. The funny thing is that it actually would've been better. I went back and watched the beginning and it was what you already KNOW the movie is about. They really amp up the violence to make it ""affect"" you more, but it's a little too much and just makes you uncomfortable. Jodie Foster did a good job with the part. An interesting glimpse into the human condition, as well as the failure of law enforcement and the legal system in most criminal situations. Just okay..."
3,"NEIL JORDAN, OPUS 15",*** 2007. Directed by Irish born director Neil Jordan. Jodie Foster earned a nomination for the Golden Globes for her performance in this movie. A NYC woman becomes a vigilante after the brutal death of her boy-friend. Not bad but it's nonetheless a little disappointing film from the author of such masterpieces asThe End of the AffairorMona Lisa - Criterion Collection.
3,Misses the mark,"It had the potential to be much better, but doesn't quite reach there. The movie tries hard to hint at something deep and philosophical about the change in personality that the main character (Jodie Foster) undergoes, while in reality, it doesn't quite build up and much of it seems forced. What is even more stupid and annoying is that she takes it on herself to clean up the society after her personal tragedy. The audience is expected to have sympathy towards her and the lead male character (Howard Terrence) - that's the way both characters are developed - as both of them are shown trying to deal with their own tragedy/break-up. Towards the end they actually get closer to each other. Ms. Vengeance gets her revenge too. OK, so did I miss anything that you couldn't predict by now? Well, honestly, it's not a terrible movie. I had expected it to be more interesting seeing so many good reviews, and it ends up being just a shade better than the ordinary."
3,Very Predictable,"Not a very original story line, very predictable. Not a bad rental for $3.99 on Unbox, but it's not a must see movie."
4,good drama/revenge movie,"i just watched this the other night and it was pretty good. its kind of like death sentence except the main character is a girl. this movie is a little bit worse than that one which a rated a 5. the ending on this movie was better than the death sentence movie but this movie was overall slower. solid movie nonetheless, and worth a rental"
4,Could have been better,"Great scenes with Foster and Howard lift this from the average. A ridiculous finale drags it down. What's with the modern movie endings? Too much audience participation? Cowardly studios? ""No Country..."" had guts."
3,so-so,"Almost the female version of Robert Deniro in ""Taxi Driver"". Liked the movie but glad we did not pay the high ticket price to see it in the movie theatre!"
2,"Jodie, you're better than this!","Weak re-telling of 'Death Wish' with Jodie Foster as the wronged victim who fights (shoots) back. I'm surprised she was involved in this movie, both for the topic and the overall weakness of it. Watched the first hour, then ended up fast-forwarding through the last 45 minutes just to see how it ended."
5,"Now, who's the b****?","New York radio host Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) and boyfriend David Kirmani ( Naveen Andrews ) were taking a walk in the park and were brutally assaulted by punks. Jodie survived the ordeal and changed into a different person. She decided to protect herself from any more harm by buying a firearms. Things start to happen, and she prove to herself that she can protect herself in time of dangerous situations. NYPD Detective Mercer (Terence Howard) is the officer in charge of the assault case, eventually get involved with the investigations of the crimes committed by Jodie.The ending was excellent and was totally unexpected.Contain violence and brief sexual content.Featured semi-auto pistol : Kahr K9 9mm pistol."
3,Just OK,"I liked this movie better in the 70's when it was called ""Death Wish"" with Charles Bronson. Pretty much the same plot, mild mannered person has loved one killed by dirt bags in a random act of violence and goes on vigilante killing spree. Nothing too memorable about this, I guess I just expected more out a Jodie Foster movie."
5,A great flick with a great actress!,"How could one not love a film containing the talent of Jody Foster? The story line was crisp and moved well; Foster was totally believable as the lead character; She dispatched the bad guys without displaying a lot of gore or brutality, even tyhough they each deserved it. :o)I can't fault the movie in the least. The quality of the production was s good as any, plus the audio was flawless. It is a movie you will watch again and again!"
5,The Brave One Movie,This movie was brand new when I got it and it is in excellent shape and it is an awesome movie. Jodie Foster is a great actress and once again she gives a powerful performance. I would definitely recommend this movie and buy it on Amazon.
3,it had me until the ending,if you like jodie foster and vigilante flicks you'll like this movie. terence howard is always thrilling to watch and he delivers in the brave one. i won't spoil it by giving away any details but the ending just didn't match the uncertainty and intensity of the rest of the film.
5,Awesome,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. My father enjoyed it too. It ranks up there with the Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" sereies. Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard were fantastic in the movie."
2,Ugh,"I have been let down by my fellow Amazon reviewers on this one. So many 5-star reviews for this cliche filled mess. I shan't waste much time on this one, I'll give a very brief plot synopsis. Jody Foster is a simple, quiet woman who becomes a killing machine after a violent event in her life (ala Mr. Bronson- Death Wish 1 through 18). She starts out barely able to hold a handgun, yet by the second day she is firing sniper quality rounds and performing hand to hand combat punches worthy of a Navy Seal. They threw in a troubled and emotionally torn detective as an attempt to add dialogue, however it falls flat and adds nothing to the film. You've seen it all before folks, not even worth a rental. Spoiler.......I gave it 2 stars because she gets the dog back at the end so at least there wasn't needless animal violence tossed in. Thumbs down"
2,Meh.,"A lot of problems with this one. Quite a few long boring scenes that stretched my patience. Many scenes were just implausible (NY subway stations are NEVER empty). Many scenes seemed stagey, not realistic. They seemed like set pieces. Had to take a break several times to break up the monotony. Jodie is a fine actress but I never really cared deeply about her character. The best part of the movie was the cute dog!! Dogs rock!!"
2,So many remakes. So much wasted time.,"Hollywood is out of ideas. This movie was ok, JUST OK, and I'm still kicking myself for spending $5 at the video store on a film I've seen a dozen times. Save the money. You can get this movie for the cost of a VHS tape or blank DVD. Check your tv listing for Charles Bronson's <u>Death Wish</u>. Except for the gender of the main character and a few other details, this movie is nothing but a remake of that one. Writer's. Go back on strike and use your free time to find some inspiration. Stop stamping your names on Asian films and old films you hope nobody remembers."
1,laughable,"oh my god, I love Jodie Foster and yet felt like she was asleep throughout this movie. A frustrating waste of time."
2,Forgettable,"I've always had a bad feeling about The Brave One, ever since I saw the ""subway thug"" licking his knife blade in the film's trailer before it hit theaters. And sure enough, I was pretty much right. The characters - especially the bad guys - are such silly stereotypes that they nearly ruin what's supposed to be a serious film. It could have been a much better film, if it were made to be realistic; instead it's a generic Hollywood movie in every way. The writing and acting are underwhelming, except for the two leads who give decent performances. It's not necessarily a terrible movie, but it definitely falls a bit flat and isn't as thought-provoking as it aims to be."
2,I skipped the second act,"I think Tom Keough provides a good summary of this film's strengths and weaknesses. I would add three observations: I thought the villains were terrific; I perceived little chemistry between the lovers before they were assaulted, despite the actors' effort to achieve it; and I fast-forwarded all the scenes with Detective Mercer except the ending because I found the revenge theme more compelling. In sum, I am glad I watched this film on DVD instead of at the cinema. Had I seen it at the cinema, I likely would have walked out in the middle of the second act."
2,Mish-Mash,"I must not have seen the same movie as most of the other reviewers.I thought this movie was all over the place........... anti-gun? Pro-Vigilante? Anti-Vigilante? Cop movie? romance??! Pro-Victims rights?!? What already. I got to the end of it and thought ""well that was pretty much a waste of everyones time and money"". Can't even say it was a pro-dog owning movie because the dog has to find HER at the end of the movie!What a mess."
5,Very Powerful Film,"I am not a big Jodie Foster fan but I have to say this movie I really liked, her role & the movie. It has the 3 things I look for in a movie; keep my attention from beginning to end, take something away from the movie or can personally relate to it and a good, appropriate ending. I don't want to spoil it for people who have not seen it, but the ending was great. Sometimes an ending in my opinion can make or break a film. Try this movie out, think you will like it.Peter J. Miller"
2,Depressing Movie,"I chose this movie as one of the free choices to arrive with my new blu ray player and I was disappointed... Not only did the movie include nudity (which I didn't expect and didn't want in my home), but overall its a sad and depressing story of murder and vengeance."
3,Everything Old is New Again...,"Poor Charles Bronson...Does no one remember ""Death Wish""?Three stars for this one for now, perhaps I will see it again.It's not like it's a chore to watch Jodie Foster, who is apparently incapable of being bad, even when her scripts don't deserve her.We'll see..."
3,"The wrong title, the wrong ending","""The Brave One"" is a sensationalist title fitting to such genre but wrong for this film. ""I Walk the City"" would have been more eye catching, appropriate to the film content, and easier on word of mouth promotion.This film is well acted, the cinematography is good, it moves crisply with good dialog. But the plot has the wrong ending. Up to two thirds of the film allows two endings of which the film makers were aware - does the vigilante get caught or not? The chose the wrong outcome. Had the main character been caught, then the sense of audience outrage would have been stirred in the moral dilemma and make it an unforgettable film. Instead the plot gets lost in the meandering relationship between cop and victim.Further they would have had an equally unforgettable sequel. The court scene and her incarceration to be released early on public outcry.Never mind. Foster was again unforgettable and she looks as through she hasn't aged in 25 years."
2,Slow and painful,"This movie doesn't even compare to Death Wish, so please stop with the comparison. Yeah, it's a revenge movie, but that's where it ends.Watching Jodie Foster as the victim was painful and uninspiring. I felt like I could care less about what happened to her.The whole movie felt like it was slowed down to a snail pace to make you try and feel her pain, but it just made it drag on even longer. I just wanted it to end.Speaking of...the ending is also horrible and predictable. I guess this is worthy of a rental if you are really bored, but I would suggest renting Death Wish instead."
5,Jodie Foster is fabulous!,"Jode Foster's acting is this movie deserves an award. Unfortunately, many people are victims of the sort of tragedy her character experiences. How many of us deny this kind of horror exists? She portrays her character's pain and horrible slide into grief and tragedy brillantly. The movie is worth watching just for her performance alone."
2,The Bored One....,"Thats what I was when I saw this. Zzzzzzzz is all I can say. I saw this with my friends earlier this evening and we could barely sit through this mess. Terrence Howard's acting was mediocre and Jodie Foster's performance was as if she was in some kind of coma. Naveen Andrew's (Lost) role was just irrelevant and I could not see the point. And to top it all off, Jodie Foster's hair stylist should be locked up for giving her that horrendous haircut. She looked like Alex P. Keaton from Family Ties with those atrocious choppy locks. Can anyone say Fantastic Sam's? Tired acting, predictable plot, and horrid lighting make this film into a snoozer. Skip this one and save your $8.00 bucks for a lovely T-shirt."
1,R*U Strong Enough?,"I love Jodie Foster, but I did not enjoy this movie. I had a problem with the storyline and some of the acting was a bit amatuer. Jodie Foster did a great job playing her character, doesn't she always? But some of the other actors seemed like they were nervous, or just need more acting lessons. It's hard to get into a movie when the actors don't seem like they know what they're doing. There were too many improbablities in the plot, too many to name. The dialogue was amatuer as well. Like the whole ""radiohead"" thing they kept repeating, please give me a break. And the voice over narration by Jodie Foster sounded like bad poetry, that kind of poetry went out in the 80's. It's like the script was written by a high school drop out. I hope Jodie Foster picks better movies, someone give this girl a good script."
1,NOT LIKELY,"It is laughable to see tiny, little woman like Miss Foster playing the ""macho"" part in movies. As convincing as Demi Moore in JI Jane! Anyone who went through boot camp knows Mrs. Moore would not have survived the first half hour! (I didn't because I'm a woman but my husband did.) Women don't have the strength of men--and I mean PHISICAL strength--no matter what they do. If you think I'm wrong, if you're caught inside a burning building, who'd you trust more to rescue you: a strong man or a strong woman?! Keep in mind that firemen physical fitness requirements (as well as the Military) had to be dropped considerably in order to be able to accommodate women."
1,The Brave One,"It's a Brave person who can sit through this clap trap movie,It is so bloody predictable on what happens,even before it happens.I am surprised that foster would take this role.I will think twice before renting another jodie foster movie.I know jodie can do better than this, give us another(Contact) movie, or silence of the lamb."
3,Bronson Had No Internal Conflicts,"I have to say this was a good film. The pain and suffering that comes across the screen is at times tangible. Very well done.I also enjoyed seeing the very present day circumstances of a woman in NYC, fearing for her life and walking into a gun shop with the intention of arming herself. Only to be denied but getting her hand on a gun 10 minutes later off the street (the myth of gun control).What follows is the conflicted evolution and internal struggle that make up this vigilante killer. In comparison to the famed DEATH WISH series, Bronson had no problem with blowing away scum and cleaning up the streets of roaches. Sleeping like a baby afterwards.Do not expect DEATH WISH in THE BRAVE ONE. The ending was a welcome surprise though."
3,Hardware works; software doesn't,"The Maxtor OneTouch II 300 GB External Hard Drive was ordered with the expectation that the OneTouch would work on a WIN98 platform. While the hardware works fine as an external drive, the Retrospect software has not worked. Worst yet the software hangs the system. The OneTouch software requires the Retrospect software. Support from the Retrospect software company has changed as the company has been purchased.Maxtor Hard Drive works now that the software has been de-installed."
2,Died at 6 mo,"I never kept my drive on unless I was using it, but it died at six months. I also had a Maxtor 5000 and it died at six months. Think I will try something else next time."
4,It needs a cooling fan badly!!!,"Everyone reads about premature failure of Maxtor external hard drive. Mine stopped working once too after 4 straight hours of writing. So what's up? It gets too hot!!! There is a 30x10mm fan space inside the aluminium case, but the fan is not there, and there is only one explanation. Anyway, the good news is, you can remove the 2 screws at the back of the case, pull the unit out, then install a fan yourself and it will run for hours without getting super hot and kill itself. For more details and how the inside looks, just check out my link below. But beware that doing this will void the 1 year warranty. So doing it at your own risk.http://www.pbase.com/wlachan/onetouchii"
3,Maxtor External Drive,Easy to use. Easy to install. Have had three episodes of the external storage drive becoming corrupted and dumping saved files.
2,"Works well, but unreliable","The drive is nicely packaged, easy to install, and works nicely with the included backup software. However, my first OneTouch and its replacement have both failed in the first six months. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but this level of reliability is unacceptable in a backup product. To add insult to injury, I have to pay to ship the dead units back to Maxtor."
2,Bad buy,"I've had a One Touch 250GB for a long time now - no problems at all. Just bought the 300GB expecting the same - couldn't have been more wrong. Inconsistent recognition by Windows XP and 2000 - often needs multiple reboots of both drive and/or machine. Disappointing access times, loud and hot. Not a good experience - wish I had another 250GB One Touch I."
1,beware the enclosure,"Well the drive works well enough, but now that it's out of warranty, the enclosure is not working properly. The power supply connector is being flaky. Operating intermittently if you get it turned in the right direction. It has set on my desk so it hasn't been abused.Looking to see if I could get service, I discovered that the enclosure can't be opened without voiding your warranty. So to get service, you'd have to return the whole thing. There goes all my data stored on it, never to return. No thanks. these external drive makers need to reconsider their warranty policies. If I can remove a working drive with my data on it, why should that void my warranty? Especially if I just need service on the enclosure not the drive.I wouldn't buy this product again, but i doubt there is much better either."
3,Gets far too hot...,Gets so hot after the nights backup - you can hardly touch it - and then it died....I like the drive but....
3,Not as pictured on site,"I ordered this particular item from this seller because it was the best price. However, it was not as pictured at the time I ordered it. It showed that it had the newer style container, with the inner cover that slides over the holes to prevent the product from spilling during travel. Unfortunately, it was the older style of container without the inner cover. Because it takes me over a year to go through this product, I'll be waiting a long time until I can order another one with the no-spill lid!"
2,Way too glittery,"I purchased this in clear radiance and it has virtually no color at all. I also felt like it makes my pores really visible. It does, however, give a soft finish effect similar to the mineral veil. But I absolutely HATE the glitter! I think glitter should be limited to the ""pretend"" makeup that girls under age 6 play with. I think this was a waste of money which is really disappointing since I love all my other Bare Escentuals makeup. I'm going to give it 2 stars assuming the other colors are more visible and maybe less glittery."
1,PRODUCT NEVER RECEIVED!!!!,"I would love to review this product, but I never did receive it. Very disappointed and hope that I have not been charged for it."
2,Too dark,"I thought, from reading the other reviews, that this color would be OK for me but it is still way too dark. I will probably need to dilute it with something else. I have medium fair skin."
2,It's very pink and very shiny,"This product did not provide the ""clear radiance"" I was looking for. My skin is medium to light with yellow undertones. This almost looks like pink eyeshadow. I'm not sure at all how the ""clear"" description applies.I have to use it very sparingly and mixed with other powders, otherwise, I look like a disco queen."
2,microcuts on face from use of bareMinerals,"I have used bareMinerals for years, and like many of the products. The overall face color has not been very natural looking on my skin tone. And today, using one of the bisques, I ended up with microcuts on the right side of my face and nose. Am wondering what is going on."
2,NO CAP?!,"I wasn't so sure about the quality of the product when I received it with a missing top, which is necessary to use Bare Minerals product. I don't know if it was intended with no cap or it was a human error."
3,Not very pretty,Its dark and muddy and sure doesn't look like sun on fair skin. I gave some stars because it may be ok for skin that is not fair.
5,I love BE!,"This clear radiance was delivered promptly and worked great, not too shiny but gives your face a natural glow.My apologies for the previous feedback which was actually in regard of another Bare Mineral product that I have purchased from ANOTHER seller, I accidently posted the comment on the wrong seller site.once again, my apologies for the previous bad review which might have confused everyone."
1,Bare essentuals radiance,"I liked the product, it made the contours of my face more pronounced. It gave my face a healthy glow"
2,This is not bare essentials,"The bare essentials name is misspelled. The id, ego, and super ego are names from another brand, and unlike bare essentials makeup this is not a mineral powder its makeup that cakes. It made my face break out. Buyers BEWARE"
5,Bare Escentuals Warmth,I love Bare Escentuals makeup. The warmth is just the right added touch. It's so quick and easy to use.
1,Dismal!,"I have recently started reading more romances and have been generally pleasantly surprised by the quality of most regency romances. However Caroline Courtney's novel is dire, lacking any characterization, her heroine is but a puppet and her hero appaling and cliched. A thoroughly disappointing read."
5,Brilliant !!!,"If you have a friend who's a PS2 fanboy, and does nothing but COMPLAIN about Xbox's adult sixe controllers (it's not Microsoft's fault that he has little hands)... you just get one of these puppies. Get 2 infact, and then you can switch your PS2 controllers for extra Xbox controllersgreat product"
2,Barely reflective,"This tape is about as reflective as masking tape. I wanted to markup my wife's bike for night riding. I'm returning this to get something that will actually do the job. If you're in the reflective tape business, there is a market opportunity here: large rolls of high quality reflective tape. No one seems to make this. It's either small rolls/strips of the good stuff, or bigger rolls of mediocrity."
1,NOT GLOW IN THE DARK TAPE,"When I typed in glow in the dark tape, this tape appears as a product that ""glows in the dark."" When I saw reflective tape as the product description, I just assumed that it glowed in the dark. I am sure that this is great tape for reflective purposes, but I am very disappointed that it does not glow."
5,very usefull,"I have placed this on my Tadpole trike at every location and angle to make me more visible. The white is very reflective and well worth the money, I used it on the wheel rims, no problem making it bend on my rear 26"" wheel but even after cutting to 1/4"" could not make it follow the rim edge, maybe when the weather gets warmer I will try again, Jimmy"
2,Not that great,"This is not as reflective as the stuff I can get from Walmart. What really upset me was that it's not 1 inch wide, it's 0.93 inches wide. I needed it 1 inch wide. That is why I went through the trouble looking for this product. I am very unhappy. Not as described."
1,"Does not stick to anything, don't waste your money","I tried to use this on my car, I prepped the area with some rubbing alcohol and dried it off, it was a little cold, would not stick at all, it was falling off. I took it inside and left it for a bit and decided to mess with it again inside, it was stickier and loses most of its adhesion in the cold. Inside I was able to get it to stick to a metal cooking pot, but it pulled off easier than painters tape. If you want an idea of how sticky this stuff is grab a piece of wrapping or packing tape, stick it to the palm of your hand about 5-7 times and then stick it something and try and pull it back off. another example is a sticky roller that you just used and needs the sheet ripped off, still a little tacky but not sticky. This stuff is very reflective, but does me no good as it does not stick to anything."
1,JVCC REF-7 Engineering Grade Reflective Tape: 1 in. x 30 ft. (Orange),Must have been really OLD did not stick to anything.JVCC REF-7 Engineering Grade Reflective Tape: 1 in. x 30 ft. (Orange)
3,"Good for Engineering, not a reflector","(Yellow) this is a quality engineering tape with quality adhesive, good target for TDMs. But it does not reflect brightly like a reflector."
3,Durable and Attractive but Reflectivness is Disappointing,I used this tape for creating lettering on a roadside sign. The reflective ability of the tape is adequate but not great. It does hold it's color well and has withstood a lot of outdoor sunlight and rain and still looks great. For my purposes I'd use it again but I do not expect it to draw a lot of nighttime attention.
5,on bike,"this stuff is on my bike so I can be seen, in the rain or dusk, makes me feel safer and I have seen it from a distance it really works."
4,Great Tape you do need to be careful,"A reviewer said:""I ... discovered some of this tape's limitations. It is relatively thin and somewhat brittle if you try to bend it too much. It flexes reasonably well along its primary axis (i.e. along its length) but trying to bend it width-wise led to some minor tearing.""I agree!However even though I did get tearing; with extreme care I did manage to wrap it around a tube without tearing. It does have that brittle feel, there is no stretch. The other good/bad point is it's extremely sticky. Once it touches the surface it is stuck. If you try to take it off it tends to tear.But if you are careful, once on, it's great. Shine a flashlight on it and it glows. The red is a apple red and matches the color of my bike. The roll has plenty of tape on it. It seems durable, only time will tell."
3,Meh,"The tape is alright. I got it for my footlocker and duffle bags that I shipped over for deployment to Afghanistan. Tape fell completley of duffle bags, but stuck decently (not great) to the footlocker. Reflectivness was slightly better than so so."
4,The genius of Rick,"I only discovered Rick James' genius, after his death. I liked him well enough, but needed more meaty stuff. I bought his last CD,(Deeper Still), released 3 years after his death, and its a beautiful piece of work. Rick finally grew up! That sent me buying his other CD's. This is one of them."
5,Great Service,"Basically this was my first time ordering from you guys, and I was fascinated by the service I recieved. My order was suppoosed to shipped to me within 7-10 business days and I got my product was here in 4 now thats what I call great service. I will be ordering from you guys more often. Thanks Alot."
4,More than just a pretty face...,"Billed as the ""female Dwight Yoakam"" Danni Leigh is clearly much more than a simple imitator. While Danni exhibits the same roots approach to her music and wry observations on life and love, she has clearly developed her own voice. Title track and ""Ol' Lonesome"" are standout tracks."
1,Beware...this is an abridged version of an Original Superior Biography!!,"The author came out with an updated, abridged version of the wonderful book ""Patsy"". This edited, chopped up version cuts most of the meat and potatoes out of the book leaving us with a condensed, mediocre, sad imitation of the original.Get the original version. The author has added virtually nothing new here. If he could have at least included a chapter on the making of ""Sweet Dreams""...the 1985 film starring Jessica Lange and how Patsy's husband and family felt about it would have been wonderful. Alas...it left me wanting the original...which I go back and read time and time again."
5,BEST DARN BOOK ON PATSY CLINE!,If you want to know the REAL Patsy Cline this is the book to read..The other books out there don't even begin to get it right..As far as i'm concerned THIS is the only book to read...Honky Tonk Angel has it all..No holding back..Ellis Nassour tells it like it was..Just like Patsy herself...Now stop reading this and ORDER THIS BOOK!Dustin K. Watson
5,What a Book!,"Last night my mom brought this book in for me to read! I am only 22 years old but love old country music, I haven't put it down since last night and have only 33 pages left.I am buying my own copy from Amazon as we speak, I just had to write and let everyone know what a terrific book it was! It is some very good work! EXCELLENT..................James from Texas"
2,Useful but dry.,The book/map is definately informative but also dreadfully dry. It is difficult to follow as it is in book format which doesn't lend itself well to large maps. I ended-up ultimately buying another map to take with me and use on my trip. Look for the National Geographic map for The San Juan Mtn. region instead.
4,JVC Remote,"It worked as advertised, for us. I took it out of the box, installed batteries, and the tv recognized it immediately. I wish it had the same option to work our VCR as the old JVC remote did, but I realize not too many people are probably using VCR's anymore. But our 3 year old could work the old remote for his occasional video, so it is a feature we'll miss a bit."
1,Didn't work as advertised,"I used to have one for my JVC TV before it got lost after a party. I finally got around to remembering this brand and how well it worked, so I purchased a new one. It arrived quickly, but all it will do is turn on the TV. Not even turn it off. It will not do any other function whatsoever. Totally disappointed with this."
5,It's a miracle!,"I used to own a beautiful JVC CRT television back in the day, and always remembered how much I loved the picture. So when I needed a CRT TV for my bedroom (for watching VHS tapes on) I knew I wanted a JVC. Amazingly I was able to find the EXACT TV I used to own at Goodwill used, but alas, it did not come with a remote.I've used universal remotes before and hate them because every time the battery dies you have to reprogram the darn thing. This remote requires no programming. Put in batteries and use!It sure it nice to be able to watch TV without walking up to the TV to change volume and channels (and be able to mute commercials) but the MAIN thing I needed was being able to switch video inputs for DVDs and video games.Not a single problem so far. Recommended for anyone who purchased a JVC TV and needs a replacement remote."
3,Remote for JVC TV,"Okay for a JVC universal. Not tons of features, but it does serve the purpose for minimum functions. Didn't expect a full fledged remote, and this one is not. Good value for money, but use it for only changing the input mode from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2, etc. Use DVR remote for all other functions."
1,works well but too pricey,The remote works just like the original however...I found a remote at WalMart for $4.95 that works just as well !Do not waste your $$ until you check out the ones available at local stores...save time and money !
2,Batteries in....no motion,"I got the batteries in and the music began...yippee, BUT there was no motion. We took the arm out of the music box and back in and heard the click several times, no motion.Great idea for a mobile...loved the design and possibilities, but not that much fun if it doesn't work."
2,Mobile is great could be more.,When I purchased this mobile over other mobiles I thought I made a great choice. The remote and the music are great. It just seems to get a little boring after sometime. I think it is great that you can reverse the pieces for different designs. If only it had a soft light you could turn on or off it would be even better. But for now it will do. I wish I could have tried the mobiles out before I purchased any.
5,great buy!,"I was a little hesitant to purchase this mobile, as it was a little more expensive than the others at my local store. Boy, am I glad I spent a few more dollars! This mobile is a great purchase! I have three month old twin boys and they both love it. They have the Fisher Price Aquarium on their crib as well, but when both are really fussy, only this mobile will calm them! They both lie in the crib and smile and coo at the shapes. I'm not sure if the music selections are a hit - I never play anything other than the ocean waves. Usually one round of ocean waves will put both babies to sleep, even if they are cranky. Like kymomoftwins, I am getting ready to move my boys into separate cribs, but will purchase another one of these mobiles before doing so!"
4,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"My six week old son has had this in his crib since he came home from the hospital and he just now discovered it and loves it!We turn it on when we put him to bed and he seems to like the ocean sound the best. He is now able to follow the toys with his eyes as the go around.The only negative thing is as someone stated above that if you bump it, it does make some noise, but he doesn't seem to notice.I highly recommend this mobile for another reason because once they outgrow it, the toys are detachable and can still be used!"
1,Died after 3 months,"Product was great at first- baby seemed to enjoy it. After three months and minimal use, the mobile no longer spins, but the music still plays. I've replaced the batteries twice with new ones -- not the problem. Three months old--- no returns allowed.Either I got a bad one or this product does not hold up well. Made in China, like every thing we buy."
4,Eye for Remote has to be on the left of your doorway...,"I purchased this mobile for several reasons, one being the remote control feature. However, once I got it home and installed on the crib, I learned that your crib has to be in a certain position in order for the remote ""eye"" to work. The ""eye"" is located on the right top of the music box that attaches to the backside of your crib. If your doorway is on the left of that eye, then it will not work. Other than the remote not working for my room set up, I thought it was well made and looked pretty entertaining... P.S. My nursery is a very small room. The doorway is no more than 10 feet from the crib and maybe 4 to five feet to the left of the crib location.I took this back and purchased the Symphony in Motion. It's very entertaining, a little loud because of the moving parts, and no remote...Hope this helps."
1,"Great Concept, Poor Quality","The first one we ordered wouldn't spin. The motor whirred, but there wasn't any ""motion"" in our music. Amazon promtply processed an exchange. Unfortunately, the second only worked for three days.Given the hassle of returns, I stop after two defective products. It's a shame, because the stop start motion is captivating. The music is also rather decent quality.If I was comfortable with the quality, I'd give this one four stars. But I can't recommend a product that immediately breaks two separate times."
5,A great product!,"This is one of our daughter's favorite toys. She is now nearly five months old and enjoys watching and listening to this fun and entertaining mobile as much as she did when she was much smaller. This was a simple product to put together and is well-worth the money. The batteries that we put into this mobile when we first bought it have not been changed, even though it runs several times each day, for the full ten minute cycle each time. I cannot think of a single complaint regarding this item and would strongly encourage you to think about purchasing this mobile either as a gift or for your own child. When our daughter out-grows it, we hope to hang onto it for our next baby!"
3,svkb mom,"Loved this mobile w/ the exception of the ""bonus"" detachable parts for your child to play w/ later...they contain rattles in each of the pieces and it can get quite tricky getting your baby in and out of the crib w/ out bumping the mobile and scaring your child. Even if you are putting your baby into the crib awake, to fall asleep on her own...it's enough noise to startle her to need you for a few more minutes."
4,Not Bad!,"My only criticisms are that the music comes out sort of tinny and mechanical sounding, and that, though you can detatch the toys and use them as rattles later, they have hard, plastic knobs in the middle of them (where they attatch to the arms of the mobile)from which I find myself protecting my little one again and again. Also, the shapes aren't so mesmerizing as all that. Stuffed animals seem to be preferred, but I guess that would vary from baby to baby."
2,Too Much,This was one of four different mobiles we bought in trying to find the perfect one for our daughter. The toys were stimulating which was not the desired affect when trying to have her sleep. It was nice that it had different song selections but they were all too loud. She would jump when we would start it and try to move away from it. A volume control should have been added. Needless to say it was returned.
4,Our baby loves this mobile!!!,"We had put off buying a mobile but as soon as we installed this into our 3 month old's crib, she was fascinated by it! The remote control is really great so you can restart it without disrupting the baby. I love that the objects on the mobile become toys. I love also the options of music for quiet times or play times. The only drawback to this mobile is that it takes batteries that will have to be changed. I can tell that my daughter will love this mobile for years to come as a music box that can stay attached to her crib while she plays with the removable toys."
3,mother of 2,"This mobile is great as a developmental toy, but when it comes to getting a baby to sleep, its not all that great. My daughter is 4 months old and loves to lie in her crib and look at it while i am cleaning her room or putting away laundry, but i don't use it when she is going to sleep. There is no volume control,the music plays too loud for sleeping, the rattles that hang off it make way too much noise, and the motor running with a stop and go motion is almost as loud as the music itself. The remote is a good idea, but i wish i had realized there was no volume control. I liked the mobile i had for my first girl, the old wind-up kind!"
2,Batteries...not an easy thing!,"I bought this mobile to go over the changing table. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem even before I tested it. The compartment for the batteries is made very poorly. It is hard to get the batteries in and to keep them in place. I tried for 20 mins to get them in right and eventually gave up. I'm sure the mobile is great, but first you have to get past this problem. I think it's just a design flaw."
2,But it squeaks like hell,"All right. I'll give you that it's neat to have the remote control. And that the designs flip over to accomodate the baby's maturing visual sense. But after three weeks, mine squeaks like a shoebox full of frantic mice. I've taken it apart, tried silicone lubricant, graphite powder, even a little WD-40. My husband suspects that our 11 week old likes the noise, but it's anything but soothing. The plastic works are hopelessly flimsy, and completely unfixable. There's got to be a better way!"
2,It didn't even fit the crib!,"We recieved this through our baby registry, but after putting it together, we noticed that it wouldn't even fit on our crib!! I guess Sassy didn't consider that not all cribs are built the same. Our crib sides were too thick for it to screw on. It would lean over. And once we turned it on, we noticed that you can hardly hear any sounds from it. Since there isn't a volume adjust, you have to strain to hear it. If these two things weren't a problem, we would LOVE this mobile."
4,Go one up!,"I actually couldn't get this one to work (I tried three different models in the store when I went to return it), so I tried the same brand, only one model higher- I think it might have been ...more [money], but it has additional toys besides the ones pictured that can be added later or played with separately. My son loves watching it go around, and I like that it plays three different types of sounds. My only complaints are that (1) the music is pretty loud, so I only use the waves sounds right now (2) the remote control doesn't work from outside the room like it is supposed to, because it has to be aimed at the unit, like a TV remote control. Otherwise, we are happy so far."
3,The Mobile I Love To Hate,"I put this on our registry after reading great reviews. There are many things I like and don't like about it.Like:* developmental components - different shapes, colors, and textures that interchange with the age of your baby* choice of white noise, classical songs, or lullabies* the remote controlHere's what I didn't like - the first one we purchased had a motor that didn't turn the arms, the second one didn't have the arms in the package, the third one developed a major squeak that we couldn't eliminate after using silicone spray and taking it apart....we're now on our fourth and last mobile. Because of these problems, I wouldn't recommend the product unless you don't mind many trips to exchange it for a new one. Three problems with one product seems to be a bit excessive."
3,Could be better,"Our daughter loves to stare at this mobile. Unfortunately, the mobile will stop moving while the music still plays. This happens often. Also, it eats up batteries. The remote control also lacks a button to keep the mobile turning. The buttons are olny good for the music & turning it on/off. What good is having the remote if it stops turning, and you have to go to the crib & get it going again?"
4,Remote has no distance!,"This is a great mobile and my son really loves it! The different ""levels"" of things hanging down is really nice. He did get bored with the pictures at about 4 months so we were able to switch over to the graphics/ball side. The only problem is that you have to have your body halfway in the room to get the remote to work. That's why it only gets 4 stars."
2,"Not well-made, but baby likes it","I thought this mobile was great because it was designed based on baby's development. My newborn liked it, as did her 6-month old cousin. I thought the versatility (teething toys, music box) was good. However, I had to return this twice--the first one was missing parts in the teething toys; the second one stopped rotating after a couple weeks. It was not worth the hassle of having to return it multiple times due to poor workmanship. And yes, it does make a funny noise when it rotates. The remote is cool, but basically useless, since I had to be right next to the crib for the remote to work. I finally gave up and bought a Fisher Price mobile for less money."
1,Does not work.,"I was very excited about this mobile and love developmental toys and stimulaters. Got it three days ago, assembled, put in batteries...nothing. Put in different batteries...nothing. Did not work at all. Returning it today."
2,Does not fit on crib,"I really wanted this mobile and received it as a gift at my baby shower. When we tried to attach it to the crib, it wouldn't fit because our rails are too thick. We tried everything to make it fit but it leaned and wasn't very sturdy. We had to return it for another mobile. I wish it was adjustable to fit all cribs because I really liked this mobile. If you have thick rails on your crib, think twice about this mobile."
1,Don't bother buying it!,"My husband and I couldn't get the batteries to go into this thing. I tried for 30 mintues (while my baby was crying his little head off) to get the batteries to go in the dumb thing. My husband couldn't get them in either, and he tried with a hammer. We thought it was a flaw and exchanged it for another one. We had the same problem again with the new one. We just returned it and got Tiny Love's SYMPHONY-IN-MOTION MOBILE-GEOMETRIC SHAPES. It's the best and my baby loves it!"
1,battery problem!!,how do you install the 2nd and 3rd battery into the battery slot? its so troublesome. i cant believe they designed the battery compartment in this manner. i want to return this item asap.
1,Frustration,"I would like to say how well this thing works, but you see the screws to the battery compartment are screwed in so tight it is impossible to open. We took the first one back to Toys R Us and they couldn't open it so they gave us a new one. Well guess what same problem. Last time I could get the remote opened, this time I can get one screw off the mobile. If it doesn't loosen by tomorrow, it's going back for good and I will choose something by another company."
5,My son's favorite toy,"This mobile is a must-have. We got it when my son was about 6 weeks old and he loved it from day one. He's three months old now and still adores it. It has not needed a battery change yet and is used several times each and every day. You can hear the motor running but it's very quiet and has not affected my son's enjoyment of the mobile at all. I bought mine new but also bought a used one for the crib at my mom's house and it works without any problems. I live in a small apartment and due to space and budget constraints, I consider every baby purchase carefully. Even so, I rate this a NECESSITY!"
1,Great idea - terrible product :(,We registered for this and recieved it at as a gift. We had to exchange it right away because after we finally had it all together the mobile rotated but the music box didn't work. When our son was less then two months old it started squeaking and now that he is almost three months old it has stopped rotating. It is now on it's way back to Babies R Us and we will not be bringing a 3rd one home. It is a wonderful concept and would be a great product if it actually worked properly for more then a few weeks.
2,Very cute ---- but that is it,I got this as a shower gift. I totally loved the fact that you could control this without entering the room. This was the best feature this thing had. After reading other reviews here and on other sites.. they were right IT REALLY DID STOP WORKING!!! Needless to say it went back and I got the Symphony Animal Mobile by Tiny Love.. It was $39.99 but the baby found it fascinating and made mommy's life easier for 20 mins.
2,Broke in 6 months,"I received this mobile and began using it when my daughter was a new born. She was mesmorized by it which gave me a little time. We turned the shapes over when she was about 3 months old and one of them was missing the beads inside. The remote stopped working after about 4 months even with new batteries and the whole thing has stopped rotating now that my daughter is 6 months. The only thing that still works is the music which is loud like others have said. I keep the bumper pad over the speaker. My baby did love looking at the mobile when it worked, but I'm disappointed that it broke already."
2,not as good as we expected!,"First it takes the skills of a mechanic to put this toy together!And it doesn't even have a lightbeam features like other similiar mobile toy.And last, who knows the 3 C battery are going to last ( 3 days or 3 weeks)?"
2,Too Noisy - Don't buy this product.,My baby loves all the Sassy products but this one missed the mark. Although my son loves the designs and music the beads and rattles make noise with the slightest movement. I have the mobile attached to the side of his crib and when ever I would put him to bed the beads would rattle and the noise would startle him awake. It would also make noise every time he would kick or move in his sleep waking him up. So although this mobile is pretty to look at I wouldn't get it if you want to get any sleep. I recommend a plush mobile ... something with out beads.
2,Doesn't fit our crib,"I couldn't wait to use this mobile. I loved the music and the mobile, but it doesn't fit on our crib because of how wide our top rail is. This isn't mentioned on the box. If your crib has a top rail that is over 2 1/2"" this isn't the mobile for your baby."
3,Thought it would be better,"I bought this mobile because it had a remote, but you have to be at the right angle for the remote to work. For me that is in my babies room. Also a volume control would be nice. It seems to be a little loud. I do like the fact that it has three different sound modes and I like the two different sides to the toys on the arm. I guess for the price I wish the remote worked better. Next time I will purchase a different one."
3,Quiet and Broken,"I registered for this mobile because it's stimulating and has many practical applications. What I discovered after using it was that the music box plays too quietly to use anywhere other than the crib. The volume is low and can't be adjusted.The remote control also didn't work.So, although I liked the variety of music that this mobile offers and the extended length of play, I ended up taking it back."
2,Mobile died,I've had this for 2 months now and the mobile no longer turns also. I've replaced the batteries and still nothing. Music works fine though. I think it should've lasted a little longer then 2 months.
5,Baby loves it,"I love this toy, it was perfect for my son. It took me sometime to find a mobile that the toys faced the baby. My son is 9 weeks old and makes all kinds of noises at it. It is great because it allows me to take a shower if he is awake and he be enterrtained. For nap time I just turn it on and he plays till he goes to sleep. The remote is great it allows me to turn it back on without him seeing me. This is a GREAT product."
1,DO NOT waste your time or money on this mobile!,"As a new mother, I thought the design of this mobile was a good choice. I purchased one for the nursery. First, it was difficult to put together. I needed to use the flat end of a screw driver to remove the piece that is used to hold the main arm. Once I got that off, I had trouble snapping in the little plastic arms to hold the mobile pieces. Finally, with pieces in tact I tested it out. It worked for one whole day. The rotating mechanism died. Frustrated (having tried new batteries), I returned it with no trouble at Toys R Us. When I got a second one as a gift, I thought, ""Why not give it another try?"". Very, very dumb. After all that trouble putting it together, the second one didn't rotate AT ALL. Turns out, my little angel is quite happy with the old fashioned wind up model."
1,Rip-off,"Colin Garrett has written only one book ""The World Encyclopedia of Locomotives"" and it has been endlessly repackaged along with ""GreatRailway Journeys of the world"" by Max Wade-Matthews. So far I have purchased 6 different books that are combinations of one or both ofthese titles."
3,Where is the audio CD?,"I purchased the text and the lab manual, but neither comes with an audio CD that is essential to learn correct pronunciations. I looked at the link for the audio cassettes, and they are ""out of print""."
3,The Soundtrack From The Arcade...,"Namco Video Game Music is effective for what it is: a reformulated version of some of the themes you heard while playing some of the more popular arcade games of the 80s and 90s. My main gripe about the album isn't even the fact that these aren't the original soundtrack recordings, but that the disc is ""write protected,"" meaning that if you want to record it to an MP3 format, you have to go through an extra and unnecessary step (i.e. playing it in a CD player, line in to your MP3 recorder) to make that happen. I was a serious addict of the game ""Out Run,"" so I felt compelled to purchase this disc. I suspect very few others will be so inspired, and those that are will probably want to just remember those tunes as they were. To sum up: this is a curio with a high price tag!"
4,"Good Camera, but fyi - no audio","I got these security cameras and even though the DVR that goes with them has space for an audio input, these cameras do not record audio at all. I didn't find that information in any of the product infos so i just wanted to let others know. Otherwise, they're great cameras, get good resolution and easy to adjust and set up."
1,Bad bad quality,"I purchased the LG DUPY10 a 50"" plasma model last year march. From the beginning I had numerous problems. Replaced digital boards twice and still same problems occurs every few months. Customer service is a joke.Go with superior quality brands such as Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer etc.I consider LG is the worst plasma manufacturer in the world."
4,It's Winston-like.,"If you are a George Winston fan, this is a must for your collection. It's a wonderfully relaxing group of well written songs. Watch for more from this talented artist. Go Blue!"
1,Wow this book was boring!,"The characters were sterotypes, the plot was trite and the writing ponderous. Halfway through it, I threw it across the room in disgust."
3,M Sasaji's Birdland is not my cup of tea.,"I purchased the SACD version (which is not available in the USA) of this album direct from Japan. I based my decision to buy this album on the comments of other audio enthusiasts who rated this album tops for both musical performance and sound quality. The album has won numerous awards in Japan.I can't deny that Birdland offers demonstration quality sound. In fact, I can't think of too many recordings in my collection that are its equal in this respect. But despite this, I am not all that enthused with the big band sound of the L. A. All Stars which will remind most listeners of Johnny Carson's Tonight Show band under the direction of Tommy Newsome: Brass instruments are very prominent in all of the arrangements, and the rhythms are generally very fast paced. If this sort of music is to your liking, you will be very pleased with this recording. On the other hand, this is nothing like the music of Basie or Ellington."
2,Update abt this book !,"I was recommended couple of books for my course and this was one among them. Though it touches the topic, the contents are brief and if you want more detail, this is not the right one."
2,This album is in pieces - literally!,"Again, I'm disappointed. I expected more from the ""King of Country."" This album is in pieces with no unifying theme or direction.The album is slick for sure, but it's not what his image leads you to expect. He is a commerical product for sure - but artistically he is not the strong artists you'd expect.This album isn't great! I'm alittle let down!"
5,Must have for cruising French Islands,"Kathy has got it all. We used this guide in the French islands in the Caribbean and we knew what we were ordering, could ask for certain foods or products at the market, find the boat parts we need replacements for, and explain what the engine was doing.Kathy's pages help to make complete sentences. Nouns are nice but who wants to go into a market and just say ""ham"". How about ""I would like twelve thin slices of ham""?Didn't need to know all the names for the pastries (although many are in the book). With Kathy's help I could point to the case and say ""this one, no the one behind it, yes, that one""!Asking directions was possible. Understanding them wasn't a bad experience either! grin. Occasionally we would find detailed weather reports posted on land. Hoorah! We could read them.Not a bad book for landlubbers visiting the French islands either."
5,Great Book!,"This book was a great book! I hate what happened to Jessica. She didn't know Will had a girlfriend. Did Melissa ever think about the cheating BOYFRIEND? Anywa, back to the point. It is so obvious that Conner likes Liz and I'm beginning ot think that Liz is falling in love with Conner. Some people think Conner is bad news, but he's soooo sweet!Also Recommended: All SVHSY and SVJH books."
4,What have you done to Sweet Valley?,"How could the twins have changed this much in so little time? For Elizabeth, leaving a meeting early was a big deal but now she is skipping meetings to go shopping with her new friends. Maria is chasing after boys- one in particular who another character is in love with. I could not believe what Maria was doing to Elizabeth, she seems out of touch with reality. Jessica is being snubbed by everyone including her sister, while Lila should just grow up and stand by her friend. Didn't Jessica believe her when Lila had the problem with John, and then when Lila was accused of being an arsonist? This book did move a little better than the previous one though, with more action. Email me at SweetValleyFan@hotmail.com"
3,Disappointed,"Say It To My Face was a disappointment to me. Since when has Jessica never fought back? I wanted Jessica to stand up for herself and get herself some new friends. Also what happened to Ken, Winston, Enid and Todd? This new series hardley ever mentions them and instead it focuses on the new characters, who I find some of them to be boring. I really hope that Sweet Vally High changes back to the way it use to be."
2,What can you expect?,"What can you expect? The first book, Can't Stay Away, is really bad? Say it To My Face is totally Boring and stupid. What happened to Jessica, why did I see her as a weak duckling that is about to die under HATEFUL Mellisa's feet? Why didn't she stand up for herself? As for Liz, i never see her as a airhead before, but now, she is one. Too bad, I WAS really looking forward to the new series with such high expectations that it will be really popular, but till now, it's quite a disapointment."
5,a minimal language,"this is the most important album of CUD.Almost, the feeling and the imagination in this record is a infinite expierence, based in the IMPROVISATION,i believe that, A CAN FEEL IT !!!!.LEMON GRASS,12 degrees of freedom and the pursued, beautiful songs that shows a minimal sound, combinated with spaces of nothingness.you can hear a VOID and feel your room like that! nothing? but the duo is great!"
3,Makers of World History,"This book was very interesting. There is a lot of good brief information on historic figures. However I rate this a three because Sowards some how managed to leave out one of the most important figures of all time; Jesus Christ. Sowards managed to include the founders of every major religion, except Christianity. Whether Sowards believes in Jesus as the Son of god or not shouldn't of mattered. The fact is that Jesus Christ is a historical figure and had a great impact on the world."
4,New Down South Anthem?,"I don't know about you...when I hear ""We Ready"" it makes me want to put on my gloves and handle somebody! Get Krunk!"
1,Just awful...,"Simply enough, ""Archie Eversole"" is not the man pictured on the cover of his album. Any rapper who name checks Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Saddam Hussein, and Bill Cosby within one minute of each other does not write his own rhymes; he has Carson Daly write them.There is little to review here. It's not even culturally significant, the one ""hit-single"" is completely obscure, and I'm not even going to bother reprinting the name of it here. I love 'Nsync and Puff Daddy, but Ride Wit Me: Dirty South Style is seriously MANUFACTURED. Carson's new album heavily differs from other ""Dirty South"" rap in that it has determinedly crappy beats and the most mundane lyricism this side of Lionel Richie.It's just awful. Archie Eversole is the Hindenburg of rap music."
3,"Holistic Health, but Allopathic in nature","A good book to use as a basic reference for those who believe holistic health is voo-doo or scary, but still a book that calls on the medical profession to define courses they don't understand. A better book on holistic health, and the combined approach of body, mind, and spirit, is ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,"" which takes the reader through modalities in the alternative health field, but also incorporates the mind and spirit."
5,This CD is extremely phat.,"I really like Faith's new CD entitled ""Keep The Faith"". After the loss of her husband Notorious B.I.G., I think she had to find a way to keep her self ahead in life. Once again she has climbed back to the top and created a really nice CD. My favorite songs are ""lately i"", and ""never gonna let you go"". They are really pretty songs. So to all you people out there who don't know about Faith Evans you better buy her CD and hold on tight because the girl is gonna take you away. Ya heard me? And one last thing you should remember, always ""Keep The Faith""!!!"
2,FILLER CD,"Most of the songs on Faith's sophomore effort sound like filler. THe only highlights include the three singles that were released from the CD: ALL NIGHT LONG, LOVE LIKE THIS (party anthems) and the quintessential wedding song NEVER GONNA LET YOU GO. All three were top ten hits on the Billboard charts helping the CD to sell over a million copies. The other songs are primarily unmemorable and heavily steeped R&B songs. If you're not into strong R&B then pass on this CD but if you like it from a decent singer like Faith then come get it."
5,Work well done on this cd!,"This album was excellant if you like a variety of songs. My favorite song of all time now is ""Never Gonna Let You Go."" I think the songs are fantastic and all the haters need to quit hating, she's better than most of the younger singers and she could probably coach alot of them to sing better and from the heart."
3,needs better material and production,"had never been a Faith fan, until I heard her sing some gospel tunes and I was blown away, yet I simply cannot support nor buy any of her cds because they simply do not capture the true essence of her voice, and she does have a beautiful voice. The track ""Never gonna let you go"" is nice and she needs to concentrate on ballads not dance tracks, and, most importantly, she needs to dump Puffy!"
2,Faith Evans is a Mary J. Blige knock off!,"Faith may have taken voice lesson but, I can't tell the difference in this album. I know many common people who sing better in the shower! Come on people, don't support this silly hype! She sounds like a cat caught under a car! Get real!"
4,Happily avoided the curse of the sophomore slump,"After releasing her excllent first CD,Faith really blew up when she appeared on the tribute song for her late husband Biggie Smalls. The first two singles,the irresistible dance/R&B cut Love Like This and its follow-up, the equally intoxicating All Night Long which still make me dance or roller skate. The ballads on the CD are also a strong point including the excllent Babyface written Never Gonna Let You and the sensual 112 featured Careml Kisses. All in all a fine album that highlights nineties soul at it's best."
5,This album is beyond belief!,"If you don't have this album, you are definetely in the dark! This album combines Faith's roots, maturity and talent into an hours worth of pleasure. I commend her for stepping back into the music scene with quality music and not some rushed compilation of songs. Faith you are truly blessed! Keep up the ""EXCELLENT"" work! I am already anticipating a 3rd album. I'm trying not to wear this one out too much, but it's truly hard."
5,SO BLESSED,"I have yet to hear an imitator of such an extraordinary talent. Faith has really made a name for herself and set a path for all aspiring female artists. Not only is she beautiful, but her voice represents her soul. She is truly a pure spirit. The epidemy of Diva-ism. Keep the Faith, Faith. We love you too, girl."
1,The album isn't that good,"After listening to Faith's album I said to myself that she could have done a better job. I like her voice, she could have done a better job with this album."
3,Faith is okay...,"I like her voice cuz it`s so pretty and unique :) but all in all her album is not good, not bad, just O K A Y! She could at least pick nicer melodies.some of the songs sound ""dead""...it makes me wanna sleep =/ but I guess its all good...it seems only the songs that come out on the radio are the good ones..."
3,YAWN,"I waited patiently for her to follow up her strong debut, but Im sorry, this CD is BORING. I can only listen to this when Im going to sleep. The songs are just bland. And lets not mention the uptempo ones. Yeah, she got heavy airplay, but ""get your groove on""? Come on, Faith. Love like this, another smash hit, but all it did was make me long for Chic (Chic Cheer).And I know you guys are loving 'Never Let You Go', but Im sorry, Diane Warnes is such a middle of the road, corny type of ballad writer. She's paid, has a lot of peeps paying for her songs, but this is too top 40 for someone who used to be as soulful as Faith.I hope her material improves next time around. She seems to have lost a lot of her edge."
3,only 2 tracks are truly worthwhile,"much better singer than Ms. Blige, but not necessarily a better artist. Love when she sings in a lower register; her soprano has a tendency to wail at times and many of her lyrics are cliche-like. Not really into the uptempo tracks. The album is saved by the ballads ""My first love"" and ""Never gonna let you go"". She would do much better from an artistist standpoint when she loses Puffy and Bad Boy. Needs to includes some gospel on her commercial albums. She does gospel beautifully."
4,I've Got The Faith Too!!!!,"A Mary Knockoff???...I don't think so...unlike Mary, Faith Evans can actually sing...Faith has proven herself as a songwriter and artist. Songs like ""Lately I"", ""Life Will Pass You By"" and ""Love Like This"" are testaments to her singing and writing talents. And let's not even talk about her first album. 'Nuff said. Good luck to Faith Evans in all future endeavors."
3,A little on the weak side,Her first album was better. I don't think she was really focused on this album (because of Biggie's death). I don't really feel any of these songs. And for God's sake does Puffy have to be on all of the dance songs!!!! Hope she keeps the faith with her next album!
5,FAITH EVANS is a God-sent Diva... she's an Angel of Mine!,"Mad props to my homegirl FAITH. You have outdone yourself. Keep The Faith is an explosive LP with some jammin hip-hop grooves, upbeat mid-tempo cuts, and some smooth ballads. My faves are My First Love, Lately I, Keep the Faith, and all 3 interludes. I love the First Lady till the day I die... she is my favourite and I gots nothin but love for her. Faith is truly the QUEEN OF R&B/SOUL and deserves much credit. Listen for her recent cuts with Eric Benet and Kelly Price and don't let her projects with LSG and DMX pass you by. Keep the faith forever. . . from Faith's #1 FAN. . . may God bless. Much love"
5,Faith Evans is a soulful diva who sings like an angel,"Although it has been a while, Faith came back stronger and more mature than her first cd. At first I was surprised because it is so different from the first, but after listening to the words and feeling the beats I realized that she is still the bomb!!!!!Go Girl!!!!!"
3,It was too slow and it could have been better,i was looking forward too getting this album and when i did it was a bit of a let down. there are some good tunes but most of them are too slow. I think you could of done better faith!
4,I was very please with the Album. Faith has done it again,Miss Evans has shown that she is not a one hit wonder. The album was all that and more. It was money wll spent.
5,BACK & BAD AS EVER,"FAITH EVANS HAS BEEN OFF THE SEEN FOR A WHILE, BUT THIS SISTA WITH THE POWERFUL VOICE IS BACK & BAD AS EVER."
5,keep the faith!,"this cd is hot! faith's sound is more mature, and her songs are more enjoyable to listen to. i recommend this cd to any r&b fan out there!"
3,solid follow-up,"ehhh,.. not as good as her first self-titled cd. but still solid. truthfully, i'd give it a 3 and a half star rating. there are no bad songs on this CD. standouts, however, are My First Love (#6), Caramel Kisses (#14), Anything You Need (#7), and Never Gonna Let U Go (#12). Love Like This (#2) is always a good party starter. pick it up. it's not bad; just not OUTSTANDING."
4,This CD gets up close and very deep!!!,"Faith Evans has a magnificent voice. For those who have really heard her sing live you know the difference from her voice and Mary's voice. Not to down Mary, but Faith's voice is like butter, it's smooth. Her song ""My First Love"" shows deep emotion and sincerity. This CD is not better than her first but it's still in the ranks. To Tasha, Faith didn't need Biggie and she didn't need Mary, but Mary needed her. Look at the credits on Mary's 'My Life' CD, Faith was writing for Mary. And as for her three baby daddies, that was her choice to have a child before her marriage to Biggie then he died, her life still continues. You don't have to take care of her kids so that shouldn't be any problem to you. Think about the things you say before you speak them."
5,Real Nice!!!!!!,"Faith has some mad pipes!!! She can sing!!! She has a sexy voice. She is so beautiful. Oh, the album is tight."
5,great read,A team of CIA operators is on a mission in China when they are captured by a hostile faction. Now a team of Delta Force operators need to rescue the CIA spooks and recover a stolen nuke. Very exciting read.
5,Highly suspenseful and entertaining from start to finish,"I've been looking forward to more like this from John Weisman since the last Rogue Warrior novel he penned, Detachment Bravo, and SOAR was even better than I had expected.I can't tell you anything about the story without ruining a few surprises, so I won't, but if you enjoy spec ops books like the Rogue Warrior series or Andy McNab's Nick Stone novels, you will love this. Highly suspenseful and entertaining from start to finish, you will have a very hard time putting it down. If you have to get up early for work, don't start reading it at night because you won't get to sleep on time."
5,Highly entertaining and very readable,"This book is not, nor is it meant to be, high literature.What it is, is a ""Guy"" book. Shooting. Violence that does not bloodstain or ruin the reader's clothes and speed.Duplicity by the Polititurds, whose very existance make any decent soul want to retch with ANY contact they force on thenumb electorate.Weisman has done better, but most of all a book should entertain, and that is exactly what this one does.Weaknesses are to be overlooked or forgiven. This is purely male fiction, not a guide for the wimp class to conclude foreignpolicy by.Read it and enjoy.Better yet, sip some Talisker and chew on a Don Tomas Classico while reading and find an enjoyment multiplier."
5,A true godsend!!!!,"This is truly a godsend!!!! It breaks everything down on a level that you can really understand. If you are taking lessons and seem a little lost, grab this book and soon you will at the top of your class."
2,Disappointing.,"The book references the tv show ""Deadwood"" much too often. I didn't know if I was reading about the ""real"" Deadwood or the tv version. I was very disappointed."
3,"Interesting, but not great!","Mildly interesting, but hardly worht the money, I started reading the book the same day it arrived and finished it in about three hours. Large pring, double spaced. Too easy, a read, for an adult.A few too many references to HBO."
4,a good read,I found this to be a pretty good read. Some interesting historical background on Deadwood and some of it's more notorious residents and visitors of it's early years. I would recommend this book for those that enjoy reading on Deadwood and the northern Black Hills in general.
1,Poorly researched,"This book plays fast and loose with the facts and is all too ready to spread rumors, myths and cliches. For example, the book posits the myth that Mark Twain visited Deadwood. Sounds great but its not true. Cite a source. A waste of trees and your time."
2,Very unsatisfying 'history' of Deadwood,"If you're a rabid fan of ""Deadwood,"" the TV series, as I am, this is a book you should avoid. I'm sure the author is a fine fellow and a talented writer, but...this book is extremely disappointing. It's an hour's reading, and that includes plenty of padding--15 pages, for instance, on frontier medicine and plenty of stuff that has nothing to do with Deadwood. The book is vastly underresearched--a simple Google search will tell you a lot more about Deadwood. It shows signs of being hastily written. (Publisher to writer: ""Hey write us something about Deadwood. We can capitalize on the TV series."" Writer to publisher: ""How soon do you want it?"" Publisher: ""Yesterday."")The only thing in the book that's really interesting are four or five photographs--of Hickock, Calamity Jane, Seth Bullock. If you want to see them, don't bother to buy the book. Instead, search Google images under ""Deadwood."" Or try some other book."
2,The Real Deadwood,Dissappointing. Not enough about the characters. Too much reference about the television series.
2,"Please, do not wast your time.","This was a very quick read, and not a very detailed book. I would wish the book to go into more detail, and not have so many references to ""Deadwood"" the HBO show. If I wanted to know all that, I would watch the show.I would not recomend buying this book. It does not go into detail at all, is very basic, and leaves you hanging.Once you find a part that actually interest you, it comes to an abrupt end and seems like some of the pages detailing the story fell out."
5,Great machine except for 2 issues,"The pill dispenser is great. It works as advertised. I have found only two issues with it after having it for a couple of months:1. I did not see any way to control the volume of the alert sound. It is very loud, and you can hear the alert beeping down the hall in my dad's apartment complex.2. This issue is not the fault of the pill dispenser. The dispenser is very good at reminding my dad to take his medicine, but when he removes the pills from the machine, he sometimes does not actually take the pills. He just leaves them on the counter, goes off to do something else and then forgets to take the pills. The real problem comes when the next alert comes 1/2 a day later and he has not taken the first set of pills yet. There is a danger he may take both sets of pills at the same time."
2,Have you heard of Chutzpah?,"And I actually don't mean the kind that it takes to put out an album like this... I mean the group CHUTZPAH. Go look/listen to their albums. Eponymous by Chutzpah is great. Fun, Jewish Hip Hop with strength and a 'tude.If you want your Jewish hip hop - straight up beautiful... find Ta-Shma's Come Listen.If you want Jewish and classic/funny... try You Don't Have to Be Jewish.Enjoy!"
1,old news,"so there's a lot of Jewish hip hop out right now and these guys just don't hold up...This is as bad if not worse than MOT. It's just not even trying to be good. If you want to hear some good hip hop with good music, check out Matisyahu or Chutzpah."
1,"Great for blind dates, not much else","I can't believe this album is actually still in production! I used to own this about a bazillion years ago, back in high school and I got a big kick out of it...for maybe the first couple of times I listened to it. After that, it got worse with each successive playing until I basically had to throw it away.Satisfy your curiosity with the 30 second RealAudio soundclips provided here, laugh and run away from this album. Unless, of course, you just want something you can play in a car for your blind date whom you have no desire to see again. :-)"
5,Amazing...,I think this is one of the most profound books i have ever read. I highly recommend it!!!
5,Picture doesn't do it justice.,"Due to an issue with the post office, I did not get my knife as quickly as I would have liked, but Josh @ Knive Country was great and placed a second order quickly.All I can say about the knife itself is that it is beautiful! I now understand why the recipient of this present said it is a knife he would pass down. It has a nice weight to it and it is Sharp! To whoever decides to purchas this: you won't be disappointed!"
5,Great handbook,"This is a wonderful, comprehensive handbook that is appropriate for new proofreaders and as a reference for experienced ones."
4,Yes it's loud...,But the music is very cute and bouncy. Weebles music seems to be more enjoyable than other toys that get increasingly annoying. We got this toy a year and a half ago and it still looks new. The kids still play with it. We love weebles stuff. To lower the volume we put quite abit of tape over the speaker holes inside the door. It helps muffle it a little bit.
5,Can't stop listening,"I have had this CD since last fall but pulled it out again after I saw James Yorkston perform in NY earlier this week. If you like Nick Drake but want something that sounds more hopeful, James Yorkston is it.There's really gorgeous, gentle arrangements that are delicate as air and continue my love of contemporary Scottish bands. Acoustic guitar, harmonium, piano, violin and percussion form the background but Yorkston's got this soft plaintive voice that's heartfelt and sincere."
3,If you like Belle and Sebastian....,"...don't buy this album! ""Moving up Country"" is criminally overrated... It's simply mediocre. The worst thing about it is how good it could have been. I wanted it to be as minimalist and subversive as early Palace, as intellectual as B&S, and as tuneful and inviting as Ida, but it's not. It has all the significance of Elastica... or whatever, just another blip on the radar screen of mundane, here-today-and-gone-tomorrow Britpop. The album's weakest point is Yorkston's lyrical abilities. His lyrics read like the musings of a disaffected ninth grader, only less sincere. His deadpan delivery might work for a more impressive songwriter, but Yorkston only ends up sounding bored with himself... and I can understand why."
1,If I could give 0 stars I would,"When I saw this magazine on amazon, it was not made clear that they don't have a set publishing schedule, which is CRAZY for a magazine. Even though it says you can cancel for any reason, I now am getting the runaround. Amazon says to go through the publisher. The 'publisher' says to go through Amazon. Do not buy this subscription unless you don't mind getting taken."
3,countrys best canins,just wanted the october issue for my neices cabin was on front cover canceled the subscription because like i said just wanted magazine with my neices cabin on front page
3,DRIPS!,"I bought this because most of the reviews said it didn't drip. I must be doing something wrong or my applicator is defective. At least a third of the glue stick ends up on the mat. My other, least expensive glue gun, dripped less. Bought this one because the glue kept clogging the other one. Not the problem with this one, the glue runs freely onto the mat, better than onto my project."
1,Not at all impressed!,"I read all the raving reviews and said this must be the McDaddy gun. NOT! So far with two weeks of use it doesn't hold my glued areas. The glue ends up in a nice flat shaped spot but not sticking. Fifteen to twenty minute warm up, glue looks good and hot but I guess not. Not any better than the $10 guns from Walmart. Don't waste your money on this product."
5,Outstanding product,"Compared to the Craftsman glue gun I've been swearing at for a long time this 3M gun is a dream come true. Long, skinny snout fits into tight places, heats quickly and does not leak or drip once in use. I forgot to unplug it overnight and I was surprised there was no mess in the morning. Somehow it prevents glue from melting unless you pull the feed trigger. Comes with 2 removable bench stands to pick from. I removed the rear one as the front one supports it fine plus folds back when it might be in the way. The rear stand is more stable but I found it got in my way too often. The large, long feed trigger allows precise feed control for small glue jobs. I would not recommend using cheap glue sticks however as I suspect they are what causes the leaking problems posted in other reviews. I ordered the Surebonder 725R510 sticks with the gun and no probs. This is a very well engineered tool & I highly recommend it."
4,A good reliable product,ProsThe item was delivered on time.It carries out its described function well.The fitted illuminator is a useful addition.ConsThe item to my mind is a little overpriced.The addition of a spring shaped power cable would save inadvertent cable damage.
4,:Urban Cool:,"Heiko Meile of Camouflage helps Sea of Sin, from Germany, craft a smooth synth rich CD. In the spirit of Camouflage or Cause&Effect, this duo's debut full play has all the elements that should please any fan of synth-pop: Flowing melody, layers of snappy electronic sounds, and in this case a mixture of guitar and piano. Also the vocals, lyrics, and harmonies combine well with the beats and vibe>>>There are some upbeat tracks like ""Illuminate,"" ""Strange Vibrations,"" and ""Sin.cerity,"" that are cool as well as a couple slower ones like the deep ""I Live My Life"" and the Beatle-esque ""I'll Be There,"" which is groovy.Other favs: Ride The Sky""/""Deep Inside""/""Afterworld."" Peace out to the Synth World..."
1,0 stars?,"This book is absolutely worthless. It's extremely thin, and the contents are insulting to anyone's intelligence. I threw this in the trash and ordered ""Trail Guide to U.S. Geography"" instead."
1,I couldn't stop laughing,"This duo sounds like they seriously think their music is worth paying money to listen to, and it is, only not for the reasons they think it is. ... With lyrics that don't have any relevance towards anything except the title of the song (if that), and with lyrics that don't even rhyme half of the time, this album is outright embarrassing! So much so that it is really really really FUNNY! I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire duration of this album. It's worth 1 star just for the fact that it will make me laugh for the rest of my life"
5,Storage is Great,I purchased for my daughter for her's son room. Worked great in the closet and holds all his bath towels and cloths. She loves to be organized with his room.
3,weird one,"Iam not too keen on this one, its eclectic and imaginitive, but not real listenable, for occasional use only."
5,I've got to have this CD! Release More!!,"Without a doubt, the best work ever from C&J. I don't know why they won't make it readily available. Its like keeping the Mona Lisa in a broom closet."
5,astonishing talent with great originality,I have nothing but good things to say about this album. I have very high hopes for these guys. This disc is flowing with life and genuine talent. A truely delightful experience. Definately would pick this up if you like Leftover Salmon
2,It doesn't compare to the IDog,This is cheesy. There are only 3 lights that randomly blink and the the guitarist strum is more like a jiggle and doesn't go with the beat. The head is like a bobble head but doesn't do anything unless you jiggle it. I would not recommend this product.
5,Good!,"Of The Madonna Albums I Own and I Have purchased or listened to. This ranked at Madonna's third best effort. Erotica is # 1 and Bedtime Stories # 2. But this album is also very good. It has good dance tracks, it has a great ballad. The music is good. Catchy and overall it is a great album. it includes some of her famous songs ( Papa Don't Preach the LP's biggest track). Open your Heart, Live To Tell and the incredible La Isla Bonita and also the title track which is probably my least favourite song on the Album. but it is good. I am though amazed it is a bit overlooked in madonna's cataloug if you look at it nowadays. Which is pretty strange cause it is not only one of her best albums but it is also her biggest selling Album. If You see this in stores buy it."
1,Remastered by someone who was tone-deaf!,"True Blue is definitive Madonna 1986. When I first heard this album, I decided that Madonna was a true musician, on her way to the top. So somewhere along the line, I lost that 1986 release to an ex-wife or ex-girlfriend.This remastered CD is terrible! You know those idiots who drive by your house with the thump! thump! thump! issuing from their rolled-up windows? The people that they put up Noise Ordinance signs for? Well, that same tone-deaf moron remastered a beautiful album. The vocals (and hence the lyrics) are buried beneath an over-powered 120dB bass and a hisssssing 100 dB percussion.After buying this remastered garbage, I couldn't wait to go an buy a used copy of the original. My recommendation? Save your money on this remastered album, and buy the original 1986 release! js"
3,Advice from a 70's Rock fan,"As far as I know there is no ""Best of Madonna"" collection. That would be a CD I'd give 5 stars! However, all her albums I listened to so far contained s o m e good songs (the one under review: Papa don't preach, Live to tell, True blue, perhaps La Isla Bonita) but the rest is quite average. Maybe I'm just too demanding but I'm spoiled by bands that manage to deliver albums w i t h o u t any flaws, pieces of art like (now listen up Madonna fans to some real stuff!) :The Beatles ""St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band"" (and others), the Moody Blues ""Question of Balance"" or ""Every good boy deserves favour"", Sparks ""Kimono my House"", Slade's ""In Flame"", Queen's ""Killer Queen"", Steppenwolf's ""Monster"", Pink Floyd's ""Dark side of the moon"". These are more on the ""melodious"" side. Not to mention various flawless ""heavier"" artifices from YES, Rare Earth, Santana, Robin Trower, Emerson Lake & Palmer, etc. Good old times...."
2,Madonna can do better than that,"I really love Madonna, but this CD is just nuts!!!!! I love her old songs, i bought this CD because it is old, its made in 1987. I thought it would be better, mabe 3 or 2 songs are good out of the hole cd. I would have happily picked 1 star, but i didn't because i love Madonna."
3,Childhood Memories,"I haven't listened to this remastered version, though I'd like to, but I must say that I spent most of my girlhood dancing around my basement to this album. In fact, I think it was one of two tapes I listened to for 2 years straight. (The other one-- actually a record, not a tape--was Footloose, the Soundtrack. Though my musical tastes have drastically change, I still like this album in all its pop fluffiness. However, the only song I think is genuinely magical is ""Live to Tell"". I love it just as much as I did back then. The only ridiculously bad song is ""Jimmy Jimmy."" It gives me the willies. Skip over it."
5,1980's Classic Madonna cd,"This cd, comes really close to greatness of Madonna's Erotica cd.It is a true 1980's classic, from start to end.This cd, has three epic and beautiful songs 'La isla bonita', 'Papa don't preach' and 'Live to tell'.Then there is the song 'White heat', with the gangster talking at the begining. This is a great touch.There are great party songs on here like 'True blue', 'Open your heart', and 'Wheres the party at'.The remixes on this remaster, are also great. This is a great starter for any one wanting to get in to Madonna. It is just simply great."
4,Excellent,"This album is where she found her niche (in my opinion). This was her most grown-up sounding album (at the time) and was the first to feature heavy writing credits from Madonna herself. There are a lot of gems on this CD, even some non singles:True BlueWhite HeatJimmy JimmyPapa Don't Preackto name a few..."
4,My Review,"Some might find it funny for some reason but for the most part I listen to stuff like Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne, I dont know why they would think it's such a big deal but some people just do. Maybey Madonna doesn't fit the image of a heavy metal fan but oh well I gues I have an open mind, if it's good music it's good music right ? Anyway Im a huge Madonna fan and I think this is by far her best album.My favorate songs are definatly Open Your Heart, Live To Tell, Papa Dont Preach, La Isla Bonita and White Heat, I dont mind the others's but I dont think they are as good as the ones I listed.This remastered version is unbelievable, the diference in quility is amazing and even if you already own the original do yourself a favour and pick this one up, you wont be disapointed."
4,Classic 80s pop,"TRUE BLUE is a classic dance/pop album of the 80s. Some huge hits were spun off this album such as ""Papa Don't Preach"", ""Open Your Heart"", ""Live To Tell"", ""La Isla Bonita"", even ""True Blue"" and ""Where's The Party"" were minor hits. The album may sound a little juvenile but it's a fun classic party album. Definately the song that gets me going is ""True Blue"" with its infectuous flat drum beats and her fun vocals, ""Open Your Heart"" is another song that does it for me. Madonna makes social commentary on ""Love Makes The World Go Round"", which is a fun song. ""White Heat"" is another highlight on the album. ""Jimmy Jimmy"" is alright but kind of annoying with the background vocals> There's also an extended version of ""La Isla Bonita"" and The Color Mix of ""True Blue"". This is classic 80s, everyone should have this album!"
5,FOREVER ONE OF HER BEST!,"This album is truly one of those that will define the sound of 80's music for all time. There is so much I can say that has already been said so if anything I'm just here to add more fuel to the fire. ""Live To Tell"" may forever be my favorite song by Madonna. It is truly a deep and melodic song that is accompanied by an album of equal stature."
4,I enjoyed this cd,"This is a great cd by Madonna love all the songs. She is a great artist, and still looks good today."
4,Of course it's worth it!,"The most important thing about this album: ""True Blue"" is such a fabulous song, you must buy this album to hear it - and believe me, it's worth it. While it isn't my favorite Madonna album (Immaculate Collection really does it for me) what ""true blue"" Madonna fan doesn't love ""Open Your Heart"", and get emotional over ""Papa Don't Preach""? Also, some advice: DON'T buy ""And you Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead"" if you're looking for more of this Madonna's music it's not hers - many people have made that mistake so far."
5,Madonna's Very Best Album,"This is Madonna's best album of all time.Her album with the most hits as well.My favorite track on this album is ""La Isla Bonita"".I am glad she still sings this song at all of her current shows.""Papa Don't Preach"" is classic Madonna at her best, I wish she would still sing this one. ""Open Your Heart"" is another classic,It is still a favorite among Madonna fans. The titled cut, is a teeny pop song but its still an awesome track,it's probably my second favorite track on the album. ""Live To Tell"",another great ballad from Madonna. ""Where's The Party"" is a very underated song that should of been a single, it would of guaranteed Madonna another place in the Top 10. The remaining two tracks ""Jimmy Jimmy"" and ""Love Makes The World Go Round"" are just good but not single material type. This album still remains Madonna's biggest selling studio album, Make sure you pick up your copy today!"
5,tru blu,I agree too many times on this s ite somethingis listed with no other information about waht you are evn buying
2,This model sucks,"Recent years people have been saying DELL computers, desktop and laptop, deteriorated dramatically in quality and service is bad too. I don't know other models but this one sucks. I bought Dimension 2400 with 2.66 GHZ CPU, 40GB drive and 128 MB RAM with XP Pro. I did not see it too slow. The two USB port on front are located at bottom and it's awkward to use them even you put it on desk. When I tried to upgrade it problems happened. There are only limited connection port on the back. There are not many slots available for ungrading cards or RAMs. The total Max RAM can only reach 1 GB. There is only one Hard Drive bracket in the case. This scuks to the maximum. Only DELL parts can fit in and it took customer a lot of time to find out the part number. DELL ask $25-40 plus shipping for that damn metal bracket. A lot of people used a piece of metal from Home Depot to build their own bracket and installed a second drive."
4,"E, ""You Rock My World""","One cannot fathom how E still puts his mind into songwriting due to the death of his mother and suicide of his sister. But he does, and this is the outcome. Huge hit singles ""Cancer For The Cure"" and ""Last Stop: This Town"" are reason enough to buy this album. The raw energy that dominated the debut might be missing, and the hooks not as immediate, but you won't forget this in a hurry."
2,not bad but not all that good,"i bought the album pretty soon after it came out. because i really liked that song Last Stop, This Town. I listened to the rest of it during my spare time and found that almost all of it was very not very good and getting one to feel depressed seemed to be the common aim for most of the songs, got to hand it to E about creativity, however. the only other song i thought was allright was 3-speed."
2,Definitely not worth full retail price!!,"The debut Eels CD was very good and I expected ""Electro-Shock Blues"" to at least equal it. I was wrong. Half the material is worth listening too, whilst the other half is pure junk. I would only recommend it if you absolutely must have everything they have recorded but I do NOT advise paying full retail for it -- half price for half an album."
2,Aargh! Why did I buy this???,"Their first albulm was brilliant - this tries so hard to copy it but none of the songs are memorable at all. ""Cancer for the Cure"" is passable, ""Last Stop: This Town"" has a few redeeming qualities, but in all the other songs on the album you can hear parts of their first album sneaking through but not quite getting there. I was really looking forward to this album - waiting for a song to challenge ""Your Lucky Day In Hell"" or ""Novacaine For the Soul"". It doesn't happen. Maybe I was expecting too much - their first album was a masterpiece, so how could they better it? From this album I would have to say they didn't even try."
3,surprisingly good.,"Given how much I hated ""Beautiful Freak"", catchiness of Novacaine for the Soul aside, I was surprised by how good this is. Standard indie pop fare, to be sure, but very well done and with just enough darkness to balance the conceit."
5,beautiful,"i must say this is one of the best cds i have ever purchased. Sure, its not as good as beutiful freak, but, dude, its good! Its just so dark and soft, but different from ANYTHING i have ever heard. now, being a PanterA, MetallicA, Slayer, etc fan, it may be hard to belive i like it, and i dont like it. I LOVE IT! so go out there and do me, yourself and the world a favor...get this cd."
5,"Awesome, Original, Hard Hitting Album","Remo spits the truth in hard hitting easy to follow lyrics. I rarely ever buy music anymore, but this was definitely one artist I wanted to support. He is obviously very informed, about everything from the dangers of flouride and aspartame, to the treasonous coverup of what really happened on 9/11. This is the future of hip hop."
4,Excellent travel tool for viewing ruins,"This would be a great book to carry with you as you tour Israel. The artistic recreations of what the ruins used to look like are so helpful. I went to Israel once before, and even though the tour guides do their best to describe what the ruins looked like, a picture *is* worth a thousand words. This book covers major cities/ sites mentioned in the Bible, not just Roman or Crusader times which are often the emphasis in museums over there. Summaries of Biblical stories accompany the pictures. My only reason for not rating it a ""five star"" is that I wish it covered even more archaelogical sites. There are 14 overlapping illustrations superimposed over the photos of the ruins."
4,Bad information-Good Quality,No where on the item information does it indicate that you could receive mutiple colored purses. It only shoes pink. It should indicate that you could receive other colors. I orderd 6 purses for my bridemaids and I got all different colors when I only wanted pink. I am satisfied with the quality of the product and this is why I will give it a 4.
4,Unexpected delights,"I'm not sure if the reviews give this book justice. I mean, I read the back, and I'm like, this sounds dumb, another teen pity problem. But I was pleasantly surprised when I read this how absolutely adorable this book is! The Mr. Peck writes in first person for Drew, and boy, he is some clever and witty! I had to break and laugh out loud for a while every once in a while during the course of the book. The story mainly focuses on Drew and Steph and them discovering what an amazing and fun woman their grandma, Connie, is, and that sometimes the best things in life sneak up on you if you don't watch them. This book was fun, though I was kinda sad by the end, but overall it was a feel good read. Definately sweeps you away to the cruise ship and the magic of travel."
4,A divine love of life,"A Short Album About Love describes itself perfectly. Neil Hannon gives away in only seven songs all the complexity of love of any kind. Friendship and passion,bliss and pain, feelings are expressed just as well with words and music. With the usual baroque arrangements, and a modest arrogance, the bnad prooves that a pop song is not always a easy-to-write or easy-to-remember song, even if it's a love song. To those who liked Casanova more than to those who preferred Fin De Siecle, A Short Album About Love is a typic Divine Comedy album."
4,True Lies had me crying . . .,". . . happy tears at the end. I was seriously concerned that Dajah was going to fall for the uninspired, immature and totally inept Rick. I was too thrilled to see her walk away from a relationship that had no substance and nowhere to go. Rick and Gina were two pitiful characters who definitely deserved each other; neither had the intellect of a flee. I truly felt sorry for their daughter who, even at an early age, was being taught nothing positive and (considering who her parents were) had no positive role models to emulate. I kept hoping that the daughter would be placed with a foster family who could nurture her and give her a real chance at a future.Another very interesting read, Ms. Johnson-Hodge. Four cheers!!"
3,a bit dissapointing,"As a fan of Margaret Johnson Hodge's previous novels I must say that this book really surprised me- I wasn't totally happy with it. It starts out a little slow, there were a lot of unnecessary details in the beginning, and the ending left me cold. While some aspects of this book were very realistic the ending seemed to be the exact opposite. Hodge depicts the ups and downs of a romance between two good people who must face the challenges that come from a ""baby's mother"". The pair must decide should they tough it out and stay together or go their seperate ways. If you are a Hodge fan or you like books with relationship issues and drama read this book and make your own decision- but be forewarned the ending might slay you."
3,It was okay....,"I expected this book to be good reading all the reviews on it, but I was truly disappointed when I started reading it. For one, the writing was awful and choppy. Too choppy. The storyline was a good idea, but the writing took away from it being a good book. Overall I would rate this book 3.8. Not recommended."
5,All TOO FAMILIAR,"I have to say this book was really good. Although I hate all of the drama that surrounds the whole baby mama thing I have to admitt this book comes correct. I personally felt like Rick was way to soft for Gina( the baby mama) and Dajah was way to patient with Rick. I KNOW it takes alot to deal with a man that has a child by someone else, but Rick and Gina stepped on her toes once to many times for me. I say if you want a feel for a real true to life relationship with men and their baby mother's pick up this book, but I suggest you find a man with no kids. The headache is no where near worth the man!"
2,"Stay far away, unless, maybe if you live in a dry place like AZ.","They stopped working after a year on my boat. I am looking at buying a normal car speaker with rubber surround and aluminum/etc cones, basically the same, and I could get 4 speakers like that for the price of these that only lasted one season. Very disappointed. They did sound very good driven directly off the Sony stereo head with no amp so I am looking for and RMS/maxRMS similar since the 300 watt speakers would sound like crap off of stereo power. I don't want an amp that can go bad as well. For your comparison I live in saltwater area that is humid (Tampa Bay). Compared to VHS technology/ being waterproof, these should not be rated marine, then again a lot of stuff should not be. However they should last more than one season."
5,AWESOME !!!!,Speakers are great. Replaced old speakers with these new ones. It took 15 mins. to install and the quality is outstanding.
5,Old but great!,Knew it would be old since this is a very old book. As expected and pleased. Love the info in it
4,My new favorite band,A fantastic live album that hits many different styles. The musical journey Wake up > Lands End is total killer. I can listen to it over and over. The only drawback is Walk This a Way a waste of time that keeps this disc from getting 5 stars. I can't wait to see them live.
5,Great newgrass jams,"Instrumentation is acoustic guitar, keys, bass, drums, mandolin, accordion, etc. If you like ""Newgrass"" type jams, you will enjoy this. Experimental and freewheeling, with a fusion sound that is reminiscent of Bela Fleck. Worth a listen if you like rootsy, freeform jam music."
4,"good representation of their live shows, but not the best","this is a good live album from them performing in their hometown of boulder. they are my favorite band, and i must say this is most likely their best album for sale. however, they are a taper-friendly band, and some of their best shows are those not for sale. if you truly like the band, and you have a high-speed internet connection (cable, dsl, t-1, etc) i definitely recommend visiting the site etree.org, downloading the 3 or 4 programs needed, and begin trading shows. this is the method in which you will be able to receive some of their best shows (such as the 6 disc hornings hideout show with some of the best performances of many great songs). great beginner/introductory album, but too short for the hardcore pirate."
2,Not very useful,"Good expose of analyst's trade and inherent biases, especially in the bull 90's. However, with regulation FD, and the frequent trading of Zack's system, it is unlikely to be very profitable going forward.I was also dissappointed that the author not so subtly points the reader to the Zack's online pay service ranking system. He essentially builds the case for why you should sign up. Furthermore, the writing style and syntax was simple and dry, not up to the author's Ivy pedegree. Likely intended for the mass-audience."
2,Earnings Matter for 300 pages,"This is a marketing ad for Zack's and the only thing the book offers is that earnings matter (past, present and future) and oh yes Zack's algorithm is the best so subscribe."
3,cheap stuff,"the little one is light, easily slipped off. the big one as a chair doesn't feel like it can support me, and I am 190lb.a bit disappointed in terms of quality, but it's 30 [...] so, can't complain.resolution: use the little one on carpet. use the big one as a chair for someone lighter than 180 lbs."
5,Great ottoman set!!,I love this ottoman set. It is the perfect price and perfect size. We have a small home and don't have room for a coffee table so I got the brown ottoman so we'd have something to put our feet up on and for the extra storage. It looks great and is the perfect height to put your feet on. I didn't experience any of the strong odor that some other reviewers were talking about.
4,A lot of usefulness in a little space,"We have a small family room, where we often gather for conversation, TV or video games. Seating is always at a premium, especially when the kids have friends over. I bought two of the ottoman sets, and I am very glad I did. These are very useful - seating for additional people, or an easily portable side table, or an ottoman that easily moves out of the way. When not in use, they sit together against a wall, and give a nice look to the space. The only reasons I did not give them 5 stars are that they are not genuine leather. The vinyl was stinky for a few weeks, and I don't expect that they will last very long, but they were a very good value for the price. The smell has already faded, so if they hold up for longer than a couple of years, I will happily amend that to five stars."
4,Pleased,"I researched these Ottoman's for a few days before making my final decision. I read all the other reviews and searched about every furniture website you can imagine. These Ottomans are really great. The tray on the flip side is super handy. The only downfall (as I read in a review before purchasing them) is the smell. There definitely is a distinct gasoline odor. I put them outside for a week, sprayed them with dusting cleaner and used a leather rub....the smell is finally gone. :)"
4,"very good product, great deal","similar ottomans are found in crate & barrel for $200 (they are made of leather though)this is a good quality product, a wee bit uncomfortable to sit on for a long period of time, but otherwise fine. very usefull, we purchased two and love them!"
3,misleading advertising/buyer beware,"I recieved the ottoman set, love it. the only thing when purchasing it at a gold box deal was the misleading title of buy-one-get-one-free ottoman ""set"" (which is 2 pieces). these are sold as sets and when purchasing them on this advertisement they split the set into 2 pieces and I was only sent one set, amazon explained I got the ottoman with in insert only and not another completed set as advertised. very disappointed with this add. I called amazon and was given the run around between amazon and the company that merchandises these Item. Amazon did give me a phone number for the global distinctions company, when I called the number it was for a global hair extensions."
3,Global Distinctions Ottoman Set,"I have actually enjoyed using this product. I am a psychotherapist and I use this in my practice both as extra seating and as a prop for relaxation therapy. I have two complaints about this product. The ottomans had an intense vinyl smell which gave me a headache at first. (The smell eventually faded after a couple of weeks.) And, the product is made in China. I had to tear the tags off before my husband saw them and made send them back. Be patriotic, save American jobs, buy Made in USA whenever you can."
4,great value!,"I thought this item was a great value. Good quality construction/materials. I was surprised at how fast the item arrived at my house, (at least 4 days before I expected it)The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the large ottoman is a little uncomfortable on the edges when you prop your feet up!"
3,Over-Powering Chemical Smell,"I finally got 2 sets of these ottomans. The first thing I noticed was a very heavy chemical smell. It smelled like car wax. I actually had to leave these out on our deck for 2 days to ""air"" out. I also buffed the ottomans with cotton rags even though there is no visible residue. The chemical smell is not over-powering like before, but it still smells like car wax. I will put them in the garage for a couple of days.Otherwise, they look great and are somewhat of a deal at $60. I love the fact that there is storage space inside the larger one. The vinyl is so-so quality. If you leave anything, i.e. cup, on the surface, there is an impression into the vinyl that takes several hours to disappear."
1,Rancid ottomans,"Despite reading other reviews on how aweful these ottomans smelled, I opted to purchase them anyway since they were at such a reasonable price. I really thought I could air them out (they smell like gasoline), but it has yet to happen. I started by airing the ottomans out in my spare bedroom, but the smell began to take over my entire apartment, so I now have them sitting outside on my balcony. I received the ottomans on December 27th, it's now January 20th and the smell still remains. Do no waste your money on these ottomans unless you have a poor sense of smell."
2,Functional but Smelly,"I really liked the size and these were perfect for the area of use. However, we cannot get rid of the horrible chemical smell. Left them out in our garage for a week prior to bringing inside the house. Still smells horrible. May have to return since we are worried for our health."
2,bad smell,"I wish I had read the reviews from others about the bad smell of this product before ordering it. I opened it before the holidays, assumed the smell was a temporary one from packing. Went out of town for a week and came back to find the smell as strong as before. Even with a room deodorant sitting right on it, I still smell it.Except for the smell this is a great product and just what I was looking for at a wonderful price. I live in a small Manhattan apartment and have no place to set this outdoors to ""air out"".Recently customer service at Amazon was finally able to get me a phone number for the manufacturer - I hope to be able to call them next week."
2,smell bad but looks fine,As above the item came and smells a lot like shoe polish or dye. Took quite a while for the smell to dissapate like two weeks and I had to leave them outside to air out. They still smell some. Give where this product was made and the recent recalls on products I was concerned about the toxicity of the smell. Just be aware.
1,Over-Powering Chemical Smell,I must agree with the other amazon reviewer. I can't believe I bought this almost 2 years ago and this still has an Over-Powering Chemical Smell kind of like formaldahyde.. ugh. WIll the smell ever fade?
4,ottoman,"I would recommend this product. Wierd smell lasts for a few days, but you can live with it. Love the storage."
3,"Ottoman ,got to have them","The product had previously been on sale. I should have purchased them at that time with a better price. Satisfactory, but a bit overpriced for the quality received."
1,Didn't even get it.,"I think I would've loved this product, but Amazon botched my order and sent it to the wrong address. I got reimbursed for it, but I didn't want my money back. I wanted the ottoman. I doubt I'll buy from amazon again after this."
3,great deal,"Great deal for the Ottoman set. There is a pretty strong smell for the first couple of weeks, but it eventually goes away (or not as strong). The larger one is good for storage and the smaller ottoman is pretty comfortable to sit on."
5,Love it!,"Love it! The little one seems smaller than I was expecting, but it's fine. I really enjoy that it flips around to become a table...so nice!"
1,it smells so bad!!!,"i baught this just recently and now i deeply regret it. It's was a present for my mom and dad but their reaction,,,, what's that smell? Smells like gasoline!?! My mom felt dizzy so we had to take it out to the garage. We tried a lot of deodorizers and odor aways but the smell is still there? If you don't want to get hypoxia or any lung dse in the future,,,don't buy this ottoman!"
1,Oh the SMELL!!!!,I don't know what to do with these ottomans because they still stink so bad. They are still in the garage. But they look nice and they are functional. What did others do about the smell?
2,Needs improvements,"I don't like these ottoman so much. The big one, cushions is not thick enough over the rim of the base. Hurts the legs while sitting on it. The little one, will not support anyone over 200lbs. It wobble when I sit on it, I weigh about 190lbs. Neat idea, just need to work out some details to make them better."
2,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. I purchased this item at a great price on Amazon. I read some other people's reviews and saw that some experienced strong chemical smell, and others didn't. I decided to chance it.The item arrived and much to my disappointment it did have a strong chemical smell. Also the inside tray under the lid is made out of some sort of cardboard, so don't even think about putting a cold glass on it without a good coaster or it will swell up. Also the tray on the underside of mine looked like it was scratched and somebody colored it in with a black ink pen to conceal the damage. Needless to say it went back. Amazon's return policy is awesome! Its too bad the items didn't work out for me."
4,Love these!,"What a great deal! I got these for $40.00. They are the perfect size for what I needed (just something to put my feet up on after a long day at work!The only big negative is that they smell. My husband doesn't notice the odor, but I do. It has faded over time, but it is still there. For $40.00 this deal can't be beat. I see them all the time at Bed Bath & Beyond for $79.99!"
1,They both broke!,"Both of these broke. The big ottoman cracks more and more every time someone sits on it. The little one completely collapsed. I want my money back. Now, they are both useless."
1,That atrocious smell,"I've had this set for over 4 months now and the smell has not subsided at all. I was using the big ottoman to store an extra bed sheet set, but it transferred its smell onto the sheets too. The smell is bad enough to make the set rather worthless to me."
4,"well-built, well-designed",These ottomans are well-designed and well-built. And inexpensive. I'm happy that I purchased mine.
4,Great for the price,You will not beat thsi value. I purchased two for my theater room and I am contemplating purchasing two more. They look great but I wish the construciton was a littler better. They work great and function but they are not hefty to take a big beating.
4,Great for the price,"For the price of this product I came out ahead. They are very functional, look great to put in any corner for storage or extra seating, or as an actual foot rest. The cover on the underside is very thin and can easily be pushed through the stapling that holds it, but that is my only problem with it. I did in fact buy two as I couldn't beat the price any where, and they work great as a tasteful toy chest I can keep in my living room."
4,Pleased & Relieved,"The ottomans arrived quickly and were packaged well. I was concerned about the smell that many people had mentioned in their reviews, but luckily it was mild and will air out on a day or two. Although a little smaller than I envisioned, these will work out well for extra seating & storage in my apartment. For $40 I am happy with this purchase."
4,Great Value! Buy them,"Yes, they did have a smell to them! But once it clears up you can enjoy the ottoman set! High functional! Buy them you will love them. I order 3 sets and they are perfect for my living room."
5,Great Set!,"Ottomans can be so expensive - I'd bought my husband a wicker one a number of years ago, because that is all that I could find at the time under $100.00 locally.These are VERY nice. The set just arrived, the smell isn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. I wouldn't have even thought about it if I'd not read the reviews. They are sturdy, and $40 with shipping is a bargain for the quality. What a great Christmas gift to replace the current one!"
4,Very good if you like Ikea-quality,"My wife and I are happy with lower-end but stylish products like Ikea, and so these ottomans are perfect. A great bargain!*UPDATED 11/8/12* We still love these ottomans! The larger one is very sturdy and holds all our knick knacks well; it even functioned as our coffee table for a little while with the tray part facing up. The smaller one is perfect for propping your feet up."
4,Nice,"Came quickly and better quality than I expected. The edges doesn't fit perfectly, but just a minor detail. Good buy for the price $40."
1,stinky situation,This is a very nice looking and well designed product. There is one very large problem however. I have this product for almost a month and it smells horribly of what I would describe as a terpentine smell. It actually tears up your eyes and smells up the room. It was so bad I tried keeping it outside whenever weather permitted. Then I kept it in my front hall. I have tried cleaning it many times and using air freshening sprays. Nothing seems to work. Whatever type of stain or dye that was used to manufacture this product. It really is a shame. I like the ottomons very much. Right now it is in my basement so it doesn't smell up the house. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.
3,"Good Idea, But...","I got this as a gold box deal before Christmas, and thought I hit the jackpot. Something for myself at a good price. First of all, the chemical smell was noticable before I even opened the box. I got it out and noticed that one of the handles was barely hanging on. The leather was okay quality, but kind of thin. I think with frequent use it would wear down easily.I let it air out in my garage for a week, but it was still so strong I got a migraine from then being in my living room for an hour. I can't imagine what is going on with that leather to make it smell like that. I would think it isn't good for the body. I finally couldn't stand it anymore, and just sent it back. I did give it three stars b/c I think it is a cost effective option if you can get over the smell and don't think it will last more than a few years."
5,Quality product for a great price tag,I bought 2 and absolutely love them. They look great and look better than more expensive ottomans I've researched (and I'm very picky). I separated the inner ottomans as a set so there are 2 matching sets for each of my couches. This made for nice conversation areas since people used them as seats at a party I recently had.
3,Simple - but functional,"These aren't amazing pieces of furniture, nor would you expect them to be for this price. But they seem well built and will serve their purpose in my living room.They definitely smell funny when you pull them out of the box, but that goes away.For the price (I got them for around 50 dollars or so if I recall) - you can't go wrong."
5,Convinent item for small spaces,"1) Good for small or large space.2) Tray is really convenient and comfortable3) The pair is really of great value - I was able to use the child ottoman comfortably to work on my laptop.4) The color is not stark brown as might appear in the photograph, but its a light brown; if seen in a dim light one might see them as stark black color - it happened to me when I unpacked it in a little day light in my room.5) Both are easy to move around6) Tray has a strap to pull out the tray - very convenient and thoughtful design.7) The large ottoman can be used for storage purposes though it won't hold a large item but will be very useful to store the newspapers etc.8) If one pay attention then one can observe that the hight of both the ottoman is so perfect to make a foot rest or for additional seating.9) Well, a great value for the price and the price was also great.--AKK"
5,Best bang for the buck!,"I'd looked high and low for a decent 2 piece ottoman set for my computer/gaming room. I had actually seen this very same set at a few retail stores for nearly double the costs.After testing it, trying it out, moving it about, and putting some fair weight on it I can say that it's pretty damned high quality craftsmenship.This little handy duo is going to work great for me. The smaller for my feet, the larger for storage and a side table. Great deal."
4,nice product for the price,"an excellent buy at the price. I've seen some ottomans of a similar style for more than twice the price and I can see why that is - the build quality is better in the higher priced units. But seriously, these ottomans are damn good value and look the part - I'll take 80% of the quality for less than 50% of the price. Mine were delivered quickly, and didn't have any funny smell."
3,You get what you paid for.,"Got the product promptly. Looks great from the outside. Looks like it's sewn right.But frame was so light. It feels just like a cardboard. The inner liner looks so cheap and the one I got, one side was loose. Looks like they forgot to hammer it down. And yes, there's this strong smell but hopefully it will just fade in time. In summary, it looks good but I don't think it will last few weeks."
4,A great deal!,I was very satisfied with this buy! The material is good quality and seems durable if not mishandled. I was prepared for a smell but there was none. It was a perfect choice for the extra seating & storage I was looking for.
3,needed a little repair,"On arrival, one of the inner boards was found to be loose and I had to push it back in- no worries. It works. The flip tray is handy for when you need a small table for drinks. The smaller ottoman is small- really only functional for petite people or kids."
4,Brown ottoman Set,"This is quite a nice set. I purchased it as a gift and would buy one for myself. My mother loves the smaller foot stool and thinks the size is perfect. It's very nice looking - more than I expected. The only minor flaw was that the top of the foot stool was not sewn together straight, but it's only cosmetic. Both seem sturdy enough and I really like that the top of the larger ottoman can be used as a tray/table. Many of the reviews I read before purchase mentioned an odor, but that was not the case with the set I ordered. Over all I found this to be an excellent value for the price."
2,Disappointed!,"These seemed like a great deal but they are too poorly made to be worth it. My furniture-challenged boyfriend (and even his kids!) were really excited when I gave these to him. They are good looking and (seemingly) useful. HOWEVER, within two weeks part of the inner support of both pieces had broken and collapsed inward. They will be returned."
5,My wife likes it,"She was looking at a discounted one at BedBathAndBeyond that was $25+Tax after the discount. She says that this one is bigger and better looking. Also, we checked that there is no smell coming from any of the peices (checked all 4 peices), as stated in some comments. So overall happy with this purchase for now. I may update this thread in a few days if there is some surprise."
4,Wrong Color Sent,This was a good price and I like the ottoman but I ordered Brown not Black like I received.I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it so I just kept it.
5,Smell But worth it.,As with what other reviwers are saying there is a smell. Some people have a sensitive nose. I have to admit this product does smell very bad. The chemical smell is horrible. I will get over it. You will have to air this product out. The set is worth the wait. I find the smaller footrest to be very cute. Everything is super comfortable. This item before it sold out was selling for 39.99 I have purchased two sets for 49.99. If you write amazon a letter within 30 days of purchased they refund you the money like they did for me. I am guessing they sold for a much lower price because of the complaints because of the smell. I live in a NY studio apartment so this item works perfect with the amount of space. They are very stylish and worth the price. If you do purchase I recommend buying both because it does make for a great long coffee table.
3,Not the quality I was looking for,"I purchased this item to give as a Christmas gift. The first one arrived damaged from shipping. They had not packed it in anything protective, just a cardboard box that was torn through.I returned it and got a second one, that arrived with a nail sticking through the side and a hole in the leather. Very disappointing for something I was giving as a gift! I'd recommend buying in a store where you can see them before leaving with them!"
3,"Functional, questionable construction","These are a great addition to any home. In fact they look great in mine. However, the lid on the larger cube cracked when I was moving them. Thing is I didn't even apply too much pressure to it. On a side note, it was easy to fix and overall I am satified with the product. It's a great way to keep ""messes"" out of site."
5,Great purchase!,This is a great buy. I bought one set and love it so much I got another one. I use the smaller one as a foot stool and the big one mostly as a food tray but when I have a lot of people coming over to my place they are very handy to have around.
4,Smell goes away...,"This product is high quality for a good price. It does smell when you first unwrap them, but after two weeks in the garage it goes away. They look great in our condo!"
2,"Nice item, HORRIBLE chemical smell","The item itself is nice. The design is tight and the material is seemingly well stitched. The storage space within is ample. This would be a four-star review...BUT... whatever chemical they used to treat or cure this fake leather smells absolutely horrible. After one afternoon of having two of these in my living room, my wife started to get a headache, and we were both concerned about letting our daughter sit on them.I eventually put both of them into my garage to air out. They've been in there about 30 days, and the smell has lessened, but it's still not gone. I have no idea what I'm going to do with these... perhaps by spring they might be usable again."
2,STINKY!!!!,These are so nice looking and functional...however the smell is discusting and i cant take it anymore...these are going back.
1,Pay attention to the bad reviews....,"because I didn't and regretted it. I was hoping that everyone who commented on the smell was exaggerating a bit. They weren't. I left it outside in the direct sun all day and the smell was just as strong. But then I started thinking I shouldn't have to leave furniture outside first in order to bring it into the house. Also, the greasy feel that other people complained about held true. I was afraid to rest my feet on it not knowing what chemicals were used...and I certainly wasn't going to have my 7 month old nephew playing around it. Like I said, pay attention to the bad reviews."
3,ordered anyway,"After reading the other reviews regarding the strong chemical odor, I took a chance and ordered this ottoman anyway. Well, mine did have the odor, however I didnt find it necessary to put in another room or the garage. The odor is definately there when you remove the top, so I wouldnt consider storing anything inside. Other than that, I think it was a good buy."
3,"Look good, smell bad","We got a good deal on these things and like the way they look. However, we've had to air them out for a few weeks and wash them to try and get rid of the smell. They do not smell like leather. They smell like chemicals. The first night we put them out by our couch, my wife got a headache. They should lose the smell eventually, which will be great."
4,Nice looking. Bad smelling,"I am in agreement with all the comments regarding the odor that comes with these ottomans. IT STINKS! Some sort of heavy chemical type odor, that seems to be associated with the material they are made of. I have been ""airing"" them out for several days and it is not helping much. Other than that seem to be of good quality and mine arrived very quickly."
2,Poor fit,"The Metra dash kit does not line up well, it pushes the top right corner of the Honda Ridgeline dash out so that it no longer stays in place. I will be replacing the Metra kit with a Scosche kit, look for my review of the Scosche."
5,"First time weird, second time treasured!","Having grown up in the 50s, I remembered the name Yma Sumac when I was perusing the 'not-for-public-consumption' (not at the front of the store) CDs in a music store. Curious, I purchased the ""Mambo"" CD. After first hearing it, I said to myself 'This is weird.' After a second and third hearing, I realized I was hooked. The exotic stretches of her vocal range were something I learned to love, like a second Martini. Who else can reach the highest of soprano heights and the lowest of gutteral grunts and get away with it so gracefully as the supreme Yma???"
1,Disappointing,"I did not get a real sense about what Greece is like from reading this book. I thought this author had a very pessimistic/negative bent as well. He focused a lot on the ancient past and not much on the present. Never having been to Greece, I can't say whether this book is accurate or inaccurate but I would think the job of a guidebook is to make the reader excited about going somewhere and this book did not accomplish that."
2,Not as good as other Culture Shock books,"It does have some good information if you plan to move there, but if you are reading it for entertainment, don't bother. The author focuses on nitty gritty of the law in Greece and lawsuits and real estate transactions, might be useful but is very boring."
1,Impressing,It is impressing that the author manages to write 283 pages without giving any relevant information.
2,BLACK YAWN,"Remember when Steven Seagal was a hot property and his action films were decent? Well don't expect that in this wearisome retread. Seagal plays Jonathan Cold (thank God they didn't call him Jonathan Hott!), an agent for some deep dark secret covert organization with ""four columns""? Tamara Davies is the requisite hottie agent who wonders what Seagal's up to and carries on like most female agents in these Romanian movies--makes one dumb move after another. The storyline (ho hum) centers on terrorists out to set off a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles. Seagal is hardly seen during any of his few hand to hand combats, pretty much confirming that the beefy actor's stuntman did all the work, of which there is very little. A preposterous chase scene in a garbage truck is reminiscent of Roadrunner cartoons in its lunacy. Two stars for the hammy but effective performance from John Pyper Ferguson as the villain. At least he looks like he's having fun."
4,Black Dawn,"One of the better new Segal movies I have seen,I even bought this one. I agree however with all the other reviews, Lots of guns and bullets in this one but ""Where is the martial arts, we all love lord Steven for?"" I cast my vote for his best ever to ""Under Seige"" where our hero plays Casey Ryback, next to Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones."
3,"Itls a seagal movie, enough said.","My wife LOVES Seagal so this was added to her collection. Not his best by a long shot, but it is a Seagal movie."
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,SEAGAL WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GUY!!! THIS ONE IS ONE YOU GET FROM WALL MART BIN!!! IT IS WORTH A WATCH AND THATS ALL!!
2,More like a Black Eye,"To your wallet well in this case my wallet. Here i go thinking that this one would be any different from Seagal's recent ""efforts"". Not even close i cant believe i even lasted as long as i did. Not really anything nice to say about this the acting was marginal at best, fighting scenes were just blah and to be honest. He is a bit old and a tad bit more out of shape weight wise. Sorry i'm a fan but even i know when to throw in the towel...DING...throw it in please."
2,"Beer gut and choppy lines, Steve is depressing me slowly...","Welcome to another movie documenting the slow decline of my hero. Watching Steve fall apart from movie to movie is making my own aging easier. I mean if the Steve can age and get fat, I feel better about me getting fat and old. In this movie, his ""not even close"" stuntman works hard although there are no real martial arts anyway. It's a ""run and gun"" and Steve left his running shoes in other movies. I think I enjoy paying for his retirement by buying these ""straight to DVD"" release wonders. I am going to his website to buy some almond oil in a few minutes."
1,Black Dawn for Seagal,"Of course only fans would get this movie.Steven looks fat, old, and tired -- even to fans who were hoping for a little escapism.Whats with the accent?"
2,another awful film in Seagal's Direct-to-DVD Era,"Black Dawn is one of the very bad films in Seagal's direct-to-DVD era. It's a sequel to the equally horrible The Foreigner (also a 2-Star Film). As with other bad Seagal films the storyline is very difficult to follow. Making the film even more difficult to follow is the terrible sound quality. I gave up watching Black Dawn 40 minutes into the film. Unless you're a big Seagal fan, I would recommend skipping this film and going for some of his earlier works or even some of the more recent DTV works which are of much better quality. If you've really got to watch this one, rent it or buy it used on Amazon."
2,The Foreigner isn't great but still better than Black Dawn,"It's a watch-able Seagal outing but ultimately very forgettable and verges on being boring. Today You Die even with all its problems and stock footage ripped from other movies has the edge on Black Dawn. The much talked about chase scene is boring, cheap looking and makes use of very obvious green screen effects when Seagal is on the top of the Dump Truck. Seagal looks bored, the script has nothing to give Seagal a chance to deliver lines the fans want to hear, he has no fight scenes and for some reason the producers decided to insert a stunt double that looked absolutely nothing like Seagal in any way near the end for no reason I could see and made me cringe when I saw it. The stunt double is not even wearing the same coloured suit as Seagal. For Seagal fans it's worth a rental then forget about it and move on to Mercenary For Justice which sounds very promising. For non Seagal fans, it's probably not worth even renting."
4,about the film/movie black dawn..........,This DVD film/movie has been sold in Singapore and I grabbed one copy and watched....hee hee and the story is basically about the stoppage of sale of the nuclear bomb which ended up been activated by timer where Seagal and his woman colleagues managed top get rid of the bomb by throwing into sea from helicopter and the explosion went off after several minutes and the whole story ended.

4,what's this about Christian music being no good?,"In Select circles of the secular community there are people who consider themselves authorties on Christian mucic. Most of it they say is [...]. Vector is however, not one of those bands. This collection of musicians, which harbors on of the world's greatest and most creative guitarists, Jimmy Abegg, is on of the most underrated bands in the entire music world. Sad thing is that they very infrequently record. Because of that, in my opinion, you should snag this bad boy up and give it a spin on the victrola. Happy Tunes--spamthewunderdaug"
2,"Struggles, triumphs, and somebody talk to the kids, please","Disclaimer: This review is based on a quick skim of the book in a friend's house, and therefore may possibly miss something important...Somehow, a book has been put together on Feminist Parenting, and apparently all the contributors are female.This must be an oversight. Feminist parenting must, will, and does have an impact on male children (indeed, this is discussed by some of those who do write). Where are their views? Not, it would appear, here.What a missed opportunity."
3,The Dishonest Murderer,"When the poisoned Bowery bum turned out to be a missing Senator, Lt. Weigand was glad that Mr. and Mrs. North were not involved. Then he found that they knew the murdered man -- and were just wacky enough to put their own heads into a noose trying to untangle this bizarre, baffling case."
5,My favorite from the King of the Blues!,"Just saw BB in concert last night. At 74 he's still looking and sounding great. Played lots of tunes from this CD. I like Blues On The Bayou because it doesn't have all those cameo appearance guest shots from other artists... just BB and his band. Jimmie Vaughan unfortunately was a big disappointment in the concert, fwiw. BB: You're the Boss!"
4,Simplemente genial,"Excelente disco, realmente estaba buscando algo de blues puro, tal cual lo interpreta el gran B.B. King. Sin embargo, creo que el disco está un poco estancado en el estilo. Creo que pudo haber sido genial introducir algunas canciones que rompieran con el ritmo en general. Ampliamente recomendable!!!"
4,good disc,after the lameness of deuces wild this is a step up.this disc is good&solid.B.B&the Band get down to business on this disc.this is his best disc in a long time.he puts his heart&soul on this disc.and most of it works.
5,This is the quintessential BB King,"This album has all of the good things that make BB King a pleasure to listen to. Clean, crisp, and distinctive notes that set him apart from all others. His lyrics and clarity are classic. This album is a definite MUST !!"
1,YUCK!,"I use silicone adhesive for many things, and always try to keep it on hand. This was unequivocally the worst I have *EVER* used in my entire life ... all dried up and impossible to extract from the tube. I finally had to cut the bottle apart with scissors and use a dowel to retrieve what little was useable. I will NEVER buy this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Awesome CD,"There's nothing like a good old school miami bass CD. This cd will get your system thumpin, with bass so low only a true enthusiast would appreciate it. The title track is obviously a famous recording, but other titles like ""My girl's got that booty"", are hidden treasures. Not to mention a bass collector's dream. I wouldn't recommend this CD to your parents, but if you love bass...."
3,Didn't care as much for the blueberry,"Loved the strawberry, not so much the blueberry. But that's pretty heavily biased on personal taste. Your mileage may vary."
3,Not Vegan,"Just wanted to point out that these are not vegan since they contain honey. If you searched on vegan toaster pastries these probably came up anyway. It is hard often hard to find the honey, gelatin, or whey (milk) they often stick way down in the label on these highly processed products."
5,All the Jams together,"finally all the Jams on these Sets.I had to Buy the First&then 2nd Sets of Cameo's Best between 93&95.but finally all the Jams together.""Be Yourself"",Word Up"",and so many Jams that will keep you Grooving.I give Cameo Props for Hanging in there when the Mid to Late 80's in the Industry was running the Funk away.Cameo stayed in there&kept the Jams Coming.from there Horns to there Grooves you can't lose."
5,PRICELESS,"There's not much I can add to what everyone has said about this DVD. I would have paid triple the price just for the interviews with Brian alone. The audiences' reaction to the live show afterwards, and then Darian's commentary where he's nearly in tears...but the most astonishing footage of all are the vocal rehearsals at Brian's house. Rarely does the general audience get to witness something like this. For the Brian Wilson fan, this truly is as good as it gets."
3,MONOGRAM SET!!!!!,"3 typical films from Monogram Pictures. They look ok, but would be more fun to watch if they didn't have all the splices. Someone needs to take just a little interest in old films like these, and using multiple prints could easily put together one good print of many of these older films."
3,Decent,"Decent practice book. There are definitely better out there, but it serves its purpose. Better explanations for answers would be helpful"
3,Pulp sci-fi,"I read this book back in junior high school. Space colonists residing on the Moon, Mars and hollowed out asteroids rebel against the centralized government of earth. No deep thinking or theorizing along the lines of Heinlein or Asimov, but an enjoyable read."
2,"Predictable, not much fun","I picked this book up from the library and read it over the holidays since I didn't have anything else to do. While I do enjoy some science fiction, this one was remarkably boring. The authors simply don't have the talent necessary to create real suspense. In addition, this book doesn't feature any of the scientific creativity that marks any good SF works.The Island Worlds is set a few hundred years in the future, when some humans have established colonies in the asteroid belt. The Earth, meanwhile, is controlled by one government, and a group of bureaucrats is trying to shut down the space exploration industry, leading to a war between the ""good guys"" in space and the ""bad guys"" from Earth. The ending of the book is entirely predictable, and there aren't any major plot events that you can't see coming well in advance. Overall, this book just doesn't stand out from the thousands of other SF titles out there."
5,million dollar welder,"I've known Paul almost all my life.Sometimes on a hot, muggy Belzoni day, i'll head down to see him. Around here, everyone just sees another guy doin' an honest day's work, which he does, but, outside of this little town, Paul Jones is a huge hit.people all over the world see him every day.this average-looking welder is an extraordinary,million dollar musician."
5,Good Stuff,"I actually prefer the taste over ""normal"" pasta. What else can you ask for - healthier and tastier. Now I don't feel as guilty smothering it with Alfredo sauce..."
5,Excellent Pasta!,"This stuff is great! Healthier and tastier than any other pasta that I've tried, (except for my mother in laws homemade)."
4,a good book,"It is a good book, but not great as his another one: Rock and Royalty, Versace/Avedon. If you are a fan of Versace, then it's worth to buy one."
1,Tastes too salty,"This oatmeal is too salty and my husband cannot eat it. I have even tried to mix it with other oatmeal and he still cannot eat it. I am very disappointed in this product since I have ordered it numerous times and the last two times I have ordered it, it has been too salty. My husband used to enjoy this oatmeal but not now. He has oatmeal every day and this will not be his brand of choice any more!"
4,Misleading,"First, I found the book to be valuable and it lists books that boys would benefit from by reading.But the title ""Great Books for Boys"" is misleading. Even the introduction, which states that the criteria for selecting books was the books cover ""topics that particularly appeal to boys"" or they ""capture the complexity of boys' lives,"" is misleadingI was expecting a book analogous to the author's ""Great Books for Girls"" which included a good number of books where the main character was a female role model. Unfortunately the present book includes relatively few books where the main character was a male role model.Instead it lists books that would be appropriate for teaching both boys and girls about diversity. (There is also a heavy dose of books covering boys' feeling.) A more accurate title would be ""Great Books for Boys and Girls to Learn about Diversity in our World."""
4,Good resource,"I have a 2 year old son and want to get him on the road to reading as quickly as possible...with the result of loving it. Studies show that by the age of 8, if boys are not shown how important reading is, they will just simply quit doing it, unless they have to. THis book will help you get good books in their hands and get them loving reading."
4,I guess pretty good,"This is pretty well made. You can get the feed bins out to clean them which is really nice. When I had a similar one in Arkansas, I had song birds lining up to feed. Here in WV, I get a few sparrows and they are pretty skittish about using it. I don't think it's a product problem."
3,Great idea but only good for some places,"I got this for my parents who enjoy watching the birds. First we had to take the screen off the window they wanted to use. Then we realized that because the tubs are small refilling it would be awkward where we had put it, so we put it by the front door. Since the birds drop all the shells out it made a big mess by the front door which my mother got tired of cleaning up. Larger birds also managed to knock the trays out and spill all the food. It would be good for an area where a mess doesn't matter and that is easy for you to refill. It's just ok."

1,Wish I could say it was better.,"Unfortunately, neither the one I received the first time, nor the one I received as a return, was 10 feet in length. While the package is labeled at 10FT and amazon lists this as a ""10 ft. power cable"", this cable is only 6 feet long. This is absolutely StarTech's fault, not Amazons. StarTech apparently mislabeled, multiple cables. However, amazon needs to remove this product from their site. Thanks amazon and community."
2,not to happy,"very stubby neck, not long like pictured. and that's what I was looking for was a long neck, flexible. I opened the box and its the handled funnel with about a one inch neck, why do you show a long neck and send a short stub????"
5,Perfect,"Funnel is exactly what was needed to fill our pontoon boat at the dock. We tried every type of fuel can, but usually ended up with a few drops of fuel in the lake. This funnel worked like a charm..no more fuel in the lake."
4,Yes I am a beginner...........,"I left out a star, ONLY because I am a new Radiohead fan and I'm still attempting to ""get there"". All I have to say is ""anyone can play guitar"". That's what this album is to me. This album may not ""hold a candle"" to the Bends but how can you beat the catchy, yet non-mainstreamness of ""anyone can play guitar""? You simply can't. I have SO much radiohead to catch up on, only owning their first two albums, I am terribly slacking on my Radiohead but I will get there. Too bad this isn't sold on vinyl.....neither is The Bends for that matter...... Ah well. I still have the knowledge that this is an incredible band with the egos to match but good music is good music and that's what you get with this album. Catchy, yes, but where were they expected to begin??"
3,emerging brilliance evident on pablo honey,"though not polished, at this stage in their careers pablo honey shows evidence of the brilliance to come from this UK band. The range they display on songs from ""anyone can play guitar"" to ""thinking about you"" is gargantuan. If you love this band, you'll have to finish off your collection by owning this, their first U.S. release, if only from curiosity."
4,Hope Through Desperation,"This is one of the best albums of the '90s. Although some songs are emotionally painful (""Creep,"" especially), and most deal with topics like loneliness and ostracism, the album is laced with hope.Both ""Stop Whispering"" and ""Prove Yourself"" insist that we are are worthy, even in the face of self-doubt or self-loathing. One reviewer here says ""Prove Yourself"" encourages suicide; it does not. Instead, the line ""Prove Yourself"" is an exhortation to take control of your life, to make your life worth living.Optimism in the face of despair. It's an adept album, both musically and lyrically.Of course, my S.O. tells me I listen to depressing music..."
3,the sound of things to come,"This is Radiohead in their raw unrefined state, but you could get the sense of bigger things to come that Radiohead was going to be more than just another band coming out with the grunge sound during the time bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam were at the height of their popularity. Not a great album, but worth listening to."
2,Better things were to come for Radiohead,"Radiohead's first release in 1993, Pablo Honey is a decent CD. The first half of it is pretty good, with songs like ""You"", ""Creep"", and ""How Do You"". But overall, it isn't really that good. OK Computer and The Bends are both five stars and two of my favorite albums, but Pablo Honey isn't really worth checking out unless you're a hardcore fan."
2,A solid first effort,"Pablo Honey displays Radiohead before the fame and experimentation that ensued. Some songs, such as ""Stop Whispering"" and ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"", are qute listenable, as is ""Creep"", but most of the rest is forgettable. This CD is a neccesary addition to your collection only if you are a Radiohead fan. Otherwise, there is little to enjoy on this disc."
2,They got better,"Agree with the guy who said a lot of people listened to this after hearing OK Computer. That said - this album isn't much good. But it if you really, really, really like ""Creep"" - otherwise, it's just really depressing guitar fuzz. Couple of other good tracks - ""Lurgee,"" but otherwise... These guys got a lot better."
4,hard to believe...,"... that this is the same band who wrote OK Computer. This album is in the shodow of OK Computer and I have a feeling that Kid A will turn that shadow into total darkness for Pablo Honey. Which is a shame. Any day Radiohead would like to just throw out a CD of songs instead of musical landscapes would be fine with me. ""Vegetable"", ""Think About You"", ""Stop Whispering"" and the big hit ""Creep"" are enjoyable today as they were back in 1993. If you are a Radiohead diehard you probably own this CD and it has about 4 inches of dust on it because it's all about Ok Computer. If you want a good CD with the more traditional verse, chorus, verse this is good for you and you will enjoy it. This CD beats anything done by Blur or Oasis. So you could imagine if that's the case with Pablo Honey, OK Computer is very close to scripture."
4,I want to be in a band when i get to heaven,"What a change RH has made since the release of this album. Im sure you have all heard Creep, which is enough of a reason in its self to buy this cd, but there is definately so much more to this album. The album starts with You, which is one of the most beautiful songs the band has ever written. Stop Whispering(a tribute to the Pixes), Anyone Can Play Guitar, Thinking of You, Blow Out, and I Can't make this one of the best cd's from this era and one of the best in my collection. From begining to end it is a masterpiece. It really desevers 4.5 stars. Buy it and remenice with me on the overly guitar driven RH of the early 90's. Thom sounds like such a man on this album."
4,The roots of one of the best bands today,"Radiohead, undoubtedly one of todays most popular bands today, made a huge impression with their first album. As OK Computer was my first radiohead album, I found it interesting to see how the bands music has changed over 3 albums and 5 or so years. Best song the album is definitely ""Creep"" which seems different qualities not present in the other songs. The music is quite traditional rock (guitar, bass and drums) with little mixing but crative guitar playing is present for example the fast ""hits"" on the 2nd guitar before the chorus of ""Creep"". Other good songs include ""Anyone can play guitar"" with its carefree lyrics and ""Thinking about you"".For a first Radiohead album I wouldn't recommend this album, try The Bends, or OK Computer, but for a dedicated radiohead fan interested in the roots of this great band definitely."
2,Very VERY humble beginnings,"Another title to this review could've been 'Whoa! Whoa... Really not good. -at all'.Let me first state that Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. I would give The Bends and OK Computer both five stars and the rest after them between three and four stars but this album is not really the Radiohead that I, and most everybody else, have come to know and love.Another reviewer said it best in his title to his review, ""Doesn't really foreshadow the future greatness of the band"". And yet another reviewer said that ""this could be anybody"". I couldn't agree more with both of those reviewer's statements. Aside from track two (Creep) this album is nothing special and in my opinion is only worth having to complete a Radiohead collection."
3,"not radiohead's best, but a few good tracks","this album has more of a generic pop feel to it than other radiohead albums. considering how amazing radiohead is nowadays, you would have expected a more powerful debut than this. yes, there are some good tracks on here (creep, you, thinking about you) but it pales in comparison to radiohead's later work. even the bends, which was released only 2 years after this album, puts this album to shame. i don't think this album is bad, i mean it's better than most (if not all) of the garbage on mtv nowadays.if you are new to radiohead i recommend starting with the bends and moving forwards from there, and come back to this one later. if you were to buy only one radiohead album, i would go with kid a or ok computer.7.0/10"
2,Birth of Radiohead,"This release is a must for a Radiohead admirer but only to complete a collection. The growth of Thom Yorke & company is amazing!In this writer's opinion, Pablo Honey is nothing ""special"". There is no new ground broken except Radiohead's debut & it is difficult to see the quality of their future work. Yes the performance is fine but the material offers nothing unique. If I had bought this CD first, I probably would not have purchased another. However, with the breathtaking abilities displayed by each of the subsequent releases beginning with ""The Bends"", Radiohead has now achieved greatness! So, go ahead, complete your collection!"
1,DIABOLICAL RUBBISH,"An album that is almost indescribably horrible. I couldn't believe how bad this was after hearing their RH's other albums. The difference between Pablo Honey and Amnesiac is the difference between night and day. I mean, this album is really, quite bad. It's tuneless, uninspired tripe; possibly the worst debut album in history from a band that would later become great. Don't buy it."
1,rip-off band!,"I liked the song ""Creep"" better when it was called ""The air that I breathe"" by the Hollies. No wonder they hate it and won't play it live-- the song that made them so popular is not theirs.Don't believe me? Then how do you explain the fact that Albert Hammond and Mike Hazelwood's names are in the publishing credits along with those of the five band members? Were they feeling generous?The songs have an almost identical bass line and the verses have the same chord structure and a similiar melody.Learn a thing or two about music theory.This band [is not good]"
1,Garbagehead,"I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about. What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing. I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever. The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable. Garbage folks that is all this amounts to. The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before. You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it. Don't believe the hype!"
4,A very solid debut album!,"Radiohead's first album is a worthy debut for this great band. You can hear the beginnings of this band's great talent, later to be refined, oozing through every song. ""Creep"" became an enormous hit for good reason. It is a wonderful, emotional piece of music that remains one of Radiohead's best. It is too bad the band has come to dislike it. A great song is a great song. But not letting ""Creep"" steal the whole show, ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" is the second great powerhouse song on this album. The rest is good, but not good enough to push the rating up to 5 stars. As a whole, Pablo Honey certainly couldn't be considered Radiohead's best, but it is a fine album nonetheless."
2,Doesn't even show promise,"I decided to listen to this CD again after going completely gaga over The Bends, OK Computer, Airbag, and My Iron Lung. And you know, it is really pretty bad. There is only one song on the disc that reveals anything about the destiny the band was headed for (""Stop whispering""). And of course you know ""Creep"", but all the rest of the songs are unlistenable to me. Skip it. I assume you've already bought OK Computer--so BUY THE BENDS!!! And if you already have that too, buy the Australian My Iron Lung EP!"
2,Jesus Christ...,"Comparing this s**t to any of Radiohead later albums is a physical impossiblity, and it's crazy to think that they were made by the same people. While it's not the worst album ever or anything, Pablo Honey is pretty damn bad in just about every aspect. The production is terrible, the lyrics are nothing special, the guitar (except on ""Creep"") sounds exactly like every other watered-down, mainstream band's guitar, and even Thom Yorke's voice sounds very different, and a billion times worse. ""Creep"" is the only song on the entire album that I would settle to say is good, but its not great. My advice to you, whether you love Radiohead, hate them, think they're okay, or have never heard them before is to buy anyone of their albums other than this. If you're really that curious to find out what this junk sounds like, download it, don't buy it."
4,"Good, but not great","This album is quite good; ""Creep"" grows on you, ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" is memorable, while the best song is ""Blow Out,"" the nonsensical but brilliant last song. Mostly, the songs aren't long enough, really; ""OK Computer"" and ""The Bends"" are, let's face it, more ambitious, more complex, more driving, and just plain out more brilliant than this little album. Buy this after the other two, if at all."
2,skip this one,"I bought this CD in the mid/early ninties when I was taken with the dominant progressive rock movement. Yes, I heard the anthem 'creep' and bought the album based on that song, which is a decent song, but not revolutionary by any means. I was dissapointed by the rest of the album. I just couldn't make it through without getting bored. I was really taken with the pavement album 'wowee zowee' during this period (a classic prog rock album that I still love). Eventually I lost interest in alt rock altogether and wrote radiohead off as a boring band. but just two weeks ago I purchased OK Computer and realized that it really does live up to most of the hype. the improvement from 'pablo honey' to 'OK Computer' is staggering!Sometimes when you buy an album that you like, you want to go back and explore the artist's previous. Don't do that with radiohead. I can say that 'Pablo Honey' is not worth the money."
3,Not the best place to start a collection,"When you love a band's work, it's natural to look back at their earlier recordings and try to like them as much as later ones. Radiohead is without a doubt my favorite band ever, and every other album (including B-sides like the ""my iron lung"" EP) are amazing. But this album can only fairly be described as mediocre. There are flashes of brilliance on it (Ripcord, Blowout) but for the most part it is just more average early ninties guitar rock. If you only own OK Computer or The Bends, you will be disappointed. Buy this record after investing in all the others first, if for no other reason than to see how far they've come."
3,"More polished and radio-friendly, yet the emotion is there","I have to admit that I did in fact listen to the radiohead trilogy backwards, but this is perhaps for the best. In order to appreciate songs such as 'ripchord' and 'stop whispering', I think i needed to realize what the sound would be like if it wasn't a struggle for recognition. Need less to say, if I had listened to this album first I still would have continued on. To some degree, the excitement of this album is lost and replaced by the discomforting machine and computer effects on their later works. In the end, this album remains understated."
4,6 excellent songs....,"""Creep"" (esp. the clean version - the 'f-ing' seems juvenile), ""Thinking about you"", ""I can't"", ""Prove yourself"", ""Lurgee"", and ""Blow out"" are all classics that anyone who likes Radiohead will want to play *a lot*.This record is known as a minor Radiohead record (because it is!), but if it had been made by anyone other than Radiohead, it would be regarded as one of the best records of the early 90's (seriously, how many records released in the 90's have more than 6 great songs on them?). The same thing happens in other media: _The Killing_ is regarded as a minor Kubrick (because it is!), but if someone other than Kubrick had made it, it would be recognized as one of the two or three best noirs."
2,Nice Collection but why not Remastered?,"I bought this collector's edition set thinking that they were also remastered. They sound exactly like the CD I bought originally in 1993. The collection is nice, but it's unfortunate that they didn't go over and beyond to remaster the sound. I own their OK Computer Collector Edition as well and realized that all of these collector editions are not remastered. Radiohead has such beautiful sound and were not given the same treatment as the Beatles 2009 remaster albums. I won't be surprised to see these collector editions have another reissue with remaster sound."
2,thank goodness for Creep,"Even as dedicated of a Radiohead fan as I am, I really don't care much for this album. I say thank goodness for ""Creep"" because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did."
2,One day fly?,"Not my cup of tea... Sure, it's got ""Creep"" (wich is still their biggest hit song to date i guess) and i like ""You"", but the rest of the cd isnt that great really. Ive listened to it a few times - and most songs i don't even remember. Before Bends came out the critics called Radiohead a ""one day fly"". I can understand why. Thank God the Bends came out a few years later..."
3,Hinting at the genius to come,"There are a few songs on this disc that could stand proudly in the radiohead catalog, but all in all this is a band on autopilot, probably just realizing their own potential as they were busy making their debut a success for their investors..How quickly did they learn, thank goodness, of recording for themselves and not for anyone else."
3,"probably good, if you can hear it!!!!!!","Well, this album's pretty good. I don't know if it's just my cd or cd player but it's hard to hear. No, I'm not deaf. The first few songs are good. That's it. If you want good Radiohead, get Ok Computer, Kid A or somethin'."
1,One star for one good song!!!,"I think the only good song on this compact disc that is worth listening to is Creep, and that's just okay. All the other songs are toned down acoustic with lyrics that don't even make sense. Although, this taught me a lesson. Don't buy a compact disc unless you know more than one song off of it."
1,This one has always been a big disappointment,"Unfortunately this is one of those albums that has only one good song on it - in this case, Creep. I still love that song nearly 15 years after its release, but I've always found the rest of this album completely unbearable. I just can't make myself listen to any of the other songs. Thank god the ipod generation came along so I could copy that one song and forget about the rest of the album."
2,This CD is OK but not worth getting too excited about,"I recently bought this CD and was extreemly diapointed. I only ended up liking one song, ""Creep"". But, if your into music that sounds as though it was from the 80's, then this is a CD for YOU!!!"
4,"The guy from Isreal is a phool, this record is good.","Don't buy it if you already own a radiohead cd. The cd's must be heard in order. As far as pop fans who like paranoid anroid and go back and think this sucks, get off. This record is radiohead. Go listen to Will Smith if you don't like it. True Radiohead fans know the power behind these songs."
5,Classic Radiohead,Pablo Honey is an absolutely perfect album. Every song is excellent with some absolute classics like Creep and Anyone Can Play Guitar. The DVD concert footage really shows how powerful and intricate Radiohead's music and shows are. This is a must have.
4,"90s pop rock, as good as it is going to get","While I know most people buy this album for the track ""Creep"" there are other good tracks as well. It took me a while to like these tracks (like at least 4 or 5 listens) after that it stuck with me. There are some very catchy pop tunes on here. ""Stop Whispering,"" ""You,"" ""How Do You?,"" and ""Vegetable"" are some of the most memorable tracks. It is worth buying this especially if you are a fan of 90s pop/rock."
5,??,"No one reviewed this?! Goodness Gracious.Well, most likely if you listen to Radiohead, you started with the Bends or OK Computer. That's the norm. Even though this sounds nothing like the Radiohead you might know, it is still very much Thom Yorke and the crew. This album is very average of the british rock scene, but still has it's unique points, like of course, Thom Yorkes voice. Lyrical obscurity isn't really an issue on this album as it might be with future releases, but all in all, it's a great album."
4,Pablo Honey - modern retro chic,"Radiohead's Pablo Honey was the album which almost made their reputation as the best musical act to come out of Britain since the Beatles. Its punk guitar driven songs and almost physically addictive hooks and riffs combined with its teen angst lyrics to make album of raw power and little sublety. Apart, of course, from the seminal ""Creep"", a fabulous song which is as timeless as it is anthemic. Pablo Honey is an album which has become more and more popular as Radiohead themselves have assumed icon status, but in its own right it deserves to be cherished as a superb example of guitar lead rock."
3,"A couple of great songs, but...","Obviously this isn't a patch on the other two but there are some high points. Once you get past dross like Anyone Can Play Guitar (vastly overrated and corny) and How Do You, most of the songs are quite reasonable. Far and away the best songs are Creep and Blow Out. Everyone knows about Creep but I'm surprised the final track has received so little attention. Blow Out is the song that most indicates the band's future direction; it's a stunning mix of mellow late night vibes and explosive sonic uproar (god, that sounds so NME - my most sincere apologies!). Try and see it live on one of their videos, it's quite an experience."
3,Your normal Band's first album,"It is Radiohead's first release, and you can tell. However it is more than just the Creep album, as you can find the hint of the Radiohead talent just ready to explode and take all of us by force, in songs like You, and Anyone Can Play Guitar. I recomend it to anyone who loved the other Radiohead albums, and thoes Alt-rock fans who have an open mind, and gives albums more than one chance. Pablo Honey gets better everytime I hear it."
4,awesome debut from an overlooked band,"I have always overlooked Radiohead I always thought they were a soft rock band like Kyruss, U2 or Coldplay and so I never gave them a chance until recently. This album rocks hard and is the only Radiohead album I've gotten into I have yet to discover The Bends or OK Computer I'm still to busy listening to this amazing debut so I can't say right now that this is there best album. Once I am done with this album I am going to move on to there later work. There is not one bad song on this album but there does seem to be a few filler tracks which is the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. If your a fan of 90's alternative rock like me pick this album up you won't be disappointed."
3,Cool...but not anywhere near radiohead's other releases.,"I suppose that I would have given a more positive review of this CD if I had listened to it before I listened to Radiohead's masterpieces like the Bends, OK Computer, KID A, and the yet-to-be-released Amnesiac, but I din't. This is a nice grunge album, at its very best equaling Nirvana in music quality, but it is not as experimental yet still pleasing to the ear as OK or ""Bends"", or as whacked out but still devilishly cool as Kid A or Amnesiac. Still, a good introduction to one of the world's greatest bands."
3,Good but not their Best,"My first radiohead CD was OK Computer, and that is my advice to you, buy OK Computer first, then buy the Bends, Kid A, and then buy Pablo Honey. Pablo has Creep and some other good songs but it's really only for the diehards. I think Kid A will still be popular in twenty years just like Darkside of the moon by Pink Floyd, but you should still buy OK Computer first. P.S. Don't forget about Coldplay."
4,Only four when compared to their latest works,Creep is of course great but I have not read any reviews even touch on Thinking About You. I heard this song on a boot-leg before I got the album and I think it is great. Although I like the Boot-Leg version better. (Note try to get your hands on a recording of Thom on July 11 '93 in San Francisco)
4,This album doesn't suck,"I know many, many radiohead fans think this album suck. But, I really don't think so. This song is famous for it's ""creep"". But you can listen to any other songs in this album and it stills appeal to me. In my opinon, Pablo > Amnsesiac. Man, i just think amnsesiac suk. Eventhough it's suppose to be recorded at the same time as Kid A. They just sound completely different. Kid-A, btw, owns. Anyway, ""You"", ""I can't"" are probably one of my favourite songs from Radiohead. Polyethylene part 1+2 owns too though, so does paranoid, so does the bends, so does climbing up the wall....whoa getting kinda high... my point is this album doesnt suck. Just cause everyone says it does (and i know MANY people havent even heard the whole album and just goes with the flow to look cool), you should still try it. Not their best work, but not their worst."
2,DONT LET THIS TURN YOU OFF,"Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles. That said, this is not the album for that reason. Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about. There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go. In the song ""Creep"", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant ""CHU-CHUNK"" made by Johnny Greenwood. SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. For the ""rockers"" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A. There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid. Thank you for your time."
1,Rubbish.,"Before The Bends- before OK Computer- before Kid A and Amnesiac, there was this. Pablo Honey. I look at reviews for this album and quite frankly, they piss me off. There is really nothing noteworthy on this album. At all. From Creep's boring rythms and Thom whinging painfully cliche'd lyrics over the top to Anyone Can Play Guitar's uhmm...well, the same thing, really- It all just adds up to one painfully cheesy album that really makes you question how on earth Radiohead managed to keep their indie cred.Now, don't get me wrong- I'm actually a huge Radiohead fan. But really, before OK Computer their work was just very unconvincing and lacked the attention to detail and artistic beauty that were the power behind albums like Kid A and OK Computer.If you're into emo, and gritty cliche' as hell brit-pop, then by all means get the album, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Not as good as their newer releases.,"I own Kid A and OK Computer and I love them. I have heard most of hail to the theif and it is excellent, so I heard Creep and decided to get Pablo Honey. This album doesn't stand up to the albums I've herad, it has less of their creative use of computer generated sound and the songs tend to sound too whiney,sad and very 90's rock without it. I listen to it 3 times and dedcided to get rid of it. sad."
2,"Good vocal rave, but not techno.","This is a good addition to the series, but this is all vocal rave, mostly with female vocal and a bit of male rapping. No real techno riffs, except in the first song by Capella. But even that isn't hardcore techno, it's basically the same exact riff as in Quadrophonia, just not as in your face. A lot of this music borders on being acid house. So, if that's your thing, get it. But if you're looking for classic techno from 1991/1992, this isn't it."
4,Steam cooking for everyone,Great instruction book on steam cooking. Contains recipes that are both simple and complex so there is a range to experiement with. Everything I have made from this book has been extraordinary. Highly recommend it.
5,???.......,"You figure Blue Note would remaster this by now. No really. I mean it's his most popular cd. But they decide to realease his more acsesible stuff. Why dosen't Blue Note release this... Do they they just sit there and pick out of a box? If there is a good reason I'll understand. But from what I know there isn't. I don't have this cd ,but I know it's going to be good."
3,not the same without Bill,"I absolutely loved books 1 - 10. They were written in first person by the character Bill Gastner. In books 1 - 10, deputy Estelle was also there, but I just never really appreciated her character. She's a good cop, but not a good lead for the books. In this book, I'm about 20% done. Not sure if I'll finish it, but I'm going to try. This book is written in third person and Estelle is the lead. Bill is in the book, but it's just not the same.Maybe her character will be developed more and I'll grow to like her, but for now, without Bill as the lead, the series just isn't the same."
2,Why are we re-releasing when so much not out at all,Why is the BBC spending money and resources re-releasing titles that have already been put out on DVD when great titles have yet to be released? This isn't even that great a story. Always found this one a bit boring. We get this again yet we still don't have Death to the Daleks or Terror of the Zygons on DVD? I don't get it BBC.
2,psp headphones for cheap,"not the best or most reliable remote for your psp. It will work for a while, you get what you pay for."
4,difficult to please,"Although on the heavy side, I have bought a number of the ""eyewitness travel guides"" because they are easy to use, and have great pictures - which is very important to me indetermining which places I want to visit, what food I would like to try and so on. The maps are ok, but do not include all the sites in the book. I tried to get the ""streetwise"" map for the trip because they are awesome, but they don't publish any of Istanbul. Although the guide isn't perfect it is better than the competition - I recommend it."
5,Great Istanbul Guide,"We love the Eyewitness travel guides. This item was advertised as used in good condition. It is in very good to excellent condition, and a great travel guide. Excellent maps, photos, diagrams and breakdowns to different areas of the city. There are very good sections on history, transportation, dining, and recommendations for tour routes and itineraries. Excellent item at a great price!"
4,historical information about istanbul,This is a very colorful book with bright pictures and maps of Istanbul. Not a travel guide but an interesting read abouut history for you long journey to Istanbul.
5,Istanbul (Eyewitness Travel Guides),I love the EYEWITNESS TRAVEL GUIDE series. These books are just packed with information about places we will be visiting. I've watched some documentaries and then am surprised to see information from those documentaries captured in the book. The maps are fabulous.Delivery was fast.
4,Istanbul,It is a beautiful book. The pictures and information are great. Has lots of helpful information.
1,Istanbul (Eyewitness Travel Guides),"This book is a travesty, not a travel guide. I found it really lacking in substance. Mostly pictures, not much text, lots of platitudes designed to dazzle you, and made of heavy paper that is a drag to carry around."
1,Istambul (Eyewitness Travel Guides),I can not make my review by the simple reason that I did not received yet the book i've bought one month ago.RegardsRoberto Felicio Coimbra
5,I love it!,"Love the digital frame, the pictures are very clear and easy to load. Great deal for the price."
4,Good Pictures,"I ordered this gift for my mom for Christmas. I was scared as it wasnt a really expensive one, and I assumed you get what you paid for. But this frame works great, just put in your disk and watch the slideshow. The pictures have a really good quailty. The only reason I labeled it a 4, is because I know there are better opnes out there, but they cost more money. Also I havent played with all of the features. But my overall vote: a very good digital picture frame."
3,Kodak Dig picture frame,There are not sufficient instructions for downloading pictures to the frame and it is user friendly only if you use Kodak easy share software which I do not want or need .
2,Just OK - Not Worth the Money!,"The picture quality was a disappointment; you can actually see the pixels but it should be fine for Grandma. If you buy this for someone you will also have to buy either a memory card or a flash drive, since there is no internal memory (the Amazon description does not explicitly state this). The directions are also very brief and do not really tell you anything. The Easy Share software is really good for other things but does not really have a direct relationship with the picture frame; seems to be designed more for printing and burning cds."
3,Works OK but not perfect,Could never get the frame to download photo from my Mac. The only way was to use a memory card to get photos on the frame. It looks good and is a nice unit for the price.
4,Picture Frame,Great frame; this is actually my second Kodak. My only issue is I couldn't figure a way to sort the songs and images. The frame seems to not follow the proper naming sort logic.
4,"Good frame, though pricey!","My boyfriend and I bought one of these for each of our desks at work and are quite happy with our purchase. Some of the photos are a bit pixelated at times, but the frame definitely serves its purpose and I have received many compliments on it.I chose to only give this frame 4-stars because I think it was a little pricey for being a very basic frame. However, loading photos on to the memory card was very simple, and the frame serves it purpose of allowing me to see my most favorite photos throughout the day. And the remote control is a really great feature."
2,Ordering Problems bad screen resolution,"Tried to buy the EX wi-fi version but it seems that Amazon is having a lot of trouble on actually shipping the correct product. I recieved the 7 inch low end model but was chared the top of the line price. Beware when ordering here, I've also noticed prices changing on items from screen to screen. So you can't be sure that you will be able to get what you pay for until the work the bugs out of the system.But since I had already turned it on, the screen resolution was very low and not worth buying for the professional photographer since the other higher res screen models look much better."
1,Total C.R.A.P. on a good day....,"If I could give a negative number on this product I would. What a total bass ackwards system this thing is. I feel like I am in the stone ages trying to set the clock on one of the first VHS players that ever came out. The settings are worthless and for the most part don't work well, or at least as they should. They allow a frame time of 3, 10, 30 seconds etc. I set it on 3. The first picture was 3 seconds, the second picture was 10 seconds, the third picture was 15 seconds, the fourth picture was 8 seconds. You get the picture. NO consistency what so ever. Also, the so called smart feature to interpret which way a picture should go is wrong at times, and guess what, there is NO WAY to adjust it. So, in short, avoid Kodak. They are like Sony. ALL name, NO product."
3,too small,turned out to be too small a picture size. Unless you are at eye level right in front of it you cant see well. picture quality was fine and easy enough to get started but am returning it for a slightly larger display.
3,Close but not quite,"I bought this particular frame because of price and other reviews. While I am not totally disliking the frame I am a little disappointed with some of the features. There is an option to turn the frame off at night and then back on in the morning. It turns off and on fine but will not start showing pictures again without intervention. Managing pictures and music on the frame is PAINFULLY slow. The screen is great, clear and sharp though."
3,the picture is not very clear,"I red the reviews about this product before I bought it, but when I got it , I found the picture is not clear and seemed very rough, so I returned it. But I think the service of amazon is really good, since I didn't think it was so easy to return a product and they took care of it so quickly, so at the end I should say I am very satisfied with the purchase experience from amazon although not every product will satisfy us! thanks"
4,Nice frame,I bought this for my mom. It is simple to use. I was dissapointed that the frame has no internal memory. Otherwise a good product.
4,"Good idea, frame overpowering",This is a good product and great for the office. The only complaint is the frame is huge! Easily twice the size of the picture area. That is the only complaint. Otherwise a great product with decent easy to use features.
5,Great for photography lovers,"I bought a couple of these as Mother's Day presents when they were the Gold Box Deal of the Day. They were a great deal at around $70 each. Neither of the recipients were likely to ever buy a digital photo frame for themselves, but I was amazed at how quickly they had pictures displaying on the frame. One even got used at her parents' 60th anniversary party, and it was a great hit.This model doesn't have any internal memory, but that wasn't a problem as both recipients had memory cards laying around that were really too small for taking photos, but they held plenty of photos for display. The power timer function is great to help make sure that the frame is used without wasting power. The power on and power off times can be set to any desired time."
2,I would go with a different digital frame.,Make sure the frame you order has internal memory. The software this frame comes with is usless. The quality of the pictures is less than average.
1,Kodak Easyshare - Zero Stars,"I ordered this product from Electronica Direct or some such store through Amazon and ended up returning it. The product's manual didn't explain everything and simple as a digital picture frame ought to be to use, this one was not created by someone who plans to use it. The software it comes with actually makes it difficult to get pictures into the frame! I ended up using other photo software that I own, but the quality of this product just isn't up to snuff with some of the others out there. I've never had luck with Kodak products, or at least never liked them, they always seem to be behind the ball when it comes to competing with other companies in new technology. I should have known better.I ended up returning it. Unfortunately, that's going to cost me a 20% restocking fee at this company. Guess I missed the fine print. Amazon shouldn't even be dealing with them."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought the frame for my parents so I could send them new pictures via e-mail- which is much easier than standard pictures.Since my parents are not the tech savy type, i decided to do the setupof the frame and load all the pictures already before wrapping the gift.Surprise, surprise... The frame does not recognise the MOV. files forthe videos. I contacted Kodak, and after a few e-mails back and forth and upgrading the firmware as recomended, I have still the same problem with the frame.One would think that paying a premium when buying Kodak products provides you with a certain peace of mind that you won't have those type of problems, but it looks like I would have been much better buying a cheaper brand.Very disapointed with that product. The minimum Kodak could do is test the software correctly before putting products in the market. Won't buy Kodak stuff anymore."
4,Power supply is 110V only,"Power supply is 110V only, so don't go buying this for any friends in Europe or the rest of the world. It is also pretty difficult to find a 12V 2A power supply to replace the one provided.Other than that it does what it says on the tin."
5,Kodak Easyshare SV-710 7-inch Digital Picture Frame,"This was very easy to use right out of the box. I was able to drag and drop pictures to it without using the Easy Share software.I've had many compliments on this product, and people are surprised at the clarity of the pictures. I am very happy with it.I find most of the comments here are for multiple versions of Kodak frames, so it is hard to tell which frame is being commented on.Kodak Easyshare SV-710 7-inch Digital Picture Frame"
2,some disappointment in this frame,"I've used my digital frame for almost a year, and have been disappointed with some of my experiences with the frame. The biggest problem is that despite assurances from Kodak representatives that photos will displate in name order, they do not. I have not been able to determine any consistent way the frame displays photos -- not name, date, order placed on card, etc. There are also times that part way through a slide show, the frame just restarts from the beginning (or what it thinks is the beginning).Also, I bought it knowing about the 16:9 aspect ratio, which has been more of a problem than I suspected. There are many pictures with important part of the picture chopped off at the top and bottom unless shown in the ""fit entire image"" option, which leaves black bars on either side of the photo."
3,digital frame,"The frame is a typical digital frame for under $100, which means it has no internal memory. You must use a zip drive or memory card.Using the zip drive allows you to keep the pictures you want and add/delete as needed. But its ugly sticking out from the side.The pictures are sharp and clear , and this model has a remote, but it doesn't respond well or quickly at times.All in all , it does what its supposed to do , but If I had to do it again, I would have upgraded to a better more expensive frame."
4,Parents gift,Bought this for my parents for christmas and they love it and it has good picture quality
2,Not what I hoped for,"I bought this 7 inch frame as a gift for my parents. Perhaps I didn't fully read the item description as I thought the frame had some internal memory, it does not. I have no complaints about the set up or transfer of pictures to the frame. I am disappointed in the picture quality, the resolution just wasn't what it should have been, again maybe my fault for not understanding the description. I guess I got what I paid for."
1,I sent it back,"The problem with this photo frame is that the display is widescreen 16:9, but my digital photos are standard photo format 4:3 so the images were getting chopped off. There is an option to display the entire photo but that shrunk the images down so much they were not worth looking at. If Kodak made a photo frame that used a standard photo format, that would make sense. This frame was no good for my photos."
1,arrow buttons didn't work,"The pictures were fine but but the left and right buttons didn't work and you couldn't check or uncheck pictures. At my expence, I could send in theremote and Kodak would replace it hoping that would fix it..."
1,Product is a trick,"One major problem: the SV710 simply displays pictures from a thumbdrive, a memory stick, xD card, etc. It is impossible to actually save photos to the frame - your card, thumbdrive, etc must stay in the frame for it to function.Useless for it's designed purpose. You may as well put a slide show on your tv or computer and save your money."
2,Kodak SV-710 hasn't the best resolution...,"Save your money and buy a Digital Picture Frame with more resolution. Its worth the extra investment. This Kodak is ok for the money, but better resolution is the way to go.."
1,No internal memory on the SV710!,"I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.First of all, I placed a pre-order as the item would be available April 30th and shipped out at that time. Today is May 22nd, I just got it today! Horrible!Second, it states ""128 MB internal memory"", yet in the manual it says you cannot copy pictures into this model!The picture quality isn't that great.This WAS supposed to be a birthday present for my dad, how embarassing. I will be returning it!!"
2,Not happy,"Power adapter doesnot work after after first tow day... :(Also, copying pictures using easyshare software is not intutive."
2,SV-710 resolution is only 480 x 234,"We bought the SV-710 for Mom because it was the most popular digital frame on Amazon at the time. I can't imagine why it's so popular. The resolution is very poor, and Amazon doesn't even tell you what the resolution is in their product description.It's a paltry 480x234, and it really shows (i.e., pics are grainy).And the 16:9 aspect ratio doesn't help either. Your pics will be cropped to fit that aspect ratio.If we were to purchase another digital frame, we'd go with a higher resolution and more standard 4:3 aspect ratio."
4,Works great!,"Nice looking, easy to use. Takes about five minutes to figure out how it works. Good contrast and a wide angle of view.If you don't want to spend too much on digital photo frame, I recommend picking these one. If you are looking for better technical specs go to the more expensive models."
3,Ripped off by Amazon and Ace Digital Photo,"I purchased this item from Ace Digital Photo a so called Amazon approved vendor, and later found that I pain $100.00 over the price at Kodak. Neither Amazon or Ace would make any refund.I suggest that nobody shop at Ace Digital or even Amazon if they are not willing to stand up for their loyal customers."
2,Castleview,"What a disappointment! I had just finished reading Gene Wolfe's monumental duology, ""Shadow and Claw"" and ""Sword and Citadel,"" arguably one of the most erudite, complex and unique fantasy tales ever written, only to have my expectations dashed by this piece of juvenile prose filled with poorly drawn characters. The premise was of some interest but the story could have been so much more compelling and enticing if it were not so shallow in style. Don't bother reading this one."
1,"So much promise, so little reward","In this frustrating and ultimately not-worthwhile book, Wolfe takes an incredible premise (an Arthurian castle that appears on the outskirts of a middle America town, but is only visable to certain people) and totally ruins it.Having read a great amount of Arthurian literature (both modern and classic - like Malory, de Troyes, and von Eschenbach), I can honestly say that the plot is incomprehensible. Very few characters have any parallel to Arthurian figures (other than an occasional name), and most of them behave in a completely bizarre fashion.I slugged my way through every last agonizing page in hopes that the end might clear up the mysteries of this book... only to be disappointed again. My only guess is that Wolfe wrote this book while on drugs, his publisher agreed to publish it based on his prior reputation alone, and that anyone who claims to have enjoyed it is a diehard Wolfe fan that won't admit that this book is a total failure."
1,ARG!,"This book was recommended to me by Library Thing. I wanted a little diversionary reading, checked around about Wolfe and found him very highly rated.I only wish I had read these reviews first. ARG! This guy might have some great stuff, but I will never know because of Castleview. A total mess, completely incomprehensible, with many loose ends left untied.What happend to Sally's sister, among many other loose ends...I kept plowing through this thing thinking somehow, somewhere, it will begin to make sense.Arg and double arg!"
1,Buyer beware.,"The screen protectors don't stay on. I've placed them on the adhesive side and the corners slowly lift up and get air beneath it. It was also a complete hassle trying to apply them as tiny fibers, dust and hair gravitate towards the adhesive side creating unsightly air bubbles. Avoid Insted screen protectors and go with a slightly pricier brand. I bought them because they were cheap and I paid for it. I've never had problems like this with other screen protector brands."
3,Does not fit well,The kit is NOT for DS Lite. One protector is too small for the bottom screen the other too big for the top screen. Switching them around does not make them fit either. :)
5,GREAT item and FAST delivery,"Very fast delivery and it helps my ""ds"" screen to not be scratched!!! Thanks ALOT!!"
5,Mega Nutrition for Women,"I wish I had known about this book when it was first published. The doctor shares the results long years of research and successful treatment of his patients, and it all makes sense. Our biochemical bodies need biochemical fuels (from foods and if necessary from supplements) to be healthy, to function, and to carry out the tissue repairs required throughout life. This book stands head and shoulders above hundreds of others I've read in that this one makes it easy to understand that improved health is in the reach of almost everyone, even if one isn't very well right now. I'm learming, successfully utilizing the information, and feeling very well (and very hopeful) as a result. Can't thank Dr. Kunin enough for this simple common sense guide. I'm purchasing copies for friends."
4,So enjoyable!,"Maxi Priest is easy listening Reggae. Very enjoyable and upbeat, and some good ""message"" songs. He has a great voice, and a great style."
3,good stuff...,i was going through my cd collection and realized that i didn't have this cd--- it had gone missing... i had to replace it. it's got some great tunes on there and i didn't want to forget the memories associated with them.
1,Good premise flops horrible,Starting with a good premise (post nuclear holocaust) this book is a horrible addition to the genre. The entire book is nothing more than childlike characters engaging in adult practices. With no inhibitions or restraint. The characters are drab and unappealing. The description of the character is such that it is very difficult discern between the individuals with a few exceptions. The ending is not worth 250 pages of mindnumbing drivle you have to endure. This book is a romance with less of a plot than usual.
5,THIS CD IS GREAT,"This CD is so awesome. Her ""poplular"" songs aren't even the best ones!!! I especially LOVE...Cool, Clear Water, Dimming Of The Day, Storm Warning and Steal Your Heart Away...and of course You. This is a wonderful CD no matter what kind of mood you're in...or what you're doing. Bonnie is proving why she is so well loved!!!"
3,It is soo hard to assemble..,"Yes, it was almost impossible for me, a 10 year old child, to put half of the thing together. Also, the pieces werent clean. I had to have my dad do almost everything! What I did was try to clean the pieces. Man, I had to use a knife! This toy, in my opinion, is fun to play with once assembled, but it is the assembly that is impossible. It also doesnt educate at all, except on how to get it together. What I also found out is that it breaks very easily. And if you dont believe me, get one yourself and see how hard it is. I hope this review means something to you people."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I ordered this item for Xmas for my son, age 7. He normally is very good at putting things together (does large lego models by himself), but this one was definitely beyond him. Tools (needlenose pliers) were required to push in the the delicate wing pins referred to below, and the legs are constantly coming off, which is definitely frustrating for a child (and the parent too). Visually, there are small ""tags"" left on the model where each piece was detached from the plastic frame, which I find unappealing. Finally, after less than a week of play one of the key body pins broke off, which is pretty much the end of the Stikfas play value. I'll go with the legos next time!"
5,Loving a Black Man&#65533;,"""It's a mystery, and at this moment, that's okay."" Dr. Elmore teaches that loving a Black Man as a Black Woman requires patience, understanding, kindness, and unselfishness. (1Cor. 13:4) Dr. Elmore's guidance provided answers to questions that every Black Woman wants to know. I recommend this book not only to ""the sisters"" but to ""the brothers"" as well."
5,"Kudos to you, Dr. Elmore","This book was so straight forward and informative that I wanted to devour it in one reading. But instead I took my time and put Dr. Elmore's practical advice to work. Although I am not presently in a relationship with a Black man, I believe that I will have a better understanding of how to give and get love without compromising myself or my future partner' wants and needs. I gained a tremendous amount of insight into my non-productive relationship patterns and am now on a search for ways ""compromise on my practices, without compromising my principles"". Thanks Dr. Elmore for such a wonderful book!!!!"
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS PERSON,"I WOULD REVIEW THE PRODUCT BUT I NEVER EVER RECEIVED IT... I didn't force the issue because I wasn't charged, but NEVER again!"
4,Knowing Yourself In Order to Love Your Black,"I think this book should be called ""Understanding Yourself So That You can Better Love Your Black Man"". This book is more than just learning how to love your black man. It helps you to identify certain actions that may hurt or hinder your relationship. If I had read this book prior to meeting my fiance, I believe I would have saved us both some pretty heavy ""conversations"". If you read this book with an open mind, I'm sure you will learn alot about yourself and your man. It has help me to gain a better understanding of him and his actions, and for me understanding is the first step to acceptance."
3,basic information & boring,the book was ok. it is stating the same information most women already know.i rated 3 star because it does venture out into different avenues but it is still basic.
4,OK!,"This book is beautiful. Please understand the suggestions/advice in this book are not merely for black men or women who are with black men. It is by a black man, from a black man's point of view, for the women who are with black men, yes, but you can make good use of the advice in this book with ANY man in your life. The only thing is this book is not written in an anglo style. I love it because I love my black men and the advice is sound in the book. It is also great to be able to determine what kind of lover you are and even if your relationship is love or other stuff that are only substitutes for love. overall give it a read!"
5,A book that destroys the phobias associated with love,"I believe that so many people destroy the fabric of a potential relationship through the fear of not knowing the basic everyday functions of a healthy relationship. This book has given us the tools to tackle our fears and inhibitions. Dr. Elmore has so successfully placed before black women a much needed, well-balanced meal of love for the most fascinating people on earth... black men! Now we can enjoy love without not fearing the unknown!"
4,The Dictionary For Women,"Here is a much more entertaining book called The Dictionary For Women.Fun, relatable, and great for a girlfriend-get togetherVisit thedictionaryforwomen.comOrhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Dictionary-for-Women-ebook/dp/B006X1S6EM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327185540&sr;=8-2"
3,Alice Cooper - 'Take 2' (WEA International),"I've recently seen this 2-CD import available in a friend/music dealer's sale list for $5.99. Reason I didn't get it was because I already have the two CD titles that's included in this offering. 2000's 'Brutal Planet' and the 22-track anthology compilation 'The Definitive Alice Cooper'. Today, Alice turns 59. I'm a huge fan, but I don't feel the need to get EVERY single pressing of every single CD title that's put out with his name stamped on it. If you don't have 'Brutal Planet',this would be the way to go. Completists, rejoice!"
2,Why combine these two?,"I see no point as to why these two albums have been combined. The Definitive album is Alice's greatest hits (tho i'd have cut off the last two tracks and included Go To Hell and Clones) and the second album is Alice Cooper's DeathMetal album Brutal Planet which I dont think the two albums go together nicely.I'd rather see Definitive and Classics combines or a compilation of the greatest hits after 1980 to the present. Or Brutal Planet and Dragontown together... but this one... well, if you dont have either album and you want them, it might be OK, but the combination of these two is going to definitly let you hear the difference between the era's."
5,Major Improvement!!,"These books are so much better than the old SVH series because the twins in the old books were perfect. The twins face real life situations in these, and as a whole the series is so much better. Liz and Conner are so great for each other! They better get hooked up!"
3,Mending Your Heart in a Broken,This book is ideal for my free lending library I have been setting up for women I mentor. The chapters are short. Scriptures are used as well as personal testimony. It is very suitable for those women who are young in faith.-- Elaine Given
3,Facinating story marred by poor writing.,"I thought this was going to be a great book. The story included the struggles of a pioneer woman, romance, and descriptions of women's lives within a plural marriage.Unfortunately, I was often distracted by the writing style and the poor grammar. I found myself rereading whole paragraphs to understand what had happened. The writer switched from past tense, to present tense to past tense within one paragraph. She often jumped from one thought to something completly different in one paragraph. The writer used a style of desciption that featured incomplete sentences. (Just the noun and adjectives, no verb.) It seemed like they were rapid flashbacks. They did not register with me. Most of all I disliked the long quotes from speeches by leaders of the Morman church.I expected to love this book, and I did like it at first, but there were just too many distractions for me to get into the characters and story."
1,don't buy this,"This Amazon entry is a shim-sham. An endless line of marketplace sellers either seem ignorant (of the actual entry) or they're trying to rake some poor buyer over the coals with an inflated price. Before you buy this item here, check out the real entry for Saint Germain des Pres Cafe's#4."
3,Kind of violent at the end!!,"We purchased this book for our 2-year old based on someone's recommendation. The book is kind of cute but be warned. At the end of the book all the cats get into a big fight, eat or kill each other and only one is left standing. We were surprised at how violent it was at the end."
4,Beautiful illustrations -- odd story,The illustrations more than the text make this story. If you stop to think about what happens to all the cats it's a bit disturbing. A similar and more delightful book is Cats for Kansas.
5,cats,i remember my brother reading this book to me when i was 10 years old it is a favorite of mine the old man reminds me of my brother
4,Delightful beginning reader,A classic tale of a lonely man and woman who are looking for a cat. Great pattern reader. Excellent moral about vanity and how it is all consuming.
5,a childhood favorite,"My grandmother was a teacher's aid and shared many wonderful books with me throughout my childhood. ""Millions of Cats"" was one of them. The illustrations are simple and beautiful, as is the story. Now, I share this book with my children, and they are delighted by this tale of an elderly couple's quest for the perfect cat."
4,Great book for cat lovers.,I remembered this book from my childhood. It is the cute and sentimental story of an older couple looking for a single cat but millions show up.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book based on all the positive customer reviews and was very disappointed in the book.I read the book to my four year old daughter and then had to answer a very long list of questions about why all the cats were fighting and what happened to the other 999,999 cats. Are we the only ones that don't like this book??"
2,Strange Book,"I had to replace a misplaced copy for my son but we read this book initially and it was morbid and depressing. It was written in 1928 and I have no idea why it is still in print. I almost wanted to replace this book with another title if only to save other students from thinking this was a cute book about cats only to find out it was the thing of nightmares. With so many cute, fun, light-hearted children's books out there I would not select this to go in our personal library."
2,Lovely book - except for the CAT FIGHT,"So, someone gave us this ""classic"" book which they loved and wanted to share with us. Well, I read it to my 2 year old today only to find that there is a huge cat fight (""They bit and scratched and clawed each other..."") to be the prettiest cat and they all kill each other (""...have eaten each other all up...""). I guess I just didn't like that they all kill each other save one. Just thought you ought to know - I was surprised to see such positive reviews."
5,Not to be Missed,"The first time I heard of Wanda Gag, I was helping my father clean out his mother's house after she died. We came upon Millions of Cats in a box of books, and upon seeing the cover, my father starting reciting from memory a book he hadn't seen or read in more than 40 years. To stay with someone that long, to capture the heart of a child tight enough to carry that child into adulthood, speaks volumes about a story, in this case, Millions of Cats. I have since been introduced to Gag's The Funny Thing, my personal favorite, and can only hope that more children grow up on such beautiful, poignant and funny stories. My children certainly will."
5,Charming!,"A quick, simple and silly tale with space for imagination. It reads with a soft voice and just enough rhythm. What happens to a pond when millions and trillions of cats each take a sip from it?"
4,Charming children's story,This story is so darling. I purchased it for my 4 year old. She loves it! The idea of finding so many cats just delighted her. I would highly recommend this for other youngsters.
1,They really messed up on this one,"Due to the complex pronunciation system in Chinese, getting started in studying Chinese for a beginner can be quite difficult. So, it makes sense that this book/cd starts with practicing the pronunciation. This portion is essential. BUT, as noted in the other review (which I sorely wished I read before buying this), the order of words/phrases in the CD do not correspond to the book.For those who have already bought this book, you can decipher the order of reading for the first few lessons. The word lists were probably originally printed in a four column format and then moved to a two column format.Originally:A 1 D 4B 2 E 5C 3 F 6(letters are the Chinese words, numbers are the English words)Then moved to:A 1D 4B 2E 5C 3F 6The people making the audio recording were obviously reading off of the original format, left column then right column. So, if you understand the difference in structure, you can compensate for this mess."
1,Not what I'd hoped,"I've been spoiled by Pimsleur, having used Pimsleur materials to study other languages. This approach is light years behind and very cumbersome. I don't recommend it."
3,Required reading for a democracy.,"As usual, full of information, knowledge, and insight... This is my 3rd Phillips book and would rate 5 stars except for some huge ommissions. While pointing out the drain on our democracy of ""entitlements"", lawyers & litigation, duplication in govt... he completely omits the financial and social costs of our massive military expenditures. Also, while criticizing home ownership as ""sopping up large amounts of capital thus made unavailable for industrial renewal"" he misses the huge piles of capital in corporate coffers and private holdings looking for higher and higher rates of return, not in ""industrial renewal"" but more often in the ""spectronics"" he illustrates. Still, Phillips does fine work, one of the few conservatives that speaks with a straight tongue."
5,The unheralded Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land Quintet,"This was the first recorded colloboration of one of the most underrated quintets of the 60's, the Bobby Hutcherson/Harold Land Quintet. This group advanced many of the concepts of the great Coltrane quartet and added a few of their own in the modal vein--but they never forgot to swing. Many of the best pianists of the period--Joe Sample, Chick Corea or Stanley Cowell--played in this group. Fortunately, Corea is on hand here fresh from his own classic recording, ""Now He sings, Now He sobs"", to merge brilliantly with this group. Hutcherson, himself, is at his peak and Land already a hard bopper fits comfortably in the Coltrane mode. Dig the beginning track, ""Herzog"", an Hutcherson original and then segue into the boppish, ""Matrix"", a Corea original. Revel in the midst of these giants!!"
3,I thought it could have been so much more,"This is an easy book to read and then forget. I liked the author's writing really more than I did the plot of the book. It was bogged down in too much romance and I didn't feel the main characters had any real depth to them.I need a more believable plot and I need more of it, that's why I read Historical romance instead of romance. This is definitely not a page turner but worth the read if you don't have anything better to do."
5,Another 5 star book for Kresley Cole!,"The reigning queen of sexual tension does it again. A highly satisfying read if you're in the mood for: scorching sexual tension, high emotions, all-consuming love, and brilliantly written love scenes. I highly recommend this book."
3,Starts off with great anticipation...,"Just like any 'missing person' story, this starts off so well... and then when the characters finally find each other (on a deserted island), it kind of goes downhill for me from there. The captain does his best to 'trap' the missing girl, and she does her best to thwart his attempt to trap her. It all seems kind of childish. I'm not sure that this is REALLY how characters would react (it just came across as a little bit juvenile).The characters were fun and had a good connection once they were aboard the ship to go home (that's not really a spoiler) and had a chance to show their true colors, beyond their immature behavior earlier on the island, for which I appreciated the book, but I almost didn't read past the first half to get to the second good half.If you're wavering on this and it seems to not be what you hoped for, keep reading. It does get a little better."
3,Only read it cuz its one of Kresley Coles first,"Cole is a great story teller and I'm in love with her immortals after dark series. I felt like I needed to read her earlier work because I respect her so much.Historical romances about Captians and ship wrecks aren't my thing, but this was a enjoyable fun read. Funny too.The main charater is a joy to read, she is strong, funny, wicked, and smart. The Hero was somewhat cold but you A-typical Man's man. The sidekicks were likable as well."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I love other books by Kresley Cole, specificly the Imortals After Dark series. This didn't even seem to be written by the same person. The heroine was a spoiled,TSTL little girl, and the hero was selfish and self absorbed. All of their interactions seemed to be like two 13 year olds from juinor high school. I frankly couldn't even finish the book."
5,Movin on up,"I liked the first book Mrs. Cole wrote, and I liked this one even better. I liked every character. I liked the plot. I loved the interaction between the characters. Everything matched up. Everything but our main characters personalities. They were as diferent as night and day. Opposites attract, and let me tell you, it is very entertaining to watch Victoria try to loosen up Grant. Great book"
2,Couldn't compare to his brother....,"Overall, I somewhat enjoyed the book, but not nearly as the first one. Since I have read all of the IAD series thus far, excellent series by the way, I figured why not check out her earlier projects? Well, I can honestly say that Kresley Cole has come a long way from her earlier works. The story was written well enough, but lacked vision and a good climax in this particular book. I would definitely suggest the first book, but not this one."
2,HUGE LETDOWN,"Until now, I have adored Kresly Coles's books and have ALL of them. I thought the hero was a bit wishy washy at first but once he reconciled his actions with himself - he was ALL IN. The heroine, however, I just wanted to SMACK her. Repeatedly. Until she agreed to stop being so utterly childish, selfish and irritating. Seriously, her whole attitude is extremely childish in the ""play my way or I'll take my toys and go home"" kind of way.If I had been reading this book in paperback form instead of on my beloved Kindle, I would have flung it across the room out of absolute disgust.I DID NOT EVEN FINISH THE BOOK."
4,Price of Pleasure,Gave it 4 stars b/c it was well written. She has really good flow. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first mainly b/c I wanted to hit Grant over the head several times! Could have used a little more suspense. Hope to see a book about Ian!
4,A must read,"This book was awesome, everything was perfectly done, you have your typical cold Englishman who seems to feel nothing but is secretly and wildly passionate, then you have your heroine, who was stranded for 9 years on an island and finally rescued by the hero who was paid by her grandfather to find her.I found her writing style a bit similar to Brenda Joyce but she has a unique spin in her own right. Don't want to give it all away but it is a worthy read for women who want to travel in time and find a heroine and hero who was worth your precious time."
4,The Price of Pleasure,"The book is well written, holding one's interest from the start. It doesn't lag, and has very few places with ""filler"" information.The style is good, in keeping with the period for which written."
3,The Price of Pleasure,I thought this book was entertaining. I usually don't read historic romances but I did enjoy this one.
5,SHADOWFAX COMES ALIVE ON THIS ONE,SHADOWFAX BRING FULL POWER ON LIVE CD. IF LIKE THIS GROUP. YOU'LL LOVE THIS ONE. MUST HAVE.THE SOUND ON THIS CD IS PURE ENERGY.
3,"Great when it's working, Possibly salvageable!","Hi all. I bought this lantern and fell in love with it. I used it for one season, packed it away and alas, as many of you have said, it no longer works. As I read the directions and reviews here, I opened the battery cover and took a look. I suspect the battery is dead and herein lies the problem.Contrary to the directions, I would suggest NOT cutting the wires. The battery can easily be removed by pressing the small tabs on each contact and pulling the wire off the battery. Might be best to use a rubber handled tool to prevent shock. But, the battery IS replaceable and can be purchased online here or at Radio Shack for approx. $12! No need to junk the whole thing.That doesn't make up for the company's complete lack of regard for it's customers but at least it's not a total waste.I hope this helps someone."
1,Poor performance,"I've had this lantern for less than a year. The battery will no longer recharge. Since the battery cannot be replaced, the lantern is now junk."
2,Dumb design,"Seems like a great idea: Fluorescent tube lantern with a high/low setting, LED nightlight, rechargeable battery, and both AC and DC adapters that hide in the lantern's base.Except that: you can't turn the lantern on while it is charging; it is pretty fragile; and the battery is hard-wired in and can't be replaced without some soldering. Plus the battery takes forever to recharge, almost an entire day."
1,JUNK,"After one year and three camping trips, it no longer holds a charge. New battery for $12, but why waste the money? So it will die in another year after three or four more camping trips? I'm thowing this piece of junk away and buying a coleman."
1,Not Recommended,"The SwissGear Lantern did not last. Ours was used three times over the last 18 months. Now, it will not take a charge."
1,Great until it Quits,I loved this lantern! It worked great for about 14 months (just out of warranty year) and the battery will no longer hold a charge. I contacted the manufacturer and was advised I can not buy a battery. I would have to buy a new lantern. As much as I like the lantern it just doesn't last. I wouldn' buy another one.
1,Same Problem,"Battery will no longer accept a charge, lantern is junk, in the process of contacting company for exchange/refund/repair, I will let you know if we have any luck."
1,Unsalvageable,"I found a new-looking SwissGear sitting next to a dumpster at a campground and thought I might try to fix it. Sometimes people are not competent to use things properly. I have never bought a vacuum cleaner because there's always a perfectly repairable one in the dumpster. Well, this lantern may never have worked properly. Only the LED night light works. The batter charges but the fluorescent lights don't work. The internal circuit boards don't pass juice to the bulbs. I can't fix circuit boards. I'll stick with my wind-up Coleman lantern. The light is small but it also charges cell phones and has a radio too."
1,I found a replacement battery,"Like almost everybody, my Swissgear rechargeable lantern stop charging in one season.I forgot for while but I kept last 4-5 years. Today, I found the battery for this unit.6 Volt 4AH Rechargeable Sealed Lead Acid SLA Battery 6 volt 4ampBrandUPGOur SKU3300650PartUB645EBALT14Good luck to everybody share the problem."
1,Same as majority,"I had the same problem with this lantern. Worked only one trip a few years ago. I pulled it out this year and was trying to see if I could fix it. After reading these reviews, I won't even bother. I hope the company is taking note of this."
2,Not very bright.,Was hard to keep charged did not hold a charge long at all and broke very easy.would not buy again
1,Junk lantern- do not buy!,"I bought two of these, and used them once on a camping trip. Put them away to keep for hurricane season. But, as others stated, when I took them out again, they wouldn't charge. The green light would come on when charging, but they would not light. Only the night light would come on for about a minute. Definately do not waste your money on these!"
2,Good till middle of series,This anime started out well but towards the middle it started to get really bad. I started to think it was for little kids once a lttle fairy came into one of the episodes and started doing stupid childish things. This anime has a Tv-14 rating but it should really be Tv-pg because there is hardly any violence except for a little bit of blood in one of the first episodes. I hardly recall any swearing but there was some suggestive content but nothing above pg. If you are older and looking for a more mature anime I would suggest Nabari because there is more fghting and it is more mature. This was a major dissapointment because the previews made the show look kind of cool.
2,Mediocre. Cliche. Boring. Garbage.,"First off, I have to say that I paid 3 dollars at big lots, and I'm still giving it a bad review. I would give this 3 stars, but b/c Amazon is selling for 50,so I'm giving 2.The first episode starts off showing us a cold-hearted black sheep, who oh my goodness uses wind magic instead of fire! The first episode is great and I had a good feeling about this series, but it all falls apart. Kazuma, the main character contradicts himself and by the end of these 12 episodes he was not the same character at all. The love interest, is a cliche schoolgirl chick, with cliche hair, and a cliche bad attitude, and pretends to be angry with Kazuma all the time, even though she likes him.Typical anime chick. His little brother's a whiny pussy.Every thing about it is derivative. The story is just boring. I will say that the artwork and animation is great, but it doesn't help this series."
2,Alarm System Remote Control,"1.- Have good range2.- But: Battery installation is very very difficult3.- But: if the unit is hit, the battery loses contact with the terminals and the unit must be opened to accommodate the batteries4.- But: The buttons indicators are very simple hard to see and you must memorize the function of every one"
3,Works as descripted,"I've had this for several months now and it seems to work as described. I wish it could be a bit more compact because by the time you add it to your key ring with your vehicle FOB already on there, it becomes a bit bulky. No performance problems and works from outside the house well. I'd recommend as part of your system."
5,Easy to use and program,"Bought this transmitter along with the SC-10 package. Easy to program and use. You can find the 12 volt batteries when needed at Home Depot, Lowe's, Staples and Target and they cost about $1.50 each."
3,Replacement for the broken one,These remotes are not bad. But one of them broke all of sudden after 4 month of use.
3,Learn card games.,"I purchased this book for my wife, and she said it is alright, but she has seen better."
5,ONE PIECE,"This series is amazing. If you enjoyed watching the Dragonball series, I have a feeling you're going to nostalgia all over the place with the voice actors and get a big kick out of the story itself! :D"
3,Round out the collection,"Part 2 of the Walk On CD singles also has three tracks: Walk On, Big Girls Are Best, and Beautiful Day (Quincy & Sonance Remix). Big Girls Are Best is a fun, disposable song that's perfect for a b-side. While the remix of Beautiful Day was interesting at first, it quickly became repetitive and boring. The same beat is repeated over and over for almost eight minutes. But let's face it. You're not gonna buy this CD expecting the greatest music. You're gonna buy this CD to satisfy your curiosity and to add to your U2 collection."
4,Out of the Pond,"Great video shot in some beautiful locations. 50 minutes long. While it is beautiful, it is 50 minutes of wake boarding. That can become boring to some. But, I enjoyed it and was amazed by some of the things they did. Clearly, too much time on their hands."
3,Expected more,"HEy the dance moves are ok, but the beat is always the same for all different type of dance, whether is a cha-cha, pop, R&B;It lacks imagination! but ok for under 10 yrs old"
4,Pretty good!,"My almost-5 and almost-8 year old girls really like this game so far (we've been playing since Christmas almost a week ago). The game seems really well thought out; the character on the screen keeps beat with his feet even while the host-chick is talking, and the screen shows the character from the front and the back simultaneously which, once I explained this to my kids, helped out tremendously.The kids like it because it's kind of like the Dance Dance Revolution game they watch me play but without the complicated moves or needing to plug the mat in anywhere (the mat is just a guideline, rather than a scorekeeper) or anyone telling you you're doing the steps wrong. So, fun! :)"
4,excercise and entertainment,"My girls (5 and 8) really like this, and it's pretty darn funny to get mom and dad on the dance mat too!! Good way to get them moving in the grey winter days."
5,Perfect,"Is a perfect interactive game for children. Better than a Ipod.... you are in movement all the time using your body. You can enjoy it with other or alone. But really, you will enjoy it.Kamila"
4,Get off the couch,"My eleven year old loves this game and after practice is able to keep up. I have fun joining her, but am barely able to keep up with the 1/2 speed and just laugh when the animated lady tells us we'll now go full speed. It's great exercise and computerized enough to keep kids interested."
1,Very Dissapointing,"i had expected the game to teach you dance routines to music. It only does it to an annoying beat,and the routines are not all that entertaining. Even my little sister who is 7 years old thought the game boring and useless."
4,great alternative to ddr,"For kids/adults who never really liked how Dance Dance Revolution was all about the footwork but left out what you're suppose to do with the rest of your body. This game gives you the whole picture. The only critique my kids had was that the player was not judged on their dancing at all by the game. You're suppose to just judge yourself or if you have an audience, they are suppose to judge you."
4,The Best of AVI Records,"A very good sampling of some of AVI's overall work!My only problem: Although they clock in at over six minutes each, ""Le Pamplemousse/Le Spank: and ""El Coco/Cocomotion"" are ""single"" versions. Both songs originally clocked in at over 9-10 minutes, each! There was room on the disk for both songs in their entirety. So, this means an additional expenditure down the road at some point!My rating: 4 stars (I took one off for the ""single"" song versions!)"
3,Hit or miss ? On the border....,"There are a zillion funk and disco collection CD's these days and this one really comes in on the border. I was looking for legal copies of a couple of the songs on this CD and so it was (just) about worth the buy.For me the only tracks worth buying this for were Cocomotion and Mondo Disco by El Coco and Automatic Lover by Dee D. Jackson, which was the main track I was looking for. The rest I was hoping for better, but never got. If you remember the other tracks fondly then this CD is for you, otherwise you like me will be disappointed."
4,i've been crying out for this record!,"oh, this record has been longing to be in my collection of great tunes!i've got to dance (to keep from crying) by the destinations,a sad mellowdrama story with a beautiful melody to dance to or just play & listen to!!it's worth buying this just for this song alone, i play it alot!!i wish they would have made alot more great records like this, everyone should have this song in their collection of grand hits!j.h.52757"
3,Low budget family show.,"This is a great family T.V. show produced by Gene Autry's film company.It stars Dick Jones,a famous trick-rider,as the girl crazy Buffalo Bill Jr. who wants to be a hero but usually ends up as a punk kid who capture crooks.Great show."
3,"My thoughts on Selected Poetry, 1937- 1990","This volume of poetry includes many poems that do not make complete sense. The book is passionate, and from an interesting perspective. I would not recommend this book to many children, but some could handle it. For fluent spanish speakers, I would recommend this book to you. I think it would be interesting to read the spanish and english parts for the context may vary slightly."
1,below average,"This novel should not be listed as a self help book for those dealing with cancer. It barely touches on the author's experience with the illness, yet spends too much time exploring her little black book. But if you read between the lines you might get a glimpse of what a terminal illness can do to the human psyche. Using an online alias to trick her husband and tracking down married ex lovers were silent, desperate attempts to find worth. One can only assume this desperation stemmed from having such a horrible disease. However, if you want to learn about the many effects and treatment of cancer there are much more insightful books on the market."
1,Disappointing,"Books can be inspirational, entertaining or have some kind of point or purpose. This book has none of the above. ""Smirk in the Wind"" is about someone who has a serious illness, yet there is hardly anything in the book about the illness, the effects it had on the author or how they lived with it. So no inspiration. The book didn't teach me anything about the illness so there was no point or purpose. Almost all of the book is about an average individual's dating habits/ life, which is certainly not very entertaining. The book really boils down to the author blaming everyone else for what happened to them with out any self-discovery.In conclusion I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
5,An Update on the Author,"The author of this book, Kathleen Romine, died on March 3, 2003. Ironically, it was not the cancer that killed her, but the treatment. Though her body was weak toward the end, her mind and spirit were still strong and beautiful. She will be terribly missed by all that knew and loved her."
2,Alas! A Bore,"I am a devoted, loyal fan of Edith Layton. I have enjoyed many of her novels, but I have to agree with the previous readers, this novel was not worth my money. The hero was ""not to die for"" but instead stilted and hypocritical. The majority of the book was wasted on describing his courtship with the wrong woman! He continually fought his attraction to the heroine, causing us readers to lose all patience with him. The lovers did not come together until the book was almost at its conclusion. There was no sexual tension, no romance no true character development or evolvement. All in all, I would like my money back! Edith Layton is a wonderful writer, please do not judge her by this novel, rather, read her earlier books. The ""C"" novels are excellent!"
3,Flawed,"This is a fascinating book, but I was dismayed by Wilson's anti-Elizabeth bias. He refers to her as a ""hideous old woman"" responsible for the death of ""many worthy young people"" like Mary Queen of Scots and the Earl of Essex. Worthy young people...those two? Mary Stuart was singularly lacking in common sense, and, after catching Mary red-handed plotting against her numerous times, Elizabeth had little choice politically but to execute her. As for Essex, he was a spoiled egomaniac who bit the hand that fed him. Wilson also does himself no service by referring to Robert Cecil as ""the little secretary Cecil"" or by repeating without caveat a discredited story about how Essex's ring was not given to Elizabeth."
2,Lots of bones- not much meat,"This book is pretty much just an outline of neurology topics without much information/detail. It's not a book to ""read"" or even to prepare you, it might be useful as a book to identify areas you need to review. I didn't find it very useful for specialty board or in-service exam review."
3,Neurology for the Boards 3rd Edition,It was less explanatory than I thought. It is a TRUE review book which assumes you know all this massive material and just lists it out in a nice format.
2,"concise, but incomplete and sometimes inaccurate information","This book contains some high yield topics for the Neurology boards, but it is incomplete. There is a large number of important topics not included in this book. I am unable to find a great deal of difference between the two editions. Most disturbing is the number of mistakes that I have picked up by reviewing other texts as I was going through the book, some very obvious and not corrected in the second edition. This book is a good investment, but should not be the only reference used for studying for the boards."
4,Neurology for the boards,"There is a second edition of this book avilable in the market with some chapters revised and some new ones added, released in 2002.you don't take the risk of going to the boards inadequately prepared or with older information."
3,Student Handbook only...,"If you are a teacher thinking about buying this book, beware! Unless you are buying each student in your class their own handbook, this book is not necessary. The Teacher's edition has the entire student handbook already included. I purchased this book and it was entirely unnecessary since I had purchased the Teachers edition thinking I needed both for my class. It has helpful activities, but nothing entirely spectacular, and nothing I couldn't have found on the internet for free."
3,It was just OKAY,I found the layout to be a bit confusing. The information contained was just OKAY...a bit elementary.
5,A great book.,"An outstanding reference book for Tannu Tuva stamps. Not only did I buy one for myself, but I purchased several others for friends of mine who collect stamps. Books like these were not available when I collected stamps. Now, as a dealer, it is an invaluable reference tool; one which every collector should add to their library."
4,Quite an achievement!,"I'm not a philatelist, but I am a Tuva enthusiast, and I found this book most interesting and a a great addition to my library.Hats off to the people who have made this rare work available to the English-speaking world - it's a real gem."
4,Beautiful!,"The earrings are beautiful and detailed and a real value for the price. Considering that, you may want to check to make sure that all of the attachments (rings that connect each piece together) are secure. One of the earrings had a loose connection that required an easy adjustment."
2,Poor Script--Poor Show,"There are not many episodes of THE FUGITIVE that show minimal effort. THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLES is one of them. Nothing about Kimble, his case, the one-armed man, or Gerard is in evidence. What director Jud Taylor gives is another excuse to dump Kimble right in the middle of someone else's problem and see how he can set things right without getting recognized. The Disciples is a motorcycle gang that frees Kimble from custody only to antagonize the law. In return, the cyclists want him to break the law further by avenging the earlier killing of one of their own. The only point of interest is watching Bruce Dern act like the crazy he often was in tv dramas of the era."
3,A flawed effort...,"Lucilla Finch, the protagonist mentioned in the title of this unusual Collins' novel, is not one of his more endearing heroines. Oft times impetuous and fickle, even in her gentlest moments she's impossibly dull, even with the ""affliction"" of blindness. This is one of the many flaws in this rare Collins novel. The plot is mercilessly silly and wildly implausible. Collin's characters are mostly cardboard- with the exception of the narrator. Collins is not asking for reader's pity in Lucilla's plight for love in the sighted world, but pity for those who are bound to it's narrowed understanding. Not one of Collins' more accomplished works yet in many ways deeply thought provoking."
3,Burt goes native,"This is a true story about an American in the western Pacific who sets himself up as king of the island of Yap in the late 1800's. The book is very interesting and the movie is too although it is a 1950's Hollywood ""treatment"" of the story. Burt Lancaster is in his prime in this adventure film. He gets to show off his great physique, his acrobatic talents and of course his 1000 watt smile. The movie was actually filmed in Fiji and the scenery is beautiful. It made me smile to see how conservative our culture was in the 1950's: In the book, O'Keefe has nightly trysts with a native girl but in the movie Burt simply looks at her and smiles and then later you see her with one of his gold coins around her neck. Sex used to be much simpler."
4,Coconut Men and Moonheads! and a GERMAN in the South Pacific!,"Why would a German guy plant himself on the Island of Yap and teach one of the natives ENGLISH???This is a great movie because it's a time capsule of Fiji in 1953 with hints of the juicy machinations of trading in South East Asia. I loved the Hong Kong dentist bankrolling Burt's entrepreneurial vision and the snooty Indian traders declining to invest., The CREEPY Germans are of course, an important part of the story."
3,smart cycling by arnie baker,"i am a 62 year old living in southern spain where we cycle most of the year . this books contents are exellent ,the information given is well writen and to the point especially re heart monitor training ,i thouroughly reccomend this book for all age groups and abilities KEN BILLING S. Spain."
3,"Not for ""all levels"" after all","As a commuter trying to train for a century, I thought this book would be great. However, the part of the title ""for all levels"" is misleading. You must have a heart rate monitor, clipless pedals and an indoor trainer to even consider buying this book, as it focuses primarily on medium-to-high level bikers. It refers very frequently to racing season, has an infuriating section about training with weaker riders, specifically your girlfriend or wife, and says often that if you can't make such-and-such a goal, you're out of shape. This book is for YOU, the male, hard-core racer with seven days a week to train for cycling, but not for riders of ALL LEVELS."
4,Memory Rush,"It always makes me long for the simpler days of jelly shoes, parachute pants, and Duranies. A must have for anyone who can remember seeing the first video on MTv when it aired."
3,How do you build an 80s compilation?,"Like the other four entries in the Living in Oblivion series, this disc is pretty hit and miss. There are some great, now-lost tracks here, ones that I'm happy to have on disc again (Too Shy, Always Something There to Remind Me, Turning Japanse, Kis in America, 19, etc.). And then there are songs that I never heard in the 80s (and by around 1981 I was listening to a LOT of radio), and I don't think I was missing much.If I had my way, I'd try to condense the 5 CDs into 3 -- there are enough gems to fill three CDs easily, and about 2 CDs worth of songs that I would just as soon see slip back into oblivion."
2,"If you valued the 80's, buy a different compilation","You'd think that an 80's anthology of music would understand that it caters to an audience which is nostalgic toward that decade.I give this two stars only because you can't take away from the 80's music, but I figure that the inane commentary on the CD booklet should be calculated in this rating too. It was highly unnecessary and insulting to 80's fans to include disparaging remarks about the decade and banal political commentary by obvious leftist sympathizers."
3,What you missed on US radio,"Leans hard to the Europop sound of the 80s. BowWowWow, Classix Nouveaux - bands you didn't hear on US radio and won't hear about on Behind The Music. Shiny,Shiny doesn't turn up much on 80's stations, either. Enjoyable Ira Robbins editorial, too."
5,For the 80s new wave fan,"I remember all of these songs and love most of them! But, I am not looking for mainstream 80s stuff, a lot of the songs on the Living in Oblivion series were hits on MTV or in the postpunk/new wave clubs or college radio. Anyone who hit these types of clubs at the time should know these. A great collection for the true fan of new wave/club music."
3,Make sure your equipment is compatible,I didn't check this when I ordered the cable. I did it because it was cheap enough to give it a try and that my PC has an extra DVI out port. But something wasn't working right with the syncing that I don't understand.
3,This is Single-Channel. Only 18 pins,The technical data says this is 24 pins but it's not. It's 18 pins. That makes it single-channel.
4,Early Mel in good sound,"This is a great cd. The transcriptions from 1947 are the gems. The later 1950's ones are good too, but are more readily available on other collections in their entirety. So I'll limit my review to the 1947 transcriptions. With just a small jazz combo backing up Mel, these make for some of the most intimate Mel around. His version of I Cover The Waterfront is just marvelous. So tender and heartfelt. He sings it complete with the RARELY heard verse. Mel's wonderful voice just sound beautiful on these early cuts. If you love Mel, do yourself a favor and get this cd!"
2,Casual Fans Won't Like It,"Acoustics were good in this depressing comeback album from Huey. The ""hit"" track, ""Were Not Here..."" has weak lyrics, although Huey's voice and the horns are very good. The songs are generally downers. Huey's ""New Drug"" may need to be Prozac. Fans of the Eighties Hits - wait for Plan C."
1,Well past their prime,"As someone who grew up on the Rock 'n Roll of Huey Lewis and the News, it's quite disheartening to hear this once rocking band now turning out songs that my grandparents would listen to. The band seems to have mellowed in thier old age as proven by the fact that there isn't a single rock track on this album. It's a collection of ballads and slow songs that might as well be a completely different band than the excellent musicians that turned out such 80's anthems as The Heart of Rock 'N Roll, and The Power of Love. While there are some longtime fans that may appreciate the different direction the band took with this release, I'll stick with their older releases."
4,"Good, Solid CD","This CD is a good example of what good rock should sound like. It is not flashy, overproduced, or lacking substance. The guys do a good job of producing a good, solid work that does not rely on pop hits in order to make up for useless tracks. Even though I was barely born during this band's glory days, I still consider them to be a very good bar band, and there is nothing wrong with that!"
4,The 80's continue...Plan B works well,"This cd would fit in nicely with HL's 80's output of hits. Being that it is not the 80's (thank goodness) and that finding good music has become a full time job, this one has gone relatively unnoticed....which is a shame. This is solid HL jazzy, r & b pop that is timeless. 'We're not here for a long time', the cool version of Lowe/Edmunds 'When I write the book', the smooth duet of 'I'm not in love yet', 'Thank you #19' are all HL classics that could match anything on 'Sports' or his other great poppy tunes from the 80's. Relive the fun that oozes from these 'love gone sour' tunes and try Plan B."
5,the heart of rock and roll is still beating,"Ive been a fan of Huey Lewis and the News for the start, and ""Plan B"" has to be my favorite album after ""Sports"". The band sounds fresh, and playing great. This is good time, feel good music, the sort they are known and loved for. Nothing comes close to seeing them live, and I hope a Live album is planned."
4,Love It!,"This album is great! A little bluesier than their old stuff, but I can't stop playing it. The only reason I said 4 stars instead of 5 is that there doesn't seem to be any ""radio hits."" Definitely Huey Lewis sounding, but not like ""Power of Love,"" ""I Want a New Drug,"" etc."
5,WOW Well worth the wait,This is the best albums HLN has put out yet. My favorite is the Let her go and start over but all of the songs are great. If you like HLN this is a must have for you collection.
5,Plan B is successful,"Huey Lewis and the News took some time to create the masterpiece ""Plan B"". Starting out with ""We're not here for a long time.."" and throughout the CD, HLN rocks on like a fine wine that has been aged with experience and wisdom. This is by far the best work from HLN."
3,Something Different From 80's Stuff,"Thank God. Heuy is back! Huey Lewis and the News' latest effort is more like Huey solo than the band stuff that has beenrockin' like SPORTS and FORE, but it is enjoyable nice rhythm and blues one. Plan B the title is brilliant. Probably Huey want to do something different from 80's commercial pop style.Released from pressure to sell well during 80s he searches for what he really want to do. That's rhythm and blues good ol' rock and soul. Recommendable tracks include Thank You #19. When I Write The Book, Plan B. It may take some to sink in.Recommended for wide range of mainstream American music fans."
4,"Stupid, classic B",I bought for one of my sons who is a major movie buff and loves B movies.This fit the bill
5,A Great Cup Of Coffee,"This is a wonderful after dinner coffee, I was first introduced to it will in Gatlinburg TN at The Eight Gables Inn. This is as delicious in the morning as in evening."
5,Some of the Best!,"I, too, was skeptical about ordering this coffee, but the Amazon price was too good to not try it. What an excellent surprise! I normally buy whole bean, but the grind on this is perfect for use in my French Press coffee maker. Dark, smooth, no bitterness at all, and I make it strong."
2,"No way, no how","It's dark, bold, & rich alright, but doesn't taste nor smell like coffee at all to me. Will not buy again because of that. I actually prefer simple Folger's over this. Suppose it was worth a try because I'm a Jack Daniels fan, but it's not even made by them or in Tennessee, it's some company in Virginia. Take my advice, if you want better tasting coffee try Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, or Community Coffee."
4,Inspirational or Inflammatory?,"I was never a part of the debate over this controversial release.I just thought you could dance to it.And, I still do!"
5,Pure Music,"Enigma makes great New Age music. If you like pure music that doesn't have a lot of yelling or annoying songs this is the CD for you. All the songs flow perfectly together. Dim the lights, call your bf/gf/husband/wife over, light candles and don't forget to put this cd in."
5,the editor needs a to get a life.....,"First of all, the editor of this album needs to get a serious love life, and then he needs to get a bit of perspective on this whole notion of what is 'sacred' and 'personal'. All I can point out is that -> 4.5 out of 5 based on 134 customer reviews is not bad. The editor should consider reviewing other genres of music instead of offering his lack of enthusiasm for something he doesn't get in the first place."
5,A must for every music lover,"I Had the cassette of this title since 1991, date enigma released this first album. I bought yesterday the limited edition CD with 4 extra tracks that are worth having. Words are insufficient to describe this CD as the music contained in is very special. It transports you to heaven with soft music, well contained beats and gregorian chants that are a masterpiece. If there is a CD you must have, it is this one, whatever taste you like, it is THE ONE."
3,Not a Box Set,"This is not a box set. It's the original CD in a jewel case (with some of the original artwork removed) and a second, separate CD of the singles in a paper sleeve. There are no additional liner notes. Package wise, it's a disappointment. Of course, the music is classic. Buy their latest and pass on this package."
4,11 YEARS AFTER,"I had this album 10 years ago and got it once again. This was and still is one of the best from Enigma, would strongly recommend if you like this genre of music."
2,Good back in the day but...,"This album does not stand the test of time. You've heard the beat a million times, and although it's not their fault that gregorian chants have become overdone, that fact alone dooms the album. The sounds lack inspiration and the music sounds rather amateurish. What this album truly lacks is a sense of atmosphere - there's so much empty space in it that you feel like you're in the room with a drum machine and a tape deck.I have to admit that I loved this when it came out but there are much, much better options for downtempo listening these days (Thievery Corporation, Kruder & Dorfmeister, a lot of the new bossa nova-influenced tracks, Massive Attack). This album is the musical equivalent of Zubaz pants (OK that's unduly harsh but what's the 90s equivalent of a Members Only jacket?)"
2,okay,"I honestly thought this cd would be better. I was expecting this to be great, but I was very disappointed. This is not a very good Enigma cd. It is dull and monotonous. It's good at first, but it gets boring towards the end. Check out Enigma's other cd's. They are much better."
2,MCMXC A.D.,"I basically ordered the CD due to one song. Unfortunately, I do not like the others, which seems a waste of money. However, many others will most likely like this type of music."
2,very average,i heard all the hype about this disc and i checked it out.it's okay nothing ground breaking.sadness was alright but i didn't get what all the fuss was all about.
5,Excellent album,Do as the voice of enigma says - turn off the lights and relax .. and enjoy. It is an excellent album.
5,Fantastic mood music - relaxing,"I love this CD. I was unaware of Enigma's existence until last year when a friend introduced me to this CD. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it. The mixture of Gregorian chants and smooth, sensual beat hypnotized me and still does. I like all the songs on the CD, particularly ""Sadeness"", ""The Principles of Lust"", and ""Mea Culpa"". I've listened to the other CD's by Enigma and like them too, but this one is my favorite. This music soothes and relaxes me. It's great for meditation and is also a great mood setter for a romantic evening!"
5,Masterpiece #1,"I have had this CD for just over 10 years now and the fact that I still take it out and play it a few times a months speaks for itself. If I think back to the other CD's I bought around the same time, I guarantee I am not still listening to any of them or have since 1990. Enigma's (Michael Cretu) breakthrough CD is a masterful blend of complex chants, vocals, sounds, synthesizers and beats layered together to perfection. This music is Great for relaxation, driving or working to. You can listen to this CD hundreds of times and not get sick of it. Still Enigma 1 is his best work to date, but the others are worth a listen especially Enigma 3 and the latest release ""The Screen Behind the Mirror"" which are just a notch below."
2,Rip off.,"I'm a big fan of Enigma's. But for a two-CD set, one of which is a 10-year-old disc and the other is a re-mix of two of their tracks is a rip off!"
4,"MCMXC A.D. ""The Limited Edition""","MCMXC A.D. ""The Limited Edition"" being Enigma's debut album and their 1990 release is an album that brings back many memories for me. I remeber seeing the video Sadness on MTV back in my first year of going to Spyken. Here we get classic tracks such as ""Sadeness"", ""Principles of Lust"" and ""Mea Culpa"". The limited edition also includes 4 additional remixes not included on the original release. The artwork is quite nice and was done by H.P. Uertz. None of the lyrics are included. Allmusic gave this album a 4/5 in the review and I concur with this assessment. 4/5."
3,Strange but Good.,"I first heard this CD back in 1993 from a friend who brought it back from Czechoslovakia when he moved here, and I thought it was great. For 1993, it was hip, fun, and different from the trash and alternative music out there. I was a fan of Enya back then (still am), so Enigma's strange quasi-techno beats and rythms appealed to me. I bought MCMXC A.D. back in 2003 because I was looking for some relazing music, and 10 years hadn't changed my perception of the still strange rythms, sound effects, synthe pads, and ambiance.This won't appeal to everyone, but for those who are looking for a unique listening experience that blends dance, strange sound effects, techno, and some 90's hip-hop beats, check out MCMXC A.D."
5,Relaxing yet dancable,Enigma is an revolutionary band. They have combined dance music with well....praying. Dont get me wrong this is not a pure religours group. The music and voices are very relaxing and beutiful. Some songs are danceable.
2,Not so great,"I first have to say that I am a HUGE fan of dark, deep music. I bought this CD expecting that, Plus I love chants, and I was told that this CD was filled with them. I have to tell you, the closest thing to a chant in this, is religious wailing. It was a terrible dissapointment. I wasted [$$$]on this CD. Unless you are a hardcore fan of this band, DON'T GET IT!! I only gave it 2 stare, because it had a FEW good songs on it, and the instrumental parts were ok, but VERY repetative. I also have to say something else about the chants (if you like chants like me, you'll know what I mean), chants are ONLY good sounding if they are in LATIN, not French, like they are in this CD. I highly regret buying this. The only time I would buy this CD if it was on sale"
1,"If you can find sadeness (pt.1) as single, stay away....","With the exception of that song, this is truly the worst album which I have ever heard. And I've heard all of David Gray's albums. I bought this album on the strength of the undisputed classic sadeness, and turned it on to hear pathetic female exhortations for me to turn off the lights and 'meditate' which I studiously ignored. Then came the classic, followed by several samey, terrible songs. The album reaches its nadir with 'The principles of lust' which is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. The female 'singer' must be disposed of now.I bought this album expecting to hear the greatest work ever recorded, and am extremely disappointed.PS- An interesting story A friend of my brother was suspended from school for repeatedly chanting Sadeness (PT.1) at a teacher, who called it 'The Devil's song' PPSIt probably isn't. Enigma pretend to be devil worshippers but the reality is even more pathetic."
5,My favorite CD for all time,"The chants, the mood, the melody, the lusty vocals, the instruments...quite simply, this will be my favorite CD without a doubt for all time. The only other CD that comes close is Delerium's ""Karma."" ""MCMXC a.D."" blows the rest of techno releases away. It is the one perfect CD I have found..."
3,Repackaged singles,I am an Enigma collector and this 2 CD set is basically a release of the first album on disc one and a compilation of 2 single-CD's on the second disc. If you don't have those singles (they are hard to find) this is a good addition to your collection.
2,Dense and Unreadable,"Whatever the theory, one has to be able to communicate it. I found this book too dense and the prose stiff to enable a sustained read."
2,listen to willpower,"i love titd. this could have been their strongest work, but it sounds like such crap i just can't listen too it. very creative, but jesus... it's just so messy and noisy. hopefully their next effort will be better, and more concise. this album unfortunately will not make any new TITD fans."
1,god-awful,"they use that wind chimes thingy way too much, it's really fruity. the songs are over-long. the only song i really liked on this album was maggots and riots"
2,Get this only for the live tracks,"""Walk On"" is one of the highlights of 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', and this is merely a shortened version of that song. That said, there is no excuse for cutting off a song that was only 4:55 to begin with. So if you REALLY like the song, get 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'.The b-sides are live performances from the relatively small FarmClub venue (you can hear individual whistles and claps). ""Beautiful Day"" is nicely done and even more anthemic with its extended ending (e.g., Bono singing ""Go with soul!""). ""New York"" has a more dramatic guitar sound at the end than on the studio version, and Bono sings the refrain a bit more straightforward. (A MOMENT OF BITCHING: They really should have put a live version of ""Elevation"" on here, which is quite different from the studio version - especially their Saturday Night Live performance in December 2000.)"
3,Live from Farmclub,"This CD single doesn't contain songs you can't get anywhere else, but it does contain 'versions' of songs you can't get anywhere else. The tracks are: Walk On, Beautiful Day, and New York. The last two tracks are from U2's live performace for Farmclub.com and are worth the price of this CD single. Bono's vocals are passionate and electrifying on Beautiful Day, while New York is much more enjoyable here than on the album."
2,Too Indepth for My Purposes,The book was very thorough but was too indepth for my purposes at this point. I purchased a more appropriate introductory book and will likely return to The Vision of Buddhism after the introductory book.
4,A Gift,"This was a gift for someones father, finding anything by this artist took some doing, I guess he is considered by some, one of the Spanish oldie But Goodies--the person was surprised, liked it--end of story."
1,Bad Copy,This was obviously copied from a very old copy of the film or a well used VHS tape. Don't waste your money. The movie wasn't even that good.
2,Is this really acting?,I purchased this item thinking and hoping it would really tell the story of the battle. Instead this movie poorly portrayed the Italian army as a legimate military force.
1,"Poor quality, bad dubbing",Steer clear of this movie.It looks like it was made in someones garage. I was hoping I could get through it but had to stop watching after 10 minutes. Poor quality transfer.Looks like a very bad home movie!
3,Cheap and cheerful,"Well what can i say this is the first film ive seen which focus's on Italien troops for a change.It mainly focus's on an Italien company of soldiers who are fighting for survival during the battle of el alamien.The film is fairly cheap, half the tanks are obviously models n the others are Russian with an Iron cross put on them.It doesnt really stand up say to longest day or a bridge too far but is acurate to events.It watchable ill say that even though half the brits sound like they have got really bad colds and most of its dubbed."
2,"Good Movie, Bad VHS","This was a really good Italian war movie. However, the copy ... is currently offering from Congress Entertainment, is of low quality. It is from an unrestored, bad-looking negative and runs only 80 minutes, rather than the 105 release time and the 92 minute length advertised. It's hard to follow; some scenes are obviously removed. In one part Rommel is recalled to Berlin for a long rest, only to be seen in Africa 10 minutes later! It's not worth the ... price for something this bad. If a full-length restored print is ever released then GO BUY IT! Until then, ignore this print."
3,Low Budget film with rare historical accuracy,"Too bad the producers did this one on the cheap as it is more of a documentary in content in that it gives an accurate picture of the actual role of the Italian army in North Africa under Rommell's comand. Rommell and his Panzer Corp is shown in the proper dependent relationship to the much maligned Italian army in Libya where it gave a good account of itself despite being ill equipped and ill supplied by Il Duce. We are spared the unhistorical, distorted and biased accounts of battle always rendered by Hollywood."
1,The Battle of El Alamein,"The picture quality is very disappointing. Also, the movie was originally done in a foreign language then dubbed badly in English."
2,Low Budget War Film,"Pathetic and forgetable presentation of a major WWII event. The real problem with this film is its scope. The battle of El Alamein was a sprawling tank engagement across the North African desert, but this film involves itself with relatively miniscule vignets that in no way add up to the its name. This is an Italian production that, if you close your eyes and listen to the voices you would wonder if you were watching The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. A mish-mosh of multi-national nobodys portraying other multi-nationals unconvincingly led by the great Michael Rennie looking very unhealthy as General Montgomery. Tanks are British Comets and Crusaders painted as German vehicles. All in all a sappy attempt that will leave true war movie fans unsatisfied."
3,Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf: an autobiography,"Translated from the german by A. D. Coleridge - London - Richard Bentley & son, 1896. Hardcover, reprinted, anonymous edition (!).The autobiography of a key player musician and composer in the 18thcentury."
2,Sonically Inferior,"As I was downloading this box set, I happened upon a review that criticized the set for its sonic inferiority to other examples of the Beach Boys.Had I not already begun the download, I would have done a comparison between ENDLESS SUMMER and this set. Sad to say, I have done the comparison now and the box set is inferior in the extreme when it comes to sound quality. The digital processing of this release would NEVER pass muster with Brian Wilson--at least that's what one would think.It is fascinating to listen to the demo pieces and think of how certain works developed into icons of an era in pop music, but other than that this set is a disgrace to everyone involved in creating it. I feel cheated, and I had been thinking of this set for quite some time. Yes, I know, I should have done due diligence in reading the reviews. I thought I had.I would certainly rather amass a collection of five Beach Boys albums than purchase this set."
3,"Capitol, Help!! Please Put the Fidelity Back in This Box Set!!","The sound quality of this box set is extremely disappointing- Frank C.'s 1 star review is spot on. I really hoped he was wrong when I ordered this set, but sadly, he's right...Oh, well. You can easily tell the inferior quality of the recordings on this boxed set if you compare the same songs from the later remasters on 'Sounds of Summer' and 'Warmth of the Sun'. At the same time, this boxed set has some great 5 star musical content. So I'll give it 3-1/2 stars, since musical content trumps sound quality....I hope someday soon Capitol records will try to right the wrongs they have done to music lovers who paid for these very unmusical, sucked out recordings by putting the fidelity back into this boxed set..."
5,Absolutely essential,"This set gives a great overview of the legacy of the Beach Boys. Most every essential track is included. A definate plus is the Smile reconstruction. ""Heroes and Villains"" could have been edited, but I'm not complaining. Along the way is some of the most incredible music ever made. Those who want to hear the surf music of the early years won't be disappointed, but if that's ALL they know the Beach Boys for, they will be enlightened."
5,This is The Beach Boys collection to get.,"This is a fantastic box set. It has rare unreleased tracks(I cannot believe that ""Wonderful""was left unreleased for 23 years!),30 minutes of the unreleased ""Smile""album,sessions,live tracks,a book covering the BB's history,chart positions and 5 cds of wonderful songs that revealed so many good tracks that I had never heard before(such as 4th of July,can't wait too long,with me tonight,baby blue etc).A must buy."
2,SURPRISED AT THE LACK OF THE EARLY STUFF,"Back in college days, the collections ""Endless Summer"" and ""Spirit of America"" were essential. From the former collection, I really miss these on the box set: ""The Girls on the Beach,"" ""Let Him Run Wild,"" ""Girl, Don't Tell Me,"" and ""You're So Good to Me."" (Maybe the last one is not essential.)And from the latter collection, can you really do without: ""Break Away,"" ""Spirit of America,"" ""Hushabye,"" ""Graduation Day"" (especially if you're going to include ""Be True to Your School""), and their covers of ""Tell Me Why"" and ""Do You Wanna Dance.""Maybe single or double-disc collections of pre- and post- ""Pet Sounds"" classic tracks? Especially taking into consideration the reviews of the engineering and mixing job?"
3,To many garbage tracks taking the place of actual songs,"Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys [Box set]: This is a frustrating box set. The problem is mainly the fifth disk, which is a curiosity of interest to no one except the fanatical fans who want the useless radio promos and incomplete tracks. The Beach Boys are wonderful, but this box leaves me wanting more songs and less garbage. Even in the first four disks, when you are really enjoying the music, one of these oddities pops up to ruin the experience. This was an opportunity lost, and it is a real disappointment. I can only hope that a better box set comes along some day for those of us who enjoy the Beach Boys but who are not interested in buying every album just to get the good songs."
3,Beach Boy Gumbo,"All the songs are there and the sound quality is great...but the producer was obviously a youngster who neither grew up with nor appreciated the Beach Boys. The collection is a mumbled jumble of studio and live songs, back stage talk, interviews, demos, etc thrown together with no rhyme or reason and with no chronological sense. More like one of those TV specials with 40 hits jammed on one CD. For me it takes the joy out of listening to the CDs and I'm compelled to re-tape them in better order. A historical collection of such magnatude should have paid respect to the chronological order better to have digitally remastered each album and added the ""extras"" either at the end or on separate CD. Still, there are a lot of hits and memories for the money."
2,Too many lemons inbetween hits -- beware!,"Who can argue that the Beach Boys were great, and fun to listen to? I love the Beach Boys as much as the next guy. But not every single tune and alternate take and promo is worth its weight in gold. If what you want is every single bit of noise they ever made, then look no farther. If what you want is uninterrupted hours of great stuff, you better look elsewhere. There were far too many promos, alternate takes, and not-the-greatest tunes between the immediately recognizable ones. I had to keep reaching for the fast forward button to find tunes I was familiar with. I ended up throwing this set away and buying one of the greatest hits sets. Now I can sit back and enjoy."
4,Real good,"A good box set of Brian Wilson and the BB's. First half docments the rise of BW's songwriting and producing and is outstanding. Second half isn't nearly as good but still ok. It didn't help Brian Wilson turned into a ""Vegetable"" during 1967 after Pet Sounds was done. But still...buy this!"
3,too much good vibration,"This has all the songs you love...and lots of stuff you don't want. THIS IS ONLY A GOOD VALUE IF YOU BUY IT USED.If you are a casual fan I would better recommend ""sounds of summer"". If you are a die-hard-fan you might perfer Greatest hits Vol 1, 2 and 3 to this ""Good Vibrations"" boxed set. But basically it contains everything ""sounds of summer"" contains plus more obscure hits like 409, punchline, all summer long, in my room and wendy .BUT it has a lot of filler some of it gets monotnous and drags on forever. You have to dig through 4 discs of 25+ tracks each to find the songs you like.Even the die-hard-fans would have a hard time appreciating 4 versions of Heroes and Villains. Discs 1 and 2 have 90% of the good stuff. Discs 3 and 4 only have a couple of decent songs on each of them. Disc 5 is mostly a waste, it only has a couple of decent live performances. The rest is demos, instrus and radio spots that only work to annoy you."
2,You really don't need this box of rocks!,"I love the Beach Boys but,I may have not been more disappointed in a collection of music in my entire life. Even the k-tel offers you see late night on TV may be a better value. First of all, not all of the cd's even come in a plastic container. Secondly, over 50% of the songs if you want to call them that (some are short commercials and a variety of vocal and instrumental torture) I have never even heard before. There are 2 cd's with their hits spread here and there. I would say of the total number of tracks on all the cd's that about 30% are the songs you want to hear. The one cd with the most hits was not remastered very well if at all, very little bass and the one cd with some hits was decent. I would try to see if you could find the songs you really want by the Boys on individual cd's and it won't cost much more."
2,Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys (Box Set),"Unless your an avid Beach Boys fan don't waste your money on this collection. Several of these tracks are previously unreleased, theres a reason the record label didn't release them the first time around. Disc 5 is nothing more than recording sessions, radio promos and rehearsals. Save your money and buy the greatest hits CD, thats all you really want anyway."
3,Great Content Lousy Sound,"You would think that putting this together would be a labor of love and nothing but the best sound reproduction would be the result. Listen to the 3 CDs from (Best of vol 1, 2, 3) and compare the sound quality to the box songs. For this box a noise suppression was obviosly used and these lively songs sound dead. The content is excellent, but I couldn't be more disappointed with the sound. 3 stars only because of this. To think that someone actually thought this sounded good is amazing."
5,Bob Wills is still the King!,"I picked this disc up in a Wal- Mart in Chester,S.C. on the name recognition of Bob & A@TW. I was blown a then,now and every time I spin cd! I didn't notice the big country stars,except Willie Nelson. I quit listening to radio in the early 80's as that wasn't REAL COUNTRY MUSIC! This tribute explodes with the real deal. I love every song on it, especially the intro, Rolly Polly&Sad Party. Friends will ask if I've heard the latest NEW THING? To which I reply,""Bob Wills has over 60 songs and I've only heard about twenty of 'em! Who cares about the weak new stuff with these classics around! Shawn"
4,Columbia University Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation RES,Wonderful discussions on amputation...written with superb clarity. Would highly recommend to PM&R residents. This book is an excellent primer for PM&R residents before delving into Delisa and Braddom.
1,No excuse for all the errors,"This could be a valuable text with lots of practice questions. But any good qualities are totally overshadowed by its numerous errors. If you are forced to use this book for a class, be sure to find the errata listings on its associated web page early in the semester."
1,Worst book ever,"I have never seen as many mistakes in any other college level textbook in my life. The authors are so lazy, the end of section questions refer to tables and information which you have to flip backwards 50 or 75 pages to find the example they are referring to. The could not come up with new examples of what. Definitely use Bean's book which uses many real world examples to illustrated ideas. This book is awful."
2,There are so many mistakes...so many,There are quite a few unforgivable mistakes...They highlight one of the most important formulas on a page and the formula is WRONG... The answers at the end of the book are so wrong that will confuse you. The authers should proofread the book much more carefully.
1,Simply unacceptable number of errors!,"Countless number of errors in the text and homework problems. HOW THIS BOOK IS RESPECTED AS A TEXTBOOK IS BEYOND ME! Most college textbooks you would expect a couple of errors here and there, this book easily has HUNDREDS throughout! They even published a corrections list last year, but who knows if there are more errors! You have NO CONFIDENCE that anything you read in this book is accurate! I am so pissed off that the class I am taking now is using this useless excuse for a publication. My question: did they even hire an editor at all???BOYCOTT THIS BOOK!!!!"
3,"Good book, not so good church","Rich Nathan did a great job arguing for acceptance and loving those most churches reject. However when my friend and I attended his church we found it not so welcoming if you happen to be gay. I think they rotate pastors, we went twice and never got to hear Rich speak. I hope he can have more influance on those in his own church, I don't think they have read this book yet."
5,Book of the year,"As a former student of Mr.Deering i had to pick this up when i heard it was out. I honestly don't read to many novels in my spare time being a college student and not having to much time. But i made it a point to read this one! And it was Brilliant, one of the best stories i've read ever! As a reader i felt connected to Luke (main character) and felt as if i was on the voyage with him. The story reads very smoothly and takes the reader on the journey with luke with great literature thta helps create the image of exactly what the protagonist is going through, whether it be addiction, lust , love... Just a great first novel and i hope there are many more to come"
4,Eight Nights in Four Corners,"This novel was truly fun to read! One the surface, the main character, Luke, seems selfish and immature; however, Spencer Deering does an excellent job letting the reader gradually know more and more about why Luke is running from his problems. By the end of the novel I was connected with Luke because I knew him so well. Deering's descriptions are so vivid that I often forgot I was reading. I felt a part of the story!"
2,Poorlly made but pretty.,"I purchased this bracelet with the matching necklace. The necklace clasp arrived broken, and as the bracelet had the same type of clasp, I sent both of them back. Pretty, though."
2,Poor quality,This product looks cheap like it came out of a bubble gum machine. I've found better items at this price at TJ Msxx(no shipping charges). I truly love a bargain and thought I was getting a deal on this item. I would not recommend this item. The item did arrive quick.
5,Very Well Made and beautiful,Very well made and beautiful. reasonable shipping charges. Just as advertised. Exceeded expectations.
1,I received (Forge)ries,"I purchased these to replace some of the Hampton set I have but I don't know where these came from. They came in a box marked for another brand of flatware but the seller slipped a Hampton care sheet in with it. These are not the same item and they're all irregular, not the same length or size or the weight of my original set. They are cheap knock offs and I am not happy."
4,DISHWASHER RECOMMENDATION MISLEADING,"I had seen and used the soup spoons from this flatware set and liked the look and feel of this pattern. Even after much study and reading the cautionary reviews about rusting possibilities if washed in a dishwasher, I decided to order it. And, after it arrived and I read the ""fine print"" where the MANUFACTURER advised handwashing this flatware, I kept it because I like it and have committed to handwashing it. I don't think about it; I just do it because I wanted this flatware. It is too bad, though, that it hasn't been manufactured with the right combination of metals to allow satisfactory washing in the dishwasher."
3,Missing pieces,"Well, it wasn't even the same item. I ordered a Indianapolis Colts license plate that had the helmet with the word Colts written under it. What I recieved was a license plate with just a horse shoe. I still like it but thats not what I ordered. The package was also open and was missing the brackets and screws that were supposed to be included."
