3,An Average Wedding Planning Book,"Unfortunately, this isn't much different than most other wedding planning books. ""Look for this for flowers."" ""Look for this for invitations."" ""Here's budgeting advice you've heard before.""We intend to have less than 25 people at our wedding and I was looking for some creative ideas or stories. While the snapshots of real weddings were OK, it was a lot of same old white dress, same old cake... Since the small weddings I've been to have been NON-traditional, I was expecting more of that. Unfortunately, I didn't find what I expected."
3,Intimate Weddings: Planning a small wedding that fits you budget and style,"I thought it had many good ideas, although some were unrealistic."
3,Good for a start,"Friedrichsen's book is good to jump start ideas about having an interesting, frugal wedding. The best parts of her book are the profiles done of various couples, how they managed their small wedding, and how they broke down the budget. Especially well done are ideas that the couples used to save money.The book may not be good for in depth wedding planning, but perhaps no book is good for that. We have turned to Wedding Planning for Dummies, among others, to help us with the details of ceremonies, contracts, etc.If you're interested in a good introduction to frugal weddings, this is a good place to start."
3,"Works, but not well.","I have had these pots and pans for over a month now and I am not very happy about them anymore. All of the food sticks to these stainless steel pans, you cannot use a spray on them because that ""stains"" them. I have tried different cooking temps, using different oils, but nothing changes the fact they stick. I really had HIGH hopes for this product."
4,Great Quality Product,When this product arrived I was absolutely floored by the beauty and durability. The only drawbacks I've experienced are some discoloration inside my saucepan but that was because of the heat setting I put it on. I definetly recommend this set.
4,A great cookware start.,I got this set as a Christmas gift for my daughter who is setting up a kitchen for the first time. She is thrilled with it. I can't wait to go and watch her use it to fix dinner!
4,great set,"i love the set! it has all the pots i need. only issue is a bit of staining the first time i used it, but that doesn't take away the the functionality or appearance of the product"
5,Great product,"We absolutely love the set. Initially we were very sceptical of spending cash over brand names. We had Fabreware before and wanted to get a new kitchen set. Now that we are using Cuisinart, I don't think Faberware will enter our home again. Real good quality that cleans up really nice considering most of our cooking involves oil, spices, high temperatures"
2,This is not a good investment!,"The pots look nice, but that's it. First, one of the lids did not fit properly, and I had Amazon send a replacement (their customer service was great!). Then, I had the same experience as other reviewers with eggs sticking badly--this should not happen with good pots. Then, I found that they were very difficult to keep looking clean; the inside bottoms easily discolored and required use of a powdered scrub to clean--and it didn't always work. Finally--and this prompted be to call Amazon to get return labels send out right away--the bottom on the stock pot started to come away (about a half-inch gap) after the first use!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR POTS. POTS SHOULD NOT BE THIS FINICKY! But I will admit, they are nice to look at on the outside, and they boil water quickly. But in the grand scheme of cooking, these aren't tops on my list."
5,FROM BACK COVER,"'TIS THE SEASON...After learning to read and cipher (with the help of her dear friends at the Luminary Society) and saving up some money, Josie Turner is ready to start a new life. But when she ends up on the wrong side of the law through no fault of her own, she finds herself seeking comfort and protection with the sheriff! Lawman Mitch Hughes holds Josie's fate in his hands, yet it isn't long before his kind and gentle ways havecaptured her heart as well.....FOR WISHES TO COME TRUEFor years, honor kept Mitch from admitting how much he yearned for Josie. Even as a widow, she should be beyond his reach. She is more than his responsibility, she's his prisoner. To get them out of this fix, and see justice done in the process, they'll need a little faith, a lot of love... and a Christmas Miracle..."
5,Excellent Book - Best I've read on GMI,"Gary does an excellent job detailing the establishment of the school, the life of cadets on campus and their participation in the Civil War. He has an incredible amount of information on many of the cadets,their attendance at GMI and courageous actions during military action. Cradle of Glory truly brings to life young men who grew from ""seed corn"" to soldiers fighting for the southern cause. The book includes photos and detailed rosters of each year of the school and Caper's Battalion. If you love reading about the Civil War and GMI, you'll love this book. Great, Great Book."
2,"Spend a little more, get something better.","I bought this item instead of theLP Everything Rackbecause it's much cheaper. That's probably why you are considering it, too.Stop.Get the Everything Rack instead. This thing is awkward. The bars are too close together, which makes it only have half of the usable space of the Everything Rack. Plus, the Everything Rack is adjustable and allows you to position things off to the side.Seriously, the Everything Rack is better. Go spend the extra money on the better product."
1,"More on Can of Difluoroethane, not Air","After receiving this and discovering it to be Difluoroethane, not ""canned air"" as the Technical Description states, I've further discovered that while it can be shipped to me by Amazon using typical Amazon packing materials, I'm not allowed to return it for a refund with the same (or any) packing materials because it is ""flammable"".Not a good experience, part 2. I love Amazon, but this was unpleasant."
4,got to crevices in computer,"It worked well, though the first few sprays actually were a bit damp, but good product overall."
1,Paying for compressed air is a joke.,"I just bought a 1.5 HP shop-vac and the micro-cleaning kit today for $38. Unlimited ""air"", voila. I can't believe I ever paid $8 or more for a can of air that runs out after 1-2 computer cleanings."
2,An Oaf Abroad,"A more accurate title would have been ""An Oaf In Scotland"". His smug sense of superiority apparently made this sad man oblivious to the realization that he was being rude and patronizing much of the time. It is difficult to know who to pity more: the people he skewers with the wit of a turnip or the ones he actually LIKED. If your idea of a good travel companion is David Brent -- Ricky Gervais' character in BBC America's ""The Office"" -- you have found your man in McFadden."
4,overall excellent in identifying details,"This book is an excellant source book for someone who does not know alot about period details. I learned alot from the book and while I work with antiques everyday I do not see these types of items that often. The book focused on museum quality pieces, not things the common man would find in most antique shops. I would still recomend this book, it is beautifully put together, cohesive and a pleasure to read."
5,Excellent,"I had quite a lot of difficulty trying to buy this book as I live in Great Britain, but once I received it I found it to be excellent.It includes basic to advanced spreadsheets and is non computer software specific which is excellent as these exercises are adaptable for any software used. As an IT Lecturer I found the book to be an excellent asset to my teaching.My only problem is that I understand there is a Tutors Manual which accompanies the book, unfortunately I am unable to obtain this book and would like any suggestions on how and where to obtain it.Great Book! Excellent! In my opinion it is a shame that it is not easily obtainable."
1,are you kidding?,"i am not sure what to make of this. seems very self indulgent, pedestrian almost. won't be getting anymore plays in my house"
3,Tracking sounds,"Although its plodding nature is definitely aligned for background-intensive reciprocation, this little-explored release has enough allure falling through its simplistic cracks to warrant the Menomena moniker."
3,Quite an old recording,"This is quite an old recording of a great performance. Technology has improved in the interim. Also the enclosed libretto is not only in German, but old German (fraktur) and rather difficult to read."
5,Great movies,These three movies kept me hanging on to every scene. I watched all three in one night. Really enjoyable. Great plot
5,Nice heavier staple,"I know, I know. It's just a stapler. But if you use your stapler like crazy, you want one that works well, and this one fits the bill.It has a nice heavier weight to it, good grip, mostly metal construction with a rubber base. It opens up so you can use it for bulliten board stapling (or whatever). I have VERY rarely had it jam. I've liked this enough that I've replaced several other staplers in our office with this model."
5,Very good stapler,"This Stanley Bostich B220BK stapler is for work, and gets used a lot. I was a bit worried about the review that said it would not staple 20 pages, as per the specifications. Decided to take a chance. I am highly pleased with this stapler. Nice feel, well made. I have stapled 20 sheets with no problem - using normal 20 lb copy paper. When I want to staple larger amounts of paper, I use it as a desk stapler rather than holding it in my hand = no problem. I was happy with the performance and price - I bought another one for a co-worker."
2,eehh...,"i thought it seemed sturdy at first. a day later the rubber bottom fell off. it probably just came loose. just like the cheap staplers, it worked fine at first. then a few uses later, it won't go through a few sheets of receipt paper. the reviews on the swingline wasn't the greatest either but i guess i could've taken a chance on that brand instead...who knows..."
4,Excellent Stapler,"I love the old Bostitch staplers, and this one appears to be doing just fine. Many staplers like the Swingline do NOT handle multiple pages very well at all, despite most offices having them."
4,"Good stapler, does not come with staples","While it seems a bit ridiculous to not include staples with this product, the stapler itself works well. The advertised 20-page capacity is a bit overstated, as it seems to choke around 15-18 pages. 20 seems a bit beyond this staplers capacity. It is well made and I haven't had any issues with it seeming cheaply constructed."
3,First Gen S10 Owners....,Had to build an enclosure. Not going to complain about the sound for the price. These will not fit the factory location on first generation Chevy S10s. Don't buy them if that is your intention.
2,they work,these things are the equivalent to the old krako'sThey snap crackle pop more than rice crispy's. but you get what you pay 4 and they work
2,Some of it is okay,It seems like there is an over abundance of stories that go too far. Some of the stories are alright. I suppose the title should really be taken seriously.
1,Broke after 2 weeks,I bought a new long reach stapler because the spring on the old one became disconnected. The spring on the new one disconnected after two weeks! This is a solid metal stapler but the spring is weak.
5,"Sturdy, built well, performs flawlessly","I purchased this long-armed stapler to assemble booklets. Using standard staples, it worked flawlessly to assemble 10-page booklets (5 stacked pieces of paper to create 5.5X8.5 booklets). I believe it will last a lifetime and I believe it was a better choice than a saddle stapler for me. Definitely recommend."
2,Very Disappointed! Not the real soundtrack songs!,"The songs are great and so is Doris Day (and others) - BUT - do not buy this if you think you are buying the actual movie soundtracks. You will be very disappointed. For example, in Calamity Jane, the song ""It's Harry I'm Plannin' to Marry"" was sung with wonderful charm and personality by Allyn Ann McLerie in the movie -- but on the CD, it is sung by Doris Day, which is okay, but it's not what I was expecting.In ""Young at Heart,"" Doris Day sang - WITH Frank Sinatra - the song, ""You, My Love."" In the movie, it is really beautiful. On the CD - again, it is just Doris Day. Not the same feeling! Also, the movie version of ""One For My Baby"" is the BEST version of that song - but it is not on the CD. Frank Sinatra sings, but it's a faster, lighter version - not the beautiful, moody version you really want."
2,Another dissappointment!,"Looks good, but feels real cheap. The height adjustment lever broke on the first adjustment attempt. It was also very difficult to cut a straight line. This is the second skil that I have bought and I've returned both of them. I don't think there will be a third.Guess you get what you pay for. Not recommended!!"
3,"Great saw, but Skil needs to re-engineer their height adjust","I bought this saw January '04 and have used it only about 10 times. I loved it, but then the height adjustment lever broke (I think it's because the lever handle is plastic and it turns a metal nut, so something stripped inside). I took it back to Lowe's, who promptly lost it enroute to I-don't-know-where for returns.Great saw- when will Skil read this review and many others like it AND FIX THE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT? There must be 1000's of 5700's out there that have broken levers! Skil, where are you? You produce decent products- this one is ruining your reputation.Update: Lowes made good on the return, but only after I insisted and pressed the issue. Why you have to push companies to have good customer service is beyond me. Anyway, a Lowes manager-type finally let me pick a new Skil saw and I took it home. I works great. End of story."
3,Gets the job done,"This is the only circular saw I own. I have used better from friends, but recently purchased this saw to build a deck. It worked great, and never failed to make true cuts. The site light is overrated, but one can work around it and use it as a regular ol' circular saw. tough enough for average homeowner use. For pro's daily use...forget about it and spend the money for a pro tool."
3,Same complaints...,"Works fine, good price but.... Plastic lever on the height adjustment broke right away, and, I CAN""T GET IT BACK IN THE CASE! Good to see I'm not the only one!"
2,Fair saw as long as you dont use it,"I was excited about the sight light to help make accurate cuts. That is a good feature, but overall this saw isn't worth the money. The height adjustment broke the second time I adjusted it and now I'm stuck using it for plywood only. No more 2x4's for this saw. It does cut fairly well though and is comfortable to use. For a circular saw it is fairly accurate and easy to cut straight lines, but just don't adjust it or it will break. The case is also a joke. It does not fit in the case easily. My advice is to spend a few extra dollars and get a real saw from makita, dewalt, or porter-cable."
2,It's not full range,"These are not ""full range"" speakers, despite of the claim. I already have replaced them with something else, which ARE full range. I don't really recommend them other than a tweeter to upper mid-range use."
5,Car speakers,"Great product, sounds good, exact replacement. Very happy with my purchase. The sun is very hot in EL Paso, TX and it ate up the old speaker cones. But that is to be expected for a 30 year old car."
2,Disappointed,I had gotten one set and had to exchange for another because the speaker was cracking now the second set the tweeter is messed up but what can I expect for the price. Gonna get a set of Sony's or Pioneer's.
2,no bassheads...,"these speakers don't hav any bass response. i know they aren't subwoofers & didn't expect to be blown away, but one speaker failed under normal use. i never put the bass setting on my head unit to maximum b/c i was wait'g for an amp w/a crossover & subs 4that. oh well. may work for VERY low volume settings. other than that, don't wast Ur $$$. i bought sum 4x10s by PYLE & they work fine, GREAT to be honest."
4,Great singing but...,"Audra McDonald is a great singer and a wonderful person. She can make an art product out of worthless song that otherwise can only be used for ""empty driving"". Her personal investment makes diamonds out of coal. But there is inevitable question of whether it is worth it. Is it worth it to invest in dust? Not to say that all songs on this album where bad until Ms.McDonald inflated them with her passion, but how much higher she flies when she is helped by the genius of Nellie McKay. It looks like Ms.McDonald is afraid to apply herself to the works worthy of her genius. Let's hope that she will find the road in her next album."
3,Not bad,I can't say that I really like this CD. I bought it based on hearing one song. The rest were all kind of the same.
2,"I Love Audra McDonald's voice, but....","Some of these cuts are really bizzare and not very melodic. I would like to believe that only Audra could pull this off, but I am finding myself skipping many of them because they simply don't appeal to me. Too bad. Plus, I have seen her perform in person, and I just saw a New Year's performance of some of her work Live at Lincoln Center, and I was so turned off by her personal opinions I turned it off. I am not interested in hearing the personal opines of entertainers; that is not what I am paying for. I am paying to be entertained. Get off the soapbox Audra. I will not be purchasing anything else by this ""artist."""
3,Disappointing.,"Although I love Audra McDonald's voice and interpretation and acting ability, I'm disappointed by the choice of songs. From reading the other customer reviews, it seems that I'm out of step. I want to hear songs with melody; something you can hum afterwards. These songs are more like musical prose than musical poetry. Like the boring part between the arias, if you're not an opera lover. The singing is of course wonderful, but I wish she'd go back to the kind of music she had on Happy Songs."
2,"Um, no","There are certain singers, Ms. McDonald being one of them, that I've often said are so good that I'd pay to listen to them sing a phone book. Up until now, that claim wasn't ever tested. Let's back up a bit first. I love Ms. McDonald's voice. I first heard her sing an ingénue role in Lincoln Center. It was Carousel. She stole the show in my and a lot people's eyes. Ever since then, I've been mesmerized by her voice. I still am. But this album is a mess. It's well produced and arranged, but the song choice is bizarre. No I don't want to hear anyone, even Ms. McDonald, do a cover of the novelty song Bein' Green. Ms. McDonald's voice is a gift made for the musical theater. It is not made to sing the wonderful songs of Laura Nyro or Randy Newman. Lord knows other great singers have made clunkers of albums like this and returned to fine form with the next effort. I imagine the same thing will happen here."
4,A nice departure,"I truly admire Audra for constantly seeking new music to record. While this album is not my favorite Audra recording (Happy Songs wins that award :) it is still a very enjoyable record. Some of the tracks are sheer delight (""My Stupid Mouth"" and ""Wonderful You"") while others just don't appeal to me (""Tom Cat"" and ""I Think it's Going to Rain Today"") but that's to be expected whenever an artist is exploring new territory. I applaud Audra for her willingness to always seek new and varied music for her albums and will continue to be a big Audra fan!"
1,very lame,"this video was no where near as funny as its predecessor, ""Sing Yourself Silly."" The first one had excellent skits and amusing and catchy songs that you can sing with your kids for days. No catchy tunes here. Don't bother with this one, just buy the first."
4,It's really not that bad,My 3yr old really likes the silly songs on this DVD and that's all that matters. It is entertaining and worth a shot. He LOVES the chicken skit!
3,Sesame Street meets Ebert & Roepert... sorta,"While not the best compilation DVD of all, this Sesame Street video presents Oscar and another monster ""reviewing"" silly movies (rather, Sesame Street moments). Oscar plays bad cop (gives most skits ""Phoeys!"") and his reviewing partner plays good cop (gives most of them ""WOWs!""), and so they go through one and another skit, until it starts to get a bit old. However, it's not as much this that bothers me about it, but the fact that it's not even half as educational as many other Sesame Street videos. I got it from the library, and I am happy I did. I don't think I'd recommend this one too much."
1,I will not purchase heavy products on Amazon any more.,"I purchased this to replace my current rails. I also bought a Curt Q20 5th wheel hitch.The box this arrived in was open and one end was totally torn off and repaired with packaging tape. It did not have any of the bolts, washers, or lock nuts in the package. It also did not have the brackets to mount to the frame. I went to the local hardware store and purchased grade 8 hardware and used existing brackets. I wish I would have only bought the rails and not the kit. I went to the local hardware store and purchased grade 8 hardware and used existing brackets.Very disappointed."
3,Not what I had expected.,"I read the description and the reviews and looked at the picture and it was not what I expected. It is a solid piece of slate but the color was greenish instead of the gray and brown hues I expected. The lampshades were very pretty when the lamp was turned on with lines or speckles running through them. However, because of the color I returned them"
2,Slate Table Lamp,"Not satisfied with the way the shade sat on top, actually looked as if it didn't fit correctly, lamp was returned for refund."
3,Can't download photos,"The picture frame is a great concept but there seems to be no way to download from computer to picture frame. If anyone has ideas, please post them here. I tried for over an hour and couldn't get to work. If I can't get to work over the weekend, it's going back."
2,Not worth it,"I am returning my digital picutre frame. It freezes almost every time I try to upload pcitures and I can't believe how poor the quality is. I was't expecting plasma quality, but to be able to cleary see the picture is a necessary! Don't waste your time or money."
1,Potential Fire Hazard,"I loved the idea of being able to load images from just about any media.However when I turned the picture frame on - I had only downloaded 3 pictures when I heard a small ""pop"" - the screen when blank and smoke starting coming out of the back of the picture frame. Obviously something wasn't made right in this one. I had bougt three - one for me and two for gifts. They are all going back. I sure wouldn't want a present I have given to cause a fire in a love one's house later down the road."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I thought this product was completely unsatisfactory. The photo clarity was poor and the directions were useless. While I was downloading pictures, it froze twice and then the remote stopped working. It's going back tomorrow!"
4,Nice frame,"I found the image quality to be good. I think if you resize your pics to the frame's resolution (320x234 pixels) you get better image quality than loading larger images and making the frame do the resize.You can also fit WAY MORE than 100 pics if you do this. I bought this for my dad as an xmas present and am pre-loading it. So far I have over 400 loaded and based on the memory usage, I should be able to get over 1500 photos!! And this is using high quality jpgs.4 stars just because I think digital frames in general need to come down in price. And it would have been nice if the mp3s and photo slide show could play at the same time, but who really wants to use a frame as their stereo system anyway?"
4,Very Happy,"After purchasing this frame this past week and spending the time to go through years of digital pictures and using Microsoft Image Resizer to resize (800x600) the 395 pictures so far, I still have over 40mb left (you can store a lot picture internally).I am very pleased and definitely recommend this digital photo frame. The image quality was exactly what I expected for a device like this. It definitely is not ""plasma HD"" quality, but if I wanted that then I would expect to spend a lot of $Money$ for that.One of the great features this frame has is that it connects to your computer via your USB port so you just plug it into your PC and it acts just like another harddrive and you just drag and drop pictures to it.In short for the price and quality I was very pleased with the product.Hope this helps and enjoy..."
4,Great gift for the technophobe relative,"I bought this frame as a gift for my grandmother, along w/ 2 512 MB SD cards. Now I just send her a card and she replaces the one she is using, instant new photos of the great grand kids.Ease of use for my grandmother is why I chose this frame, however, I now also have one on my desk at my office and am being encouraged by my wife to get one for home (I'd consider the 8"" for home if the price drops some). While playing with the original frame, I did some comparisons of various picture sizes and found no difference in image quality between large (1600X1200) and small (640X480) images. As another reviewer said, you can pack a lot of pictures in 64MB (or 512 in my case) at smaller resolutions. I have utilized both the USB and memory card interfaces and have had no problems.Like another reviewer said, these are still to expensive for what they are, but the prices are dropping, maybe by Christmas I'll be buying cases of them as gifts. :)"
1,Terrible product,"Got it for Xmas and was excited after reading all the features.It works sporadically, very slow, and the resolution is terrible.I am returning it and getting a higher end frame."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FRAME!,"We bought this frame as a Christmas gift and preloaded it with pictures. Picture quality is VERY disappointing. Unless the person's face is prominent in the picture, it's hard to make out their features. Also, the slideshow keeps freezing. When we connected the USB cable to download a few more pictures (desperately trying to tinker with size to improve picture quality), we got an error that the device isn't working properly and can not be accessed. Now it is Christmas Eve, we are forced to return this junky frame and have no gift for Grandma. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY."
1,frame never worked....,"This frame is a waste of money. It would never work and locked up when I tried to load any pictures or memory cards. Dont waste your time with this one. With all the trouble I had with this frame, it was easier to just view the pics the old fashion way."
1,Terrible pictures,The pictures are grainy and blurry. The pictures I downloaded are from a digital camera. Do not purchase this product it was a big mistake.
2,Not very good,"You need three things if you're going to make this thing work; 1) Luck, and lots of it 2) Patience 3) Some knowledge of electronics and computers. This frame is not built well nor is it easy to use. Do your self a favor and spend a little extra on a better one."
1,This Frame is TOTAL JUNK!,"I would actually give this frame ZERO stars if Amazon would allow it. I purchased this product for my father back in August when the prices were at their absolute highest. Within weeks of purchasing it, the pictures on the slide show were no longer clear, weird lines starting appearing. Now, barely over three months later, not a single picture comes out clearly, all of them have black lines across them, this product is completely defective. And the best part is that customer service will not do a single thing to help because I am all of 10 days beyond my warranty. If you want to waste your money, and if you want the recipient of your gift to be incredibly disappointed, then buy this frame. Otherwise, I highly recommend going with any other company but Pandigital."
2,Bought it then Returned It,"I bought this due to some neat features like extra frames and internal memory but when i put is side by side with one that I got as a gift (Nu Vue 560) there was a big difference in picture quality. Tried to adjust the contrast, etc. but could not get it as good as the one I had."
1,Annoying,"I can get it to turn on, but I can't seem to get any pictures onto it. My computer won't recognize it / mount it, and it won't recognize the SD card I put in it. I don't see how I can use it at all."
3,A little flimsy,"I like the product. It does what it's supposed to do, but the darn thing has a tough time staying upright. The slightest bump of my desk or brush of the frame when I'm reaching for a folder sends it tumbling. I afraid that I'm going to break."
2,Not Completely Bad,"This is an unfortunate book. Based on reviews and the very interesting/ moving author bio I had big hopes for this one and it fell short. Middleton is clearly a gifted word-master; however, he fails to present a cohesive novel. The book is billed as both quality nature writing and literature, but in reality it exists in the undefined and, thus, unfortunate space between the two. That is, it falls short of, say, Rachel Carson's social portent, but also of the graceful emotive power of Maclean or Hemingway (both of whom also base novels around fly fishing, for whatever that is worth). Let it be said also that this book succumbs to the most consistent flaw of nature writing--it is often effusive. If you just want to read an account of the good ol' days in the rural south where life consisted of witticisms and outdoor activities, then go for it; otherwise, keep looking."
2,Enough Is Enough,"I picked up this book based on the reviews and would have to say that I was dissappointed. It's a essentially a character piece with the problem being that the writing is overdescriptive to the point of clumsiness. Middleton's style ends up bogging the book down, and with little in the way of plot, this proves disasterous. If you removed Middleton's descriptions of the color of clouds and the sky alone you'd shorten the book by twenty pages. Look for books by authors that practice a little more descriptive economy and don't write like a seventh grader trying desperately to stretch an anemic thought into a 1000 word essay."
5,Salvation in the Ozarks,"The first time I read this book, I kept it and sent the library the money. The second time I read it, I wrote my senior thesis comparing Middleton's home-style tale with William Wordsworth's nature poetry. The third time, I wrote Mr. Middleton to tell him about... well, just to tell him. Unknown to me, he had passed away the previous year. I don't know the circumstances, but I like to think that Harry passed away doing what The Earth is Enough shows he loved most, tempting the deep trout with a home-spun fly and the love of all things wild."
3,Sticky?,"The ball is nice but after a few uses I notice that the outside was a little sticky, which is very gross. It is also very sensitive so if you plan on cleaning with one of those gym spray and wipe, it roughens the texture of the ball."
2,Not the best quality,"This ball is quite small in comparison with other weighted fitness balls, and it is not fully filled so the plastic lining gets kind of wrinkly. This makes is difficult to use for certain exercises and also gives it an awkward hand-feel. It's not 100% round as pictured. Also, it has no ""give""."
2,tiny ball,I thought this was a much larger ball than it actually is. This ball is so small that you can hold it in and throw it from one hand without any problem. I was looking for a much larger ball and I do not believe that the ball has to weigh more to be larger. The image of the ball is deceptive. It's tiny.
2,Valeo Ball,I was dumb enought to think that it was a good sized ball. It is about the size of a yoga medicine ball.
5,Great traing aid,"I am a personal trainer and got this ball for personal reasons, and to use with my clients, as well. It is an ideal weight. My male clients complain that it is ""too light"", but change their tune after only a few minutes working with this ball. Both men and women will find it challenging during a workout routine. It can be used with most exercise videos, and can make routine exercises more effective."
3,"Valeo 6lb ""Fitness Ball""","I was expecting a medicine ball and this is not a medicine ball. It's pretty small but it does work well. It arrived fairly flat so I needed to get a pump to pump it up. If you're looking for a medicine ball, this is not the one!"
3,Not what I expected,"I guess I should be more careful when ordering!! I was expecting a medicine ball and received this little exercise ball and was surprised!! I did keep it and will probably use it, but make sure you are ordering the right item. This is a very small exercise ball. My hands barely fit all the way around it. My new medicine ball it on it's way!!"
4,Good quality,"As advertised. It comes deflated. I started to use it that way and it was ok. But, pump it up; works better."
4,Minor Problem,"This product is great and so far I had no problem with it all but I got a letter through the mail that said something about this product being recalled because if you inflate it too much it can explode and cause some injuries.Maybe they have fixed this problem now cause I got it awhile back.So other than that problem, this product is good.It is smaller than I'd imagine. (A little bigger than a baseball and smaller than a basketball.)"
4,Bmack,Very good product. Just the right size for our use during exercises. HS baseball team using these during our core exercise routine. Very affordable and recommend this as an inexpensive alternative to the larger med balls.
3,Cool looking book,"I have to say this book looks like a good read. However, the pages look like they have gotten a bit wet but its still readable. I cant wait to read this...to bad I have to wait tel the holidays :("
4,great book,This is a great book to help refresh your memory on trees or to teach your children about trees and leaves. It gives information about deciduous and evergreen trees and what types of leaves to find on them. It also gives a list of most common trees in the back along with pictures of what the leaves should look like.
1,Look close THIS IS ONLY A QUART,"What a rip off. Go try to figure out how much they are selling based on the ad. WELL GUESS WHAT, IT'S A QUART NOT A GALLION.POOR AD, POOR SUPPLIER. SHAME ON YA."
5,awesooooom!,I grew up with these books and now that I'm a first time auntie I jumped at the chance to buy these books for my sweet little nephew who will get to grow up with these books now!
5,Talking bread!,"This has the most memorable stories of the Richard Scarry books from my childhood. I remember looking at all the pictures in What do People Do All Day, and finding all my favorite characters in the very busy pictures, but the story I vividly remember is the the story of the Talking Bread, which is in this book (Favorite Storybook Ever). Lots of fun!"
5,Forever a keeper!,"My daughter has requested this book be read to her every night before bed, before naptime, and be present while she is eating and on the potty for at least the past month. Needless to say, she loves it.The stories are entertaining and fun to read and all the details make the book so special to young children. Lowly worm is such an unlikely but universally loved character, and he appears throughout the book.Some of the technology is pretty outdated though (ie hand canceling of letters, chloroform for anesthesia, etc), but the kids don't notice, so no big deal."
5,ANOTHER OVERLOOKED GEM !,"I think this is a pleasant listening experience with clean, clear, fresh, and joyful playing. At times, the playing almost sounds like period instruments are being used. Well worth consideration."
5,Groundbreaking Anthology of Los Angeles Poets,"Published in the 1980s, Poetry Loves Poetry is notable not only for its glimpse of many poets of national stature such as Charles Bukowski, Kate Braverman, Michael Lally, Wanda Coleman, Lewis MacAdams, Dennis Cooper, David Trinidad, Ron Koertge and Amy Gerstler at a crucial junction in their careers, but also because it belies the dismissal of Los Angeles poetry as provincial. Bill Mohr has documented in this substantial collection of 54 poets a literary sensibility that is brash, innovative, provocative and sly. As an added bonus, photographer Sheree Levin has created full-page portraits of each poet that give the reader an insight into what is going on behind the inscrutable gaze of the writer. Do I recommend this?? If you can find a copy of this book, BUY IT!!"
4,Sap remover needs elbow grease,"Family car was parked under pine tree and result was 20-30 ""droplets"" of pine sap all over hood and top. The product (which has a powerful chemical odor) did a fine job of dissolving these. You need to use the sponge (included) and apply the product liberally, almost soaking the spots first. But with elbow grease (ie lots of rubbing) they vanished with no apparent harm to finish. I did notice a light film of the tar spread around the stain so it was necessary to wipe down these areas with Windex to completly remove the tar and the residual tar/remover. But it worked fine and left no trace of the original problem."
2,contemporary Australian architecture,"Sean Godsell: WorksThe architect like his Australian contemporary Glenn Murcutt practices in the modality of a critical regionalism. The oeuvre of houses shows an architect concerned with the effects of the environment on human occupation, as his buildings are mostly formed by the skin of timbers used to manipulate light and air entering the facilities. This works are twofold giving even larger structures this almost chameleon aesthetic whilst still capturing and shading the effects of nature. Obtuse writing deters the intent of the book - becoming unnecessarily dense in conveying a simple aesthetic."
1,poor quality,What I wanted was a small stapler that would use mini-staples. What I got was a small stapler that uses regular staples. Unfortunately it is poorly made and takes a great deal of effort to 'staple'. It was cheap but in this case what you pay for is what you get. I would have sent it back but it wasn't worth the return postage. Don't buy it! I bought this through Amazon.Sandra Soons
1,There are not 9 staplers in this item. Only 1,"For the last day of my college class I was instructing I decided to give out a small stapler to each of the remaining students. Most of them had the hardest time turning in homework stapled together.I maxed out at a quantity of 10 of the same Swingline Tot staplers at $3.50 a piece (Swingline Tot Stapler with Built-in Staple Remover, Pre-packed with 1000 Swingline Standard Staples, Assorted Colors (S7079141S)) from Amazon and then found this deal. 9 staplers for about $9.00, I figured it must be a quantity discount. Well when the package arrived, it wasn't 9 staplers, it was 1. $9.00 for one stapler is not a deal.""9 each: Tot Stapler"" is the item description. If that doesn't mean you get 9 staplers, then what does it mean? There is a sticker attached to the back that does say the ""9 each"", Maybe I was paying the extra $5.50 for that sticker.Do I bother returning the one stapler for a refund?"
3,Only 1 stapler,"Based on the picture I was expecting 4 staplers. Rating is for the mismatched expectations. As far as I can tell the stapler looks solid, but I have not opened it yet."
2,"Got my moneys worth, if not less","I lost my stapler I use to have. I'm a college student with aloooooot of papers. And I like to try to stay organized, so this 3.99 stapler definitely seemed to do the job. Was pretty thrilled to get the stapler, It's a cute little look. Loaded the stapler and taped a sheet of about 4 pages, now it won't even close. The mechanism it uses to stay closed is extremely cheap and it hasn't closed since I got it. It's pretty unsettling, but I guess that's what I get for buying something cheap.Style: 3.5/5Effectiveness: 2/5-Sure, it staples, but it'll never close, staples come lose. Neat."
5,Handy Dandy Stapler,"I got stuck with an ugly olive green one :D but functionally it works great. We homeschool and I have a desk I use in our classroom and one in my office. I didn't want to have to buy a second expensive stapler for small jobs, so I thought I'd give this one a go.Works great. I've used it to staple up to 8 pieces of paper together. The built in staple remover in the back is great as well, it means I didn't have to buy a separate staple remover to keep in my office.This would be great for a high school or college student."
2,ehh Kind of gets the job done,"Don't get me wrong, I can still staple with it, but the part where you put the staples in does not stay closed. Kind of annoying, but it still staples. Yedigg?"
2,good item but too expensive to buy it online,"I bought it on line because I was so busy this quarter and not able to go to the Walmart or staple. However, when I went to the Walmart yesterday, I can't believe what I saw -- the original price of the exact same stapler is only $1.2!!!!"
1,Item is somewhat deffective,The Stapler won't stay closed .. I just opened it now and the stapler wont shut its seems cheeply made.
3,Possibly defective?,"So it works fine, overall, that's why I gave it three stars. But it does this weird thing where the top part springs up by itself, as if opening the staple-bed and that's kind of annoying -- maybe the spring is too strong for the this little plastic prop? Anyhow, like I said, it works fine and is a great size for carrying around in a bag if you're a stationery-junkie like me :)"
5,Stapler,This stapler works excellent. I think it says it will staple up to 7 papers....I think the most I tried was about 10--no problems at all.This listing also states that you will recieve one of several colors. It's the luck of the draw. I got black. The best thing about this mini stapler is that it uses regular size staples...you don't have to go hunting for mini staples. Which is probably another reason why it worked so well.
2,It doesn't work !,I purchased two of these...1 for my granddaughter and one for myself...neither worked at all....not like the old tot ones as I remember them. Yes it's cheap but you don't get something for nothing.
1,Broken,"This little stapler is a lemon, I used it less than a month and it died. It got stuck with every use and I found myself manually bending the staples often when it did work."
2,I received a different colour,Unfortunatlly I received a different colour. The image from Amazon is not matching with what they send me. And the head of the stapler is always opening out.
3,"Nice size, but jams easily","This cute little stapler came with a full box of staples. I keep it in a kitchen drawer for light stapling duty (receipts and the like).The problem I've had with using mine is that it seems to jam easily. The design is such that a misaligned staple clogs falls down and clog the exit, requiring it to be unloaded, dislodged (sometimes pried) and re-loaded.I've had this problem with cheapo staplers in the past, but never with a swingline. I guess for $4 I shouldn't expect a lot of performance though."
3,Suspension of belief,"I enjoyed the flick, but you have to have some suspension of belief to go along with the story line which wants you to believe it at face value. I like surrealism, but I have to admit it seemed a bit on the corny side. Nonetheless, I pulled for the main character so I must have been hooked..."
4,outstanding exposition of raga,"this is the newest mandolin srinivas cd on the market, and is produced by charsur digital workstation, a new outfit in chennai (india) that has taken carnatic music to an extremely high level of quality, both in terms of artistes they feature and the production of the cd. very pleasant to listen to this cd, and srinivas does not disappoint. i hope one day he will release additional albums on the real world label as well. ""rama sreerama"" is still the best srinivas cd i have ever heard. that's the only reason this cd gets 4 stars -- otherwise, it's excellent."
1,Mold gets worse not better! Don't buy it...ruins your documents,"When I first purchased this and opened the box the first time, there was a light damp smell. I thougth it might be my imagination. Ended up getting worse and I just noticed my documents are going moldy.I just read other reviews and see I'm not the only one. Ironic since this is waterproof from the outside."
1,BEWARE MILDEW DESTRUCTION!!!,"BEWARE!!!! Documents may be detroyed by MILDEW!!! After hearing of some friends who had stored past family pictures and documents in their safe box and finding them detroyed by mildew later, I checked one of my own that had been stored in by house for several months with nothing but the original ""silical gel"" pac and consumer documents inside. What I found made me glad I did not have anything valuable inside as the gel pac and consumer docs had mildew on them with dampness and the mildew smell!!! This was a FIRST ALERT model 2011F/2011EF. WATCH OUT!!!!"
1,Mold Problems,"As others have said, all my most important documents (many of which cannot be re-created) now have mold all over them. What a disaster! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you need to store anything that is susceptible to mold, like documents."
1,Lock stops working,"I've had this for about a year. Last week, I went to open it, and the key didn't work. I thought maybe the key had gotten bent or worn out or something, so I went to get my spare key that has never been used. That didn't work either. Apparently the lock just stopped working. I did finally get it open, but then still couldn't turn the lock to close it.And, yes, the mold was a problem for me too."
1,Mold issue,"Just got off the phone with First Alert and asked them WHY my birth certificate and passport are now wrecked by mold.They told me that this is a known issue, and the reason you get condensation in the box is because it's so air tight that the moisture that's naturally contained in your paper documents has no place to go, so it turns to mold.Not sure if I buy this or not, but they said that in their new instruction manuals it states in big letters that you should air this thing out once a month. Mine isn't one of the newer ones, actually it's one of the ""Honeywell"" models and I don't remember reading anything about having to air my box out. Kind of crappy.They did get my address and are going to be sending out those silica bags to me free of charge. I guess they come in a pack of 6 and you can just call them up whenever you need some more and they'll send them out no questions asked.So I guess the customer service side is pretty good for a product that's sub par at best."
4,A Little Clumsy,"All-in-all, this is a great little safe for document. We needed to get a dehumidifier, though, because after a few months everything inside was damp. We ended up withDry-Packswhich work great. It's a little clumsy to open/close sometimes, but since I don't open/close it very often, it's not that big of a deal."
4,Ok,I sort of wish I would have bought a safe that had a multimedia pocket so I could keep the picture DVD seperate from all my documents. This thing is really sturdy though. I'm glad I bought this brand because it seems really well made.
4,"Fast shipping, Good for storage","Very fast shipping. Bought this to store an heirloom book. The lock is not especially tough, but I bought it for the fire and water resistance. Also, hoping that leaving it unlocked will keep it from being stolen if someone sees it's only a book inside."
3,Fire/water-proof chest,"My rating is based on the fact that only a fire can test it's mettle.Having a molded plastic shell leaves conjecture of heat proof conditions.Waterproof ability without heat looks very good. The lock will only keep honest people honest. Construction is both solid and heavy. Size holds typing paper sheets unfolded with ease. I am pleased with the product, and hope not to have a fire which could produce 5 star resulting test result. Rating: untested 3 to ???"
1,Makes your stuff moldy,It makes what ever you put in it get moldy especially for some reason passports. I tried putting silica packets in it but that didn't help. What is the point of this if i cant keep my documents in it and shut it... Wouldn't recommend this.
1,Damp documents,I'm very angry about this product. I noticed all my documents were damp so I have to keep it propped open so they didn't get moldy. I guess I am more lucky than others that didn't catch it in time. This product should be discontinued and everyone's money refunded.
1,Damp and Mold formed on passport,"Read the reviews and just stay away from this box. I put lots of things in this box and months later, everything was damp. Mold actully formed on my passport. They should refund everyone who wasted their money. I'll never buy anything again from this company!"
1,Mold!,I bought the Honeywell 2037.I wish I had read reviews before I bought this piece of crap. MY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS ARE COVERED WITH MOLD!! Seems solution is to put those moisture absorbing packets inside. No thanks! It's going in the trash. I wish I had saved my receipt! Didn't buy from Amazon. DON'T BUY THIS!!!!
2,wet inside??,"Received the item fairly quickly, overpacked to protect the case. I too opened the chest and found the paper instructions inside damp. I was planning to store important docs in here but now i'm a bit wary. i purchased some reusable silica dessicant just in case, looks like i'll be needing it.it's hard to believe that much moisture is just from the air that gets trapped inside the chest upon closing."
2,Word to the wise: moldy documents!,"The inside of this box was damp on arrival, though I purchased it new. After letting it air out for a week before using it, I put my important documents in it. When I needed them again, after several months, they were all covered in brown mold! The mold stained several of my important pieces of paper, including my passport and birth certificate.Also, the locking unit may be made of plastic, which would not hold up in a fire of course. It could be, though, just the facade of the lock that is plastic. I can't say for sure, but keep it in mind.The mold/dampness issue alone warrants my low rating."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"As many other reviews have stated, this box has a problem with dampness. Within a few days of being in the box all my documents had gotten damp, and unsealed envelopes had gotten moist and sealed themselves. I tried adding additional desiccant packs, but that didn't help. I called Honeywell and they said they were aware of the problem and they recommended opening the box up and airing it out at least once a month, which just wasn't convenient for me. I had the box stored in a closet, which Honeywell said is known to increase the problem, but as it's a rather large box there aren't a lot of places it fits conveniently in my small apartment. I returned the box to Amazon. The inside storage space was sufficient, though the box itself is rather large. The lock mechanism seemed fine, but I don't think the box is built for high security - more for fire resistance."
3,good and bad news,"The box itself is strong and meets my goal of safety from fire. The lock looks flimsy, the keys look like part of a child's toy, the plastic looks like it could melt in a fire, leaving you with a solid and secure box, with no way of entry."
3,Heavy but will it stay closed in a fire?,"Received this safe today and it is heavy. I bought this safe to keep my valuables safe in event of a fire and water. I didn't buy it to keep them safe from thieves or the hands of intruders. But on close inspection, I've noticed that the latch to close it is plastic. So it made me think, will in stay shut in an event of a fire? Let's hope it doesn't get put to the test. Overall I'm keeping it (too damn heavy to return). Enough room in there to keep your valuables and 11x8 documents. I guess if you purchase safe it'll be put to test only once, let's hope it holds up as stated."
4,Great for the simple small stuff,"I got this to put simple documents in so they would be safe, it is just what I needed."
3,Good box,"The firesafe box is doing what it needs to do, short of lighting it on fire to test it, it keeps my important documents safe. If nothing else I have peace of mind.Update: Somehow moisture was able to get into the box and damage some of the items we were keeping ""safe"". Luckily we caught it before anything too damaging was done to our priceless items."
4,Great Alternative,"The Box is being used as an alternative to a Safety desposit box as I no longer need one.The box is large enough to house papers like car titles or homeowners papers, insurance policies etc. that you might need or some small valuables. I hope I never have to find out if the box really works or not ,but there is that small amount of security."
1,Terrible box - Turns everything moldy.,I put my money collection and other money in this box and it got mold on it. Called manufacturer and was told you have to air it out once a month as it gets everthing damp that you put in it. Even turned a paperclip rusty. I threw this box out. This product is terrible and will ruin everything you put in it so be ware.
1,mold!!!,"Same story!! put documents in about a year ago. checked for car title recently, opened up the safe and WHOA! the mold smell blew me away. one document cover was covered in brown, had to throw that away. wiped out box with clorex wipe, put everything back, but after coming across this site and its reviews, I've decided to throw the box to the curb. NO STARS. WILL RUIN YOUR IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS!!! (had to give one star or couldn't rant about this poor product)"
1,it doesn't work,"I just returned this safe to Amazon because when I tried to open it the first time, the entire locking assembly came out with the key.Amazon made it extremely easy to return by offering a UPS pickup option and then sent an email stating my account would be credited shortly."
4,Just what we needed,"Bought chest for interim ""safe deposit box"". Fits papers just right (note internal size...if storing folders will have to allow room for them to bend some). Chest was a little damp inside when we received it, which was stated in other reviews. So, we left it open with fan blowing on it for a few hours to let it completely dry out before putting things in chest. We also opted to leave the dessicant packet inside, just in case, and after a month we have had no issues with dampness inside the chest. Since this is a known issue, I do check on it from time to time, just to make sure there is no dampness inside. We hope this will never need to be tested regarding its fire and water resistance. So far, we are content with the purchase."
4,Honeywell 2017 Safe,"Very happy with this purchase - sturdy, very heavy and holds paperwork that makes me feel better should there be a fire. Won't know if it truly works unless it happens, but the peace of mind is there with this product."
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT,"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE AN OLD SENTRY PRODUCT THAT WASN'T WATERPROOF, AND IT WAS A GREAT DECISION. THE HONEYWELL IS LARGER AND THE SEAL CLOSES WITHOUT STRUGGLING. I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I WENT INTO STAPLES TO VIEW THE SIMILIAR SENTRY FIREPROOF/WATERPROOF SAFE, AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO CLOSE AND THERE WAS NO HANDLE, WHICH IS REALLY STUPID. THE HONEYWELL OUTSHINES THE SENTRY PRODUCT BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS, AND 8 1/2 X 11 DOCUMENTS FIT PERFECTLY. YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I LIVE IN NYC AND IT WAS DELIVERED 2 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE. $34.99 AND FREE SHIPPING IS LIKE STEALING SOMETHING FROM AMAZON.COM."
2,Dampness Inside,As another reviewer stated the inside was damp even with a bag of dessicant inside. So I question the waterproof feature of the item. Plus why was it damp inside anyway???Letting it dry out and getting some new dessicant to include with anything I place inside.
1,mold.,Two months later and everything in the safe is damp and mildewy. What is the point if anything put in here will be damaged by mold? Disgusting and frustrating.
3,quality on par with its low price,"This safe is very heavy and made of a super thick plastic material that if in a short fire probably will protect what's in inside, but likely would fuse the whole box together making it a big pain to open. Also, my box arrived with a musty mold scent with signs of mold growing, and the manuals inside were damp and cold, suggesting that it does not keep out humidity, so I would suggest loading it up with dessicant packets if you live in a humid climate. Given the low price I do plan on buying one more, and I hope I never to truly have to test it out. However, the way I see it is if you want true protection you store your valuables off site such as in a bank safety deposit box. Even much more expensive safes in this genre probably would succomb to any intense disaster so one can only hope for the best."
1,Don't be fooled!,This is for ONE pair of toe socks! No choice for color was given. Very deceptive picture. Amazon A-Z Guarantee had to refund my money as Amazing Socks would only refund purchase price. Got full refund from Amazon and Refused the package! What a rip off!
3,Helix - 'Breaking Loose' (Griffin),"Originally released in 1979,as this was actually Helix's debut record.News to me,that it wasn't '83's 'No Rest For The Wicked',as I've always previously thought.Hadn't listened to that much Helix in the last couple years,as that's as long as I've been on the internet.'Breaking Loose' is a decent effort by the long-running Canadian heavy rockers.Certainly not as good as their later material,but 'okay'.Tunes I sort of dug were ""I Could Never Leave"",the power rocker ""Down In The City"" and ""You're A Woman"".Might appeal to fans of Dokken,early Rainbow,Roth-era Van Halen and Ratt."
5,Defiantly a must have,"for people interested in drilling horizontal wells, you can do 2 things search for a lot of papers to read about them (waste your time with some useless papers ! yes there are some) or get a good collection made by AAPG in a nice book :D which i like to do, nevertheless reading papers of course is also required in this type of business, but if you like to have some good cases (papers collection) this book makes your life easy.they start with an introduction that talks about horizontal wells history and then goes deep to different cases."
4,It's Ok,"I did not think it was the greatest unit plan for a novel, but it did give me a few good ideas to do with my classes while we read the novel."
2,"Good quality, price, and looks but...",Bought these because of the color and the price. They look great and feel comfortable at first but I've had some of the same problems described by another reviewer. I have average size feet and I normally don't have problems with shoes I buy online so I'll guess that there's something wrong with the shoe itself. The sides are definitely too high at the ankles.It fits well up front but then it gets almost a full size bigger towards the heel and it's hard to keep the shoe on when walking fast. I tried wearing thicker socks and it was too tight in the toe area so I bought some insoles. They didn't help either. I really like this shoe so I haven't given up yet. I'll continue experimenting with other insoles. I'll post here if I find the right one.
5,interesting and thorough,"This book is very much needed in America today. There are so many misconceptions about Muslim women who wear hijab, and this book does a wonderful job of explaining the complex reasons why women choose to wear it. Of course there is opression going on in some areas of the world, but that doesn't mean that every Muslim women who covers is forced to! Bullock explains in great detail the politics, cultural relativism and individuality that is expressed in the veil without the bias of ethnocentrism. However, if you are not ready to accept that you cannot generalize about all Muslim women, this book is not for you."
2,Cheesy,Cheesy Lifetime Movie Feel To This BookI was curious about the Mormon lifestyle and culture after Warren Jeffs came to the attention of the media and public. I have read multiple books written by women and one man who have escaped the sometimes horrific lives they were born into. I accepted the amaturish writing style as part of the deal. This story did keep my interest but the quality of writing was mediocer at best and at point the storyline made me groan outloud. The main character Alli went through so many horrible things but I had a hard time liking her because she was so full of herself. w ith the boatload of baggage she carried every man that crossed her path fell in love with her. Give me a break. At least I didnt pay 9.99 for it. Read something else. I would recommend the 19th Wife if you want a good historical fiction read about pologomy.
3,"Expose' of patriarchal abuses, in the guise of a novel","Wives and Sisters is the fast-paced story of a young woman growing up in the Mormon church in Utah. Assaulted by a stranger, abused by her father, Alli decides early that God isn't as great as he's cracked up to be. What follows is 200-odd pages of death, rape, murder, stalking, tangled relationships, and most of all, a scathing indictment of the church and its patriarchal structures.This book isn't bad, though the author is so intent on showing the dark underbelly of Mormon life that she seems to include *only* negative elements in her story. Almost nothing good ever happens to any of these characters. Also, the book is maybe too fast-paced, with the author dashing off a few quick sentences to sum up whole years--years which could have been interesting to read about.Another, smaller gripe is that all of the characters' names seem to begin with C or K. It gets confusing. There are even a Cathy and a Kathy."
2,Movie of the Week......???,Wives and Sisters was an okay fast read . In one chapter Allie was telling Jake that this was not a movie of the week but in all actually to me this book was a movie of the week read I just finished this book yesterday and already I can't remember the characters names {I had to get the book from the back of my book shelf to remember }Although this book was intense I felt like it didn't answer any questions that the main character was asking though the whole book it left me wondering why I even read this book ...Oh yeah I had nothing else to read .... Written well and scared me to hell .... I now will hide from the Mormons when they come knocking on my door 2 stars is what I give this book nothing more nothing less
5,Impossible to put down,"I devoured this book in one evening. The story just grabs you from page one and doesn't let go until the story has played out.Allison is a character you can cheer for and care about. The things she not only endures but survives and grows from are hard to read, but at the same time so much like stories from headlines in the news.The story does a wonderful job of enlightening the reader about some Mormon beliefs and practices. While the action in Wives and Sisters depicts many injustices done in the name of faith, it is never heavy-handed or malicious in the telling.I cannot wait to read more of Ms. Collins' books, because Wives and Sisters was such a wonderful read."
4,Good Read,"This is the first book ever that I have bought on Amazon. I heard of the author through facebook, read the sample and had to order it! The book is good, it has you on the edge of your seat. I have spent up until 1 am reading this book, kept telling myself ""just one more chapter then ill go to bed"". I have bought another book of hers and I am reading it now. Great book!"
5,A Real Eye Opener!,"Once I started this book I could not put it down. It is so well written I could at times actually feel the emotions of the characters. It is always sad to read what man will justify doing in the name of ""God,"" when the only thing he has asked of us is to love one another."
5,one of a kind book,"This book captures you from the moment you pick it up. I couldn't put it down because it was that good. The story is told by a woman from the time she was a child.This book is fiction but I feel gives a great portrayal of what it is like to be born into a Mormon family. She feels out of place within her own family as far back as she can remember. She is Born with a strong will and she defies everything about the Mormon religion, and questions everything she is told. You get to know her family and read about her struggles. I look forward to more books from this unique author."
4,OK purchase,"Although the price is more expensive than eBay, I trust amazon's return policy more. I don't find any problem with this MS. overall satisfied."
3,Good product - ok price,Good product. Wish the price was lower. All's working fine so far so can't complain too much.
1,Baffling Waste of Time,"This movie was recommended to me, and I only finished watching it out of respect for the person who suggested it. The main characters had no redeeming traits, so far as I could tell, and the movie hopped jarringly from one event to another. Though I followed the subtitles fine, and could see potential for social commentary and developing themes, they never quite materialized. Chaotic, disturbing and well below my expectations, this is not a movie I will be passing along or watching again."
1,:(,"I alredy payed the item and I havent received it at home, its been too long... i may start to believe I already lost money purchasing this item...:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :("
3,Some suspenseful and exciting scenes + Based on a true story + Okay acting + They fought for the wrong cause,"- There are some suspenseful and exciting scenes. For example, the scene where the protest against the king of Iran became violent.- This is based on a true story. From what I've learned, this movie contains quite a few facts.- The acting is okay.- What annoyed me most is these young people fought for the wrong reason. They killed innocent people in the name of revolution against their government. As it's turned out today, 2012, we all know that, it's a wrong cause.In short, it's worth watching."
2,How is this DJ Shadow?,"I see barley any Shadow influence at all in this CD. This CD seems like a damn ""party mix"" more then anything. DJ Shadow's mixes are dark, moody, and have feeling. This is just beats - Which is nothing wrong with that, but saying this is better then Shadow or something along that line is totally incorrect. RJD2 and Shadow arn't even in the same playing field if you ask me.I would reccommend Shadow anyday over this guy. Simple as that.This CD is alright, 2 stars alright - Just a warning to the purchaser: this CD can dis-appoint you. Least it did for me."
1,YAWN,"i honestly can't remember the last time i was as disappointed with the purchase of a cd as i was when i purchased Rjd2's ""dead ringer"". having read numerous review, i figured this cd would be right up my alley. boy was i wrong. i'll just say this, when it comes to hip hop, i'm into artists like sage francis, atmosphere, blackalicious, eyedea & abilities, heiroglypics, del tha funky homosapien, jedi mind tricks etc etc etc. i was hoping this album would be on par with the artists mentioned above, but it's not even close.this album sounds like something you'd expect to hear playing at old navy. it's an attempt to take elements of hip hop and electronic music and make them accesible to the absolute lowest common denominator. think moby, or fatboy slim.basically, it's completely whack. move on. (anyone want to buy mine?)"
5,Wow. Better late than never noticing this classic record.,"This record is quite different than any music I'd gotten into before, and injected a feeling of respect for the genre that wasn't present before. Fantastic samples instill in the work an authentic retro feel. I think it's clear RJD2 has a lot of talent, and a great feel for music in general. Deadringer has a nice flow making me feel that the assembly of tracks was attended to with special care. Favorite tracks: The Horror, Smoke & Mirrors, Good Times Roll Pt 2, Ghostwriter, Chicken-Bone Circuit."
4,Nice,"Rjd2 is nice, but a number of his songs tend to follow a very similar run down chord progression, and there's the feeling that some of the songs didn't sound all that different in their original non-sampled form, more so on this album, less so on the following. (Which granted could be taken for masterful sample blending, but i think not.) Though, they're good songs. If i were to rate them on their production/sampling originality, i'd have to go 3 stars, but i'm going to rate them on their good songness factor."
4,Staples,These were the staples our other plant needed and it was easy to order them online and have them sent directly to them. They were also a good price.
4,Great fit for my Swingline Stapler,"I still don't know why my Swingline stapler did not come with staples but the extra pack (these) that I ordered arrived very quickly, packaging was fine as usual and the staples fit snuggly in the new stapler and they work just fine. There are quite a few (125!!) in there so I should not run out anytime soon. It's also in a nice little container that you can use later to save your memory cards or what have you."
4,solar lights,"I must say that the lights purchased have been very nice and accent the yard nicely. I would recommended to those looking for that little extra in their landscaping. Only downfall was that after two weeks the batteries in two lights needed to be changed as they don't hold the solar charge, otherwise great product and great price."
1,Beautiful lights ........ but they don't shine ~,"These lights look great ....... however, I am disappointed they they don't work !!! I have followed all the instructions properly and I am lucky if I can get one to stay on for more than 3 hours .... bad deal"
1,Where's the light,I'm somewhat disappointed in these solar lights. Th e illumination or charge is poor- The light dioesnt stay lit for long despite my putting new batteries in. What's up with that.
4,Not too shabby,"Good looking lights. Hopefully will hold up to the elements. The rechargeable batteries they run on could last a little longer; after a sunny day, they stay on for several hours at night, but after a cloudy day, not so much. All things considered, a decent deal."
5,Brilliant and sturdy,"I bought these for ""Mr. Picky"" who usually dislikes everything, but he was the one who suggested I write this review. These are wonderfully made solar lights and the price is unbelievable. We had checked other catalogs and found this price beats all. The brilliance of the light at night is almost as good as having a street light in front of your place. The neighbors are jealous! Well worth every penny, highly recommend these to anyone looking for solar lights that burn bright! Not difficult to assemble either but a bit unstable on the rods so they were placed in concrete on our brickway area. Burns 8 hours on a full charge."
4,Stainless steel solar light set,"Set is well made, strong and easy to install. Our only concern is that the lights do not last all through the night. We have been told that we may need new batteries and if they are not getting full sunshine during the day, then they can't charge fully. We have a lot of trees and shrubs around our yard so that is a problem. Over all I am very happy with them and would recommend them to any one."
3,So-so...not really happy,"Like the look, like the strength of the metal, but several never worked at all and others do not hold their charge. I am going to see about getting different batteries next season."
5,Buy the name brand,Buy the name brand. I tried some after market staples and they did not work well in the stapler and also did not go through the stack of paper like the stapler is made to do.
5,What do you say about staples - lol - nice and stapley,"Other than using these staples for our heavy duty stapler, we don't know quite what to say other than they appear to staple nicely and seem to be made nicely. LOL Little spendy, I thought, but I'm a value hunter and one small items the shipping cost is what kills you."
3,staples,"Unfortunately I mistakenly ordered the wrong size (my fault) They were too wide for my small stapler, but can use them in my regular stapler. Just can't find staples anywhere to fit the stapler I purchased."
5,Great CD!,"Rachel is a fantastic player of any genre! In fact, the entire line up is supreme. This CD embraces heavy metal with the virtuosity of classical musicians. The songs are expertly arranged and performed! Imagine Mozart meets Metallica! If you like your music adventurous, talent laden and stylish, then this CD is for you!"
5,Great Staples (not to be used for surgery),"These are great staples. However, they are not to be used for suturing wounds. Hold multiple pieces of paper together quite nicely."
5,Good staples.,"Surprisingly, these seem to jam less than bargain staples when attempting to staple a thick stack of paper.Use them with a good quality stapler likeSwingline 747 Black Classic Desk Stapler (S7074701R)."
2,"High price, low yield","I bought this book for my derm rotations, and I can't say the relatively high price is justified. It represents your typical blueprints book...very general info, nothing specific, leaves you wanting more. It fits in your coat pocket, but I can go days without pulling it out to use it. Some of the pictures are good, but there aren't nearly enough, with the vast majority of the conditions going pictureless.My advice is to pay a little more and purchase the baby Fitzpatrick's color atlas & synopsis of dermatology. It packs a greater punch, has as much (or more) information and way more conditions."
2,Keeps breaking,"I don't know if it's my stapler or these staples, but it keeps breaking when I staple. Then it leaves a sharp edge sticking out. I have a feeling these are staples that didn't pass QC. I don't know if I can return them since I already used/destroyed some. Anyhow, hopefully this helps you make your decision."
5,True artistry!!!!!,Have been a Karen Akers fan forever. Her unigue vibrato voice is like smooth silk! Just saw her live at the Algonquin Hotel and she is still PERFECT!!!!! This is a class act that rarely comes along!
4,KAren Akers,"I have long been a fan of Karen Akers after seeing her at the Filene Center in Vienna, VA. Although there is not much here of the French cabaret that enticed me to try this cd, I still enjoy it"
5,I love this toaster oven.,"After reading one positive and one negative review for this toaster oven i decided to buy it. The price was right and the retro style appealed to me. It is difficult to see the numbers and symbols on the toaster without reading glasses but once you know what they are no problem. The toaster oven works great, looks great in my kitchen and I am a happy camper."
4,Good basic product,"The oven portion of this product works much better than others I've had. The toaster is also good, but because there's so much interior space, toast takes longer than usual(and you set a timer, rather than a scale from ""light"" to ""dark""). The directions are badly written, and it took a while to realize that all three dials (including the timer) need to be on for it to work. It has a reasonably small base but it's fairly tall, which makes it appear larger than it is."
2,stylish,Don't waste your time on this unit. The color on the face is not the same as pictured. It's so dark a person has to have the site of an eagle to see the black markings and print on the face next to the dials. My unit has a loose handle that is laminated to the glass and can't be readjusted. The on light is so dim that it can't be seen in the light of day. The timer bell dosen't work when the unit is on and warm.The warranty is for 18 months and dosen't include accidental breakage of the cheap flimsy handle and large glass. It's made for looks more than any thing else!
4,Highly stylish,"EatMan 98 has incredible animation, a fun soundtrack, and pretty good stories. If you're expecting epic plotlines, you will be disappointed--each episode or group of episodes is a ""day in the life"" of the mercenary Bolt Crank, with no overall story arc. However, the standalones are quite good, and reveal a little bit more about Bolt's character each time. Ultimately, the series focusses on ""ain't Bolt cool?"" If you agree, you'll have fun--but if you don't, you'll be screaming about the tenth time he calmly walks in to save the day, accompanied by an appropriate theme."
2,Vague,"Eat-Man 98 is a vaguely interesting series. The show is made of short story arcs, ranging from mildly entertaining to downright ridiculous or boring. The animation is average and the music selection is nothing special. The only thing that kept me interested was Bolt Crank's character who remains a mystery till the end. His motivations were unclear which I found more intriguing than irritating. Bolt Crank could be a much more interesting character if the anime had better storylines and direction. Not recommended but worth a peek if you enjoy the strong silent characters."
4,EAT-MAN '98,"I've seen both EAT-MAN '97 and '98. '97 being my personal favorite. Anyway...The Eat-Man series is a very nice anime about a Mercenary (kills for money, Bolt Crank) who eats everything from a 9mm Pistol to an Out-of-this-world-huge-BEAM-gun... and after digesting it he makes it appear out of his right hand (this is the way he goes potty). Anyway, I like the series, its all kinda nice if you would like to see what the world would be like in a future or whatever."
3,umm...,"I haven't seen this film personally, but i think what the reviewer before me means is that the movie has access to the english language (english dubbed) only in the first two episodes. Therefore the rest of the episodes are in ""japanese"" If the film were dubbed into japanese that would mean the film were originally in english. But, since we're in the japanimation department, it would seem to me the original language is japanese."
5,"Clean, lush, delightful","There are some absoulutely amazing tracks on this collection. Up with people, At the River, ROYGBIV and We are all made of stars come to mind. Then there are many subtle moody tracks, especially on the second disc. All are wonderful. The tracks fit together nicely as pieces of a puzzle that depicts the lush soundscape of global music."
2,Not so Suitable,"I am always looking for a good read, and when I find a good author, known or unknown, I can't wait to share my findings with others.This book started off all right, but somewhere along the way it lost my interest, I'm sad to say. Pearl was too good to be true, Drake's character was ill-defined, and there needed to be better editing and proofing."
3,Could have been better,"This is the only book I have read by this author. The storyline was great, however,maybe a little unrealistic. I have to agree with another reviewer, the misspelled words toward the second half of the book were terrible and probably caused me to start losing interest. Editors did a bad job. I will try another read by Catherine Clements to see if its any better because I feel she has potential."
3,The Most Unsuitable Wife,"Enjoyed the book, was well written and I just wanted to finish it. Look forward to the rest of the series."
4,A pleasant read,"I enjoy Western romances and ""marriage of convenience"" stories. Ms Clemmons' A MOST UNSUITABLE WIFE combines the two and doesn't disappoint. Drake Kincaid needs to marry to secure his inheritance of his ranch and Pearl Parker needs to escape a town that is determined to destroy her family. The romance between the two is believable and the secondary characters, Pearl's half brother and sister are nicely drawn. There's a good balance between action and romance.Aside from some copy editing problems and typos toward the end of the book, I enjoyed A MOST UNSUITABLE WIFE and look forward to reading more stories from Ms Clemmons."
3,Fell apart at the end,"This is my first time to comment on a book, and I am a book a day kind of girl. I had to warn you about the last few chapters. They were so full of misspelled words and broken sentences that I had a very hard time finishing it. I've never had to decipher words in previous books. This one needed a proof reader badly! Overall, it was not a horrible book."
2,too much sex,There were too many sex scenes. They made me uncomfortable and I got tired of having to skip pages so many times.
5,Is she really an unsuitable wife?,It is a good story that I am reading for the second time. It relates well to the time period and has some good twists and turns. The relationship of the hero and heroine give the story plenty of interest. I would like to read more by this author.
4,The Most Unsuitable Wife,"A delightful read. Enjoyable, fast passed, and quick book. I found the material delightful, and enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
1,Not for anyone over 60... pounds that is.,"We have owned this now for about 2 years and we are looking for another bunk bed for our grandkids. The mechanism that turns the bottom bunk from a couch to a bed bends too easily. We have had to put supports under the bed so the back doesn't slip down in front of the bed supports. This is a very flimsy bed. Even the ""C"" support has sagged. If you are not going to put anyone over 60# (27kg) it will probably be fine, but 2 friends that weight on a single bed could cause problems."
4,An outstanding General,"General Bruce Cooper Clark met with us at our reunion in Knoxville, TN in 1974. Of course he had his book for sale and autographed it for all who purchased it. He was highly complimentary of the job that my unit the 275th AFABn did in defense of St. Vith. He was a graduate of the University of Tennessee. His book is very interesting and he says his armored tactics were designed for the Single wing Football formations that the University of TN made famous under General Neyland their long time football coach."
3,Tracing Italian Ancestors,Some of the pages in this book were so faded it was impossible to read. Some of the informationwas interesting. It would be difficult to trace your Ancestors using this book as a guide.
5,Excellent resource for researching your Italian ancestors!,"Find it is an excellent resource! I refer to it again and again!!Researching the names, Genotti, Buffarini, Garibaldi, Renzi, Cuccuini, Janatte........"
5,Great Research Guide,This book is very informative about the history of the immigrations of Italians. The how to read Italian records alone is worth the price of this book. I am going to suggest this book to my genealogy class.
4,"Charming compilation...My toddler adores it, and I enjoy singing along too!","My 18-month-old has never watched a Winnie the Pooh movie or read a Pooh picture book, but she still connected with the music on this CD and it has quickly became her favorite. She's constantly asking me to put on ""Pooh Bear"" and then she dances around the room laughing along to the music. And then I have the catchy tunes stuck in my head for the rest of the day...for better or worse. :)I echo what a previous reviewer said about there being songs aimed at an adult audience on here...they pop up about halfway through the album, and that's where it loses my daughter -- sounds like a light-rock radio station. But her interest perks back up when the kid-based music kicks in again."
4,Large & handy,This file is large and spacious. My 5-year brings home soooo much art work and this is a great way to organize it.
1,not durable,I like the size but it's not durable. The sides pull apart easily. I am looking for another brand for this year. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,Broke right away!,"A very good concept, but I don't know why they could not use a better material....my 6 year-old open it and it broke right away...seriously????"
4,Good Buy,I bought this in order top keep up with all my son's many projects and drawings that he brings home from school. Some things are just too precious to throw away and this works perfectly.
5,Great art portfolio!,This is a great art portfolio to store kids' favorite artwork in! The pockets are large and spacious. My daughter loves it!
4,Great Product!,"This is a wonderful way to keep art organized. I have one for each of my kids, and when they bring home art from school that is extra special I now have a place to file them."
4,Art folders,"These ""my art"" folders are for my grandchildren. Actually they are more for their moms who will now have a convenient place to store their children's artwork."
1,Received in rough shape,"I love that this gives me a place to store all of my children's artwork. My only complaint is that when I recevied these, they were bent and the back covers were ripply and the glue was no longer doing its job. I am disapointed I received these in this shape to begin with. I sure hope they last several years considering their condition."
3,ripped the backing to get a picture inside,My daughter received this 5 days ago. She likes this folder and she put some art inside. The problem is that the label in the area where her photograph is supposed to go was glued in there and I could not get it out with a tweezers. Anyways I asked my husband to get it out and he had to rip the photo holder a little to get the label out. I was able to put the 3.5 x 5 picture inside.
4,"Save the Art Work, Skip the Mess","I've struggled with how much of my children's art work we should save. We're limited on space and these expandable files are perfect for storing flat artwork throughout the year. We'll still need to pare down the collection at the end of the year, but it's helped us a great deal.The inside dividers are a bit flimsy, but the outside is extremely durable.We now have a system: bring the art work home from school, it gets some time on the fridge and then rotates into the file. Perfect!"
3,Great Idea- A Bit Flimsy,"I was really happy to finally have a place to put all of my daughter's projects. The concept of the Art Storage Case is a great one with accordian files inside for separating work into months, years, types. However, my daughter, being eager to ""review"" her work picked it up on her own and opened the whole case with a bit too much zest. The side has already ripped. It is only a thick paper for the accordian sides so I am not suprised. It will do for now but I am on the lookout for something more durable."
2,Schoolwork Storage Keeper,"This is a great place to store the kids artwork and/or school papers for each grade. I have my children choose which school papers they value most at the end of the year and we put it inside labeled per grade.Unfortunately, there aren't enough pockets for each grade so you will have to double up.My only complaint is that although the pockets expand to a good enough size, once it gets to a certain point, the front cardboard piece starts to peel away from the pockets and thus it is no longer together."
4,Keeps the art projects organized,Art portfolio keeps my 5yr olds art projects flat and organized. Makes it easy to take her latest creations on the road to show the grandparents...she is like a travling artist! lol
5,great music,great c.d. extremely good quality. I would highly recommend this company for quality and prompt delivery.
5,Badly Underatted,"This CD does not have the singles such as Rikki Don't Lose That Number and Peg that other Steely Dan releases have. However, it has many snappy jazz/rock numbers that will get you to say,""This is primo stuff."" Black Friday rocks with abandon while Chain Lightning as a cool bluesy feel. The second part to Your Gold Teeth has a nice change of rhythm from the first edition on Countdown To Ecstasy. This is not putting down the other version in anyway. The other songs are all well constructed and make this high quality material that really should have gotten more notice."
4,Steel Dan II:Katy Lied on Black Friday,"Katy Lied marked phase two in the Steely Dan epic. Recorded around a transitional lineup that included Mike McDonald and Jeff Porcaro Katy Lied also marked the emergence of Donald Fagen as one of the leading vocalists in the rock world. Now only a part time keyboard player (getting major help on this lp from Vic Feldman and Michael Omartian) Fagen jumps full force into the 'Katy Lied' project with vim and vigor. Katy Lied also marks the emergence of Walter Becker as a prominent lead guitarist and includes stellar contributions from Denny Dias, Rick Derringer and jazz great Phil Woods, whose haunting solo on 'Doctor Wu' ranks among the great moments in 'Dan history. Again the CD remastering is suberb and brings to light much of the audio skullduggery undertaken by engineer Nichols and producer Katz.....'Katy Lied'...a tour de force! Steve O'Rourke stevev@jps.net END"
2,Some Of His Songs On His CD,Are not very good. It is too bad because many of his songs are very good and not on his CD.
5,A staple remover,"If you need to remove staples from your paper, it doesn't get anymore classic than this staple remover. I've been using these things since forever, and they've never failed to remove a staple when I needed it gone."
3,Uncomfortable Grip,"This is not the staple remover I'm used to. It has large wings that are supposedly there to make it easier to hold, but those large wings are sharp and have odd ridges on them. This makes the staple remover feel uncomfortable in your hands. Luckily I don't have to use this more than once or twice a day so it's not really worth returning, but still I am not a big fan of this item."
3,"good, but not great","This book presents a good overview of many philosophers and their big ideas, along with repetitive and simplified assertions of how those ideas have been manifested in today's society. After reading this book, I better understand the philosophical ideas, but I don't think I know any better how to refute them. While this book was enjoyable and entertaining, I got a lot more out of Sproul's _The_Consequences_of_Ideas_."
5,Swingline,"Received in timely manner, undamaged and works as advertised, Swingline S.F. 13 HeavyDuty Staples 25 sheet capacity and does not get stuck in my Swingline stapler."
2,Good show- not so good sound,"This is a great show, but I am stumped by how bad the sound is on the CD. First of all, turn down the treble on your stereo before you turn up the volume on the CD. This CD is very ""crispy"" with a whole lot of high-hat to listen to and not enough warmth. The percussion sound leaves a bit to be desired as well. I have been seeing and listening to moe. since '96 and have way better sounding tapes and CD's of live shows than this one. In my opinion, moe. can do away with the audience microphone mix and just stick to the soundboard, or turn down the levels on the mics in the mix. Volume 2 is a bit better, but for The Tabernacle in Atlanta, it is way below par (judging by what I have heard released by other bands at this same venue).The show in Volume 1 is stellar, but if you want great sound, you won't find it here."
3,real moe.rons hate the mix,"Hey everybody out there! These Warts and all discs are good live music, but they are NOTHING like the real thing. Final edits left out witty bantor, crowd sounds, and the true moe. experience. I've seen moe. over sixty times and these discs leave much to be desired. In the last 4 years I've caught three new years shows and I haven't missed a moe.lloween since the Dark Side Experiment. If you want to hear live moe, TRADE TAPES! The band would rather see bootlegs than get their 3% kickback from album sales. I'll see you at the next moe.show!"
2,Not worth the price,"I have beeb buying Vaneli shoes for years, but I was disappointed in the quality of this pair. They look well-worn after only two months of occasional wear. I was also disappointed that the price was cut only one week after my purchase. The style is cute, though, and they are one of the only flat mules in this style in the list. More flat, dressy mules, need to be added. The black mules with the palm trees are the only others and they are outrageouly priced!"
2,Aborted the purchase--not as described.,"I accepted an offer of the Pentagon Papers, a four volume set written by the Defense Dept. and published in 1971. The offer stated ""four volumes"". I had earlier purchased the above title from Amazon only to receive one volume, so I contacted the seller to insure this offer was for FOUR volumes. Seller said ""oops-it is only one volume"",. so I canceled the order. It appears that sellers do not really look at the wording of their offers, and Amazon does not check them. Oder at your peril."
3,A pleasant listen,"I found ""Auld Lang Syne: The Millenium Mix"" the most interesting track on this CD. Listening to it truly gave me an appreciation for the sounds that tape recording has captured over a century, and how those sounds--our collective voice as a society--have changed over each decade. He captures well the sounds of the century, so that you get a distinct feel for each decade's personal voice. I enjoyed listening to this particular track as 1999 drew to a close.The rest of the tracks, however, I found merely pleasant to listen to, and nothing distinctive about them. This is comforting, reflective music, good to listen to on a cold day at the end of the year with a fire in the fireplace."
1,"No Faith in ""Faith""","I really do love Kenny G's music. I adored ""Miracles"" and it's part of every Christmas holiday. But the new ""Faith"" leaves me in the cold. Too ""cutesy"" and the ""Millenial Auld Lang Syne"" is nothing short of annoying. Hope the next millenial holiday album he does improves! Seasons Greetings!"
2,Same old same old,"Kenny is a very polished musician but this is very boring, lets have more original stuff Please."
4,Amazing Holiday Relaxing Music,"This is one of the most amazing, relaxing,exciting,holiday music cd's I have heard in quite some time. It will be a pleasure for the listening ears of music fans,it is a must buy for the last year in this century as we embark on a new millenium"
4,A 5-star without the Auld-Lang Syne millenial piece,"A throughly enjoyable album that is a nice backdrop to the Christmas festivities in our home. However, I really do not like the 100 years of news headlines in the Auld-Lange Syne millenial piece at the end of the CD. While I appreciate the imagery as an artistic creation, I do not believe that this is the right album to have put it on. I do not want to remember so many of the tragic moments of the last 100 years such as the assasination of JFK, the Challenger blowing up, the announcement that a nuclear bomb has just been dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, etc., in the middle of a Christmas dinner party or a fun family gathering."
1,Seriously Disappointed and OUTRAGED,"This album reminds me of a train wreck. The sweet sounds of Kenny G are followed by an enormous trauma known as a ""millenium mix"". This is a serious disappointment. That track should not have been on this album, and has spoiled the entire CD for me. The mix was a negative, biased, and inaccurate snapshot of our century. I will not be keeping this CD and will carefully screen any new Kenny G album in the future. For a similar experience, eat a chocolate truffle and then have a refreshing glass of vinegar!"
1,I knew it was too good to be true,"I tried to listen to this album. I really did. Holiday songs, how could you mess up Christmas songs. Ask Kenny G, he's an expert at that sort of thing. As I expected,his tone was very, very dry and monotoneous. The ear peircing sound he creates from his soprano is incredibly hollow. And I am completely serious when I say that he plays out of tune. I play saxophone myself, so I do know what Im talking about. If you want to hear someone play holiday songs on saxophone or any other instrument go to the nearest middle school and watch the beginning band members play their christmas concert. They'll be more in tune than Gorelick will ever be."
1,Too Much Horn,"I was very surprised to hear so much saxophone. With a name like ""g"" one would expect industrial rock at a minimum. Obviously this buffoon is capitalizing on associated noteriety. long live bands with real talent like Ramstein"
2,"Not As Bad As Michael Bolton's ""Timeless""!","At least with seasonal CDs, they usually disappear from the racks sometime after Christmas. It would test anyone's faith to have to endure this music at Christmas parties. The best part about this CD is that it represents one less CD that Kenny G has to make on his current contract."
5,received wrong cd,"I ordered ""FAITH"". But I never received it. They sent ""MIRACLES"" by mistake. Now I have two Miracles. I'm done with Amazon.John"
5,A CHRISTMAS CHEER,IT IS A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS CD WITH A BUNCH OF HAPPINESS AND CHEER.THE SONGS AREWELL PLAYED BY OUT BY KENNY G.HE SURE PLAYS A EXCELLENT SAXOPHONE.
5,He did it again,"This album arrived two days before Christmas 2001. It has classic songs on it especially the hidden tracks ""Auld Lang Syne"" and ""The Christmas Song."" Kenny G has Christmas in his name and especially if you like saxophone jazz music, this is a must to own."
2,People like this stuff?,"ive been playing sax for 5 or 6 yrs and have tried to play along with his cd's. most of his pieces are written in easy keys. he just takes old favorites and jazzes them up. if u really like true sax music instead of kenny g junk, try listening to the glazunov concerto or creston sonata, or maybe milhaud's scaramouche or maurice's tableaux de provence."
5,Awesome,I love this CD! I love all of Kenny G's stuff but this one really takes the cake. The millennium mix has me laughing at one moment and only seconds later moves me to tears. What an awesome idea to mix both history and beautiful music together!
2,Not up to the Key of G,"Have been a great fan of Kenny G so rushed out to get his new holiday album..The arrangments for this album are not up to par with any of Kenny's work. The voices in the New Year piece are inappropriate for this album and everytime I play it, my dogs bark thinking there is someone in the house. Kennys past work is good, but this is not the soft music that was so good in his first holiday album..Wish I had not bought it.."
1,somebody actually bought this?,"I caught Kenny No-last-name's rendition of ""Auld Lang Syne"" on the radio last week. At first I thought I was hearing a kazoo, then I thought, ""bagpipes?"". Bagpipes would be appropriate, but bagpipes aren't nearly so thin and grating. The thing that really annoyed me, though, was that he kept playing the melody over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and..."
5,,"Kenny G. is phenomenal in his playing of the saxophone as well as the composing of the music. This is perhaps the best, most beautiful and most relaxing CD in my collection, along with his other holiday CDs. If there is one track on this disc that blew me away, it is The Millenium Mix of Auld Lang Syne. This is brilliantly and masterfully composed and performed - absolutely beautiful! In every way. Yes, I too, was wiping away quite a few tears while listening to this moving and powerful piece. It is unlike anything else I've heard. The plain, regular version is also outstandingly beautiful. There just aren't enough good things I can say about this CD so I will just close by saying to you: Buy this one, you will NOT regret it!"
1,Terrible staples,"For a box of staples that advertises itself to jam less, these staples sure do jam a lot. As in, every time I tried them. They were okay when just trying to have them come out of the stapler individually (not stapling anything), but throw in some paper and my stapler (which has worked and continues to work with other staples) would not budge. So back to Amazon they go!"
2,Not good as a stand-alone product,"I had been hearing all this talk about how great staples were, so I decided to try some (before now I had been a paper-clip girl). Well, finally the big day came and the staples arrived. Boy, was I disappointed. I'm nimble-fingered, but I found it pretty damn hard to pry free one of these staples without dropping it, push it through the stack of papers with my fingers, and then bend the little metal arms down to hold it in place. Ended up poking a hole in my thumb a couple of times.Well, it turns out that there's a catch to this product. If you really want the staples to work well, you have to go back out and buy a STAPLER to put them in. I'm not sure I'm ready to shell out the extra bucks for one of those, though, so I'm going to see if I can't improve my manual technique with a little more practice."
2,Does the job but cuts the letter's contents too frequently.,"I had hoped this would help opening the volumes of business mail we get daily. While it works good on a lot of things, unfortunately it cuts whatever the contents is way too frequently so I have to take the time to tape whatever it is back together. I have to be cautious what I open with it so not to destroy any critical documents. It opens the envelope ok but by cutting off way too much of the envelope creating this problem. I would not re-order for business purposes which is unfortunate because it was priced good and it is very portable."
5,Swingline Staples,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anybody could buy for their very own personal time and pleasure.
5,Sharper and stronger than cheap staples,"These are sharper and stronger than cheap staples, so while generic dollar store staples are good for 3-5 sheets, these will go through much more. I had a jam just once over the past year of using them. They are more expensive than standards, but as you know it's always possible to make any product a little cheaper and a little worse. They are made in China, however."
3,"So, they're staples.","Staples. We needed 'em, and bought 'em.Pretty standard quality, only thing I don't like is that the strips are not long - they're half-length. Some people might prefer this, but I just see it as me spending more time refilling them. If I put 2 halves in at the same time they tend to jam when the 2nd stick starts (does this with any staples, though, not just these)."
3,OK but not complete,"This is a list of 80's Gold and it doesn't have Michael Jackson, Joan Jett, Chicago, or Madonna? Some good material on the disks but far from a complete set."
5,COOKBOOK EXTRAORDINAIRE,"I HAVE OWNED THIS COOKBOOK FOR ABOUT 20+ YEARS AND HAVE USED IT CONTINUOUSLY FOR AS LONG A TIME. WHEN I WENT THROUGH MY DIVORCE, LUCKILY I WAS ALLOWED TO KEEP THE BOOK IN MY POSSESSION, BUT I HAVE TRIED TO BUY A COPY FOR MY EX-WIFE WITH NO SUCCESS. SHE REALLY LIKES IT TOO. THE RECIPE FOR THE LEG OF LAMB IS A RECIPE OF WHICH IS A THOUSAND YEAR OLD FROM MESOPOTAMIA AND IT IS AWESOME. FINGER LICKING GOOD. THE BHUNA GHOST RECIPE IS ALSO AWESOME."
3,New New York Times Cookbok,"I actually purchased two used copies of the New New York Times Cookbook! Each copy was from a different seller, but both books arrived in a very timely fashion and in excellent condition.However, this is not a book for a novice cook. Some of the recipes are complex and many of the recipes are not for ""every day"" eating at all. Also, some of the recipes call for kitchen equipment that only professional or gourmet cooks may own. Thus, to me, this cookbook is for a gourmand, not someone just looking for new recipes to tryout on the family."
2,"O.K., I guess..........","I got this book to either help me design my own wedding flowers or to get ideas for my florist. I think I could have found better pictures in the bride magazines. The book had some pretty flowers but most of the arrangements were just O.K. or outdated. There wasn't a very large variety of boquets to look at, it was mostly composed of the similar large arrangements with different flowers. Don't get me wrong, it did show a few diagrams on constructing arrangements, but it was nothing to get excited about."
1,You get what you pay for,Cheap speaker not worth the time to install. Poor sound and too much impedance!
1,No Sigur Ros?,The most powerful song in the movie is Staraflur by Sigur Ros. You remember the song - it's at the very end of the film when they are watching the shark? It makes the scene much more...intense. And it's not on this soundtrack? That's ludicrous. Omitting it is inexcusable and worthy of a one star rating.
4,Bowie in Portuguese....How can you go wrong?,"This soundtrack is fantabulous. You've got a few original Bowie songs plus a few more done in Portuguese by Seu Jorge, who is an amazing artist. There are additional tracks w/ other music from the movie that are also very well done. I reccommend to anyone who really enjoyed the movie."
4,I'm not writing this to be helpful or anything...,"I just had to say somewhere that I'm as surprised as other people are about the Sigur Ros song not being on this soundtrack. I saw The Life Aquatic on Christmas and I loved the movie, and I loved how Wes Anderson made music such a large part of it, as he does with every movie he makes. When they got to the last scene and 'Staralfur' played, it almost made me cry, and I was really happy because knowing Sigur Ros had 'Svefn G Englar' on the Vanilla Sky soundtrack, I figured they'd for sure put 'Staralfur' on The Life Aquatic soundtrack. With it not being on there, I just burnt my own CD of the soundtrack and added it to the end. Its really not the same without it."
4,Another Randall Poster/Mark Mothersbaugh Effort,"Admittedly I haven't been yet to see the film. My sister gave me the soundtrack for christmas, knowing that I have the other 3 Poster/Mothersbaugh collaberations (Bottle Rockets/Rushmore/The Royal Tennebaums). I think this soundtrack is similiar in that it grows on you like mold. Good mold. The Devo song ""Gut Feeling"" was awesome, its the song of the album for me. Quirky Mothersbaugh does his elecronica again and he attempts another canon, it works. The Seu Jorge acoustic tracks is different and sticks in your head. I just wish there was more artists featured. On Royal Tennebaums, I ended up checking out the Nick Drake and Nico, but from this effort I may only pick up a Devo Greatest hits. Maybe the movie will inspire me to love this morning."
2,Too much elevator music.,"I was intregued by the Brazilian reworking of the Bowie tunes when watching the movie, and was hoping the CD would follow suit. Unfortunately, too much of CD is just elevator music which sounds as if played on a cheap Casio keyboard."
3,So/so,"Not a great soundtrack, but its ok. Bowie is awesome as always, and the other bands are ok.Not earth-shattering."
1,Seu Jorge is a bad singer,"Seu Jorge is one of the worse brazillian singers. He's a terrible liar. He sings Bowie's songs like someone who plays in ""pizzarias"". Your way of play guitar is very conventional too. But, the other songs are very good.(Apesar de se sentir uma autoridade em assuntos brasileiros, Seu Jorge no passa de mais um cantor medíocre, como qualquer um que se v nas pizzarias por aí. A MTV insiste em apresentá-lo como gnio, a mídia em geral insiste nessa idéia. Escute as verses dele de Bowie e perceberá o quo tosco ele é."
5,Great CD/Movie,This CD just makes me think of the movie every time I hear it....Seu Jorge makes the Bowie songs sound soooo Good....I would recommend this CD to any and all.
4,Great Music,I like this for driving music. Very little lyrics and lots of intriguing tracks that keep your mind moving :D I recommend this disc to anyone that like easy going upbeat happy sounding tracks.
5,"Bill Murry........if you like him, you'll love this!","If you like Bill Murray like I do, you will get a big kick out of this almost irreverent spoof of my childhood idol Jacques Cousteau.I have a feeling that the whole cast, crew, writers, and production team (the Andersons) have a thing for Cousteau like I do. That's why it works like it does."
5,Not Since Labyrinth have I heared so much Bowie,"Repeating first my review's title, not since labyrinth have I heared so much bowie. Glam rock seems so at home with the smart humor of this great film. Of course the bowie covers are sung in Portuguise and with but a single guitar but they are stupendous. if I could give this soundtrack a 6 out of 5 stars I would. Great for listening to while cruising in the afternoon, or coming down after a hard day at work. but then you have Iggy Pop... let me just say that if you enjoyed the movie give the soundtrack a chance, Laugh at the jokes in the movie knowing that 90% of the audience doesn't get it and finally remember no soundtrack can be complete without a little bowie!"
5,# 1,"Ok I am going to say it,this is the best movie soundtrack of all time,high or sober,sane or insane,whatever mental state you are in,it's amazing,you never get bored of the songs,my husband is addicted to it,i think i have mood disorder but this album is a mood stabilizer,seriously,such a great soundtrack,you can play it anywhere,no one i know have ever disliked this album,everyone becomes a fan of it actually,it is one of the greatest soundtracks to ever exist,who-ever compiled this album either was high as hell or just simply have powerful sense in music.Two thumbs way streched up!!"
5,Frenzal Rhomb Rips!,"I've got this CD and just about every other album, single, record of frenzal rhomb & not ONCE have i been dissappointed with any of them! frenzal are the most awesome punk band in australia & throughout the world! my favourite song is ""cones"" and hehe! i just love frenzal"
1,Out of date and shallow.,"I am always looking for good Mars resources for kids. Since it had a copyright of 2006, I expected this product would include some data, pictures and findings from Spirit and Opportunity -- but no, only up to Sojourner. While the CD gives some basic Mars facts, a kid or young adult could do much better surfing on the Internet. I think I wasted my five bucks (or so).Let's Explore Mars"
2,Poor Quality Sound,"The quality of sound is terrible. It's tinny, muffled and distant sounding. It sounds like a recording someone did at home while watching the movie. This is not on par with the quality of several other classic musical soundtracks I've ordered."
5,The Energizer bunny of all routers,"I came online here to pick up yet another plunge router ( I`ve gone through four in maybe 8 years) and happened across this old friend. 15 years of almost daily use building (professionally) over 750 guitars and other instruments - and, additionally, an almost house full of furniture to boot- and this little pal of mine just keeps going and going. Nary a repair, not a single moment of down time. To top it off, I`ve as yet not needed to change the brushes even. While most P/C tools are usually good this one has been just amazing! If only the plunge routers ( not one a P/C, I might add. Something that`s about to change) had been this good.PS A home improvement enthusiast. LOL! Not a chance!"
1,My experince with this bag,The bag was an utter piece of crap. The sides of it ripped off on my third day of using it and it carried only three average size hard bound books. I highly do not recomend anything from this company and will never buy their products again
1,never recieved this,I never recieved this product because after about 4 das i contacted the shipper and i was told that they know longer have this product for order. i was a bit irritated that no one called to let me know pesonally and i had to call them. although they apologized gave the money back and offered me a diff product. i did not want a diff one I wanted the one i choose. i will watch out for this company seller i will try never 2 order frm them in the future and i advise everyone to do the same.(or ay least watch to make sure u get what u pay for.
3,Tough but not that tough,"This is a ""tough"" knife, but not in the league with the other ""tough"" combat style knives. There is a great review of this knife with photos of the blade being destructed and a good analysis of the failure of the blade when abused. Do a search for ""Physics SOG Recondo knife review"" and it should be near the top of the list.The three stars is that it fails in the combat knife league (unable to take the abuse), and it fails as a general purpose camp knife. (poor cutting ablity for general purpose stuff.) You could regrind the blade but why should you have to?"
2,Not as aromatic as I expected,This Eucalyptus Candle was not as aromatic as I expected. Candle did not even last a few days. The wick burns out pretty quickly. I was not satisfied with this purchase.
1,Waste Of Money,"I love eucalyptus and this candle smells nothing like it. It has an unnatural and unclean smell, something akin to burning trash. If you like the clean smell of eucalyptus, keep searching because this isn't the candle for you."
2,It is tiny,So small you can barely light it and it smells like Vicks. If you want an aromatherapy candle- this is not a good pick.
1,Not worth the money!,"I did receive product on time and in good condition but was very disappointed with the extreme low dosage of ""Aromatherapy""Felt more like burning my money in smoke. Would not recommend and certainly not buy again."
1,"Terrible Candles-- Small, expensive, and poorly manufactured","When I got these candles, there were NO WICKS inside. Yes, there were no wicks, and the wax had melted to the top of the tin, flowing out of the tin and running down the sides. Both candles were UNUSABLE. There was no possible way to light it. Smelled good, but had to throw them away.On top of that, the candles are TINY. Expect to get 4 or 5 good evening worth of this candle and that's it. For the price, I would not recommend. Get some Yankee Candles if you want your moneys worth. Much better quality."
1,Not good...,"There's not a strong enough scent for me --- I can't even tell I'm burning a candle, let alone an aromatherapy candle. Also, it does not burn evenly....it burns in the middle, leaving unused product on the sides of the container. The other reviewers must have gotten some other candle! I bought 6 of these, as scents....for my daughter and for me. We both share the same reaction. Save your money and don't bother."
4,Sundays-------library book,"1968--215 pages-MICHAEL PAUL HARRIS.Edward Vincent ""ED"" Sullivan--he was a twin- 9/28/1901 to 10/13/1974.THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW 1948 to 1971. Listed as one of the 50 greatestTV shows of all times.Ed was originally a powerful gossip columinst. He and Walter Winchellhated each other.All of the guests performed LIVE on his show. ELVIS was seen waist uponly and THE BEATLES did their FIRST LIVE TV PERFORMANCE.That nitethey had 72 million viewers.Show cancelled 1971--poor ratings.Died of esophageal cancer and ulcers.My mom and I went to CHURCH sunday mornings and we watchedED every sunday nite.A good read.bbpokc okretired"
4,I liked it but...,I liked this book a lot but I would have liked more on the show as well as the stuff on Sullivan .This book has a lot on Ed but not as much on the show
5,Every Grandparent needs to read this,"I'm still reading, but I believe its a must read for every Grandparent who wants to leave their Grandchildren with an idea of Gods love from Grandparent to Grandchild"
5,First Rate.. Well Done.. Soprano's Like Enjoyment,"I am hooked.. much like the Soprano's in quality acting with suspense and action. I just finished the last episode of the first year and am catching up with my cable ""on demand"" previous episodes from this year. What a wonderful twist on a ""police drama"". Watch it.. You wont be sorry."
5,FANTASTIC BUT NOT FOR THE FAINTHEARTED,Incredibly creative story with interesting subplots. It might be considered socially irresponsible to make a serial killer a herobut he is always seeking-seeking-seeking a way to be normal. His narration of his feelings is very compelling to those with a psychological bent and boring to those without one.
5,Dexter on DVD,This is a bizarre show by any stretch of the imagination. There is so much more that comes across in the DVD though than the TV series due to editing. Very good entertainment.
5,"Intense, entertaining, strange but great show!!!",I'm glad I bought the first season in time to watch it and then watch season 2 on Showtime. Not a disappointment!
5,Title,I am relating the information I got from my daughter. I gave this DVD as a gift to her for Christmas. I have never seen any of this series!
2,Dexter,I DID NOT LIKE THE CONCEPT OF JUSTIFYING HIM BEING A SERIAL KILLER BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD GUYS. GOOD OR BAD HE IS A SOCIOPATH.
4,"Who is Dexter, really?","Dexter is a serial killer. We are not supposed to like serial killers, but one can't help but love him. After all, he only kills the really ""bad guys"" who need to killed. It is pretty bloody at times, so it's not for the ""faint at heart."" I liked the flash backs to his relationship with his stepfather who was a policeman."
4,Dexter 1st season.,"This show is awesome. If your looking for a show with the great combination of Law and Order and something a bit more gory, this is it. Truly one of the great shows on television."
5,awesome show,"I became hooked on this show after catchign a few free episodes on the 101 from directv. After catching the tail end of the series I had to see the beginning, Show is awesome a CSI type show, not as science-ie with an awesome twist on the main character. I definitely recommend buying now and recording the second season asap."
1,too violent,"I bought the pilot to check it out. i watched 15 minutes and hated it because i don't like violence, cruelty, blood and guts even if the victim deserves it. A little too off the wall for me."
1,"Dexter, First Season","Dvds were in baggies and looked like they had been bootlegged. Therefore, the quality of the screen was horrible. Also the packaging was cheesy. It was a terrible experience."
3,entertaining,My wife and I finished watching Six Feet Under and got this show (we have become fans Of Michael Hall). It kind of got off to a hokey start but we are starting to get into it and appreciate it as a satire. Michael Hall's performance makes the series worthwhile but the other characters tend to be caricatures (except for the character that Julie Benz plays).
2,boing,"thought the show was rather boring...not very ""edge of my seat"". definitly an original show idea i must say! i prefer, by a high mark, criminal minds..."
1,cant even watch all of the series,"""Attempting to read media"" straight out of the case disk 2. Tried cleaning, still nothing. And the title menus don't look great. Doesn't look like original disks (could be but doesn't seem.) Quality was poor on the first episode. Should have saved my money."
1,What a stupid show!,My sister-in-law INSISTED I would LOVE this show so I bought season one. I forced myself to get though the first four episodes hoping it would get better--some shows are slow starters--but I don't think I can get through any more. What an idiotic premise! Don't waste your time.
1,Doesn't work on HD 8.9,"I was so anxious to see this original series but it won't work on my Kindle 8.9 It runs for a few seconds and then pauses like forever. few more seconds of film, pauses again. Can't watch it."
5,Great viewing!,i enjoyed it tremendously. i happened upon the first episode on network TV and was hooked. the DVD is great.
4,awesome show!,"a relative recommended this show to me, and I'm glad she did (because since I don't subscribe to Showtime)...I wasn't aware that this series existed, until recently. Thankfully, Netflix took care of that little problem for me.Dexter plays a vigilante of sorts, a hero with a very dark side...he gives justice to those that the criminal justice system can't find or put behind bars.Michael Hall is a great actor, balancing a killer on the one hand and a likeable, lovable professional forensics expert on the other.....as he interacts in his various relationships.The show has comedy, drama, tension....it had just about everything...I guess one would label this a ""dark comedy"" type of series. Very dark.All the other characters in the show are interesting and fun to watch, and we see the dramas played out in their life through the eyes of Dex.This is a truly original series that hooked me quickly with its stories and interesting characters- highly recommended!"
3,See if you like it. Eh.,"It was OK. Didn't inspire me to download more, but it's worth seeing if you like it. Eh."
1,Bad,"I ordered a tv season and was sent the wrong one. I first had to pay $5 in shipping to send the wrong one back, and was only refunded $2.50. The whole process took over a month, and I sent the DVD back 2 weeks ago and though they said the money for the DVD was refunded to my credit card, it still has not gone through. Very unprofessional business and I would never order from them again."
2,"Don't buy thisproduct!!!!!!! You CAN""T watch episode 12 .....","without ""accepting"" 5 ""bonus"" items from stupid showtime. You HAVE to watch an EPISODE of another movie!!!!!!!, take surveys, download ""games"". YOU PAY $27 TO BE ADVERTISED TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you click ""decline"" the ""opportunity"" just loops back to accept/decline. CAN YOU IMAGINE SITTING DOWN THINKING YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE FINAL EPISODE OF A SERIES YOU ARE ALL STOKED ABOUT AND YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE EPISODE???????!!!!!!!!!Believe me, Amazon knows what they are selling to a MILLION people at $27 a piece. This product is falsely advertised. You are not buying YOUR DISCS; you are buying Showtime's advertising. SHAME AMAZON"
1,Made in Mexico CRAP,"I wanted to buy the first season of Dexter so that I could finally catch up on what all the fuss is about. I love this series however the copy of this series is CRAP! Its made in mexico stamp on the front distracted me at first but once I started watching it, the quality is awful. Fuzzy picture, sometimes scrabbles, picture is grainy. Will never buy a movie from amazon.com again!"
4,Liked the show - cheaper than a subscription to showtime,"The show is good - I usually don't think the show is as good as the book, but this was done very well (and no, it is not exactly the same as the book, so read it and watch the show)."
4,Best new sries of the last few years,Anyone else notice that the sex scenes from the original episodes are censored in this set? I wonder why.
2,"Excellent show, typical cheap Showtime DVD transfer.","Dexter is the best thing on television today, but the DVD release is marred by the fact that Showtime continues to release heavily over-compressed DVDs that look like they were transferred to VHS then copied to DVD. It does look good on my old low-def 7 year old TV, but it's blurry, choppy and has a considerably annoying combing effect on my PC. It's not as bad as Huff (which is nearly unplayable on my computer), but pretty much every other DVD I own plays and looks great on it.I give the show a definite 5-star rating, but the horrible Showtime transfer gets a big fat zero. What were they thinking?!"
4,Dexter is worth buying,"Dexter - The First SeasonDexter, the First Season is one of the most interesting, bizarre, sick, twisted, amazing shows that I've seen in a long time. The character development of Dexter is interesting to see, as this serial killer who kills serial killers appears to start to have actual feelings. His whole life, he's been faking it, with the skills his adopted father taught him.This show leaves you feeling something each time, sometimes its just pure entertainment, but more often, you are left with a gut reaction of repulsion or sorrow, but always wanting more. The only thing I would say is that if you're watching multiple episodes back to back, you need a sorbet before going to bed, otherwise the dreams you may have are completely whacked.I can't wait for Season Two."
3,Great show...bad disks,"I LOVE this show. It is worth keeping in the house to watch over and over. However, when i bought the disks they were scratched even though they were brand new! I couldn't even watch the season finale because the routing menu wouldn't work. I exchanged the disks with amazon for new ones and the new disks did the same thing. It must be a manufacturing error. Just be aware."
5,I'm Officially A Fan,"I have never watched a series this dark, complex and yet a little humorous at the same. It is brilliant to be able to dive into the inner psyche of a serial killer, to try and understand even if but a little, what goes through their cold and twisted minds. Michael C. Hall plays the character to perfection and it is mind boggling how the writers are able to deliver on each and every episode. I had to pace myself otherwise I would have watched the whole season in one day! I'm now waiting on the delivery of season2."
4,"Love it, But own it?","Dexter is a great show that is just so fresh and witty. It keeps a good pace for analyzing the show while you watch it. It will leave you thinking about it the next day. However, is this a show you need on DVD. If you like collecting great DVD shows or are a person that loves to watch television series over and over, then yes, this is a good series to buy. If you are like me though, you will check it out at the local movie rental joint and move on to next season."
5,Dexter,"We are loving the Dexter series! Michael C. Hall is rocking his role as Dexter!! The writing is great, with a lot dry humor sprinkled through each episode. We can hardly wait to see what happens next!!"
2,not for me,"love to see justice done on the bad guy, but too greusome, and he likes it.. not for me anyway"
2,Poor Picture quality,"I bought Dexter based on the good reviews and on the DVD I ordered from Amazon, the picture is barely watchable. The picture is blurry and completely lacking in sharpness you would expect from a DVD. I cannot watch past the first episode due to the poor quality of the DVD transfer. I would not recommend this DVD based on the picture quality."
5,Awesome service,This was sent out the same day I placed the order and received it just a few days later! The 1st season was amazing and I've now boughten the 2nd & 3rd season & I am now waiting for 4 to be released. A must see show!
1,Stupid,"I bought this for my wife - she likes it ... I think the show it utter stupidity! Why they make movies, shows like this is beyond me. No wonder our society if so messed up. Dexter, The walking Dead all need to be banned! It provides ideas for people to do crazy unthinkable things."
5,"Worked well, loved the episode.",Worked out great ( I downloaded from amazon video). The color was off at first (it was my first time using amazon video) and all I had to do was adjust the brightness and contrast on the video program and it was great. I love me some Dexter!
5,Amazing amazing amazing show! Loved it so much!!!,"This is one of my favorite shows... It is so good, and I can't wait to watch the 2nd season."
5,Good Crime Drama,Dexter is a crime drama with a twist. Very different from all of the other programs on tv.
3,"Dexter, First Season","Got the product fast, however there is some scratching on disc 2, which interferes with viewing"
1,Blood splatter,"Reading the story line is why I purchase the movie. I thought it would be simular to Criminal Minds but it does not come anywhere close. I can understand Dexter""acting"" as he does because he is suppose to not have any feelings, but the other characters have no excuse for their poor acting."

5,You can run but can't hide....,I had never heard of this show nor actor before until it came on CBS due to the writer's strike last year and a friend told me I should watch it. Glad that I took her advice. I love the whole series. I bought the DVDs and keep me on edge even though I had seen some on TV. The ice-truck killer is one of the best cases and it keeps people guessing. It also keeps the viewer guessing about Dexter's past which he cannot remember until it is almost too late. No one can play this role better than Michael C. Hall. Another actor in there who plays a doctor looks like Chris Sarandon so any fans of his will love this as well. But I highly recommend this show.
4,"Oh, that's a great episode!","Dexter is one of the few dark, uncomfortable(yet comfortable), shows...no, wait. Each episode feels more like a short movie that you Know that somewhere's along the line it will turn out to be a cult classic. Oh, and don't eat pork ribs when you watch this show."
5,Dexter is awesome,"What a series! Dexter is my new hero. He is a truely unique person who challenges the creative part of me. The actng is great, the screnery adds to the quality of the program and the surround sound is fantastic. I am amazed at the qualtiy of the series. It's better then many regular movies I have in my collection and a lot more fun to watch."
5,One of my all-time favorite series,"My friend turned me on to this show, so I picked up the first season. I was totally engrossed from episode 1 and in the interim bought the second season and finished that and have been waiting for the 3rd season to be released. It is VERY well told, suspenseful and with constant payoffs. In some series you kind of wait forever for things to happen. With Dexter, there is always something driving you to watch the next episode to find out what happens with the incredible turn of events. Absolutely love it. Not for the squeamish or vocab sensitive. But if you relish amazing storytelling and acting, this fits the bill in bloody spades, or plastic trash bags as the case may be."
5,Truly Great Series,"First read about Dexter series on Amazon.com and decided to try the first season, based on customer reviews. I immediately became hooked on the show and ordered the second season and have pre-ordered the third season as well. I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of the third season DVD! This is truly a great series in terms of acting, characters, storylines, and production. While not for the squeamish (at the sight of blood), highly recommended otherwise."
5,Great show!,I picked this up while Amazon had it on sale for only $13. I'd already become addicted to the latest seasons but hadn't gotten around to watching the first - all I can say is I'm glad I did! Amazing show - well worth the $20 it sits at regularly!
4,I really like this show,But it is not for everyone. Violence and some gore is definitely part of this show. But if you give it time and start to understand the characters you will really grow to like it. Every season seems to get better and better.
5,JSP,"Packaged nicely and arrived very quickly. Do not yet know the condition of the disc, since it was ordered as a Christmas gift. But very pleased with this transaction so far. Price was great! Would order from this seller again."
4,LOVE Dexter... Hate slow shipping,This season is great! I love dexter! if u do not watch the show yet u should... it is so addictive!! I love dexter but it did take forever to ship to me!
4,Entertaining,"I LOVED this series watching it the first time around. It's novel, and funny while obviously possessing a dark central theme.The second time around (which was years after originally seeing it, so I forgot all except the most major of details), I found that I noticed dexters narrative rambling was very repetitive throughout every episode, and that was definitely annoying. Other than that and the police work being no where near realistic, it's not a bad show.Purchasing through amazon was great because i can watch on my Kindle, computer or TV on my ROKU."
4,Dexter season one,I don't know what happened with the shipping from Amazon but I didn't get the Dexter Season One when they said i would it got lost in the mail. So Amazon sent it to me over night to Alaska and it was here for christmas.
5,The best show on earth.,"Dexter is spectacular. It is better than ALL of those crappy sitcoms that play on network TV. If you want to stop watching crap like ""Lguna Beach"" or ""The Hills,"" then try Dexter on for size."
5,Dexter rules!,I started watching this over winter break starting with season 1. Wonderful performances. Very twisted but very original. Great show!
5,Best show ever.,Addictive as hell to watch a tortured soul protect others from the evil he experienced and could have become. Love it.
5,Dexter Rocks!,"I don't have Showtime and therefore had not had the opportunity to see Dexter until recently. At the recommendation of a friend, I purchased and watched the pilot episode and I was hooked! I wasted no time ordering the entire season immediately after! I am halfway through season 1 in about 5 days time and fully intend to purchase the remaining seasons as I get to them. If you love murder mysteries, detective or police dramas, forensic themes or anything along those lines, this is a must see! There is however some adult language and themes including sexual scenes and graphic mutilation so it's not one for the kiddies but it is gripping adult entertainment. Do yourself a favor and get caught up in this one!"
4,Excellent show,"From his Six Feet Under days I've been a fan of Michael C Hall and had high hopes for Dexter. I was not disappointed. This is an excellent, original and very well executed series.The DVD boxset is OK. It could be better and include more features, but I suppose I can't complain for the price."
5,Replay value is off the charts,"One of only a few shows I can honestly say that I have watched many times through. I love Michael Hall and have loved him since Six Feet Under. It was hard to see him as a straight man in this serious for an episode or two and then I got used to it. That was the only hitch but not anyone's fault. People write horrible reviews for Dexter because their sense of morality feels to be in jeopardy by watching it. Its a great show. Depth, cliffhanger suspense, peril, gritty insight into each character as the seasons pass, unexpected twists. You really cant get better television than you get with Dexter. By far my favorite show ever put on the screen. Blu ray is definitely worth the extra few dollars as it is masterfully done both in sound quality and picture clarity. I LOVE THIS SHOW."
4,Dexter original quirky and unique,This totally unique plot is entertaining in a dark humor style. It can not be dismissed as just another cop show. I would recommend it only to mature adults with a twisted sense of humor.
2,too dark,"too gruesome. I watched the pilot and it was not intriguing, too violent and gruesome and this requirement for more words, suck!"
5,Nothing better than a serial killer with a heart of gold,As long as you are not squemish about blood and can appreciate irony you are in for a treat. Let's face it TV has become increasingly better than the movies coming out and this show certainly proves that point. Micheal C Hall proabably better know for his role on Six feet under has found another fantastic show and I have certainly fallen in love with his character and you will too. Enjoy the show!
4,"Dexter, Dark, but not gorry","I hate horror and gore, this show is not about that. There is plenty of blood though. The direction and the actors never seem to make things to heavy which is pefect to balance everything out. This show is really dark and will put a big old grin on your face. Acting, story, imagery, characters are all fantastic. Great Show! Not for the faint of heart."
5,PHENOMENAL!,"This was an amazingingly creepy and suspenseful season! I had never heard of this show before until some friends loaned me their season 1 set. Once you start, you can't stop watching! I'm hooked! Can't wait for season 2!!"
5,"Dexter is gleeful, sinister, brilliant entertainment!","This is one of the best, most innovative series I've seen in a long time. The acting is superb, the writing is superb; and to find yourself liking and actually rooting for a serial killer is so twisted and unexpected that it is actually a gleeful, guilty pleasure! I recommend this wonderfully off-kilter series to all adults with a dark sense of humor, and an appreciation for a well-done production."
5,born free,Dexter is the best show I have ever seen. Strongly recommended for the ones who is not shocked by blood scenes.
1,"Sick, Perverse and Sadistic","The best words to describe the show . . . sick, twisted, perverse, and sadistic. As America's fascination with sadism and death grows, so does our hunger to watch executions and gawk at grizzly car crash victims. Then, people who flock to ""art shows"" full of mutilated corpses and take sadistic pleasure in growing more sympathetic with a serial killer watch their evening news and wonder what's wrong with everyone else and how this world got so sick and twisted. If you aren't fascinated at the prospect of watching Internet videos of beheadings or snuff films for family entertainment, then you won't like this show either. Its as though the people who brought this show are conducting an experiment on how desensitized they can make people and how little regard for human life they can instill in the mind numbed TV watching drones of America. I won't even watch anything on ABC any more."
1,Disgusting,"This is not a nice program. There is nothing about it to enjoy. Dexter, the main character, has the eating manners of a dog and is disgusting to watch.The acting is below the level you see in High School plays and the story lines are even lower quality. If this program is what America is about, we are in trouble."
1,Dexter Season 1,"DEXTER SEASON 1 DOWNLOADI viewed episodes 1-10. This series is a cliffhanger. I was eager to view the last two episodes, but could not. Amazon's message to me was, ""Unableto play file, please try again later. If you continue to experience this problem, contact Amazon customer support and reference the following code: [0x80070057].I tried again for three consecutive days with the same result. Perhaps there is a customer support tab somewhere, but it is well hidden. I have not been able to respond to Amazon. The $19.95 download does not appear when I search ""Insert a product link."" How many of you have had this kind of problem with Amazons downloads?I am uninstalling the Unbox Video Player.Sincerely, Dr. J.E. Wright"
1,Bad experience,"After my son received Dexter Season One DVD as a gift from me, he discovered it had one major scratch and a couple other minor scratches which caused it to skip. I wrote the seller with absolutely NO response to date. I also wrote a review of the problem on the amazon.com website. Although I have experienced excellent results with past purchases from Amazon, I would not recommend this seller to anyone in the future!"
2,Poor download,I was disappointed with the quality of the download and the amount of time I had to wait for the episode to buffer and catch up to itself. Very disappointed and will look elsewhere to watch more episodes.
3,Too Predictable...,"Granted I have only seen the First Season and still plan to watch the others, but this season was too predictable. I was able to figure out the twists about 2 episodes before they were revealed. Solid Show, but a bit over-hyped in my opinion."
5,Good Book!,"Me, my mom, my brother and sister read ""Dry Bones and Other Fossils"" by Dr. Gary Parker. I thought this was a very good book. You should read it because it teaches us about how evolution and creation are completely different. I rate this book five stars."
1,"Authors are not ""authorities"" in the subject of fossils.","Note: the author Gary Parker is a biologist/zoologist NOT a paleontologist focused on the study of fossils and ancient life. His co-author, his wife, is a museum curator. This book places dinosaurs and humans on earth at the same time. It takes Scripture references and modern news reports out of context to support weak arguments about God's creation. A fundamentalist view of Scripture, creation and natural history. Please read this book carefully before handing it to your child as a factual book."
1,"Misleading as a ""science book""","While this book does give some valid information about fossils, it is really a Christian book about the Flood and how the Bible can explain different scientific phenomenon. I am a Christian, but I am also a public school teacher and it would definately not be appropriate for school use. My mom had ordered this book for my second grade class, but I can't even bring it in and read parts of it because of the constant references to God and Noah's flood being caused by sin, etc."
1,pseudoscience book,"I am disappointed and concerned that Amazon groups this book in with earth science. It should be classified with religious books or in a separate category altogether. This is NOT SCIENCE! It is taking a foregone conclusion and selecting parts of evidence the author ""likes"" while ignoring evidence that refutes his conclusions."
5,Swingline is Great as Usual,"These staples are strong and staple tightly to the paper without hiccups (jams, misfires, more than one staple per use, etc). These staples are used with a Swingline 210 Sheet Capacity stapler (of course)."
3,It's ok....,"I have neck and shoulder problems in the mornings and thought that this would be the perfect thing to help that. It didn't really help. It is exactly as described, it just doesn't do it for me. My neck and shoulders still hurt in the mornings when I wake. I found that if I sleep with a travel pillow along with my flat, regular pillow, that will suffice. Not great, but my neck and shoulders don't hurt as much in the mornings. This pillow is a bit to hard on the sides for side sleeping, and can't quite get used to the part under my neck. It has been several weeks and still pain. Don't know if I would recommend it or not. Everyone is different, but it just didn't work for me. It is the same pillow that is sold in the chiropractic offices but for much cheaper, so a good option if you want to try it out."
2,Miss understanding,After reading all the reviews about several pillows offered I choose the Mid Core Pillow because several of the reviews were postive and one stated that if I didn't unwrap or take the plastic off the pillow I could send it back if I didn't like it. It was too hard for me. But I found out that pillows are not returnable. Now I'm stuck with it.
3,Ok for first-time D-Core users,"I purchased this as a replacement for a worn-out D-core and am not happy with the support it provides. This would be a good pillow for someone who has never tried this type of pillow before, but since I'm used to the support under my neck, I would like a bit more filling."
2,"Good if you're a back sleeper, but...","I found this pillow to be very uncomfortable sleeping on my side. I bought this pillow to help give my neck support since I have sleep apnea. While it does a good job while I'm on my back, I often find myself waking up with neck soreness and minor headaches after I've rolled over on my side during sleep. Unless you're looking for a pillow that caters to just back sleepers, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Pillow is too hard!,I bought this in an effort to help my TMJ but when I woke up in the middle of the night I had the worst neck pain and my jaw was clenched. It put my head in a totally un-natural position. It was so firm that there was no give when I moved around so I got a horrible nights sleep. I have not used it since.
3,Neck Problems,My chiropractor recommended this pillow to help with my neck problems but I haven't seen a real difference in my condition and I have been using the pillow for one year now. The seller was great to work with though.
2,D-Core Pillow,"I had been having neck problems and hoped a different pillow would help. I read the reviews of the D-core, which was also recommended by my chiropractor, and was anxious to see how it worked. Unfortunately, it was not as comfortable as I had hoped. I got the smaller size as suggested by reviewers, but the pillow edge was still too high. I returned it (in original packaging), only to find out that there was a restocking fee that I wasn't aware of. I got a side-sleeper pillow from Bed Bath & Beyond which is working much better for me."
3,Not for me,"I bought this pillow with high hopes of saving my neck and shoulder area. It seems that it just made things worse. :( Don't get me wrong, it may work for a different body type...but you just won't know unless you try it."
3,Nice,"I really like this pillow. It has helped me with my neck pain from the first night. The only thing I don't like about it is it's a little too hard. I put a thin feather pillow over it and it's much more comfortable. Almost perfect. I suggest the company make a ""pillow top"" covering for it. That way the firmness wouldn't be lost, but there would be a little bit of cushioning to make it more comfortable."
3,Too Firm to Easily Break In,I've tried for a few weeks now to get used to this pillow but found I had more neck pain in the morning than with my last neck pillow. It's a good pillow if you truly prefer a firm pillow but for other people like me who need support but comfortability then I would suggest selecting a softer pillow.
1,False promises!,I purchased this pillow because it promised to help with neck pain. My pain has actually gotten worse since I began using this pillow. I did tests with my regular pillow and this one and I had far less pain with my $5 pillow from Target. Horrible product!
3,Too firm for me.,I sleep on my back and need a soft pillow that doesn't put pressure on my neck. I could tell without opening the package that this pillow is not the right one for me. What I want is a pillow that will support the sides of my head (to keep it from falling to one side or the other) but does not have much support under my neck. Microbeads would be best for me but I couldn't find one with the right shape. This pillow is probably fine for side sleepers.
5,good product but not for me,"I purchased this pillow hoping to find just the perfect pillow for me and my migraines, but it is way too large and too hard for me the pillow itself is of great quality and construction really great fabric for the cover but as I said just to large and hard to suit me."
3,firm pillow takes getting used to,"Like other reviewers, I found it difficult to get used to the firmness of this pillow. It is very good for side sleeping, not so much for back. The edge of the pillow is higher on one side, so if you need it to be a little less high on your neck, there is a lower and a higher side."
1,Beware!,"Just so you know, I thought this was just a collection of Beatles songs that happened to be priced really low. I should have read the page more closely. What it actually is: Beatles songs turned into elevator music, with no words or anything. If that's what you're looking for, go ahead and buy it. But if you're looking for actual songs, look elsewhere. Just a warning so you are not unpleasantly surprised like I was! :-)"
5,This is a good book,This book is the second book of the andalite chronicles. This book won't make a lot of sense unless you read the first book of the series.
4,"bought as a gift, seemed to be right...","Bought this for someone else (my brother) who was looking to replace another fitness ball. Seems to like it and uses it to work out with, no complaints."
3,"Dog 1, Medicine Ball 0","The ball was a lot smaller than I expected, but it seemed to work OK for what I wanted. Until my dog got a hold of it, that is. To be fair, it does look a lot like a dog toy. The cover must've ripped in seconds (it seemed awfully flimsy once deflated) and we came home to piles of black sand all over our living room. Will be looking for a larger and more sturdily constructed medicine ball for my next one."
4,weighted ball review,"Overall this is a good product, but I really wish that I could have gotten more details on the product. I am happy with the product and use it frequently in my exercise routine."
1,What the heezy???,"This feels like it's a bunch of sand coated with a black plastic bag!! The shape changes constantly!!! Errrrrrrrrr!!I couldn't tell by the photo but it's about as big as a ""grapefruit"".I guess it does the job ...........but it looks awful and so non-cool!"
1,More Cheap DVDs,"Oh, Awesome! More Cheap DVD releases from Warner Home Video containing only 3 episodes! Could it get any worst than this?"
2,NEGATIVE...,"Negative...The 1st season of The Batman was ok, but the second season ruled...third season is mediocre so far. I want the second season. The only worthwhile episode on this disc is ""The Big Chill"". The other 2 are lack luster. The Big Chill had a lot of stale ""Freeze"" jokes, but was well presented.A 2 out of 5 stars."
1,Don't bother!,"This is just a giant slap in the face! First of all, WB totally bothches the first season, and THEN try to get you to pay for a DVD with THREE episodes on it! How insulting! The second season is better, but still garbage. They should focus more on Justice League Unlimited. Now, THAT is a show worth watching!"
3,?,"I dont know if the staples are a bit weak or the brand new Bostich stapler isn't that great, When I try to staple a large amout of documents together the staples get bent at the top and don't always make it through."
1,Terrible,"If you are someone who doesn't know much about bonds, and you are hoping this book will explain it. Don't buy it! This book is terribly organized. It never really tells you what bonds are. It also tells you about the theory behind the bonds before it tells you what kind of bonds exist! The text is also terribly dull."
3,Mixed,"The fourth edition is excellent in that all major topics in modern population genetics are covered and with a minimal need for advanced math. However, there are numerous small errors in both the text and the answers to problems posted. These errors are not a major obstacle for advanced users, but can be confusing to students new to population genetics, and especially those that have not had a math course in recent years. I recommend it over other texts for teaching, but students and instructors should be aware that these errors exist."
4,ITS WORTH GETTING IT!,"I belong to a Praise Musical Team at my church and someoneintroduced me to Jars of Clay. Wow! The first one,wasthe most refreshing music I have ever listened to,comparedto these bands that are all sounding the same! So any way,I callThe first Jars of Clay album, the ""Abbey Road"". Now withthe ZOO cd ,I call this ""SGT Peppers"" cd. It is a littlewerid as you first hear. They have listened a lot to the Beatles, the writting staff for each song is superb! But listening to it again and again, vocal harmonies,would sound like Paul McCartney ,belting out a vocal line.This band is the bestband that has hit the christian music seen in ages,these guysare more than just creative,they are incredible! Buy the 1stJars cd,then buy Scared(2ndone),then the Zoo will make perfectsense. Wonderful! Cant get enough!"
4,Good acoustic pop-rock album,"Almost five stars, but the songs are almost all the same. Otherwise perfect album of guitar-driven rock-pop music"
5,"Jars of Clay, If I left the Zoo","I have always enjoyed the music of Jars of Clay. But their new album just plain makes me proud. This is superb composition. Their new album, in my mind, ranks them as some of the best pop-folk songwriters in the business. The Christian themes on the album seemed to stem from a true-life walk with God rather than a fabricated, emotional concoction that exists on many ccm records. I am coming back to Christian music as a postmodern generation lends their remarkable creative ability to the genre. jars of Clay is leading the way through the woods. And they are pleasant company. this is a terrific album."
2,Plenty of more interesting stuff out there...,"I'm a big fan, loved them in concert, have played the second CD especially, though I love the first as well. I find in them riches worth returning to! Zoo doesn't seem to warrant much digging and savoring. Surprised at the lack of criticism amongst these reviews...I'm not trashing their faith, witness, or anything...just disappointed (even after a number of listens) and wondering if another reviewer was correct about the influence of marketers less evident in previous JOC outings."
4,I loved this CD!!,"Ok, I know alot of people thought that Jars of Clays latest release ""If I Left the Zoo"" was a poor effort...but come on!! I loved it! I thought it was great and liked that it had a different sound than their frist two albums. And I also think its great that they were able to break into the mainstream market with their work. I am only 14 and hope to break into the industry some day, and I have to tell you, the Jars have been one of my biggest inspirations!"
2,Pure tedium,"Their first, self-titled album was wonderful. After that, Jars of Clay got the classic more-of-the-same syndrome, and this is no different. All the tracks on this CD are essentially similar, and become boring and tedious after about the fifth track. It may be the fact that Christian rock is mostly so-so anyway, but Jars of Clay completely bombed on this attempt. While two of the tracks (""Collide"" and ""Unforgetful You"") prove to be a refreshment from the dragged-out remainder, they're hardly worth buying the CD for. If you're a die-hard Jars of Clay fan, you may like this CD. But being, for the most part, a casual JoC fan, I would recommend purchasing this album to only those who are really into the Christian contemporary genre."
1,Further disappointment,"I stumbled onto the FIRST album and fell for the acoustics and odd chord rifts and strumming patterns. It is truely a work of genius. It is the first album I have own that I play straight through, start to finish and still do.""Much Afraid"" was about half as good because it has more canned stuff and more poppy.""...Zoo"" seems to be a complete departure from the original, which is probably due to pressure to make money and strive for popularity like so many do.But be assured, someone else will pick up where they left off."
4,Pretty good album,"I am not too much of a fan of Jars of Clay, but this is a very good effort here. I only wanted to hear what the rest of this album was all about as I already have made my mind up that ""Unforgettable You"" is the weakest of all the songs on this album. Now that's out of the way I can tell you the positives of this album. ""Goodbye...Goodnight"" which kicks off this album is good, but wouldn't have made it the opener because that would be sending a mixed message with the song that follows it. The third song on this album is probably the best on here as I just sampled these songs I may buy the album now. It seems that the group was trying to create more of a pop album here than their traditional alternative sound, and that may have been the thing that backfired on them with this album. It's really a decent sounding album give it a chance."
3,They should never...,"Work with this producer again. Rather than let them create in their own unique style and let them evolve with this album. He forced them to lose the strings, add stupid sound bites into the middle of nice songs, and it seems like each song is missing something that was probably left on the editing room floor. Much Afraid was a masterpiece, and this album was catchy and not bad. But it doesn't have enough longevity, and these guys can do better. They should be left to be themselves though. Dump this producer!!"
2,Lyrics are getting worse,"I have listened to the previous two Jars of Clay Cd and I liked them, especially the first one. The reason I liked it is because of the Christian content and the message, it seems this one is going more mainstream and dropping in the content. It is a horrible album and the only song I liked was unforgetful you, I am highly disappointed."
1,JARS FROM MARS,"I still dont see any good Christian message in any of there music, and I know im not the only one out there. So because of that I give them 1 star because of poor ministerial advice."
2,"Better, still dwarfed by their first","As opposed to ""Much Afraid"" there are a few songs on this album I genuinely like, though still a far cry from their first work. I am all for artists developing their work over time like PFR, but to me they seemed to abandon everything I liked musically about the first album and started over with an inferior sound. Speaking of PFR, on first listen through I thought this album borrowed from PFR's ""Them"""
3,if i left the zoo,"it was pretty good. the songs all sounded too alike, but they had the right idea. the lyrics are really good-just need to diversify the sound a bit."
5,Another great album from JOC,"This cd is so great. I, personaly don't think it is as good as ""Jars of Clay"" or ""Much Afraid"", but it's hard to follow 2 great cd's better than they were. ""Unforgetful You"" and ""Collide"" are my fav songs cause they have awsome guitars. Their acoustics rock. I recommened this cd to any JOC lovers and any christian cravers for pure music that is satisfactory. Great follow up album to ""Much Afraid"". Good job guys:)"
5,Once again.....AWESOME!,"Let me tell you this one thing....If you've ever been a Jars fan, well, this CD will just make you more of one! And if you aren't a Jars fan, well, I'm sorry. They're great! They really bring something unique to the Christian music industry. They have a style like no other! I have yet to meet someone that DOESN'T like the Jars, and I hope I never do! Even if you're not too sure about ""Christian"" music, give them a chance! They truly glorify God in their work! They're awesome!"
3,Not What I Expected,"Before I owned this album, I owned WoW 2001. On it was one of their songs, Unforgetful You. I just loved that song and, decided to but their album. When I popped my new CD in my CD player I was disapointed by the huge difference in their Unforgetful You and their title track. Goodbye, Goodnight was a lot softer mooded than what I expected. The only other song I like is Collide. If you like pop christian, buy it. But, don't buy it if you like chritian rock."
5,The Best!,"This record is full of moving lyrics, beautiful ballads, and rocking pops (slang for upbeat songs). I absolutely loved it, and the words...i cant get over how deep they are. Wonderful and highly recommendable work!"
2,I had it for a couple months,"I had this album for a couple months and then decided to sell it. Why? Because I rarely listened to it anyway.It is obvious in listening to this album that Jars of Clay was attempting to be more playful in the way they played. However, I think, if anything, this album comes across as being too playful, and not serious enough musically. (Almost like Jars of Clay are two-year-olds or something).None of the songs really inspired me musically. ""Goodbye Goodnight"" is just plain annoying. ""Unforgetful You"" is ok. There are a few other ok tunes, but nothing's worth the price of the CD. If you want to hear ""Unforgetful You"" just buy the WoW that it comes on."
5,Well worth a listen,"I couldn't wait for this album to come out, and it definately didn't disappoint me. In my opinion their first album had amazing musical value with fairly bland yet poingant lyrics. Much Afraid, their second album offered deep inspiring lyrics which forced the listener to concentrate on themselves, but I found the music to be on a somewhat lower level than their self titled release. This release was the perfect fusion of the two, the music was rich and soothing while the lyrics were passionate and full. Overall both a great album for the common listener who just wants a good piece of music, and the Christian who wants to be challanged in their faith."
2,"Wonderful sound, but what about the content?","Being a rabid Jar-head, I was salivating over the release of this album. As usual, the boys' sound is wonderful, but what in the world happened to their lyrical content? One doesn't have to say Christ's name to praise Him (as their self-titled album proved), but this CD plummets off of the edge in terms of spiritual depth. ""Famous Last Words"" seems to glamorize apostacy (""Narrow is the road and too high a price to pay/When loneliness is such a sanctuary"") and the ambiguity of ""Hand"" leaves one confused as to just how Dan Hastltine views savation: are we held in God's grip securely or tenuously? Most of the album is filled out by mediocre love songs. I miss the passion and depth of ""World's Apart"" and ""Liquid."" The only notable exception on ""If I Left the Zoo"" is ""River Constantine."" Shame boys. Hurry up, it's not to late to pick up that dropped ball."
3,"Different, yet inspired.","I must say, this new cd has a very different style to it, but it's not at all a bad style. It's actually pretty interesting, listening to what Jars has done with this album. I personally like ""Much Afraid"" the best so far, and cannot understand why several people posting reviews have not LOVED that cd! I don't understand where everyone is getting all this ""Jars gives a brighter, more pleasant feel to this album than in the previous, darker ""Much Afraid."" That just doesn't make any sense to me. Overall I think ""I left the zoo"" is a great cd (and as others have noted, the songs DO grow on you), but I hope the band will return with another cd that has the same impact as Much Afraid did on me. Some favorites on the newest cd are: ""Goodbye,Goodnight"" and ""Famous Last Words."" ""Sad Clown"" is particularly interesting as well. ""If I left the zoo"" is DEFINITELY worth buying, as it is yet another inspired work by the extremely talented JarsofClay."
4,excellent followup to much afraid,"Unlike ""Much Afraid,"" where a lot of the songs sounded similar musically, ""If I Left the Zoo"" returned to the level of diversity found on their debut album. High Points: Collide, No One Loves Me Like You, I'm Alright. I highly recommend this album if you're new to the Jars or a returning fan."
1,No Talent to Speak of,Do not waste your money and time on these no talent bums. They can't writeanything listenable.
4,Definitely One of their top 3,It isn't as good as their other two but it's still great. If you don't have their other two you should get them first. But this is still a great CD and it's definitely worth buying.
4,Pretty good,"Actually, it was a great cd, but not for jars of clay. Much afraid was by far their best album, and I was slightly dissapointed when I listened to this one. I've always liked jars of clay because they were so different from other bands. Still, they're a great band and this is a great cd."
3,The Third Best by Jars,"Well, I've listened and listened and listened and still feel this is their weakest CD. Their debut by far has the most amazing lyrics and emotion. No One Loves Me Like You is a wonderful song, but, much of this CD just hasn't given me the goose-bumps from their past two realeases, especially the debut. I find it hard to believe that fans can actually find this CD more powerful. It's not even close for me! Sorry."
2,please do not waste your money on this cd,"althought jars of clays self titled album and much afraid were flawless peices of art, you can barely recognize the distinctive quality of their music on this one. it is really bad. jars of clay seem to have abandoned their roots with this one, although the music still has the christian ethic to it."
4,Jars of Clay's third CD is a different animal,"I admit that I have been a Jars of Clay fan since the first time I heard their first single ""Flood."" After listening to the cd for months I was eager for the follow up. When their second release ""Much Afraid"" was released I had to take a second listen to make sure it was the same band. It was a typical sophomore release. Now with the release of Jars of Clay's third cd ""If I left the Zoo"", I can honostly say that they have came out of the sophomore slump and hit a homerun. The opening track ""Goodbye, Goodnight"" is a catchy sing along dealing with the millinium in a sarcastic tone. The cd has a few songs the radio will like, however it is full of songs that Jars of Clay fans will listen to over and over."
3,Decent if you can find the right printer settings,"I originally tried out the Memorex matte case inserts, which worked okay, but still wasn't entirely satisfied with the quality. These work much better once you figure out what printer settings work best. At first I set my HP Photosmart 1215 to Premium Photo Paper Gloss, but they came out looking worse than the matte ones. Once I set it to Photo Paper Matte Finish, they came out looking much better. Go figure.In the end they worked pretty well. However, be prepared to waste a few trying to figure out what looks best, as well as trying to configure/align the template to print right."
1,Do not work with Epson Inket,"I ordered these, printed out an image, and it was aweful. The packaging says that is it guaranteed to work with all inkjet printers, but that is hardly true. The colors had splotches in them, and the lines that were supposed to be straight would bleed color. I was printing with an Epson Stylus Photo 785EPX using both the premium photo glossy and photo glossy film settings. I've had no problems with the Fellowes brand, and will be going back. Just thought I would try these to save a couple bucks."
5,tried to run but couldnt hide,"well, when i first listened to this album in it's entirety i must say the first thought that popped into my head was, ""man, what a waste of time, money, and talent"". thankfully i stopped writing things off so quickly and gave this album another chance and boy was i wrong. this is one softly tough piece of work here. i would recommend this album to people who like experimental music. the whole idea of this album was to blend two talents and i think it worked out quite well. thanks for the time. peace to all."
4,Unhook Yourself from the Future,"I always thought that having goals was overrated. Things change in our lives all the time. What I desired in my twenties are not the same things I aspired to in my 30's, 40's, and now 50's. The journeys have been far more engaging than the things I achieved. I found when I reached a goal, I felt empty, almost sad.It was not a beginning at all-it was an end! Today always brings another challange, another opportunity. As Joseph Campbell says, we are all on a Hero's Journey. We fight the good fight, battle through demons and dragons, love and lose love and ultimately either perish or live to tell our stories. Perhaps a bit dramatic but nevertheless a wonderful metaphor for confronting the challanges of life itself. You cannot leave your life to a precarious future the time to act is now!"
2,Overly Simplistic,"The book feels as though it caters to those looking for the quick, simple, check-list approach to life. While the thoughts in this book aren't wrong (in my opinion), they lack much depth. It is a quick read but not something likely to be remembered. Luckily it is well organized and short, so it is easy to find topics you want to review."
1,Not what I expected,I was very dissapointed with this book. I thought it was poorly written and offered little or no insight.
2,Deeply disappointed,"Very disappointed in this product. They work just fine but re-installed the factory speakers since they are louder and have better sound quality with the aftermarket Sony X-plod head unit. Also didn't fit in the factory location even though they are supposed to be ""the same size."" Wouldn't waste money on these."
3,Worth it just for Disc 2,"This cd set is a tale of 2 discs...Disc 1 is very slow, and for me, pretty boring. Stella is a good song, as is Rabbitweed (and Belfunk) but I'm not sure they're really trance. (Seem more like progressive house to me). And some of the other songs are really really slow, almost ambient like. Not bad if you like that sort of stuff, but not what I was expecting.Disc 2 starts off slow with a song that should have been entitled 'Snooze' instead of 'Move!' (and also sounds more like techno, which I hate, than trance), but after that, starts getting going. All the songs on disc 2 (except the first) are great (and fast). This is what I think of as trance.I'd rate disc 2 a 5, and disc 1 a 2. This is certainly worth buying, but kind of disappointing."
5,CD 2 is the reason to get this CD,"I know CD1 of this compilation seems lame in comparison to CD2, but if you just listen to the amazing progression of track 3 (CD2), then you'll be convinced that Dave Ralph could almost be comparable to Paul Oakenfold. I heard both of them spin at the Roxy in NYC, and they were amazing! The tracks on CD2 meld beautifully together and of course, Atlantis's Fuji is one of the best songs on the Cd2. I think this is one of the few CDs i have bought where every song is good. Others were the first Tranceport (oaky) and CD2 of Seb Fontaine's Prototype 2. Also, Cd1 of Paul Van Dyk's Vorsprung is sublime! Get Dave Ralph if you like ""good"" trance."
5,Excellent one that grows on you,"I have owned this CD for over 2 years, but never really listened to it. Last week I decided to put it in my player and see what I thought of it. After the 4th time around, it has really grown on me. He mixes well, and does not overdo his songs. I expecially like his version of ""Toca Me"". This CD reminds me of Dave Seaman at Buenos Aires."
1,IT SUCKS.,"I listened to cd1 at a listening station and had to wait for two people to finally get off it. boy was i disappointed. all the tracks are played out already and theyre on every damn ibiza or trance compilation out now. if you REALLY want to hear how trance is done, get john digweed's HONG KONG by global underground. the best ive heard in a long long time. dave ralph (barf) is just riding oakey's coat tails. and when can we expect amazon to get tsuyoshi suzuki's cd?"
2,Not a worthy compilation,"The tranceport collection has proven to be one of the weakest compilations to date. I suppose it is my distaste for trance music that leads me to such a conclusion, but I find some trance to be dominant, such as Future Primitive. The music compiled on this cd (with the exception for maybe 2 songs), is weak. The beats are not hard, the mellow, laggard trance style is preserved and for those of you who love to feel the music you dance to, this doesn't necessarily make the cut. The beats extract nothing from the soul.Those of you who enjoy listening to Sasha and Digweed would love this one, it's your cup of coffee, but I submit...and leave trance music for those who love nothing more than tasteless, monotonous, dead, limpid, weak, floating music.For those of you who love this style of music, grab your glowsticks and wave your hands to this one.....it's good for a soft, mellow hand motion....nothing more."
1,I was bored stiff,"I listened to CD one and was bored to tears. It's plodding, why he used the word trance in the title and was allowed to get away with it is a mystery to me. CD Two wasn't much better. He takes recognisable songs like Stella, Belfunk, and Toca Me and distorts them so much you can hardly tell the original classics that they are. I didn't appreciate wasting my money on this compilation as I have not listened to it since that first time."
5,"Good, Smooth Trance","Good CD, can't really decide which one I like more but track 9 (Velvet) on disc one is superb. Tandu is the bomb. Not to get off the subject this CD is a must have for the trance lover. Highly recommended. P.L.U.R."
4,Dave Ralph pilots a Journey with Tranceport 2.,"I bought trnceport 2 about a week ago, after seeing Dave Ralph and Paul Oakenfold spin here in L.A. It's a clear distinction that Ralph and Oakenfold reach somewhat overlapping audiences; however, they deliver the same 'musical' message. My impression with Tranceport 2 is a good one. This mix is for those who prefer ""Trance as a journey"" as opposed to the back to back intensity a lot of great Trance mixes offer. Through ""Departures"" and ""Ärrivals"", Dave Ralph offers a very nice Trance Compilation in Tranceport 2. Well worth buying."
5,if I could rate it a 10.....,"OK....Well my last review of this CD was a little premature so I need to redeem myself. This is one of the best trance CD's out right now.....Disc one is great, but a little slower. The second CD.....OH WOW! IF you want some off the hook club trance, this CD is one for you.....It is in my CD player non stop when i'm in the mood for trance. Oakie is the man, Ralph is filling the shoes just fine."
2,What's the big deal?,"I don't understand what the big deal with Dave Ralph is. He's not a bad DJ, but there are dozens of others (both underground and mass-market) who equal or surpass him. Certainly he is nowhere near the incredible talent of the other two Tranceport artists (Oakenfold and Collins). His music makes great low-key house/trance, good for unwinding, or maybe listening to after you're cracked out. But it lacks the energy and the progression that is the halmark of the greats, and I'm not sure why people here and elsewhere insist on elevating him to such status."
5,The best in the series,"To me this is the best album in the Tranceport series, followed closely by Transport 4 by Max Graham. Disc one is totally amazing, the first two tracks pay off the entire money you will spend here. The mixing is amazing and the dark mood and floating ambient it creates is out of this world. The second disc is excellent as well but a little lighter. I must say that at first CD2 was my favorite but CD1 is just a huge grower. If you like dark trance with no commercial ornaments and catchy stupid tunes this is for you !"
3,Ralph does so so,"I been a trance fan for a while and also a Dave Ralph fan. I was expecting much more from this album. Disc I is one that is not too memorable, with Feel So High as the only worthy track. Disc II is much better with Toca Me being my favorite. Disc II was good but still not as good as I expected from Dave Ralph. Tranceport II was not as good as the initial Tranceport, but watchout for Tranceport III with Sandra Collins, I'm expecting big things from her. This is a good CD to have but my suggestion is to get the Gatecrasher Wet album for more memorable tracks."
5,very very good,"An extremely laid back vibe working on this one. Almost feels like a Northern Exposure set. Disc One is a slower, groovy start to this awesome cd standout tracks on cd1 have to be Rabbitweed,Arms of Orion, and Feel so High. Disc Two is a more danceable faster adventure this disc is so damn smooth. peaks on this side are Toca Me, Dreamcatcher, and Fiji is amazing. So if you're a fan of Sasha And Digweed go buy this now...very very cool"
3,"Very Good, But...","I thouroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. I was more impressed with the start of Disc one, and the middle of disc two, but overall a very strong compilation from Dave Ralph. I really think that we are going to hear more great things from this guy. The best thing about this mix, is that is really makes you want to get up and dance. One track inparticular, in track 3 one disc one, Airtight-Sealed. A tremendous track that is blended beautifully from previous track. It gathers itself and explodes to point where you want to just shake yourself right into a club and go. So, I think that this is a solid purchase for fans, but advice for the casual listener, stick with something a little more anthem. Like the first Tranceport."
3,Raver from SF,"I wouldn't say this CD is a must. It just doesn't have the same punch as Tranceport, but then again, Tranceport is a tough act to follow. CD 1 is cool, starts slow and speeds up nicely. CD 2 is cool as well, songs #6-9 are of particular note. Enjoy."
5,It's in my survival kit - need I say more?,"I purchased a SOG Seal 2000 back in the mid '90s and after carrying it in my earthquake/survival kit for over 15 years and using it for everything from opening boxes and cutting rope to hewing tree branches, I can't recommend this knife highly enough. The durability and edge retention are outstanding, the grip is sure and comfortable for extended use, and it is completely impervious to the elements. Mine looks practically new even after my ham-handed abuse. While I have never had to use it as a weapon I would feel confident doing so due to it's balance and sharpness. Of all the fixed blade knives I own this is the one I chose to put in my survival kit. Alongside my Annihilator wrecking bar and my Cold Steel Special Forces shovel, I am ready for any emergency, be it earthquake, hurricane, or zombie apocalypse."
4,Good knife,"The SOG SEAL knife is a very good knife. The blade came with a decent edge on it. The sheath is very good quality. There is a plastic insert that the blade slides into. A couple things to mention...First, the knife is made in Taiwan. So if you want an American made knife skip this one. Second, the knife handle is a hard (Zytel). I don't know why, but I assumed the handle would have a little give to it. The checkering does help with the ability to grip the handle though. I'd like for the guard to be a little more prominent, just in case my hand ever slipped. The end of the tang meant for hammering won't help you out too much except for small things. It is only about a quarter inch thick. Overall this is a good knife that I would feel comfortable having with me in the field if I didn't have my KaBar."
3,Half and Half,"I'm not a huge fan of Fabric's Fabriclive series, but curiousity always gets the better of me and I end listening to whatever they put out anyhow.Initially, I was pleasantly surprised while listening to this album. Very eclectic and fun tracks from the world of urban beats. That was until the 9th track (The Nextmen - ""High Score"" (Stanton Warriors Remix)), and then the album just falls apart with cheesy or boring tracks till the end. Too bad.3/5 stars."
2,Interesting covers,"Most of the performances on this album are covers of well-known songs. I bought the album because I'm an old Saigon Kick fan. They cover ""Bodies"" by the Sex Pistols. The other covers by little-known musicians are okay. The performers stay true to the originals but customize the songs a bit. I'd say that this album is worthwhile only if you're a fan of any of the performers."
3,"This is a Kenda K161,",The sidewall says Kenda K161. I don't know why it's not sold as a Kenda. It only says Sunlite on the cardboard tag. I already have these tires and thought i was buying something different to replace them. The small knobbies tear easily in occassional offroad use. The carcass is easily damaged and will bulge in places and make you think your rim is bent. It is a 70 psi rated tire max. Very limited offroad use recommended but makes for a very aggressive city tire on an old ten speed. I would rate four stars in value but only gave it 3 for the deceptive labeling.
5,Great Fun With Big Numbers!,"I read this book to my son and daughter when they were 6 and 4 years old. They were, at the time, obsessed with big numbers, like billions, trillions, and more. They were fascinated with the concept of the number One Google, and this book's fun and detailed visuals were the perfect ""food"" to feed their hunger for numbers. A must-read for exploring math with your curious children."
3,Short and very sweet.,"This little book is cute, and about family and friends. The extra price for this book is because of it's high quality. There are only 16 pages, but they are glossy and a little thicker, wtih very nice illustrations to keep the child's attention. It is a short bedtime story type book to read to younger children. It is Christian based, and has good endings. It also has a family tree in the back that you can fill in. I got a copy from Freecycle, so the added savings was great."
5,I found a miracle drug.,"This supplement has brought me back to life. I was allways tired and slept a lot.The med took about 6-7 days to start working.I don't have an artificial wakefulness,just awake and more alert.My physician had no problem with me trying it and I would recommend that you speak to your physician first."
4,Good value,"I've had a noticeable improvement in mood since I started taking SAMe. These tablets work great, my only complaint is that they are a little large and somewhat difficult to swallow."
4,not a bad brand.,Brand is as good as any other known brand. Lot's more milligrams and tablets for the buck.
1,poor,"one of the boxes was not sealed,(potentialy dangerous) frustrated that the site on Amazon was so confusing that I decided to not return it.....will return if you can simplify the protocol...please"
1,Does not work,"I was really excited to read about the benefits of SAMe, only to find it didn't have any benefits at all. I took 400mg a day for 20 days. The only significance of taking it is, I broke my toe when I hit it on my desk. The odd part about that is I am always banging my toes on my desk."
3,Doesn't work,"I suspect those who are selling this product are also posting rave reviews to fool people like me to buy it. Don't fall for it. The stuff doesn't work, and in fact my perfectly good working knee joints started swelling up after taking SAM-E for 3 weeks. Now I have to purge my body of the poison and hopefully get full use of my joints back. Does it improve your mood like they tout? Nope...I hate life even more thanks to these con artist.***Update: please read my follow-up comments. Sam-E plus my reactions to wheat gluten that I was unaware of at the time may have been a factor with the joint issue. The depression was brought on by Celia disease and fixed after removing wheat from my diet.I changed 1 star to 3 because it may work for some people, but not for everyone."
2,Not impressed,I followed everyone's advice and bought this dictionary only to take it home and realize that it did not contain the two words I was looking for. I recommend checking out a couple of dictionaries before purchasing.
3,a little disappointed,"Save money and buy a benchmade knife for almost the same price. In general, the construction, grif etc., are better in a benchmade, you can see the quality."
3,"Adorable, but minimally fuctional","It's such a cute phone; I had this as a kid... However, as you can see, it's not exactly the most comfortable phone to use. To operate it, you have to hold the earpiece up and talk into Kermit's mouth. I kept it in my room as decoration, but when I wanted to call someone, I always used a different phone."
4,foo foo? NOT!,I'm just one of those ladies that refuses to dress her kids in outrageous foo foo outfits. So my solution? This simple BIB on top of a simple white outfit. That way my baby is comfortable during the christening and even during the reception.
1,????????,"I really haven't listened to much to this album. I don't think that it caught me, so it's on the stacks of ""selling on Amazon.com""."
1,Based on US policy,The only problem I see in these maps are that they have attempted to rename Middle eastern regions such as Persian Gulf to arabic names. I don't accept that.http://www.payvand.com/news/04/dec/1014.html
1,Terrible,"It's basically an atlas in PDF form spread out over eight CDs. You'll need glasses after scrolling in and out, trying to find anything. A waste of time and money."
1,What a horrible piece of software,"This is just a bunch of map scans, with absolutely horrible software access/navigation.The maps themselves are well-made, and if presented in a printed atlas, or with good navigation software, this would be a worthwhile product.But the nav. software is awful (as noted in other reviews), and feels like something from 1995. For the $20 or $30 this costs, you can buy a good printed atlas instead."
2,way too soulful and housey for my tastes,"I was hoping for something brash and soulless, and not so groovy, and more pounding. And less repetitive. Yes, this is extremely repetitive. Richie Hawtin takes some song that were pretty good by themselves, removes most of the music, and leaves you with crap that's only good on dancefloors where druggies who have no musical tastes can come. I'll give Mr. Hawtin one more chance, maybe with his Plastikman album, Closer.Because this is crap. Don't buy it. Unless you like gay house. Definitely, this is not techno."
5,This cd is too short....,"What can I say when I listen to this album. It is a truly moving experience. Richie Hawtin is without a doubt the best skilled DJ in the world. Of course there are many DJ's that are good at what they do, but few of them make me want to listen to their music at max volume. Seeing him live on his decks, efx, and 909 tour was so far the highlight of my underground music career. It was 2 1/2 hours of pure genius. His mix was flawless in every way. He is simply a robot. He is just a mechanical juggernaut of hard techno and is unphased when he stands behind a 909 machine and creates works of art. This cd is far too short. After playing it, you just want to hear more. It is the sheer essence of Richie Hawtin (although just a glimpse of what his is like live). Your collection is not complete unless you buy this album."
3,Interesting but nothing special,"Richie Hawtin has collected a vast array of hard techno tracks and brought them together in this compilation. His DJ sets are significantly different from his work as Plastikman in that Plastikman is much more atmospheric and darker, whereas these tracks (including the likes of Jeff Mills, Cristian Vogel, even Nitzer Ebb) are more straightforward banging techno. The only real problem of this disc is its novelty: it's interesting to hear a layering of tracks and how they relate, but I'd rather have a two disc set of continuous, longer tracks than one minute tracks that sound more like a short attention span problem. The 909 aspect is interesting as well but can be sometimes overpowering over the original recordings, and the EFX grow painfully obvious at times in their presence or lack thereof. It's not a bad collection by any means but fails to really hit the mark like his past work."
2,Snore,"Don't be swayed by his brilliant personal projects (R. Hawtin/Fuse/Plastikman, etc.) -- this is banging techno at it's most repetitive. After waiting six years after seeing Richie spin and perform live as Fuse and Cybersonik in 1992, I freaked when he came into my town for the Decks, Effects and 909 tour last year. His three-hour set (which closely reflects this album's body of music) was relentless -- oh yes, flawlessly mixed -- naturally (he is a knob tweaking crossfading professional), but lacking in the soul, spirit and creative genius behind his previous work.If you like trak after trak of *bangclikbanksmakbangbang* music that takes you down a long road to nowhere and back again, then this is your album. If not, check out some of his other albums, which feature the sounds that defined him."
1,Does NOT fit the older INTEX pools!!,I purchased this pump as a replacement for our Intex pool that we have had for the past 3 years. It is the recommended replacement pump but unfortunately Intex has changed the design of their pools since ours was made.I have rigged it to be used but was unable to attach it according to the instructions because the sides of our pool do NOT have the reinforced holes. The older pools had a short black tubing that slid into the white hoses.I just wanted to warn others of the mistake that I made by assuming that no major design changes had occurred with the Intex 16' pools.
2,worn out,"I bought this pump to replace the too small filter pump that came with our intex pool. It worked great for 2 months then the impeller disintigrated and I have not been able to get a replacement part. I guess the people at Intex think that no one is capable of removing for screws to remove and insert a new impeller. What a waiste of resources, to make a pump and expect it to be disposable after every season. I have had the pool for 3 years and have been through 3 filter pumps. In the long run it would have been more economical to spend a couple hundred dollars on a quality pump which has replacable parts."
2,Doesn't circulate water,"I have a 20X20X4 above ground pool, and this is the filter that came with it. It is not strong enough to pull the water through the vacuum hose. Also, my pool gets scummy on the far side from the pump/out and intake valves. I guess it's because it can;t circulate the water from that far away. When I shock treat it by putting the shock in the skimmer as recommended, I can see that the shock doesn't get to the other side of the pool. It's a disappointment because they sell this pump with the pool. I honestly think they ought to sell a more powerful unit. I had an old intex pool that I bought a number of years ago and finally replaced because the plastic parts and pump dry-rotted. It was fantastic, and the pump was much bigger, even though it was only an 18 foot pool. I think Intex has gotten 'cheaper' with the pump they supply."
2,Krystal Clear?? QUESTIONABLE,This does not work at all as well as my smaller filter did.Had to Buy the skimmer attachment parts extra. It clogs up at the intake grids and impairs the flow. The cartrige has had to be replaced in less than a week of use. my little filter that came with the pool kept my pool chrystal clear. This filter just cloggs up daily. I finally have had to put a Knee high stocking over my skimmer basket and am hoping that works to keep the floating dibree out of the grids. A filter is for getting that dibree floating and this one doesn't. I am NOT at All HAPPY with This Filter of that is what it can be called.
2,doesnt last long,my intex 1500 pool pump lasted less than 6 months. my first pump lasted less than 1year. pump does agood job pumping and filtering water but they do not last very long. im very disappointed with my purchase
1,"Works, but just barely","Had an Intex 1000GPH whose impeller went bad after 2 months but with no receipt, no warranty. Bought this as an upgrade for better function. Of course, different pump, so the connections don't fit. Buy the accompanying hoses, but for whatever reason Intex doesn't put inline valves on their pumps so you can change/clean the filter without having to pick th epump up above the waterline. Buy the hose adaptors to install shutoff valves. Finally get the pump installed a month or two later and I'm pretty sure they sold me a remanufactured unit. It's as loud as my old pump when the impeller broke and it doesn't flow nearly as much water as the 1000GPH it replaced. Don't get me wrong, it does technically work, but if it's flowing 1500GPH then my old pump must've been a 2500GPH. Tried contacting the seller twice with no response."
3,INTEX 1500 GPH POOL PUMP,PUMP WAS REASONLY PRICE BUT CAN TELL IT IS CHEAPLY MADE.THIS IS THE 2ND PUMP I HAVE BOUGHT IN TWO YEARS.PRODUCT WAS SENT IN REASONABLE TIME. AND WELL PRICED.
5,more than I hoped for,"I'm verry happy with my selection. Pool was sold with under-sized pump. That is what the sellers always do. I replaced an 800 gph pump with this one. I works so well in my 1000 gal pool I can see the motion of the water both at the surface, and through-out the pool.I've had it 3 weeks now and I has keep the pool water clear without stressing the motor on the pump."
1,Do NOT be tempted to run this without a GFCI !,"At the beginning of the second season of use, this unit kept tripping the GFCI. When I took the cover off the pump, it was apparent why. Thank God we had it plugged into a GFCI because the housing for the motor had 3 stress cracks in it which was allowing water to enter the electrical components. I also noted the same complaint with the the impeller fins being broken. I did not order this particular model as a replacement but upgraded to a 2500gph unit. Hopefully it will be a more durable system. I will, however, always be careful to use a GFCI outlet."
4,"It's staples, what can you say...","Exactly as described and work great. Turns out 3/4"" is a LOT of pages, I probably should have only gone with the 1/2"" since that would have be plenty long for everything I've done so far..."
4,All About Particles: A Handbook of Japanese Function Words,"This book is a very good reference for the Intermediate student. The example sentences and kanji are too advanced for a beginner and the romaji is an insult to advanced students.It helps a great deal if you sit down and read the entire book once, and then put it up on your shelf and only look in it when you encounter a new particle. While it claims to be a handbook, it is more of a dictionary, but nevertheless it is good if you need a quick reminder.I recommend buying this book along with Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns by Naoko Chino for maximum effect. The book does no attempt in teaching anything about the example sentences, only the particles."
4,Good book for particles,This book gives you many examples about how to use the different participles particles but you should take care not to let yourself be overwhelmed by the number of different ways to use a particle. baby steps!
1,Get the other book by the author (see review),"You get information about 69 particles organised alphabetically. Book is quite basic. Several sentence examples for each entry, but the usage comments are not that extensive. The alphabetical organisation makes it sometimes hard to see related to particles.Book is written in 1991, but I suppose the particles haven't changed that much in the last 20 years.Skip this book. Consider the following 2005 book by the same author instead:How to Tell the Difference between Japanese Particles: Comparisons and Exercises. It actually has slightly fewer particles, but it is organised topically instead of alphabetically. This makes for a much better learning experience.If you want a book that covers a larger number of particles I would definitely go for this general grammar instead:A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar"
2,It's Ok,"I used this book for my japanese and this book is ok. For me I thought, it was really easy to forget the particles and it doesn't really stick out in your mind. It's more of a here's the particle and the sentence that's it. I thought her other book The Difference between Particles is way better because it also has english translation like what it translates to english for example kara= from. I thought it was more easier to remember the particles overall I recommned her other book.How to Tell the Difference between Japanese Particles: Comparisons and Exercises<--- This book is way better"
3,Not for Beginners,"I'm a beginner in Japanese. This is a comprehensive book meant for more advanced learners. The sentences in the examples are too complicated. Right off the bat, the author uses multiple particles in long sentences. It's difficult to understand why those particles are used in certain situations. Maybe I'll find the book more useful as a reference in the future when I gain a better grasp of Japanese. Meanwhile, ""Japanese Sentence Patterns for Effective Communication: A Self-Study Course and Reference"" by Taeko Kamiya is much easier for beginners to follow and understand."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was completely disappointed in this book. While artistically designed, it didn't capture the lowcountry I love. Wish I hadn't purchased this book. Will probably donate to the library."
1,disappointing,"Can't express how disappointed we were after reviewing this book. It is not photos, we expected presenting the old/new SOUTH, but almost avantgard, abstract over/under exposed images.( too dark, too light ).Don't waste the money on it...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT..."
4,Don't let the cover make you pass on this one.,"In a detached, sometimes bitter, but rarely boring narrative Cecil gives us a tour of his teenage life in his podunk town life in Bricksburg,(the eerie coincidence to Williamsburg is rather humorous)VA.The big mystery is who defaced the town historic sign, but Cecil is trying to understand his world.His insane aunt thinks he is an astronaut, his friend Isaac is an eccentric painter and Isabel brings Cecil the truth in a kiss. Cecil's thought and words are a treat!"
2,Jenson's Review of Cecil in Space,"Cecil In Space is the average story about a 17 years old named Cecil discovering himself. He lives in the small town of Bricksburg, Virginia, and we get a good understanding of his life. This book is pretty typical a mediocre story.At times I felt Hite was trying just to hard to appeal to a young audience. The results are boring scripture and over the top narrative that seems to turn off many young women. The only thing I liked about this story was Cecil's Aunt June. She's a very lively character who lives in a mental institution.Overall, this book is just...ok. It feels rushed and incomplete. I don't recommend this book for anyone, but people desperate for a quick book report might want to check this out. They should probably be mature young readers ages 12-15 due to mild language and sexual inuendo."
2,Cecil and I didn't hit it off very well.,"I was very excited to read this book because I had read such great things about it on Amazon, but when I finally got to read it I didn't like it. The plot was barely there. I didn't feel any connection with the main character. I also felt the dialogue wasn't believable."
5,OuT oF tHiS WoRlD....,"I say this because, I thought that this book was full of pure entertainment. I found that there were many similarities and differences that I had with Cecil (main character). The way he looked out on his life, where he lives, and how he described it is just like me. Cecil used a plentiful amount of sarcasism,humour,and range of vocabulary. I definetly recommend you people out there to read this... you will not regret it if you like crazy and outrageous kind of writing."
5,Full marks for all the songs,I heard a few songs on Pandora and decided to buy it.It's well worth the money. I really love the slow rock indie style. Very unique. All the songs are great. They have a very unique style. Nice listening for a lazy afternoon.Just preview it on Amazon before you buy.Highly recommended.
4,MDC returns in original form,"I have to admit, I tend to like MDC's more humor based, or free ranging side. My favorite tracks on this are ""Ballad of G.W.,"" ""Sick of It,"" ""Prick Faced Bastard"" (all three a bit more humor based), and ""Timmy Yo"" (a mellow tune, with great punk scene commentary). A lot of the faster tracks remind me of very early MDC, which is no wonder, because it is the original line-up. It's cool to see they can still move at that speed. Not a favorite release of mine because I lean towards like their more experiemental tracks, I'd still give it a 4, because this is what punk was meant to be, not the self-indulgent ""sing about me, or my girlfriend, or how I'm bored"" or whatever other crap passes as punk nowadays."
3,Good information -- Poor editing,"The information content in this book makes it well worth the price. I bought it because I am using the technique in my research and thought it might provide some good references and possibly some pointers on applications. It did that. Unfortunately, this important contribution is marred by bad editing and poor English usage. Almost every chapter contains what I can only assume are mistranslated words and confusing sentence structure. The book could have benefited greatly from an English-speaking copy editor."
1,What brand of Christianity is this?,"Prosperity is not promised by the genuine Christian faith. Jesus promised abundant life, but that life was often found in the context of great personal suffering and sacrifice. The apostle Paul, for example, was shipwrecked, stoned, chased out of cities, bitten by a snake...all as a result of his faithful ministry. He found no promise of money or traditional success, but instead lived with an undeafeatable joy...the kind of joy that comes not from transient earthly riches, but from deep relationship with the living God. I would encourage Reverend Davis to reread the gospels of the Bible...the story of the rich young ruler, the beatitudes...and finally the cross. Jesus' kingdom is not built of gold or power, but of love and faithfulness."
5,Spray and Wash,I've had 4 Carpel Tunnel surgeries. The aresol can is the only way for me to go. I can't find it in the stores. These folks are so reliable! I order a case every year. They are very prompt in shipping. Doing business with them is great! I recomend them highly. On a scale of 1-10.........I'd give them a 12! Debbie
1,Must wash clothes within 5 minutes of using spray!,"I was under the assumption that the aerosol version of Spray 'n Wash would be the same as the stick version. Wrong! With the aerosol spray, you have only 5 minutes to spray the item(s) and then get them into the washing machine. For a busy mom who is often interrupted, that is not an easy task.I find it much easier to apply the Spray 'n Wash stick to the laundry as the items are being put into the hamper. That way, I'm not standing there on laundry day going through the dirty clothes piece by piece while I hunt for stains.If you do decide to try this version, consider yourself lucky to have been forewarned. It was only after I got my clothes out of the dryer and noticed that none of the stains had been removed, that I actually read the tiny instructions on the can that say ""wash within 5 minutes.""I suggest the original stick version, which you can get atReckitt Benckiser 4.3Oz Spray-N-Wash Stick 62338-00006."
5,Godzilla - Final Wars DVD,I have watched most (if not ALL) of the Godzilla movies over the years. I have at least 2 on DVD. In this one Godzilla ROCKS. What a movie to be the last in the Godzilla saga. Although I do hope there are more.
2,"Mediocre book, bad condition","For the price, this is a toughie to swallow. The content seems ok, but don't be suprised when you get a flimsy paperback in the mail.But, more importantly, my copy (bought ""New"" from Amazon directly) came with a bent front cover and what looks like skin-oil stains through the inside. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to exchange the book before class started."
2,ok...,"The show is just too fiction unlike X-Men:Evolution, but the actions awesome as well.But was trying to find some romance/drama here but just couldn't./"
1,Do not buy this or any other set,"These DVDs continue to be bitter disappointments. They crop the image, they only put 3 on a CD, and they release them sporadically. This is the last one I will ever buy - I just got a DVD burner and I'll burn new episodes. For old episodes, just head over to ebay, there are some wonderfully produced bootleg sets out there. I just dropped $70 for seasons 1&2 - gorgeous case, menus, high quality widescreen, and even bonus features. It could have been Time-Warner's $70, but they continue to be stupid and greedy about their DVD sets."
3,"Not Rated ""G"" as discribed.","I purchased this video for my 3 year old son. It was the only super hero video rated ""G"" though amazon's description. After reading the reviews from people with younger children, I decided to purchase it. Once I recieved it, the video stated ""PG"" (not G as it did on amazon)I am sure this is a great video for older children, but I think the language and ""fighting evil"" is two old for my 3 year old... maybe when he is 6 or 7."
3,Where's the season box set?,"I can't believe that WB is taking a step back like this. I love that they have been able to release a boxed set for the different seasons of their other shows such as Batman the Animated series and Justice League. What's up with these single disc releases for Justice League Unlimited? It's a shame. If you like the show, you should wait until they get smart and realse a boxed set."
4,Review with a Plea,"As I want to do the episodes on this DVD justice, I give it 4 stars. These are some of the better, although not the best, episodes this incarnation of Justice League cartoons has to offer. That being said, I must add my voice to those who call for season-by-season boxes of both ""The Justice League"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"". Many of my favorite installments of both shows remain unavailable much to my chagrin. C'mon Warner! Please wise up!"
1,NOT FOR KIDS!!!,"I bought this DVD for my 4 1/2 year old son. We were watching it together and at first I found it a bit violent, a lot of talk about killing and dying. My son loves superheroes and after two minutes it wnet into Superman's dream sequence where he was in bed with a woman, his wife. It was morning and they started talking about the sex they had had the night before and how he couldn't come. She said ""I couldn't have gotten you off if I had thrown a bomb in this bed."" Is that dialogue for a 4 year old??? If there is blatant adult content in this video why does it say ""DC COmics Kids Collection"" across the top??? Just one more reason to make sure you know what your kids are watching. IT is also way too violent for young kids. THis is NOT ""Superfriends."""
1,Question,"Hi all. I have been hearing your discontent as to the fact that there are no full JL box sets being released. My boyfriend's bday is coming up and he is a huge fan, so I was wondering if anyone could suggest which JL DVD's to get instead? I saw something on this site about Kozak selling the first two seasons... All help is much appreciated. Thanks! Lillian"
4,is it uncut?,I watched it on cartoonetwork and I think they edited out some stuff.. just asking if its uncutso could somebody tell me
1,"Great episodes, v bad release",Containing only 3 episodes on FULLSCREEN format & not in episode order I just cant understand what is going on with Warner Home Video. The 3 episodes on this DVD releases are v v good but then the extras and the episode quantity & order are such a big let down. The cover art on the DVD is wrong as well since Green Lantern & Superman got both revamped designs!Why they keep on doing this cheap stuff I cant understand. Hurry up and release the box sets for God's sake!
3,What The Hecks Up with These Releases?,"I have all but one of the previous releases of Justice League. It's getting very tiresome to be waiting 4-6 months for a measly 3 episodes. At least when they were releasing episodes from the first two seasons, they were including 4 episodes. And even Teen Titans has 6 per disc. Come on WB.... Release season sets. My rating was in the middle, because despite the crappy releases, this is still one of the best cartoons currently on tv. There hasnt been an episode I didnt like. But, the releases are a joke. Someone commented on two of the characters on the cover not even being updated to their third season appearance. Well.. .was Aquaman even in any of the episodes on this disc? I am thinking he wasnt, so why is he on the cover art? I hope this is the last release like this and next time we see new Justice League DVDs, in season set form."
5,Clever writing,"This is no SuperFriends. The stories and dialog have enough in jokes and secondary comic characters to make this a better than average cartoon show. I read DC comics when I was a child and didn't see the characters for over 20 years, yet the show reminded me that I read stories of Booster Gold, Red Tornado, Hal Jordan/Green Latern. Even if you don't know the characters the stories are enjoyable. I also prefer the more realistic animation to the Titans/LSH style."
5,Fabulous,My daughter is 6 and has enjoyed the Backyardigans for 2 years without driving her father out of the house! The material is terrific -- musical theater for kids.
2,Not as good as Movers & Shakers,"We loved Movers & Shakers...the storylines and the music were so much more creative than ""Into the Deep"". I was pretty disappointed in the quality of the writing of this one."
3,cute but dirty,"I bought this as a gag stocking stuffer for my husband... we call each other similar names to Bop and Beep... anyway, it arrived sooner than expected but it's dirty. It looks like it was sitting on a dusty shelf for a while. It wasn't wrapped in plastic like you would expect, just stuffed into an envelope. It's a super cute toy and it looks like it would be very durable but you might have to wash it before you give it to someone as a gift."
5,Great knife. Sharp.,This is a cool looking knife. It is very sharp and usable. Very happy with my purchase. Would highly recommend.
3,Slightly disappointed,"Was very excited to get this knife based on reviews read. Extremely disappointed to find out that the knife is indeed Made In Taiwan. Not sure If i will even keep it based on this fact. I looked everywhere online and everything said country of origin was USA. This needs to be important to more people. Blade is very sharp and the sheath seems ok. Handle is in question as would be much better in rubber, the plastic seems chinsy and odd to grip with big hands.."
4,Great knife for your pistol holster.,"The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol. This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster. Held its edge, the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet, this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments."
4,Great knife,Overall this knife is pretty solid. It seems unbreakable. Could have been sharper and I wish it had a slightly larger blade.
3,Somewhat expensive for what you get.,"I bought the Sealpup for use as a dive knife, and after a year of use have this to say about the knife.-The original sheath isn't the most comfortable in use. Doesn't seem to fit the knife that well.-The phosphate finish on the blade isn't as corrosion resistant as I had expected. Not much better than a typical stainless steel blade. However, the blade keeps it's edge extemely well.-The handle doesn't grip as well as other knives when wet.Overall, I'm not sure it's performance justifies the relatively high price this knife costs."
3,A nice solid knife!,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design, it was sharp out of the package, but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small, if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle, it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
2,seal pup small for survival use.,I found the seal pup to be small. It would work as a back up or for light camping. The sheath is great except for the extra pouch on the front either put something in it or leave it off. I find it to be a waste of space.
4,"Great Grip, Super Sharp Blade.","With knives at this price level, you want something sturdy and reliable, and not much flash. You get those features with this knife. Like most SOG Products, this one delivers. It is the right size for an adult hand without being cumbersome. This knife, however, is not for concealment. I bought it for a trip to Asia. It wasn't very popular with the Park Police in Cambodia. I had to keep it in my pack. That is the only take away from the knife, the sheath is pretty bulky. But I guess the people who it is made for in name (SEALS) don't care about concealed or not."
3,so rich,"you will only need a dab for entire face and neck, so in that sense it is good value for money (will last you a year).however, i recommend you ask for a tester before you buy the whole thing.i found out it irritates my skin pretty bad only after i bought it :(. no rash, no redness, just ""itchy"" feeling that lasts all day.really annoying and too bad for me."
3,Who doesn't love a good potato?,"Potatoes are cheap, good for you, have a long (refrigerator) shelf life, and the potential to be very tasty. While many of these recipes don't appeal to the educated palate, they probably taste just fine to people who think chikcen tenders are real food. And in that group, the majority are teens and 20-somethings. Because these recipes are pretty straightforward and don't call for a lot of exotic ingredients, they are just that much more appealing to our young people. Throw in a gift card to a grocery store and you've got a great graduation, birthday, or other holiday gift for your favorite 20-something who's recently left home and gone out on his own. 50 Ways to Leave Your Mother"
4,Just staples,Im happy to say that the staples work but stippling the papers together... I mean... these are staples... there is no need to read a review on staples. Especially if you already own the staplers that they are used for (which is a beast. Best $20 I've ever spent!!! :-D...)
4,It's a box of staples! What's to review?,The title says it all. I bought a box of staples for the electric stapler I recently bought. No more no less
4,Smooth and durable sander,I have owned this half sheet sander for 2 years now and it is still going strong. I have used it to sand large areas such as steps and floors. This sander runs very smooth and has very little noise for a sander. The unit is constructed of all metal so it can take the bumps along the way. I also purchaced the attachment for collecting dust and it really helps to keep the dust down to a minimum. Paper change is a snap also. Another great product from Porter-Cable!
5,Can Live,"If you like Can you will love this album, especially the '72 gig. This is the most interesting live record I have ever heard. Excellent."
2,Fundamentally flawed,"While this book may seem like a wonderful introduction to various distilleries in Scotland, this book is fundamentally flawed. Mr. Wishart gives an overview of the general flavor of a distillery, but distilleries produce many different malts with a variety of flavor! One cannot classify a distillery on their most popular bottling alone. Pick up anything by Michael Jackson or Charles Maclean and learn what a really whisky writer is all about."
5,A history of production methods rounds out a fascinating course for any who even casually enjoy whisky.,"WHISKY CLASSIFIED: CHOOSING SINGLE MALTS BY FLAVOUR isn't just for the avid whisky pro: it cuts out the jargon and provides an easy survey for newcomers, too, identifying twelve dimensions to the aroma and taste of a single malt whiskey and covering the distilleries of Scotland. Each distillery receives a description, the author'' own tasting notes, and explanations of taste. A history of production methods rounds out a fascinating course for any who even casually enjoy whisky.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Whiskey book review,"This book just classifies the different whiskies to region, taste, color etc. Does really rate the whiskies. Also the whiskies rated are the most inexpensive, and there isn't much depth in the selection.This book is for the beginner. Michael jackson's books are much better."
2,Not Worth It...,"I like the style of Thimbleberries - so much so that I have all books that they've released. It is for this reason that I'm so disappointed with this book. It is just a compilation of design ideas and quilt patterns that have already been published by Landauer Books under four or five other titles. After waiting for new ideas, this is what we get? It's the same as the ""Collection of Classic Quilts"" and ""Best of Thimbleberries"" books - re-releasing previously published patterns to make more money. At least the newest flannel book has 'some' new patterns in it. If you have any of the other Thimbleberries books published by Landauer, you won't be missing anything if you pass this book by."
1,No Patterns,I bought this book thinking that since its subject matter was country decor using quilts that there would actually be quilt patterns included. No such luck.
3,quilt book maybe???,If you are looking for a Thimbleberry book of quilts.. this is NOT it. Mixed in are a few quilt ideas.. but the bulk of the book relates to other ideas.
1,Disappointed Quilter,This is not what I expected. No new ideas just a rehash of previous ones. I feel as if I have wasted my money. Certainly wasn't worth the money spent. If you are looking for new ideas for your quilting look elsewhere.
1,Terribly disappointing,"The photos in this book look as if they were taken in the 1980s. The whole book looks dated, and it's filled with country clichés. I've seen all these ideas zillions of times and done most of them myself in the past. What I wanted were some fresh new country ideas, n ot this kind of a rehash of country style from 20 years ago."
5,A wonderful chronicle of the Dominic LeVay era of Nosferatu,"This album is simply wonderful. Only gripe: the ENTIRE "" Lord of Flies "" track list should have been included! That being said, this is a great compilation of Nosferatu from "" Prince of Darkness "" on; with Nosferatu's OTHER excellent vocalist Dminic LeVay ( the best being Louis DeWray, who has now rejoined the band.) Two unreleased gems "" The Night is Young "" and "" Luficer Rising "" are worth the price alone! HIGHLY recomended."
4,PLEASED,"Recieved bike in like 4 days, before I expected it (GREAT). The bikes were not hard to put together, the quality of the bike is great for what it cost.Its not the best or the worst just an all around good bike to ride around the neighbor hood."
2,"The Final Years New York, Ontario & Western","a good first book on the old and weary railroad. this book gives you a taste of trains that ran. The connection to other NY state railroad, the stations. From Oswego in the north to Jersey city in the south with connections to Scranton. Anybody looking to model parts of the line will apprecaite the yard diagrams. Steam and diesel shots are here NYO&W was one of the first in NY to dieselize but with little luck."
5,FINALLY AVAILABLE!!!,"This is a deliciously neurotic film about Margo, and her relationships, tracked by two friends who were also both married to her at one time or another. Margo not only left her men broken hearted, but also got the dogs in each settlement. We get reoccurring glimpses of Margo walking an ever growing pack of canines as the movie progresses. This movie is edgy, redeeming, and also, via a cameo appearance, gives the viewer a chance to remember and say goodbye to Payne Stewart, who was both a remarkable man and golfer. I say buy it now. I can't ever imagine this film getting a negative review. When this film showed on IFC, people stopped each other on the street the next day to talk about how enjoyable it was."
2,A disappointment,"At first I thought this would be a fairly good mix of GB's work but after listening a couple times it's not anywhere near as good to listen to as ""The George Benson Collection"" that I had on 2 cassettes. It was short on material from his breakout albums ""Breezin'"" and ""In Flight"" from the mid-'70's. If you can't find the GB Collection on CD, I'd suggest either buying great condition LP's or cassettes and burn your own. I'm going to sell the CD. Note: This is an import album and might be more geared to either Latin or European rather than American tastes."
1,Stanley Bostitch Saddle Stapler,"Within less than 30 minutes after receiving two of these staplers, we had contacted the seller to advise that they were malfunctioning and literally chewing up our booklets as we tried to staple them. We sent them back and purchased one Stanley Swingline stapler (because it was twice the price)which has been worth the extra cost."
2,Not quite as good as expected,"I just bought this exact same knife from a department store. I was impressed that it was so cheap for a knife that has a blade made from 440C stainless steel. Out of the box the blade was not terribly sharp (could be sharpened easily but should have a razor factory edge in my opinion). The handle was lightweight, but felt and looked cheap, as well as borderline flimsy. The blade was not smooth or quick in opening and the liner lock device is thin. The blade also had a lot of play from side to side while open and locked. I promptly returned the knife as I felt that is was too cheaply made for everyday carry. If you want a knife at a cheap price and don't plan on using it for any serious activities then this might be the knife for you. As for me, I am going to take a pass on this model."
3,"Beautiful knife, not so functional.","I got one of these as a gift. It's a fantastic LOOKING knife and fairly lightweight. However, it's hard to sharpen (not factory sharp at all...coating on the edge? Who does that?). The titanium coating is a nice mirror black. Blade is very tight, not a one hand. Handle is well crafted and comfortable.Can't expect too much from a cheap knife. It looks good but I wouldn't trust it for everyday use without significant modification."
3,Typical Kalas,"This book is great for Sunday Schools or small groups. He uses bible verses about Christmas to guide the book. Each chapter opens with particular verses about one aspect of the Christmas Story. His analysis is really good. No matter what your background I think this book will open your mind to Christmas. You will at least once have an ""awe yes"" moment while you read this book. He will get your mind turning for sure. The only reason I gave it three stars is because compared to his other books it has less ""awe yes"" moments than Kala's fans would expect. It will for sure give you a new tool to take a look at Christmas with."
2,A Tesla Turbine Scrapbook,"This book is a scrapbook reprinting what appears to be everything the editor could find written about Tesla Turbines. If you are seeking reprints of Tesla turbine patent applications and circa 1911 newspaper and magazine articles, this book is a great collection.I was somewhat disappointed, hoping to find higher-level engineering technical information. Several reprinted articles do have some tidbits of technical information. Unfortunately, the same few tidbits are scattered through the various articles in the book over and over."
1,Maxi-Aids Talking Microwave Oven,"I would caution anyone from buying this or any product from Maxi-Aids. The unit was defective as delivered, right out of the box. Amazon indicated I needed to work directly with Maxi-Aids for return/exchange. Maxi-Aids refuses to accept either and indicated I have to contact the manufacturer directly (4th party) to arrange repair. The unit is originally a Magic Chef (5th party), which apparently gets modified by a 4th party manufacturer and distributed by Maxi-Aids. You get the original Magic Chef operating instructions (which are of no value) and a short set of instructions typed on 8 1/2 x 11 paper. Notionally, it could be a good product, but if there are any issues, you are on your own. Maxi-Aids will not support their products."
3,Tiana Lemnitz,"Devotees of great singing, and of German sopranos in particular, should not overlook Tiana Lemnitz (1897-1994), one of the finest singers of her time. Those wanting to sample and hear what all the fuss was about are best advised to listen to recordings she made earlier in her career than those found on this CD, which date from 1942-1953. The creamy tone, the firm breath control, and the unique vocal timbre are still evident, but the voice tends to spread uncomfortably at times. Her earlier versions of most of the tracks found here are the ones to go for. Those who want to have everything she recorded will not necessarily be disappointed with this CD, however. I enjoyed the Letter Scene from ""Eugene Onegin"" and several of the duets, although she and Franz Volker are surely too loud for the bridal couple in ""Lohengrin"". The sound quality of these recordings, many made in war-torn Germany in the 1940s, is astonishingly good."
3,Innamoramento,This is only the second Mylene Farmer album I have heard. The first was Anamorphosée which was great. Innamoramento disappointed me. I agree with Christian Turk's review even though I am not a Farmer fan.
5,"Perfect, as always...","Mylene releases an album every 2 or 3 years, and each and every one is a perfectly polished gem. Innamoramento and L'Amour Naissant have an incredible emotional and musical momentum. Mylene's voice is only getting better as years go by, music is great... 100% recommended."
5,one of the most beautiful french cds,"the reviews for this cd are very helpful, thanks to all of the reviewers. i love the song ""Je te rends ton amour""."
5,A great knife!!,"Wow! I absolutely love this knife. I collect knives and this is one of my favorites. It opens up very easily with one hand. The steal ATS-34 blade is extremely strong and razor sharp. Plus, the design of the blade and handle is fantastic. SOG is a great knife company!"
5,"Feels great in the hand, opens easy","Love this knife! It's been over a year - maybe two and I still carry this guy around with me. Very sharp, excellent weight. Makes a nice metal on metal tap noise when opened with a flick."
4,"Comprehensive, Concise Lexicon of the Blues","This alphabetically arranged Lexicon helps readers to make sense of the dizzying list of blues artists who have contributed to thise body of music. The book is fairly broad and includes many crossover type bands (blues derivation of Rock, for example), with a brief history and list of essential recordings from each artist.I expected the book to be somewhat more ""readable"" rather than a catalogue of artists; however, it is useful as the latter. You will not be disappointed with the volume, and you will probably pull it out frequently when shopping for blues music, reviewing artists heard on public radio's blues shows, or when browsing the internet for non-copyrighted blues recordings (many of the oldest recordings are in public domain).The price also makes it worthwhile. If it guides you toward a single, more satisfying blues recording (or helps you avoid a single stinker), then it's paid for itself."
4,Very informative but really!,"A very good book loaded with info. Major quibble with the omission of Chuck Berry. Was he uncooperative or is it possible to just forget about Chuck? Artists are clearly reviewed by people who like them and the ratings reflect this. Maybe it is the way to go, but it's bizzare to find anything by Stevie ""Guitar"" Miller rated higher good albums from Muddy, Big Joe Williams, etc. etc. etc. A Herculean job to be sure, but the flaws stick in the craw."
4,Fine mix CD,"This is a great mix. It just doesn't stop from beginning to end. As far as I'm concerned Heather can do no wrong. The only reason I gave this mix four stars and not five is because I've listened to ""Tangerine"" over and over and over. ""Tangerine"" defines modern house music. I think it even beats the hell out of Farina's ""SF Sessions"".I don't think Heather will ever best what she did with ""Tangerine"", which is actually saying a lot. She set the bar pretty high.On a side note, after listening to this mix, Hipp-E and Halo, and Craig Richards all put out by Fabric, I can say that I thoroughly trust Fabric's taste. They put out some great stuff, and I will certainly buy Fabric productions in the future."
3,Failed potential,"The Cure for Death by Lightning has so much potential that, for me, is never fulfilled. What a great start! The writing, the imagery, the rhythms, the characters all sucked me into the vortex that was a languid small town in British Columbia in WW II. But then, such a letdown! It seems that the Gail Anderson-Dargatz tried so hard to create unusual and interesting characters that she forgot what to do with them. According to the jacket blurb of the copy that I have, The Cure for Death by Lightning was prompted by a short story the author had written earlier. And I think here is the problem. She tries to stretch a good short story into a novel, thereby leaving it somewhat threadbare."
4,deserves the spotlight,I'm pleased to see others here who discovered this book...This is one of my favorite debut novels ever. I was captivated and read it slowly so it wouldn't end as soon. I'm going to reread it!
1,The Cure for Death by Boredom,"Our book club selected this book on the basis of its upbeat book cover, thinking that this would be an uplifting book. Boy, were we ever wrong! Just shows you can't judge a book by its cover. We thought the author went overboard by trying to cover all the ""hot"" topics, e.g., incest, lesbianism, murder, beastiality, Turette's Syndrome, etc...etc...Yawn. Thank goodness the chapters were brief because every new chapter provided the reader with some new horrendous insight. All in all, we all agreed that you couldn't pay us enough to read her next book!"
2,"weak, reductionist, yet a page-turner","I was extremely disappointed with ""A Cure for Death by Lightning."" Although I found the book hard to put down, I felt the writing was weak. Mainly, I was stunned by the fact that the terrible dysfunctions of the town and of the family were minimalized, reduced to nothing more than the ever-present (too much present, agonizingly so) ""coyote spirit"". Are we to believe that the father was not to blame for his abusive behavior, that the horrid boy Parker was simply possessed by the coyote, that Billy didn't have terret syndrome after all? The coyote lurked all through the pages of this book, far too often. The coyote stood in the way of dealing with real and gripping issues. To deal with those issues in a realistic manner would have made for a much more compelling book. I understand the author wanted to use some sort of mystic symbolism and magic realism, but sadly, this didn't work to entice, but rather, to frustrate."
1,A bad book,"I am not complaining about a novel dealing with grim issues. That is a perfectly good thing for a novel to do. But Anderson-Dargatz seems to throw any controversial subject in just for the hell of it. Lesbianism, insanity, rape, bestiality - this novel has it all! And she does a bad job of dealing with those issues too. For example, the main character's father becomes incredibly and dangerously mentally unstable. He becomes violent and hot-tempered, when previously he had been a good father and husband. Anderson-Dargatz writes about the fear he generates, but there is no sense that his family members would and should *miss* the man he used to be. Beth doesn't ever seem to miss her father. Likewise, her mother doesn't ever seem to miss her husband. He's a monster now, and that's that. ""Shallow"" is the word that springs to mind."
4,Being and Vibration,"Rael's book is filled with powerful energy; the words themselves may be elusive, even hard to understand at times, but that's because they contain the power of an alternate frame of reference. Just reading this book shifted my center and my life."
5,Being and Vibration,Being and Vibration is so wonderful that I am now buying it for friends. Reading a paragraph or a page can send me into a meditative state.
2,They're Staples!,"I mean: they're staples!These staples are fine, but I hate the stapler they are for. It seems to only work very well with a very specific number of pages: too few and the staple forms itself into a dangerous weapon, too many and no holding together of the paper. This is true of any stapler, but the optimal range of this stapler is too small."
5,Work as they should,"These staples work as staples should work. What can a guy say about a staple other than that you put them in the machine, press the bar, and they work."
2,THE STING ON A DOWNER,"Imagine THE STING set in a contemporary slum, taken very seriously, with a no name cast, and with a downbeat ending---cause that's what this movie amounts to.For whatever reason, it's filmed in Philadelphia, though there's nothing special about the location shooting. The direction comes off as lacklaster, even amaturish. The plot does move fast, though.Somehow, Universal released this; AIP was better with such material. A very 1970s movie, also kinda akin to ACROSSS 11OTH STREET, with a similar mafia/cops chasing anti-heros angle.This movie and the book it adapted from came out before THE STING----so, THE STING ripped off the opening scene of two hustlers accidently ripping off the mafia!!!!"
4,Confusion,The battery works fine so far. I got it in just a few days after ordering. The only problem was that I wasn't quite sure of what I was to receive. The picture showed 5 batteries and the caption said:**PHOTO IS WRONG** you will get 1pc. SONY Brand CR2025 >>Buy 2 Get 1 FREE<< - Genuine SONY BRAND Factory SEALED - Free Upgrade to 1st Class Shipping - THE SELLING PRICE WAS REDUCED TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT AMAZON'S SHIPPING OVERCHARGE - Everything is Guaranteed or Simply Return It in the Same Conditon for a Complete Refund.I supppose that if I order another one and pay another $4.99 shipping they will send me 2 more.
4,A workout you don't have to dread!,"No matter how much you may love to exercise, there are just those days when you find yourself less-than-enthusiastic about dragging out your step. THIS is the video for those days -- a good, solid, fun workout that doesn't leave you exhausted and ready to climb back into bed. Gin Miller's cueing and instruction are top notch, the music is funky and the set is fun in a way that is relaxing rather than distracting. The moves are varied and easy to follow so they keep your attention. I own all of the videos in the Step Reebok series and this is still one of my favorites. Give yourself a break from high intensity step routines and enjoy this workout guilt- and dread-free!"
2,Slow Stepping,"The only gripe I have about this video is that the music was very slow. The choreography was interesting, the cueing was very good...and the transitions between combinations was very smooth. The music just wasn't inspiring or fast enough for my personal tastes...but I did sweat and was sore the next day.. Anyone familiar with step could do this video."
4,it's good,"i bought this video after becoming bored with kathy smith. although kathy is a sweet lady she usually repeats alot of the same moves in all her videos. anyway, i was glad i bought this one. the moves weren't hard and the routine and music are pretty cool, although i'm at the threshold of burnout and usually just blast my own music over it (to improve motivation) gin is great."
4,A nice solid workout...,"Gin Miller and Reebok have created the best step videos around. This is not my favorite, but it's a good solid workout with plenty of moves. I did not get bored easily (which is my complaint with other videos like Kathy Smith). In fact, I was so frustrated with this one when I first saw it that I put it away for a month before attempting it again. After I tried it again and got the moves down pat, it's now one I do at least once a week with my others. Gin uses the floor as much as she uses the step, but it's still a good solid 45 min. workout. A nice addition to Reebock's step videos....."
3,"Too much Aerobics, Too little Step","While I did like this video it seemed to lack alot of the traditional step aerobics in favor of floor aerobics. In addition, the cues that Gin Miller gave were lacking unlike most of her other videos."
3,Decent workout for beginners,"The workout is approximately 45-50 minutes long, including warm-up and cool-down. The music is boring, but Gin Miller is enthusiastic. I would recommend this video for beginners to learn some fun, basic step moves. Hand weights can be added to increase intensity. The video is primarily intended as a cardio workout: there is very little stretching and no weight training."
3,Not the Best of Gin Miller,"I am a big fan of Gin Miller's step workouts, but not this one. It isn't very intense and I thought it was too many dance steps and not enough step work. The Video, The Power Workout and Circut Challenge all all much better."
1,Like cheap clothes.,"Nothing too much to describe this clothes.When I get it, I don't think this is made by Marmot.It's not worth the price, I can buy a same quality in Columbia at about a half price."
3,For those of you resorting to this page for the song in the trailer,Here it is..Dirge by Death in vegas - Album: Satan's Circus
1,They didn't include k d lang's 'Love for Sale?' ???,"""I wish that [k d lang]'s sultry interpretation of 'Love for Sale' was included on the cd."" I can't believe THIS was left off! Somebody was certainly an idiot. *thumbs down* I WAS going to buy this CD... and, obviously, NOW I'm not going to buy it. :-("
1,Horrible,"I pre-ordered because I fell in love with music from the trailer and Mark's Crash soundtrack was awesome. This soundtrack is horrible, horrible, horrible. I played it once and will never again."
4,"Gentleman, this book is a 1991 publish date in hardcover.",This book is very well written and gives great detail of this pivotal battle for Kentucky. This was the first battle for those Illinois boys responding to Lincoln's second call for three year troops in 1862. It dominated the survivors after war writings and reunions. The author does their memory a greart service buy his throughness
3,Clean family show,Clean family show with moral plots. The acting by Loretta Young is poor however. It looks like she just showed up and ran through the performance without any rehearsal. Supporting actors are better. I have only watched the first few episodes so show may improve as series runs.
4,Loretta Young Show Season 1,Loretta Young is my all time favorite femail actress. I ordered 3CD's.The timely manner in which they were deliverd was great. The quality surpassed my expecations. In all the whole experance with these CD's was great. Connie in Denver
3,"a bit cheesed,but still trippy","for the most part this compilation of snow's scores from tv series/tv movies is very good,but there are some tracks where the keyboard cheese goes a little too far on the tracks that are supposed to be serious.it's still a great buy for snow and xfile fans alike,(there is an awesome half-hour long reworking of the xfile music meant to play like an episode that is trippy as hell!)but if you're not obsessive about it like myself I couldn't see paying more than $5 for it.(I found it for $2.50-and I find that a pretty good deal these days!)the songs meant to be goofy are my favs-the song from the pee wee tv show is the one they played when the claymation food came out the fridge,and snow's turned-down theme for the max headroom show is so 80's in that nutty way!it just sucks that 3 or 4 of the ""serious"" themes kinda go awry all of a sudden,but oh well.and what's up with the millenium theme going m.i.a.?I always thought that was snow's best work to date."
5,Le Femme Nikita Goes All The Way!,"At last a version of the main title from the tv show that goes on long enough to enjoy it. The girl who sings this version is better than the one on tv. I like the rest of the music on this cd a lot, but the LFN cut is worth the whole price!"
4,A curious collection,Interesting compilation of score cues by Snow from a lot of different sources. Well worth checking out if you're a fan of his work.
3,ESSENTIAL CHER,"To have atrue Cher ESSENTIAL collection wouldn't it be nice to start off with Ringo I LoVE yOu THAT SHE RECORDED IN THE 60'S UNDER bONNIE JO MASON?Then work through some Cher hits of 60's and unreleased songs of Sonny and Cher(there are alot of ATCO)and alot of other songs that were flipsides to singles on vinyl that never saw the day of light on CD.iTS GOOD TO SEE bad love FROM THE MOVIE fOXES,BUT there is CRimson and Clover she recorded with Elijah and Nature boy from Cher Remembers Sonny special."
4,Not exactly a comprehensive Cher collection...,"Most Cher collections(and there are many, many of 'em!)peter out somewhere between 1987 and 1993. This one doesn't even stretch that far, instead highlighting Cher's pre-and-post disco years of the 1970's. Still, it contains non-hits(but fun ones)like ""Hell on Wheels""(from ""Roller Boogie"")and ""Bad Love""(from ""Foxes""), plus songs with Black Rose(her metal period)and Meatloaf! Cher's throaty voice and non-expressive delivery bring out the campy side of the lyrics. She would later become a rock-lite belter and actually gain some much-needed vocal range, but that's a DIFFERENT collection! A-"
2,Mixed Bag,"If you are purchasing this product, beware that the software appears more DOS-like than updated Windows formats. It works OK with Windows 7 but the PC I have comes with better software. On a more positive note, the disk label applicator and labels work well. I would not buy this product nor recommend it and if the hardware wasn't included, it would have been a bust."
1,A waste of money.,A total waste of money. After I purchased this I realized I had a better program available on my computer.
3,ok,Two boys who live at opposite side of the earth share a common friend. Their friend is a brown thrush who migrates back and forth. Each boy does his best to protect the area that the bird lives. The American boy stops his dad from clearing trees for a new corn field. The Spanish boy tells the adults not to cut trees in his part of the world as well.The book was short and easy to read.I would recommend this to to teachers. I would make a good picture book for story times during a unit on birds.
2,Ray Padula SELECT A SPRAY 6 pattern hose nozzle,This is a good product. It has a good varity of options as far as spray.
3,tongs,These were purchased to use on party trays and worked ok for that. They are very small. The quality seemed mediocre.
5,"Handy, dandy items!","I searched the well known big box and specialty stores in NJ looking for small tongs and found absolutely none! I really wanted tongs for pickles and olives, but then saw all of the ones available from this site and bought them all (so I got the free shipping). Basic, simple and wonderful to add to your kitchen drawer. The flat ones for cheese, etc. are super when dealing with a deli platter with cheese slices. These are one of those things that you didn't realize you needed, until you buy them and wonder why you didn't own them sooner."
1,Junk,"These tongs are complete junk - don't waste your money. The rounded tong arrived broken at what should have been the closed end. The tongs are held in place by twist ties within their packaging...and when I removed the ties holding the rounded tong, it fell in two pieces onto the floor. It doesn't even look like the metal was welded - it's like it was glued or something. So I'll return these & purchase something that isn't so cheap. I guess you really do get what you pay for!"
3,"Appetizer tongs, not Vegetable tongs","Others warned about the size, but did I listen? No.... But they were free in the 4 for 3 price deal. But these tongs are not big enough to serve vegies. They would be great for deviled eggs, carrot sticks, or getting olives or pickles out of a jar. But not for my steamed broccoli. I could probably do one or two asparagus at a time. I have uploaded a picture with a piece of broccoli, so you can get an idea of scale.There is nothing wrong with these tongs. They are nicely made and have a nice appearance. But not good for serving vegies."
1,Since when is 6 inches 9 inches?,"I wanted tongs that were 9-inches long for use with my toaster oven. These tongs are 6-inches long and 7-inches long respectively. This is not a subjective matter and it is hard to understand why Amazon lets this type of false advertising persist. Amusingly the card on which the two tongs arrived is indeed a little over nine inches long! However the product comment says:""This pair of 9-inch long stainless steel appetizer tongs are perfect for many occasions.""Otherwise these are well made and of nice weight. This misrepresentation should be trivial to fix."
2,I tried.,"It was ok, but I couldn't get into it. Maybe I'll give it another try on another day. I originally got it thinking that it was a collection of short stories because of its title and I didn't really look at it, so maybe I'm being unfair. But I'll give it another try at another time."
3,promiscuous homosexuality without consequences,"This could have been a really great book, were it not for the entirely irresponsible portrayal of promiscuous homosexuality. As Samad recognizes and struggles with his sexuality, he is introduced to sex at a gay nightclub, and begins to frequent it, having different sexual partners each time. There is no mention of any sort of safe-sex practices, nor does he reap any consequences for his behavior. In the shadow of HIV, I feel that the author was sadly deficient in this part of the story. At the least, Samad could have received some instruction from Teller about the dangers he had exposed himself to. This is a science-fiction story about another world, but it is supposedly populated by humans who have immigrated from Earth, so in my mind a bit more social responsibility could have been shown in the writing."
4,An Excellent Show,"This is an excellent show, and I'm glad it has finally made it to video. The only disappointment I have is that between Collection 1 and Collection 2 (which are in episodic order thankfully), the episode ""Special Relationship"" is missing. This is a pivotal episode, and I hope it makes it into the next collection."
5,FEVER LEFT ME HOT,"This was my second Sutcliffe novel (Notorious being the first)and I have to say that this book blew me away! From the first page til the last I was simply captivated. This book has over 400 pages and I finished it in two, count them TWO days! Set in Louisiana, the author made me feel the intense heat of the bayou and made it come alive with her words. It was definitely not a light read. Very intense and a superbly written story with intriguing characters, some you couldn't help but love, others you couldn't help but hate. Thank you Ms. Sutcliffe for a superb story. This one will stay with me for days, the mark of a fantastic story and author."
2,Say it isn't so!,"Will somebody please reassure me that Katherine Sutcliffe, writer of ""Notorious"" and ""Jezebel"" did not write this steamy, schlockey, silly southern soap opera?"
1,parts missing,"For one, I really don't think this item is worth $218.00 even if all the parts were encluded. Only one-half the screws for the doors and hinges came in the package. There is no info on the manufacturer, no phone number to call to request parts. I wasted over 200 bucks!!! major disappointment! I gave it a one star rating only because I had to mark it but if I could I would not have given it any stars, this is a major quality assurance problem."
2,Inside Container,"I do like the looks of the wood white trash bin but I have a problem with it, I can't put a garbage bag in it! I need a container in it to put the garbage bag in. The way it is with the hinged lid you can't put a bag in and get it to stay. It would not even work for paper as you would have to pick it up (heavy to turn upside down) to dump it into a garbage bag. The inside is narrow and tall and I can't find anything that will fit in it. Not a good choice for me to use for garbage, I wish I would have know that I couldn't put garbage in it before I bought it. I had one I liked very well but it was old, the lid lifted off and I could put a bag in, then put the lid back on and it was great. This one looked just like mine but lid doesn't lift off so you need a inside container for it. If you can help with this problem I'd be glad to hear from you."
5,Great information and fun to read!,"This is a wonderful introduction to some excellent writers who found ways to work even when circumstances were less than ideal. It should make any Texan who reads, writes, and gets together with other lovers of literature proud to be part of a fine literary tradition."
1,Not what I thought,I ordered these staples online and when I finally received them they were the wrong ones.It was disappointing. The site should have a line by the product stating this items is used for ------.
5,Good Product,What can you say about staples? They work - I would recommend them to you if you need staples. Okay.
1,No help,Sent the wrong size staples.Sent a letter with size I want a month ago. Received no reply. How do I get my staples?
5,These are staples.,These are just staples. Why are you even reading reviews for this item? These are cheap and functional; what else do you need?
5,It's the standard staple: reliable and effective,"Cheapest price around for an old standby. There is no need for more words. If customers want a good deal for a staple, then this is a good deal."
3,Staples are solid,The staples are a decent product....the bostitch stapler that I sed the with leaves a lot to be desired. I certainly have no need to purchse product again sincestapler stop functining well after 1 month of use.
4,Gently magical,"Each of the stories and the beautiful pictures in this book take you into a magical and gentle world. Each story has the moral of finding and appreciating your inner spirit, yet each one approaches this idea with renewed innocence and wisdom."
5,Pretty Hot and Tempting!,"Oh my god! This guy is soo cute, and the best rapper! I could listen to bounce wit me over and over and never get sick of it. Lil Bow Wow is a totally talented rapper, and when he pairs with Destiny's Child it's Hot!!! Anyone who likes Rap will like him! He's P.H.A.T. Know that!"
5,Lil' bow wow rules!!,"The first time I saw him my heart just skipped a beat I love his music so much. He has gotta be the best compared to most rappers, I think that its also that snoop dogg basically discovered him snoop is another of the best rapper and he is definatly featured in this CD. His lyrics are clean but they get the point across, He will do awsome if he keeps it up. I bought the CD for all of my friends for christmas, and if he makes another one ill have it before it hits the shelf.... This CD Rox and everybody should have It."
5,bouncin with bow wow,for all you haters out there hatin on bow wow just remember that he making money and yall aint so boo ya. cause i know bow wow is gone make it to the top and he is so cute. i just hope he dont get pulled down by no haters. oh and bow wow can bounce with me any day. i luv u bow wow!
3,remember jump jump,kris kross did jump back in 92 now lil bow wow's doing bounce bounce heard it all before if this was an adult this would be so much garbage but best thing bow wow's got going for him is his age.
5,Bounce with bow wow,"This Cd is a most have cd, this kid is really going places in if you want to party this is the cd for you this kid is only 13 and his doing things that most people can only dream of. Plus his really cute."
1,Beware of THIS dog,I can't stand that single. My sister has been playing this single dozens of times already. Hip-hop should be performed by adults only.
3,"Heavy duty 1/4"" staples","The staples are fine, but the staples were all over the inside of the box when it arrived. The staple box was not taped shut and the stable box was shipped with a stapler in a larger box. Therefore broken columns of staples were everywhere. Ever try to get these things back into a box? Usable, but a mess."
4,Somebody bigger than you and I,"uplifting, heartfelt, moving and something to help keep your spirit lifted up. GooD!"
1,These Staples Caused Stapler To Jam Up,"I have a very old Swingline 13 Stapler (it is all metal). It worked fine but I ran out of Staples. I then purchased these Staples and , of course, the stapler jams up with the first staple. I then went to Staples and purchased a Swingline Heavy Duty Stapler 30095. I get that back to the office and that stapler jammed up. Then my classic Swingline stapler jammed up so I went back to Staples and got a Swingline Optima Jam Free Guaranteed stapler and of course, first staple out it jams up. I took the Optima back and just purchased the plain old Classic Swingline which also jammed up but I finally got it working. It appears that Swingline which is Acco Brands, Inc. (and all there staplers are made in China) is just peddling junk to everyone but they are also the biggest stapler/staple manufacturer. Ugh!"
1,Swingline Deluxe Gray Heavy Duty Stapler (S7039002R),"I didn't like that parts of the stapler were plastic. This is supposed to be heavy duty but the way this is made doesn't feel heavy duty. If you drop it once, it will likely break very easily."
1,This product from India has Formaldehyde in it!,"This product should not be sold in the U.S. I will be requesting a refund.From Wikipedia:In view of its widespread use, toxicity and volatility, exposure to formaldehyde is a significant consideration for human health.[4] On 10 June 2011, the US National Toxicology Program described formaldehyde as ""known to be a human carcinogen"".[5][6][7]A gas at room temperature, formaldehyde is colorless and has a characteristic pungent, irritating odor. It is an important precursor to many other chemical compounds, especially for polymers. In 2005, annual world production of formaldehyde was estimated to be 23 million tonnes (50 billion pounds).[3] Commercial solutions of formaldehyde in water, commonly called formalin, were formerly used as disinfectants and for preservation of biological specimens. [CORPSES]"
5,lucky find,"I like to try products such as toothpaste, soap shaving preparations and shampoo that I find in stores in countries I visit on business. I found this Meswak toothpaste in a grocery store in Calgary that serves mainly the South Asian community. It is an excellent toothpaste, tastes great (anise flavour)and you will find that your mouth is refreshed and gums feel better mine certainly felt better than they had for some time. I think some of these overseas products still contain some natural ingredients that promote healing of gums. I will absolutely buy it again."
5,Great,Great toothpaste. It keeps my mouth nice and clean with a pleasant scent. I would not only recommend this to a Muslim but anybody.
1,Poor value for price,"I am a non-breeder, average suburban dog lover. I have owned several labs, am about to get another. Purchased this book from Amazon.com, returned immediately. Content is adequate, but multi-authors give same material over several different chapters-poor effort at editing. Basically an amateur effort at a very high price by people who are not writers. There is useful information there, just low quality presentation."
2,Bad Protien,This item is terrible. One hour after taking it your passing it. Even Slim Fast holds you better. It may be good for some but I would advise being carfeul.
4,Smooth Mix,"Regardless of what you have read, this product mixes smoothly in a blender or with a spoon. I use this everyday and the only thing I can tell you is, you may need to have a spoon handy, if you use a blender, to scrape the excess powder off the sides of the blender back into the mix. 10-15 seconds you have a smooth fairly decent tasting shake. I add fruit, and would suggest you do too. 16 oz of milk= about 30 oz of shake. I drink one for breakfast and am not hungry all day. Its ideal for meal replacement, or for somebody looking to build muscle. 60g protein and 310 calories. I recommend this product for those looking to lose weight, or build muscle without consuming thousands of calories per shake."
5,Labrada rocks as always!,"My wife and I have both been using Labrada's products for the past year. We originally started with the Lean Body shakes but soon found the ProV 60 was cheaper when purchased in bulk like this. The vanilla is very versatile and we get rather creative with our shake flavors by adding fruit, chocolate or PB2. Between the two of us we have lost 120lbs and built some serious muscle. I have tried other brands but I always come back to Labrada because I get exactly what I expect and nothing that I don't want. We recommend this protein to all of our friends at the gym and my wife's personal training clients."
3,I still had pain,"I have major problems with my feet: Metatarsalgia, Morton's toe, heel pain, over pronation and Plantar Fasciitis. These are my fifth set of insoles. After a 3.5-hour hike in a forest park, I could feel the pain coming on, in my heels and it inflamed the bone area on the side of my left foot. Pros: they do cushion the impact, give good arch support, my feet didn't move around in my boots and they didn't pinch my second toe. Cons: hard to judge cutting insoles just right, hard to adjust correctly once inside the boots and after the hike I still had pain. I'll continue wearing them for the long hikes but bandaging up other parts of my feet. Hope one day I can find insoles that help with metatarsalgia and Plantar Fascitis."
5,Enjoy the underlying theme of the power of God.,"When you are ready to experience sheer joy, uplifting messages and terrific writing by some of the best contemporary African-American Christian Fiction authors, read Blessed Assurance. This is a collection of short stories with a mix of men and women authors. I think short story writing is a different skill because the author has less time to engage us, move through the story and wrap it up. These authors mastered that art beautifully. The underlying theme throughout the book is to remind us that the path our life takes is divinely crafted and blessed. It is an encouraging experience to read story after story of the grace, power and love of God."
4,My Baby loves it,this cd lulls her to sleep every time. the only thing that could make it better would be if The Cure actually did the music for it.
3,"Okay, for a while","I downloaded only my favorite songs from various Rockabye Baby CD's and burned my own compilation for my baby to listen to at bedtime. Of all the CD's I think The Cure songs are by far the best. The melodies of The Cure are really pretty to begin with, so I think they translate well to simple instrumental music. The baby fell asleep when I played it. However, I found myself growing tired of the songs after a couple of plays. The songs all sound the same after a while- every one (including those from other bands) are played with those chimes/xylophone or whatever that instrument is. I might want to play the CD more if other instruments such as an acoustic guitar or piano were used. I think we will listen to the CD once in a while, but it's not something that will be played on a regular basis."
2,Disappointed - use original,"I must say I am rather disappointed... however I am not the ""target market"".The problem is it is basically the same as original, only played using keyboards and instead of voice you get another track of keyboard.All the songs are ""lullabys"" itself as written originally by Smith & co. Therefore my suggestion is get your CD burner and create your compilation for the baby from original CDs. It will do the same job and you will have more fun :) ..as the songs get slightly boring played with keyboard and without the lyrics ;)My son (slightly <2yrs) already knows the original songs, of course -LOL-, and he does not seem to relate to this more than original. He likes MOBY most of all :DOK, that is my 2c.PP.S. The same is true for Radiohead and Nirvana that I bought as well.P.P.S. I bought many of these for my friends babies and (some) like it a lot.. so YMMV"
4,Great Music,If you like the Cure then you would like this CD. We put it on for our baby before he goes to sleep and he seems to enjoy the melodies. We have a few CDs like this and they are wonderful. Our son enjoys the music and it doesn't drive us crazy!!!
5,"We Still Love Ya, Dusty","It's easy. This package has Dusty's charted hits, her pre-British Invasion hit with the Springfields (Silver Threads and Golden Needles), her work with Richard Carpenter and with The Pet Shop Boys. There is nothing not to like whether arcane B-sides are included or not. And I can ""figure out"" a body of music without liner notes if I must so I give them no weight. This is Dusty Springfield's best. Whaddya want, egg in your beer? Buy it. You'll be glad."
3,Great liner notes mask a mediocre collection,"If you're at all interested in Dusty Springfield's career, you will love reading the individual notes for each song--but what about those songs? Hard to believe they chose B-sides over A-sides, and album tracks over real hits. There's no ""Give Me Time"" here--instead we get something called ""Mama's Little Girl"". And was ""Breakfast in Bed"" the best they pick off ""Dusty in Memphis"" after ""Preacher Man"" and ""Windmills"" were chosen? The Springfields' ""Silver Threads"" is fun to hear, and Dusty's work with Richard Carpenter and The Pet Shop Boys is thankfully included, but ""All I See Is You"" is DRECK, bottom of the barrel stuff. Springfield's vocals aren't always on the mark, and the notes reveal a very insecure woman(she wasn't happy with most of her singles), but when she's good she's sultry and enchanting. B-"
5,Gone But Not Forgotten,"I am an avid music fan and I have listened to the music of 1955 thru 1970with great enthusiasm. Ms. Springfield is an example of the lost female singerwho exuded pure love,passion and sincerity in song. Her "" Wishin and Hopin "" and"" Just Don't Know what to do With Myself "" were also recorded by a young andsultry Dionne Warwick. When I listen to the almost pristine voices of women likethis it brings tears to my eyes. I also recognize that the times and people arevastly different and the innate love of person has almost evaporated. The boy/girl, out-of-breath, can't wait till Friday days have given way to instantgratification and lyrics that are shallow and often juvenile. Ms. Springfieldnow joins the memorial list of others like: Linda Jones, Mary Wells, PatsyCline, Eva Cassidy and others. Gone too soon with so much more to give. MayGod bless their memory and maybe the love of one another will take a return toyesterday."
4,We All Need a Silce of Humble Pie,"I certainly wouldn't expect to read a book on a subject like humility -- and even less, find it enjoyable. But this is a memoir of faith that begins with the Rule of St. Benedict and his 12 steps of humility and includes the author's experiences with AA's 12 steps, and her life as a Benedictine oblate, practicing Catholic and former Episcopalian. She starts out wondering what humility looks like and wonders if it is anything she would want, and ends up with answers to both questions that satisfy her and the reader as well. The only spiritual book I have read where a ukulele has a supporting role."
2,Humble opinion,"Umm...ahh...er...it didn't keep my attention. I have a short attention span. I require quick-wit, clever, insightful, fast paced writing. Alot of it is interesting. However I did not finish it yet. It's on my 'to finish' book list."
4,Buen disco,"Los nuevos arreglos que hicieron a algunas versiones de otros cantantes, son muy buenos. La voz de Miguel se acopla perfecto con la de los cantantes invitados."
3,The Synergy DVD is one of the lowest-quality DVD's I've ever seen,"A strange and interesting movie. Unfortunately ""Synergy Entertainment"" seems to have dubbed the DVD straight from a VHS tape. When they had seen the fruits of their labor and realized they had not completely destroyed the film - they then burned their logo into the screen periodically - like a frat boy proudly claiming a fart. Perhaps, had they not done this, I would have lost the case and forgotten who ruined the transfer."
2,"LIZ IS A LITTLE ""BLUE""","WOW!IS THIS PICTURE A REAL DOG...AND LIZZIE DOES DO SOME STRANGE ""BLUE""THINGS HERE.BUT IT'S WORTH THE PRICE AS A COLLECTORS ITEM OF BAD FILMS MADE BY GOOD ARTIST.THIS IS ONE OF THE BARELY KNOWN EUROPEAN FILMS LIZ DID AND PROBABLY NOT SHOWN IN THE US.[THANK GOD!]THE PRIMUS IS A WOMAN ON THE VERGE OF MADNESS FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT REASON..PMS?SHE SEARCHES FOR THE ""RIGHT""MAN WHO IS WILLING TO MURDER HER [?]TO HAVE SEX[?]ONE IS NOT SURE AND WHAT'S WITH THE PEANUT GUY?AND WILL LIZZE REALLY GIVE A B---J--?SHE'S NOT LOOKING HEALTHY HERE TOO...DRINKING IS BAD ON THE FACE.AND WHY IS ANDY WHARHOL IN THIS MESS TOO?WHAT'S THE POINT BUT TO HAVE AS A COLLECTOR'S PIECE.HMMMM."
2,Leave the driving to someone else,"The 60's film industry had some real gems and it also had some self absorbed mindless rambling celluloid trips that made you wonder what was in the blood stream of those who made them. This falls into the latter category. As a child of the 60's, I grew up loving even the lame products but this one is really stupid. The presence of Andy Warhol and Liz Taylor makes it seem like a project where all of their 'beautiful people' cronies got together to make a movie, the way you and your gang in your neighborhood put on a show using dad's old suits and the rusted farm implenments from the barn for props. The plot makes no sense, Taylor's purpose in the film plot is look good while wandering through it and the inevitble payoff in most 60's angst ridden films comes up at the end. I won't give it away, just believe me, it isn't worth the trip."
1,Would have been great if.....,This would have been a great item IF I had received the right product. I ordered the White Thigh Highs with a BLACK Bow and received White with Pink Bows....and I didn't even receive my costume AT ALL!!!!
4,over the knee hose,"Reenactor's can't find white or cream colored hose easily, thigh high hose only seem to come in black or natural. Either one can't be used in reenacting. So.... cut of the bows and roll these over garters and they look correct! Great delivery speed too. Plus the hose are heavy enough to take a lot of wear from those boots!"
2,Wrong color,"Well I got these even after reading some of the bad reviews. They showed they were going to be black and hot pink, I got light pink. By the time I got them it was too late to send back. I was very disappointed. They looked terrible with my outfit because of the wrong color. I wouldn't recommend ordering unless you wanna chance on the color."
4,Cute Thigh High,"Brought these for my Queens of Hearts Costume. It was a ""sexy"" version of course, so I needed some leg coverage. They are exactly as pictured. Comfortable and sturdy enough to stay up...I only had to pull them up once!"
2,bows wrong color,"Picture of item on Amazon shows black with white bows, which matched a black and white outfit I have. Just received order, and the attached bows are fuschia. :-( I needed black and white, as shown."
2,"Reckless no, scholarly and dry yes.","This reads as a graduate paper. I forced myself through it because there is information in the text. It is too detailed for a summary read, while not deep enough for an exhaustive study. I was disappointed because some of the author's subsequent books are great."
3,BRANDED /SEASON 2,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED WATCHING THESE SHOWS . IT'S A SHAME THAT THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE INTO AN HOUR-LENGTH SHOW . THE STORY LINES ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND SEEING SOME OF THE VETERAN ACTORS IN THESE EPISODES MAKES THIS A TRUE ""CLASSIC"" FOR THOSE OF US WHO ENJOY THE WESTERN GENRE!! WHY AREN'T THE SHOWS IN SOME KIND OF CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER??"
4,CHUCK CONNORS FAN,"I LIKED THIS SERIES, FIRST TIME SEEING THIS, I DO NOT ENJOY THE MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING BUT THE SHOWS ARE VERY ENJOYABLE. CHUCK CONNORS DOES A FINE JOB IN THESE SHOWS"
1,Ineffective.,I bought these after reading the good reviews but was very disappointed when the staples kept buckling and collapsing on top of the pages I wanted to staple instead of going through them. Approximately 25% attempts resulted in success.
5,Stanley Bostitch B8 PowerCrown Staples,"I hunted high and low for these staples locally at office supplies and big box stores and couldn't find them. These work great and were quite reasonably pricied. These staples, along with the Bostitch stapler, are much 'stronger' than a typical swingline stapler and will stape 8 - 10 sheets without flinching."
5,Classroom Use,These staples are specific to the electric stapler I have in my classroom. I have 150 students that come through my classroom everyday. This stapler does not jam. It tackles the packets easily. I am very pleased with this product.
4,BOOM!,"These staples go with the Stanley Bostitch AntiJam Electric Stapler. It is a nice stapler, as my following review will attest:You need something stapled, you just slip it in the slot and BOOM!People in your office, and down the hall and down the street know that you have stapled something. This is no sissy stapler, this a strong stapler that will quickly and securely tack together a big stack of papers.Two things though:1) if you have a short stack, the stapler is sometimes too powerful. It is made for bigger stacks, so instead of neatly stapling two sheets together, you have a stable-sized hole in your paper.2) You need proprietary staples, so you can't just use any staples, you have to buy the special staples. I had to wait while the staples were on order at my office. Not a huge thing, and the waiting was my fault, but it was annoying."
5,does NOT fit the Aceliner stapler,"So they seem to be good staples, hence the 5 stars, but don't get your hopes up if you own an Aceliner 502 stapler from the 1970s. Bought these since some reviews seems to think they'd fit the older staplers, and I do admit, when comparing them to the Swingline standard staples #35108, they are narrower, but they still don't fit. Funny, the actual staple is also wider than the picture on the box labelled ""actual size"". Sigh. back to my hunt for the Ace 2025 staples."
2,not very good,This product hurts the hands when doing a big project. It also doesn't do the same job as the more expensive versions of these staplers.
1,Not your mother's Glinka,"Stay away! This is a collection of Russian dances, with nothing of the lyrical beauty of many of Glinka's works. If, however, you fancy jaunty music and Russian jigs, give this a listen."
2,OK Introduction to Fusebox 4,"I have been a web-developer for 6 years. I recently started using fusebox 4.0 but had several problems with this book. Firstly, they omitted putting an index in the book. Secondly, some of the fusebox/xml examples within the book themself do not even run because the code is bad. Lastly, many of the examples and concepts are not explained very clearly. I think that this book could have been written much better."
4,Pretty cool.,"The buckle is pretty much what I expected. It's got some weight to it, so it doesn't look or feel cheap. Perfect gift for the true Avenged Sevefold fan."
5,Cruxshadows never disappoint,"Wow. I loved the song Tears the first time I heard it in concert in Philly (home of knobhead) I heard the Knobhead remix premier at the show and waited with baited breath for the single. I loved Within, and Heaven's Gaze is one of my favorite songs, and the acoustic version is great. But my favorite is Jabberwocky. Annabelle Lee is wonderful and they continue the spoken word tradition with yet another masterpiece. I even convinced my parents, that though it's not their style, the band definately has talent!!!"
4,This is fun,"Their latest single, tears is a great lil song. Elements of new wave with elements of ebm with Rogues outstanding vocal talents and lyrics just make this song a gem. The only iffy thing about this ep and the reason why it got 4 instead of 5 stars is the repetitive remix of the song. I think the Cruxshadows have something fresh about them.. hearing repetitive remixes done by repetitve ebm bands doesn't do the song justice."
5,Another Great One...,"Tears is such a beautiful song and one of the band's best so far, in my opinion. I love the acousitc version of Heaven's Gaze, it brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it."
3,Better Choice,"Human Nature is a fantastic group. They do a variety of styles from pop to gospel. Although the track ""People Get Ready (There's a Train a'Comin'""), is superb on the Here and Now album,for a true feel of the group Human Nature, their album Dancing in the Street is a much better product.It is more imbued with the Motown sound that Smokey Robinson helped to make famous. For people who have seen their Las Vegas show, the latter album is more to the same flavor.If this is what you expected on The Best of Human Nature, you will be disappointed."
3,Good as expected,"These speakers and the 6 inch front speakers are better than the stock speakers in my 2002 Chevy Silverado. Had to stabilize the wires after installing them to stop the crackling I was experiencing, but since doing that they have worked just fine."
4,Yellow and sound good,"Picked these up to replace the blown speakers in my jeep yj. Since the jeep was yellow, I thought I'd accent where I could. Surprisingly, they are the same shade of yellow. Quality is good. They are not JBL or Inifnity, but, if you put a nice cross over on them to limit the bass, the highs are clear and mids very audible. These get pretty loud too. I rarely put the top on and have loud tires, can still hear the tunes. Price is right."
4,Not horrible,"Pros: Cant be pried openCan be bolted through bottom or backCame with batteries and ships quicklyVery cheap for an actual safeCons: Keypad speaker is loud as hellKnob used to open safe is plastic, slightly flimsy"
1,Not So Good Review,"Unfortunately, I just found out that this safe can be jimmied open very easily by a triangular-shaped X-Acto blade. >:("
4,Neiko 61013 550 Cubic Inch Fit Anywhere Digital Electronic Safe Box...,Works as described. Decent metal box with a key pad lock. it will keep minor children out so you ccan put small firearms or meds or sesitive docs in there and not worry to much. This isn't something that will prevent someone who wants to steal from you from doing so but it will slow them down for a minute. Good price for what you get.
4,"For the cost, a decent safe.","If you are looking for a very secure safe, keep looking. If you need something small, inexpensive, and not designed to keep out thieves with any heavy equipment, this works well."
2,locking code???,"Just received the safe and cannot seem to record a security code. I open the safe with the key. I have both kept it exactly that way or have used the key to close the bolts...and then I ..push the red button and the yellow light comes. I put in my code plus the # sign. Then I try the code with and without the # sign. Neither way am I able to open the safe. Has anyone else faced a similar problem? What might I be doing incorrectly? Other than this, the safe seems fine for what I need. But, I need help with installing the code."
2,broken and not complete?!,"I just received my Neiko 61013 550 Cubic Inch Fit Anywhere Digital Electronic Safe Box today - purchased from the seller ALS Group Inc. It came in a box that was totally destroyed that the post office had put in a plastic bag with a note basically saying (I'm obv paraphrasing) ""sorry your box was in pieces."" It came with three batteries instead of four (it takes four). And the piece of plastic that is meant to hold the batteries in place didn't clip in like it was supposed to so I improvised and taped it shut with masking tape. Also, there were parts that it came with such as screws and bolts, but they weren't mentioned anywhere in the directions? I think they might be for mounting it onto a wall? Anyway, not pleased at all with the condition that this arrived in."
5,Safe that is a good value,"The safe is as described. It is nicely set up and designed. It is not waterproof or fireproof. It is a great lock box for items you need secured. Shipment was FAST and the vendor packs it well. The combination can be changed easily. This is a problem with many competitors products. Simple, affordable and as presented."
4,Exactly what I needed...Easy setup,"I wanted to get a small safe to hold some items and it is exactly what I need. I ended up putting a few cushions inside to help protect but all in all it seems like a good safe for items not worth taking to my safety deposit box. Very easy setup, took me about 2 minutes. Also easy to secure the safe to my closet."
2,"Arrived in good conditions, but as already said, you can open it with a potato","I've seen in one of the reviews that you can open safes just by hitting the door while trying to open it. So when my package arrived, I immediately tried the trick and it actually works. I opened the safe in 30s without the code or the recovery key. Well, the package arrived in good condition, the safe is working but it just can't be called a safe as soon as you can open it in less than one minute and without any particular tool.... I won't return it because I'm just lazy to do it and if you don't know the trick, I don't think it can be opened easily. But if you are looking for a REAL safe, don't even expect something from this one."
2,Poor Quality Control,"The knob to unlock the door fell off after just a few days. Using the key, I was able to open the safe anyway, take the the locking mechanism apart and reinstall the knob; I trust I did a better job than whoever assembled it the first time. I guess it just proves the old adage that you get what you pay for."
4,Good for the money,Thiis safe is a Good deal for the money-nice basic safe that will serve the purpose for the time being. It is not expensive but you get what you pay for.
5,safe box,the safe was exactly what i was looking for. the size is very compacted for storage in a small area or clothad space . the electronic lock is very easy to work and changing the combination is simple. well worth the price.
4,GREAT small safe & GREAT price,"This is a small safe that easy to program with electronic keypad & keyed override. Easy to mount to floor/wall/closet for additional security. Not fire rated. Great for closet shelf - valuables & gun quick access. Perfect for securing home defense weapon & extra mags, without worrying about kids getting into it. I would recommend this safe. I'm buying a second one for the house."
2,Small safe,I dont really like this safe only due to the fact that the batteries are only lasting about three days even if it's not used.
3,door needed to be adjusted.,when i got it i found that it would not open for some reason. i jammed a butter knife in the top and wedged it open after using the key and i found that the door was pressing against the top of the safe and when you would shut it it would jam. but no worries it was pretty simple to loosen the door and adjust it. took me a couple tries however. for instance once the lock bars were not going deep enough and if you turned the knob to the right it would just open. but after i got through this it was relatively easy to set up and even changing the combination was simple when my brother got into it.
5,GREAT PRODUCT,WHAT A SAFE--IT WAS THE SAFE TO GET FOR WHAT I NEED IT FOR---GREAT SPACE AND EASY UNDERSTANDING HOW TO USE IT
3,safe,I ordered two; one arrived in good condition while the other was damaged in shipment. The plastic piece which houses the combination keypad was broken. Aside from the somewhat flimsy plastic housing the product met my needs & expectations.
1,Disappointed,Received this product with a damaged keyboard. Contacted the seller who stated it was a shipping problem. The safe was packed in 2 boxes with packing material. Neither of the boxes showed any sign of damage & the safe did not have any visible marks or scratches. I had to take the safe apart & repair it myself so it would function. VERY UNHAPPY with this seller.
1,garbage factor 10,"Junk. Keypad does not work. Tried to replace batteries and battery cover broke.Tried to get out batteries and battery reservoir broke. I got it because I wanted touse the keypad, but now am forced to use the key. Junky, junky stuff. BUY A DIFFERENTSAFE."
3,Lost factory Code -- Help,"I purchased this safe in Dec 2009. It's just sat in my closet since then, unused. Seems like a good safe but I don't know because I cannot get into it!My cleaning lady has thrown away the instructions. Does anyone know the factory code that it has upon arrival?I've looked online and cannot see a link to a product manual anywhere. If anyone has a clue where I can find one that will be great. I guess if not, I have to throw this in the trash and buy another.So, I can attest that it's pretty safe...because I can't get into it to reset the code to my own!"
2,Neiko Fit Safe,"For $40 shipped this safe had the basics covered. I could change the combo easily. The bolted door seemed solid and it would hold several small valuables. However, after about six months the locking mechanism failed. You could just keep turning the handle and eventually (combination or no combination) the lock would open -- evenually quickly turned into two or three attempts or even the first attempt. Maybe I just got a bad one."
4,Good deal.,This is a nice product for the money. I'm completely satisfied and it'll make a great Christmas present for my wife.
1,what a rip-off!!!,"Great idea and good price....IF it worked!! Tried everything to get this to lock when I got it to no avail. Unfortunately I paid for 2 day shipping on it as well. So even though I am returning the product for refund, I lost out on the $24 shipping. SAVE your money and get a brand name product not this piece of junk!!!"
5,Great Safe!,"We bought this safe for our nine year old. He loves it....opening and closing it constantly to put in his money, candy, yo yo or whatever else fits! Great value and quality."
1,Received Broken,"Upon delivery, the box was beat up. It was also missing one of the straps that hold the package together. I opened it up and the plastic had a hole in it just below the keypad. I was also a bit surprised when I realized the batteries came pre-installed. Typically this is not done with electronics leading me to believe it was probably returned and repackaged as new. It's a good thing returns with Amazon are easy."
5,Keep your Items Safe!,"This was a wonderful product. It came on time.! was perfect i would order from this company again, as a matter of facti will order this again, for a friend. Perfect for what i needed it for!"
4,Neiko's small safe box,"My Neiko Safe box arrived quickly. It appears well made and includes expansion bolts to secure it in place, without suggestions for placement. The directions show that it operates in a similar fashion to most hotel safes, and includes an override key in case of battery (included) or memory (3-8 digit pin) failures. This safe provides convient storage for personal identication, credit cards, small guns, etc.Neiko Fit Anywhere Digital Electronic Safe Box for Home, Office, Boat/RV - 550 Cubic Inches - Gray Color"
1,terrible,this safe is terrible my own brother broke into my safe and stolemy own mony all i can say is that it is not safe at all
1,incredibly fragile,"When the box arrived, I opened it and saw that the product box and been severely damaged and there were little pieces of plastic every where. I took a closer look and saw that combination panel on the door had some how cracked into 8 or 9 different pieces and was more or less ripped off the safe.I understand things get damaged in shipping, but this is supposed to be a safe. The panel should not be made of glued on 1/64"" plastic. Won't even consider anything from this manufacturer again."
4,Another Strong Entry From Ellis-Bextor,"Sophie Ellis-Bextor's latest single finds her mining the same dancefloor mentality as her two previous solo smashes. While it's hard to beat the should-be classic 'Murder On The Dancefloor', 'Get Over You' provides more proof than Ellis-Bextor is far better suited to disco reflections than some of the more '80s style synth-pop that takes up alot of room on her debut cd. That said, the album's 'Move Any Mountain' is also here, and personally I've never been very fond of the song--she seems to be trying too hard to go for a Dido/Olive musical cross, and I just don't feel it working. Otherwise, this single is another strong entry from one of Britain's more distinctive pop vocalists."
5,NGE is on the top of the anime food chain...,"The series isn't your typical mecha you got used to seeing, nor the usual ""heroes"" who comes in to save the day. This is one of the best psychological, yet the most disturbing anime ever written.We also got used to see the heroes of other mecha animes enjoying the moment of victory. Here, it's quite the opposite.Tokyo-3 was under attack. The pilot Rei Anayami was in no condition to fight the intruder. Shinji Ikari was called upon by his father, the commander of a task force called NERV, to pilot a bio-mechanical robot EVA Unit 01. All Shinji wanted is his father's love and affection. He was forced to put himself in the situation no other 14 yr old child should endure. Shinji never wanted to pilot the EVA nor get involved with NERV.You can see the terror through Shinji's eyes once he battled the 3rd Angel. What can you do? Is there anyway to stop this monstrosity? Only to see a glimpse of what kind of an entity is the EVA Unit 01."
5,Evangelion is the best anime series ever created!,"I don't know why alot of people are saying that the dvds are bad. I think that ADV did a good job on the dvd, as well as the dubb. I really enjoy Evangelion and reccommend it to any anime fan."
5,I Love this show,"I wrote a reviews earlier and said this show was horrible, but that's before I watched the show I love it now I am so sorry for saying that stuff before."
3,What>?,"first i thought this was going to be another Gundam. but i was wrong. This was way too confusing. Makes no sense that a city can go through hell every episode and their it is again nice and shiny in the next episode. And what r these Evas>? robots or animals>? first 4 episodes r very confusing, espiacialy with 3 main character kind of off in the head. Why did i buy it>? I'm a anime nut so if ur also a nime nut but it, its not that bad."
3,evangelion,"My favorite anime ever sees the worst dvd transfer ever. I almost cried when i watched it. At times it looks worse than ADV's own VHS version and that was bad. But its evangelion and if you don't have it on VHS you just have to sniff and go get it. Otherwise stay away.., i think it killed my 20/15 vision."
1,great animation but bad dvd manufacturing,"Even while writing this review, after viewing the ADV DVD, my eyes are color-separated because of the bad transfer of DVD color separation. Don't buy this DVD but keep your VHS tape. The publisher ADV should apology for this bad production."
4,Great Anime,This is one anime series that i will contiue to buy. i bought this DVD without ever seeing an episode first. i just went off what i heard about the series. IT IS GREAT. i cant wait to get the rest of the series.
4,"not heroic, only humane","A very emotional story of an introvert kid who constantly battles with himself to overcome his lack of self-worth, and of those who struggle to survive in treacherous land.NGE provides you with interesting and easily indentifiable characters, good amount of mushiness, but also a good dose of occasional humor.Only thing that bothers me though is English dubbing, which seems sometimes out of character, especially Shinji's, because his English voice doesn't quite deliver his nature that is shy and unsure. Or maybe it's because i've heard that voice from other animes often as characters who are quite the opposite. But i got used to it as i went along. On the other hand, i must mention that Rei's English voice is fantastic. It almost gives you chills because you can just hear from the voice the hollowness and almost invisible existance with which Rei carries herself."
2,Horrible Mess!!,"I'm a HUGE fan of Evangelion and I like to think it's the best fictional material I have ever seen, real or cartoon!!The Collection 0:1 DVD is simply horrible to watch!! It's the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD. What the hell was ADV thinking?? And why on earth did Gainax Studios approve of this releas? It's beyond me... I have to agree with another reviewer on this page; I was shocked to see the previews of other ADV titles were of far greater picture quality than the program material of the disk. The Evangelion DVD looks far worse than the VHS release. And that is almost unbelievable, and most certainly unforgivable.Very, very dissapointing indeed. Collection 0:2 looks slightly better but not good enough. I expect some heads to roll at ADV Films for this horrible looking DVD! Releasing Evangelion -or any title for that matter, in this poor quality should almost be considered a crime punishable by law."
3,neon genesis - overated!,"neon genesis hype pulled me into buy volume 1 and 4. altho the characters are likable and believable, i find the series weighed down with too much dialogue and political play. to tell u the truth i also bought the neon g comic books and they were wayyyy more intersting than the dvds! simply because the characters are more well developed in the comic books - the dvd doesnt permit it due to time constraints on each episode! also each episode gets tedious the evas kill one angel after another.please rent it from video store first before deciding to buy or not!God bless"
1,"Great Anime, Poor Technical Quality!","Evangelion is surely one of the best animes ever made, but this DVD series are flaw in quality. The original anime was made in Japan ( 29.97 frames per second NTSC ) then it was ""restorated"" in germany ( 25 FPS PAL, needed transcoding, that interpolates and mixes frames ) and it came back to U.S. where it was converted to NTSC again ( more intepolation and loss of resolution and color added). The final result is an image full of transcoding artifacts and with poor color. I was told by a person from ADV films that they are remastering the DVD using original japanese masters. That will surelly improve the quality of the series and make it worth purchasing. Until then, I'll watch it on TV."
4,"Evangelion, confusing but great","Evangelion is one of the greatest animes ever made. It starts off with the main character Shinji who is selfconcious 14 year old. He enters NERV an organization who's sole purpose is to destroy the angels and stop 3rd impact from happening. Through out the series Shinji fights the Angels with the help from the Eva's and the other pilots Rei and Asuka. The ending to the series is what made it a 4 instead of 5. It is cheaply made, and confusing to understand what happens. I would recommend the movie ""End of Evangelion"" which is a much better ending. Anyways my thought is that Asuka and Shinji are like Adam and Eve. You may not catch this but i thought the whole time that Shinji and Asuka were exactely alike in a sense that they care to much about what others think of them.yeah anyways go buy the series you wont regret it...i didnt"
5,"Not completely original, but no less great","For people who have never seen this show... consider it a mix of Robotech, X-Files, and Twin Peaks. The mecha of Robotech, the conspiracy plots of X-Files, and the wierd and spiritual effects of Twin Peaks. Basically, an existentialist piece that battles the question 'What is self?' while fighting off aliens from somewhere else. The animation and effects are great and the storylines are capivating, IF YOU WATCH THE WHOLE. If you watch the latter or earlier episodes and miss the other ones, you will miss something. Also, The End of Evangelion movie coming soon gives a different,simpler explanation to events in the series. Unfortunately, the dub voice actors are pretty awful, I recommend watching subtitled. Also not recommended for those who do not enjoy watching giant robots kick butt."
5,Excellent work,"I, like most everyone reading this review, have all the Eva series. And yes I agree that ADV is borderline of milking this excellent story. But with that aside, this DVD rocks!The video image and clarity of the previous DVDs was the original cut from Japanese TV. In this edition it's been cleaned up considerably as you may know. And let me tell you, it makes a huge difference. It looks almost new! They did a great job of restoring the video.The 5.1 sound is also pretty cool. They've added some effect for the soundtrack and it gives certain scenes more aura and a better soundstage. Of course, it's in the battles that this 5.1 really comes out.My only reason to recommend this: if you love the best quality video and sound for something, than this is for you. If you have the whole series and are weary about buying it, rent it at least and check out the hard work they put into this restoration. I for one am pleased to put a little more money down for this excellent version."
2,"Cliche Queen, ho!","NGE embodies the worst elements of anime, and those elements are anime cliches. Impossible and inexplicable mechs, adolescent heroes (the first of which is angst-ridden and emotionally unstable, another is a loner, and the third is sassy), busty curved women, and mystifying plot. I guess if you're one of those ""otaku"" freaks this DVD will be right up your alley. Others can move on to something worth watching, like Mononoke, Rurouni Kenshin, or Excel Saga."
4,What the heck is going on?,I've heard so much about Evangelion that I rented this DVD a few weeks ago.And my brain is still spinning around inside my skull.
1,really bad work,"Well, Evangelion is just one of the best anime series i ever seen. So i didn't wait a lot when I knew its release on DVD. But this DVD is of very poor quality and just make me regret not to have the VHS instead. Hope next volumes will be much greater to reach the OK level for a DVD."
2,A slow start,"If I were to judge a series on the first two to three episodes, then Evangelion wouldn't have made it. The story starts very slow, and this DVD is more of a prologue to the rest of it. So, either buy the whole series, or don't buy any of it. The series gets 4 stars, this DVD only gets 2. Trust me, the second and third DVDs are a lot more exciting, and lay the groundwork for the really [messed] up stuff that happens later.I believe the company that distributes Evangelion in the stater ADV, now has a box set that wioll save you money in the long run. Check there and bestprices dot com first."
4,Fine line between genius and madness,"Characterized by complex beats and sounds, it's hard to believe that Sacramento-based Hella is made up of only two members. With their fourth album, The Devil Isn't Red, guitarist Spencer Seim produces the sounds of two erratic guitarists rolled into one playing off Zach Hill's pounding drums into an incredibly complex combination of indie noise rock. Hella proves there is a fine line between genius and insanity with the unpredictable track ""Hello Great Architect of the Universe."" Overall, the album is lighter sounding then their acclaimed first album Hold Your Horse Is as Hella continues to develop and define their unique sound. Tracks such as ""Mother Could Be You"" and the final track ""Welcome to the Jungle Baby, You're Gonna Live!"" help to decipher a method to Hella's madness. Their music combines the feeling of improvisation with the innovativeness of Primus, leaving much to look forward to in Hella's future.B-"
2,Potently unfocused,"2 1/2Fans of methed-out math rock along the lines of Don Caballero will feel right at home with the hyperactive assault drum and guitar duo, but as a whole TDIR is just too schizophrenically vacant to be anything but a once-in-a-great-while-onslaught kind of album experience. Between half-cooked electronic disharmony and relentless thrash-and-pounds, hardly any tracks feel developed past the effect of constant bleed through, track by track. Still, there is no denying the short-lived, superficial intensity to some of this."
3,too much of a talent in your face.,this album is basically..drums and guitar playing the same thing in every song.......its like torture.real fast drumming accompanied by guitar accords.not that good.
2,Sophmore album syndrome,"The worst 'new album let down' since Metallica put out the black album, the Page and Plant albums, or even Smashing Pumpkins' Adore. The elements that made Hold Your Horse Is so excellent are almost completely missing on 7 of these tracks. Sounds like the guitarist ran out of ideas and decided to make up for it by cranking the distortion.While it is still a thousand times better than anything Nu or MTV, if you heard Hold Your Horse Is and are looking for more of the same, forget it. This sounds closer to the noisy ep's in between lp's.Sorry Hella! The cult of HYHI has been established."
2,Hella annoying,"I just don't see the big hellabaloo with dis album. They can play I guess but I long for the days when a band could not only play their instruments but write songs as well. Oh, one more gripe; the keyboards are a bit too sweet on occasion."
3,An improvement,"The appeal of Elevation 2 hinges primarily on three tracks: Jonn Serrie's mysterious and rhythmic ""Lovers In Motion"", Patrick O'Hearn's haunting ""Trust"", and Ascension's entertaining ""Beauty In All Things"". Other tracks, such as Aria's ""Secret Tear"" and The Spirit of Eden's ""Compassion"" sound nice upon the first listening or two, but their naive quality begins to show through soon. Other selections are somewhere between listenable to annoying."
4,"Good quality prints, driver interface somewhat convoluted","This printer replaced a four-color photo printer which gaveless than acceptable prints. In short, the photos printedlooked nothing like what was seen on the monitor.The Epson Stylus Photo 1400 solved this problem, but it took awhile to figure out how to get the prints to match the monitoroutput. The first attempt, which was to install and use the papermanufacturer's profile, failed. Apparently other users had thisproblem as well.Epson's printer driver provides a number of options for photo printing,but it's not always clear which ones should be used and what theresult will be prior to using ink and paper to find out. With Ilford5x7 Premium Glossy, these options produced the desired result:- Epson Ultra Premium Glossy paper- Best Photo- Photo RPM- No Edge Smoothing- No High Speed Printing- Gamma 1.8Hopefully your results will be as good with less effort spenttwiddling the driver options."
2,"This printer started great, but it's falling apart","I bought this printer for my Father last year. He's printed approximately 2,000 4x6 prints and in the last several months the print quality has severely degraded. It requires two to three major cleanings to get decent image quality on OEM inks - regardless of frequency of use. I'm familiar with Epson as I'm a large format digital printer by trade, but this is not a machine I'd recommend at all. Price point was decent, but I would've spent more on a printer that was meant to be run and not used sparsely. If you have any inclination to print a substantial amount of digital prints this is not the machine to buy."
1,Printer is not worth the plastic it is made of!,"If you love headaches, stress, ulcers, or otherwise hate your life get this freaking printer. This by far is the worst printer I have ever used. Will not feed documents correctly, uses ink like small children drink sodas, and fails to reproduce color accurately. I would not wish this printer on anyone."
4,so far so good,"Read about the problems with early notices of ink being out, but so far no problems. Have printed one fairly large job with a big use of one color. Was half expecting some sign that I needed new cartridges, but haven't had that yet. I am a graphic arts students with lots of large size (portfolio) projects so needed a less expensive large format printer, and so far this fits the bill."
1,"overpriced, buggy, frustrating ink & paper consuming waste.","when this printer prints correctly the photo quality is ok- i never achieved anything stunning, but acceptable. ""When"" is the operative word here. From day 1 this printer (or the printer's software) did not function properly - i would say i had to print about 4 (expensive) sheets of paper (and corresponding ink) for every satisfactory result.within a year and a half, the nozzels clogged (i cleaned regularly) and the paper feed failed - again,not consistently - so you end up wasting lots of expensive paper. .Epson's ink is overpriced -this seemingly low price for the printer is a classic bait and switch.I am not a computer novice, a former IT mgr, and have worked with dozens of different color printers - this is by far the worst I have encountered."
1,Save your money,"Great detail, etc..Then the Ink clogs,the Ink blobs on the prints, etc...Espon?? Ha they say end of lifeyea.Never again Epson."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!,"Great printouts. Printer is too expensive, ink is equally too expensive. Customer service sucks! I went through all 6 $20.00 cartridges with only 20 printouts. I replaced them all a month ago and didn't use it for a month. I went to use it the other day and nothing printed out. I tried to clean the cartridges and the drivers told me to replace the cartridges. I sent an email to Tech Support and they told me to replace the cartridges. I told them they are brand new in the email and thats all they could tell me? DO NOT BUY EPSON! BUY HP, KODAK OR CANON!"
2,Doesn't recognize label stock,"This printer replaced my previous Epson Stylus Photo model that wore out after years of service. It's satisfactory in every way, except that it frequently doesn't recognize standard Avery label stock as paper. It will often push it right through and tell me that the paper is out or not loaded properly. Sometimes shutting down the printer and starting over works, and sometimes not.This problem didn't occur the Stylus Photo printer I bought several years ago, so it's a big disappointment to me in this newer model."
3,Great prints but high ink usage,"I have used Epson Printers for years , and have had great success in my photo business using the 1270 and 1280 printers. They are consumer printers but have stood up well to the heavy usage that I subject them to, often running prints straight for days at a time. Now that the 1280 is out of production I decided to move to the 1400 for printing my smaller prints.The prints are slightly better than those off the 1280 and the Epson interface is easy to understand...unlike my Canon IPF 5000. But, after I did a ink usage test I was very disappointed. The ink usage cost for the 1400 is 3 times what it was on the older 1280. One would have thought that the single color cartridge ink costs for the 1280 would be higher than the individual carts costs for the newer printer but not so. Epson continues to sell a great printer at a moderate cost only to rob the customer with the price of their ink."
5,It does more than it is touted to do,The 1400 gives me the prints that I am looking for and is easily calibrated to the color I see on my monitorIt tends to print some what darker than the monitor but knowing that it is easy to compensate for . The colors are true
2,Nice Printer but doesn't print anything thicker than photo paper,Nice Printer but doesn't print anything thicker than photo paper. Bought this to print brochures and larger posters and such. the quality is good but you cannot print anything thicker than photo paper. Epson sent me two replacements under warranty before telling me this.
5,The Best Printer for Hi-Def Photos,"This printer is the best hi-def photo printer I've ever had....and exceptional value for the money. In a very short time after it's arrival, it paid for itself by printing top quality photos for my business."
1,Lasted less than 14 months!,"Print quality was great then it suddenly lost horizontal registration and started printing an obvious amount of pixels off - it looked like it was printing ultra bold when printing black - but when printing bar codes, they were not clear, and would not scan properly.I print a lot, but I expect better life than this!I contacted support about this and they said it must be a motherboard problem, but since it was out of warranty I would have to pay to get it repaired. The repair would have cost more than a new printer, so I bought a new printer - from another manufacturer!"
4,large format for those who need it,"This printer creates high quality results...at significant expense. Artists will appreciate the beautiful results (ink droplets dispersed in 5 sizes, beautiful archival inks, ability to make large prints). But by my calculations each letter-sized print costs about two dollars, and the printer won't work if any ink level drops to low. I'm not tech-savvy so am a little overwhelmed by the thought of having to recalibrate, etc. But for beautiful results I'm not sure this printer can be beat."
2,Expensive printer to upkeep.,"Expensive printer to upkeep. Greedy Epson rejects recyclable generic cartridges while their genuine epson ink cartridges are overpriced and not that reliable. If I buy an expensive $400 printer. I expect to use whatever quality materials I want, because I own the printer and I want to get the best printing performance. Epson intentional sabotages their consumers by forcing their users to use their brand of poor quality inks.I own other large format printers and Epson tend to need more baby sitting."
5,Good,"This is a good product. I don't know how to use it at first,and contact to the seller. But finally I can use it. It is good and convenient."
1,Banding,"Barely used this printer at all for over a year and then kicked back into photography mode again and the printer prints horrible horizontal banding in every photo I print. Ink cartridges are a pain in the ass to get as you cannot buy them in stores and they are expensive as hell and the paper loader fails and requires cleaning in order for it to work properly. Skip Epson all together and go with another brand, their printers get consistently worse reviews than competing serious photographer photo printers."
2,Great printer for 2 years and then paper feeder broke,I've had the Epson 1400 printer for about 2 years and was happy until last night when the paper feeder broke. Not sure whether I should chance buying another Epson now. I had an Epson 1280 for 8 years and it was great.
1,Worst printer ever,"This is the second printer we have ordered in 2 weeks, the paper feed is not working correctly, the print quality is the worst, and tech support was useless. You will be wasting your money if you buy this printer. I am sending my second printer back for the same reasons as the first. My employee has spent 2 days trying to get both of these printers to work correctly now after precious time & wasted payroll I am sending it back. I will never order this type of printer again"
1,Continuous problems and the worst customer service...,"From the beginning this printer was difficult to use. The driver with my imac had to be continuously reinstalled. (I use two other printers with no problems at all). If you don't clean the rollers regularly, the paper doesn't feed. But the worst of all was when I printed a CD, the met`al rollers left small marks. I emailed customer service and they responded with links on how to print CD's. Then they said they didn't understand. when I emailed back asking them what they did not understand they told me to take it to a repair center. No help, guidance or troubleshooting at all. In addition it says you are low on ink before you run out. The ink is ridiculously priced already - you would think they would be happy with the profit the're making already. I am through with epson for sure."
1,Hundreds of Dollars Later,"After the considerable (for me) expense of $300.00 for the printer itself, and several loads of ink later (at about $150.00 a pop) now this piece of junk won't recognize the ink. All seven cartridges are fresh, and I'm seriously cheesed off. Spend more if you have to, but DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER! The prints were pretty good, as long as it worked, but now it's nothing more than an unusual centerpiece. And from what I read, Epson couldn't care less. When their company folds owing to this type of shoddy merchandise, guess what, I won't have a speck of sympathy for them."
4,Not a bad printer,"While a bit on the big side because of its large format printing, it is a very nice printer. The quality of printing is excellent with its Claria inks. Text printing is speedy for an inkjet while photo print speed is actually quite reasonable considering its size. Price is less expensive than some of the other comparable printers but inks are very pricy in my opinion (each cartridge is $20). This is where Epson really makes its money. Everyone knows that when you buy a printer, you are buying the inks and getting a free printer for the most part. A set of inks for this printer cost $120 retail... yow.... at least they give you the 079 ink cartridges which is the big brother to the 078... same size, just more ink in them. Now I know why generic cartridge manufacturers are so popular with the Epson crowd."
1,"Bad, Bad,Terrible customer service","I've had this printer for a year now. I have bought Epson Ink Jet printers ever since the first one came out, and the quality and amount of ink needed has gotten worse with each new generation. I would presume greed has taken over and it is more about money than quality. I find myself using it less and less as I can barely print ten pictures before I'm looking at buying new ink jet cartridges. And even that MIGHT be OK, if the quality of the pictures were good, but they are worse than the ones I printed years ago on the first printer.And to top it all off, the absolute worst experience I've ever had with customer service was when I called to get help with the printer. I was sent to somewhere overseas and talked to people who couldn't understand my issue, couldn't communicate at all. It was ridiculous. I would rather pay less and simply not have support. This is my last Epson."
4,Epson 1400,"I really do love this printer. The quality of the prints are exceptional. I only find one flaw, and that is that it's hard to find ink for it! Most office supply stores do not carry the ink, nor do the online ink sites. You must buy it directly from Epson, or if you are lucky, Comp USA will have some in stock."
2,a LOT of aggravation...,"I got this printer over a year ago, mainly because I needed something to print images onto CD's, and also for general office printing. The print quality on the CD's was really lacking, the colors were way off (heavily magenta), and I had to adjust my images to compensate for the color issues. I would NOT recommend for printing photos.I've used it since for office printing, and when it's working, it's fine, but there are so many times that it gets a printer error, and doesn't give any details on what's wrong. The ink runs out quickly and is expensive to replace. I wish I would have spent a little more and got something more reliable and higher quality."
3,High quality prints but irritatingly inaccurate in brightness,"Given the high cost of inks and my limited time, I would like to be able to get the print right the first time. Unfortunately, while the color accuracy is generally very good with the Epson Stylus 1400 (I'm using a color calibrated monitor and soft proof in Capture NX2), the brightness/contrast is always way off - requiring several prints to get even close to what you were trying to do. Hopefully, this will be corrected via the printer driver at some point."
1,Epson Stylus Photo 1400 Photo Printer,"Wanted to replace my 1280 and was told the 1400 was it. Took hours to finally get it added to my printer list (I am on an IMac). Ate ink at supersonic rates and those new inks are EXPENSIVE and are not available in stores! Yes, get through Epson and free shipping. But it takes over $100 to get them!Then the printer wouldn't work. Made repeated calls and after all kinds of actions at long-distance rates, was told mine was inop and another would be sent. Another week elapsed before it showed up. At this point, I am in the second hour of trying to get it to work. I now have ""communication error."" No printer.I'll call again before I throw it in the ocean as a boat anchor! So far it has essentially been worthless!"
1,Sealing Ring,"I bought this item alone with the cover and the unit for my daughter,I used the unit that I bought few months ago, but last week, the ringbroke and the unit spilled out broth all oevr my dinning area and the wall,and stained three chairs which covered with very nice fabrics.It was a disaster. So I just want to remind people that keep a spare one on hand,and always face the steam outlet facing where lesser damage will be madeshould ring failed."
5,OEM quality,"Long overdue replacement, not sure why I waited so long to replace $10 part - my WMF pressure cooker works like new and it is 10 years old!"
5,Great price,"Superb price, looks fine. It is a spare so right now, do not need. Came pretty quick so, will re-order when the need arises"
1,Bad quality material,"Very bad chemical smell after cook. I tried few times, but it happened still. So, don't even try."
2,Okay (just),I did not notice any real change in my acne problem with this product at all. It works as a cleanser and seemed to dry out my face a little but that was it. Would not recommend for anyone with significant acne. Don't waste your money. I have found significant results with Salicylic Acid peel. Try that instead of this if you have significant problems with acne.
4,good buy,"for this price, this product is really good....the image is pretty clean and battery consumption is fairly good...."
2,I'm returning it,"When it arrived, I was a little disappointed. It is definitely not built to last very long. I was afraid that the door would wear out or break within a month or so. Well, that was not an issue because the unit never worked with the provided battery. It was Ok with the wall plug, but it's supposed to be portable. The sound was OK as long as it wasn't turned up too loud - picture was OK too. I would expect to find an item of this quality advertised as my first DVD player, reccomended for a child between 9 - 12, at a lower price - perhaps $49.99 or so."
3,"Silly and whimsical, acting ok",This appears to be an engaging movie although I cannot imagine wanting to view it multiple times. This segment showed how silly the production is yet the filming and editing seemed very good.
2,Tooth Fairy: In Character with Julie Andrews Featurette,"I like the info but wasn't what I expected-a movie instead received a brief interview.This brief interview wasn't a long movie of the Tooth Fairy, but did allude to a great interview."
1,An Absolute Joke,"I thought this would be a nice piece to add to my Stryper collection but I couldnt have been more wrong. This is hands down the worst CD I have every purchased. This is not a true cover album except for Grammatrains More Than a Man and it even has a stupid telephone type intro that is ridiculous. Im sure Michael Sweet and the rest of the Stryper guys were sick after hearing this so called tribute. I honestly think that they found local garage bands and told them to do these songs as horrible as possible. This CD has to be a joke on Stryper. Shame on me for not reading the reviews before I purchased. Yes, its that bad."
1,Absolute garbage,"Why did I waste my money? I held off for many years buying this CD......saw it was cheap and thought I'd give it a spin. What a waste of time! The overall musicianship on this recording is absolutely pathetic. I agree with the previous reviewer, if you want a good Stryper tribute album, purchase ""Gaurdian's"" version of ""The Yellow and Black Attack"""
3,Sweet Family Music: A Stryper Spoof,"I don't mind the album. The song interpretations are interesting with a wide variety of musical styles represented on the record, from lounge music to death metal.The biggest problem with this record is the name: ""Sweet Family Music: Stryper Tribute"". This album is more of a spoof than a tribute. It pokes fun at Stryper and the 80s ""hair metal"" scene. Keeping this in mind, you may find the it interesting, even amusing at times."
1,Only Good For A Coaster If You Don't Have High End Computer,"The requirements listed for this game are bologna. I have a fairly decent computer and this game locked up almost immediately.Make sure you have a really good computer or you will be very disappointed. In this case, it was my children who were disappointed.-----------------------My computer specs:Single core 2ghz AMD processor (Don't even try this game without a dual core)Nvidia 8400 GS video card with 248 MB onboard memory2 GB of ram on main system.Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit----------------------This computer isn't a gaming machine, but it hasn't had any problems with any other game we've tried but this one. That includes many newer games.----------------------Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone since it's impossible to know exactly what is required to run it. Save your time and money. You will save yourself from frustration & breaking little hearts."
1,A Boinicle disappointment,"This game is very hard to get to run on some computers.It's download, download,and download. My son was very disappointed."
5,bionicle heroes pc game,"I bought this for my 7 year old son but can't get my husband to stop playing it! This game is unbelieveable. We had to get a new computer just to run it, so make sure you have enough memory before you buy it, or enough money for a new computer :) This game is challenging for my computer geek 7 year old son and my 32 year old husband. It is a great game. The extent of the ""violence"" is the bionicles getting shot and the lego pieces that make up the bionicles flying through the air. So there is no gore at all. I would recommend this game highly for anyone who is into bionicles."
5,magic storytelling,"This book is part mystery, part love story, part ghost story (the dead come to life and the living disappear), and part intense travel writing, like On The Road, with amazing images throughout. You learn about elephants, hyenas, New York City rooftop parties, New Mexico back alleys, magic, and yourself, as you read mesmerized. I picked up the book at a book fair in Chicago and couldn't put it down."
2,Pretenious story with Bob Dylan title..,"""Desire"", Lindsay Ahl's debut novel is a messy, overly surreal novel about a bossy, manipulative, generally unlikable woman named Elena Monroe, named after her standoffish, crusading, and unknowable mother. Basically, Elena Jr.'s lover finds out that the mother is still alive, and not killed in Africa in 1975. Then, Elena goes to New York and then Kenya on a whim. We met a stoned, confused man named Forester who was Elena Sr.'s lover. Then we are bored to death, and cannot care less what happens to the whiny heroine. Next time, Ahl should create a character we can actually relate to. The novel takes its title from a 1975 Dylan album, the perfect title that a poseur would use."
3,???,"Why does Charlene hate Aquarians? By far, the roughest profile in the book. Water bearers love! Still a fun read."
2,Seems easily broken,"The fish are a good rubber consistency, but the fishing rod's material seems brittle and easily broken. I did not give it to my child to play with in the bath. I was disappointed because it looked better online than the one I saw at Target, but now it isn't."
5,AT LAST!!! The Fear Factory we once knew and loved...,"For those who think this is brand-new material from the now defunct Fear Factory...think again. This is a glorious flash-back to the hey-day of their early beginnings as one of the leading bands in Industrial and Death Metal music. ""Concrete"" definately leaves us Fear Factory fans such as myself in awe who have wanted to hear their earliest recordings. This is definately a BIG friggin' make-up from their last release ""Digimortal""...To let everyone in a little ""inside info"", this was the demo/e.p. that got Fear Factory signed with Roadrunner in the first place. Nobody has heard this compilation...not even the Fear Factory members since 1991! Several songs were actually re-recorded for the big brother album ""Soul Of A New Machine"". The influences such as Napalm Death, Godflesh, and Ministry all collide to form a sound of pure chaotic bleak futuristic soundtrack. Finally this Fear Factory fan is satisfied."
2,"Well, It's heavy!","Don't expect the Fear Factory you are used to. Forget Obsolete, Demanufacture and the like. This is much, much different.I used to really like this type of music, but just don't anymore. All I can say is that if you like Deicide or Obituary you will probably like this. Just expect a very unpolished, very, very heavy change.I am glad I have all of FF's albums, but this is by far my least favorite."
1,Garbage,"Senseless noise, this is just the type of crap that gives heavy metal a bad name. These guys have limited musical talent and each song is a carbon copy of the one before, and that is not a good thing. I saw FF open up for Slayer on two occasions and they were a total joke live. Slayer completely blew them away."
3,Medline Transport,"Sturdy built and brakes are the positive, Weight a minus. It would be advantageous if the transport could be adjusted for height."
4,Great Value!,"Used on recent cruise for my 85 year old aunt and was quite satisfied. Great value for price, lightweight, sturdy, comfortable."
3,Loose handle grips,Product arrived quickly and in good condition. We are disappointed in the looseness of the handles used to propel the unit. We have tried to tighten the screws and nuts without any success. The handles jiggle back and forth and are very loose. It doesn't affect the ability to use the chair but we are concerned it will continue to loosen. Otherwise the chair works well.
1,crude braking mechanism,"The Super Lightweight Transport Wheelchair/Wheel Chair leaves alot to be desired when seeking a strong, reliable Wheelchair. It's built pretty flimsy, has a crude braking mechanism, the wheels aren't that sturdy and it's hard to push someone in it who weighs over 500 lbs.You're better getting an old one from the 1960's at an auction, they're built to last."
4,Lightweight Transport wheelchair,Works great. Very easy to put in small trunk of car when you remove the foot rests. Footrests easy to put on and take off. Brakes great for going down a hill--don't worry about chair running away from you. For additional comfort I added color coordinated pillows on seat and in back. Mom likes and so much easier for me to handle. Pretty color!!
3,"works OK, we had to fix a defect","The transport chair seems well-made and it was easy to unpack, assemble, and use. However, after about 8 weeks of being used several times a week on shopping trips, one of the two rubber wheels at the front simply began to shred and fall apart. Within two days after that the chair was unusable. I called the manufacturer and sent them digital photos of the wheels. They promptly sent us a replacement, not for one, but for all four wheels, which seem to be working just fine. So I assume that there was a glitch in their quality control, However they corrected the problem quickly and professionally.UPDATE:After nine months of use, there have been no further problems, it works just fine."
5,Great buy,"I received this chair only two days after ordering!! It is wonderful, lightweight, easy to fold and collapse and also open up for use.Fits easily into side sliding door of our Toyota Sienna. I have some difficulty applying the brakes but feel when newness wears off they will be a little easier to use. Same product is much more expensive in local med supply store. Wonderful purchase."
1,Poor quality control,"The second time the chair was used, total travel distance of about 500 to 600 feet, the right front tire split apart down the middle and some foamy material ground out and into our carpet. When I checked the left tire it felt very spongy and appeared that it, too, would probably have come apart very soon. I returned the item and did not reorder. Please note that I have given this item a one star rating only because the form would not accept a zero star rating. This item was manufactured in China, as are most of the wheelchairs. However, I checked the same brand, Medline, at a local Medical Supply store and the tires seemed to be made of solid rubber rather than the spongy feeling tires on the ""Mail Order"" item."
5,Cute Red Wheelchair - Great Buy - great product,"This was a purchase for my Mom who came to town for a visit. She cannot walk distances. This wheelchair is red and it is very attractive. Transport means just that, someone else does the pushing - there are no big back wheels that allow the rider to push themselves - also why it's more compact and cute. Very sytlish. We were able to do so much more with my Mom that we would not have been able to do otherwise - Braves game, the Aquarium, CNN studio tour (btw, does not allow strollers), Centennial Park - watching the kids play in the water rings, World of Coke... It's great for airport use too - just gatecheck it. It is so lightweight & compact - can probably fit in any trunk. If it were not so cute, I don't think my Mom would have allowed us to use it."
5,Just what we needed,"We had trouble handling the bulky, heavy wheelchair; this is just what we needed - a super lighweight transport chair for my Mother-in-Law in order to take her places, Dr appts, restaurants, etc. Passenger loves it and drivers are happy too. Received only one day after estimated delivery date - probably because of ice/snow storm back east. After much research, price was right too."
3,Seat too low!,"Recently bought a Medline Transport Chair with brakes[...] works well but for me 6'4"" the seat is too low to the ground."
4,Overall nice,"I bought this for my Mom who can't walk long distances anymore. It arrived quickly and was put together mostly. It's a nice looking chair and she was glad to have a ride through the mall. It was easy to push. My only complaints are that the seatbelt didn't come close to encircling her, and she weighs about 170 lbs. There was still at least a four-inch gap there with the belt loosened as much as possible, so no way could you put a 275-lb person in this. My other complaint is that she couldn't stay comfortable for too long because the knees are up quite a bit when sitting. Other than these things, it seems to be well made and did the job."
5,Excellent product,I brought this wheeelchair so that I could take my mother shopping and to appointments. It is excellent quality and arrived very quickly. It was fully assembled and it is very easy to fold up and carry in the back of my car. I could not be happier.
2,Handle doesn't stay locked in place,"Large wheels make for a smoother ride, hand brakes a must for going down steeper grades, well padded arms, and a spot to press your foot to make it easier to go over small bumps like door sills. Nice chair!UPDATE: We rarely use this chair, so we just discovered a problem with the chair, too late to return it now. One of the collapsible handles does not stay in the locked upright position. We don't need it to collapse, so we will have the handle rigged to never collapse. :/. Next time I buy one of these, I will go to a local medical supply store."
2,scuff marks,"The lightweight chair is great, BUT the tires leave scuff marks on carpeting. Since I use this primarily in the house, I cannot have this! Can I get wheel covers? What to do?"
2,Transport chair,I purchased this wheelchair for my mom and I have used this wheelchair for less than a month and the handle broke off. Too much of a hassle to send back. Wasted my money on this wheelchair.
1,Left handle was broken off on arrival,The title says it all. The left handle was broken off on arrival.I sent it back immediately and hesitate before replacing the item with anything from Med Line.
5,"a best buy for a transport chair, can be pushed by client.","This is an upgraded product and worth every penny. Its very light, and sturdy and fits women. The back wheels are larger, so it does not tip.This version comes with brakes on the handlebars!!!!! , well worth the 20$. this means the driver can brake easliy and if the client wants to push the chair they can stop it easily, so this chair has some use as a walker. Its grreat for my mom, she can push it a bit and be very stable, then rest.shipping was awesome fast,,,, two days."
4,Satisfied Customer,We received our wheelchair much sooner than we were told. It is exactly what we wanted and very easy to manage. Thank you for your prompt service. We're very satisfied.
5,Quality lightweight chair that is easy to manage with brakes for the operator,"Very compact, light and easy to fold. A quality chair and easier for my parents to mangage with brakes that my Dad can use on inclines.."
2,fine chair but has problems. I am going to return it,"This chair arrived just before we left on vacation. Before leaving I attempted to adjust the brakes and I found out that it could not be done. The head of the Allen screw that holds the brakes to the chair is stripped. As it was no time to get a replacement before the vacation we took the chair with us as I needed it badly for the trip.I don't know if it's too late but I'm going to attempt to return the chair. The other three Allen screws show some sign of starting to strip their heads but are currently removable.If I can't return it for a replacement I should be able to repair it by drilling out the existing screws and replace them them with new ones.As far as the chair, not counting the brakes, it was very nice for the price."
4,Wheelchair,"My mother loves it & so does my sister. My sister is the one who has to fold it & unfold it for Mom to use. It folds & unfolds easily & is lightweight. It is easy for my mother to use also. The larger back wheels make it easier t steer, especially over yards & steeper terrain. Happy with the purchase."
2,downgraded quality,"I believe a good chair went bad here vis a vis changes made to the chair. I re-ordered the same chair model and it was apparent that the company had considerably cheapened the product, ostensibly for greater profit.Previous version of this chair had all metal brake parts and worked well. This replacement model had plastic parts that broke after one day of use.Previous model had a nice carrying pouch on the back built in. The new model lacked any pouch."
5,"Lite, easy to work with, all around chair, highly recommended","Use this chair for about 2 weeks now, I'll said is very light, comfortable, and very easy to move around, super A++++++++++++++++++"
5,Great light weight chair.,"I bought this for my mother who walks verrrrry slowly and it helps move her from place to place more easily. This is a well built, lightweight chair that meeets all my expectations. Two things that are nice that some chairs don't have.....hand brakes for inclines and the 12"" rear wheel helps the ride and maneuverability. On top of it the price is fantastic and it is light enough my Dad can easily lift into his car. You won't be disappointed."
5,A Great Buy!,"Great product, fast delivery!!! Needed a lightweight chair to replace a 43 pound standard wheelchair that seemed to get heavier and heavier to lift out of the trunk as time went on. I was concerned that the smaller wheels would make it more difficult to push my mother up sloped sidewalks, ramps, etc so I ordered this chair which has the larger back wheels. I really don't notice much difference in having to push and I like having the handbrakes for going down ramps. I truly love how lightweight the chair is and how easy it is to lift in and out of the car. I was also impressed with how promptly the item shipped after ordering. I received it within 4 days of ordering!!!"
2,second rate quality,"another reviewer mentioned that these napkins do not lay flat, even after ironing. I do not understand why she rated them 4 stars. These napkins do not lay flat nor do they fold flat. They are not very soft and just barely adequate for a cloth napkin. They stain more easily than other restaurant quality napkins I have and do not bleach well. The stitched edges are very narrow and rough, giving the appearance of seconds selection."
2,This blade should NOT have the dewalt name on it - it TERRIBLE !!!!,"I bought these blades to do some demo work in a home with 2x4's and a few 2x6's .... these should not have the dewalt name on them.The blades wend flat / wore out very fast.... I called a friend who's a contractor and told me to go pick up some Milwaukee Torch Blades.... Well, I needed them to keep working, so i went the big orange big box store... and guess what...You could actually see the Quality in the Blade in the Milwaukee Blades.... I bought a multi-pack as I was doing both mostly wood, and some metal cutting....I only used one blade and did about 20 times the amount of cutting with one Milwaukee blade than four of the dewalt blades.These might be good for the homeowner do it your-selfer.... but these blades are terrible, especially carrying the dewalt name.One blade even broke on me cutting through a 2x4 when it hit a hidden nail !!!!"
2,These Blades Quickly Go Bald During Heavy Duty Use,"I bought this pack of blades for some heavy duty cutting through my flat roof. They went bald extremely quickly. When I say bald I mean completely bald, as in there were no teeth left whatsoever.I went back to the store and bought Hilti brand blades and they held up much better. They did gradually dull out but it took a lot longer and they never went completely bald. (They were significantly more expensive - around $4 a blade for the longer size)."
2,Worked fine but found a cheaper set at Amazon,"I bought this set to use in my Milwaukee Sawzall when I was doing a remodel job at my bother in-laws. These worked fine cutting the 2x4 and 2x6 rim plate and the old pvc and copper pipes we had to remove. These fit DeWalt or Milwaukee saws. The longer blades are great for tough to reach spots and old headers that are doubled up 2 by lumber. After I used these up and needed more I found the MK Morse brand in the same kit from Amazon for the price. These worked just as well and saved me money. Both say ""made in USA"" and Ohio. I ""goggled"" MK Morse and it looks like they make only blades in Ohio? My guess is they are making the DeWalt blades for DeWalt at they are a tool manufacture not a blade manufacture. When I was at my local ""Menards"" they sell MK Morse too.So the blades are fine (gave them 2 stars) but the deal is not good (gave them 2 stars).MK Morse RBKITHD01 Heavy Duty Reciprocating Blade Assortment With Storage Case, 12-Piece"
5,"Nice variety of blades, good value, handy case","I'm pleased with this blade set - it's a good value for the price. The blades have a decent life span - not as long-lived as some other brands I've used (such as Lenox), but more than acceptable for the price paid.I especially like that there's a good variety of blades and that the included case is compact so it can easily fit into the tool case. The blade case fits blades up to 9 inches.The set includes:Three 6-inch 6-TPI WoodThree 9-inch 6-TPI WoodTwo 6-inch 18-TPI MetalThree 8-inch 14-TPI MetalOne 9-inch 10-TPI DemolitionDewalt makes another set with a case (model DW4890). While that has more blades (15), all the blades are 6 inches and the case is rather bulky. This set is more versatile for my needs. Highly recommend."
3,Decent set but nothing special.,"The included case is great for storage but not as useful as I had hoped it would be, as I cannot see what size blades I have remaining as well as removing a single blade on the fly takes a little bit more care than I would have hoped.I would recommend purchasing blades that are black in color, as after first use, the yellow coating is instantly wiped off making the blades look more used than they actually are."
4,Dewalt 12-piece reciprocating saw bled set,"Product was just what i wanted, it came in a very timely fashion and it was at a great price."
5,The hitch-hiker's guide to Algorithms.,"The Catalog was my main reason for buying the book. It's an invaluable reference base for people whose boss 'needs an answer by tomorrow'.+ : The War Stories are fun reading, and do a good job of explaining how theory relates to practice. - : Restating the obvious at times, while deliberately vague elsewhere. Net : if you use a greedy heuristic to select your reading, this book probably comes ahead of the pack."
5,good book,"Awesome book! Apart from the good collection of algorithms, it also teaches you where/how you can apply these algorithms in ""daily life"" with a section on 'war stories'. The use of simple lanaguage and great presentation makes the algorithms easy to understand. Amazing reference for both academia/professionals."
3,Amazing Book But Very Theoretical,"I hate to give this book only 3 stars, since it is obviously so well done. But it is not a book for everyone. If you are at the advanced level, you will treasure this one.But if you want to learn practical algorithms at a more basic level, I recommend:Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals,Data Structure, Sorting, Searching (3rd Edition)by Robert SedgewickorData Structures & Algorithms in Java (Mitchell Waite Signature Series)by Mitchell Waite, Robert LaforeorData Abstraction and Problem Solving WithJava: Walls and Mirrorsby Frank M. Carrano, Janet L. Prichard"
5,The New Piano Man,"It used to be Billy Joel. He told stories and forced you to listen with the power of his hooks. Now it's Ben Folds. If ROCKIN' THE SUBURBS proves nothing else, it proves that he is today's master storyteller. This album is nothing less than a masterful tapestry of tales, a photo gallery of very human snapshots of pain, loss and happiness. From the first notes of ""Annie Waits"" which opens the album, to the sad and tender last whispers of ""The Luckiest"" which closes it, this will rank as one of the best albums of its time, I have no doubt. I have almost worn it out with repeated listening and still find new things to admire with every spin.Don't miss out. This is the best pop album of the year."
4,a review (live from the rocked suburbs),"I was always jealous of my choir friends. They could listen to a cd a couple times and have the whole thing memorized. Two weeks from my aquisition of the cd i've got most of um down. Ben conquers his piano and delivers the catchiest songs of his career. His songs range from chill inducing ballads to a hilarious song about guy who climbs a tree on acid only to accept Jesus Christ on the way back down. This and other character themes supply the record with its true gems. Without his band behind him, Ben has applied a more polished shell, making his songs ever closer to pop perfection. Ben's songs will be heard forever more whenever there is a piano and a music fan that knows how to play one in the same room.essential tracks - fred jones pt. 2, the ascent of stan, not the same, the luckiest"
5,Very impressed.,"Ben Folds is just as great alone as when he's in a band. This album is so smooth. The music is fantastic in true Folds style, the lyrics are witty and personal, the overall package is perfect. ""Rocking the Suburbs"", the title track, is a great song but it doesn't reflect the tone of the album. This isn't a bad thing though, to hear that song stuck in the middle of the album just reminds you how fun and unpredicatable Folds is. ""The Luckiest"" is the best love song ever written."
5,One of my top five albums of all time!,"Its a strange story how i discovered Ben Folds... I was having a rummage through songs on a particular guitar chords achive and accidently clicked on Ben folds....I had never heard of him and being extremely bored at the time... i tried playing the songs how i thought they would go and then listened to them....and instantly fell in love... Brick was the first song I heard and you'd be surprised how similar my version was before even hearing it! I then searched through everything that had the slightest connection to this songwriting genious....This is by far my favourite album....And it has a pretty damn good chance of being one of my favourites..... of all time....Fave songs.... Gone, Still fighting it, Fred Jones pt2... Annie waits.... oh jesus christ! I love em all!Beautiful piano... delicious vocals..spectacular songs... get this album!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,the best,"absolutely the best cd ever. if you have loved at least one of ben folds five's cds, youll be pleasantly amazed. It is already my fave out of his previous cds. a little like ben folds five eponymous, a little like whatever and ever amen, a little like messner, and a whole lot of different and new and original ben. Simply put...the best"
4,Ben Folds proves himself again,"Just got the album and enjoyed it very much. All the tracks keep the same style that BFF originated but with Ben now playing most of the instruments. The recording is very tight and not sloppy. If you like any of the previous albums or Ben's solo stuff, you will like this.-fan # 1"
5,Without exaggeration- the best album I have ever heard.,"I'm a 24 year-old guy who has heard hundreds of albums. This, without any doubt, is the best I own. I got an advance copy from someone at Warner Brothers about two months ago. During the two months I have come to appreciate this complex, fun, and profound album. The Album has the sound of ""The Autobiography of Reinhold Messner"" only far more advanced. Each song has several layers and parts- there is no verse-chorus-verse-chorus. Listen to a few tracks here on Amazon and then see for yourself. I've given a copy to several of my friends, all of whom fell in love with it as quickly as I did."
5,Ben Folds Proves His Mastery of Music,"What can I say? Ben Folds has produced a cd in ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" that not only surpasses any other recent release in quality, but also propells him to the same category as music greats such as Billy Joel. This is far and away his best album yet, and that's saying quite a bit considering his previous masterpieces. ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" is a necessity for any true music lover."
2,Ben Folds has talent but bad language.,"Some of the songs on this album are excellent (The Lucky One, for example), but I was disappointed with how much profanity there is in this CD. Would not recommend."
5,Heart and Soul in digital form,"It is too bad that BF5 had to break up for such a beautiful compliation of songs to come about.Every track is great, from the white-boy hiphop of Rockin' to the incredibly moving melody and lyrics of ""the Luckiest"".It is an album you can throw in your cd player, hit continuous play, and enjoy all day.I thought the BF5's first album was an incredible debut, but this solo debut is a must have for all fans of singer songwriters, or any one with a pulse.Each song is a story, most include characters names, each song reminded me of someone I knew. Perhaps you can say the same."
5,Don't Lose Hope For Talent,"Convinced that rock has been murdered by boy bands and hip hop? Fear not! True talent can still survive in the marketplace, and Ben Folds is proof. Since I bought this album three weeks ago, I rarely listen to anything else. I might put something on for a change (like the new Elton, also excellent), but I must return to this by the end of the day. Perfect pop. Simply put. This release reminds me of another favorite, but defunct band, Jellyfish. Its like a phrase I've heard before, if you've heard Ben Folds, you're a fan. Play this for all your friends! Buy it as a Christmas gift for people you like! People who love music should do everything they can to support acts like Ben Folds."
3,Decent But Dull First Solo Album,"Ben Folds has always had a unique style to his music. Onfortunately, it sometimes seems that Ben can't break out of it, and the result is that many of his songs sound the same. ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" is no exception. There are a number of standout tracks: ""The Ascent of Stan,"" ""Still Fighting It,"" and ""Not the Same,"" but many of the others sound too alike to bother listening to more than once. The novelty of the title track (a humorous attack on modern rock) wears off very quickly, and the repetitiveness of the ""character songs"" (""Losing Lisa,"" ""Carrying Cathy,"" etc.) really brings the album down.The 3-star rating is not intended to say that the songs are bad, merely that there are too many of the same thing. In the end, whether you will like this album depends on whether you like the standard ""Ben Folds"" style. If you do, you'll love this album; if you don't, there's nothing new or interesting enough here to change that opinion."
5,Hm....Amazing? I think so.,Wow Ben Folds is a beast. This cd is grrrrreat. Buy it. Even if you don't like Ben Folds (which is impossible).
5,Another Spectacular Work from Ben Folds,"I must agree with the other reviewers here. I'm amazed at Ben Folds' ability to always deliver a fresh and inventive set of tracks. This album continues in the great tradition of Ben Folds Five albums. I also was taken aback by the breakup of the group after having loved ""Messner"" so dearly. In any case, this is an excellent CD and guaranteed to fix your Ben Folds needs. I'm currently enjoying ""Gone"" as we speak.You won't be disappointed; I know that I wasn't."
4,who says going solo is hard?,"this cd was burned for me when i was in seventh grade, i am now a sophmore in highschool and i just listened to it last March and immediality fell in love with it, no kidding iwht that i went and saw ben with guster and rufus wainwright this summer:). but what a great cd, ben's writing is so fanastic it warms your heart, cheer you up, and make life worth living. i usually listen to ben when i'm pretty down and then i am pretty much cured after it. after this cd i own ben's disco(minus super d) and ben folds five disco(minus unauthorized biography) and i love them all."
3,Ben Folds- Rockin the Suburbs,"Rockin the Suburbs is a pretty good album. Realistically its probably about 3 and a half stars. There are some really good songs on this album. Tracks like ""Annie Waits"", ""Losin Lisa"", and ""Gone"" stand out. However, there are 2 major complaints I have about this album. The first complaint I have are there are too many ballads. After a while all of the slow songs just mesh together and you cant even differentiate one from the other. My second complaint is the title track, ""Rockin the Suburbs"". First off--this is a silly song and shouldnt have been chosen as the first single. Second off, I cant agree with Ben's message that African Americans are always picking on him. However, musically this album is still above average and is worth picking up if you can deal with spiritless ballads and his imaginated and exagerrated racists fears."
1,Title track totally unlike the rest of the CD,"I should have guessed what the style of music, from the Ben Folds Five track ""Brick"" that was popular a couple of years ago, but I really dug the title track, ""Rockin the Suburbs"" so bought the CD. The rest of the disc is simplisticly and syrupy POP. I feel like I would have done better to buy N'sync or something. Sorry, Ben, but I hated it."
5,"Magnificent, moving","I loved the CD right away, but after seeing Ben live, I realize that he's outdone himself this time (and that's saying a lot). In concert he did every single song from Rockin' the Suburbs - not a dud in the bunch. ""Fred Jones"" and ""Still Fighting It"" are nothing less than classics. Powerful CD - don't miss it."
4,Ben Folds matures....,"Half the fun of the original Ben Fold Five trio was the combination of a band made of a blend of rock & jazz piano, grunge bass guitar, and solid drumming with provocitive and witty songwriting. Apparently, Ben Folds has moved past that in his new solo album. While there are glimmers of the old days (""Rockin The Suburbs""), he writes of the lonely single woman (""Annie Waits""), the realism of growing up (""Still Fighting It""), the laid off employee (the painfull and beautiful ""Fred Jones""), and suicidal friends (""Carrying Cathy""). yet Ben Folds still incorporates the main and best musical elements from his days with the Five to make the album a captivating collection of tunes."
5,Rockin' the Suburbs-Yes it does!!,"If your like me, then you'll jump at the chance to hear yet another collection of songs by Ben. If not, then your certainly missing out on an album which continues where they left in '99 with The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner, an album thought by many to be there best. So any effort, even more so as a solo artist bettering this is quite special. For me, track 10 Rockin' the Suburbs is almost a summary of why I like Bens music so much. It manages to poke fun at himself while potentially addressing a serious issue and has a beat and sound unlike any other band. Okay, so this track is unique on an album of pianoesque songs similar to Mess and Brick, but even if you don't know these songs, but like Rockin the Suburbs, its an album worth considering."
5,Great CD,I love this CD. This is one of the CD's that you can like every song on the album. It is one to have in any collection.
5,ben is rockin my suburb,"I love his voice, lyrics, piano talent, and just the way he combines rock and jazz and other things I can't think of names for. Seriously if you have never heard of ben folds before just listen to him please. He is my favorite pianist. I was lucky enough to see him live, and now I experience all the music with a new perspective. And if you play piano, I recommend also purchasing the piano book for this album."
3,Nothing new here...,"Just another rip-off of Todds work by the record companies. They are just re-releasing all of the old stuff again to make more money on his work. The music is good as usual for Todd, but some of the new stuff would be nice..."
3,catchy but pointless,Probably a good cd to give people who are infamiliar with Todd and who would enjoy his hits without all the esoteric bits which fans like myself really like. A couple of the versions actually improve on the original recording by giving a much fuller music scape (eg. mated). It is actually quite an enjoyable c.d. to listen to but you could get a similar effect by doing your own compilation. Reconstructed had a purpose as it reinterpreted Todd's music for today's audiences. This c.d. has nothing new particularly to offer.
2,Just Read Proust,"No book as good as In Search of Lost Time needs a reading plan. Books like Shattuck's, while not without interest, create a silly mystique about texts which are quite approachable on their own.Bottom line: if you're looking up this book and reading this review, you can read and enjoy Proust without help. If you find that In Search of Lost Time is too confusing or boring (rather than the invigorating, funny, moving spectacle it struck me as being) then stop and read something else. It's OK if it's not your sort of book. How to's and guides are for people who would rather talk about a book or be seen holding a copy in public than actually settle down and read it."
3,Shattuck on Proust,"First effort was unsuccessful, used copy with underlines, this is the second copy which is clean and arrived on time."
4,Worthwhile CD for Teachers,"I bought this CD to help me with one of my classes and found it very helpful in teaching the novel. I usually create my own material but this time the expenditure was worth it. The disk contains vocabulary exercises, quizs, tests, and many things that reinforce what teachers try to do. This CD is practical, solid and takes a traditional teaching approach. It's easy to use and very well organized, leaving it up to the teacher to provide the inspiration and creativity to ignite young minds."
1,Material doesn't match grade level of students.,"This unit was disappointing. Although it there were a few useful ideas for some projects, the study/review questions are much too elementary. Any student at the level where they would be reading this particular book would not be challenged or interested by the questions. The unit plans barely scratch the surface of the material and only target a superficial understanding of the novel and characters. It's hard enough living on a teacher's salary, making the wasted 17 dollars sting that much more. I wish I could get a refund for this product."
2,not really that compelling,"Recommended by Time-legend Stephen Baxter as ""The new century'smost compelling SF voice"" I had to read this Robert Reed book.But somehow I didn't find it an epic of breathtaking scope andboundless imagination. Instead much of it felt like somethingI had heard before. Left me without the kick of discovery.-Simon"
4,Fun Pranks,"Amusing story of twin brothers separated from parents durning an ""accident"" at sea. As the boys struggle to creatively survive on their own, they get into humorous situations. The illustrator, Richard Egielski, especially added to the humor with character rich paintings that give clues to the boys' fate."
4,Fast paced reading,"Jordan is a private eye in Latching on the coast of England. This sixth book in the Jordan Lacey series starts with Jordan being hired to find stolen Chihuahua puppies and stolen fishing rods. Things escalate rapidly to a dead fisherman, Jordan almost drowning under the pier, being involved in a car accident which is an insurance scam and being kidnapped and left locked in a basement that sometimes floods. In her spare time, she runs a little shop, First Class Junk.Like the other reviewers, I, too, am a little concerned with the ending, but will wait and see what the seventh book brings.You'll like Jordan and her friends. Recommended."
5,"School House Rock, Classic....","If you are like my self, when you were a kid in the 70's, you could not wait to get out of bed on Saturday mornings to watch tv. Mixed in with all those great tv shows were the School House Rock segments. As a kid I loved them, and now as an adult, I still love them, and always will. Buy the Official Guide To School House Rock. Read it, and take a trip back in time when everything was right with the world. You were a kid, enjoying classic tv, and learning your multiplication tables, and how bills became laws, and what adjectives and verbs were. School House Rock is classic tv at its best...."
2,Not so great...but perhaps you should get it,"This is a poor prep book content wise. The apporach on the material is very dry and boring, not any more interesting than a text book. For good content I would suggest ""Modern European History,"" by Viault. The practice tests and questions are not at all like the AP test, and won't give you a good idea of the score. teh questions are much less interpretive the the AP test. And personally, i scored much higher on the 2 actual Ap tests that I took prior to the 2002 exam. The sampel essay questiosn are actuallyt he only good part of this book and are very much in line with Ap style. But, many of the DBQs and much more complicated and ridiculous than the real ones. I ended up getting a 5(no thanks to this book)"
5,Perfection,"I have always been skeptical of the outrageous ""wine connoisseur"" type of reviews for high-end audio equipment, and lived for about 4 years with an entry-level, store-brand receiver from Best Buy and a pair of Wharfedale Anniversary 7 series speakers in my library. A friend was disposing of a pair of small HK speakers for $25 and I snapped them up. The sound was much improved, but still wasn't right, and I decided to upgrade to an HK 3380 receiver. The difference was like night and day. I listen to a lot of chamber music, and the sound of violins was particularly bad with the original setup. The HK combination provides crystal clear sound.The unit I had gave off a ""burn-in"" kind of smell for several weeks after I installed it, but since then it has been fine."
4,HK3380,this was just the reciever to go with my bose 901 series IV speakers I was able to plug the eq into the pre amp so that it worked with all the components
4,worth it,"my 70's pioneer finally died,this one has all the same features, turntable hook-up,simple to use and while it has a remote, you can actually walk up to it and hit a button and go. i'm not an audiophile purist but as far as sound quality it sounds great to me and powers some really heavy speakers well. the only draw back is that for some reason it smells like burned plastic initally, stinks up the whole room but after a few days it has started to subside. i recommend this particularly at this price"
2,2 inches short,"I ordered the 18 inch chain for a pendant I received from a friend. While it is nice looking, the chain including the clasp was actually only 16 inches long. While the shipping was fast, I did contact the company about the length of this chain and have received no response from them in the 3 days since I've received the order and contacted them. As someone with a 15 inch neck, a 16 inch chain is a little close for comfort."
1,Broke Right Away,"I had bought this chain for a specific pendant, hoping to enhance the look of both by putting them together. The first time I took the chain over my head to take it off (which you can do with this length) it broke about 1/8"" from the endpiece. I contacted the seller through Amazon, and THEY OFFERED A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT; Their response was timely and professional. Unfortunately, ""life"" has happened again and my 30 day time limit has run out. My fault. It was a good looking snake chain."
1,Poor Quality,This item is already turning and kinking. Very poor quality. I would love to return it.
5,silver charm,"When I saw this chain, I was amazed at the shine, and quality. I gave this chain as a gift. I love it!"
3,Pretty,"Pretty... hard to mess up a silver chain, however, after wearing it I realized it was pulling out my hair around the clasp. Then after about 3 to 4 uses, the clasp broke. Need I say more..."
4,Very pleased.,"I needed a chain for a cameo I have, I ordered this one and it is perfect. Well constructed, pretty and functional. I shipped and arrived in good shape. I got here in a timely manner..........."
4,SILVER CHAIN,This is a quality chain. Very sturdy. The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the clasp is too small. It take a bit of effort over and over again to hook/unhook it to get it off and on unless you have very tiny hands and skinny fingers.
1,It broke,It broke after a month of limited wearing. I was just taking it off and it broke in the chain not the clasp.
1,Chain,"I ordered a 30"" silver chain from this place for my wife's anniversary and the chain was only 17"" long. Talk about getting into trouble, she said that I don't pay attention, that I don't know what she likes, that I don't know her sizes...what a mess this made. And I have attempted to contact the seller on several occasions but no reply. Really disappointed with this seller... I have never had this problem with Amazon, I am a card caring member and this time...it made a mess of things. I have no idea what my recourse is."
5,Just right,I purchased two of these as presents for my teens. They are very sturdy. They carry the weight of heavy pendants. They are good quality chains. I am very pleased.
5,Silver chains,"The 1mm Sterling Silver 24"" Italian Snake Chain Necklace is a white silver and very pretty. A good buy all around. I love it!Thanks. Mrs. L Davis"
4,"Simple, elegant and beautiful, if a bit frail-looking","The chain surprised me by how thin it was, as I have never worn a necklace before and expected something ""stronger"" but since I don't intend to go kickboxing with it there shouldn't be any problems though. The lobster clasp appears very delicate and can sometimes be hard to manipulate (open/close). Note that I haven't worn necklaces before so my assertion of the ""small clasp"" might be a bit off. What I like about it is that it is simple, so I feel it could fit with pretty much any pendant I wanted to wear. Also, kudos on the fast overseas standard delivery (less than 2 weeks).Edit 26.01.2009. - my worries very completely unfounded, I haven't had any problems with the chain so far and it's working great! The clasp is easy to manipulate after you adjust to it too."
5,Exactly as expected,"I bought this chain to go with a silver horse charm as a gift. It is exactly as described; shipped promptly and in a nice black velvet drawstring bag that made it especially nice for a gift. Good price, good quality."
3,Be Warned- Length Includes clasp!,"Great product- really pretty and high quality! I ordered the 16'' to replace a similar chain I had that was also 16''. This is entirely too short as the length includes the clasp. I am exchanging for the 18'' chain, which should be perfect. Nothing wrong with the item, really a great quality, just be aware of the length...."
4,A+,All 3 disc's keep you goin. I listened to everything for a month straight. All the songs flow together making it a non stop rock baby! I'd recommend buying
2,"If you have enough money, don't buy this one","Everything is very fragile,esp the black vinyl part.I broke 9 out of 10 when I tried to open the case for back inserts.Don't expect it is of the same quality as the one you purchased with music cd. It is of much inferior quality."
3,Cheap But Appreciated,"More and more computer products are being packaged with their software CDs in paper sleeves rather than jewel cases, driving my need to buy blank jewel cases. While thin cases are abundant, it is getting harder and harder to find full size CD jewel cases. Personally, I highly prefer the full size cases as they allow you to write software/album title on the spine, making it much easier to look through multiple cases stored on a shelf. I therefore much appreciate that Memorex is still making and selling these. However, as others have mentioned, they are of poor quality. Most every one of them will break when attempting to pull them apart to install backside labels/inserts."
2,Tiger - The Authorized DVD Collection,"Really disappointed in this set. Far too much fluff and not enough substance here. Was looking forward to the clinic, but there was nothing there of exception. You can find most of this footage on the Channel. My advice? If you must see this: Rent don't buy. Not worth $50, and probably not worth half as much used."
4,Great for Tiger Fans,"This is not a 5 star product, unfortunately. I love watching Tiger each week, but this DVD collection could have been a lot better, given what he has done in his career. There are good gems about how he was raised, and how he gets into the zone while playing, but there is a lot of ""fluff"" considering the person they are talking about. By fluff, I mean praise for Tiger Woods instead of good content. They could have done a lot more in the way of teaching golfers how to get better. It's more of a documentary and bio than anything that will improve your game a ton.At $9 used, its worth it for any true Tiger fan, but don't pay much more for it."
1,What is this Hype?,"The undercurrent of lies is showingRather, much of a set up just to look goodOh, brotherPathetic"
4,"Titans, GO ! (again...)","Here it is, season two, volume one of Teen Titans now on DVD. Like I said before, this one's entitled ""Fear Itself."" It's the episode where Raven admits she is afraid of some things. Especially after Beast Boy rents a horror flick.Other episodes include Starfire travelling to a dark and dismal future, Beast Boy being mistaken for an alien's pet, Cyborg versus a robotic adversary, and the first appearance of an earth-moving Titan named Terra. All of these episodes have a few ""wacky"" anime-like moments like the other episodes on previous DVDs, but not as ""wacky"" as the episode where Robin goes on a blind - and I mean blind - date.Special extras in this DVD include the ""Arachnid Challenge"" game and a look inside Titans Tower.If you have or planning to buy any of the two first season DVDs, get this one as well."
2,A disappointment,"As a big fan of Urge Overkill, and particularly Nash Kato's songs (I always liked his voice over the more gruff, less melodic King Roeser), Debutante is a huge disappointment. Maybe King wrote the melodies, since outside of the somewhat catchy Zooey Suicide, this CD is entirely devoid of them.All that's left is some decent riffage, a few clever lyrics, some great singing (by Kato and his backup singers), a lot of attitude, but no memorable songs."
1,"He looks cool, but . . .",". . anyone who has seen Nash live knows that he is uh. . . not good. His career highlight, Urge Overkill's ""Saturation,"" was a fluke. ""Debutante"" confirms it. I wish he were a stock, so I could short him."
5,Well written!,I found this book easy to follow and clear enough to help me find funds for my school. The accountant for our district also used this book as a reference for other projects.
5,top notch,John Wayne. God. War in Monument Valley. The Preacher--Jesse Custer. Cannibalism. Irish vampire. Starr. Betrayal. Sex. Cigarettes. Chicks with guns.This volume is about as good as it gets.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Hilarious background on a major antagonist, detailing the utter and total insanity of their organisation. This is one of the weirdest, most screwed up villains you can imagine. He loses body part after body part, function after function, and has indignity upon indignity heaped upon him and still continues upon his crazed quest and towards his nutjob goals."
5,They did it again.,"Damn. Not only does this book offer an incredible look into the past of Starr (the German Grail member who became Allfather in book 3), it also shows an incredible showdown between Starr's forces and the Saint. Yet another incredible episode in the Preacher series."
4,Great price on a stock water pump assembly,"This is the best price on the net for this water pump. When I got it, I inspected it and found everything to be in order, except that the gaskets were bent and unusable (which is why I docked a star). I contacted the seller, who said they came that way from Delco. The seller then credited me towards the purchase of replacement gaskets. Other buyers will most likely not face this issue. In my opinion, the seller did well given the low price. They may even have taken a loss to make this right. Good for them.I installed the pump and it's working like a champ."
5,Sweet deal,"I ordered this on Amazon.com, very good deal. The unit came with the thermostat and housing already attached, easy install - about one hour."
3,Broke the first day,"This is not a very durable toy. It broke the first day we had it. We took it apart and found that some of the plastic teeth on one of the gears had snapped off. This meant that the motor could no longer reset the pins. It was a lot of fun when it was working, but not sure we'd buy from this company again. Take note that some of the other bowling games by this company work OK without breaking down. Also take note that you could buy this game if you want to put up with resetting the pins by hand. (To reset the pins by hand, just push or pull the arm located inside the top unit.)Please do not copy this review for use elsewhere on the internet."
3,Ho hum quality and poor return policy,I called about this item. My husband thought the quality was poor. I would have to pay for return shipping. This didn't seem fair.
1,Avoid - entire roll perforated by packaging staple,"This was once a good product, now to be avoided. To hold the roll closed, the manufacturer stapled it together, putting holes through the entire roll of tape -- prior purchases of this product were held shut with a small band of tape. At such a small price, it is hard to get the enthusiasm to return it to Amazon, but if I had seen it in the store, I would never have bought a roll of tape that was intentionally damaged at the factory."
5,A Good Read,M. J. Rose keeps the reader interested to the point that they can't put the book down. Each book that she has written I find she gives each character a unique personality. You want to know what will happen in the next chapter with the character. I feel that anyone who picks up one of her books will be happy that they did.
4,A Delicious Read - And a Headache Cure!,"Everyone has already summarized the plot to death, so I won't bother to do that.I will say that this book is a delectable read, a warm bath of dark chocolate, a cello concerto, a rich red wine.I picked this book up one evening when I had a nasty headache and couldn't settle on any book. And within a page or two, the headache was forgotten and my mood had improved. The story is intriguing, the main character is somewhat infuriating but sympathetic, the language is voluptuous. The descriptions of the food and music in this book are almost sexier than the descriptions of the sex...and that's saying something.And when I finished the book, several hours later, I was hugely satisfied and my headache was a thing of the past. An added side benefit."
2,Not my cup of tea,This baffled me. I couldn't understand it at all. I can't read music admittedly. On the plus side I leave it on my coffee table to make me look like an intellectual.
3,Good but not great...,"I like this author but this book was not all that I hoped for. I wouldn't discourage from considering it or even to make the leap and go for the purchase, but keep in mind, good not great."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this video. I have COPD and was looking for some exercises I could do to help. The instructor had some good info, but at first glance at the lit candles in the backgroud, I knew there was no one using oxygen. The woman ""guest"" did not have any breathing problems as she smiles the entire time and does the exercises way ""too"" fast. The biggest problem with following the exercises was not telling when to breathe in and out. I would not recommend this video to COPD patients."
4,Fitness for those who can't breathe so well,"Functional Fitness COPD & Asthma is an easy, slow-paced exercise program which includes important breathing exercises, as well as keeping you aware of your breathing while doing the exercises. I'm so glad I found this helpful DVD."
3,Good start,Helped to get me started in a worthwhile excerise program. Only way to beat this monster illness.....wish I'd NEVER smoked!!!
4,A Strong Collection,"Collected here are Kernberg's papers from the last decade. As is often the case, one wishes he went into further detail and resisted psychoanalytic lingo at times. But one would have to look hard to find a deeper, more humble, more complex psychoanalytic thinker in the world today.If Kernberg had the writing ability of, say, the late Stephen A. Mitchell, his works might find a wider audience. I would like to see a fine writer take up Kernberg's ideas and find a way to communicate them more coherently. Even those well-versed in psychoanalysis may find themselves wishing for a clearer articulation of how Kernberg gets from A to B.That said, this is a rigorous and exciting collection."
4,Edge of your icy seat...,"I am not a book reader... In fact, this is the only book I've read in the last 2 years. Forced to stay indoors in blizzard conditions on a 1998 ski trip, I found a tattered copy of Cobra Dane in the community lounge, and had a ""flick"" through it... 3 days, and several bottles of bourbon later, I'd finished the book, and was left wanting a sequel. It is a great book! A real thriller, that is truly believable..."
4,fighting the cold war,"Cobra Dane was an important radar site during the cold war, located on the island of Shyemya Alaska. I personally related to it because I was in the air force then as a radar operator."
3,Not bad not amazing,A good read but some doesn't make sense seems like the premise is good but the idea of the whole island eing infiltrated is hard to believe
1,A real fake,"Having spent 3 years on Shemya as Cobra Dane was being installed, I looked forward to this book. The cover is not Shemya. Shemya has very low elevation terrain, no arctic features and no radar dish as shown. The story is an equal disappointment. I couldn't follow the action around the island and just gave up. John Campbell is trying to be Tom Clancy 2. He fails that in this book.Charles StanfordLiverpool, NY"
2,Poor Recoloring,"I have the original copy of What If? 3 (collected in this book). Let me tell you, this book would of been a lot better if they did not upgrade the coloring. The new coloring is grainy. The original coloring was much better."
5,Van Der Graaf Generator with balls,"I like all of this groups older stuff from the 70's and with Fripp's contributions as well. I have Godbluff live and can sit through that DVD all the way through and enjoy every part. David Jackson was integral to the initial VDG sound which borders on jazz/rock fusion but of course progrock is where most people consider their niche.This DVD without Mr. Jackson's talents reminds more of a harder edged rock, forgive my comparison but somewhat like Atomic Rooster, maybe even a little Uriah Heepish (hows that for an adverb). Anyway, I do sit through this entire DVD as easily as Godbluff live.I am very happy that I have two snapshots of the same band in very different eras and in very different forms musically.Hopefully more material of these guys will come out."
1,The Very Best of Walter Hawkins,"It April 17, 2009. I have not received this item. (The very Best of Walter Hawkins)I am requesting a refund for this item."
2,"Great video, but the subtitles are hard to read","The videos are great, but the one drawback is that the subtitles roll too rapidly. Put simply, it is hard to watch for an adult and impossible for children to follow. I am still looking for a better video to use to preview Poland for my children before I take them there this winter."
4,multi backpacks,This is a great backpack. It has plenty of pockets. It is a smaller version of one that I use for myself. Great price!
2,"Nice, but needs better hardware","As a scoutmaster, I purchased several of these for our new scouts (10-11 years old) and it is great for that size boy up to probably 13 or 14 years old. I liked everything about the pack except for the cheap plastic used on the strap adjustments. When the boys pulled hard enough to cinch up the straps, the plastic shattered."
4,Great pack for pre-teens,"After an internal frame youth pack was a bust, I tried this for my average size 10 year old daughter. It's been great. Plenty of room and, despite looking like it's a little large for her, is still easy for her to handle. Most importantly, she says it's comfortable. After three multi-day outings it's still in great shape."
5,Great starter backpack,"I just got this for my nephew and he loves it. He's a big 11-year-old, but the pack fits him on its lowest setting, so it can grow with him over time."
4,Make this record your Mistress!,"A perfect word to describe this record would be ""fantastic."" It sounds, in some moments like something out of the Shire or the grounds of Hogwarts. There are no pan flutes or mandolins, but the boy/girl vocals sound somewhat prepubescent and endearing,like a woodnymph or a satyr singing in a forest. The combination of femininity and artistic approaches to what can be a very mechanical process make the recordings sound very organic, even when samples and synth-sounds flourish and crescendo in the background. These three artists made my flight from San Francisco to Anchorage feel both melancholy and promising. I am haunted by this album (in the best way possible) and I blame Galadriel."
4,Great compositions and performances,"This is a wonderful, understated album I can't recommend highly enough. The playing on the album is excellent, and the growth of the band is immediately apparent to anyone who has followed them for any length of time.There are instances when the heaps of strings tend to overwhelm the songs, and some of the tunes reach too far and grow ponderous.The faults pale in comparison to the beauty of songs like ""Elephant Woman"" and the title track. Enjoy!"
5,Seductively Haunting,"This is a lovely album that eases into the internal soul effortlessly. The mixing is perfect and the strings provide a poetic background. I saw them last nite at the Black Cat in DC - one of my favorite shows in recent times. Kazu and Amando make love on stage with their stares, motions towards one another, and chilling words. This band just keeps getting better, which is so rewarding in this era of mediocrity. Each album is a progression into different soundscapes and emotions. While their sounding like Sonic Youth never bothered me, I'm glad to hear them fully step out of the shadow. This is not Sonic Youth or like anything else out there. Its distinct, dreamy, and daring."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I have to agree with pretty much everything that reviewer Dan Manning said about this album. This, to me, was the biggest disappointment of the year. BR is an incredible band. Their live performances have blown me away and I've loved every album that they made--until ""Misery.""But ""Misery"" is an absolutely droll, even, yes, downright boring effort by BR. Virtually every song plods along at about the same speed. Further, ""Misery"" hides the guitars and drums way in the background--many of the songs are less like songs themselves than excuses to structure boring harpsichord loops and melodies.I'm not calling this album a ""sell out"" or anything like that. I've got nothing but respect for BR and their long-time producer Guy Picciotto--one of the true hero's of indie rock.IMO BR has finally laid an egg after a long string of gems."
5,one of a kind,"This album is what I have been waiting to hear since, maybe, ""OK Computer"". I've been disapointed with music lately, but Blonde Redhead gave me back hope. If you feel that it's been a while since you don't hear anything great, this is your album."
4,I just love this book!,I laughed a lot reading this book.It gave me a good review of the strong points of America.Every American should read it.Funny it took a canadian to pomp-up American pride.
4,great as long as it stays there,"Like mentioned in the other review, this works great as long as it stays there. Somehow the first one disappeared on a trip. Second one has stayed in place so far. Really does a good job at drawing away tank odor."
5,Nostalgia,Thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous photography of my childhood haunts- I went to grammar school in the Cook Forest area and not long ago when a friend was planning to visit for the first time I handed her this book (I work in a library) as a preview-she was hooked. Mr. Cook has captured all the untouched magic of Pennsylvania forests and packaged it up so we can all carry about a bit of solitude in our busy lives.
2,Concur - really bad tie-in,"As others have noted, the tie-in is really misleading. You get only one episode that has anything to do with Star Wars, and that only half-way in. The other episodes are decent ones, but at least know you are not really getting anything that has much to do with Star Wars.A much nicer idea would have been a montage made with bits from other episodes that were Star-Wars related, along with the Mark Hamil episode."
1,Don't waste your money,"*SO* cheesed off at Fox. The episodes they included have nothing to do with Star Wars. The box is misleading. I would have been happier if they would have at least included episodes about Kang and Kodos, at least they have a spaceship."
1,Bart Wars is a ripoff,"Looking at the cover and the spoof title (and the inside sheet and the DVD menus!), one would think that the episodes chosen have SOMETHING to do with Star Wars. However, you will be sorely disappointed if you expect even a hint of connection with Star Wars save for the last episode with Mark Hamill (which is a classic in my opinion). Being a Star Wars and a Simpsons fan, I was hoping for ANYTHING more than what I got with Bart Wars. I was very disappointed...."
2,Not what i expected,When i bought this video i thought i was getting something i had never seen before.Something in reference to the picture in the front cover. But instead i got 4 episodes of the old simpsons series where bart was the main character;Mayored to the MobDog of DeathThe Secret War of Lisa SimpsonMarge Be Not ProudIn other words dont judge a book by its cover or in this case the dvd by is cover.
4,Wars,I liked this DVD but if people would please forget about star wars this DVD is about WARS not Star Wars.Mayored to the Mob-Star wars and Mob warsThe Secret War of Lisa Simpson-army training AKA War training.Dog of Death-Mr Burns trains Santas Little Helper against humans AKA Dogs VS Humans War.Marge Be Not Proud-Barts war with the store manager and Marges war against Bart.I hope you now understand that this DVD is about WAR.
3,Has nothing to do with Star Wars,"As mentioned by other reviewers (and if I had taken the time to read them before ordering it) this movie is just 4 short episodes of the Simpsons that are available on the full season discs. Once my boy eagerly pointed out the Star Wars theme of the DVD cover, I ordered it without looking further, believing that it was a Star Wars take off such as Family Guy has made. My mistake and only have myself to blame for being in such a rush. It is being returned unopened. The cover art is VERY misleading, but it is clearly stated in the DVD details what is on the DVD."
3,Misleading but still fun,"I was expecting Star Wars related episodes here but all it got was the episode with Mark Hamill that I seen a dozen times already. Anyways this compilation did help me remember why I used to love the Simpsons so much. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" and ""The Secret War of Lisa"" were not only really funny but kinda touching as well. This is the cool thing about earlier episodes, they managed to be irreverent but also affectionate."
1,Why?,"I don't think its a good idea to make a DVD that goes along with star wars, because ONE: THESE EPISODES ARE REALLY JUST 22 MINUTES, and 2: Becuase these episodes have nothing to DO with star wars!! So why buy it if your a star wars fan??? You will be dissapointed, becuase these are regualar episodes of the simpsons. NOTHING TO DO WITH STAR WARS!!!"
1,Huge dissapotinemt!,"I think it is rather shameful of fox to mis-represent what this DVD is. They call it Bart Wars, and put Darh Vader on the cover why is it unreasonable to buy it expecting the Star-Wars episodes of THe SImpsons? They are not bad episodes (So Please don't send a letter to Foz about me whoever writes those ""a Kid's Review"" But Fox should be ashamed for trying to rip off the fans and decieving us like this. The only rason to buy this is if you can't wait for the eventual Box Set of their respective Season. Otherwise, if you do buy it you are just getting another hastily thrown together DVD to keep us (the fans) at bay until they can catch up On the Season Box sets. Best to make your own opinion really...."
3,Simpsons- Bart Wars,"I've owned this collection for 6 years now, it was released in 1999 here in the UK; (we tend to get alot of these collection dvds, it seems the uk market are willing to pay for them.) Obviously as a cash in with the release of episode 3, they've decided to release it in the USA.However there are some good episodes and it is still the Simpsons, and these episodes are from the time when it was at the top of its game.Wait till they come out on the box sets."
1,This is the worst one yet.,I love the Simpsons but this dvd was awful. First they called it Bart Wars and it had nothing to do with Star Wars. Then the episodes wern't that good so you get tired of them really fast if you watch for a second time. There are only 4 episodes so you could go out spend $10 more and buy a season with 25 episods. it was just not good. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I feel cheated,I bought this DVD because I thought it would contain spoof's of Star Wars for my son. He and I both thought that was on there and both of us were terribly disappointed (a 7 year old does not understand about marketing)I am appalled that Fox would sink this low and deliberately try to cheat people.. If I want to see the Simpsons we turn on the TV! I for one now have a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Fox and I will never ever buy another DVD from them. (it is not the money I spend .. it is the principal that a company took advantage of people and stoop so low)
1,Unsatisfied,The DVD didn't even come in the original packing. It was just in a regualar CD jewel case. I'm going to have to buy another copy just to complete my Simpson's set!!!
1,Expensive Brand-Name Ibuprofen,"So, drugs are drugs. The generic version of ibuprofen has to be chemically identical to a brand name product. The only allowable differences are coatings and colors.So, why not buy the generics? The top Amazon.com search result for ""ibuprofen"" had 750 tablets for $12, and qualifies for Amazon Prime.I'm rating this item a 1 out of 5 for delivering a horrible value."
3,Good deal if price stayed the same,"Good price for this product, but the price seems to change each time I check the listing. And not by just a few pennies. Please keep it reasonable."
5,China Made Generics,The generic Advill is much cheaper due to the fact it is manufactured in china. China has very slack quality control processing. Be wary of what you put in your mouth.
5,"I read this book, it made me decide to join the Gurkhas","There is no better account of what it is like to serve in the Gurkhas, the legendary mercenary force of central Asian mountain tribes employed in regular service in the British Army. Despite the communist leanings of British governments since 1945 and the consequent efforts to remove these soldiers from the British Army's order of battle, there are still Gurkha units in the British Army, and the spirit described in this account lives on."
3,A little disappointing,Not quite up to par with the other micro playsets. There's very little for a child to do with it.
5,The best book I've read on dolphins in a LONG time!!,Dolphin Chronicles is a wonderful story about Carol J. Howard's adventure with dolphins. Her book was so well-written that I felt like I was actually participating in her events. I am only thirteen years old but it the best book I have read in my life. I now want to be a marine biologist and dedicate my life to researching and caring for dolphins. Thank you Carol for writing such a wonderful book
1,A hack job.,Mr. Waggett churns these trite books out to hear the sound of his own voice. He has little to add to what we already know about daytime drama and this book is no exception.
2,Poor specs,"I was interested in this product for a couple of reasons: color, frequency range, and price. As far as I have been able to tell, all of those features are spot on. What was not was Amazon's 'Does this fit your car?' feature. The hole pattern does not line up with the factory mounts in my Honda del Sol and the magnet is too large to fit, anyways. I will be able to make it work with a custom adapter ring, but this is not a solution for everyone. I strongly advise anyone looking at speakers to steer clear of these. They are not as advertised."
1,terrible farting junk,"purchased these for my MINI..omg all that work and I miss my factory speakers. As soon as I installed them the started having a high verberation NEVER AGAIN. Please dont wase your time. Purchase something else like stock, HUH, yup I said it. Any thing is better even a cheap walmart brand."
1,What a lesson,"I paid attention to the other reviews and purchased these speakers.I wasted my time and money.Simply put....Worst speakers I have ever owned.BTW,This is the second time I have posted a review,it would appear as if they are being profiled with only the positive making it to the list."
4,good replacement speakers good sound,good replacement sound much better than oem i do recomend these... sound much better with aftermarket stereo... good for the price
3,The finishing touch - a touch of comedy,"The film is wonderful and worth seeing - the quality and price are just right for my collection of L&H films.The boys build a house - if you can call it that.Released Febraury 25, 1928 the film is not dated in the fact that builders are builders even today.With side kick Edgar Kennedy as a cop the boys are at their best. Their usual method of destruction with comic over tones can be seen here with the throwing of rocks and stepping and swollowing of nails. It is an above average entry rated 3 out of 4 derbies by the L&H books and rates high also by the scholars. Of many of the newer releases it is an average print quality and can be easy on the eyes unlike some of the films I've viewed that are of this same era.For fans of the team this is a Great addition."
5,Oh Wow!,"I rate this product five stars. This baklawa is delicious and unfortunately did not last long because I ate the whole damn box in three days. No self control, I guess. It had been three years since I had any baklawa and boy oh boy was this good."
1,very poor quality stuff,"After reading reviews about Baklawa-w/Walnuts in amazon.com, I also ordered for one package, my seniors and co-workers liked it. I ordered for 3 more packages that were sent out to my friends in different cities, everyone liked this Baklawa. However last week, I decided to order for 2 packages of Baklawa (Baklava) w/Pistachios, believe me no body liked it.You would think that this stuff should be as good as other stuffs made of Pistachios,but no way--just a wastage of money. I feel sorry for spending about 35 dollers on this poor quality product without any taste.I don't know if the pistachios used in this product is of low quality or what is the problem??."
1,do not order this!,I never recieved this item and they kept my money!!!!! i sent many emails none were returned! i feel robbed!!
3,Great pictures but not a lot of info.,"I got this book for christmas. I have been wanting a new book on sterling silver since I am advancing my collection. I liked the many pictures in this book and it was intriging. I found several new ideas for what type of pieces I would like to add to my collection but I was dissappointed with what little information this book provides. If you are looking for a good read this isn't the right book, this is more of a photo/price guide for silver novelties."
4,Loads of Luxe,"The only thing I wish was included in this book were more ordinary items the average collector mught come upon.Outside of that, the presentation, the color pages, and the written information is very detailed and sure to please."
5,How does he do it?,"I thought that a formidable follow up to Cheating at Solitaire would be difficult. This album surpasses my expectations and then some. Ness mixes all his influences here along with his own unmistakable style to create an album so full of pure emotion that the listener can't help but be inspired. This album is for anyone who has an appreciation for music. There's country, folk, punk, rock n'roll and pretty much anything else you'd want short of hip-hop. It's all here and it's all perfect. The most amazing thing about it is that it was done so quickly. Does this guy sleep? It seems that I just saw him performing last week and already he has another album on the shelves. Ness is a true musician who appreciates not only his influences but his fans as well. His dedication to himself and to us is unmistakable and unparalleled."
4,A good CD and great concept.,This is a good cd. Mike Ness gives his heart and soul to these old clasic songs. My favorite is his cover of Big Iron. I would first recomend Cheating at Salitaire. Cheating at Salitaire is the best CD I have heard in years. I love the concept of doing the songs that made the music we hear on the radio today. Overal this is a Good follow up to Mike Ness first solo CD.P.S Dennis Danell we will miss you.
1,SD Fan,I am a long time Social Distortion fan. The Mike Ness solo albums are a long way from being half as good as any SD album. I pray SD makes a come back. Mikes career depends on it.
4,Mike goes a little too far...,"I think CHEATING AT SOLITAIRE is one of the best albums of all time. Appearently too many people told Mr. Ness that he should do more of the covers of old country/rockabilly songs. A few tracks on this album are almost Vegas style re-vampings of classics. Like a steak that is just too chewy, but the overall flavor is still great."
4,Mike Does it Again,I enjoyed this CD a lot. The first time I heard big Iron I played it 5x. I would recomend Cheating at solitaire first. If you love every song on that CD you will enjoin Under the Influence.
4,"Worked great, but disintigrates!","I loved this rosin, really I did. Very little dust, great tackyness and produces a wonderful sound. The only problem is that it's *fragile* After just a semester of use, I've barely gotten the top layer off the cake, but the whole thing is cracking and falling apart! It's like it's made of sugar. Since I was the concert master for my highschool orchestra, my tuner and rosin became a class resource. It may be that one of them dropped it and neglected to tell me, so if you do buy guard it with your life. It is worth the price, but only if it's kept in a condition to use it."
3,Decient,This rosin is pretty ok for a step up from standard rosin. I don't think this stuff sticks very well and it sqeaks quite a bit for me.Rosin is usually a personal preference so you may love this rosin or even hate it.
4,Much better than my old rosin!,I love this stuff! The only problem is that it leaves a lot of rosin residue on my strings
2,too fragile,I have just received this rosin 4 days ago and the rosin has broken to pieces. Only one half of the rosin is salvageable. Should have heeded other people's warning about how easy this rosin can break up. Not as soft as anticipated.
4,Pretty good rosin.,"The reason I like it is the lack of residue coating the back of my throat after playing. Some rosins seem to send up a cloud of dust from the strings that I would then inhale. This rosin is better behaved and more refined. Yes, it sounds nice as well and is worth the extra expense."
2,OK.,"At first I agreed with most people. This is a good rosin. It has really good sound and grips pretty well. That was my first opinion. But after prolonged use, I found that the rosin doesn't like to stay on the bow and it creates an excessive amount of dust.I would only recomend this rosin for beginners since it goes for a faily low price."
4,Good Quality and Nice Sound,"This rosin has been with me through high school, college, and into the ""real world."" While I'm not a professional violinist, I've used it in many amateur and community orchestras, as well as in my own playing for pleasure, and it has always done the job. It takes a little while to get into the rosin, past the slick exterior, but it has rosined both old and new bow hair alike and I've never had any issues! I have had better, but I've definitely had a lot worse."
4,Great entry level shoe.,"Love that these come in WIDE. It is tough to locate those for little kids wide feet. My son started taking tap and is having a grand time making noise with these. Real leather ones are nicer, but for feet that grow quickly and knowing they are going to be destroyed during use, this faux stuff works great. Will buy again when the foot grows!"
2,Feels like tough plastic,Not very comfortable feeling.They are very hard and dont flex much at all. We returned this for Leo's Unisex Tap shoes.They were much softer and seemed better made.
5,"Great, but returned","I loved them. They were exactly what I expected, however, I returned them as my grandson decided not to go to dance lessons afterall."
4,Great Little First Tapper,"Great little first tapper. Only suggestion would be to make sure you order narrow if your child has a thin foot. My son's are a little gappy around the heel. Had a little trouble determining size but as long as the big kids are available you can go with street size for the narrow foot and a 1/2 size higher for the wider foot. Great tap sound. No issues with the tap so far. Delivery was great received them in a week to Ontario, Canada address with out paying the extra shipping. Even with duty the shoes were a great price. Definitely will order again next year."
2,you get what you get for the price.,"I'm not sure about the materiel, and when my son taps in it, I don't know how he's supposed to handle the impact from his hill to the spine and his brain."
3,Wide????,If this shoe is a wide I'd hate to see the regular. If it didn't say 9W in the shoe I would have sworn it was a 9N. I will be returned!
3,This Oklahoma is worth listening to,"I have always hated the musical Oklahoma ever since I was a child, to me it was like listening to nails on a blackboard and the story was not interesting. After hearing this cd at a friends house and purchasing it shortly after, I actually want to see Oklahoma with this particular cast. Maybe the reason why I liked this version was because nobody in the cast affected a really bad southern accent like in previous versions. While I still cannot say that I love Oklahoma at least I can say is that I now find it tolerable."
3,Americans do this better.,"Not on a par with the RSC earlier masterpiece revival of Carousel. With the exception of Hugh Jackman,who can't seem to take one wrong step on a stage, this version doesn't compare to the 1979 revival. This cast isn't in the same league as the American cast of Christine Andreas, Martin Vidnovic and particularly Christine Ebersole as Ado Annie."
4,Gatas is always Entertaining,"The entire Gatas series has its moments, nice tunes, nice girls. If you enjoy Gatas, you will also enjoy Fiesta 4 Party. Has both a DVD and CD."
5,hot gatas sandungueras,I like the gatas doing the perreo dance.... good reggaeton music and better girls shaking their boom boom
2,Invitation to Poland,Beautiful photography. These dvd's have English sub titles. Some subtitles change so quickly that one cannot read them all before they change. The speach is so quiet that if you understand Polish you cannot hear the words well enough to understand what is being said.
3,"Over priced, but other wise I like it","This is over priced, just a simple silver pendant. I should have shopped better, the stores sell things like this for half as much."
1,Won't buy jewelry on line again,The pendant was smaller than I expected and the chain was cheesy and not even ten inches long. Luckily I was able to buy a nicer looking chain in time to give the gift but I wouldn't buy jewelry on line again. If I go to the trouble of giving it then I want it to look as good as possibe.
5,Sterling silver Celtic pendant and ear rings,"Both the Celtic ear rings and pendant were just as I expected them to be. My daughter has worn them several times and received compliments. The jewelry is beautifuly made. The chain for the pendant was not quite as long as needed for an adult, but easily replaced."
4,Necklace,The product was of decent quality. Good value for the price and a perfect match for the ear rings purchased earlier.
4,clean simple design,"the pendant was very simple, it looks good in silver. The chain was too small, but can easily be removed and a more substantial one can be used, a black cord would also be very nice subsitution."
4,Nice Piece,This is a decent piece of Jewelery. I gave it as a gift to my girlfriend and she appreciated it. I wouldn't try to pass it off as anything extraordinary.
2,Celtic Pendant,"Much thiner and lighter in weight that it appears in the picture. Ok, but not outstanding."
5,Beautiful design,"I got this as a gift for my mother. I bought this necklace for her, because it was a simple elegant design at a reasonable price."
2,"pretty at first but ""silver"" finish has major issues","My husband bought this for me for my Birthday just this last November(my birthday was thanksgiving), but I didnt even receive it for almost a whole two weeks after my birthday. I wear it everyday but just today, I noticed that it has a very worn appearance. There are little black specks and blackish wear marks (like it's a cheap electroplate, not solid silver)and the finish is actually pitted. I can actually feel the marks, thats how I ended noticing it's appearance. I've only had it 3 1/2 months. I just wear it around my neck. I am a full time student and stay at home mom so my environment isn't a harsh one. I am very sad and disappointed because initially, it was very pretty. Now, it looks like something he just picked up at the dollar store. :~("
2,Made in Thailand. Seems way over priced.,"The picture looks much better than real life. It is very thin, and very light. The chain is even thinner. Although the design is Celtic, it is made in Thailand."
2,Two stars for the Nokia ringtone,"Three complaints;1) Human beatboxing may well be very impressive live, but it really loses it's importance on a studio-produced disk. It just sounds heavily processed, maybe a more live-sounding CD would have done him more justice.2) Don't buy this disk if you cringe and get a shudder down your spine listening to London geezers. I despise The Streets for the same reason; Cockney's 'bigging up themselves' aint music. Sadly, that's all the lyrics encompass. Kela sure does love himself too, track one is four minutes worth of his mates blabbering on about how talented he is. Let us find out for ourselves Norman.3)Long telephone skits aint funny. Kela's credentials went down the pan once I reached this 'track' - alas, he sounds like a complete cretin.:|"
4,Dance Music at it's Best.,"This is an excellent compilation of dance hits. The first three tracks are excellent1. Bodyrock - Moby (Olav Basoski's Da Hot Funk Da Freak Funk remix) 2. Jumbo - Underworld (Future Shock Worlds Apart mix) 3. This Life - Mandalay (Cevin's Main Frame dub)The other tracks didn't catch my attention but are just as good. This cd is House, dance music that will keep your ears and feet interested throughout the CD. I do highly reccommend this CD. All these tracks at a very good price too. Believe me you wont be dissapointed. Take a chance. Thank you for your time on reading my review. I hope it helped."
1,Garbage,This film is not really a film at all. It is a piece of garbage. Don't waste your time. I love watching good horror/slasher films. The director apparently has never seen one.
5,Vincent Price Rules!,"Always fun to see Vinnie and this one had a Jules Verne flavor to it. Good production values for a low-budget film, and the acting was quite good as well."
2,Just how many lost cities ARE there on this planet??,"Overall mediocre movie nevertheless maintains a minimal level of interest due to good production design and genuinely oddball plot. The widescreen print is marred by minor imperfections every few minutes, but is basically in good shape, with rich colors and good sound. I have my doubts that the comic-relief chicken appeared anywhere in the original Poe source material, but I guess worse travesties have been committed in the name of ""artistic interpretation""."
5,great tunes,Shame Unida broke up. If you like this you will love slo-burn. My only complaint is the case was cracked.
4,Unida rocks!,"Unida sounds awesome! John Garcia picks up right where he left off with Slo Burn. The vocals are powerful and the music has an amazing heavy groove to it. A must have for any Kyuss or stoner rock fan! I will admit that I was disappointed with Dozer. They really show no originality, but this album is worth it soley for Unida. Gotta love Delta Alba Plex (smokin')"
2,Free swap shop kind,"2 1/2While shedding some of the dead weight lower-tiered neo-progressive carries around, these middling melodics still taper off into apathetic technicalities."
1,"Bad design, break easily","I am an Art teacher that has been using Fiskars student scissors for 10+ years. When I received my latest order of scissors, they were of this new type with the ""larger"" handles (exactly like these, but without the ""softgrip""). Because of the new way that the blades are seated into the handles, they are prone to become loose and wobbly, eventually rendering them impossible to cut with. This is at the plastic connection point, not the pivot screw, so they cannot be re-tightened. I have 10 year old pairs of the other style that cut better than these new ones. Furthermore, the new, ""larger"" handles actually have smaller finger openings-- so they are uncomfortable for larger-handed students to use or for adults to demonstrate with."
5,Kid Friendly,"When my niece and nephew come over, they like to do crafts and these scissors work great for them. They fit their fingers perfectly and the blades are blunt which prevent them from accidentally cutting themselves. They also like the fun colors and I like the fact that they are easy to wipe down after use."
4,Safety Scissors,Scissors work great. My five year old daughter love the fun colors. Good Grip for slippery little hands. I would recommend.
1,Beware of fuzzy dancers!,"Great ballet performances on Blu-ray are a joy to behold, not least because of the stunning HD image, but this one must have been incorrectly mastered as it goes horribly fuzzy as soon as the dancers move. Standing still, they are crystal clear. I own a dozen Blu-rays of ballets, including several produced by Opus Arte, and they all look magnificent and sharp - even in extremely fast movement. I previously bought the DVD of this title, but returned it to the shop as defective. So imagine my disappointment when I saw that the Blu-ray was just as blurry. Hopefully, Opus Arte will correct this when a new pressing is due, but that might take years, I'm afraid. I advise potential customers to stay away from ""Jewels"". Watching this ""smear"" gave me a headache and was painful to the eyes. What a pity, as this a a gorgeous balett."
3,frosty perfection,"The Paris Opera Ballet is a great company, but there is something missing from their performance of Balanchine's ballet. They perform ""Emeralds"" and ""Diamonds"" with frosty perfection; only ""Rubies"" comes to life."
1,This book is outdated!,"We just returned from a trip to New York City. I am a HUGE fan of Access books and have used them for cities around the world for the last 14 years. However, the current version of the New York City Access is woefully outdated and was a waste of money. We found several businesses had moved and one, the venerable Balducci's, had gone of out business. Needless to say, this de-railed us a few times and was inconvenient to say the least.Things change quickly in New York. If Access wants to be in the business of publishing guides of New York, they need to commit to annual updates."
2,2008 Edition is Outdated,"We were in New York July 2010. Access guidebooks are my favorite, however the 2008 edition for New York City is outdated. I gave the 2 star rating because the current edition is outdated. We were disappointed more than once to find our destination out of business. Be sure to call ahead to verify any place you want to visit, especially in SoHo and the Village, if you are using the 2008 edition. Wish I had just used my old one and not purchased the ""new"" one. If you have never used an Access Guidebook, you definitely need to be introduced to them. Current editions are invaluable. Organization and information are both wonderful."
1,I got my money back!,"Thank goodness the store where I bought this book had a money-back guarantee if you didn't enjoy it, because I HATED this one! I would give it zero stars if I could. Does KS really think she can pass these off as the same two people from ""Devotion""? Because I don't recognize either one of them now. The two strong people who fought for what they wanted (each other) in the previous novel are nowhere to be found here. Trey is the worst - where is his spirit and backbone? And he and Maria don't get so much as a tender kiss in the whole novel. I gave ""Devotion"" 3 stars because it ended so abruptly, but looking back I wish KS had left us hanging forever with that one. This wrap-up is a disaster and I will try to forget I ever read it. If you liked ""Devotion"" at all please don't ruin your memory of it with this garbage."
1,This was not a romance.,"This was my first book by this author, and it will be my last. When the book first started, I was a little surprised to see that it was told in the first person from the hero's point of view, and that snagged my interest. I spent the rest of the book simply becoming more and more angry at the weakness of the hero and the fact that he allowed his lover to continue to live in his house and share his bed (you read that correctly) while his supposed love of his life was down the hall, having been rescued from an insane asylum. He was no hero. The only character with personality was the lover, Edwina, and she was manipulative and self serving. Trey and Maria end up together at the end, and it is by some miracle apparently, because they certainly never had a real conversation. This book had real potential, but was obviously poorly planned and written to make a buck. Don't waste your money."
4,very pleased,"I gave this as a gift and the recipiant who is a gormet cook and uses a lot of Balsamic vinegar, really liked it. Product arrived promptly when I ordered it."
4,Nice alternative to the OEM floor mat,Delivered as stated - good.Fits in the floor pretty good after a little trimming - good. Not perfect but does the job.The fasten down is just a hole. I needed to cut an oval shaped hole to be able to use the lock down device VW provided for the floor mat.Instead of vacuuming the mat - just pull it out and wash it down.Overall - satisfied with the product.
5,Pro treason republicans beware,An awesome album that points out how pathetic the bush huggers are in their feeble attempt to justify TREASON AND TORTURE AND LIES. It must be embarrassing to admit to being a conservative these days. No wonder that even the fox news poll puts bush's approval rating at 36% and 6 out of 10 americans think he is a liar.But the best is how franken has shown O'reilly to be such a liar himself. Who would buy his crap? Probably other treason supporting friends of bin laden bush huggers.
5,Al Franken for President!,"This is a hilarious cd. Franken brings his humor direct from his radio show and highlights his best moments in this cd. Not only is this man a genius in comedy, but a genius in politics and delivering a message that we simply do not hear from the other side. What an excellent value for the money and a wonderful way to support the Dems! Thank goodness he is on the best South Florida radio station (AM 940) and I get to listen to him daily![...]"
1,What a Bummer!!!,"I really have liked his other work. I'm a great fan of Al Franken, but this was a HUGE disappointment. Would not recommend to anyone. What a waste of $15.00."
1,Where's the humor?,"I love most everything Al has done, but I don't see ANY humor in most of these snippets. The Bill O'Reilly war story had a few clever bits, but the rest of the tracks are flatter than pith on a platter. Very disappointing."
1,HE IS JUST LIKE O'REILLY..A PRODUCT HAWKER,"Most radio shows will just play best of for free( btw Howard Stern invented the "" BEST OF SHOW "" ) ..to think he is selling it is very Bill O'Rielly. Sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck...vomit , puke"
1,"Geesh, do you think he's a democrat?","Way too easy to snipe and bicker instead of really trying to tackle the issues. At least O'Reilly makes an effort to think of a solution and is not afraid to criticize the Republican's when they deserve it. Where is the Clinton-Monica sketch? Would be way funnier. I found only about a laugh every other sketch, very weak in my opinion."
3,Well written but exhausting,"Zindell writes beautifully and his universe is incredibly well-realized, but every bit of action or description in this book is larded with philosophical speculation. It gets tiring."
3,An introduction to fishing the Park,"This book provides a basic introduction to fly fishing in Rocky Mountain National Park, but left me wanting for a lot more. The focus is on lake fishing, with little emphasis on the beautiful little streams throughout the park. The information on hatches and flies is sparse, something I'd expect a lot of information about from a book targeted at such a specific area. There's a lot devoted to casting, knot tying and general fly fishing technique that I found of little use, but that's not uncommon in this type of book. All in all, if you'd like to get started in RMNP, this is a decent way to go, but realize going in that there is a lot missing here."
2,"Big on fishing with little advice about RMNP ""hot spots""","I was suprised that soooo much of this books was about knots, rods, presentation etc and not about Rocky Mountain National Park waters. This book is more of a ""how to flyfish disertation"" rather than a book that will guide you to the park's hidden treasures. It was better than nothing but a bit thin on destinations."
2,Light on content for RMNP,"Most of this book is instruction on how to fly fish. The section on RMNP maps the lakes and rivers without the detail on parking, access , etc. that other book may contain."
5,My twins love this book!,I have 18 month twins who learned their letters in about two weeks from the Meet the Letters DVD. I bought them the lift the flap book and they fought over it so much that I had to get them each one. They read the books while they are watching the video and love to lift the flaps as each as each letter appears on the screen. I also love the construction of these books. Every other lift-the-flap book in my house has all of the flaps torn off. This book is very sturdy and the flaps aren't the kind that you can tear off. This is the only kind of lift-the-flap book that can withstand the abuse of my twins! They haven't torn a single flap. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to teach letters to their young children and especially to any kids who love the video as much as mine.
4,"6 Speed PT Cruiser 26"" Bike",Overall a great bike for the Money. The only problem I have with the whole thing was the condition of the bike when shipped. The Bike was some what grungy (an oily film) when I took it out of the box. This was easily cleaned off though. The only MAJOR problem I am trying to resolve is getting replacement fenders. Both fenders were in terrible condition with extensive damage. The bolts use for mounting the fenders also did not fit the application. The fenders appear to be white in the photo and are actually made out of a real flimsy chromed tin. I am basiclly riding the bike without the fenders no real big deal. I am a large guy over 300lbs and bought this bike to get my butt off the couch. This bike is excellent if your a big person. The seat is great the balloon tires hold the weight and ride out smooth. The brakes and gear shifter work great. Like I said it's a great bike for the $$$ and all the neighborhood kids think it's cool!
3,Great toy but I wish they wouldn't slide around as much,"We bought the Children's Factory CF321-620 Big Blocks, Set A and B for our kids and thought they would have a blast with it. Reality was, that they didn't play with them much because the blocks kept sliding around so much that they kids were either falling off or sliding in between the blocks.Quality was great, but it would be neat if the manufacturer had added some velcro to it so the blocks would stick to each other a little. That way they kids could built, play, climb and jump without falling in between the blocks or knocking everything over.Returned the items for a refund."
5,Love this product,"I started using this product about four months ago and it has done wonders for my skin. I had a lot of sun damage from years in the sun, redness, uneven skin tone and sunspots. My skin tone is more even, the redness is gone and my skin is more luminous, and fine lines are diminished. Sunspots are gone with the aid of sunspot es also found on amazon (use together). In short I look decades younger for pennies,"
3,miffy dvd,"Older son loved Miffy, wanted younger one to be able to enjoy it too. Language is clear and simple storylines. Dvd is easy play with good episodes. Only disadvantage is that theme song does not play at start of each episode, and we loved the song."
3,Decent work from Alan Moore,"While this certainly isn't the greatest story to ever appear in Britain's 2000AD magazine, writer Alan Moore and artist Jim Baikie do a serviceable job, telling the tale of a peaceful alien crash landing on Earth, and the not-so-peaceful government authorities who want him at any cost. Luckily, our hero ""Skizz"" has a group of sympathetic Earthlings who just want to help him return home. If this sounds familiar, well, it's basically ""ET"" set in Birmingham, England, with a bit more serious and practical tone. This is very generic work from Moore, and it shows in comparison to his later masterpieces. Still, SKIZZ is an engaging tale, with excellent characterization, and some genuinely funny moments."
4,A Marvelous Representation of a Timeless Love Song,"Eres Tu, it is you is superbly represented with outstanding vocals that identify the tenderness, sweetness and purity of this timeless Spanish love song. I have used this song at my daughters sweet 16 and as I knew it would it brought tears of joy and happiness to all my guests. The orchestra was outstanding highlighting the emotions and vocals it accompanied. Hurrah! Hurrah!"
3,use only for class,It is an interesting book. I am a music student at university and I would recommend this book only if you need it for a class. It is a dry read.
2,Not Enough of Tommy (Too Much Orchestration),"I truly admire the guitar skills of Tommy but they are well hidden on this two CD set. Buy the CD named ""The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World"" to really hear Tommy (and Chet Atkins) play guitars. I wish there were a way to return CDs that you don't like... next time I'll take the time to sample the tracks!"
1,The Brutal Truth,"If you're a stoner, you may enjoy this week-end cabin flopping, never-ending drone of apparently a half-dozen out-of-work actors who clearly had nothing else better to do but to transcript one of their pot-head boring parties. It was one of those few misconceived independent film attempts that is amateurish on every level, and I couldn't fast-forward through it fast enough. All the while I was watching it, I was hoping Christina Applegate (Married with Children fame) would come in and save this story. But she only shows in a disappointing series of short flashbacks, except for her terrorized cameo roll toward the end that she performed near perfection. In a short while, you quickly hope this film transforms into another teen hatchet picture---if only to halt the harangues. But these resilient characters just keep on breathing."
1,The Brutal Truth,"This pretentious and uneven movie tries to be a twenty-something Big Chill and fails miserably. What Christina Applegate (who is in the film for all of five minutes) is doing in such a horrible movie, I have no idea. The film centers around a group of old friends, none of whom are even remotely interesting, and has a ""message"" about not running from your past that's about as insultingly simplistic and empty-headed as the rest of the script. In addition, it uses something as hideous as sexual assault in a cavalier and ""oh by the way, this is what happened"" manner that brings new depth to the term ""gratuitous"". How and or why this movie was made is beyond me. Awful, not even worth renting."
1,THE LITTLE CHILL,"The film is divided into two parts. In the first part Emily has a great relationship with a swing. A group of friends have a reunion at a country home which Emily invites them to. Then Emily has a bad relationship with a swing and the group becomes isolated due to the earthquake that happened at the same time. They examine their lives and ignore the gorilla in the living room, i.e. the reason why Emily had a bad relationship with the rope of the swing.The dialouge bored me as did the soundtrack and the lame narration at the beginning of the film. If anything, it was funny to watch good actors struggle with a lousy role and lines. Worthy of a pass. The flashback scene was stupid. They could have done a far better job.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity (Jennifer Daly?), off screen rape."
2,"I wish it were good, but it just wasn't","I like Christina Applegate and Molly Ringwald, which is why it is hard to believe this movie was so bad. And not in any kind of cultish or campy way. It was just bad like it wasn't done from a script, just from jumbled notes, with pages missing. Characters seem to explode or make speeches at random, and you feel like missing scenes and lots of characterization that should have preceded these episodes might have explained them and made them relavent/believable."
4,Really NOT as bad as you all say,"I watched this movie last night after borrowing it, and was pleasantly surprised it had me laughing & crying. I rather enjoyed it, I really liked Molly Ringwald's icy, chain-smoking character. Yeah, I agree, a few too many ""flashbacks"", and a little slow, but you all act like you've never actually SEEN a BAD movie before. Truly BAD movies you don't even finish watching, no matter your liking for an actor or not. I've seen countless BAD movies, and sorry folks, but this ain't one of 'em. Give it a little credit. It's NOT that bad. No, not even close to award-worthy, but not as bad as you all're saying. Yes, the rape scenes were a bit brutal, but I've seen 1000 times worse in VERY good films. The Brutal Truth was a good film I'd watch again - I very much enjoyed watching it last night. I liked the story & found it a little original - it had a lot more potential than the film showed, but still worth watching.Sincerely,Chandraaka JaidaMoon"
4,Beauty of Ireland,"Excellent video. It brought back wonderful memories of my past trip to Ireland. It also gave me new ideas for my next trip. The video has a wonderful blend of lanscape, culture, and history. Unfortunately the video only covers four counties (Donegal, Dublin, Cork, and Kerry), but it covers them very well."
5,The Most Coveted Scissors,"Ain't that the truth? Your best friend will step over your dead body to have these scissors. They are so sharp and perfect for either lefties (like me) or righties (I'm guessing). Last time I had mine, they were all gunked up with tape, but even that did not slow down these super-sharp blades. They cut through anything: paper, hair, high-quality denim, several layers of tape, I've even cut through a staple with them."
2,"Thank You Very Much, But That's More Than I Wanted To Know.","Jammed with excruciating details, Professor Horsley has expanded what might have been an enthralling monograph into a boring book. The text is appropriate for New Testament scholars, Biblical archeologists, and serious students of nascent rabbinical Judaism. However, for those of us, who are merely ordinary mortals, the text is simply burdened with too much repetitive minutiae."
4,Mysterious and wonderfully strange tonality,I loved this collection of very early vintage recordings. If you care about clear fidelity it's not for you but for any musician or lover of world music this is an exciting disc. I love the extremely unique tonality and find it inspiring my own music in new directions.
1,Crap -- Unless You've Got a Drill and a Spare Bolt,"They broke the first time they were used. See the uploaded photos for the story. You'll need a drill, bolt, two nuts and a washer to properly fix these!"
2,"It is Graphic, it does tease but overall does not deliver.","The actresses, Misty Bottoms and Hanna Painalingus, have had better movies in their younger years. Misty is really sagging nowadays and Hanna has wrinkles in places that I didn't think could get wrinkles(could be from overuse). However because of their fatigue (and possibly mental disabilities from their legandary drug use) one scene is paticularly funny. Hanna, after performing an energetic love scene, collapses into a beach hammock. Appearantly this was a hastily thrown together prop and....hi Well just watch to see what happens"
