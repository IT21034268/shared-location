3,OK Movie,"It's an OK movie and shows these two guys are getting older, just like the rest of us. But, it has its moments...entertaining, and not too bad family movie."
4,Old Dogs,"Very funny, thought it would just be a copy of the other like movies out there. Entire family laughed, very entertaining."
2,This film is an old dog,"Some people like to see the same formula over and over. That is how we get series and sequences. However, this story is older than the hills. Someone with no parenting skills must choose between a career and the new family. Of course there are also the babysit for a week formulas that rival this old story.Well now we know the story and how worn out it is. What is left? Maybe the actors? Well it was not that bad. However, none of the actors with the exception of Rita Wilson who carried her part well even came up to their potential. O.K at least the scenes at the Zoo kick up the film a notch. However, sight gags does not a story make unless you are Charlie Chaplin.I only Saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare versions. The voice over commentary helps a bit when you see what was trying to be accomplished.In any event, you have probably seen this story before and in a much better presentation."
1,Old Dogs review,"It's that same story we heard a million times before. A workaholic dad ignores his family but then by the 3rd art,he realizes that family is more important. Did I mention that he has to break off a million dollar deal to do that? It's tried,cliche and predictable. At least, in his other movie,RV:there were some good jokes and characters but NOT HERE! I give this film a 0 out of 10."
1,Old Hacks:,"The more appropriate title. This poor movie you can smell a mile away. Robin Williams in a movie equals YAWN and ""insult to injury"". These days, J. Travolta is falling into the same category. Actually the only good movie he's been in is Pulp Fiction, thanks to the pandering nature of Q.Tarentino. It was his best role, after Barbarino."
2,Not a good Dog to Watch,"This movie has 2 of the most talented Men ever.How could they make a film like this?Travolta kept bragging how talented his daughter was in the movie,and she hardly speaks a word,and the scenes move so fast your head is spinning.There are so many great films staring John Travolta and Robin Williams.This is not one of them."
2,Another step backwards for Robin Williams,"Another year and another ho-hum comedy from Robin Williams. This time he is paired with John Travolta. Together they play best friends from school who run a business together out of New York City. Life is going normally when William's character discovers he had two children from a one-night stand over a decade ago. The movie then becomes a family comedy about one man's evolution from single man to father. There are some funny scenes, such as when the kids mix up the prescription pills of their father. But there are some really stupid scenes also, such as the one featuring the gorilla shown on the DVD case. The characters themselves are believable, but much of the story is somewhat ludicrous. A good example is how the main characters seal a business deal with a Japanese company with unintended actions. Overall, a below-average comedy for 2009. And Robin Williams looks totally scripted, with none of his former gusto and provocative humor."
2,For kids only,"I wanted to see this movie because the cast seemed impressive enough. Robin Williams, John Travolta, Kelly Preston, etc.After 15 agonizing minutes the wife and I couldn't take it anymore.I think if we had kids who were pre-teen this might be entertainig for them but at our age (ahem, 50+) it was dull and boring. The Robin Williams character didn't seem real or original, maybe because I'm used to seeing him in more of a slapstick role. John Travolta? Give me Vincent Vega any day. (re:Pulp Fiction)"
1,A crime against humanity,"A exercise in comedy futility, and a waste of two good hours that I could have spent staring at a wall, which incidentally would be more entertaining. It could have only gotten worse if tyler perry or ice cube had a cameo."
5,Smart Dogs,I wasn't too sure how well Travolta and Williams would work together but after watching this they were hilarious. Some brand new gags I hadn't even heard of and the gorilla sequence made me roll on the floor! Would love to see them together again.
3,Nonsensical - but with some very funny moments,"I won't give the overview as others have done this - I'll dive right in. This movie had some really hilarious moments, but in between it dragged on and was full of very unbelievable, overdone scenes. I really appreciate that Travolta and Williams chose a family friendly film, and it even had a fine message about love, sacrafice and putting family and friends ahead of everything else. Both of these actors are charismatic and pleasant to watch.Regardless the movie was slow, and we were tempted to turn it off. Just when we would get ready to jump ship, something very funny would happen, so we kept watching. Then the cycle would repeat itself. There were also many bits that were just cliche and silly.The best part of the DVD was the DVD extra - a music video with Travolta and his daughter."
3,Old Dogs,Pretty good. Some very funny parts. Both my sons and I enjoyed it and we really laughed at a few of the problems they get into.
4,john travolta comedy,"Although I am not a fan of John Travolta doing comedy, but paring him with Robin Williams was a wonderful choice. My family and I laughed till we cried. Its worth the money and very very funny."
1,The Jokes Were Forced And Unnatural!,"I am not sure why, but I didn't laugh or smile once while watching this movie. This movie was so dull and silly and the jokes seemed to be forced on us. I think Travolta should stick to serious roles and Robin Williams should choose the script better next time. I couldn't watch more than 45 minutes of this movie and had to stop it immediately afterwards.I totally regret renting this movie."
4,OLD STYLE COMEDY FUN,"This is a movie with the feel of an old fashion Disney movie, but designed for the modern expanded definition of family. Seven years ago Robin Williams got divorced. His buddy, John Travolta takes him to South Beach where Williams meets a girl, gets drunk, gets married, then has it annulled. However Williams still has feelings for his one night wife and after 7 years writes her a letter.They meet and he finds out he is the father of her two children. Through a series of circumstances, Williams agrees to watch his estranged kids for 2 weeks. Travolta aids Williams as they attempt to play dad with disastrous results. The jokes are a bit trite and much of the humor is slap stick. Most adults will find something to enjoy in the film while they watch it with their kids. The theme of the movie is that friends, love, and family are the most important things in life and together we can work through anything."
2,What a strange movie,"Two great actors... what went wrong?Except for the part when their pills are all mixed up and they have some very funny side-effects, the movie is just plain boring.Nothing is really defined... so you just don't feel it. You don't get to really care about the relationship between the guys, the feelings Dan has for this woman he met, the feelings he has about his kids... everything is just kind of superficial and every separate story has no depth to it.Disappointing. We expected something better."
5,An unexpected gem,"John Travolta and Robin Williams weren't a duo I had ever expected to see together in a movie. I was skeptical when I went to see this movie. What were they going to do that hadn't already been done? Well this movie has humor that appeals to those of us who hate to admit we can't quite do what we used to in our teens and 20's and humor for the kids... quite a bit of physical humor-which Robin Williams excels at and several cameo appearances, too. The very of Robin Williams be a straight man is funny to me. Give this movie a try... you will enjoy it."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this flim since I almost always love films with Robin Williams and John Travolta, but I couldn't wait for thjis one to be over. I was both bored and irritated. This is a film for kids onl,y unlike some films made for children that adults also enjoy watching."
3,Watch for language,Very diappointed in the language. Had dampended my desire to finish watching it. Definitely not for younger viewers. I am not sure it is appropriate for any viewer
1,Terrible!,"This movie is not even funny in any sense of the word.I am a fan of Robin Williams,but I was completly letdown by ""Old Dogs"".This has to be his worst movie ever.If you're looking for a great Robin Williams comedy...then go for a different movie.Such as ""Mrs.Doubtfire"" and leave this crap alone."
1,Outa there after ten minutes,Ten minutes were all we could take of this movie. It featured charactes about whom we had no reason to care. They talked a lot. We fidgeted.
2,One of Disney's worst live action films!,"I heard that Disney films would no longer show people smoking cigarettes in any of their films. I guess, they don't have a problem with scenes that involve showing a 7 yr old go number 2 on the toilet or Seth Green getting nailed in the nuts with a golf ball.I also find it funny that they have a problem with smoking, yet no problem with Travolta and Williams drinking huge margaritas and getting smashed in a family film. The movie just feels like a movie that was originally meant for adults but toned down to be a family film.John Travolta and Robin Williams have made bad movies in the past, but Old Dogs makes Wild Hogs and Father's Day look good. I didn't laugh that much at all and talented people like Seth Green, Matt Dillion, Justin Long and the late Bernie Mac are all wasted in supporting roles."
1,Retread at Best - Stolen Ideas at Worst,Nothing creative;nothing new;all retreaded;totally used.To borrow ideas;is one thing;to steal ideas;is everything.
3,Old Dogs,"Not thrilled. Besides not being as funny as I'd imagined, the movie was terrible quality. It skipped throughout the entire movie."
1,"Good cast, it tries hard, but.....","Well, we were 0-2 for movies this weekend. We got The Princess and The Frog which stunk, so we put in Old Dogs. With this cast, we thought - good, a funny movie. Well, it tries real hard. However, it just doesn't pack the humor that it attempts to deliver. We turned it off about 45 minutes into the movie and returned it to Red Box."
1,Williams can do better,"This movie is not a good reflection on Robin Williams's comedy. In my opinion ""Mrs.Doutfire"" was 10 times better then this. As for John Travolta, I've never really considered him to be that funny.Whenever I watch a movie with Robin Williams in it, I usually have high expectations, lets just say these expectations were let down when the credits rolled.Overall, other then a few funny parts ""Old Dogs"" is a boring movie."
4,A fine addition for any STL/C++ programmer,"The boost graph library extends the STL tool box of containers into graph containers. Wished for a general purpose graph? This is the place. Never studied graph's in a CS course, but know basic data structures like lists, hashes and trees? This is a fine place to start. The book goes from basic, what is a graph good for, (solving search, and routing problems) to what are the various drawbacks to the different approaches.If you are used to using the C++ STL library you will feel right at home using this. (BTW this library works with MSVC 6.5)"
1,ABSOLUTE BIZARRE SUCKAGE,"THIS BOOK MAKES CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE NOW NONEXISTENT CD-ROM CONTENT. THE PUBLISHERS AND/OR AUTHOR HAVE REMOVED THE CD-ROM FROM THE BOOK'S PRINTING AND NOW DELIVER THE CD-ROM CONTENT OVER THIS PUBLISHERS HORRENDOUSLY CRAPPY INTERNET WEBSITE. THE CD-ROM CONTENT IS NOW MADE AVAILABLE VIA ... WAIT FOR IT: STUFFIT *.SIT FILE. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP. THIS IS SO TOTALLY A BAIT AND SWITCH IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. TOTAL SUCKAGE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. BOOST! BOOST GRAPH! C/C++ RIGHT? RIGHT? NOT OBJECTIVE-C, NOT APPLE-SCRIPT. C/C++. TAR.GZ OR ZIP/GZIP OR PERHAPS TAR.BZIP2 IN A PINCH. STUFFIT? AYFKM AYFKM AYFKM? IF I COULD RETURN THE BOOK I TOTALLY WOULD ... BUT AMAZON DID NOT DELIVER THE BOOK WITH A PURCHASE ORDER AND/OR RETURN LABEL. AACK!"
2,The quality is not as good as I expected,The quality is not as good as I expected. I have the entire loony tunes collection and many of these less expensive alternatives the sound was out of sync for a few of these cartoons. I recomend the Classic Cartoons (asin B00063QD6G) instead it is a full two hours and the quality is much better (and it is less money). Or buy the looney toons Golden Collection (it is more money this one) but the quality is good.
4,Doris Day's Sentimental Journey/Latin for Lovers,"Doris Day has a beautiful voice. I picked this album for the Latin for Lovers songs, mostly. Her versions of these aren't heard as much as the ones on the first half of the CD, though both parts are very good. Doris at her singing best."
2,Sentimental Journey/Latin for Lovers by Doris Day,"I was dissappointed in this collection of songs by Doris Day as the music and singing went far too slowly; there were no songs with any rhythm or beat. I love Doris Day's voice and most of her albums, but this particular one just seemed to drag on and on."
4,Great background,"For anyone looking for information about the Woodstock Festival, this is a great place to start but keep in mind that there are many stories to be told"
4,Works great - maybe I should have got a longer one?,"I use this to connect my Fender Strat directly to my iMac (2008 model), and use with Garageband. It works perfectly. I get all the amps and pedal effects built in to Garageband - the only hardware I own is the Mac and the guitar!It's not as 'beefy' a cable as what a musician would expect, but it fits right and does the job. I might prefer a much longer one so I can play guitar farther away from the computer, and not worrying about yanking the cable...but it's easy to extend."
3,"Cheap cable, but works","Not the best sound quality, but does work and has been working for about 2 years now. Would recommend this product to friends but if looking for best quality, going to need to pay more."
1,Not Stereo,Not a good purchase. Was advertised as stereo and is mono. Too little of a thing to send back. Not happy though.
3,Prayer Suggestions,"I personally thought that this book was decent, and a good reference piece, but, in all honesty, I do not like the poems all that well. For me, they lack feeling and emotion. The poems feel empty and hollow. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because, as stated before, it is a decent source of prayer information, and great for suggestions for making your own prayers, but I think that the best prayers come from within. Take the suggestions, and make your own, you'll get a lot more for it."
3,So so,"As someone who really enjoys a great book with useful prayers and stories, I found this book to be so-so. I really liked the first part of the book where the author explains how and why he wrote the prayers he wrote. But despite there being hundreds of prayers in this book, I've found most of them to be flat and sterile. They are very short prayers, more like poetry than an actual prayer. The language used is very unusual, and just seems to fall flat. I was really hoping for a book that engaged me in prayers that used everyday language to connect on an emotional and spiritual level with the God/Goddess. I would say one out of every 20-30 prayers in this book barely manages to do that for me."
5,Very User Friendly,"This is a wonderful book for any Pagan to own. The prayers found in this book are very usable, practical, and easy to modify. Serith put a lot of thought and study into prayer, how and why we use/need it, as well as how to write prayers of your own."
4,Why we need Pagan Prayers ?,"This is a good book on pagan blessings and prayers.But,not a great book on the topic.There are some other books on pagan prayers,but not many.Maybe someday soon ,a more solid pagan hymnal will been published too.Why the need for pagan prayers?Recently,the media has printed articles about the loss of religion in America.So,does that mean America is becoming an atheistic nation? Atheism is nihilism.People need to believe in something divine.Atheism will destroy society.Atheists will only decay society and disregard the environment of the good Earth.This book is a good starting point for getting people to be spiritual about the cycles of the Earth.The pagan evocations are good,yet could be more eloquently florescent in dictation.A floruit time of pagan prayers is ready to bloom,and we will see more writings offered soon."
5,Why Miles was cool!,"Not that Miles Davis needs further affirmation, but I just transferred this soundtrack from its original LP format onto an audiocassette. And it still sounds fantastic after all these years! Neophytes, who may have been recently introduced to Davis' music through movies like THE TERMINAL and COLLATERAL, would find it worthwhile to work backwards and listen to this album. It is great, though often overshadowed by BITCHES BREW."
5,One Heavy MFing Fusion Jam Session,"It started as an imprompto jam waiting for Miles and pueblo they hit a groove. Rock, blues, punk, ambient, jazzes ... its all there. Nothing before or after like it. The concept of a Big MFer like Jack Johnson bounding around the ring and punching the [heck] out of his opponents really drives the music at first but then you are blind-sided when it suddenly spaces out with a beautiful Silent Way passage that puts you in another, completely different, incredible groove. Then the fusion jam re-emerges to punch you out again!Miles very sweet and bold. Sonny Sharrock rocks! Herbie mines funk from the organ. Cobham kicks!I never tire of listening to this. Like On The Corner it always amazes and you learn something new after listening to ""new"" music, eg rap, avant guarde classical."
5,If my house was on fire,"If I came home from work and found my living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. on fire I would first save my dog then grab A Tribute to Jack Johnson. I recommend buying this album soon if you don't have it!"
5,Wonderful book with great variety of recipes,"This book has lots of recipes for clay cookers as well as many tips about cooking in clay. Many cookers don't come with an abundance of information or recipes, so this book fills two large gaps. There is great variety in recipes, many of which are fairly simple, and this variety is also helpful in adapting your favorite recipes to clay cooking. The book is reasonably priced, which is a wonderful bonus. If you cook in clay or want to cook in clay, this is the book for you"
2,Only if you cook using cans of soup,"This is a vastly overrated book. The recipes are pedestrian at best, in lineal descent from Betty Crocker. The author apparently thinks of food as 'food products.' Touted as including microwave cooking in clay, it does not, just offers a page of advice. If you like to cook, buy a different book."
4,Cooking in Clay (Nitty Gritty Cookbooks),Purchased the book to go with a Clay Roaster gift . Reviewed the book and liked it. Hope the recipient also enjoys it.
1,gift for Dad,"My Dad is still waiting for this cookbook which should have arrived long before Fathers' Day. Wish I knew it would take so long to fill this order when I placed it. IF and WHEN he gets it, I'm sure he'll enjoy using it with his new clay roaster (that did arrive on time)."
4,A giant with feet of clay,"The best senator in Congress... and Clymer explains exactly why it is so. A flawed man, who by hard work and diligence, becomes an excellent representative and spokesman for the highest ideals of the republic. An outstanding biography, a story you need to know."
3,Still waiting for the definitive biography,"Kennedy has been acknowledged by both liberals and conservatives as being a master legislator in areas such as civil rights,anti-poverty legislation,healthcare and even trucking and airline deregulation. This book tries to be a policy biography but it lacks the detail that a good policy biography has. Plus it explains Kennedy's roles in these legislative fights but does not see how he fit into the wider process of policymaking. That is ""Kennedy does x"" but how did that help or hinder a piece of legislation to be passed is something Clymer does not examine,and in a policy biography this is necessary. Plus the biography seems to be very unfocused,jumping from topic to topic without going into great detail about any one period in Kennedy's life. I have to say that the definitive biography of Kennedy's legislative career has yet to be written."
4,History all around,"The author had incredible access, not only to Sen. Kennedy, but to his friends and family. His political career is amazing that is largely overshawdowed by his brothers. The book takes us through the last forty years of American and World History and reminds us how Kennedy has been there through it all. Clymer spends too much time with the detail of Senate work, but overall, it is a compelling read."
3,Teddy Kennedy a life,"Like all of us Teddy's life has been good and bad. I have not gone through deaths of his brothers in such a tragic way. I especially loved Robert. His long tenure in the senate is historic even though I have disagreed with a lot of his beliefs. He also lost 2 sisters tragically. and all of his children have been affected by cancer. His first marriage ended in divorce and alcohol has been a factor of many events. The event in July of 1969 influenced national and personal politics. Overall, he has been blessed with both good fortune and tragedy unspeakable. This book explores them all. And that he has been responsable for 16 children. And now he is in the fight to save his own life. Life has dealt him some really sad things and this book like life is worth your reading."
3,Passion is not ordinary in the Regis & Kathy Lee audience,"PASSION IS NO ORDINARY WORD offers a pretty good sampling of Graham Parker's career through 1991. Except for the strange omissions of ""A Brand New Book"" and ""Protection,"" the anthology includes all the Parker classics this long-time fan expected. Otherwise, as what seems to be the norm for these anthologies, the PASSION IS NO ORDINARY WORD selections favor the artist's older music. The souvenier booklet adds value. To promote PASSION IS NO ORDINARY WORD, Graham Parker appeared on the ""Live With Regis and Kathy Lee,"" TV show. Kathy Lee Gifford did a fine interview with Parker, but when he sang a reggae, acoustic-guitar version of ""Get Started, Start A Fire,"" Graham dumbfounded the white-bread studio audience. (Good thing the applause sign worked.) Just for that, pick up PASSION IS NO ORDINARY WORD."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"It works but the 1/8 inch end doesn't fit snug into any input. Constantly falling out. The price is right but if you aren't going to be setting it and forgetting it with this thing, shell out a few more bucks."
3,Perfectly good for the price,"This HOSA cable is exactly what I needed: to allow me to listen to my i-pod touch through a medium quality A/V receiver and speakers. The sound quality ""does not appear to be"" nowhere near my other system consisting of a much higher quality A/V receiver and speakers. Of course the reason is the difference in the components, including the HOSA cable. To make the comparison even more difficult, the two surround sound systems are at different locations. So, I can't make an A-B comparison. I am satisfied with this purchase as it cost me 15% of the Monster Cable I use in the other system. I plan to install the HOSA cable in my better set-up to make a valid A-B comparison and establish once-and-for-all whether money I spent on the expensive cable was worth it. So, the 3* rating I gave above is subject to the qualifications described here."
3,Can't say much,"These are not top of the line nor are they junk, mid grade and do what they are supposed to"
5,iPod,I connect the iPod to the home stereo system. Why buy a dock when I have a coupld hundred dollar sound system right there?
3,Good service.Good product.,Good service.Good product quality-works much better than the cheap Chinese metric cables that others sell.(padding words to make up minimum)
5,My son loves it!,We were given this video for christmas and we have worn the tape out. It is by far my son's favorite video. It is fun and educational. He goes around most of the day singing the I dig dirt theme song. This video is great if you have little boys who like dirt and tractors.
4,Favorite DVD Video,Our 2 year old grandson loves diggers and this video is watched over and over. He often sings the Digger song throughout the day. For the adults in the family watching this video over and over at 6:30 in the morning can be a little much. But it gives early morning quiet time. This video is a must for any child who loves diggers. It is a much requested DVD.
1,Avoid like the plague,"makes horrible noise when inserted in tape player. Commands don't work on my ipod 5G. wasted $30, and would never buy anything else from Griffin."
1,Just doesn't work,"Should have believed all the other negative reviews. Didn't work in my Honda Civic and didn't work in my Nissan Altima, both with original manufacturer tape decks. In both cases, the tape deck whirred for a bit, then ejected the SmartDeck."
1,"Don't waste your time or money, this is a piece of junk!!","I received this as a Christmas gift and had to wait almost a month to receive it. Well, it was definitely not worth the wait. I tried it in my 2001 Saab and it worked great (for about 30 minutes). The sound quality was actually quite good when it played. Every time thereafter, I could always count on it working for no more than 3-4 minutes before it would spit the cassette back out for no reason at all. I would put it back in and it would eject within a minute or two. At least it might work in my wife's car (2000 Volvo), right? Wrong!!! It did the same thing in her car as well. I am returning to the manufacturer immediately."
1,Keep your receipt!,"I don't have much to say that hasn't been said already regarding this accessory for your iPod. Just wanted to confirm that its lovely disclaimer about not working in all cars is true so keep your receipt - you will most likely end up returning it. If you haven't yet bought it, find one that's more seasoned and doesn't have a very poor track record.I will say for the record the 3 songs it worked without skipping to the next song after 30 seconds, it sounded amazing for a cassette adapter.I think Griffin needs to create a 2nd or 3rd generation of this gadget. Hopefully the bugs will be gone by then."
1,"Wow, yet another negative review...","I bought this to use in my 2000 Nissan Maxima. After trying twenty times, I still could not get it to work. My cassette player simply wouldn't play it (kept clicking and clicking and clicking). So then I thought it could just be my own cassette player, so I tried it in my 2003 Toyota Highlander. Still the clicking. Then I tried it in my husband's 2006 Toyota Camry. Still doesn't work. Wow, so it doesn't work in cars with old casette players, nor in cars with BRAND NEW cassette players. Then I saw on the box in tiny print ""may not work with all cassette players"": well then which ones does it work with? They're 0 for 3! Please don't waste your time and buy this-- I can't believe that Griffin would come out with something like this that is so so low in quality. I am returning it ASAP."
4,Works for me,"Purchased the one with the dock connector for an '02 Chrysler T&C (minivan). Works fine, and the steering wheel controls work, too. Sound quality good (not CD, but better than FM), and the sound of the tape deck running is tolerable."
1,very poor customer service,"don't buy. when you get the product it doesn't work and the description was not clear on what specific models it would and would not work with. when i tried to call to have them sent back. no one answered, and after 1month when I went through amazon, the seller started sending me combative emails on how I didn't give them time to answer. how i wasn't going to give them a good review. they continued to argue with how i was an awful person cause i didn't like this product and how it was my fault the product didn't work. i should of investigated more if it would work with my ipod. i looked up company and they had over 70 complaints with the Better Business Buerual. don't deal with this specific company. they don't stand behind their product. I got so frustrated with trying to get them returned. I just threw both of them away, and forgot about the refund. not worth the hassle."
1,Poor Effort,"I guess I'm not alone, considering these reviews.This adapter is unmitigated garbage. Performs bad, sounds awful.The whole advantage of an MP3 player is that I can forward, skip, and pause with the controls on the device. This is more like a cassette emulator for the iPod, so you can get back all the winding, lag, and waiting you had with the real cassette deck controls.The whole arrangement of using the deck controls to run the iPod probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in practice it's a slow, kludgy gimmick.You can still use the iPod controls, but even then, the sound quality was notably bad, too. Thin and tinny."
2,doesn't work,"This device does not work for Iphones or ipod touch, but the advertsing and write up does not say this. To return, one must contact the purveyor, and their phone is always busy. A waste of $14.00"
1,"So, so, so, so BAD. Item discontinued on Griffin's website","When I popped the thing into my cassette player ('97 Chevy Monte Carlo), it refused to stay in! The player kept ejecting it, and after about (literally) 20 tries it finally stayed in and cracking noise others talked about was so bad. That doesn't really matter though, since when I plugged it into my ipod a message came up: ""device not compatible.""And then if you want to return it, you have to pay return shipping. Is it worth it since I paid so little for this piece of junk? Also, it wasn't until after all of this mess that I went on Griffin's website to see that the item has been DISCONTINUED. Hmm... I wonder why..."
1,Do Not Buy this product...,"This product is a good idea, but unfortunately, it does not work. You ipod will skip songs, fast forward or rewind unpredictably, or just stop for no reason.Read the other reviews and heed the warnings."
1,A Bonafide Piece of Crap!,"When I first tested the SmartDeck (using my iPod mini and stock cassette deck), it worked well because a song immediately began playing over my car speaker system. But that was the only thing that worked. I was unable to control my iPod using the buttons on my cassette deck (as advertised). When I pressed Fast-Forward (which is supposed to move to the next song) or Rewind (go back one song) the iPod did not respond. Sometimes, if I pressed the button really fast, it would move up a few songs, but that only worked 1 out of every 5 attempts. After fooling around with this piece of junk for an hour, I finally gave up. I also tested this on my friend's car and his cassette deck just spit out the SmartDeck every time. I would strongly recommend avoiding this product."
1,It Doesnt Work,I was waiting anxiously to receive this – and was sincerely hoping I wouldn’t have the issues that the others had written about. Unfortunately I did. The tape deck in my car (BMW 525i – 2001) did accept it – but it doesn’t actually play any music. I can see that the track is playing on the ipod – but there isn’t any sound from the car speakers. You have to press the ‘forward’ button twice on the tape deck to actually get the ipod to move a track forward – and even this isn’t reliable because it doesn’t work most times.Highly disappointing!!! It just surprises me that the adapter can actually pass on signals to the ipod – but cant get the sound to come through the car’s deck. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
5,Dissolves Quickly,"Green Magma has a much more pleasant taste then other green products I've tried, while still giving you similar nutrients. Like that it is made from barley-too."
2,Green Foods - Green Magma - OK but...,"When I had ordered this last year I'd received the original Dr. Hagiwara Green Magma made in Japan; the one in a glass jar. When it recently came time to re-order, I just went to my trusty Amazon account, found the old order, and re-ordered the same thing. However, what I received this time is the green magma that's made in the US and comes in a plastic container.The original from Japan is much better; it dissolves better in water and is a darker green. Plus, the glass container seems to keep the green magma fresher.I'm sure the American version works the same way as the Japanese version, but beware if you're expecting the real stuff from Japan -- this isn't it."
5,Great Product,"Green Magma has given me so much energy and just makes me feel better in general. My skin, hair and nails look healthy again.I have always taken vitamins (I'm 58 and took vitamins back in the 1970's, I used to read Adell Davis'books)yet adding the Green Magma has made all the difference in my day. Try it, you wil feel the difference."
4,"Nice workout for beginners, but....","This set of workout videos are great for beginners because the movements are not over the top, there isn't a bunch of jumping and crazy moves and you most definitely sweat, even if you are in pretty good shape. My only complaint is that the tapes are a little long. The backside is 54 minutes and unless you are motivated, you can get tired and give up too quickly. The cardio kickboxing is about 25 minutes and just the right length. Frontside is good at 42 minutes but once I learned the routines and didn't have to wait for instruction between moves, I can do the circuits in about 30 minutes. I would recommend it for those who are serious and more than casual exercisers."
5,Good exercise.,"While I originally bought this 3 pack DVD work-out for the Cardio Kickbox, I have found that I actually like the for Beginners Frontside and Backside DVD's even more. The circuits are kept nice and short and to the point. Each circuit takes only a few minutes to complete, but still pack a punch and have you feeling the burn in a way that you know it's working. I couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Thanks Jillian!!!"
3,The big Bang is a little chaotic,"There have been several versions of Van Morrison's Bang Masters. This is the legitimate version. The one true classic here is ""Brown Eyed Girl"" but the rest of the album is an exercise in Van finding his Solo voice. His is, without a doubt, one of the greatest voices in Rock history but it is not yet in full strength in this collection. I recommend this album for Van Morrison fans, but for those who only know him for his radio hits, it would be best to start with his Moondance album and work your way from there."
1,Only for hardcore Van fans,"Sorry for offending any Van Morrison die hards but I was disappointed in this album. My disclaimer is that I'm a novice Van Morrison fan - having only purchased Moondance until I bought this and Tupelo Honey while on a road trip. Moondance is brilliant, Tupelo Honey was great on the first listen (that speaks volumes) but Bang Masters was mostly unpleasant with only flashes of potential. I like blues but this didn't do it for me. Just one guy's opinion."
1,Wish I had read more,"I wish I had read the previous post. But I didn't and it is true... you just paid $50 for an OEM version. I'll admit that I got suckered.Beyond that, it does work great. Picture quality is superb, but it will block up on dark areas (to conserve CPU, I assume), which is fairly noticable on LCD's. It also bugs you about upgrading, however, and it's missing quite a few features (the MLP, or DVD-Audio, for example) that because of the box were thought to be included, but no, it's a plug-in that you have to buy.Do, please, stay far, far, away from this version of PowerDVD."
2,Buyer Beware...,"This piano works, for now. The surface is some type of thin plastic, not the vinyl I was expecting. More like mylar. This folded and creased during shipping, and wouldn't play middle C. Once I was able to flatten it out it seemed better. The keys arekind of difficult to press. There are no instructions, so it'll take us a while to figure out the drums and record/playback."
5,Wonderful alternative to a highchair,"This is a great seat! I bought it beacause our small kitchen would not handle a big highchair taking up space. This fits nicely on a standard dining room chair and attaches securely with the provided straps. I put my 6 month old son in it (without the tray) when I am cooking and he enjoys being close to me. I hope to use this seat for a long time.The portability of this seat is another plus. We take it camping to use both in the trailer and to set it on the picnic table at the campground. Because it is so light, I have been known to pick up the seat, with my son in it, and carry him to the basement when I have laundry to do. He really enjoys sitting in this seat with his toys. Many of the best pictures we have of him are in this seat!The bottomline - if you don't have space for or just don't like the look of a mammoth free-standing highchair, this is a wonderful alternative!"
1,Doesn't adjust to the higher level. Cheap construction.,"I second another one star review that the seat would not adjust to the higher level for younger babies; the tabs on the side of the seat are to wide to fit into the slots on the body. Also, the recline feature is almost impossible to use. The construction and design of this chair is just poor."
5,reclining 4 stage feeding seat,It works great. I don't have much space and this is easy to store between feedings.
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!!,"I needed a high chair that would be a space saver and would also allow my 2 month old to be able to sit in it. I had a very hungry baby so at her 2 month check-up the doctor suggested I started feeding her cereal. I looked around for something inexpensive as well as practical that could accomodate a 2 month old. This was it!!! It was the only seat rated for an infant, it has several reclining positions, it fits on any chair and can be removed and attached with ease for portability, the tray can be removed with one hand, and everything is washable! The best thing is that it can be used as a booster seat later on so that you don't have to buy a high chair and a booster seat later!"
1,Doesn't fit any chairs!,"I read tons of reviews raving about this seat, and since we have a small kitchen, I registered for it and received it. Well, it looked great BUT when we tried to place it on our kitchen chair, the base was bigger than our chair (the instructions say that the base must be completely on the chair's seat). We tried it on FOUR different chairs and it didn't fit on any of them! Apparently you must need an XLarge kitchen chair with a wide seat? Anyway, even if it was completely on the seat, any active and kicking child could easily cause it to tip, in my opinion."
2,Impossible,"We havent tested out how good this product is for actual feeding or how long it lasts but I do know that it is almost impossible to recline. I got this when i was 8 months pregnant. We put it together and wanted to test the reclining posistions. I spent nearly a half an hour trying to get it to recline. Two other people tried as well including my husband. It required 2 people. Finally my mother tried squating behind thechair and got it to recline that way, but still couldnt get it upright. One person has to hold the buttons in and another has to push the chair upright. Despite figuring out how to recline it we have to leave the chair reclined all the time because you have to press so hard on the buttons that it leaves your thumbs really aching."
4,Wonderful!,"We have a wooden ""restaurant"" style highchair and a an Eddie Bauer wooden highchair, but I love this one the best. My 4 month old could sit in it (reclined) at the table and be with us during our meals. She loves the attention and we love to have her a part of our family mealtime. I haven't washed the pad yet, but it seems like it will hold up well enough. I should have bought this chair the first time around!"
4,Perfect highchair replacement,"If you lack a lot of space in your dining room or kitchen, as I did when my daughter was born, this is the perfect solution. Instead of purchasing a high chair, we just strapped this chair to a regular dining room chair, and it's worked perfectly. My daughter started using it at 4 1/2 months, even before she could sit up. The reclining positions make it perfect for this."
4,love it!,"We love this portable high chair. It sits on top of our large kitchen island and makes feeding our baby so much easier. He feels part of the action watching us move around the kitchen while he plays with his toys on the tray. He seems to be very comfortable. It is easy to take anywhere and it also sits well and straps safely onto our dining chairs. The back and seat bottom have adjustable recline and heights so that it can be adjusted to fit our son's needs. The reclining mechanism for the back could be better in that it can be quite difficult for one person to adjust the reclining position. That is the only reason that I gave this chair 4 stars. For what it is, it's great."
5,4 Stage Feeding Seat Is Wonderful!,"If anyone needs a safe place for your little one to sit after the bouncy-seat is no longer an option, the 4 Stage Feeding Seat is an excellent alternative. It serves as both a feeding station and chair for the little ones to watch you in the kitchen, bedroom or for them to even watch a video."
3,"Good, but not great","I've had this booster seat for quite some time, and just started to use it. My daughter just turned 2 and we felt it was time to put the highchair away. I had originally bought this booster b/c I liked how it was padded throughout...the only one like this. My daughter is comfortable, but there is one drawback: IT DOES NOT FIT UNDER OUR TABLE. So now, there is a BIG gap between my daughter and our table. I won't use the tray b/c it is just too small (I guess another drawback). If you are going to buy this booster, just make sure it fits under your table."
5,Wonderful!,"I can't say enough about how useful this has been. It was great when our daughter was too small to sit in her high chair but was eating those first solid foods. It turned into the perfect high chair for the grandparents' homes. Over two years later it is still being used as a booster seat (without the tray) at a dining table. It straps securely around the bottom and back of dining chairs, and has a three point harness to keep baby secure. Every parent should have one!"
3,Escape proof and easy to clean and transport,"I received this booster seat and a $200 plus dollar highchair as a shower gift, but recently sold the expensive highchair via consignment and use this booster seat exclusively for my 21 month old son and 7 month old daughter. It accomodates both children with ease and one of the best things about it is that my son cannot wiggle out of the straps to stand up in the seat (like he did with the highchair). It's other ""plusses"" are that it's transportable and cleans easily (the expensive highchair had a cloth seat cover that had to be washed and air-dryed which I surmise was designed by someone without children). The only negative about this great little booster chair is the little placemat - the designs on it are not color fast and come off on the tray when it is washed. I just placed an order for a second one of these booster chairs, so I can feed both of my babies at the same time."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"It's an OK seat. Basically, I found 4 major flaws:1. The upper height adjustment would not stay in place due to low quality bendable plastic.2. You need 3 hands to change reclining positions - 2 hands to push each button on each side and another hand to push or pull the back of the seat.3. The newer model has a full-sized cushion (top and bottom) but it cannot be securely fastened to the seat, causing the baby (6 months) to slump.4. Only in the most up-right position is the tray level. The tray is tilted in the other 2 reclined positions.For $30, I don't think it's worth it. But since I haven't found a more suitable booster seat for my child, I'm going to keep this one for the time being. I could always return it later."
3,good for a start but lacks some features,This is a good item for transition between a bouncer and a high chair. The price a reasonable and its good for travel. I had a couple of problems with it:1. It is not easy to tilt back especially if the baby is sitting in it2. Its not as safe as a chair with a five point harness (like the car seats or most high chairs) our baby would always try to push himself forward to come out of itOverall I guess the price speaks for itself!
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CHAIR!!,My mother bought this chair to use at her house when we were visiting. We quickly realized how much we liked it and now use it exclusively at our house. We loved tearing down our very expensive (Peg Perego) and bulky high chair to be replaced by this space saver! This attached to our dining room chair (or any chair for that matter). My son was in it from 3 months in the fully reclined position (better than our high chair) and is now 2 and still uses it as a booster seat at our table. We would have never purchased a high chair had we explored this option first. We are expecting our second child and have bought a brand new chair for the baby. We are getting rid of our high chair altogether.
1,Old software for old computers,"If you have an older computer (3+ years operating system); then this software is for you..... I happened to have access to an older computer, and the software worked fine, but it was very boring and the kids were not impressed."
2,Too outdated to work!,"I love the DK products, and was looking for MAC compatible software for my youngest (age 5) for Christmas. I couldn't see any information about the system requirements online, and was disappointed to find it would not work on my MAC. It only works on Mac OS 8.0 which hasn't been around for years! It is not even compatible with Classic (mac OS 9). My only option to get it to run is to pick up an old emac from the first run. My son was very disappointed."
1,Took Too Long,"After waiting 12 days I ended up making my own out of a bronze door hinge bushing and a hitch-pin. When it finally arrived, I was glad that I did. These bushings are cheap plastic and I now understand why they don't last very long. I just ordered some more parts and I hope Amazon has not adopted new shipping policies."
5,Great series...where is the DVD?,"This was a strangely addicting series. Weird but in a good way. I dismissed it at first, but it grew on me like a giant brain tumor. Worth a DVD version...but where is it?"
5,M.T.V.'s the head,inventive. a collection of animated hijinks that balances between comedy science-fiction and romance. the creators were truly inspired. a true example of classical action adventure venture. pure greatness.
3,"not even fun, but fun if you took off the decks and made bulkheads","We bought this at Micheal's arts and crafts, We got this model, We know that it comes in a kit, BUT, there was no bulkheads attached underneath, so the boat deck keeps collapsing, My son took the boat deck off and made bulkhead with tape, He didn't even put the boat deck on, He tried to make scrapes off the hull to make it ice berg damage for water to flow, but did not work, so my son opened a hole under the ship, it sunk, He was impressed that no water leaked through the bulkheads, It went over on top!It was very disappointed, but also fun, This model has a 3 rating, -2 due to the bulkheads.Excellent!"
4,Great product!,I purchased this for my 10 year old grandson. He and his father worked on it together and it was a great project for him. He is very proud of the finished model. It is a special hit him as he is an avid reader of all books on the Titanic.
4,Titanic Model,Model was delivered in a timely manner. Wished it had been advertised as to the number of pieces of the model.
4,MOMMY IS HAPPY NOW ! !,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my son. I was unhappy at first cause its not made clear in the discription that you had to assemble yourself and that paint and glue are not included. I contacted the seller by phone and was told that he would correct the problem. He did not evade responsibility and that meant a lot to me. I decided to keep the item due to the level of understanding by the seller plus I think it would be a fun project for me and my son to do together. After I made it clear that I would be keeping the product, the seller decided to go ahead and give me a full refound on my shipping and I saw the refound in my account just minutes later. I thank Megahobby for it's fast response and coutesy. Also, I feel it's important to note that I was told I would not receive this item until after Christmas, on the 29th to be exact but I got it on the 24th, 5 days early and just in time for Christmas. Thank you again to my friends at Megahobby."
3,ok buy,"I bought this for myself but i was disappointed because i thought it would come together, but i should have fun biulding it with my mom"
4,Great,Awesome introduction into anatomy and physiology. Easy to understand language and has supporting diagrams to help process what can be very difficult information.
4,Anatomy and Physiology for Dummies,I purchased this book as a second reference to the E-Z Anatomy and Physiology(Barron's). I refer to it when I am on the edge of understanding and just need a boost for the light bulb to click.
2,Yawn,"I was quite interested in reading this. A dummy book on anatomy would do quite well for my limited knowledge on the subject. However, they say they tried to write it for everyone from us dummies to college students and it just doesn't work well.They start off trying to explain jargon but really don't explain it that well, for instance in the first chapter there's a table with a medical term but maybe only a word or two under definition. And of course they tell you many times we will explain more on that in chapter ##.So I was more than disappointed - I was bored. It just is not a fun read at all."
1,No good for Kindle,"The Kindle edition does not come with the pictures to which the text constantly refers. There are some hand-drawn illustrations throughout the text in the Kindle edition, but the printed version comes with some in-depth pictures to which the text constantly refers the reader for reference. The text reads well, and the book is a descent complement to a textbook. However, without the pictures to reference, the Kindle edition is worthless as a stand-alone source."
4,Good Intro to A&P,Book is set up well for the beginner. I have enjoyed reading some of the information and the illustrations are ok. Not for the serious A&P student but a good place to start.
4,Excellent Introductory and Complementary Material,"This (e-)book has been very successful in explaining the basic ideas of anatomy and physiology. It also adds value by briefly mentioning some of the pathophysiologies of all systems. Moreover it complements my basic understanding of molecular and cell biology. Overall, the material has been laid down in a consistent and an easy-to-follow manner. I highly recommend it to the general audience."
5,Sharon's thoughts,"This is a great book for children and grown-ups,too. Gamma Jan brilliantly teaches children to respect and celebrate differences in others all around the world.This book helps children to understand that we are all truly ""neighbors"" whether we live next door or in another country. It explains that we all have so much is common, although, each of us is unique. It is a happy, good-feeling, educational book and I highly recomment it!!"
4,People say Mingus is BAD for a reason...,"Both this album and its predecessor are two bright points in the 70's jazz canon. This is Mingus at his best. The fury is there, the passion is there, and Jack Walrath and George Adams are there. This is seriously a high point of jazz no matter what the time period, and it is yet again more proof that Mingus was a helluva bandleader, easily on par with Blakey or Miles. If you're looking for some music that can challenge its listeners and still be very listenable, this, along with Changes One, is your album.Keep Your Ears Open,Paul"
4,"Tiny font, but clear.","The font is tiny, but the description said that and my eyes are still pretty good. It's well printed and a good size to carry around - just make sure the lighting will be good wherever you are planning on reading it!"
2,"Conveniently sized for quick reference, too small for devotional use/comfortable reading","Highly portable, too small for comfortable devotional reading. Not ""black imitation"" leather, very cheap paperback binding. Decent for quick reference if without access to a smartphone."
4,Martin from Chevy Chase,"The translation is excellent, as are all JPS translations. Having English and Hebrew side by side is helpful in learning some Hebrew. The only downside is that because it is a soft cover book, and there is so much material, the print is small and can be hard to read."
4,Compact and affordable,A compact version of Tanakh. Essential for those on the go. The side by side Hebrew and English helps with understanding the meanings of passages.
2,Pocket tanaka,Type much too small for mature eyes. If you are price conscious and have good eyes--great deal
2,Maybe I need new glasses...,This is a fine edition but at age 41 I find the Hebrew too small to read. I can just make out the English.
1,printer error,this book went from page 1672 to 1769 then from page 1864 to 1673 then 1768 to 1865 although all pages are there it would be much better to have them in their proper order STILL WAITING FOR REPLACEMENT
1,Book is Backwards,"Let me first say that the information in the book is great, but the product I received is printed backwards. The binding is on the right instead of the left. The name of the book is on the back cover and the beginning of the book starts at the back of the book. The copyright information, the contents, and the preface starts at the back of the book. It is a little disconcerting when reading this book as I must always remember that I am moving from right to left instead of the normal movement from left to right. I don't know why I was sent a copy in this condition. When looking at a preview of the book, the product looked very different."
1,Didn't work,"Was inaccurate, hard to use, and not very comfortable to wear. I mean the thing looks like a giant beetle landed on your wrist. Plus it's ugly.Returned after the first time I used it. Pay the extra $100 or so and get a better one."
1,don't waste your money,"This is the poorest quality, poorest designed model I have ever seen from Revell, and I have seen a few. I have bought 2 of these kits, and they are going into the garbage. The plastic is inconsistently thin, too flexible, and the parts fit so poorly it can't be assembled. This kit either needs to be totally redesigned and remolded. The majority of Revell kits are good quality, but this is one of those that needs to be retired."
3,Huey Hog,"I am no expert but it is a decent model, assembly may be a little difficult. The box that comes with the product is very weak, I received mine and it was dented. Pieces are O.K., detail is good. Do not use super glue to put it together, it will leave white marks on the pieces and terrible stains on the ""glass""."
5,A needed review,"This is a decent model kit. I got it for my brother and he likes it. As long as you're careful assembling it, there shouldn't be any problems. Helicopter propellers can be fairly difficult to assemble, so if you think that could be a problem, get something else."
4,"A bit long in the tooth, some inaccuracies, but a decent kit.","This kit was first produced by Monogram in the '60s, and has been continued to be produced by Revell after the merger of the two companies, and is still very popular.Unfortunately for the true scale enthusiast, it has features of both the ""B"" and ""C"" short cabin Hueys, so it isn't completely accurate for either, and getting the fuselage, roof, nose and windshield together is a bit of a challenge, but with time and care it can be built into a very nice model. Check out [...] to see what can be done with the kit with patience and a little effort.Building helicopter kits is often more ""fiddly"" than building cars, armor or airplanes due to the complexity and small size of the rotor system parts, and Revell rates this kit as a ""Level 2"" in complexity, requiring some modeling experience to succeed. [...]"
2,Poor Quality,"Complexity of model should be LV3. Missing the Pilot foot bubble. Sloppy plastic molding. Details is average. For the price is good, but the over all quality is poor."
3,NOT FOR A BEGINNING MODELLER,This model will challenge your patientce. The parts all have excessive flash to be cleaned off and they dont even come close to fitting without gaps. A lot of sanding and filling will be required for the seams on tail and undercarriage. The fit of the top and windshield is non-existant and must be made. Then when you think you have got it easy and downhill they decals will make you crenge no wet and stick to these it wet and fall off better have a handy supply of decal set and fix. This is almost close to a scratch build when it comes to fitting. If it doesnt drive you crazy it will make you a better builder.
4,Pretty cool,"I bought this as a gift for my friend, who loves helicopters and planes. The box was a little distorted and didn't look as nice as I would have liked, but the kit was very nice and detailed."
3,nice little model even if the fit isn't completely right,"I received one of these a few years ago as a birthday gift and while it isn't the worst model I've ever built, it does have its problemsFirst of all, despite what it says on the packaging, the kit is molded in brown not olive green.Second of all, the fit on the cabin is a bit off. I'm just an aircraft enthusiast, but I'm fairly certain the side of the aircraft is supposed to match up with the top.Again, its not a bad kit overall (and as a matter of fact I plan on acquiring another one of these to make G1 Blades for my 1:48 Autobots) but it does have its problems."
1,DO NOT BUY,I threw away money when I bought this item. Not just that but the delivery job was horrible to. When I received it in the mail the box was all beat up and dented and when I opened it some of the pieces were already broken. The instruction manual on how to put it together was awful and just confusing. The picture on this website is ridiculously misleading and I regret buying this item. I recommend you don't waste the money.
1,This model is too simple for words.,"Although I knew this model wasn't rated high on difficulty, I wasn't prepared for how much detail was missing, how low the tolerances were or how non-instructive the instructions were. The only reason I can see to buy this model is to gain experience on the basics of putting together plastic model pieces."
1,No results,"Foul tasting, made my pee neon yellow and didn't see results after six weeks. Much better off taking an oral antibiotic prescribed by a dermatologist"
4,It works...,"I bought this a while ago. It cleared, probably 75% of my acne with two bottles. I have the oiliest face as far as i know... and Im really cystic. The only problem for me is that it stopped working after a while..."
4,So far so good!,"I have seen an overall improvement in my skin since I started taking these supplements a few weeks ago. Though I'm still getting mild break outs, they go away much quicker. Looking forward to seeing what my skin will look like in a few weeks!"
5,Murad Skin Supplements,"Excellent vitamin supplement, noticeable improvement in my skin. I find this works best as part of a complete Murad regimen."
4,Skin feels great,I only take 2 pills per day (of the recommended 4) and I have to cut them in half because they are too big for me to swallow. I do think my skin looks and feels much better since I started taking them 2 weeks ago. I have had a couple of pimples but they don't seem to last as long or get as bad.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be!,Product very expensive and you have to take it three times a day ~ so you need at least two bottles for an entire month. It's possible that prolonged use would have made a difference but at these prices it wasn't worth the expense especially after no noticeable difference after the first few weeks.
3,murad pure skin,"I usually buy this product from Ulta or Sephora but this time I decide to try amazon because of attractive price. I doubt I received the original produt, the pills have lighter color."
5,How the American Revolution has changed the world,"This charming little book helps remind us just how revolutionary the American idea of liberty and government by the people was when first proposed in the Eighteenth century... and how revolutionary it continues to be in certain parts of the world even today. Reading these excerpts, the one feels as if each of the witnesses called upon to testify spoke to the reader directly from his or her portrait on the opposite page. My favorite passage is from Thomas Paine: ""From a small spark kindled in America a flame has arisen not to be extinguished. Man finds himself transformed, he scarcely perceives how."" The American idea has truly transformed the world more than we often realize."
2,Not worth it,"The quality of the materials is very good. However, the craftsmanship was very bad. The corners will not even line up and only one side is actually straight. It would be disrespectful to my family in Slovakia to display or fly this flag."
1,Early Errol,"Based on hearing one selection from this album on Pandora, I ordered the album from Amazon, as usual. The album is a major disappointment since it is typical of his 51's style which I have outgrown. I regret ordering it and will be more careful in the future.Donald Bruce Maguire"
4,spellbinding,"'Who Runs May Read' is NOT out of print. I managed to pick up a copy (recently published March 2000)online. For lovers of Brion Gysin this book is a treasure as it touches on many of the subjects that made Gysin such an important artist. Covered is his views on art-""TO PROVIDE EXTREME EXPERIENCE""-,2 interviews which fill in some of the gaps in the Gysin biography and a fascinating outline for the never published novel: No Name Hotel. There is also a lengthy piece about Gysin's trip to the mountain fortress of Hassan i Sabbah. The featured calligraphy in the book is also a bonus. Hopefully with the publication of such books more people will discover Brion Gysin and he will receive the credit he so richly deserves."
4,Divine Sex huh?,"I found this book interesting after I first read it. However after researching the topic further, men and women are in FACT ""designed"" to mate with ONE person. The more partners a person has, the less oxytocin is released during orgasm. Couples who are monogamous together, will have a deeper connection that means something more than numerous partners ever would. This is NOT what the author(s) of this book want you to believe. I would change my rating if I could. IMHO this guy has spent a lot of time trying to argue one point that is against the human biology design. Hence the reason he likes to repeat himself. All he did was repeat the same point over again with different words. Once I read more on the subject I now realize how dumb of a guy he really is."
1,Are you kidding me?!,"OK, so the author quotes Bible verses. Big deal! This book is just a way to justify sex outside of marriage. God speaks in many verses of the Bible how sexual immorality is not for anyone outside the bonds of marriage. Yes, I've read it, and I do not recommend it! You are on dangerous ground if you think this book says it better than God's own word, the Bible."
3,"Flimsy bag, but very pretty","I am going to send this to a family member, so I can speak to long-term use. But it looks nice, good cheap gift."
1,Memory Foam Lumbar Cushion,The cushion is too soft; does not provide support as needed. Two other people tried it out for awhile and had the same opinion
1,Not memory foam,"I bought this cushion to use for driving and sitting in an easy chair at home - I have lower back pain. I had just bought a memory foam top for our old mattress, so I was looking forward to the feeling of the back cushion molding and conforming to my lower back. No such luck - this cushion is made of standard foam, not memory foam. It springs back to its original shape right away, and does not conform to pressure like memory foam does. Other than that, it's not a bad cushion, just misrepresented, in my opinion."
1,Terrible support and not a good fit for car,"Bought this in anticipation of getting back pain relief during car ride to the office. Overall a terrible match for my car. Elastic strap will not fit over seat - I have no idea what type of seat this is designed to fit, my car seat is normal size. It has bolsters on side that are creat too narrow an opening for a decent fit across back. Not impressed as product dimensions and description do not qualify it well."
1,Poor Quality,Very poor quality. No support at all. Can be squeezed into almost nothing. Low grade fabric cover. No zipper. All around cheap and poor quality. Such a waste of time to order.
3,Fine for the money,"I'm writing this review for my son who has suffered from compression fractures and we were recommended to get him a support for the car. Needless to say there are many out there and with the exception of a custom made one it's very hard to know which will or will not work. This was inexpensive compared to others being sold so felt it was a good first try, without breaking the bank. I think it is perhaps 80% effective for his needs and for now it is working, so if your looking not to spend a lot of money experimenting than I would recommend this as something to start off with."
3,"Wonderful, Two objections","First of all, I loved this production. Musically it's superb. I was perplexed by what appeared to be a ""lack of set,"" but the program notes described the process by which the designer and director used the bare-bones theater to make a lot of things work rather well.Then, there was the ending. I wasn't really happy with its unsettled nature, but, again, the program notes were helpful in unpacking this choice.Plus, I'd buy the thing just to hear ""Soave sia il vento."""
5,SANDISK- simply the best,This is my third purchase of Sandisk micro SD memory and haven't had any problems with any of them.
2,Do your homework on this one prior to buying,"I purchaesd this card for my new Nokia cell phone so I could download music and use the cell phone as an MP3 player.All worked well until I filled 1/2 of my new 2g card, and then it would not accept any more info.SanDisk is pretty much impossible to get on the phone and so I will probably never be able to utilize the entire capability of the card.However, the price was so good that I am still getting a reasonable return on what I paid for it.Just be careful and know what our equipemtn capabilities are and how they will all work together prior to purchasing this for your use. You may end up in the same situation I am in."
5,It does it,"The card works good. The speed is reasonable, it isn't too low. I can keep buying Sandisk memory cards."
5,Flawless Performance,I bought this card for my Samsung u740 Verizon cellphone. It stores all my mp3 files and works perfectly both in transfer and playback.
5,Sandisk means quality,"Sandisk memories are excellent. I bought this for my cell phone and it works 100% of the time. I use Sandisk memories on my Kindle, cameras, and language translator. You can't go wrong with Sandisk."
5,Sooo Muuuuuuuuuuch Rooooom,"This Card works perfectly in my Verizon VX8600. Not to mention it was a great deal. I recommend to anyone who owns that phone! I don't use verizon's phone sync pack, I just put the card in the sd adapter that it comes with then put that into the slot in my printer and put mp3's on it by dragging and dropping into the music folder. Get this now its great!"
3,Sandisk Micro SD2 2 GB Card,"I purchased this card to use in my BlackJack phone to store music and apps. It seems to work well, but the BlackJack's Activesync software wouldn't acknowledge the card. This is not a problem with the card, but rather a problem with the BlackJack's clunky software.Overall, the I like having the card. Also, the card was shipped quickly (received in 5 days by USPS). I am satisfied."
2,Annoying order,Well the product that was sent to me was damaged. would not work at all with anything. they did return my money but still wanted the damaged item back.
5,Excellent Value,"I bought this card for use with my SanDisk mp3 player (the e260, I believe), and it works like a charm. The beauty of it is that when I add songs for a given band or artist, they are automatically added in order to the albums already in the mp3 memory. Excellent."
5,Sandisk Micro SD 2 GB memory card,I bought this on amazon a couple of months ago for $39.99 and it was a great deal then and now I see that it's $20.14. If you need a micro SD memory card then jump all over this. You can't beat that price and they work great. This a great product and a great value.
5,"Great product, great price","I ordered two of these cards for my two LG cell phones. Now I can hold about 1000 songs in each phone. Great product, huge capacity, and a fantastic price (compared with local retailers)."
4,Nikonuser1,"I am glad that I purchased this 2GB card for use in my Garmin GPSmaps 60CSx. With all of the individual maps that must be downloaded from the Garmin software, I believe i will need this extra memory when going on trips. It was easy to install and works just fine."
5,Awesome,"This little bugger works amazing and it super cheap! Considering I think they cost atleast over $10.00 at walmart, but I hear $14.00! It shipped fast and I had standard shipping! There are no cons only pros for this beast! It worked in my phone and anywhere else I plugged it in! Most likely in the future I will be puchasing more!"
1,2gb for over $5 - overpiced.,"Title says it all, but I ordered it anyway for my Garmin unit. Worked great for about 2 weeks then I cannot get this to respond. Not worth the money to give it back to the manufacturer, I'll just eat the cost and use my other 2gb i had from 5 years ago."
5,Perfect,"I haven't had any problems with this product at all. It came with little more and nothing less than what I needed, and included some kind of adapter thing that I didn't need, but is useful for cameras and the like. Overall, it was exactly what I expected, which is perfectly fine."
3,2G's in such a small package,This is a lot of memory for a great price. I am very happy with the purchase.
5,Gets the job done.,"The SanDisk 2 GB SD is a simple piece of technology, yet it gets the job done, simply put. Whether its storing photos on your cell phone or digital camera, or playing music and video on your MP3, this SD is all you need if you're looking for a quick solution to your storage problems. I used it for putting music on to playback on my cellphone, works perfect."
5,Works with ATT Samsung a737 and LGcu720 Shine,Inserted the cards into the 2 cell phones quickly and easily. Wasn't sure if the microsd 'HC' would work so got these instead.
4,Worked great,"Was a nice addition to the cellphone. Plays music, transfer data, all around nice thing to have."
4,only one drawback,the thing is great. unfortunatly i wanted for a mobile phone to store music. is seems that most phones can only handle 1 GB.
5,Works great!,"Works as advertised, comes with an adapter allowing you to plug it into any reader that takes an SD card."
4,Works like a champ ...,"It comes with an SD adapter which is very typical for these micro cards. What I actually really needed was a mini adapter. To be fair, I didn't find anyone that was selling that combination. So, I bought this and a separate mini adapter. Will I ever use the SD adapter? Maybe. If they had included a mini adapter somehow this would be a solid 5 in my book."
3,"Good price, Awkward Design","Nice product, but it's just really hard to take the microSD card out of the adapter. I usually have to make 3-4 attempts to get it out. I wish they would make a more intuitive design, because once it gets stuck its annoying to pull out, not to mention I need to take it in and out to add photos and music."
5,Excellent card and a steal at 25 bills,I was looking for an affordable option to upgrade my Sansa Mp3 player ( NO IPOD FOR ME) from a 2gig to a 4 gig and this was JUST what I was looking for.Fantastic quality and price.
4,Not sure who to blame,I was mostly happy with this product. I didn't have any real issues with it but I didn't get to use it very much. I tried to use it in conjunction with the R4DS Revolution for my Nintendo DS and it worked for all of 30 minutes before something gave in and my DS failed to recognize it anymore. I can't rightfully blame this card since it still works flawlessly on my PC and I think it was the R4DS card instead but I can't help but feel a little cheated that it did not work as advertised.
5,SanDisk 2GB Micro SD,"No problem. Purchased for phone and worked fine, used the adapter to load info from computer, that also worked fine. Amazing size for the capacity."
4,Excellent product,"Can't imagine how I've been living without an extended memory for my pearl. I've been using this Sandisk memory card for about a month now. I've loaded 200 video songs and a couple of movies. It is definitely exciting to have all of them in the mobile phone. This Sandisk card had proved to be very reliable in storing all of them, and letting me access without any time delay. Even though the real 'available' memory is only 1.8 GB, it is still a lot of space."
5,Works great with BlackBerry Pearl,"I already own one of these (or a similar brand) - I purchased this one as a gift. It receives and transfers data fast (provided your computer has USB 2.0) and works just as expected. No complaints or issues from the gift receiver. They highly recommend this product, and I do as well. If you purchase this one, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Tiny, stable, good.",There's not a lot to write for this review. The device is just CRAZY small for holding 2GB. It is solid. It worked the first time and worked well since. I use it in my Blackberry 8300 (Curve) and have had no issues at all.
3,BOO,THIS MICRO CAME WITH NO ADAPTER SO ITS GREAT FOR STORAEG BUT NOT FOR TRANSFERE (IF YOU DONT HAVE A DATA LINK CABLE)AS I USE IT IN MY PHONE IT WORKS FOR CAMERA AND VIDEO OPTIONS BUT AGAIN IM GOING TO HAEV TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PURCHASE FOR AN ADAPTER FOR MY LAPTOP
3,Good so far,"Fits my cellphone, but sometimes the phone can't find it until I remove and put it back in. Happened twice already. The Lexar MicroSD I had was more reliable. Otherwise, it is working well enough."
5,Great Memory Card,"This is a memory card that fits both my camera phone and camera. I would only need an adapter to plug it into. I had bought a few adapters overtime and used one of them This is a great memory chip that will even work with some camcorders for at least the still pics. Overall it is a multipurpose memory card that will work with anything that supports Secure Digital or SD memory if you have the right adapters for them. I don't think the one I bought works with card readers or printers though, but then again I really can do without that. Good product overall."
3,More bloatware,"My only gripe: it lists itself as having 2 GB of memory. It doesn't. It has 1 GB of memory, and the other gig is wasted with who knows what bloatware that sandisk put on it for who knows what reason. This is like a free Chinese made thermos I got as a gift for some mail-order item I bought awhile ago. It clamed to hold a quart. It actually was only a pint sized container. i.e. Accurate labeling is required in my book.The card works like any other card, meaning, it holds stuff. Whoopee. It does what it's supposed to. It just doesn't hold the amount it claims to."
2,either i'm doing something wrong or....,"...2GBs are 900MBs in micro SD language.Well, i haven't been able to store more than approx. 900 MBs in this card.I don't know why, can't fix it, suggestions Sandisk people or anyone???"
1,2.0 gb??? what are they talking about?,"I started adding files to this card to use in my phone, but it has never shown more than 1 gb capacity even though it is printed 2.0 gb on the face. I have contacted Sandisk just earlier tonight to find out what is up with this card. So far I am more confused than pleased."
1,Ordered - Cancelled,"I ordered - received an email ""ordered Cancelled"" no reason. Pretty poor customer relations amazon."
4,Great Product,lots of storage space. perfect for lots of songs and pictures to be stored on my phone.
5,Great product,"Great product, Worked in all my computers except one but it is probably a glitch with this one laptop. The price I paid for this item was awsome, I dont belive you will get it any cheaper. Thanks for all the work that the Amazon staff does to make these great deals happen."
4,help,"i was wondering if i could put this into my laptop HP and upload music and photos on there.... or do i need liek a converter thingy? please help, thanks a bunch! :)"
5,Roomy,This micro SD drive offers me plenty of space to essentialy turn my phone into a small MP3 player. I don't keep it completely full because I also have my phone save all pictures and videos to it and I've never run short on memory yet.
4,"Ok game, some flaws","This game suffers from the same flaws that Indiana Jones for the Xbox suffers, no in level saves. So if you die at the end, you start all over at the start of the level. Also, Mr. Fleenor, if you pull in your claws, Woverine heals at a rapid rate.But as a whole, rent, do not buy this. It is worth a look but not worth [$$$]"
5,wolverines back,i have the version of the games on ps2 but i guess there almost the same. The graphics are great and so is the games play.
1,worst Marvel game ever,"If you are looking for a great Marvel game by Activison try Spiderman. This game is terrible. I rented this game, played through it, and I must say the plot and the character voices are amazing, but if it is gameplay you are looking for go somewhere else. In the comics and the movies, Wolverine has the power to heel from damage inflicted from the enemy, but in the game you have to go around looking for health bars. Automatic heeling would great, and very helpful in this game.Bottom line:Not worth renting, much less buying!"
4,convenient,This is a good pair of scissors. they are small enough to fit in your pocket and sharp enough to cut plastic. so far so good.
4,earring tree,"Sometimes it is difficult to get in the hanging type earrings without stretching open their backs, thus weakening their metal."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this item because my friend has over 50 pairs of earrings so I figured it would be a nice gift but when I opened it, it wasn't what I expected. Some of the holes are not drilled all the way through, so you can't put earrings in them, and the object overall is not in good shape. It's ok as a cheap gift, but it's nothing great."
5,Gift for a friend,Great for holding all kinds of earrings. I really love it. really good for displaying some of your costume earrings.
1,poorly designed for earrings on a U-hook,"I really like the way this organizer looks and the number of earrings it should hold, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. It is fine if your earrings are on posts, but if you have many which are on the u-shaped hook, they are very difficult to mount on the display. Between the small hole and the distance between the hole and the outside edge of the acrylic the U hook on many of my earrings could not be threaded through the hole. I ended up re-drilling some of the holes and enlarging them, which helps, but the screen is poorly designed."
3,Works,"Works ok, but really not my favorite. I wear glasses sometimes and really have to have them on to be able to see where you are lacing earrings on this unit. It's ok, works"
1,This earring holder is terrible,"I found it so frustrating that this product arrived broken! Evidently others have had the same experience with this product. It was cracked throughout and the hinges did not even work. My husband suggested it might still be usable, but then I showed him how sharp the cracked areas are...not safe in the least. Perhaps it's no coincidence that this item gets less expensive every time I go to the page where it is sold on Amazon. It's horribly made. I paid $15 and now it's being sold for $12. It started around $30. I think they should pay you to use such a bad product."
1,Broken and Disappointed,"The earring rack was so poorly packaged that it was broken into several pieces by the time it arrived. I then had to pay the shipping charges to return the broken item. My choices then were to either: 1) ask for a replacement item and hope it also wasn't broken, or 2) eat the cost of the shipping (x 2, as I had to pay the original shipping and then pay to return it). I chose #2 as I was sure a replacement was very likely to also be broken. Since I was paying for the shipping costs, there doesn't seem to be much motivation for the company to improve their packaging."
3,no large earrings and no tiny earrings,It is good for cheap jewelry next to the bathroom sink (I would never put expensive jewlry next to a drain). That is my idea for it.
4,kh,"I really like being able to see all of my jewelry at the same time. The screen seems sturdy enough. Only conplaint is that your can't really put small hoops in the straight holes, and the hoops are too small to hook around the projected spaces for hoops."
2,earing screen.,Not thrilled. have to put the earrings on several times. They fall off too easily. I Would not purchase again.
1,Most earrings don't fit on this screen,"This is the most ridiculous earring holder on the market. I bought a two-screen holder many years ago and love it, but I've since acquired many more pairs of earrings and need more storage space. I looked on the internet and in stores for months before buying this product. But what a disappointment! The bottom set of holes on each row is too high to accommodate any earrings except posts. Notice in the photo that even the earrings shown don't seem to fit right.So just when I was about to toss the thing, my engineer husband asked what would be needed to make the product work best. I said that the holes needed to be placed on the lower edge of the row so all earring could dangle. So he drilled new holes! Now the product is perfect.If you don't have a drill or a handy friend, don't buy this poorly designed product. Keep looking."
3,Not as sturdy as it looks,"I bought this for my wife who wasn't sure at first but then decided she loved it. It did hold all the earrings, and looked good on the dresser, but an unfortunate fall from the dresser top to a carpeted floor resulted in the thing's demise. I think all the hinges broke, rendering it unusable. The concept is good, but the durability is questionable."
1,Too flimsy and lightweight..,"I was very disappointed by this item. Yes, it folds and appears to be sturdy, but in reality, it also unfolds and collapses quite easily. There's something about plastic holding up over 120 pairs of earrings that now makes me nervous because you'd be surprised how much 120 pairs of earrings actually weighs. When this unfolds and falls, earrings break. Also, the holes are drilled very close together which makes taking off post earrings difficult because not only are you trying to balance the holder, you also have to pull off earring backs in too small a space. This was what I was doing when my display unfolded and fell flat on my dresser, cracking one of my crystal earrings and dislodging a stone from another. I now use this display only for wired earrings and purchased one of the metal harp displays to hold my post earrings. The metal displays were so much more stable and cost only a few bucks more."
3,Doesn't work with hoops,"I like this earring holder, and it was relatively inexpensive. It works very well for my french-hook earrings. Post earrings are OK, but it's a little bit tricky to pull them off without tipping over the whole thing. However, it's a huge pain to hang up any earrings with the clasped french-hook (the kind that has a hook, but also a back that snaps into place). I basically ended up leaving them unclasped and draped over the edge - it looks like they'd fall over easily. I couldn't get any of my hoops onto this thing - not the hoops with the post-back, hoops with a snapping back, nor the hoops that make a perfect circle. I have big ones and small ones, but I couldn't get any onto this thing.THE GOOD:-Works well with french-hook earrings-Inexpensive-Works with post earrings-Folds up so it can be easily moved.THE BAD:-Doesn't work with hoops-Isn't particularly attractive-Hinges squeak-Doesn't work well with Leverback hooks"
1,"Great idea, poor execution","I loved the idea that this earring tree folded. All the decorative ones take up so much space. But as other reviewers have noted, the constuction is shoddy and the design is poor. The holes are too small so it is a struggle to get earrings on and off of it. If I can't get a pair of earrings in a moment, then why not just keep them in an old fashioned jewelry box? But worst of all, the thing tips over very easily and the first time it did, it broke. Taking my earrings off to return it, it tipped again and broke in another place. Waste of time and money!"
4,Easy storage,"I have a lot of new earrings, so I bought this. It has a lot of space and is pretty easy to put in earrings. My only issues are that it's a little bit hard to put in hook earrings the first few times. Also I don't know if really big hoops would fit, I wear smaller earrings and it's fine but if you wear mostly big hoops I would suggest something else."
4,Delivers What They Say,Product was delivered in a timely manner. Practical and attractive gift item. Solid trustworthy dealer.
4,Great for most earrings.,This is perfect for most earrings. It is a little tough for leverbacks but I have really enjoyed it.
4,Definitely something I needed!,"This earring stand is actually quite beautiful for its simplicity. It works incredibly well for organizing your earrings instead of having them sprawled on your desk. One of my minor complaints is for the kind of earrings that are made to wrap around the bottom part of your lobe and latch on behind, those earrings don't really attach well but that doesn't necessarily prevent it from being latched onto the stand in an odd manner :P"
4,just what i wanted,"i've been looking for an earring holder for years that can hold as many earrings as i have. this is it. others never had the capacity for even 15 earrings, let alone OVER 100 EARRINGS (yes i did the math/counted once i got this in the mail). it also lets you put in dangle hook earrings as well as studs; it's got spaces for both.it's adjustable nature is also great. you can squeeze it into tight spots for storage on your shelf, then bring it out later and unfold it to find your earrings."
4,clever!,I bought this for my wife thinking it may be a typical cheap plastic gizmo... I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. For the price I found it pretty rugged & my wife finds it very useful. It holds all her earings & still has room for more!
4,"Spacious, sleek but not for every piece","This is a great way to organize your earring collection (and I realized I had room for a lot more - YAY!). However, because I live in a humid climate, the silver ones oxidized a lot faster on this - out in the air than they had in a closed jewelry box. Not a product problem, but something to be aware of as you look for solutions to organizing your jewelry. I now have 2 systems..."
2,Earring Holder,"I was very disappointed with this item, as 50% of my earrings will not fit on on the holder due to either size of the earrings, or how they are held on the ear. It seems to be fine for most earrings with posts. I will use it for those earrings that work, and find something else for the rest."
3,It's ok,"Yes, it holds a lot of earrings, but very difficult to maneuver the earrings in the holes. Some of my earrings were distorted because of this. Also, when it is closed, some of the earrings fall out. Very frustrating."
3,broken,The item arrived on time but It was broke in half when I opened it. I would ask for a bottle of glue to come with it.
2,Probably would have liked it,I think I would have liked the product but it arrived damaged. I requested a replacement but they would only give me a refund.
3,earring holder,The item is nice but it does not fit all kind of earring. You can only hang some earring it was not what I expected.
5,Great earing organizer!,"We originally bought this as a present for my sister in law, but my wife liked it so much that I had to get another one for her. The Amazon packaging was really good, it came in a tight box, the material feels sturdy, this is high quality acrylic, it has plenty of space for hanging earrings and necklaces. I would recommend it!"
3,it was the best thing I found for what I was look for but....,"I have been looking for something that hold more than a few pairs of earring, all different styles. This was the best I could find. I works ok but it is a little hard to get some types of earrings to hang on it. The holes should have been made alot bigger. You end up just hanging everything. Thats ok, but nothing is secure on it. If it fell over, you would have a mess."
4,Earring Rack Review,"The rack is everything I expected. It's not damaged and arrived in a timely fashion. The only thing I didn't like about it is that you can't really travel with it because everything would just fall out. Other than that, its ok."
3,Pretty cool,I love the idea of this product. It keeps my earrings all in one easy to find place...I actually bought two. The only complaint I have about it is it's hard to fit some larger hoop earrings in it and the two outside panels on the outside of the screens doesn't protect the backing and posts of the earrings so that they are exposed to dust.
4,Nice holder,It is a nice earring holder but some of the holes are too close together. Some of my eariings are too close together eventhough they are all posts.
1,ALL CODES GET DELETED FOR NO REASON!!!,"This is a copy of the mail I have sent to the company requesting their help. Let's see what they advise and if they care about their customer or care more about money. Before you buy this product find out what type of support you will get. Remember, there is no way to download codes directly back into the unit. Once deleted, it's gone.My son has been using the action replay for GBA for several months now without a problem. All of a sudden today, he turns it on and all the games and codes are deleted. Why did this happen? You cannot delete all the games at once, only one game at a time. We do not use any other cheat code device. We have not entered a new code into the Action Replay recently. We have entered codes and there has been no problems. So why did this happen and what can be done to restore the codes."
4,Action Replay is very sweet.,"This is a awesome cheat system, its very reliable and has cool cheats. It sometimes messes up your game, But its not a high price to pay for a good as it is. They have a good staff to help you with code problems or questions. If your thinking about getting it I highly think its worth it."
4,It Goes Halfway.,"When I bought my Action Replay an used it for the first time on Pokemon Sapphire it worked great. Then I expanded it's uses to a variety of games. Recently though, when I download codes for Fire Emblem from the internet to my AR it goes to 502/3200 and crashes, the download stops and as an added bonus :| it wipes my AR clean. So I might buy a GS instead."
1,Definitely Flawed,I wish that I had taken the time to read other reviews before my 8 1/2 year old son spent his saved money for this product. He was truly crushed when the product didn't work. We went to their website and attempted to enter new codes following instructions very carefully yet nothing worked. Then all in the same sitting it stopped recognizing Fire Red and emptied all data. It had no more games and cheats saved. He was beside himself. You cannot get your money back for opened electronics so we're going to have to bite the bullet on this one. Very frustrating. If I had read above reviews I would have DEFINITELY encouraged him to buy something else.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"My son was saving money to buy the Action Replay for his GBA - finally he had it. He got it and tried it out - at first is was working great - THEN he puts in a Mario game - the screen read NBA Jam game! He continued - WELL - needless to say it froze the game, didn't work right etc. He was really dissappointed.Think twice about this product before you buy it."
3,GBA Action Replay: good or bad?,"From my own experiences,and other people's warnings,the Action Replay isn't all it's cracked up to be. Sure,it may give you the best cheats in the history of gaming,but it has it's down side.For example,in Pok'emon Ruby and Sapphire,if you put more than one new Pok'emon cheat code in the GBA Action Replay,you get Bad Eggs. If Bad Eggs hatch,they freeze up your game.Otherwise,they delete your pok'emon.I like to call it,""THE CURSE OF THE BAD EGGS"".But worse of all,over the course of three years or more,it will erase your game file,no matter what. Only two of the three glitches I've mentioned have happened to me,but all three have happened to Blake,a friend of mine who told me about the final glitch for the good of my gaming future. Take my word for it,I've owned this darn thing for a year. So for those of you who want to buy an Action Replay,think again."
2,I Can't Get This to Work!,"It might be a great product if I could get it to work for either Pokemon Leaf Green, Fire Red, or Emerald. The instructions are not clear and everything I've looked up and tried hasn't helped. AR will not start for Emerald or Fire Red. It will start for Leaf Green, but nothing seems to work. I'm trying to get the ""Encounter Pokemon"" codes to work. If you have gotten this to work on Leaf Green, please tell exactly how you managed to do this. What game name you selected? What AR codes was checked? For instance,(m), Encounter Pokemon, Choose One, Mew. Where in the game did you catch the pokemon? Was the AR plugged in while playing the game? This is stuff the instructions should tell. Thanks in advance."
1,Action Replay,"works well for a while, but after about a month you get an error and it doesn't work anymore. i have had no success in finding a way to fix it. not worth paying 20 bucks for."
1,ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST,"This works great for about two months. You have a happy child that has saved his allowance money for this. Then, one day he turns it on and everything is GONE!!!! Then your child is heartbroken!!!Read the other reviews...beware."
2,"Pretty cool but, what about the quality","The Action Replay is a cool game cheat enchacer but it dosen't last anything! This is like the 5th Action Replay i bought it turns blank, it erases codes and everything if they gave this at a bubble gum price for it's duration it will be ok. Overall this is a pretty cool system."
2,what's wrong,"my friend and i have a action replay. both of us have pokemon firered and leafgreen. I have ruby and emerald. for him he has all legendary pokemon expet raikou. for me it doesnt work on firered. i havent tried the gameshark, so get the gameshark or get a ds and get the new action replay."
4,Great Device,"I'm the kind of player who likes to beat a game on my own and then go back with a cheat device and play it in an enhanced mode of some sort.I'll also use a cheat for a game that is fun but way too hard.This system works great on my GBA SP, And While I've only used it a couple of times, The PC link is great. It automatically detected that my firmware needed to be upgraded and did so. and downloading the new codes I wanted was very easy.The only reason I didn't rate the device 5 out of 5 is that it is kind of bulky. I know that it can't be helped, but it still affects my opinion.I've had more luck with my AR devices than I had with my Game shark devices."
2,Not the greatest thing in the world.,"I like, it its just you can't play it with older games. It also didn't have cheats for Tak and the Power of Juju or Spyro 2. When i played it on Pokemon Sapphire and got all the HMs,every time i went to the TM and HM pack it froze and I had to restart my gameboy."
4,"Very Good,but a downside",Action Replay has tons of great cheats you can activate.But in a short time it can break down.Trust me make sure you have a reciet.
2,GAMEBOY ADVANCED ACTION REPLAY,The action replay is great on some games but on others it freezes and messes up your whole game so you have to start all over. I give the action replay 2.4 stars. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,ERASED ALL MY CODES!!!,"Bought this product on 11/18/04 from Walmart and for the first week it worked great. It had over a hundred games preloaded in, and I was able to add new codes to the game. Unfortunately I assumed too much, and assumed that it would work flawless, so I threw away my receipt and the box and only kept the manual and game.However just today I loaded this unit, and all my codes were ERASED!! I did not do anything, the machine just erased all my codes! What a piece of junk!"
2,Not Worth It,"I recently purchased this product for about $20. It doesn't work very well. It does all kinds of weird things. Sometimes when I use it, my Gameboy advance won't start up. Other times, it crashes my games.The software that comes with his game is also faulty. Often, I only get part of the text. It is also very confusing.Overall, I wouldn't buy this product."
5,AR #1,I think the action repaly is good because it provides you with games then I click on the game and it comes up with a list of different cheats.
4,sounds cool!,I have a $25.00 gift card and i am going to go buy an action replay. My friend has it and I loved it. it will really help me out on my ruby. THIS THINGY IS A MUST HAVE! Get you bum up and go get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Quite helpful,but very cheap","This little gadget helped me with my GBA games like a charm,until,one day,it stopped working.I don't know how,but nothing worked,but I wasan't surprised.I have many things to tell you about action replay-I got action replay for PS2 and quess what,it didn't work!not one code worked!-(this next one scored me a free game!) My friend used his GameCube Action Replay to be invincible in the game ""skies of Arcadia"" The only problem? the game always froze when he entered the door where the final boss rests. It was all action replay's fault because it worked fine on my GameCube!So,action replay is quite cheap,and the only thing I can recommend from them is their ""ultimate codes"" disks,they seem to be the only things actually work and don't permenantly screw up your system."
4,the AR is same as gameshark......,"Currently I don't have the AR.I have my Ruby and LeafGreen versions of Pokemon, I work more in my Ruby Version because only 3 Pokemon gives me a headache, Deoxys, Feebas and Milotic. I tried to see the ugly ""Feebas"" again.I did see many tricks to get it, Dewford City Trendy Phrase... blah, blah, blah, however I didn't get it... though. :(Now I see what offer me the AR... some pros and only few cons...It's great, but first think if you REALLY need it or not before get it."
3,Don't let the 3 star rating throw you off!,"For 10 bucks, you can't go wrong. I paid $20(with shipping)on ebay and love it. Don't expect a 'spotlight'though. LED ligts don't have a long 'throw', but for walking or changing a tire or an area light, like in a tent, it's ideal. It emits a nice almost pure white 'smooth' beam. which will dim when he batteries weaken, but doesn't 'yellow'. The 10-light feature conserves batteries. I only gave it 3 stars because I would have liked a little more 'heavy-weight'construction, and even though I find the output sufficient, I wish it were brighter. Buy it - you'll like it."
4,Handy Dandy,"Gave two of these for Christmas and they were very well received. My husband liked them so well he asked me to order one for him. He uses it daily in the shop, to walk the dog, to see some detail better, etc. The way it stands makes it very convenient. Adjustable light level is nice. Price is a little high. No one can have too many kinds of flashlight."
3,ok for the right price,I received this item when it was on sale for ten dollars. It runs off of D batteries or if you have an adapter you can plug it in the bottom.The head pivots and I have not had the other reported problem of light intensity changing while pivoting the head.The light is dual power. It has two rows of ten led's and you can operate one or both rows. The light is meant to be a flood light. It is good for general illumination but it is not designed to be carried around or thrown around too much. It is made of hard plastic and the quality leaves much to be desired.I would not pay more than ten dollars for each light.
4,Great for my needs,"After the ""Big"" Hawaii earthquake last month which knocked out the electrity in Honolulu for over 14 hours it was obvious an emergency light better than candles was needed. I wanted something to read by especially and when I tried this it's perfect. I'm not taking it out so the rather flimsy constrution is fine. And for my purpose anything over 15-20 bucks seemed excessive."
4,bright lights,"the lights are what i expected and work well. did have a problem with one of them being put together incorrectly. the contacts for the batteries were reversed and i had to pull out the metal plate and turn it around. worked fine after that, what do you expect made in china. other then that they work fine. would recommend them for emergency lights and others."
1,Dimly Lit,"Very disappointed in light output. Also, description implied there was a 120 volt adapter but that was not included. Have returned the merchandise for credit (three weeks ago!!)"
2,The lanterns I received were not Innovage,"As stated, the two lanterns were not Innovage. The name name Innovage did not appear anywhere on the packaging. The battery covers did not fit well. The soft plastic sleeve on the stem was not stuck on. I used black electrical tape to fix the problems rather than sent the lanterns back. The illumination and electrical performances seem OK for the moment. These two items were not the same as the Innovage lantern that I already possess.alsoThis is the second review that I have submitted."
1,WORST $12 I EVER SPENT,This lamp broke as I was taking it out of the plastic package. MINUS 5 STARS!!!!!!!
5,Innovage Outdoor 20 LED Lantern,"I bought six of these for presents and everyone loved them. My brother-in-law wanted another, and I bought two more. The batteries last a long time. The light is sufficient but not extremely bright. The shape is convenient when doing jobs that require 2 hands."
5,Flashlight,"We bought one at a local store and liked it so well we went to get more and they were out. Found them here and ordered 8. Great for power outages. We gave one to each kid, our care giver, great to keep in trunk. The top swivels so you can position light as needed. Bright enough to change a tire or walk out to the mail box (our driveway is 500 feetlong)Great product."
5,Keeing us out of the dark,I already had one of these and got two more. They are light in weight and provide plenty of light output. The form factor is great since they will stand up several inches from the ground on their own. That way you don't have to have a 3rd arm when you need light somewhere you are working.
3,Lasts a long time!,"When I first got this I was disappointed. The light output is just not that great for that many LEDs. But as I used it, I discovered that it lasts a really long time on it's batteries. And it's tilting on it's base is very convenient. I'm ordering another one."
3,Easily breaks,I got a couple of these because I love everything that has LEDs on it. Rubberized handle and switch. Rite Aid usually carry this on their sale shelves for $9.99.Pros:-It stands on its own-The head can be tilted to adjust aiming-priceCons:-The main problem is the switch. 1 lasted 6 months and the other only a couple of months. Now they refused to turn off even if I press the switch repeatedly. I have to remove the batteries to turn it off.-Given the number of LEDs; it is not very bright.-Weird looking-Cheap looks
4,Mask actually works well,"I recently bought this mask because of ear problems preventing me from going underwater. I had my doubts about this mask. I didn't think there was any way it could keep water out of my ears. To my surprise, it actually works well. It was hard to get on at first, but you get used to it. I never got any water in my ears. The mask will come off if you jump hard into the water. Other than that, the mask has always stayed on. The mask is a little tight on the face, but that is expected. The mask seems to be well built, you just have to be careful when putting it on. I would recommend this product to anyone who has ear problems. It is well worth the money to experience the underwater feeling."
3,cheap,When I received the package it looked like Ace Ventura Pet Detective delivered it. The box was mangled to say the least. As soon as I put the mask on the plastic clip that holds the strap broke. So I put a small bolt in its place and the mask worked great. Y
1,Not as great as I had hoped,"I have a perforated ear drum and I thought that the ProEar2000 would let me be able to swim without getting water in my ears. I was wrong. This product does not work with long hair at all. I tried adjusting and re-adjusting it, wearing my hair in different ways, nothing helped."
4,Wonderful for Transport,"My 6 year old daughter loves this item and it is so easy to take anywhere. She plays with it in the van, during her brother's soccer games and even during church (occasionally). The sound can be turned off and all the games can still be played easily. My daughter is 6 years old and spells at a 5th grade level. I'm not sure that this toy contributed to her spelling ability but it could have only been beneficial. The only negative that I have for this toy is that it takes 3 cell batteries and if your child plays with it as much as mine does this toy can become very expensive very fast. I am now considering the Expert Turbo Twister which takes AA batteries since I really don't want to spend another $10.00 to make the Mindmania operational again. I do recommend it but just be aware of the batteries."
2,Impressive Knowlege Base - but a little Lofty for the student,"I purchased this book for a graduate course in post-secondary education. The book is very well written and the authors obviously know their field. However, so far the book feels hurried. The authors only touch on complex ideals without explaining them. The theories of adult education are many and varied and need a more thourough description than these authors afford them. For the new student, this book leaves one feeling confused and rushed. As a student, I'm not very impressed with it's content."
2,A long-obsolete book,"Joe Christy was a prolific and competent aviation writer who wrote many short books for the G/L-TAB imprint as well as better publishers. This one is not poorly written or edited but it is an overview of suitable choices to power homebuilt aircraft circa 1977, its publication date. It is no longer current or useful, nor does it have historical value. Don't waste your money on it."
3,This is an overrated album,"This is one of the few live R.R. Kirk albums. The music is good, but not exceptional. The problem with the album is the narrative parts. Rashan spends about ten minutes of the album, which could have easily been placed on one CD, innanely rambling about his nose, clickity clack, and president Nixon. If it was on one CD, minus his ramblings, I might rate it four stars."
4,Terrific model,"Excellent model for the price with decent detail. You have to be good with an Xacto knife if you want to build the night fighter version. The cockpit detail is very good for a less than $20 build. If you want to spend a week having fun with a quick build, its an excellent product."
4,P38,"Interesting model that can be build into 3 different variants.This model's cast must have been used many times because some parts don't fit as tight as I would like to--need fillers at multiple joints.Need a lot of weights in the engine section because this modle is back heavy (I end up using a lot of metal nuts). If no weights, it will tip back wards.The model end up pretty heavy.Over all, it was a fun project with good details."
3,HOUSING CRISIS,A must see video on the current housing crisis. Become well informed on this crisis. Priced correctly and shipped in a timely matter.
5,It works,Some items in life are just what they are. This is one of them. It's heat shrink and it works. No complaints = great product.
5,Assorted Heat Shrink tubing in storage case,"This NTE Heat Shrink kit has just what you need, with a good assortment of diameters and pieces. This is the perfect kit for a do-it-yourselfer that has various project needs. If you need long lengths of specific diameters, purchase that separately."
4,It shrinks,I'm not sure of other shrink tubings resistance to solvents but this isn't doing bad on my rifles cleaning rod to protect the bore. Have even used on the wires it was intended for yet.
4,Good for the hobbyist,"Wide variety of colours, but the quantity is a bit low.I recomend purchase of separate measures separately, or for a hobbyist like me, this product is perfect."
5,Unusual Hideaways,I was really intrigued by this book after reading about it in the Orlando Sentinel. What you get is descriptions of offbeat homes or inns with stunning photographs. The author includes a ghost town in Colorado that was turned into a dude ranch. Read about Robert Redford's Sundance Resort or house formerly occupied by Georgia O-Keeffe and D.H. Lawrence.You can't even begin to imagine Kokopelli's Cave B&B; with the guesthouse carved into the face of a cliff overlooking a valley.
3,Meh.,It's okay but doesn't compare to theFender Frontman 10G 10-watt Guitar Practice Amplifierwhich is the same price.
5,Wonderful!,"The pictures are worth 1,000 words and then some. A wonderful gift for a child, of any age, especially someone who loves the beach. Highly recommended."
5,Imaginative. Brilliant. Fun.,"David Wiesner makes amazing children's books, and this story/art-series is my favorite! Flotsam takes the reader on the most incredible voyage, with different story-lines that will hold the interest of readers of all ages. There are no words, but the detailed pictures tell stories within stories. It starts with an inquisitive boy at the beach, and the most shocking part of the book, is that the young scientist brought his microscope with him! He builds a sand castle then a wave washes it away. But the tide leaves an old camera... and the adventure begins. The camera captures images of the inner workings of sea animals and the interesting side of ocean life that is hidden from human eyes. This book is creative, fantastical, and beautifully illustrated. If you don't love it, you might want to see a therapist."
5,Great textless book!,This is an excellent picture book about an adventure that everyone wants to go on. Delve deep into the sea and up beyond space to see worlds that you never knew existed... or did you?
3,Flotsam by David Wiesner,"Great book, but no words in it. I would have preferred words for my granddaughter to see along with the beautiful pictures. This is truly a picture book!"
3,Flotsam,"The book is very well illustrated. I purchased the book for my granddaughter's 4th birthday, who loves stories. There is no story written in the book, just pictures so see didn't like the book. It might work in a creative writing class but not for younger children."
2,Neat story idea but a few scary pictures for little kids,"I love the idea behind this story, a little boy finds a camera that washed up on the ocean shore and develops the pictures to see what goes on in the ocean. But there are a few pages with some pictures that would give my two year-old nightmares, so I returned this book right away. Disappointing."
2,Just Pictures,Did not realize that this book only contained pictures when I purchase it. Great pictures but my son looked through it once and has never picked it up again.
2,a glorified picture book; up to age 6 yrs.,I purchased this book for a 10 year old. He needs more than great pictures.
5,Wow! What isn't there to love about this book?,"This is truly an extraordinary book! I have 2 1/2 year old twins and thought the book, even though it's wordless, might be a bit too mature for them, but I was so wrong! We've only had it for 3 days and they want me to read it with them at least a couple of times a day. Every time we read it we discover something new. You really won't believe how much detail and imagination just pours out of this book. It's going to be my shower and baby gift from now on. I can't imagine any parent who wouldn't love to have this beautiful book in their child's library."
3,Two tales in one...,"While beautifully illustrated the narrative in this wordless story seems a bit disjointed; in fact, I see this is as two somewhat disconnected tales in one. A boy finds a fantastical camera which has pictures of a magical undersea world with mechanized fish, aliens cavorting with seahorses and starfish one hundred times bigger than whales. Beautifully and imaginatively illustrated, but with little emotion to draw in this reader. And then there's the surprising historical element of the camera, which did draw me into a story, but was entirely too brief. There's no denying that Wiesner is a very skilled artist, but I don't know if FLOTSAM was, indeed, the best of children's book illustration for 2006 (especially after seeing MOSES, illustrated by Kadir Nelson)..."
5,David Wiesner delivers again,"this time, Caldecott does uncover a find -- an engaging tale well told, with charming images swimming along."
2,Not great,Each time I used it I broke out in red whitehead-like pimples. I do still use it on my hands and body in the shower as it is a good exfoliator but will not order it again.
4,Murad is a sold product line,"Despite what some say, the product line is consistently good and delivers on it's promise. I wish I could use this exfoliator everyday because each time I use it, my skin glows."
2,Another disappointment...,"As a rather big fan of comics, especially X series... This is just another in a long line of disappointments. I have never found a Marvel game worth the $ you shell out for it. If you really must have this, wait a few months or find it used. I gave this 2 stars because the graphics are pretty nice, but thats where that ends. If you are a hardcore fan, then maybe this is for you but if not, just wait or go get something else."
5,"This game is cool,kind of like the movie X-Men 2","The story starts at the Institute for Gifted Youngsters. Wolverine(or Logan)is sleeping and he starts seeing images of the moment when he was created. The next morning,he tells Professor Xavier and Xavier tells him he has a time bomb that will release a deadly contagious virus in 48 hours. Now Wolverine has to go back to Canada and start his quest to find his creators and the antidote to the virus. Beast and Professor Xavier help Wolverine as he finds clues to his creators and the antidote. In this game you fight old and new enemies like Magneto,Sabertooth,Wendigo,and Juggernaut as you go deeper and deeper into Wolverine's past.This game is avaliable in all three consoles Playstation 2,Gamecube,and Xbox. Also in this game Wolverines claws are the size of a samuarai's sword. I give this game 5 stars for graphics,storyline,gameplay,action,fun,and characters."
5,"cool game, graphics, sound, characters etc.",this is the best game.The PC version is the best and more easy to play.This is an all star game.East or west X-MEN 2 Wolverines revenge is the best.
2,awful,"Worst game I have ever played on PS2. The graphics look like they came right from the sega genesis. Nothing groundbreaking, and not hing like the real character. A huge slap in the face to wolverine fans."
4,PUH-LEASE!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS BORING, WHEN YOU SEE THE COVER YOU THINK IS COOL AND EVERYTHING BUT, IS TOO BORING AND IT MAKES NO SENSE IF YOU WANT TO BUY ONE I DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO YOU, THE LEVELS ARE SOOOOOOOO HARD, AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE SOMETHING ABOUR X-MEN 2."
4,im a little dissappointed...but not too much,"well let me tell ya its great to be a mutant with claws and an exellerated healin factor and heightened senses but the people who made the game knew that it would be to easy to dispatch your enemies i mean a couple of punches with you claws bada bing good bye henchy so they made it hard.....very hard i mean dont get me wrong its sorta easy and fun...for a while but it kinda gets old and the graphics are a little bad,but if u even remotely like marvel comics,wolverine or the genre then you should buy now buy .ok let me brief you about the game you play as...wolverine DUH! you play you use a mixture of all your gifts to get the job done and it is fun to play i loved it after i got i got past it flaws or should i say claws? jk bbut realy youll love it bye,buy"
2,O MY GOD,This is the hardest game ever made. DO NOT BUY THIS. I want to break the game in half it is so frusterating. There are no savepoints in the middle of the game and it takes you about 20 hours to beat the third level. By my fourth time around trying to beat a level I gave up and haven't played it since.
4,You don't fight Omega Red even though he is released,"This game was pretty cool. Mark Hamill does the voice of Wolverine. Only a few other X-Men, Colosiss, Rouge, Professor X and Cyclopes. When you face Magneto he repeats the same lines over and over,also he is hard to find. Magneto and Omega Red have been released from a maximum security prison, and you as Wolverine must find and fight them. My only complaint is that Omega Red is not in the game other than being released. So they will make another one that will have Omega to fight. The graphics are cool and the game play is good. There are extra movies that are cool. I recomend this."
2,A Dissapointing Game,"I played this game, and soon I had concluded that this game was purely horrible. It seems like a game to look forward to when Spider-Man came out and it seemed fairly well. But Wolverine's Revenge is nothing like it, and is purely a dissapointing game. The gameplay is ok, but otherwise it seems like a really bad game. The graphics make the characters look horrible. Patrick Stewart is at least voicing Professer X's voice, which makes the sound pretty decent and the music is pretty good, but otherwise this game was one of the most dissapointing. The fighting isn't very good either, and the first boss battle against Sabretooth gets boring soon, because the battle is purely made out of jumping behind Sabretooth and grabbing him and throwing him into objects."
4,A Good Game - But Hard,"O.K. let's get started. Last week I rented X2 Wolverines Revenge for the PS2.I had saved up my allowance to buy any PS2 game I wanted. I wasn't too crazy about X-Men and Wolverine, but because it was a new game, I decided to check it out. well, at the end of the week my perpective changed about Wolverine and the X-Men. So, that weekend I went to buy the game. Well, when I was renting it, i thought ""Yeah, the gameplay is good, challenging, Graphics are O.K."" Those were the good things. The bad things were that IT IS HARD...So, I was forced to buy the strategy guide for it. Because of this, I have two points to make. One, is that Marvel should make games that are from 9 years old to- to-to 20 years old (at the most...So, now one week has passed, and I am on Act 3 (Part 3) Part1 (Level 1), including with the strategy guide. Overall, this game is great, but if you plan to beat it, get the strategy guide for it..."
2,"a failure to some, great to others","This game did not appeal to me very much at all. The combat system had a good concept, but was not executed the way I thought it would be. You hit an enemy and after a couple of slashes, he realizes he's hit. Stealth kills aren't all that either. The graphics on this game are horrible. When I saw screen shots of this game, it looked good, but as soon as I played it, looked like a Playstation 1 game. The control and camera was not terrible. It's somewhat ok and works for me. The story was probably the only good thing to ever come out of this game. Wolverine has a virus in him and has two days to find a cure or he dies!! Voice acting was GREAT for obvious reasons (you figure it out). But in the end this game was dumb. Only fans of the X-men comics, movies or whatever will like this game, and others will not.1-10Story - 8Graphics - 4Sound - 7Control - 5Entertainment - 5Replay Value - Moderately LowOverall - 5.5"
4,"3.5mm Tip & Ring both go to 1/4"" Tip","The cable itself looks pretty good and as I opened the molded ends up, the soldered connections also looked pretty solid.Nevertheless, in the conversion from the 3.5mm jack to the 1/4"" mono it seems the 3.5mm tip and ring both go the tip of the 1/4"". This unfortuately made it useless for the application I intended.I'm still giving it 4 stars because it looked pretty good and will probably work great for most folks' applications, but I thought that information might be helpful for a few."
3,works great,"got it today and works great with my guitar to my macbook, I can't wait to use it with ""garageband"""
4,Better than an adapter.,I always hear a hiss/click when I use a 1/8 cable and an adapter. It's just nicer to have a dedicated cable for CD input on my amp.
4,"Solid, thin wiring","As with all Hosa Cable products, they are great value as long as you don't stress them. Great for permanent installations, not-so-great for on-stage or frequently modified setups."
5,Works good,"It is just what it says it is and it works great. While it is not a beefy Monster cable I am still happy with the quality. Careful though, this one is Mono to Stereo. Make sure that is what you want."
3,Above Average,"The first time I tried this spice, it knocked my socks off upgrading the flavor of a bland pesto mozzarella pasta salad from an above average neighborhood supermarket in NYC. It is very salty if you over pour. Further, the ginger notes are hard to detect. This is my second bottle of Orange Ginger blend. In addition to a pesto mozzarella salads, I have used on homemade roasted root vegetables, homemade sauteed root vegetables, and homemade sauteed chick peas. I have not tried it on meat or fish. A friend of mine did and he enjoyed it on his fish although he did not rave about it. If I perfect a dish with it, hopefully I will remember to update this review."
1,Salt lick!,"We bought and returned this to Whole Foods for $5.49. This spice has very little flavor other than salt. We got it b/c it mentioned ginger and nutmeg, but we would have been much better off going to the spice section and just buying nutmeg and ginger b/c this turned our beautiful Bell and Evans chicken breast into salt sticks. I had to get Bulls Eye BBQ sauce just to attempt to damp down the salt lavor in this spice."
3,"Good reference, but............",Note to speakers of English who purchase this book to help learn Polish. There is _NO_ pronounciation in the Polish portion of this book.
1,hate it!,This doll and all the other Bratz dolls look like sluts. I can't believe we buy them for our little girls! My daughter got it as a gift and I returned it for a doll that doesn't look like she walks the streets.
1,I hate Bratz!,"I can't stand these dolls. I had one once, and it was terrible and sooo ugly! The clothes are hard to put on and off, the proportions are way off and their faces are disgustly ugly! Plus, what is with this ""Passion for Fashion!"" motto? Fashion is not really something to be passionate about. It is just clothes for goodness sake! And they kind of promote immodest clothing and other such things. Do little girls really need dolls with a bad name anyway? What is so great about these?!!!!!!!!!"
5,Dana dolls are the BEST!,"This Dana doll is so cute and sassy! I thought it wouldn't be fun , but I was wrong. Real wrong. Dana's cute outfits are great!!!I really love her pants. They really go with her skin tone. Plus at such a low price everybody can buy her! My Scene, Flavas ,and Barbie dolls are so out. I recomend you buy this doll!!!From,MichelleP.S, Buy all the Dana dolls, such as Formal Funk, Winter Wonderland, etc!!!!!"
2,Eh...,"The Male end fits loosely into some inputs while barely fitting tight in others. When it works... it works. However, getting it to do so is sometimes difficult as it takes some jiggling around.I'd say find another one..."
1,Disappointed Mom,"My son LOVES airplanes and jets! I bought this DVD based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video. If you want a DVD that shows airplanes/jets flying, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The name of the video should be, ""Watch the Blue Angles Get Ready to Fly,"" because that is what this video is. In the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying. Then the next 25 minutes is NO FLYING just talking and showing the Blue Angles getting ready for their show. In the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show. My son has never made it to that point. He wants to see airplanes/jets fly and I'm now on a new search for a DVD that will do this for him."
5,"A work of masterpiece, that ends in tradgety and hapiness","This book brings out emotions and feelings that many people do not know exist. Using clarity and refinement Weis & Hickman come together to make this book among the saddest but happiest books i've read. I read it in a day, I couldn't set it down. A must read for any DL fan"
5,It all comes to this,"After reading the cronicles then the first two books of the legends, I was on the edge of my seat for this one. This book did not let me down, it was great. Picking up from the end of ""The War of the Twins"" the start of the book leaves you with a lot of questions. It hardly makes since. After the first couple chapters you realize whats going on and from then on out its amazing. If you really are a true Dragonlance fan this book should not take you long. It took me five days to read it, and i don't really read that much. The end of this book will almost make you cry. (Its almost as bad as when sturm dies) All of the problems that the twins have come down to a final defining moment and what happens might not be what u expect. I gave this book a five out of five, and if anyone thinks different email me and ill have a debate with you."
5,Only book that made me cry.....WONDERFUL,"to bad 10 is the limit for rating this book, it should get 100+, this is the only book that has ever made me cry so profoundly that it was pretty pathetic, it's just such a great series overall, and the depth of character in the chronicles & legends are amazing, you really feel like the individuals in the series are your friends and your among them, this book is too great for words....there is nothing that quite compares"
5,This trilogy ended with one of the best books of the year!,"In this, the final installment of the DragonLance Legends, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman finished the story of the twins. They tell of Raistlin's journey through the Abyss, Caramon's knowledge of his brother's evil, and Tasselhoff's realization of life and it's tragedies. This book is an excellent example of perfect writing. As you read, you will be able to see yourself walking beside Raistlin, the sweet scent of rose petals and death in your nostrils. You may be trudging along beside Caramon in a life-less world, the mud sticking to you boots. Finally you could accompany Tanis and Dalamar, watching helplessly as Caramon enters the Abyss to deal with his brother, Raistlin"
5,the whole trilogy is great,This whole trilogy is awesome (Legends). The War of The Lance's culmination and Raistlin's rise to power (and fall) are portrayed exquistely. Characters like Lord Soth and of course Tasselhoff make it even better. :)
5,A great book,This is an excellent way to end the legends trilogy! Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman end the story of the twins with unexpected interest.
5,renault 12 tl,"disculpen el idioma pero tengo un renault 12 1982 ,en cd mexico necesito imagenes e informacion hacerca de este modelo gracias y saludos"
1,"Beware, not as pictured...","I ordered this because it A) came up in a search for ""cage nuts"" and B) because the picture shows a set of cage nuts, washers and screws.This product is just the screws. Lame."
3,"Not a bad show, but the DVD quality is poor","This was my first ever ROH DVD and it was a pretty good preview of how good ROH is. While some matches lagged, a few of them were quite good, especially the main event! Overall, I'd say 7/10.However, the quality of DVD is pretty poor. The poor lighting on this DVD (I think only with the Takedown Masters version) makes it a bit hard to see, and there is alot of clipping, so that one moment the wretslers are outside of the ring on the floor, the next moment they are in the ring giving chops to each other. And many portions of the show were not even featured on this DVD, including an entire match! I recommend this DVD but if you get it, make sure to get it from ROHwrestling.com"
4,Nice intro to an eccentric genius,"Kirk was one of the most unique and talented jazz musicians of the 60s and 70s, a real innovator who is sometimes unjustly passed off as a novelty act because he would play two or three instruments at once. This compilation serves as a great introduction for those who don't know his music. Although the selections are not chronological, the set does hold together very well and does a great job demonstrating the breadth of his talent and his ability to incorporate a number of different styles into his music. I would still recommend picking up the full albums (start with ""We Free Kings""), but those who are looking for a nice compilation to sum up the man's prime years should give this a try."
4,Excellent,"I may be biased with this review, but I'll try and keep it simple. If you in any way like Porcupine Tree, Post-rock, Ambient-rock, Anathema etc etc, then please do yourself a favour and buy this CD. The guitar work, as mentioned elsewhere, is outstanding. My girlfriend actually thought she was listening to a Steven Wilson project; the playing, song-writing and production is that good. Go get it folks."
4,Awesome!!!,"If you like Porcupine Tree, OSI, Rush, Riverside, Dream Theater or other such musical greats then you will love Abigail's Ghost. What a great debut! AG are true musicians and display their talents well, there are plenty of examples throughout the cd. You will hear a range of musical styles from heavy metal prog to acoustic ballads including phenomenal atmospheric layers. There is a lot going on in each song...My only wish is that there was a little more clarity of instruments, especially voice and keyboard. In places they seem to be muddled in the extreme background. Some guitar solos were also not well defined.Overall a great release, definately one of my new favortie bands! I look forward to AG's next release!"
4,love sounds good,"Brought this CD back to the cottage some time ago. Me love it! Especially love sounds - kinda spooky & static-e. Most songs have their high points - the first song makes me want to order a pizza, which is good, except there's no pizza delivery where I live. Guitar work is very good, but elves wonder why drummer sometimes adds random beats to songs. Me don't know the answer to that, but I do know that this is a good stocking stuffer."
3,Security,"I bought this book for an online course I am taking, and for the most part it's okay. If you are into those type of manuals you would probably get a lot out of it. The writing is more interesting then the regular instruction manuals for this line of schooling."
2,Much better books available,"I started using this book to study for the CompTIA Security exam, and it seemed to cover the topics necessary to pass. However, most parts only gloss over the details, and there are some rather poor examples that complicate rather than help explain some topics. If you can memorize the book, this might help someone pass. But if you need to know the why and how of security, get a book that has hard examples and more details than this one."
4,:),"A woman related to Dr. James Jaleski, the director of the Project Crescent cloning project, shows up in Amy's life claiming to be her biological mother - according to her, Amy was not one of the thirteen clones after all, but rather, the ""blueprint"" for the thirteen - the original! She claims that Amy is really Laura Jaleski. Tasha does some Internet research and discovers that Laura actually has a birth certificate! Amy then decides that she is going back to her biological mother and leaves Nancy Candler. Is her choice the right one? --This was one of the best books in the series. I loved how it dealt with Dr. Jaleski's family a little bit more."
3,"GOOD, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","Like I said in the title of this review, it was good, but Kaye could have done a much better job in this installation of the series. It was good enough to keep me interested all the way to the ending, but that was it. The ending was a total flop. It was just like the ending to the book I'M NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM by Peg Kehret. I thought that Camilla was from the organization and trying to kidnap Amy. When I read the preview of this book in the back of number seven, I had different, and better expectations of the book. Not too bad, but not the best either."
5,"LOL, when I get a human....","I have not cut anyone hair yet with these trimmer other than my mannikin. ""HE""...mannikin looks good. Upon creating (anything) on at least 5 people I will return (hopefully) to give my official opinion for this blade trimmer. Wish me luck. LOL"
3,great gate - LOUSY hardware,"I have read alot of the reviews here and the problem with the gate is neither the installation nor the gate itself. The problem with the gate is the hardware. the extra wide, and therefore, extra heavy gate attaches to the wall on each side with metal screws. these screws are held in place by plastic. for the most part this is fine until an accident occurs, which is when you want to gate to work the best. unfortunately, the plastic holding the gate onto the wall broke, not the screws, and not the metal gate itself, but the plastic mounting hardware. the fix to this is simple, get rid of the plastic and use brass or stainless steel. at the very least, make the replacement parts available on-line through the company's web site. If I am paying 60, 70 or more dollars for a gate, I would pay an extra five for better hardware. fortunately, when the gate came down, with my wife, she suffered a bruised ego and some black and blue marks, but it could have been much more serious."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM ! ! !,"The engineer/designer for this product should be given a demotion at their next performance review. What a great way to ensure your company gets a reputation for putting out crappy products. After I installed the gate, I was counting the days the plastic components would start breaking. Sure enough, it took 11 days of light use and the plastic hinge cracked and flew in all directions. Employing plastic hinges for heavy metal gate runs contrary to most manufacturers' intuition, but not this one. Until they start using better materials, my strict recommendation on this product would be to take a pass. If this on-line rating system allowed a score less than ""1"", I would give it."
1,Worked for a while...,"The gate worked well for about 3 months. Soon after we installed the gate, we noticed that the gate began to sag due to its own weight. We were unable to close the gate by swinging it shut. Instead, we had to lift it into the lock mechanism because it was sagging. Even after some adjustments, the gate would continue to sag. Finally, the weight of the metal gate finally got to the plastic hardware and the plastic hardware snapped off the wall (with metal screws still in the wall). Maybe it would have lasted longer if we did not put it in a high traffic area? Now we are looking for a shorter swinging gate with add on panels that remain stationary, with metal (rather than plastic) hardware. Hopefully, the weight of the shorter gate will keep it standing."
1,Not even worth one star!,This is the worst gate out there! I called customer service three times and relayed my difficulty. NOTHING should be this hard. Both of the gates I purchased were malformed. UGH!
1,Hinge Broke off clean,"My spouse wanted this gate to block off the kitchen which totaled 71 inches. The gate worked for about two weekS when the plastic hinge broke off (UNUSABLE AT THIS POINT) clean. If anyone wants to use this product find a better hinge and mount 2X4's to the wall, otherwise find another gate."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!! Very Unsafe!!!!,"The first time this gate came out of the hinges, it landed on one of my twins head. He had a large bruise from his forehead to his jaw. The second time, he had a gash in his upper gums and was bleeding profusely! There is a serious flaw in the hinges of this gate. After the first time, I contacted their customer service through email. A CS rep emailed me back a few times (Maddy Stephens) but when it came to getting replacement hardware the emails stopped. (By the way, this gate came with the NEW metal hardware they made to replace the ""defective"" plastic ones they used to use!) The second time my child was injured, I called. I was on the phone for appr. 10 minutes before the CSR offered an apology. She did, however, offer to send a new gate ""as soon as possible!"" 6 days later..I dont have a replacement gate and it just fell on my other twin. Luckily, there was no blood or bruises this time!Please don't waste your money on this gate. Mine is going in the trash today!"
2,unhappy mom,i bought the sure and secure gate and like the others it served its purpose till my son started walking. he would hang on it and try to shut it (would slam it shut) then the hinges broke. we called and got new ones and we put metal long screws in it and it broke again. it actually broke off the wall. i am very dissatisified.
3,unhappy mommy,i was very pleased with the first few months of use we got out of this gate until like the others the plastic hardware that holds the gate up broke...i am very upset that i paid good money for a so called safety gate...it is not safe anymore.
3,"Same problem--great gate, LOUSY hardware.","We had the same problem with ours. The plastic hardware broke, making the gate unsafe (i.e. useless). Otherwise it's a great gate."
1,Metal Weld Failed,"A 4 year old girl (somewhat petit since she is the same size as my 3 year old) who was visiting our house yesterday pulled on the gate. The gate's metal FAILED at the spot weld to the metal cap where the bolt screws in. The gate, which was fortunately protecting an area at the bottom of our spiral stairs came down on top of the girl and came out of the wall. This is not the gate you want."
1,Don't buy this gate!,"I bought this gate because it was the only one babie's r us carried in the store that was 60 inches wide. By the second day the bolts were coming out of the wall. We installed larger bolts which worked fine. But last night, after having the gate up for a month, the plastic hinge broke. So my apt's walls are ruined and I have a worthless metal stepladder. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
1,PLASTIC HINGES PIECE OF JUNK,It took two weeks of lite use for the plastic hinge to crack and let the gate fall and put a huge scatch on my wall. Now it is totally worthless. I will have to go find something else plus patch the holes in the walls from the screws and the scratch. RECOMMEND DON'T BUY.
2,this gate sucks,"We had this gate for 1 year before it just recently broke. We knew it wasn't the best, but there are VERY few gates to cover 70 in. The anchors it came with were plastic, so my husband used anchors rated for over 100 pounds so the weight of the gate wouldn't pull out of the wall. That wasn't what broke. The chinsy little plastic mechanism it swings on is what broke. Also, the gate does not contract within itself when you open it, so it takes alot of space to clear in the room. The closing latch starting sticking several months ago. We put off replacing the gate because there are so few options for that large of a doorway."
1,Terrible Gate!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this gate. We needed a gate to fit a 57"" opening, and this gate was reasonabley priced and looked okay. Well, no wonder it was reasonably priced, it is total junk. It is so heavy that after having it installed for less than 12 hours it pulled out of the wall. We used anchors and it just ripped right out. It is also very hard to open and close. This gate was horrible, I returned it to the store and got the Configure Gate, and at $80 more than the Suree and Secure, it was worth every penny!"
5,Don't listen to these people,"I see a lot of reviews and hear a lot of people say that Playstation 2 is no better than Dreamcast. Don't get me wrong, I have a Dreamcast and I love it, but the graphics of the PS2 are better. If you don't believe me, go and download an MPEG of Final Fantasy X and compare it with a Dreamcast game."
5,....,"PS2 is the best gaming system ever!! The graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. I have had this for a few months, and I have never spent so much time in front of my TV. The games I have are: ATV offroad fury, Triple Play Baseball, Madden 2001, Crazy Taxi, Coolboarders 2001, and NHL 2001. I suggest you get all of those games except Triple Play (its too easy. You also need a memory card, and a dvd remote, that helps a lot. .... If you like video games, you have to buy this!"
2,Is PS 2 really that good?,I have a Sega Dreamcast and i love it. Then came Sony Playstation 2. I wanted PS 2. I got it and i do not like it. I play my dreamcast all the time. The games for PS 2 are good but ths console it self stinks.
1,LOOK around befor you buy,Don't buy a ps2 just becuse it's style How can you know it's the best if you are one way minded what about dreamcast gamecub xbox Is dreamcast dead hard to say when sonic aventrue 2 come out sega can't make enough of it it's so good
3,not worth the price,"This system is just great, but over-priced. Lucky me I got some relatives with alot of money so they bought me this for my B-day. This product is good, but not good enough that I'll pay 400 dollars for it. With the money you save on not-buying this, you can get alot of great PC games, and a game-pad with a motion-sensor for your computer. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy the PS2, I'm just saying that a couple of good computer games and a good game-pad (with a motion sensor of course) are better. Also you can buy a great new graphics card for your computer so your games will look even better than the PS2 games. Other than that, it's a great system, but could be cheaper."
3,The over-rated system is not so great,"The over-rated system looks good on the outside, but in the in-side it's a differnt story. Sony clams many things about the system. They say that it has a Dvd drive, but it's super slow. Like at x4. If you have friends over only 2 can play at a time, plus there the same coll. has playstation one. Dreamcast has better graphics, but playstation two has faster frames. Sony did have a good idea about making it so you playstation one games.Now to go in-depth, the systems is alot faster than playstation one. Sony clams that the system can do you to 66 million polygons per second. The games do 3-6 million polygons per sec. at it's best. The speed rather slow at 294.912 mhz with a 147.456 system buz. It goes on and on. It never comes up to Gamecube and X-box.The overview is don't waste your money. It's ... (like a half of a computer) and it's impossable to get it. Buy dreamcast or your save money."
1,Worst system ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Thanks to sony playstation 2,now Sega Dreamcast is going out of buissnes! Playstation 2 games are like old re-runs from playstation!!Dreamcast has better graphics than playstation 2.You could buy a Dreamcast and a DVD player for less than the price a Playstation 2.WARNING DON'T BUY!!!!!!!"
1,Playstation who?,Hi I unfortunatly have a psx2 and well to put it words its .... Since i brought my psx2 i have purchased a Dreamcast and the games and price of the dreamcast kick the playstation 2's .... I have 10 games on my Dreamcast and 7 on my psx2 including Teken tag and ridge racer. i have Dead or Alive 2 on both formats but the Dreamcast one grapically is slightly better. the only good thing on the psx2 which i like is the abillity to play DVD but a built in toaster don't make it play games any better! but even thats a bit shoddy. i like the psx2 but comparing it to the dreamcast its a little ... personally i would wait fot the X-Box!I am 23
1,"Overhyped, overpriced","Yes, Playstation 2 definately has some great games but the Dreamcast has the exact same games with the same level of detail at a much lower price.For now I'd stick with my dreamcast and a fast computer system."
1,Dissapointment...,"This console is really expensive and has a lot of problems like freezing up, jammed CD trays, refusing to play any games on occasions, and it only has 2 controller ports with no online games, in the end it has minimal multiplayer support and a lackluster game library, I am really dissapointed."
1,A sad time for real! video gamers,"If you are really interested in video gaming I beg you to read thison...it is so sad, that good marketing got much more important thangood Gaming. If you read this, don't judge me as a reality-blind Segafreak. I don't care who manufactures my Games, I care how good theyare. I have a Sega Dreamcast and some friends of mine got aPlaystation2. As a viedeogames enthusiast I wonder what the hype isall about! PS2 is not a revolution, not a sensation... it is somethingsimilar to Dreamcast. This fall I'll probably buy a Nintendo or aMicrosoft console, but who cares? I will buy the better System (withthe better games!). It is not important who made it or how many TVspots there are on the screen. Please...take a look and their greatstory and probably even Sony freaks will understand me."
2,Don't waste money on hype,"I have been playing games since the Atari 2600 days and know a whole lot about the subject. The Playstation 2 WILL be good. As of right now it is not worth the aggravation of getting one due to its lack of software. The REAL system to get is the Dreamcast. I have always been very open minded when it comes to videogames and own every one. The Sega Dreamcast is cheaper and has games for everyone. There is even a company working on putting a software on the market so you can play Playstation 1 games on the Dreamcast! So am I going to buy a PS2? Yes I am, but for now I'll be playing the system that has the best games on the planet right now, Dreamcast."
2,Its Ok BUT.................,Playstation2 is all right it has some good stuff like the ssx game.But then again the dvd is very unnecessary it has no need to be in there for starters also Sony should make a separate dvd model give you the option of putting one in there. I think they should have worried about there games more then the dvd player. Madden is the worst football game I have played in a while. The controls are very hard to get use to and madden him self does a horrible job on this game just says mainly bam or that's an all madden play. I was to go buy another playstation2 I would not I would save my money for something else.
3,Don't even waste your time!,Don't even waste your time with the Ps2. I finally got one about a month ago and was very dissapointed. These games aren't anything new. NFl2k for dreamcast was way better then madden. Madden is to slow and not fun to play. I got to admit though the graphics on Nhl are good but not great. All Sony did was copy what Dreamcast already had. Don't even try to get one. Anyone who bought one should have Sony apologize to them for the biggest hype there is. Just Wait and See. Thanks
5,Like a slowly-opening rose,"This was my introduction to Billie, nearly ten years ago. Although I haven't purchased any more of her music since, I'm keeping this album forever. Funny that the reviewer below said to play it during a hot summer afternoon; my experience is playing it soft and low on a chilly romantic evening. Either way, what a stunning selection of songs -- and Billie handles them so well! She doesn't have the most technically perfect voice, but damn...such genuine emotion, it's like the song, the person, and the emotion have melded into one. Every time I listen, there are more and more details and lyrics that I missed before...and once-favorite songs get supplanted by new ones all the time. This is a wonderful place to start, though I'm sure that you could start with any of the albums in this series and begin a life-long love affair with Billie just as easily."
4,Must read,"I find this novel astounding, a must read for everyone interested in the vibrant world of trans-Pacific writing. It is a novel about four very different characters caught up in the urgency and terror of negotiating personal space in the years leading up to Hong Kong's return to China in 1997. Avoiding the narcissism of expats and the demeaning perspective of Orientalism, Xu Xi writes as a true native."
2,Not for 10 and uo!!,"Helped my son build this model and even I had some difficulty with it. The instructions can be very vague, the parts don't always fit well, and some parts are very fragile. should be skill level 3 at least. Just remember better quality from Revell."
1,Don't bother,"I was very excited to add this device to my collection, as I have several lovely bundt pans and do a lot of baking. However, the ""tunnel of bundt"" is awkward to use, and even with the pan filled just halfway with batter the baking cake overflowed INTO the device and I ended up having to cut the batter out of it when it was finished baking.It would be much easier to simply cut a tunnel out of the baked cake and not trouble with this cumbersome thing. Alton Brown is right: don't bother with unitaskers!"
2,"Careful, it is (or was) a moving target","Persons giving this product good reviews seem to be using it for recording and video, but I wanted it primarily to play back audio (mp3 and FLAC). It is advertised as capable of this, but I had very little luck with it in that capacity. With high bit rate mp3, it got 1 minute or so into the music and stopped or stuttered. At typical bit rates it would run 5 minutes or so before messing up. I had no luck whatsoever with FLAC. It cannot do what a cheap portable MP3 player can do.Some on the Neuros Inc Forum have suggested that the problem is that the developers took a big leap in a recent firmware upgrade and that the result was not successful. Since that time, all the development talent seems to have migrated to the OSD2. So the OSD was a moving target. But I think it recently took one step forward and two back, and won't be moving much anymore."
1,Slow/Unresponsive,"I went with a self-contained solution because I wanted something that ""just worked"" and didn't need hours of setup. I ended up returning the device, because it was frequently slow and occasionally unresponsive.I'm going to go with a MythTV instead."
4,Very Cool!,"Very easy to configure and use. The only drawback (not much of one either) is that the processor in the unit seems a bit under powered. When switching between certain functions with the remote, it can hang for a second or two making you think the remote isn't working. I have numerous DVRs from Tivos to a MythTV box. I've seen this same slow response in Tivos so it's not a big deal. I was amazed that it just worked on all of my different movie formats from AVI to MP4. Also works well with my network hosted mp3s and jpg digital pictures. Well worth it!"
3,"Excellent idea, not that stable yet, some quality issues","I tried this product, because I've tried the D-Link, Netgear and Hauppauge (spelling?) media player products, and really haven't liked any of them. This one is nice and small, but I'd rather have a plain rectangular, box shape personally. Setup was a breeze. Unfortunately, the playback of movies has been less than desired. I have this unit hooked up to my local switch, where my file server is also connected. I use WinTV to record tv shows, and save them to the file server. The OSD has a hard time playing them. Sometimes, it can't play them at all, other times it does play, but the video and audio is so choppy, you can't watch it. I think the firmware is young, and is going through lots of changes, so I'm going to stick with it for a bit. Also, there is no built in wifi support yet, but they say it is coming."
2,"Great potential, but do your research","The OSD does what it says - it can record videos and then play back it's recordings. There are definite limitations to doing anything beyond that. If you are looking to stream video from other sources (like your computer), look at other options like some of the Media Extenders that are out there. For basic recording, a Tivo may be a better option than the OSD. Redeeming qualities - it should get better, given the open source nature of the project. Do your research and think about why you want one of these before you buy it."
2,Very Disapponted!,"I purchased the OSD after my Neuros Recorder 2 stopped working. I had the same problems with both OSDs. I'm getting ready to send back the 2nd one soon. There was a vertical line going from the top of the picture to the bottom that ran across the screen from left to right. It that shows on the recording. My Recorder 2 had this problem too, but you could tweak the input cable to get the line to disappear. No such luck with the OSD. I tried to play an MPEG on the OSD from both an SD card and a USB thumb drive. On both OSDs I got sound, but a black screen on play back.I had high hopes for the OSD. I was very excited about the ability to play back MPEGs! The Recorder 2 can not do that. Alas, it seems I have to wait until the product matures."
2,Poor network performance,"I wanted to love this device. It's open-source, it plays everything, and it even sports some sharp design. Under the hood, however, it's simply not that powerful.Although the unit detected and connected itself to the network easily, streaming playback was simply unacceptable. The video never stuttered, but that apparently came at the expense of keeping the audio in sync.Standard-def AVIs would go in and out of sync at random. HDTV-quality recordings would get progressively worse, until the audio was de-synced by several full seconds. Testing the network connection with a laptop showed no problems - full 100Mbps speed. Upgrading the OSD firmware - a pleasantly simple task - made no difference.Streaming content from your home network is one of the advertised features of the OSD, so I don't feel I was asking anything above and beyond. I wanted a small, effective set-top box to stream media, but the OSD simply didn't deliver."
5,Best and most flexible media player... Helps to know your linux!!!,"Fantastic product! So good I have 3 of them hooked on my network with NFS to share 2TB worth of movies and video podcasts. Very flexible and expandable but it does help if you know your way around the terminal and can do simple BASH scripting.Also using many linux ""rippers"" like mencoder/acidrip with lavc will tag the movie as FMP4 and wont play on these.... All you need to do is copy and change the fourcc to XVID,DIVX,or DV50 like so...mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -ffourcc DV50 wrongfmp4.avi -o rightdivx5.aviIt wont take long.... Make sure to add this in your mencoder options so you don't need to do this every time (This is just a fix if you already have a ripped collection to play and didn't know....)"
4,"Great, neat product.",This product is great. I hooked it up and was able to save some old family VHS tapes.
2,Neuros has dropped this ball,"I think this DVR might have potential, but the manufacturer has pretty much stopped supporting it. I bought it based on the idea that the open source software could be upgraded and was hoping to download and use software that other people wrote. Instead, it seems like everyone at Neuros is focused on their other product, the Link. Either that or they are just out to lunch completely.The remote is clumsy to use, the buttons are hard to push and it makes navigating the menus an exercise in frustration. Also, my IR blaster (the little plastic component that changes the channel on the cable box for scheduled recordings) has failed. Not a huge deal, except that it is pretty much impossible to get a hold of someone at the company and buy a new one. Their phone number goes straight to voicemail, and all email to their support just falls into a black hole. I would not buy this product again--if anything goes wrong you're hosed."
4,Neros OSD,"Particularly useful, generally easy to use. Looking forward to Linex share upgrades and utilities"
1,over promises and under delivers,"looked like a good product, interesting idea, good extension option for a media center environment or for ripping dvds - just didnt do it for me really though - pain in the a$$ to set up, no real documentation, no hdmi connection, no usb connection?, lots of old school rca cables - felt like i was highjacking a flea market device - still willing to try other products from this company as this device is still pretty innovative and great concept - next time neuros"
1,Horrible DO NOT BUY THIS PLEASE,"Big on promises, none delivered. The most use part of this product is the cardboard box that can be used to ship it back. I am very tech capable and I knowledgeable. The USB port is useless. NO USB drives will work on this thing so you can only record on SD cards which aren't big enough to record on the best setting, but if you get a bigger SDHC card you have to use an adapter which goes into the useless USB port. See the constant circle of frustration. All storage has to be formatted with FAT32 but even if you do, it still wont work. It will hang up and stop recording constantly and in only 2 days of ownership has locked up and frozen 5 times. Please do not buy this, tell everyone. Save your money and buy the DVDs this thing is a waste of time, money, patience, sanity, USB drives, space, air, chips, plastic and cardboard. Oh but the batteries for the remote were the only things that worked."
1,Useless,The product connects well to the TV and has a nice screen. Much better than Western Digital's hard to read blue. But it will not read or acknowledge my media.
1,Promises not delivered,"First, this product is for the uber-geek not for the common user, I can't recommend this to anyone but the geekest of my friends and now, not even them. Why? neuros never finished this product, it has several bugs that make it unusable for anything but to record tv at a certain resolution. That's it. Not even try anything else."
2,Deservedly out-of-print,"I kept reading rave reviews about this book (on other sites) and finally decided to buy it--ugh! I can't believe I searched and searched for a copy and was thrilled when I found one. I'm of an age to remember all of the Yucky women's magazines of the 60's--this novel reads like some of the short stories I remember all too well in those. It's written in sentimentally lurid, gushing, florid prose. I think the scenario is quite clever, but couldn't get past the style to appreciate it fully."
2,Over-rated!,"I bought this book on the recommendation of another ... reviewer--a mistake. This is NOT a great book; it's OK--it's actually a bit strange in places (so fictionalized as to be unrecognizable). The idea is a clever one: create 4 non-historical characters who knew Richard and present their point of view of him, but so much other ""stuff"" about these 4 unbelievable non-historical characters intrudes that you feel bereft: Richard is almost always in the background, filtered through the stories of people you'll find it hard to care about. The style is flamboyant and cloying at times (and ""feels"" old-fashioned). It's also not terribly accurate historically (although it never claims to be anything but fiction--yet one yearns for a bit more reality and a bit less fiction!). Even if you're a die-hard R3 fan, you might want to pass on this one. Read (or re-read) Sharon Penman's ""The Sunne in Splendour"" instead!!!"
4,Ted still rocks,"I'm almost 62 years young and still enjoy my rock music. Ted only enforced this with his great music and fond memories with songs like ""Stranglehold"". Live long and rock on!"
2,"may be good, but not for what i needed","I thought i could use this to output from my guitar amp to the microphone jack of my laptop to record, but it didn't work. There was no signal. This is my fault, not the cable's, but i thought I'd mention this so anyone thinking the same thing as me would be forewarned."
2,Review with no title,"This review was based on the 2000 version, the newest one, of the College Chemistry. After studying this as a guildline to the subject of Chemistry, I found out that this book had very good and short explanations of all the important concepts. However, this study guild's value had been destoried because the amount of misprints and errors in the example problems. This book seemed to be rushed to meet the 2000 year time. Therefore,the mistakes in it was overlooked. To learn concepts, the book is a very good aid, however to look at the examples, it is very poor and sad to see those simple mistakes."
3,brush,might be better for bunnies but it did not brush out my guinea pigs like i thought it would. i got a flea comb instead
3,Slicker Brush,"I got this brush for my two guinea pigs. As the last reviewer said, it does not catch all of the loose hair/fur. The whole reason that I purchased this was so that it would grab all of my piggies' loose fur so that they would shed less. It did not accomplish the job. I think that the bristles are just too far apart to do the job. The product itself is free of defects and seems to be of decent quality materials."
3,Should've retail shopped first....,"Nothing is wrong with this product, except my bunny has super fine fur, and I take more off by rubbing her back than this brush does, but the ones with the teeny bristles and no comfort on the ends would have hurt her. Still not a bad brush, just maybe need something with shorter bristles."
2,Okay-ish,"This brush would only work if you have an extremely fat hairy rodent. I tried it on my Holland lop rabbit during shedding season and it doesn't work, the bristles are too far apart and it doesn't even pull any hair out. Wouldn't even work on a cat. Not quite worth the money."
4,Self descovery and individualism in communist China,"An intriguing story of self-discovery, sexuality, and individualism unfolds in communist China with the 1989 incident in Tiananmen Square as a backdrop. Using emotion to describe an artists conflict between freedom/expression to a control exerting government, Ying Hong highlights human determination and spirit in the face of adversity. This is a wonderful and exciting book, and one I found difficult to put down."
2,I didn't really see the point of this story,"I didn't really understand this novel. It begins with a dramatic description of a young woman's escape from Tiananmen Square on June 4th, which is dramatic, but then it degenerates into a (tedious) meditation on women and sex. If there was some kind of parallel drawn between the momentous political events and this woman's personal protest against repression, it would be better. But it is too disjointed and never brings the two together. Skip it unless you can get it cheap. Only takes a couple of hours to read."
1,Summer of Betrayal review,The idea and promise of this book are intriguing but the book is a huge disappointment. The writing is disjoined. The focus of the story seems mis-placed with emphasis on portions of this characters experience that detract from readers ability to find the main character compelling. While the book has a strong beginning - it quickly loses itself in over-blown descriptions of situations and characters that are unimportant to the development of the main character. I don't recommend this book.
1,A generic book,"This book does not focus on the June 4th incident, but rather a woman's jouney through the Chinese underground. In both respects, it fails miserably. Chinese writers should not try to emulate an established American form (the novel is a mixture of harlequin romance and feminist melodrama), but instead venture to new territories. This book is both pretentious and treacerously unoriginal. If you're looking for a good Chinese fiction, skip performance artists like Amy Tan and Hong Ying, and read the short stories of Ha Jin or the novels of Gish Jen."
1,Not for intelligent readers,"How do I describe this book? Let me try. First of all: it's bad. The style is rudimentary and unaccomplished. Second, it's shallow. Makes a very very very great effort to tell us how BAD it is to live in an awful country where you just can't be a poet or express who you are - but don't worry, an orgy on the floor of an enlightened youth's house will give the poor confused heroine the freedom she was so desperately looking for. Doesn't look exactly like freedom of the mind, though. The problem with this sort of cheap political pamphleteering unsuccessfully disguised as a novel, is that for some reason it gets lots of undeserved praise (one suspects that some readers and critics are more interested in thrashing a political regime they don't agree with, than in judging whether the book is good or bad), thus obscuring other books which are much better written but, alas, much less sensationalist. My advice? DON'T BUY IT, UNLESS FOR AN ENEMY."
5,Interesting Look Back,"This book is more a fascinating artifact than a usable cookbook for today, but it is quite fascinating. It's a facsimile reprint of the 1890 edition, and gives a look back into English society of the late 1800s. The type is small, but is readable. It has LOTS of pictures, i.e. a whole page of cakes, or meats, or cooking utensils. A lot of attention is paid to presentation of the meal, with molded desserts, platters of fish, instructions on how to fold napkins into fans or palm leaves, etc. It also gives cooking times for every type of meat imaginable... but how useful that is for today is debatable, as it assumes ""good average fires"". This book is worth a look if you're into history as well as cooking."
2,Hard on the eyes !,The fact that it is a typo reproduction of the original needs to be highlighted.The type is miniscule - hardly usable.
1,Should have gotten the kindle edition,1) the type is tiny in this book and I have 20/20 vision.2) the printing is crud3) get the free kindle edition and save your money
4,Close..,"I bought this blower motor for my 2004 Dakota. Now, though it said it did fit, it didn't. But, after looking the motor over, I was able to dismount the motor assembly from the ""Neon"" housing and transfer it over the ""Dakota"" housing. Wasn't much touble at all. Just wish it had been noted in the product. Other than, that, Perfect. It works amazingly in my Dakota. Saved me A LOT of money over the ""Factory"" replacment at 138.00. Thanks for this item."
2,home video,"I bought this on the strength of some of the other reviews and ended up wondering what they were talking about. My review is based on the first ten minutes of the movie because I, my wife, and my two little girls who love horses and horse movies, couldnt stand to watch any longer. It really gave the impression of a poorly edited amateur movie - long, everyday scenes with no evident scripted action and little editing. We watch a lot of Hollywood but also independent film-makers and this was just very, very disappointing to my whole family."
3,horse documentary,I bought this for my grandaughter. She liked it but then again she loves horses. I didnt care for it. There is no real story and it tell all about horses. Its like a documentary. If youre looking for a good story this is not the book for you.
2,More for the 5+ crowd,"It's difficult for my toddler to appreciate this video. The sheer size and complex mechanics of the machines featured in this video are fascinating to adults and older children. But not enough action and variety for those under 5. The same song is repeated throughout the video; variety of songs would have been better. Not bad, but not one of our favorites."
4,Nanny's camp,"My 2 year old grandson, who loves horses, requests this dvd every time he spends the day with me. He especially enjoys the first part that shows the horse going to the vets, getting shoes put on him, being bathed and groomed, and the first competition. He loses a little interest when there is more than one horse event, but still requests it the next time he comes to visit! He also likes that the movie is told by the horse's perspective. When I ordered this dvd I was afraid that the narration would be in an Irish brogue, but was pleased that it was not so that it would be easier to understand."
3,Big disappointment,"Thought the book content would be a great Christmas gift for my niece as she loves to write and journal; however, when I opened the package, I found the thick vinyl/plastic cover warped and wavy. Big disappointment."
4,"Like it, but Missing Stickers!","My daughter is a 5th grader, and she really likes the book. We just wish the book has more pages (or an option to add pages) as she has many friends. The book cover said it comes with stickers, but we don't see any stickers! Other than that, we are happy with this book."
5,:-),"I LOVE this book! it's great for girls ages 8-18. Although I love it, my friends aren't too crazy about it and don't really care. But if you have A LOT of friends then this is the book for you!"
5,Praise for CD,"I love prog (classic prog, that is), and that is why I loved this CD.While searching for maybe Kansas, Spock's Beard, or Proto-Kaw,Amazon suggested some CD's I'd never heard of--Cryptic Visionwas one of them. I took a chance and now have purchased severalof their recordings.Wow, several of the songs on this CD are, alone, worth the price ofthe recording. I read that some had criticized the reviews claimingthey were written by band members. First, who cares! If the musicis as good as this I'm glad it is praised (I don't care who is doingthe praising). Second, any objective prog lover will like this.I just hope Cryptic Vision is still making music.The vocal and harmonies were superb. The musicianship was steller.There is literally nothing to criticize. Great recording!DrWatson"
4,Good Item!,Hosa makes a quality product and these are no exception. Not much really to say except they work as they should. The only better product like this is made by Mogami but is much higher priced.
1,It should be 0 star,"You plug it in, ok! When you plug out the second or the third one, it's broke to many parts. I have to open my electric guitar to take the broken part out."
5,great little plugs,"I ordered a dozen or so of these, they are great to have in anyone's home studio or for stage musicians"
3,"Shipped wrong quantity - 0.25"" phone-phono adapter","Quality is OK for the price - however, I ordered 3 packs from this supplier and received only 2. The supplier was non-responsive about this error."
1,"Cheap and dont fit normal 1/4"" inputs",The title says it all...these are cheap and dont fit normal quarter inch inputs without excessive (damaging to device) force....stay away from these
5,Happy,"Happy with this purchase, it works and go it for a great price, purchased this item to record from my keyboard to my laptop, and it works perfectly."
3,make sure you look further than this!,"if you are ""academically"" interested then this book is pretty good stuff, but if ""someone you know"" is considering the application of any of its content then you/they should be aware that a lot of fester's stuff (although i'm not positive on this one specifically) has been criticized, and in a few specific cases picked to pieces in places like alt.drugs.chemistry on usenet - for it's accuracy and the value of the actual application of some of his instructions. It'd be worth doing some search engine research to see where people have challenged his advice as sometimes misleading and occasionally dangerous."
4,"Good food for thought, but slightly outdated.","This text is a good primer on what laboratory equipment is essential and desirable. There are proposals given on how to construct most of the necessary equipment. Quite a lot of detail is given to proposals to keep a laboratory safe, and out of sight and smell. There are also some sections on monitoring the activity of authorities by evesdropping with a radio scanner.The book is beginning to show its age however since quite a bit of focus is put on techniques of improvising one's own glassware. The author's primary supporting claim is that glassware is a ""watched"" item. This view seems a little paranoid/outdated since the advent of procurement opportunities such as Ebay. However, some of the larger glassware devices described are perhaps interesting, in the ""scaling up"" section."
3,a bit bigger than I was looking for,"I'll keep it, of course, as it is perfectly functional, but it looks bigger in person than the product description led me to expect. It could have been half the size and still do the job that it's intended for. It just means I had to get a bigger box for my supplies, and there is less available room in it for other stuff. I'll manage."
4,"Fits well, no release, easily chipped","This is a good protection for the blackberry, though there is no way to release it from the phone. You nearly have to break it off to remove it. I dropped it once and a big chip of paint flew off the front. It did its job though, and protected the phone."
2,There should be a warning label,"The whole execution of this kit is sloppy. The writen history is all wrong. Small people were not recruited for PT boats and they were not made of plywood! They were construsted of solid wood frames and planking just like the yachts that their builders were using before the war. Little people for the crew??? Sounds like kids are working at Revell.The biggest drawback is that this kit MUST be painted. PT boats came in different colors-grey, flat pale green and black and white but none were ever bright shinny Kelly green. Molding our of plain grey would have made more sense. The model will look rediculous unless painted. The box clearly shows a grey hull....there should have been a warning label. I would not have purchased it if I knew I would have to spray paint it.Revell has gotten so sloppy they don't even bother to check what colors they used on prior runs."
4,Its a good model,"Well, I picked this model up just because I love the plane and its a classic in WW2. It was a fun build and was for the most part an easy build. How ever I found it hard to glue the fuel tanks to the wings. That is just about the only con. Other than that its a good buy, and great for beginners"
3,Good Model Airplane But....,I do model kits from time to time but I had a little difficulty with this particular airplane kit. Some of the diagrams didn't seem to showenough of the general areas that I was working in but I did get thru it.
1,Way over priced,"Didnt tell me the age group until it arrived, way to complecated for my 4 year old. Vey basic, no paint, no glue, way to much money for what it is. Gave it away."
1,No Glue Included,I bought this for a sick friend and I was very disappointed to find that there's no glue included in the kit so my friend couldn't put it together. I've purchased other (non-model) kits and everything I needed was included. I couldn't give a star rating because it's still in the box.
4,Nice kit,"Revell always puts together the better sets. This one took me a few days to build and with very little difficulty. The parts fit together nicely. some of the decals fit on the head of a pin, but that is to be expected in accurate kits."
4,Range Rover,"I purchased this belt to replace one that was soon to snap leaving me stranded and having to wait on a tow truck. It is still in good shape after 10,000 miles. It had a nice warranty and so far so good."
1,armyman,SF Planet is a rip-off. Check their reseller ratings. They knowingly send out defective equipment and then hassle you on the return until you are out of the warranty period. Bottom buyer beware!!! I will never do business with them again.
5,Bernard Allison is great!,"This Bernard Allison CD, along with his others, is just outstanding. What a fabulous musician Bernard Allison is! If you love great blues and if you love great music, you will love this extraordinary artist. He is the son of the late, great Luther Allison who died too young. Luther Allison and Bernard Allison make music that will give you pleasure and joy and delight and awe.People who actually love great music need to put their money and purchases where they belong and let the really talented artists receive the praise and rewards they deserve. As I write this today, I have just read of performers like Eminem and others of that ilk whose CDs sell astronomically and who get so much media attention.Come on, music lovers. Put your money where the good music is. You can start with Bernard Allison and Luther Allison."
5,Good Quality Adaptro,I would recommend this quality product and buy additional adapters the vendor. The product arrived on time and worked perfectly.
5,"The book starts with a history, ends with a winning portfoli","I have just finished reading the DOW 40000 by David Elias and found it fascinating reading for investors on any level, expert, novice or anywhere in between. The author starts with a historical perspective of the DOW and takes the reader through the steps to 40000 in 2016. The book is a cornacopia of information and a common sense approach to investing that is optomistic and easy to understand. His optomism is supported by factors that he discusses in great detail, such as demographics, the global economy, technology's impact on the economy, and the all important - BABY BOOMERS! The book starts with a history and ends with a winning portfolio. What more could a reader ask!"
1,"Well, this prediction is working out....","With the Dow heading rapidly below 8000 this book's predictions are really looking great. We only need a 500% gain to get to the levels expected, so that's good...Way to go David Elias you moron."
1,People are Foolish Aren't They?,I've got an alternate title: 'Don't Confuse a Bull Market with Brains'
3,Good but not great,"This book discusses some of the major trends occurring in the world likely to affect stock values and gives some good investing advice. However, it is generally written in the form of opinions without much data, parts are choppily written, and there is very little discussion of non-US markets. About the only reasoning behind the Dow 40,000 prediction given is that if stocks maintain their historical 9-11% average annual gains, the Dow will reach 40,000 by 2016. I preferred reading ""The Roaring 2000s"" by Harry Dent and ""Boomernomics"" by William Sterling and Stephen Waite, which give more detailed data on some of the trends."
1,Makes a great doorstop!,- or paperweight. Might be good for squashing a cockroach. The pages could be torn out and used to light your fireplace. Lots of good uses yet for this one!
1,Absolute Fraudulent Economics,"As is typical of the Keynesians, this thing is so off base that it is almost incomprehensible if it were not so predictable and sad for investors. Do not waste your time listening to the Federal Reserve worshipers or the Keynesians anymore. Go for sound money, real not fiat currency, and precious metals."
4,A great place to start....,"If you want just one album by the Romantics this is the one to get. The big hits are here (""What I Like About You"", ""Talking In Your Sleep""), along with a couple of classic album tracks (""Tell it to Carrie""), and tracks that are now unavailable elsewhere (""A Night Like This"", ""Test of Time""). It's a great overview. The selected tracks carefully included songs from each of the Romantics albums. Given their frequent line-up changes and the uneven quality of some albums, not ALL of the songs are winners, however, bad Romantics tracks are still better than most bands of the era. Play it loud..."
3,It's Lacking...,"Yes, yes, ""Talking In Your Sleep"" and ""What I Like About You"" are some of the finest pop songs ever. I agree. But what about everything else this band did?Judging from the skimpy amount of songs this package delivers, you'd think that these blokes never managed to churn out anything more than two decent songs plus filler in between. The filler on this compilation is rather dismal compared to the primary hits.I would've liked to have seen this disc at least TRY to approach the 80 minutes that CDs can hold. Alas, that's not the case. As such, we get two great tracks, some subpar tracks and a bad impression of the band.A disappointing set."
4,Buy the new album,"This is a decent represention of the band's radio-ready material, but some of the better songs this band recorded is not present on this disc. The Romantics have a new album due out Sept. 9, 2003, titled ""61/49."" It's a no-frills, rock 'n' roll record and is more representative of what the band has evolved into. If you want to hear this band in its most honest form, get 61/49 when it comes out."
5,Romantics. What I like Anout You and other hits,I was worried about audio quality regarding these older recordings. This album has great fidelity and is not low in volume as many are from years ago. Would strongly recommend this album. Great tunes!
1,Do Not Buy The ICON If You Have A Honda Accord,"I installed this blade on my 2006 Accord. The driver's side blade left a large swath in the lower middle of the windshield untouched! I've read that I need to remove the plastic blade guide from the control arm. The problem with that is the small screw holding it in was so tight that I could not turn it, and I was starting to damage the screw head. This blade is not worth the effort. It worked great for my RAV4 but was a total disaster on my Accord."
1,2007 Honda Accord,"The Bosch driver side wiper does not work on a Honda Accord. I have experimented with multiple sizes with no better quality, the blade streaks and leaves large areas not cleared. Apparently the Bosch blade requires a wiper arm that applies more pressure than the Wiper arm. Buy another brand, they work!"
5,Great Replacement for Acura TSX (04-08) OEM Blades,"Theses blades replaced the original blades I had on my 08 TSX when I bought the car new. Although they are a bit pricy, they blow away the OEM blades in terms of performance. The blades are a perfect fit on the windshield. They easily glides across the glass without leaving streaks. Installation isn't too bad once you figure out how to work the TSX's unlocking mechanism."
1,poor quality,I'm goiong to keep this short.... don't buy this brand of wiper. Save your money. Buy a meadium price wiper and replace it every few years.
1,Does not flex properly to windshield,"I installed a set of Bosch ICON wiper blades on my 2003 Honda Accord and am very disappointed with the performance of this product. The driver's side blade (26"") does not flex properly to the contour of the windshield. The outer edges are in proper contact with the glass but the center is not being pressed firmly enough. As a result, a portion direcly in my line of sight is not wiped completely and remains blurry. It is very annoying if not dangerous and I will be replacing them soon."
2,Mediocre Wipers,"I bought a pair for a 2004 honda accord. It worked well for the first week.Afterwards, wipers already started streaking. Was pretty disappointed. Paid a lot of money to have top of the line wipers only to have them streaking. You might as well buy cheaper ones and replace them more frequently."
2,not a fan,I have had these wipers for only 90 days and I am not thrilled with them. I can say that they work well in a heavy downpour but in the snow where intermittent moisture is the case they streak a great amount and miss spots. The OEM wipers that I had on my 07 honda accord worked much better then these. I was expecting to obtain better quality for more money but it was not the case with these wipers.
2,Streaky and missing spots,"Bought them for my 2004 Acura TSX. Replaced my OEM wiper blade assembly with the Bosch ICONs based on reviews on Amazon. Big mistake. My OEM blades lasted for 5 years before chattering. These ICONs are a piece of junk in less than 1 year. Right at the center of the drivers field of view the wiper does not seem to make contact with the windshield at all. Which means during snowy days there is always a patch of dirt right in the center. Seems like the wipers do not exert a force on the windshield right where it attaches to the arms. The rest of the rubber blade is also not great with streaking all over. It has a silent operation, though, but it is no good if it doesn't wipe cleanly."
4,Update: Happy Odyssey Owner,"I first installed this incorrectly on my 2006 Honda Odyssey, and it left a wide smear across my driver's side view. Be sure to remove the small plastic bracket (with phillips head screw) from the driver's side wiper arm. After doing that (a thousand or so miles later) I'm really happy with these blades."
2,Too expensive and dont last,I replaced several wipers at the same time. These Bosch ICON's didn't perform any better or last any longer than the Bosch evolution. Both only lasted 5 months until they started streaking really badly which in my opinion is far too short for what are billed as good quality wipers. I also bought Rain-X blades which seemed to work much better but are not sold by Amazon.
2,Does not fit 2009 Infiniti G37 Coupe!,"I bought this blade in the proper 26"" and 17"" length for my vehicle. The install went fine. In terms of removing water, these blades are great. However, the driver side blade is too thick. The wiper arm is raised too high, causing the windshield spray to hit the arm instead of the windshield. I wish this wasn't the case as I really like how smooth they are. The passenger side works flawlessly."
5,Bosch Icon Blades,"These are by far the best blades I've ever used. This is my second pair. My first lasted me two years. They handle everything. Rain, snow, ice and salty roads. I recommend these to anyone who is tired of streaking blades and having to replace blades multiple times a year."
2,Not worth the money,Have used these for about a month now. Very disappointed that they have started to streak already. Would not buy again for this price.
1,Really bad on Porsche Cayenne,"These wipers are just terrible on a Porsche Cayenne S. Brand new they stink. Something is wrong with the pressure because miss spots, chatter and squeak. I'm not alone complaining about these wipers on the Cayenne. I'm currently seeking an alternative without having to replace the whole wiper arm assembly. These things are expensive and a complete waste."
5,Simple cheap work,used these to make some longer female jack RCA cords for mp3 to car audio system. (cheaper than buying new cords) worked fine.
4,Great Game,"My 3 year old received this game for Christmas and I think it is great! He loves to push on the teeth, and it teaches him to take turns, and also to count. He does, however, think that he wins when the croc bites him, instead of losing, but that's ok with me since it makes him roll with laughter! He loves it! The best part is that there are no batteries or small pieces, so he can play it with his baby brother crawling around and I don't have to worry at all. It does get a bit boring after the 5th time in a row, but put it away and take it back out a few hours later, and my son plays like he hasn't seen it in weeks!"
1,NO stars!,"My 3 year old son wanted this game. He got it for Christmas. After taking it out of the box and playing it once he said"" What else do you do?"". The answer was nothing! This game is very boring. Save your money!"
4,Great toddler fun!,"We bought this toy for our 2 1/2 year old son and we all just love it. Granted it has absolutely no educational value it is fun, simple and something your toddler can easily use on their own if mommy and daddy need a well deserved break ;)"
4,Great toy!,My 3 & 4 yr olds really enjoy this game and never really seem to get bored with it. They love it!
2,Not that exciting!!!,"On the plus side of this game it requires no batteries, has no parts, requires no reading but that is the only this I can say about it that I like.In fact I don't think I would call it a game, It is more like a crocodile toy that snaps shut on your hands when you push the wrong tooth down. I only paid 11 bucks for it and that was too much.I have 5 children under the age of 5 at my day care and a 10 and 12 year old child and let me tell you there is a lot better games out there. Candy Land, Connect four, Dot the Dog, and Fisher price has some preschool games out that are much better than this.Would be an ok addition to a dental program at a preschool or if you just like spending money."
2,Don't buy this toy,"Crcodile dentist is probably the worst game I have ever bought. The crocodile's head comes off so easily and it comes apart after many uses. Don't buy this toy if you have young children because it hurts fingers when it snaps shut. The hard plastic really does hurt, even grown-up hands like mine. This game also gets boring, even to young children. After a few tries, this game just collects dust. The concept is not bad, but they should rethink the design and the game!"
2,Hyped more then it should be.,"My 3-year-old son desperately wanted this game, and while I wanted to get him something more educational (where you actually learned something) I gave in and we got this toy. I wish I hadn't. He played with it for about 20 minutes, and it's seen only the dust in the toybox ever since. The teeth will stick down and not reset, there's really not much fun about this toy, unless you like getting your hand snapped between two 'gator lips!"
1,disappointed in Puerto Rico,"Crocodile Dentist lasted all of one hour!It's a pity that such a fun toy is built so poorly.After several rounds, the mouth simply wouldn't keep open.I'm exchanging it, however, I have the feeling that it's a design problem.Shame on Hasbro for such a poorly designed and manufactured toy.By the way, good luck with with 1-888 toll free number."
2,broke on christmas day,"my 31/2 year old son wanted this for christmas so badly. His grandparents gave it to him for christmas, and after only a few hours of playing, one tooth got stuck down and now it is broken. I am very disappointed in this."
3,fun for a kid,"I agree with the other reviews of this game, it is very simple not much too it. But to a 4 year old sometimes a simple game can be fun, I think it is over priced for what you get. My 2 and 4 year olds have had a lot of fun with this game."
2,Classic Game,"I'll admit that this game gets boring quickly, but I grew up playing that game. To me, it is a classic. When I was just three, my family drove to South Dakota and my brother and I played this game over and over. This was before all the techno toys we have now, but it still amused me for hours on the long boring trip. Today's kids probably would not find this game very entertaining, but I still will buy it for my neice."
3,Croc toy fun only lasts so long,"Although my son and I had a lot of fun playing with this toy, I really had to start ""hamming"" it up for him to continue past 15 mins. It's pretty noisy too, so it wasn't good if another child was napping in the next room. Not much educational value in my opinion but it was fun for a while."
2,Not very interesting,"This is not an interesting toy at all. There's nothing to it other than pushing one tooth and hoping for the best, no counting, no ""strategy"", nothing really. The only way we managed to get some fun at this game was by linking it to something into another game: for example, if you fall into a green square in a ""candyland""-type game then you have to press a button and you loose a turn if you get bitten... I recommend against this toy."
2,not much fun and can scare young toddlers,"This game scared my 2 year old and my 4 year old wasn't thrilled with it either. I don't think it's worth the money at all, it's a game that doesn't have much to it and if it doesn't scare the kid they will be bored with it quickly. (...) I do not suggest paying full price for it at all."
2,Waste of money!,My 4 year-old wanted this for Christmas. What a waste. Way too simple...does not hold kids attention for very long. The only good thing I can say is that is all one piece so you don't have to worry about losing things.
4,Great Buy,I bought this in a set of 4 at walmart but the cleanser and lotion are all you really need to use to see a noticable difference in acne....product is very similar to proactive
5,Get lost Leo! This is the Man In The Iron Mask!,"This version of Dumas' classic has more of a stage/theatrical look. The quality may not be great but it is the best MITIM movie! For fans of Dumas' novel, this story follows relatively well to the book, I strongly recommend it to fans of the original novel!"
5,early ed teacher,"As a certified teacher and homeschooling mom of 4, I find this book easy to use, practical, and appropriate. The lessons are not very time-consuming, require common materials that everyone has on hand, need very little set-up, and really do a good job preparing children for kindergarten. I have bought this book as a baby shower gift for my friends."
3,Be prepared for homemade look,"I bought this because of its recommendation in Bauer and Wise's book (The Well-Trained Mind). It has some good ideas, but you'll have to use your common sense. Many of the ideas are repetitive -- kind of like variations on a theme. Also, the author often suggests activities that the child isn't developmentally ready for yet. And, be warned: this book is VERY homemade in appearance -- handmade drawings, old-fashioned type and layout."
5,Great service!,"It arrived super quick, nice package, no problems. The tonic is very convenient for me because I travel a lot and also it doesn't require cotton balls unless you really want to. It does what it says, smells good. I use it when my skin is very dry, usually in winter time."
3,"An Okay Investment, Murad Hydrating Toner","I was very excited to try this toner since the reviews here on amazon was very positive. However, I do not know if it is all that AMAZING as most people state. (*Side note* Everyone has different skin types, etc. so the results will vary) Personally, I don't like the fragrance--I prefer none to clean smell--this toner smells like a light flower body spray.. I also didn't read carefully and found out that this toner is for people who have dry skin..I, on the other hand, have oily skin...If anyone could recommend me any products that controls facial oil that would be great! Until then, I will be using this product and will not purchase again."
3,Way overpriced,"My kids were DYING for this toy but it didn't hold their attention any longer than the average new toy and I'd say it cost way more than average. My kids may have been old for it, but the mechanical nature of it seems older than the age I would say it appeals to most. I don't recommend it."
2,Crystal DVD,"I am a big Crystal fan, and am always looking for something new from her, but I was really disapointed with the DVD. It was recorded several years ago, and many of the songs were dubbed from her Christmas CD, and were not even re-recorded for the DVD. In a word, stick to her Christmas CD."
1,Not originals!!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. These are not the Original Artists. If you are a purist as I am, you want the Original Artists that sang the song back in those days of great music. These are not the real thing. If you don't mind subs then you will like this."
1,I have 100 reasons why this is a bad movie,but suffice it to say that this movie has only one fight scene with only one kick... need I say more?
1,Damme it,"i am van damme fan because of his martial arts skill. that is the only thing in this movie. the story suck, the acting suck. the only good thing is the action and great camera work by the director. for my rating of buy it, borrow it, or bury it. borrow the movie watch it, keep the fast forward button handy. and then bury the movie."
3,If it wasn't set in Hong Kong it would have sucked.,"The acting, script, and special effects in this movie are bad even by the usual Van Damme movie standards. What is Paul Sorvino doing here? If this movie had been set anywhere else other than Hong Kong, it'd be awful. But for some reason, having it set in Hong Kong actually seems to make it work. Kind of like a tribute to the cheesy Hong Kong movies of Jackie Chan, Jet Li, John Woo etc."
4,Not bad... but not good either.,"The best thing about this film is the cinematics. Being a student filmmaker, I was awe struck by the action scenes and how the camera never stopped moving. The camera operator must have gotten hurt from all that stuff flying all over the place! I recommend this movie to any other student filmmaker. That's it."
1,"A terrible, terrible movie","This has to be one of the worst movies ever made- a non-sensical plot, poor acting, poor martial arts and action. Save yourself a video rental fee. Van Damme has slipped as an action star, and this movie is one reason why."
3,Fun Van Damme action...,"Jean-Claude Van Damme is one of those actors you either are a fan of or you despise. Me? I'm a big fan, so that makes me a little less qualified to rate this film, but I'll review it nonetheless. It takes place in Hong Kong, where the market for ""knock offs,"" or imitations of an original product, is blossoming. Van Damme and Rob Schneider play two business partners who are caught up in a nasty circle with the Chinese mafia, renegade CIA agents, and big bad guys. The action and direction from Tsui Hark is awesome, especially a scene where Van Damme slides around on a boat while beating up bad guys. Rob Schneider is not too annoying in this film, which is a good thing. The bad guy, however, was a bit underwhelming, but his demise works. Van Damme films are never any cinematic accomplishment by any means, but they can be, and usually are, plenty of fun. This is no exception."
4,Great action in spite of a silly plot!,"And cheesy special effects! But this movie held my attention throughout! Van Damme, playing a fashion tycoon's right hand man, helps the CIA track Russian terrorists who are using counterfiet goods to smuggle explosives(nano-bombs according to the script) to the US to cause a massive terrorist bomb plot. And the action comes thick and fast, including a rickshaw race, a van demolishing a supermarket and a great fight scene in a cargo ship. Van Damme displays his martial arts skills well, but this isn't his finest moment(that's reserved for SUDDEN DEATH and KICKBOXER!). Overall, well worth seeing, especially for tha cinematography."
2,Not Van Damme,"I love Van Damme's movies, but this one was terrible. Actually, I think it was more the director. The actors were terrible, and what's up with all the slow and fast motion sceens?!? I agree with the other viewer about the movie trying to be like Jackie Chan movies. It's just not Van Damme's style."
3,Van Damme Coasting on a half-tank,"The film was better than I expected it to be (then again, I was expecting it to be total garbage), but that's only because of the hong-kongish editing and panache that Tsui Hark excels in. Rob Schneider is reasonably funny, but not as funny as Jean-Claude as a totally mismatched 'fashion' designer. It's a step down from Double Team, and far from his best action flick. But any script from DeSouza is worth a listen. Rent it anyway."
2,I could not watch it again,"The movie was full of action and John Schneider was a very effective comic relief. However, the plot, although plausible was not easy to follow and there were to many relationship gaps in the movie."
1,A Dog,"This movie is a dog, pure and simple. We ended up with two of these as they are the freebie give-aways for the last few DVD players we bought. They can't sell it, so they're giving them away. Hide ...fast !"
2,no...just...no,"i don't even know where to start.i gave this movie two stars because i like van damme.this movie has no plot,barely any action,and worst of all,horrific camerawork.if u r a van damme fan like me than rent it.i just taped it on cable tv.but then i taped over it.if u r a van damme fan,rent it first,but if u r not a fan,skip it,this is not an ""action"" movie that u wanna watch"
5,this is a good Van Damme action movie,ok the movie is good but it could have been better...i like this movie and the action scences are really good and i like the little beat that it has at the end of the movie with the action parts ...it's a good action movie but if your looking for drama or anything else you won't find it here that's in the movie Nowhere To Run...this is a good movie because of the action that van damme puts into it......van damme is the best and always will be the best martial artist ever
2,save your money,"I expected better. For someone described as a ""truly international writer"" and lauded for ""weaving paradoxes"" or some other critical crap, this book was a real flop.Supposedly exploring the many sides of Hong Kong throughout the decades, it doesn't glue in any way, and the disjointed prose hardly helps. There was one good story (the one about the letters), and I forgot its name (sorry).As a Hong Kong resident, I thought, ugh, I mean, just what is it, this trend of ""new-wave oriental fiction"", defiantly flouting their cultural identity while succumbing to capitalistic pleasures and all that? It just adds to the crumbling heap of bad-lit like ""Daughter of China"" and so on."
3,Skillful but not endearing,"The singing is good. That said, most songs were not clever and many are overtly political and suck the fun out of the CD.The connection to NPR made by another reviewer makes sense -- The Bobs were marketing themselves -- but I expect gentle kidding and silly situations in this genre. ""Paper or Plastic"" is a great example, clever, well-executed. Download that song if you can and skip the rest of this CD...unless you just love a capella music for the harmonies."
5,Great fit for Canon T2i/550d w/external battery pack,"It was a little hard to guess how well this would fit on my Canon T2i/550d w/an external battery pack. It fits great. I'm not planning to use anything but a 50mm or a medium telephoto, and it does the job. It has an internal strap that can be screwed into the camera base, or a rubber ring can be used for attaching it to the lens (the base screw works well). For a quick neoprene wrap, this is a good deal."
4,samsung blu-ray 1500,"overall this product is okay. the only complain is it makes noise when you load and start to play, other than that i'm very pleased."
4,The Hosa GXX144 XLR Male to XLR Male Gender Changer is real handy to have in Your adapter box we you are using someone elses equ,When setting up at the church for a Veterans Dinner and Talk from a WW2 Veteran I found that the Wall jacks where just the other way around them pulling in to my AMP. With the Hosa GXX144 XLR Male to Male Gender Changer I was able to plug in and run my Lap top with a Pin Point show.
2,Not necessarily for Celtic Woman fans,"I own the majority of albums from the Celtic Women and they are among my all-time favorites. I bought this album without even previewing most of the tracks, and now that I have heard the entire album, I'm sorry I purchased it. I'm not sure how to describe this music; sweet, ethereal? To me it is too contemporary, tuneless, repetitive in spots. I realize this is a matter of taste, and I think the talent and production values are top notch here. I would caution you though to preview the tracks before you buy, and make certain this is what you want."
2,"OK CD, nice voice","I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though."
5,Great Tool,I am not an audiophile but I love my old vinyl and this has made the transfer to digital easy. It exports in WAV or MP3 formats and has some editing abilities I have yet to master. I have enjoyed this simple solution to transfer my albums to digital recordings. My one complaint is that there is no on/off switch.
3,Works good....For Now.....,"I've been using this preamp with XP and Vista for about a year with no problems.However, windows 7 is another story. The drivers no longer work in Win7. There is no Volume control, even though the Windows Sound panel shows the level meter going up and down, I am unable to get any application to get an input from this unit.I have left 2 separate inquiries, over the past 2 months, to ART's customer service, via their website (No phone #'s available) and have never received a reply to my queries asking weather the device will ever support Win 7.So Just a warning, if you are planning on upgrading to Windows 7 This year, don't plan on this unit working with it."
5,Great Little Preamp,"I wanted to put my 45 year old - 200 plus LP's on cd's. I had a 10 yr old - in good shape Technics turntable plus a $25.00 preamp, this preamp was ok when it was hooked up to the AUX input of one of my other receivers but was clipping the audio output of the turntable when I used it with my newly installed software; Spin it Again & Audacity.I read the other reviews on the ART Phono Plus v2 and purchased the preamp to my satisfaction - its inexpensive and does the job right, its adjustable and matches the software. This is great for beginners like me and once it is set up per the directions and you practice with your software -(Spin it Again) for me , you have some good old sounds coming out of your home or car CD players."
2,ART USB Phono Plus incompatible with my iMac (Aluminum),"I tried using the ART USB Phono Plus with a new iMac (Aluminum case), but was unsuccessful. Roughly a third of the way into recording an LP and a terrible hum would develop. It would then be necessary to shut down the iMac in order to get rid of the hum. ART shipped me another unit under warranty, but I continued to have the same problem. I tried various cables, each of the three USB ports on the back of the computer, etc. No luck. I've since purchased the (much higher priced) RME Fireface 400 and have been extremely satisfied by the quality 96kHz/24bit recordings I've made of my better LPs. I've been using Amadeus Pro on the Mac as recording software after finding Audio Hijack Pro extremely buggy at higher sampling rates. For me the Audacity software had a rather cumbersome interface."
1,Playstation memory card,"The memory card did not work. Sent in original package, game system is brand new but card did not work. Sent this message twice and had no response and no new or replacement item sent out. Poor customer service."
1,Readers beware!,"Good introductory books on assembly language are hard to come by, especially for the Intel platform. This is an attempt to fill the gap, and looking through the topics covered, it looks promising. Unfortunately, the language is so poor that the book is virtually unreadable. Almost every piece of information is repeated 2 or 3 times, sometimes resulting in an almost comical effect.So, better luck with another book..."
4,a cheaper pad that works fine for me,This was what was on my rear brakes on my Superlight -- since they worked fine I decided to replace with the same pad. Note that I only weight 175 lbs. A little noisy until I wiped the disc with rubbing alcohol.
5,Required Reading,"If you think our current legislators are useless idiots, read the title essay of this volume. Henry Adams was a direct Adams descendant , John Quincy's son, I believe. He lived thru the period he writes about. Great essay about the dithering, congress as they tried to prevent the secession of the southern states. As today, legislators were simply not up to task. A few southern fire-eaters and assorted lunatics brought about the bloodiest war in US history, while the useless congressmen postured and rung their hands. Adams was a pessimist as a historian, for good reason. It makes one wonder of the House of Representatives was, ever worth a damn, it certainly was not the peoples house that Franklin idealized."
5,Great readers theatres scripts,I commend Aaron Shepard for producing the Readers theatres scripts which many teachers use for their classroom. I use them with my class. Reading and rereading the text helps my students become fluent readers. Thank you Aaron for this book.
4,Good reading!,"You won't learn how to sing with this book but if you already have a good technique and just want to hear how others put their vocal technique into words then this is a good read for you! It's not a ""how to sing"" guide - but hearing how the professionals relate to their voices was interesting!"
5,Great Tips for the Well Trained Singer,I'm a mezzo soprano with more than 40 years of performance experience and I learned new things when I read this book. It's not for beginners as the technical references would be confusing. But for the experienced singer who always wants to learn and improve there is a wealth of information. On the first read through I just examined what the mezzos had to say...a good way to get info quickly for your particular voice type...then I sat down and read it all. This will be a permanent part of my music library.
4,Does what it was made to do,"I used the unit to power my laptop computer for movies on a vacation trip. It worked fine...powered the laptop all the time it was used. No complaints. Even though the unit produces a ""modified"" sine wave voltage (looks kinda like a square wave)...it worked like house current. It did get a little warm, but there is a built in fan so it stayed stable. Good price and it worked better than I expected."
3,"Adequate, not the best performance.","For the price paid, it does its job. But the Xantrex units are superior.Here's why:1. It's made of plastic, therefore the lack of aluminum heatsinking means the BD must run a fan constantly when on. It adds noise.2. When used to power a laptop adapter, the laptop picks up a buzzing noise from the BD which can be heard over the laptop's audio output.:(3. Single outlet, others have 2.The one cool thing is it has a cig. plug pass through, which could be handy in certain situations."
3,Didn't last as long as I thought it should,"I bought this unit to run my laptop from the car when on the road. It worked fine for about 18 months, then it just went up in smoke. I checked the fuse but it was ok. But instead the electronics fried. Since I was on the road and needed another one immediately, I had to pay full retail for one from Radio Shack. But that one is not a B&D and has worked fine since I bought it. For the money this unit is ok, but I would not recommend this unit and would use the money to buy a better unit. I would not buy this unit again."
3,"Not bad, but no powerhouse","This is a decent unit for a laptop or basic AC power needs. My first unit would shut down, or the fan would refuse to turn on. I returned it for a new one, and it's working fine. I would probably get a larger one (400 watt would be ideal) if I could do it again, but for $20 - it was a great deal."
1,"Garbage, don't buy it!","I ordered one through Amazon and it didn't work at all. So I bought the same one from Wal-Mart. I blew the fuse on it (my fault) because I plugged in an air compressor that was too strong for it. So I bought the 400-W model, which easily cleared the limits for watts and amps as stated on the machine itself, but it also blew the fuse! I got another fuse and ran a laptop off of the 400, but wouldn't try the air pump again. I don't know if I just had bad luck with B&D, but I wouldn't buy another of these inverters."
5,Perfect case for FZ-18 / FZ-28 / FZ-35 / FZ-40 & M4/3 MFT,"This is a really good case for Panasonic FZ long zoom cameras (FZ18, FZ28, FZ35, etc.). Especially good if you don't need to bring along filters or other accessories and just want to protect your camera inside of a backpack or daypack. If you are looking for a slighter larger case standalone case then you should look atTamrac 5230 T30 Camera/Camcorder Bag (Black)I am also now using this case for a DMC-G5 with 14-45mm lens attached. I think it's a slightly better fit that this oneOP/TECH USA Soft Pouch Digital D-M 4/3 - Black."
4,OP/TECH D-Offset Pouch - for Panasonic FX30,"This item fits nice and snug. It keeps the dust and dirt off the camera when not in use. Made of the same material that wetsuits are made from (neoprene?) I found that the little ""holster"" that can hook up to the camera to keep it attached is pretty useless though - I cut mine off. Otherwise, a nice easy way to keep the camera clean and to slightly protect it. Better than a big clunky leather one in my opinion, because I can scrunch it up when not in use and put it in my pocket or wherever."
2,Coby DVD Player,"The picture is really nice, but playback time did not last long. First time charge lasted less than 1 hour and playback time indicated low battery before the end of a movie less than 1-1/2 hours long. Still need to recharge and try again and see if playback lasts longer this time around. Really like the slim design and really good picture quality. But not happy with battery life."
2,Battery inadequate,I bought this player for viewing movies while camping. Fortunately we usually sleep in our SUV so we have access to a DC power outlet. This player does come with a cord that plugs into a cigarette lighter outlet. Otherwise it would be totally useless because the fully charged battery only lasts about 45 minutes. The picture is ok but colors are not at all bright or vibrant. The sound is barely loud enough even when you're sitting two feet from the unit. I've only watched two movies on it so far and it froze up once requiring a restart from the beggining of the movie but it does have a scene skip that allowed us to get back to where we left off pretty quickly. If it keeps working I'd say it was worth the $50 I paid for it at CVS.
1,Tick tick tick... Ca-thunk.,"I bought this thing at a department store than focuses on clothing, and that should have been my first clue.As several others have written. WHEN this thing works, it works ok. HOWEVER, all too often it refuses to read the DVD. It will display ""Wrong Disk"", ""Data Error"", or as is most often the case, it will just whirl and clunk, tick like a time-bomb, and than whirl and clunk some more. Sometimes, it will read parts of a multi-section DVD, and not others.And the operations: The remote AND the buttons of the machine itself are all very confusing, and difficult to operate. The main part on the unit being this small circular disk that you have to press the correct part of, juuuust right, and sometimes hold down, other times press repeatedly (and rapidly), or it ends up doing the wrong thing.Now, I'm not a no0b. I am in fact a television production specialist with 10 years in the business. In my opinion this thing is a piece of junk."
2,was okay while it lasted,"I couldn't complain about the picture while my machine lasted. (about 6 mos.) sound not very good for use in an auto without ear plugs. got where it couldn't seem to read my dvd's.At least the motor still works, just can't watch anything. Don't recommend due to its short life."
1,dead upon receipt,"Received this as a promotion from a pharmaceutical firm. Battery lasts 5 minutes. Had vivid color and great sound but must always be plugged in. trying to resolve battery issue, ie., receive a free replacement, through the manufacturer."
2,battery life,Battery was manufactured 3 yrs ago & holds charge for less than 20 minutes.Marketing & selling this machine as new is misleading.TB Digital recomended by Amazon as a supplier of this product has not responded to my request to resolve this problem.
3,portable dvd player,"Battery just lasts between 45 and 55 minutes. Screen sometimes gets blurry, and I have to turn it off and switch it on again."
2,Coby Portable DVD Player,"When I first got the Portable Dvd player I charged the battery and when I inserted a dvd and after a few minutes it would freeze and skip certain parts of the movie. I tried to restart it and tried other dvds and it kept saying ""Wrong Disc"". So anyone who is looking to get this Portable dvd player I advice you not to becuase it will cause a lot of problems and its just going to be a waste of money."
3,"decent performance, poor design","This player has two drawbacks, short battery life, (50 minutes), and limited control without the remote.The local controls would be adequate IF the stupid machine didn't always launch with the English subtitles on. You must have the remote to turn them off. Very inconvenient when trying to watch a movie on a plane, but then, it's worthless on a plane since the battery only lasts less than an hour anyway. (What WERE they thinking?!!) Hey, its a Coby, you get what you pay for."
1,"Company has bad RMA policy. Bad Coby, Bad!","This is a link from the Coby website. Mine does not 'spin up' so can't read disks after 2 months of ownership and maybe 15 hours of use.""To obtain warranty replacement, return the product freight prepaid to the address below within the duration of the warranty. Please enclose the product, copy of receipt, detailed description of the problem and a money order in the monetary amount found on your warranty card. The money order should be made out to COBY ELECTRONICS and covers the cost of return shipping and handling.""They want me to pay a HANDLING fee on top of return postage- and maybe more if they determine that I somehow caused the problem.Forget this company. Bad Coby, Bad!"
2,Junk,"Flimsy. Buttons have to push sometimes twice or three times for a response. Has trouble reading DVDs and the ones it doesn't have trouble with take a lot of time.After 30-40 minutes of playing will simply ""pause"" with the picture frozen, sometimes pushing play again will get it going other times it just re-boots back to the ""loading DVD"" blue screen.After 2-1/2 months of medium use (2-3 discs a week), the thing stopped reading discs.Cheap, ""knock-off"" brand; avoid if you want something that will last."
2,It worked for 2 days!!!!!,NIce little item-but it only worked for 2 days when it lost halfof the screen. Contacted company (J&R;) and they said it was within 30 daywarranty so I sent it back-have not received new replacement that theypromised-wait and see.
4,good anthology of an underrated musician,"Listening to this I'm surprised David Newman is not better known.Disc1 contains a lot of his recordings with Ray Charles , it is possible that the current buzz about Ray will rekindle some interest in Newman - a long time collaborator. These tracks are excellent as one would expect with Newman's bluesy jazz blending with Rays R&b; and soul.Disc2 contains mostly instrumental jazz, which like most of Newman's work is strongly influenced by R&B.;Ad with the other Rhino- Atlantic anthologies, the packaging and presentation are excellent with a nice 2 CD case and a well written booklet packed into a slipcase.3.5 stars or 7/10 would be the most accurate rating for this."
2,Quality quality quality,"I was happy to find these beautifully done movies on DVD, but I was very disappointed with the transfer quality. And when I went to Walmart the next week and saw them there for about $20.00 less than I paid (less shipping) online, I was really unhappy.If you're going to bother selling something on DVD wait until you can do it in the quality that the public has come to expect when purchasing something on this medium. Its with great effort that I am even able to conjure up two whole stars."
3,The First Two Movies Are Superb The Third One's A Flop!,"I love the books and the first two movies but the third movie, The Continuing Story was awful! It was so disappointing!"
5,This game is a great addition to the trilogy,"What can I say. real quick and sweet, this game is great. The game play is really good. The AI on both the controllable and computer controlled it really well done. I love the sounds that they have incorporated into the game. Having never shot any of the guns, I cant say for sure but they all sound very realistic. The humor is good. The story line does not disappoint either. I have not finished it yet but am close but so far, GREAT. Would highly recommend this game but would recommend playing the first two in order before this one so you get the full effect of the trilogy."
1,Too many bugs - wait for the patches,I really looked forward to the release of this game and pre-ordered it way back in the Summer.The graphics are great and the squad controls are pretty slick.My only issue is that the game is constantly (albeit momentarily) freezing during game play and occasionally simply hangs my entire PC requiring me to do a hard power down of the box.I am running a 2.66Ghz Quad core with 2 GB of memory and 2 GeForce 8800 GTX video cards. I should not have a problem running the game.I am sure that they will work the kinks out but right now the game experience is pretty bad.
4,"Great storyline, fluid controls, repititve missions","The story was excellent, and I'd say it is about on-par with most movies/TV shows. At first I thought it was a continuation or a parallel storyline to Band of Brothers. It's cable or movie quality stuff.The controls are fluid, I had no trouble being immersed in the action.The missions can get very reptitive and it is frustrating that your character (Matt) keeps dumping good weapons automatically before new missions. The K34 sniper rifle was excellent but you could only use it in a few missions.Pros: Great graphics, ran smoothly on my P4 3.0 / X1950 GT setup. Excellent sound with easy squad control.Cons: Repetitive missions, dumbed down vehicle interface, can't get the good weapons and keep them throughout the game.Overall: 3/5"
1,Talk about dissapointing,"This has to be one of their worst series of BIA.Graphics is amazing and some of the best Ive seen in a game, but my guess is that comes at an expense. My computer maxes out at 100 %CPU use with this game on a 2.4Ghz machine.I also hate the long and repetitive movie scenes in this game. If I wanted to watch a movie I would have rented one. Gameplay is some of the worst Ive encountered, so bad that I wondered if my machine was messed up. Moving around, you feel like your character is a bobble-head. Your screen continually is bobbing up and down as you move and left me feeling like the game is anything but smooth! This also occurs when you look around, dont know what it is, but Ive never encounterd this in any other game.The scenes are just plain boring...every scene is different groups of Germans hiding behind a wall/table that are staggered in a zig-zag pattern. Work your way up, zig zagging and kill them. Next scene, different location, same scenario!"
2,bad arcade port for the PC,"I really like all of the 2nd WW games- 1st or 3rd person. This game, however, suffers because of it's arcade style conversion from the X-box to the PC. The interaction controls are clunky and the graphics look fairly poor, even though i have fairly advanced PC parts. The only good part of this game is the cartoon trailers at the beginning of each section. I just don't understand why game developers waste their time on making DVD's like this- they have ALL seen what companies like Bethesda Softworks can make. The sad thing here is that the story line was above average, but the game programming itself was terrible- behind-the-times & a waste-of-time. I paid $5.00 plus free delivery on Amazon- don't pay more that this."
1,Hell's Hiqhway sucks,"This game sucks. If I wanted a war movie I would have ordered ""The Longest Day."" It would appear that the artists that created this game were more interested in showing off their technical prowess in writing a story line than letting the player play. The game is full of extraneous BS. Half the mb are taken up with 'film' and 'story' line. This is the worst of the ""Brother's in Arms"" series."
3,Review -- SO FAR,"**I will try to update this review after I have been using the product for a few weeks**I just received this product in the mail not twenty minutes ago. Unfortunately, AmericaRX took about 2.5 weeks to even ship it. That was a bit annoying because I had expected to have it in no more than 2 weeks.Anyway, I opened the package and immediately applied it to my face. I can see what people mean when they say it had a strong smell! It's not necessarily a bad smell; it's like a combination of herbs, menthol, and DIRT! Personally I like the smell but I can understand how some people wouldn't. I'll be applying this probably 2-3 times a day. I will update my review after I have determined it's effectiveness."
4,Worth a try... has made a difference,"I suffer from hormonal acne at the age of 32 around my mouth, chin area. I heard about using tree-tea oil. I found it here on Amazon and after reading all the reviews I had to try it. I think it makes a difference. It's natural and refreshing. It doesn't smell very pleasant, and you have to dilute it with water. I put my witch hazel astringent on a cotton round and then put the tea tree oil on that. I've seen improvement on my skin. My breakouts are less. I still have a pimple here but there are fewer and this combination I have been using is speeding up the recovery time. I would recommend to someone who is as frustrated as I have been with these skin issues."
4,Pretty good,"I bought this as an acne treatment after my skin had a bad reaction to benzoyl peroxide. This is definitely easier on my skin than the benzoyl peroxide, but it is also slightly less effective. I'm told it takes a few months to see the results of tea tree oil. I've been diluting it with water 1/9 (because it's too strong to put directly on the skin). I'm going to try moving up to 1/6 to see if that works any better/more quickly."
4,bought for facial cleansing,"I bought this to use with my oil cleansing routine ([...]). I think I will go back to castor oil and olive oil, and use this tea tree oil for the occasionaly breakout. I am also planning on using it when I get a cold sore again. Also, I am going to make my husband use it on his athlete's foot problem. It just smells so strong that I don't like using it all over my face. Also, keep away from your eyes! It comes in a glass bottle with a heavy plastic lid. Overall, I think it is a good product to have in your home."
5,funk is the sho nuff truth,"you can't fake the funk.the drums,boards,guitar solos and the thumping bass and the fat horns are real music.things that are badly missing from music today.i personally love all of the funk in your face series.the original long versions are on time.but vol 4 is my fav by a fro puff.hearing flutes&wah wah effects grooving to the funk is fantastic.beautiful time of music.and no it ain't disco or looping or sampling you either had the funk or you had to go.lots of fun."
1,Don't waste your money,"My comment before I got this CD was for the price how could one go wrong. Now that I have it - it is a total waste. Not even close to the originals. It even sounds like it was recorded on a slow speed. Save your money. I only got it for the Belmonts' recording, ""Come On Little Angel"", but I wanted the original. Majorly disappointed."
4,Life Before Nirvana and Garbage,"There was Fire Town, a Madison based band who made two albums for Atlantic. In The Heart Of Heart Country (1987-not on CD) showcased a pop rock feel in the grand style of Shoes/BoDeans. Their last album The Good Life is one of the great lost classics of the 80s to which they perfected their harmonies and Byrds like guitar, and should have had hits from such songs like Miles Away and She Remains Me Of You. Throw in Hollies like vocals and you have one the best pop albums of the 80s. Very hard to find in Mad City. (Grade A-)"
4,The Best Of Morrissey,"this cd includes some nice tracks by Morrissey but it is missing some songs. if i picked the songs i would of kept The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get. Suedehead. Everyday Is Like Sunday. November Spawned A Monster. The Last Of The Famous International Playboys. Interesting Drug. I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday. Alma Matters. Sister I'm A Poet. Tomorrow.the other songs i would of put are: Ouija Board, Youre The One For Me Fatty, Lucky Lisp, The Boy Racer, Skin Storm, Michael's Bones, Dagenham Dave, Such A Little Thing Makes Such A Big Difference, Roy's Keen, and the rare song I Know Very Well How I Got My Note Wrong (which was only included on a 7 inch or 3 inch cd with the Durutti Column Album Vini Reilly)..well i hope this was helpful..go for it..its a good cd."
2,Not Happy,"Some songs do not play, they skip. I knew this cd was used but since it was categorized as Very Good, it would work, just like the others I've ordered."
3,a nice surprise!,"I recently saw a video by morissey called tomorrow on VH1 Classic and thought the song was cool. So I decided to check this release out. I am so glad I did because their are so many great songs on this collection. Morrissey writes from the heart and has a wonderful singing voice. You can hear the pain in his voice in the song ""tomorrow"" This is a geat disc. Check it out!!!"
3,"3 Stars - Only 4 good songs, but you need to have them","It's too bad there weren't more hits after the Smiths. So you have to buy this CD for the 4 good songs it has... then you have to buy 2 ""Greatest Hits"" CD's by the Smiths to get maybe another 6-8 good songs. That's it folks... If you're a fan, then do it. Otherwise, you have to listen to the radio and catch an occasional 80's flashback marathon."
4,"Missing ""Spider""","This is a great compilation, but where, oh where, is their first single, ""The Red Back Spider""? Strangely, it is on NONE of their CD's available, not even the ones from ""Wounded Bird"" records.This injustice needs to be corrected."
4,Star Rider's Review,This is a must for anyone that likes classic rock. I gave it overall 4-stars. The last cut Martian Boogie is 5+stars!!!!!!
4,JAW review,This is the complete Brownsville Station collection. It reminds of the songs you forgot they did from the 70's.
5,Kings of the Party,"I never actually saw Bs in concert. I was born 8 years after they broke up. But I was brought up on Kick Ass rock and roll. Brownsville Station IS Kick ass Rock and Roll. They lived it, loved it and they define it. This awesome album is proof that Brownsville Station is the most underated band ever! I think they did ok because they have a loyal following still even today. They should have been huge. But I am baffled as to why bands with no talent like Kiss and that suck ass make it big. But anyhow i love Brownsville Station and hope the boys from the band are doing alright. Go BS!!!!!"
3,chassis to body,"I have been assembling model cars for many, many years and I just completed the '55 Chevy Bel Air by AMT/Ertl. The chassis did not fit well due to the interior assembly being what appears to be too ""thick"", or deep. This is probably the worst AMT/Ertl model I have ever had. One of the parts was not labeled at all (numbered) on the mold. Excess plastic on most parts, beyond what is the norm. I ended up lengthening the driveshaft, modifying the firewall insert, removing the set of tires I originally installed and replaced them with thinner tires from another model, removed much of the chassis hump so it fit into the interior assembly, and filed out some of the interior bottom. After all that the completed model turned out just okay. I am disappointed with it. The paint job is good. I am going to get a Revell/Monogram 55 Chevy and see how that goes."
1,Why can't I rate this pump a 'ZERO'?,"I read the reviews and figured for the cost it was worth the risk. Well, it failed after 10 days, the motor just went dead, and I spent almost 2 weeks arguing with the ""geniuses"" from Evenflo about this pump. The 10 days my wife used it, it worked very well, although a little loud. As a precaution, we bought a ""slightly used"" Medela Swing pump on ebay for $58.00 and spent an additional $13.00 for a new membrane and shield and it works flawlessly, even 2 months later! We finally managed to get Wal-Mart to let us return it, we had to show it was broken when we opened it. Spend a little extra and get something that will work and last."
1,absoute junk,"this is the worst product made on earth. what a piece of junk. it starts to break down after 1 and half days. this is a total waste of money. it causes so much frustration and wastes so much time to use this lousy pump. in addition, this is so user-unfriendly. this product should rate below 1 star if there is any such rating. This product is asboutely awful."
4,Great pump for working mothers,"I only use it twice a day at work and it has never given me problems. Suction is good, not great. You can plug it in to a wall or use batteries, this good for on the go use. Fits with my Dr. Brown bottles.The only con I have is it's really loud.Other than that its a great pump I use everyday."
1,Don't waste your money on this junk.,"I should have listened to the comments before purchasing this junk. It only lasted a week. The valve on the second pump (the one that is not attached to the motor) would get stuck after a minute and i would have to stop pumping and dry it out. As all you mothers that pump would know, it sucks to interupt the pump when your milk is flowing smoothly. I paid $50 for this worthless piece of junk. They should discontinue this product. I had to end up spending $250 for the Medela Pump in Style pump. I should have bought that from the start. It is soo much better than this pump. Also the description said it was a quiet pump. NOT! It was so loud (sounded like a lawn-mower) that i would have to pump in another room. I would recommend every one to not purchase any Evenflo products. I have a baby car seat manufactured by them and it was not easy to use at all. The only good products that they do sell are the baby bottles."
1,Worked for a month!!!,I bought this pump after I had to return the rental to the hospital.Boy was that a mistake.I bought it because I didnt want to spend a lot of money and I didnt know how long I was going to breastfeed for.It's super loud and super top heavy and the bottles would always fall over and leak milk.I only used this pump for a month before it completly died but before that I would get such a small amount of milk that sometimes I would just dump it out.I now own the Lansinoh double electric and the Avent Isis manual.I couldnt be happier with these two pumps. I use the manual when I'm feeding just to get the other side and the Lansinoh when I'm at work or if I miss a feeding.Since I've been using these two pumps my supply has incresed.
3,Good enough for emergencies,"We bought this pump as an emergency backup. It is good enough to be a cheap item that you keep in your car, but I'd never have considered this to replace my Medela Pump In Style Advanced.The reason why the dual pump gets lower reviews than the single is that the second pump is daisy-chained off the first -- so you're getting the same amount of suction for both breasts (you can use only the one at a time, though). Not conducive to pumping more than a couple of ounces, if you're lucky. The four-ounce capacity of the bottles is rather optimistic, in my opinion, especially since the entire unit can run on 3 AA batteries.So, if you're stuck somewhere and desperately need to pump off a bit of excess, you can use this unit. It rates better than a manual pump simply because at least you don't end up with sore hands as well. Understand, however, that you'll still have to hold onto the pump(s) as you go -- so driving while pumping is out of the question!"
3,Good product for the money,"I got this after my son came 5 weeks early and had to spend time in the NICU - I used this pump until my hospital pump came. It works good. I noticed I did have some milk back up which caused some suction problems, but its easy to fix. I still use it occasionally when I need to pump some. Still works great after almost 8 1/2 months of use. It is a great pump to have for occasional pumpings - I would not use this one for pumping every single day though. Good pump for the money"
1,NO return policy on this after 90 days,"This pump worked ok for the first 4 months and then it stopped working altogether. I called Target stores they said you have to go through evenflo. I called evenflo and pretty much they told me I had broken it because I didn't wet the horn?? After talking to a manager I was able to get a new motor but I had to pay the shipping. The new motor doesn't work like the first one at all, so I don't really use it now. This is a faulty pump that if it breaks pretty much evenflo says it is your fault. Sorry I am frustrated and don't want others to be away from their baby for the night and suffer the pain of a broken pump."
2,Very Frustrating....,"I have problems with the pump draining into the bottles. It fills up the chamber and I have to break the suction from my breast and let it run for a while in order for it to drain. Sometimes I even have to stop the pump, completely take it apart and break the valve open for it to drain. I wash/sterilize it as directed and I've tried replacing the valves as well, with the ones provided as extras. I should have saved my $$$ for a Medela pump. The pump works, it just gets very frustrating to have to watch the side of the chamber until it fills up, so that I can stop and drain it."
2,love it but...,"I really like how it works at first, but the suction has stopped working after 5 days! I was really disappointed coz I produce 7-8 ounces from both breasts in 10-15 mins session and really needed the pump badly."
2,"Loved it at first, BUT....","They were amazing at first, I just loved them, but they stopped working after 2 months. I am really disappointed, because I thought I had found a great product for SO much cheaper than the rest. Wouldn't recommend it."
5,The Best Breast Pump,"Evenflo Comfort Select Dual Auto-Cycling Breast Pump is the best breast Pump ever used by my Wife. The dual fuctions really decreases the time by half and is very fast without pain, very comfortable."
1,Worst pump I've ever used!!,"This pump is junk! I'm always getting milk on my leg because the milk backs up and the only way to get it to go into the bottle is to tap it hard on the counter. It's completely ridiculous! Also, the pump with the ""on/off"" switch sucks harder than the other one, even when I have the other one on maximum. This has resulted in lowering my milk supply which really ticks me off, cause I already had a low supply. I would NEVER recommend this product - save your money!! A manual pump from the hospital is better than this."
1,DON'T BUY IF YOU PUMP MORE THAN ONCE A DAY!,This was the second pump I purchased. I was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand I bought. This pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the AC plug in is much weaker than the other side. The motor died out after 2 weeks of use. This pump is not meant for everyday use. I just bought a Medala and I hope to have a better expeirence with it.
2,Not comfortable.,"That would be one of my problems with this pump. It hurt, it took forever, I did not have a good expereince with this pump."
1,Garbage,This is the worst pump you could buy. I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down. It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work. PLEASE don't waste your money....... I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product. If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing. I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product.
1,Don't bother,"This pump never worked, not once. I pumped for 6hours - and I am not overestimating - and got less than 2oz! Thought at the time maybe it was just me not producing but after trying to use it this time and getting nada, I realize it's the pump. I was told by many many nurses that they do not recommend this pump and this is exactly the reason. Now I've wasted the money on this one and I'm gonna have to spend more to rent or buy a better one. Thanks alot, Evenflo!"
1,Worst breaspump,"This pump was cheap but did not last. Customer service was horrible. This pump decreased my milk. It was loud, uncomfortable and poor or no suction. I contacted customer service they sent out a new pump. I still had the same issues with a brand new pump. Of course they were not aware of any issues. The problems started after only 4 weeks. I purchased a Medela pump it was the best investment. If you are unable to purchase Medela pump. Rent one from your local hospital it will make a great difference in nursing and you milk production. Medela all the way."
1,Don't buy this.,"I registered for this and got it as a gift. A couple days after I was home from the hospital, I went to go pump.The pumping suction is terrible. It's a joke. It took me four hours of squeezing and pushing, along with pumping to get one single ounce.I thought I was drying up, I rented a hospital grade one, and learned the latter. The Evenflo pump just sucked. (or didn't suck!)I called evenflo. They have a 90 day warranty, so I was able to get a $50 voucher. But had trouble finding something that I wanted from that company, but I am pleased with how they handled.RENT A GOOD ONE. DON'T BUY THIS ONE."
1,Total Waste of Money!!!!,"I registered for this pump. It worked great for about 2 weeks, then the suction just stopped. I called customer service and they sent a new one out right away, but other things began to fail. The milk backs up in the valves and I have to bang the unit on the sink to get the milk to fall through to the bottle. If you don't, the milk backs up into the unit and leaks out where the a/c adapter connects, potentially causing other seious problems. Please do not buy this pump!"
2,Get what you pay for,"The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" really applies to this pump. It was painful to use and didn't express adequate milk. If you only want a pump to use now and then and don't want to spend the money on a Medela, this one will work just fine. But, if you need a pump for regular everyday use, this one is not a good choice."
1,a BIG hassle and a piece of junk,The pump worked great at first. Dealing with all the small parts and the milk backup wasn't really a hassle until the burnt the motor out. Then I had to purchase a new pump. Then that one burnt out within 3 weeks. Now on my third one I wish I had saved some money instead. Now this one works at a snails pace. And the warranty only covers the pump for 90 days. This pump will make you feel like giving up so please save your money and purchase a Medela.
1,not a good buy,"- i bought this pump expecting it to be easy to use and portable for when i go away and am unable to breastfeed my daughter. not only was this pump uncomfortable to use but it broke already. the motor makes a horrible sound and its hard to get a good suction because you have to get the parts on just right or it doesn't work. This is very painstaking and annoying. because the part that broke isn't covered under the warrenty, even though its only been less then 3 weeks, i'm out fifty dollars, which i could have used to purchase a better pump that may have cost a little more. in this instance you definately get what you pay for...junk."
5,Great story!,I really did like this book. It tells a good tale with an interesting storyline and well-developed characters. There is true wartime heroism here but book is not gory or unnecessarily graphic.It also gives you a view from both sides but without preaching or becoming moralistic.If you want an easy-to-read book with a good story to tell then I recommend it.
2,not recommended,"kind of lame. good footage of some fine reggae folk, but poor quality of some clips and a bit light on the bob marley (which would be ok if it did not say 'bob marley' in huge letters atop the cover. i've had it almost a year now and i think i watched it twice(the second time only because i forgot it was lame after a while). looking for an awesome live marley dvd? try 'Bob Marley and the Wailers: The Legend Live'."
1,Bob Marley: Heartland Raggae DVD,"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. THIS EXPOSE POSSESSES ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF AN AMATEUR PRODUCTION. THE SOUND QUALITY IS HORRIBLE. THE VISUAL IMAGES LACK THE ARTISTRY SO DESERVING OF THIS ROCK/REGGAE ICON. IN FACT, YOU SEE VERY LITTLE OF BOB MARLEY. I THINK THIS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF A PRODUCTION COMPANY'S ATTEMPT TO CASH IN ON THE MARLEY PHENOMENOM. MARLEY, AND HIS FANS, DESERVE BETTER. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE DVD COVER. IT HARDLY CONVEYS THE MAGIC OF THE MUSICAL GIFT THAT IS BOB MARLEY."
4,Reggae History lesson,"It amazes me how clueless people are about Jamaican culture, Rasta culture and what Bob Marley truly stood for. This video should be required viewing for all students of roots & culture.It's kind of old & funky. Great coverage of some early concerts including Dennis Brown & Bob Marley."
1,Leaves it unclear as to how we can be sure of anything,"This book has a very heavy cultural emphasis and its writer has a disdain for the use of ""proof texts"". It is so reliant on culture that at times it appears to make the scriptures into a subjective text. It even goes as far as referring to Christ's teaching in the Gospels as ""hyperbole"". However the conclusions are that divorces are to be made official, that the innocent victims should be treated as other singles and that the guilty should be encouraged to repent and then to make reconciliation if possible, so it captures some of the emphasis of Christian teaching, if not all its detail. The book has a tremendous amount of notes, as any cultural/historical work must, but there is a danger of pushing people towards the line that they can only understand the bible on divorce if they understand all the history and extra-biblical sources - which is a way of restricting the truth to academics and priests."
1,I would give it 0 star if I could,"It is so questionable these harsh words and the way that orthdox Christians understand them are really from Jesus's mouth. It is so simplistic and so out of line with Christ's character. And do you know how many people emotionally and spriturally died because of it. And the Church said ""if only you be obedient with the commandment, you will get your eternal reward after you die. Talk about behavioral control!"
3,I don't care what your daddy do,"This is a good collection of the McCoys best recordings from their Bang Records days. Unfortunately, some of these songs aren't that good. Sure, ""Hang On Sloopy"" is a great song, and some of their other songs are good. But some of their songs sound like an average high school garage band. But if you do want to have a McCoys CD, this is the one to get."
1,Does not play on Samsung Blu-ray players,"Watch out! (1) TopGear: The Great Adventures 3, (2) TopGear: Apocalypse and (3) Clarkson: The Italian Job Blu-rays DO NOT PLAY on my new state of the art Samsung players. Both of my NEW Samsung Blu-ray players are up to date but they complain about changing the resolution of my NEW Samsung TV. It is interesting to note that TopGear 14 and TopGear 15 play stunningly!!! I will be sending them back for exchange or refund. I would prefer an exchange as I ""love"" TopGear UK""."
5,"If it works, its unbelievable.","Did not work in a newer Toshiba Blu Ray. Got the Blu Ray to work in an old Samsung BD-P1500, and it is great... The South American adventure is the best they've done so far, and they threw in a commentary by James May, as well as Bonneville and Romania. Necessary addition to a Top Gear collection, and nearly worth finding a compatible Blu Ray player."
4,american made monster,"Although this book is does not take a sympathetic approach to McVeigh's story, it becomes pretty apparent how McVeigh may have been lead astray. He was abandoned by his mother, had an emotionally detatched father, etc. Shows both sides of this tragedy. The tragedy of the bombing and the trajedy of McVeigh's disenchantment with America; especially after he was treated like a human guinea pig by the army. Very interesting book, I couldn't put it down."
3,Solo Guitar,"I wasn't particularly impressed by this book. It was also probably because I wasn't expecting it to be a guitar/voice book. It tries to pull all the parts into the one guitar part that they give. I'd much rather have all the parts written out instead of a mishmash of parts. Plus it messes up a few areas in terms of chords and even song structure, leaving out a good bunch of the actual guitar solos from the album due to lack of a backing band. It's all music notation (which is better for rhythm than tabs) and the only tabs are in the chord symbols above the guitar and voice part. The book itself is great in terms of artwork and design. If anything it can be a nice little coffee table book to flip through and check out pictures of the band recording and playing. If you want just the guitar part that is on the album though, you're probably better off looking it up online for the tabs and filling in most of the solos by ear."
5,Not for the faint hearted,"This album is for the head banger. For the casual listener, there is no way in. But since this is about the book and not the album, here's a bow shot: There is no tablature in here. So if your skill lies in reading music, this is the place to go but don't expect any fret numbers laid out for you neatly to go home, have a few beers and play along. I doubt if Gilmour himself will be able to play along this stuff considering he cannot read music. Additionally, here's a bit of trivia for you. The outro solo on Pigs on the wing - Part 2, was crafted and executed by Snowy White and not David Gilmour, as is usually thought. In conclusion, this is one of PF's heaviest albums and worth learning to read notes to play the stuff. Have funRK"
3,"If you read French, this undoubtedly will be useful.","If you read only English, maybe you shouldn't go to France in the first place. But if you are bold enough to go without being able to converse in French, you probably will want a guidebook that you can read, and this is not it."
5,Must Have - Truly ACCURATE Information !!!,"This is an accurate assessment of hotels and restaurants. The icons are easy to understand, and once masteared you can easily and quickly find excellent accomodations and meals that will not dissapoint. If you've ever been frustratead by the exaggerated and inaccurate summaries from all of those bargain a day Europe books, you'll really appreciate the Michelin guide."
1,Poor connector,I had to use electrical tape to keep the coupler connected to monster gold cables as they fit loose and did not hold.
2,great for a while,"I purchased this Calphalon pasta fork, along with six other Calphalon nylon utensils of the same type, 18 months ago. For the first year I was really pleased with them. However, in the last several months, the grey silicon insert on the top of the handles of two of these utensils (the pasta fork and soup ladle) have separated from the rest of the handle. The inserts could be snapped back into place the first few times this happened, but now they will not stay properly inserted, which results in both utensils having too much flexibility (not to mention they no longer look nice). I fear the same will happen with the rest of my Calphalon utensils. Although the silicon insert is a nice idea, it is poorly executed, and I am now looking to replace my pasta fork with a one piece version."
5,Calphalon Nylon Pasta Fork,Great pasta fork to complement my other fine Calphalon kitchen utensils. Also is a good solution to gently cradling and rolling raw eggs into pans of boiling water without breaking egg shells.
3,Adapter for microphone (hosa gxj235 1/4 trs to xlr male adaptor),"Works, but had to tape up because it had some play in it that caused some problems. Works good now."
3,audio connection,Works fine BUT picks up a low hum...but hum not there when using other XLR connections
5,Works as described,"Works well, I have no complaints came as described. I use this to run a direct signal to my mixer"
5,Well made does what it should,"Title says it all. Good materials, good quality construction. Works as it should. What else is there? Other products have flimsy construction or pitifully cheap materials. This one suffers from neither condition. Buy with confidence."
5,Great product,This is a solidly built adapter that is compact and works great. The connections are tight and noise free.
1,Terrible sound quality!,"Avoid or you'll be sorry! The sound quality is stunningly BAD! Richard Chadwick vocals are absolutely horrible ! He sounds like my cat whining when he get sick! Dave Brock ,after releasing the terrible sound quality past cds Complete 79, Choose Your Masques 1982, Live Glastonbury 90 ,etc., and now this horrible sound quality cd , you have now driven off more fans ,including this one,than even Dave Anderson did with his numerous re-issues of the horrible Yuri Gargarian CD . Last time you fool me for my hard earned money!"
5,Very convenient and so easy to use...,"This is so handy, just plug it in, and it auto syncs, charges and even tells you when to disconnect...very convenient, very easy to use.."
4,Great album!,"I have a couple of other Om releases and this one is probably the best one. Lots of chill out lounge tracks that make you nod your head and enjoy the moment. Conflict Resolution by Joey Youngman is rediculously the best track on the album!! All in all, this cd is worth spending the money on."
1,Don't waste your time,SUPER KUNG FU FIGHTER- I am not going to even waste my time reviewing either of these movies. Super Kung FU Fighter stars Meng Fei and Carter Wong and has a very tired storyline. The action is decent at best. Rating- 1.5/5FOUL HERO- Chen Kuan Tai has a fight at the start and that's the best scene. The only reason I kept watching is because one guy looks a lot like a young Rongguang Yu (the guy who played the Iron Monkey). But by the end of the movie I was convinced it wasn't him. Probably because his fighting skills are so bad. 1/5
1,A WASTE!,"A waste! Not only is it not in english, the fighting is lame! Don't waste your money! Even though it has recognizable charecters, its totally boring. The only thing that saved it from the trash is the insta action feature that allows you to just watch the fights"
5,Perfect for Turtles,"I use this stuff instead of carbon and it works like a charm. It keeps my turtle tank crystal clear, the best part is it comes in a bag so no mess."
2,Not worth the money,"This product is no better than the cheaper filter mediums in my humble opinion. It is supposed to be re-usable after it gets dirty by sanitizing it with bleach and then soaking it in a de-bleacher to make it safe for the fish again, but you will have to go through the hassle of getting supplies for that, and then hope you get all the bleach neutralized so you don't kill your aquarium. I would not buy this again."
2,Overpriced and Overstated performance claims,This product does not meet the stated performance claims of clear water. It also claims you can re-use it but I wouldn't trust soaking it in bleach and then putting it back in my aquarium with the little fishies! I will stick with charcoal to be safe.
2,Not impressed,"I have tanks with this product and without this product. There is no discernible difference between them. Water quality and clarity are the same with or without. As this stuff is pricey, doubt I will be using it again."
2,Not impressed,I bought this after seeing reviews raving about it. My tank was still having a new tank haze after about 2 months and several partial water changes. After 2 days of this being in my filter the tank just got more hazey. I wont be purchasing again.
5,Won't run my tank without it,"When it comes to keeping excess nutrients and other not so great stuff under control, we as Marine Aquarists do our best, but at times things just get away from us.I consider Purigen to be my chemical balance insurance policy. It won't do much if your salinity is out of whack, granted, but as far as phosphates or other nasties, it'll do so much better than carbon ever could.And, if you trust yourself to treat it properly, after the grains have gone from white to very brown/black, you can bring it back to life with a chlorine soak and then a chlorine neutralizer.But then, at 1 bag per 100 gallons, and $9 (my local fish store wants $12) and Prime shipping, why not just get new and remove the risk of chlorinating your fishy friends?If you're on the fence, try it, you certainly won't regret it and it really can't hurt anything."
1,White residue and loose beads building up inside the aquarium walls and plants,"I didn't anticipate the beads and a white residue (even through I rinsed thoroughly) to leak through the mesh bag. Today I noticed that my spunky little beta was barely moving, then saw there was a white residue building up inside the aquarium walls and little white beads all over the plants. Just did a water change two days ago, and am uncertain what to do at this point. Purchased the Seachem Purigen 100 ml bag for the Aqueon Evolve 8 LED Aquarium Kit, 8 gallons. The water has a white/cloudy appearance. Put back the original filter for this new aquarium, and hoping that will clean some of this out with the help of the air bubbler which moves the water very well, but gently."
4,Does it's job.,Really does add that extra buffer to water to make things crystal clear. I recommend this product for use in mechanical filters.
3,I guess it helped?,"My tank is no more clear that before I used this product. I had a small white haze in my aquarium and it is slowly going away but I believe it is from better regulation of the light and using a filter floss. The purigen is obviously absorbing something ( it is slowly turning brown ) but I won't be using it again, its just not needed if your tank is established and running smooth as is.Do some research before using the regeneration steps as I've read about using certain slime coat water conditioners can cause the bleach to remain inside the purigen even after rinsing/conditioning."
5,Fine Collection,"For those who like this band this is a much have set. Unfortunately, this awesome box set is no longer available new on amazon. You can get it on itunes for about $35. That's the original price."
3,"Fine audio, poor DVD","I am a fervent fan of DCD, owning all of the albums and related soundtrack work. I also own the VHS version of the Toward the Within concert.Needless to say I was excited to hear of this boxed set release. Unfortunately there are only a few extra audio tracks that I did not already own.The DVD was the biggest disappointment. I expected a quality video transfer and a remastering of audio. Intead the video quality is only scarcely better than the VHS, and it is NOT remixed into Dolby Digital. Instead, most of the sound sadly comes from the center channel in Pro-Logic mode.If you are new to the DCD scene, then this is a worthy buy, it will get you the gist of DCD without having to buy all the CDs.In contrast, if you already have a large DCD collection, decide if the extra tracks are really worth your money."
5,10/10 Excellent for my size 8 regular Allen Edmunds Copley,"I got these at the same time when I got my Allen Edmonds Copley dress shoes. This size small fits perfectly into my size 8R. If you got shoes that are 8 and smaller, this size is it. Great cedar smell and great quality."
5,Execllent shoe tree,"Best shoe tree that I've ever used. The solid, full-toe design reduces creases without widening the shoe."
5,Superb product (and Difference between Right and Left),"This was my first pair of shoe trees and I have to admit that I did not know much about them. However, these are really great in quality because they are made out of hard wood which is the type of wood you want if you want to absorb all that bad moisture in your shoe. Good quality stuff.A note about Right and Left. To distinguish them (there are no labels), you have to look at the shoe tree from the end (from the heels side). If you do that, you can clearly see that for each shoe tree, there is a enlarged side and a smaller side. The enlarged side is supposed to be where your big toe goes. Hope that helps!!!"
1,"Quality construction, poor design","This is a well made, but poorly designed shoe tree.You can't get it out of the shoe because the hand hold to remove it pushes the heel into the shoe harder instead or releasing the pressure. This makes it impossible to remove. I ended-up putting a knob on the top that I can push in the right direction to compress the shoe tree and remove it."
2,Copycat...,"This book constantly reminded me of ""Gone with the Wind"" only this one had great love scenes. I found myself skipping through the boring dialog just to get to the steamy romps in the hay.Other than that, I would prefer to rent ""Gone With The Wind"" instead of reading this book again."
1,One Rode West,I never got thi s book I was told by my Kindle to go home and reeorder. Idid and got a sample. I want to buy the book for my Kindle what do I do to purchase this product?
3,Strayed from the historical story.,"The story would have been worthwhile if there was more to the story of the Indian involvement at that time.However, I'm not a prude, but the detailed intimate interaction between the main characters was excessive. I'm sure it was no different with married couples then or now. But, it would have been worthwhile if the story focused on history of the area and not on the sex. And to think Lady Chatterly's Lover was banned in Boston.There were numerous typo's and even names which were wrong in the book as it progressed. Inter-mixed Callie and Crista. Maybe the proof reader needs to proof better."
5,"Greg Dulli is the master of lustful, dreamy and dark rock...","Greg Dulli is the master of lustful, dreamy and dark rock and his new Twilight Singers endeavor, Powder Burns is a fervent roller-coaster ride. Opening with an industrial thrill, this collection of songs drips in an icy, cool and seductive vibe. Always keen on employing talented collaborators, Dulli includes exciting guest work from Joseph Arthur and Ani Difranco among others. Tinted with a graceful layer of hope and a great bit of that expected sophistication, Powder Burns smokes through haunting ballads and turbulent, bittersweet rock numbers with unshakable vigor.Standout Tracks: ""There's Been An Accident"", ""Dead To Rights"" -Antonia Santangelo"
5,The 'salutatorian' of Twilight Singers albums,"Excellent song writing and great music abound in this release. I jokingly refer to this as the Twilight salutatorian because I believe Blackberry Belle is the groups 'Valedictorian' and major achievement. This album is solid throughout, with great tracks that have shown up on tv in places like episodes of Rescue Me (the Dennis Leary show on FX). The songs are well crafted and years after original purchase, I still enjoy the tracks."
5,Best Sounding Whigs/Singers Album in a while,"I've been a huge fan of the Whigs/Singers for a long time, ever since their days of playing Bogart's in Mount Adams. The ensenble represented on Powder Burn really hits their stride in a very tight, very complete musical composition.I'll admit after the first two Twilight Singers albums came out, I was pleased with the sound, but it wasn't all there. The next slew of albums had poor production quality and didn't appease me.This album re-affirms Dulli's commitment to putting out a solid product. If you're a fan, this needs to be in your collection. If you're new to this sound, put this on the short list along with Gentlemen and Twilight as Played By The Twilight Singers."
4,chop rider,"Dark?!?!?! The recording of this album was interrupted by one of the worst catastrophes to occur in the US! A place the singer calls home. Do you think he was daydreaming about 5 foot waves, beach fires, Abercrombie and Fitch swimsuits and whistlin Beach Boy songs as he witnessed rotting corpses and his town in shambles upon his return? Do your research before your next impulse purchase.The TS cont to be one of the most underrated bands of our day and Powder Burns is another Strong recording. I love Dulli's return to rock on this album. The only reason I gave it 4/5 was b/c I thought Blackberry Belle was a little stronger. This could change after a few more listens to Powder Burns.And the live shows are where it's at. I see that Lanegan will be catching up with the tour soon and DiFranco will be joining in NOLA. Don't miss! Get there early for the openers."
2,This sucked,"If Dennis O'Leary is a friend of theirs (after promoting this CD on Comedy Central) he should send them some new guitar strings so the band members can garrote themselves. Talk about a bunch of ""songs from the darkside""...Jeez, all I can say is if you want to be depressed, go ahead and buy this."
5,A Rockin Doob Bio / music video.,"Hey all i have to say is this video is great , i love it not only do you get complete bio by all the members that have gone through the doobies , but very cool clips of shows etc . i just wish this title was on dvd . so to the powers that be, please release this one again out on dvd or release the V-H1 one in any case this video rocks. rock on tommy & pat & others. A fan."
3,"nice design, poor implementation","product looks good (pretty) and is sturdy enough, but half the pieces didn't have holes drilled for the screw inserts and the other half did. not a big deal, just REALLY annoying. made the assembly process a two person job that took 30-45 minutes.also, screws were very cheap. once in and once out and it was stripped."
1,Nail Trimmer,"The balde in this has a tendacy to fall out and get dull very, very fast. Spend a little more money and get a better quality trimmer."
4,"Easy to install, but not easy to remove",Pros:* Easy to install* Quite sturdy* Looks good (for the price)Cons:* Not easy to remove
2,Flimsy,"We bought this gate to separate our kitchen and living room for a dog and a baby/toddler. The space is 42 inches, so we needed an extra wide gate. This gate seemed flimsy; the metal did not seem sturdy, and we were concerned the pressure mount would not hold well if our older children tried to climb over it or pushed on it too hard. The latch was also very sensitive. If the gate was mounted too tight it was difficult to open, but if it was too loose the gate could be almost pushed open without much effort. We returned this one and we're still searching for one that works for us."
3,not good for large openings,I needed a gate that would work for a larger than normal doorway and this is ok but not very sturdy. Would not recommend for a big opening.
2,"Great height, easy use, not strong enough.","The extra tall gate was perfect height for my 2 yr old who is 36"". She broke it within a months time, by banging and pulling on it. The latch could not withstand her strength. I also didn't find it secured well enough since it does not have the capacity to be bolted into the wall. At the time it cost us $70, and I was unable to contact anyone from the company for a replacement or refund. (We had thrown away the box!)"
2,It seemed promising at first and less than a month later it's falling apart,"We purchased this at another store, but I wanted to make sure people knew the issues surrounding this gate. We did a hard install on the bottom step of the stairs. Initially this gate seemed perfect and easy for me to use. I wanted Mini-Me to be able to open this without issue and after a few minutes of showing her and practice she mastered it.Less than two weeks later we were having issues. The gate secures at the bottom and top- and the top clasp does not secure itself even when you try to help it. I wish I hadn't purchased this gate."
3,"Swing stopper broke, company was no help","I used the gate for 3-4 years with two kids. It was very difficult to do the pressure mounting and positioning especially because of he difficult and slippery access to the turn knobs. The latch was so-so, if you find the exact millimeter how much the extend the turns it will lock but it never felt fail-safe.After 3 years the swing stopper developed a crack which became worse and worse until it failed. The company was no help, they said out of warranty, tough luck. I'm used to better treatment by other companies, if I call them that some small part broke I always get replacement parts usually for free.I could have used the gate for one more year.I think the stopper should have been made of metal and that SummerInfant should learn to carry replacement parts."
5,Great Gate,I tried several gates for a high traffic area and had to return a couple. This one was perfect. Opens and closes easily and very tall.
3,Does not include cups for mounting at top of stairs,"Although this is a very nice gate, we were upset when it arrived and we found out that it does NOT include the cups needed to hardware mount the item at the top of the stairs. These are available on summerinfant.com and cost an additional $9.99. The description of this item needs to be clearer so that others are aware the hardware mounting cups are not included."
3,opening is narrow,"I will say that this gate is the only swinging gate I have found that is secure but my older children can still open it to get through. It also doesnt look as junky as alot of the other ones.However- the actual walk through opening is rather annoying as its very narrow. About 20 inches maybe. My laundry basket doesnt fit through and because of the bottom bar that sits on the floor, it is also harder to get your vacuum etc in to where you want to go. If you are used to moving a pack n play or exersaucer or the like through the doorway, that will be very difficult as well.The height of this gate is 36 inches which makes that even harder since you have a higher gate to lift your things over.That said, the one I just purchased is sitting here- and Im not quite sure wether to keep it yet.You would think that by now some manufacturer could have made a perfect gate."
4,Worth the money,"I first had the Safety 1st pressure-mounted gate, which was plastic. I love Safety 1st products, but this one didn't work well for us. So I purchased this Summer Infant gate and it works like a charm. We use it in an extra-wide doorway between our dining room and kitchen to keep our dog and cat out of the living room. We didn't even need to buy the extra attachments. The metal is very sturdy and actually much nicer than a plastic gate. It was easy to install. The lift-up mechanism works easily and is perfect for one-handed use, and the magnet at the bottom of the gate is a great feature. However, our gate doesn't lock into place all the time after swinging shut and we need to give it an extra push to lock it in, but that is no bother. In fact, it makes us double-check that the gate is really shut, which we should do anyway!"
1,cheap made,"Been using this Gate for a very short time and the plastic hinge is already broken, not happy with it at all!!!!"
1,"Not childproof locking, hinges break easily","As others have said, the locking mechanism is totally defective, it just opens if you bump on the hinge. Also, the plastic hinges on these door are very fragile, they will break within few months. I went through two doors already, first time it broke within the 30 days of purchase. The replacement door's hinge broke three months later.Don't waste your money, spend $20 more for a door that will actually work."
1,Don't like it,"I completely agree with ""Returned it in favor of Hands Free Gate"" by Brian. What he said was so true, I would like to add that it makes a loud squeaking noise when ever you open or close it. We can hear it through out the entire house! Also my son, who was 13 months at the time, he was able to shake it- and it completely fell down! Thank goodness that he did not get hurt! It is nice that it is tall but to me, that is the only good thing about it!"
5,Great Gate to prevent toddlers climbing over!,We bought this gate to prevent our toddlers of climbing the gate to get where they want to be even though they shouldn't be there. We had a swing gate before this one and they learned quickly how to climb it! For their safety and my peace of mind we spent the money to buy this gate and it works! No more climbing over the gate especially at night to get in bed with us. Mommy and Daddy need their sleep with out extra bodies in bed with them! :) I recommend this gate highly even though it is somewhat pricey! Watch Toys R Us for their baby days and they usually give some money off! We saved $5.00 today! Hope this helps you to make a decision weather to buy this gate or not!
4,Gets the job done,I purchased 2 of these to close off a part of my house to our puppy. My 5 yr old and 8 yr old can open it with no problem. As others have stated is does close a little loudly but nothing I can't live with. It doesn't take much to knock it out of alignment and I believe part of that is the banging shut. If it is not perfectly aligned the metal rod in the bottom of the gate bangs on the bottom of the metal frame pretty hard. I have it as tight as I want it without doing damage to my walls. The adjustment is very fine to where is closes perfectly. A hair or so off and it can make it so it does not close cleanly or completly. Many time I simply have to push on it and it open. This is great for our puppy as it can't push it open since it opens inward toward her. For kids who know how to pull this could be an issue. Overall for the price it is definitely worth the money.
3,Great but...,This gate is wonderful for the top of our stairs. It keeps the dogs from running to the front door and over crowding our guests. It also keeps them from sneaking down there to go to the bathroom. The only issue we have with this gate is that it doesn't truely swing closed. It does automatically close behind you but doesn't latch...so you still have to turn around and latch it yourself. The other issue was during assembly. This gate was so difficult to put together that we will never buy it again. But...after it is mounted into the wall it's great. You just have to get past the painful assembly process. You will need two people with this one. Preferably atleast one male or strong female. It does it's job and atleast it's not plastic and so i know it's not going anywhere. We will get another gate for the top of our stairs on the third floor when my baby girl starts walking...but not this one...something similar though.
3,my dog knows how to open the gate....,"Great gate--have an earlier version by the same manufacturer as well. However, in less than two minutes my Jack Russell terrier figured out how to open the new gate and get out. I've nicknamed her Hannah Houdini."
4,Just purchased...,"OK,This gate was the tallest available at our local Babies R Us store. That's really the best thing going here. Our two chihuahuas are now safely kept away from our living room furniture.I like that the gate has vertical bars instead of any sort of mesh. Also, I don't see too much of a problem with noise. All in all, this gate works because it seems as though it's the tallest one out there."
5,"Good Gate, But Costly","I had to purchase 2 of these gates and yes they were costly, but at least it came with two extensions already included in the price. I originally purchased 2 of the hands free gate, but after I realized I would have to buy 4 extensions, I quickly returned them and got the sure and tall gates which saved me $40 in the end."
2,Seemed well made but did not include hardware,"The product was delivered promptly. The package did not contain the hardware packet identified on the inventory list. Therefore, the gate could not be assembled and had to be returned."
3,Started out great... but....,"The gate was great at first. We had removed the rail from our 2 year old's crib and set up the toddler bed. We wanted a gate to keep her from wandering the house at bedtimes. It worked great! I liked the straight bars (no foot holds) and the hieght of the gate. But it only lasted for 6 months. She watched how everyone would open the gate and then said ""look mommy, I can do it too!"" and proceded to push the locking pin back and lift and open the gate. She is now 2 years and 11 months and there isn't a gate yet that she can't climb over or open."
2,Bad quality.,"The price of this gate is affordable, but the quality is not very good. After just 3 weeks of using this gate the latch almost broke off from tugging upward(which is necessary to open the gate).it takes a lot of effort to try to open the gate with one hand, so I have to use both hands which still takes quite a bit of effort... Which would probably be good if you have an older child and you don't want them to get through. But it's hard for me because I'm usually carrying my baby while I'm trying to do it.Also, the gate is wobbly and you have to use screws to screw in the ends and we can't make holes in the walls here.When the gate arrived one of the bars were bent the opposite direction that they should be.If I were you I would get something less flimsy..."
2,Not the gate for us,"This gate just does not do it for us. It needs constant tweaking to ensure that both the bottom and top locking apparatus are capable of being engaged. You can't just swing it shut to lock either. It is a very frustrating gate and we will be replacing it shortly. We do, however, like the wall caps that it came with to put the pressure mounted rubber stops in, we feel it adds security that our big little boy can't just fall into it and knock it down. I wish they sold these separately but they don't unless you buy a twenty dollar parts replacement kit..."
1,"Unrealible, easily broke, hard to install","I do not understand why people like this gate. I found it incredibly hard to install because everything had to be just right to enable it to auto close. I had to use two different levels and even with that it broke after about one week and failed to auto close. Even when it did work however I found it to be rather loud and cumbersome. Plus, there is too large of a gap between this gate and the wall and before you say use the extensions, I did use the maximum amount of extensions I could fit but my baby can fit her head though the gap! overall with all the problems I'd say this is the worst gate ever."
1,Poor quality,"I set this gate up at the bottom of the stairs in my house, but from the start, it didn't feel very sturdy. The metal parts are nice, but the locking mechanism is mostly plastic, and made very poorly. I have needed to tighten the gate at least once each day during the four days it has been installed. If it is a little loose, it pops open with a little shaking, which my 18 month old has already done. We are shopping for a new gate."
2,"Ok, while it lasted","We bought this gate and used it for about 4 months; my son was an early walker with a fascination for our stairs. After 4 months of use needless to say it's now sitting out in our garage. Main complaints -1. Gate hinge is REALLY noisy, which is okay I guess because you could always tell when someone was using it - LOL! Not so good when you have a sleeping infant & you're trying to sneak out of the room.2. The 'auto close' wore out after a month so you had to constantly make sure it was secure.3. The latch is the hokey-ist thing I have ever seen! My 13mo old figured it out in .2 seconds, seriously a slide tab? There are toddler toys with better latches!So we're off to shop for yet another baby gate, another $60-80 down the drain!"
4,Works good for me!,"I must admit it took awhile to get it installed right and level, but now it works great to block off our entire kitchen. The only thing we had to do was spray some wd-40 on the hinges so it didnt squeak."
1,I hate this baby gate.,"I thought this gate would be perfect for us. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. The cup mounts (so that it could be screwed into the wall) were not included. It can't be used in a doorway that has moulding along the bottom. It is extremely difficult to install correctly, and equally difficult to open and close when it is correctly installed. I certainly can't open it one handed, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone with kids of varying ages. It might be fine if you have a dog, as long as it isn't a big heavy dog that likes to jump up. It might also work if you need it in a low traffic location. However, for us, it was a complete bust! Thumbs down!"
1,bad design,"The locking feature is a bad design that if pulled hard enough (by my two year old) it will just come undone. I feel that I totally wasted my money, but to return it would have cost the same as what I paid."
1,Does not work in certain opening sizes falling within the advertized range,"I just watched this thing fall down our stairs for the 10th time, and it tried to take my wife with it. In the mounted position, the gate is so wobbly that even the slightest touch by our daughter will cause the side bolts holding in place to cave in and fall down the steps, rendering the gate useless. The latch mechanism also stopped working after just a few days. I admit that the opening we have is an unusual size (slightly wider than a standard door opening, but not big enough for the extension provided), but clearly falls within the advertised range. Unless you are using this with a standard door opening or one with the precise dimension of the extension, not recommended."
2,Good Product,"This was a nice gate but when I recieved it, it was rusty. So I called Amazon and they reimburst me."
2,Cheap plastic lock/poor customer service,I purchased two of these gates and one had the lower locking pin broken right out of the box. I contacted Summer customer service and they told me to return it to where I purchased it ot another dealer who sells thier products. I did return it a vet another gate.after 20 days the locking pin on the other gate broke also. I no longer have the boxes they came in and to have the item repaired will require the entire gate being replaced as the locking assembly is installed with rivets. I have to pay shipping back to Summer for the warrenty to be used.This is poor customer support as I must pay additional out of pocket for thier poor design.
1,It breaks!,"This gate WAS great for about a month and then both of our gates completely broke. The joints that held the door together completely cracked. There was no trauma to the gate, just normal everyday use. I cannot believe that this happened in only a few months. The scariest part is when it completely popped off when my daughter was holding onto the door. Thank God she wasnt standing at the gate on TOP of the stairs."
5,baby gate,we use it for our two 2yr old girls. we have the upstairs blocked off so we can get some things done and not worry about them running off and faling down the stairs!
2,"Not very durable, wrecked after 6 months","I have a wide entry into my kitchen so it's difficult to find a walk-through gate to fit. I bought this one in 2009 and it lasted 3 years. It broke slowly. First, it wouldn't self-close and then the plastic around the hinge cracked. In August, 2012, I bought the same gate because I could use the old mounts on the wall, because I'm so limited on my selection and because 3 years of heavy use seemed okay. I think they have since cheapened the product. The self-closing feature broke within the month, one of the parts to help it stay closed broke within 3 months so any toddler can pop it open and, after, 6 months, the plastic around the top hinge cracked causing the door to fall away at the top. (I duct taped it for now.) I plan on contacting the manufacturer but I am torn. Even if they replaced my gate, I don't think it will be any better than this one. Very disappointed!"
1,Never stayed latched. Not save!,This gate worked for about a week. And then the latch started to loosen up. Now it never looks. Threw it out after about 2 months.
4,Needs adjustment from time to time,"This gate is great. It's nice and tall and very sturdy. However, I have to adjust the bottom to sync with the top lock from time to time. Once adjusted it locks automatically when you close the gate."
2,Doesn't Auto Close,"This gate is difficult for one person to install. And no matter what I do. I can't get it to close automatically. Not a problem for me - I have gotten into the habit of latching it when I go through it, but my wife can't seem to develop the habit, and so, it is left open half the time. We use it to keep our dog in one room, so it's not a safety issue. But whenever my wife goes out of the room, the dog gets out because she leaves it open. On the plus side, it opens in both directions. I just wish I could find a gate that really closes automatically AND opens in both directions."
2,Do not recommend,"We bought this gate at Lowe's because it was the only walk-through gate they had. We just bought a new house and needed an extra gate. It is not self-closing, as it claims. When my huband first installed it, it would not self-close at the top or the bottom. When it swings to close, the bottom part of the gate hits the bar and bounces back. My husband fiddled with it, and now the top part will close on its own, but the problem with the bottom latch remains. It has to be pulled closed. I gave it two stars because it does seem to be secure once you manually close it. My 20-month old daughter has shaken it, and it has not come loose. We haven't had any problems with it being hard to open for us, as some have, or with our daughter being able to open it because it's too loose. I recommend the North States self-closing gate. It is more expensive, but it is a much better product. You may have to buy additional extensions to get it to fit your opening, though."
2,Not so great gate.,"I bought this gate for my medium sized dog with a propensity to jump over all the lower gates. It worked great for awhile, but as my dog would jump and put his paws on the gate, it would move. I had to tighten the gate every other day just so it wouldn't fall down (which it would sometimes when I didn't). If it wasn't just right, it wouldn't close by itself, which meant my dog would get through. Also after awhile of it moving bit by bit, it put small holes in both sides of the wall. After awhile one of the sodered points just broke. I fixed it with mighty putty for awhile, but eventually it went into the trash. Not worth the money it cost. Would never consider it safe for the top of the stairs. Wouldn't even use it around my baby boy now that we're babyproofing."
3,does the trick but not as sturdy as I would have liked,"It definitely works fine and we are going to stick with it. It is relatively easy to open and keeps the kids on the side they are supposed to be on.I'd say mounting the compression cups to the wall are a requirement, not optional. It definitely wouldn't be sturdy enough without them.For the price I was hoping for it to be a bit sturdier. I guess you have to spend $100+ to get super sturdy.But like I say, it works good and we're going to keep it."
4,Overall a great product. Quality craftsmanship.,This is a great double boiler but I only have one pan it fits. Pan depth really has to be considered. From the lowest ring just above the bowl shape it is 3 inches. The opening across the top is around 8-1/2 inches. I would like to see them redesign to fit a larger assortment of pots and a counter balance to the handle would be nice to minimize lean. A good accessory they could build for this would be a basket type holder to set it in.
5,Best double boiler ever,I had one double boiler but it was small. I like the fact that this one is very deep and it has pour spouts on both sides which makes it easy to fill jars with my jellies.
5,Double boil 2 quarts no problem,"Purchased this to make yogurt. A regular 2 qt. double boiler is too small, and this fits 2 qts. with an inch to spare from the lid. Fits into a large sauce pan- I have a Revereware. And a great value..."
4,Almost Perfect - Back for Another!,"I use this double boiler for my small business, melting down raw ingredients for body care products. I have used it 2 days per week for 8 months now and it has worked beautifully in conjunction with a mini crock pot. My only complaint is that it isn't counter-balanced well. It takes the slightest nudge to tip it over. To fix this, I attached two metal curtain rings to the hook and that keeps it balanced. This is really not to much of an issue since I pour and return it back to sitting in the crock pot. I'm back today to order another one!"
4,These blades do a satisfying job,"After seeing the ads on TV and reading some excited reviews here, I was expecting a tremendous job from these blades. Alas, they only do a satisfactory job.Pros: good looking, less streaks, easy installationCons: not quiet, doesn't completely eliminate streaking even when brand new, and shiveryBottomline: not a breakthrough in wiper blade business"
5,High quality and long lasting,The day I put these on I noticed some small lines as if they had gotten small nicks in them. I don't know what caused this but these wipers ended up being the best I've ever used. They lasted a few months over a year before they started to get streaky and needed replacement. I didn't replace them with the same thing but I got a great deal on a competitor's high end wipers and selected them instead. When they are done I'm likely to come back to these Bosch wipers.
3,More sales related,"Good information, good concepts. A bit repetitive and more oriented towards a sales/marketing perspective than general management."
4,Another Outstanding CD,"Rickie has once again graced us with an outstanding project. While not quite a five star rating it is very good. Rickie plays many instruments on this project and handles them all very well. His vocals are underrated and his overall view of what a good song contains are evident in this CD. Rickie mixed and produced this Cd (along with Tim Austin) and the list of pickers reads like a ""who's who"" in bluegrass music.This is an excellent follow up to Rickie's first solo CD and I recommend both of them for anyone who likes Rickie's music or bluegrass in general."
4,a book every breeder needs,"Im a cockatiel breeder. I recommened this book, to anyone breeding or just wants a pet cockatiel. This is a excellent book, he talks about alot of things many other, cockatiel books, dont say anything about."
1,Broke on first use,"I tried two of the 5 punches on a normal leather belt. Both punches pushed thru the center retaining ring rather than the leather. In other words, they broke and cannot be replaced. This product is made of inferior metals and not able to withstand the forces required to punch leather."
2,Not So Strong,"I bought this to punch extra holes in my belts to provide more freedom. The problem is that when I had more difficult belts to punch the handles bent under the pressure from my hands. Now the unit is broken, only because of my hand-applied pressure."
5,The very best beginning voice and speech text,"As a theatre arts professional and University Dramatics instructor, I cannot recommend this text enough. Although it has not been updated since 1988, the information contained in this book is invaluable to any student interested in the field of voice and speech improvement. Having been a student and collegue of both Dr. Seidler and Ms. Bianchi, I can only sing the praises of these two professionals, and commend them on a textbook which speaks to students and professionals alike. As a voice instructor in the California State University system, I still use this text (my old university copy) to lecture from and as my primary source for materials. I have also shared it with countless other voice and speech professionals who also deem it as an indepensible resource."
4,good old time music by excellent artists,all the songs on this cd are representative of good bluegrass as well as good ol mountain music for those who enjoy it.
2,buzz?,"Used this to connect my instrument mic to an LR Baggs preamp. After about 2 uses noticed a buzz in our amplified sound--suspect it's coming from this connector, since all the cables are shielded and since the LR Baggs preamp works well for all my friends' mics (and no, the buzz isn't feedback or improper settings in the preamp--the buzz goes away if I touch the preamp/connector)."
2,Looks good but not sturdy,"I purchased this microwave 3 months ago and everything looked really good. But it is not sturdy. Panasonic has used very flimsy cheap parts and here is a list of things that broke within 3 months.1. The light inside the microwave gave up within a month.2. The plastic parts of the door started cracking and now there is one part of the door completely cracked (used super glue to stick it together).3. The lock is made of a very cheap quality plastic and they have a spring mechanism which is attached to another plastic piece broke and now i have replace the entire door.It looks good, cooks good but most of the parts are made of cheap quality plastic. If you are planning to purchase this product, be ready to make frequent parts replacement."
3,Here are the sizes....,"I have this item on my registry but have not tried it yet with a baby (which is why I rated it only 3 stars). However, I did find the sizes of the pads on another website. They are listed below:Quilted mattress pad: top cover - 100% polyester, bottom - 100% vinyl; 28"" x 52""Large crib pad: 100% cotton flannel; 27"" x 36""2 lap pads: 100% cotton flannel; 12"" x 14""Hope this helps!"
4,Useful set,"I had no idea how useful this set would be when I registered for it. It's reasonably priced and the pads are attractive. They have washed up very well, and they definitely have needed lots of laundering! One of those indispensable items that makes a practical and thoughtful shower gift."
5,use them all the time!,"I use the smaller pads on my changing table and as my portable changing pad in my baby bag. I love these! They are much more compact than any padded changing pad or quilted pad. Since I am traveling with enough stuff for twins, I really need to save the space in my bag. But also I've been using the smaller pads on my changing table since they were born. Just a small shield between baby and the terry pad cover allows me to launder the small pad rather than constantly laundering my terry changing table pad every day. When they were infants and peed all over the table, I just had to change the small pad (so I kept alot of them) and now that they are nearly out of diapers, I still use them for shields on the table when dipaer clean up is a real chore. A real time saver when I'm washing the pads not the entire changing table linens!"
4,Great set..,This is a great set that washes very well. The small pads could be a bit bigger but other thn that I like it a lot.
1,This is a terrible study guide &#65533; do not buy it !,"I took the California general contractors B exam in August of 2002 and failed the first time I took it using this book. The book does not even cover several important sections, such as Electrical, plumbing and handicap codes. For the other sections, less than 50% of the material they covered in the book was on the test.If you are taking the exam in CA, do not use this book."
4,Excellent,"Garage rock is one of my least favorite musics. I respect the impulse, but need more dynamics.So I Want Candy by the Strangeloves impressing me shows how strong this album is. The title track--its really ""Willie And The Hand Jive"" on steroids-- with big beat and deliciously infantile demand is amazing with its hooks. This song does not use a lot of instruments, but the band makes a big roar, makes you instantly believe they want whatever the ""Candy"" is. We are all screaming babies deep down, brats that want that sweet stuff, and want it NOW! This is rock with its rebel boots in full shine. You instantly relate to this song, and it reminds why we have such a visceral love for rock and roll.There are a lot of covers here: ""Satisfaction,"" ""Land of 1000 dancers,"" all imbued with volume and kicka-s joy. You gotta love a rock band having so much fun on rock voltage. Even if you don't like garage, this candy is sugar sweet and power packed and pretty soon, you'll be woofing down a lot of it."
3,A fun recording,"Some fun tunes from a more simple time in music. Many great memories. The band is often remembered for only ""I Want Candy"" but you will hear some other tunes that come across the airwaves now and then."
4,"I would give this 5 stars, if I hadn't seen the group live","This is a great album. Seeing the band live is even better, however. I searched out an album by the David Grisman Quintet after they performed a concert at the university at which I teach. This album will get your heart pumping, your head bopping, your feet stomping, your fingers snapping, etc., but if you ever get the chance to see this group perform live, especially in front of a college-aged audience, DON'T MISS IT. As good as the album is, the live performance is even better!"
5,Pushed me in a new direction,"I was, and still am, a be-bob jazz lover, but when I heard this album, a new world opened up. Call it what you want, but this jazz/bluegrass music is some of the best ever. All the elements of great music are here. Regardless of ones taste, this has to rank as one of the best recordings ever. When I have people over of various musical taste (ok rockers mostly), this music always leaves an impression. It is truely unique."
4,"Not sure what I took away, but I cherish it.","Was this film about aging, the disappointments of life, thwarted ambitions, longing and emptiness, our legacies, etc., etc.?? All I know for sure is that I saw some great acting from an intelligent, coherent, sincere script.So I was completely satisfied...and you will be ""glowing"" at it too."
1,Writing written rote,"Starting Out in the Evening is slow going. Read the previous reviews to recap the story. I found it sullen, slow dramatically, and despite good acting from Langella and most of the supporting cast it lingers on the fringes of real insight and real story action. Moment after moment is false. Ambrose is too pushy and her performance falls flat. What is there to say about a script that takes many scenes to get to contrast and lingers in perhaps perhaps perhaps for too long. It's coma producing. The result is a film that no one really wants to see. Just some promoters of the book, perhaps. Ignore this film if you can. Look at the grosses. No one went. Don't you ""go."""
1,Left me speechless,"Nubile college babe strokes geriatric Jewish heart patient/once-hot author, causing him to have a stroke; meanwhile, author's obnoxious, unattractive 40-year old daughter, fresh off a binge of cheap sex while secretly trying to get pregnant by some poor unsuspecting schmuck, shacks up with a non-committal black narcissist who previously sent her to the looney bin, and at the same time opines that Dad's relationship is ""unnatural"". Many tedious scenes of author napping, eating slowly, typing, soiling his pants and even climbing out of the tub with gross old rear end in plain view. Oy vey!"
1,This was a manufacturers error. Seller was not responsible,"The GPP-146 is a one sided crank. It is not the item shown. If you're looking for a connector with two 1/4"" jacks -|_ this isn't it. Apparently the manufacturer packaged the item incorrectly and the seller was not at fault. I responded negatively and a bit hastily. The seller has corrected the problem."
2,The pedals never seem to lay down flat,"I really wanted to like this product, as I am a ""neat freak"", especially when it comes to the pedalboard routing. The problem is, there never seems to be a pedal combination where this allows the adjoining pedals to be even with each other and/or flat to the floor. Really wanted to like and use it, but it's in my adapter drawer now..."
5,Sunday Sax,The discription of this product was just right. It helped me make me want to purchase it right away.
5,Trash to treasure,I thought this was a different book. But the service was fast. I would buy from you again.
3,Children might enjoy,"I wasn't blown away by this book, I looked through it when it arrived, the stuff it showed to make just wasn't my cup of tea. It did have nice pictures and detailed instructions. Would be more for kids to do."
4,For the advanced to beginner,"I loved this book! And even bought one for my best friend who wanted to get her feet wet in crafting. I have used the pop bottle idea for many gifts and the christmas ornamate wraped in netting you get from fruit turned out so pretty! Oh and of course the stepping stones,I have seen them in the stores for 20.00 or more andto think they can be made for a fraction of the price! I could go on and on. My friend is making the stepping stones, as well as the address plate for her house, just to name a few. We will both be buying many of the books by this author and look forward to each new one."
3,Fun projects for kids,"This book is a great way to introduce kids to recycling. The crafts are easy and fun to do, but they are something for children. There are only a few that are really nice enough for adults to give to another adult. As I said though for children this book is one of the best I have used. It has plenty of cute ideas for used cans."
5,What can I Say,It has wire and a molex connector. Isn't it ridiculous how you have to enter a minmum amount of words to give a product review. Makes you not want to leave a review.
3,Kind of cheap,"One of the connectors was not socketed correctly to the 8-pin headers. It was a simple fix, but I expect at least functional work from products listed on Amazon."
4,The Arthurian legend for very young children,A brilliant and gorgeously illustrated retelling of the Arthurian legend for very young children; even kindergarteners or first graders could appreciate its stately but simple language paired with Hyman's magnificent pictures.
2,Broad Overview,"I found this book to be very broad with little focus on the actual battle. While well written, I was disappointed as I felt like I learned very little by reading it."
3,Good period piece,When I purchase martial art movies staring Carter Wong which is rare I really gotten use to not expecting much from him that continues to hold true with this film. The reason I brought this is because I do like Roc Tien and if you are familar with Hong Kung actors this film does have an all star cast the fight scenes are good not great I loved the costumes and settings only a 3 star effect.
2,love the music but the quality is bad,"I love the music, however after each disc was played about 8 times, it stopped working. It would play a high pitched hum. Tried moving to a different disc player, still hummed. Very disappointed. Can I return them?"
5,oldies but great,The best Do-Wop collection I have ever owned. Would recommend this to anyone who loves old ROCK-N-ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Some great Christian music,","Dallas Holm has one of the best voices in Gospel music. I first got hooked on the Live album and quickly found this one. I have always liked Rise Again, but I Saw The Lord and Here We Are are two songs that rank up there with his best This CD does a good job of looking at his earlier work. I'm just waiting for a CD that does him justice after this period."
1,Disappointed,"Gave this as a birthday gift to my wife. Her response ""it was janky"" not like the picture. Really bummed that I wasted the money."
5,What a neat book!,"I was a little apprehensive at first, afraid that there might be a religious or moralistic agenda behind it, but there's none of that. Instead, we're treated to a fast-moving romp through one of the most utterly significant periods of man's history. Our ""hero"" seems to find himself cast by fate into virtually every important event of the time, hobnobbing with movers and shakers both historic and religious. One could even study history here! And what a fun way to do so, since the tale is told with a twinkle in the eye. A great read!"
5,A lot of fun,"I liked this book. The plot was familiar but the characters managed to make it unique. Hellion was a rake but he possessed a genuine understanding of his failings and a ability to laugh at himself. Jane is capable of forging her own path, without the assitance of others, but she still has a hint of vulnerbility.The chemistry seemed to work well and the romance was sweet without being cloying.All in all a good read."
3,I guess you either like it or you don't,"In reading the reviews before I purchased this book, I almost didn't buy it, but I decided everyone is entitled to their own opinion. It wasn't the greatest book I've read, but it wasn't the worst, believe me they are out there.Anyway, I liked Jane, she was self-assured and strong in the areas she was most comfortable in and those that made her second guess herself, she became her own worst enemy. I liked Hellion, he was your typical rake. This is a good read, two lonely people from different sides of the social spectrum, finding each other and falling in love. I guess that's what we all wish could happen."
1,Cheap Chinese DO NOT BUY,Made in ChinaChinese rigging and climbing equipment should never be trusted. Black Diamond is based in USA and makes all products in China. Beware
3,One for the price of one.,"""A Matter of Life and Death"" is one of the greatest films ever made. I lost interest in the other one (what was its name?) after about 10 minutes. Thus the three-star rating. It's too bad they couldn't have bundled ""Life and Death"" with ""The Red Shoes"" or one of the other Pressburger/Powell masterpieces. That would have been a real bargain.The quality of the DVD is fine; the color (and black and white)images are just as I remembered them."
2,Dull pair,"The Age of Consent is something of a nudie flick, pointless, and dull. Mirren looks better with her clothes on. Stairway to Heaven starts out well and then becomes a loooong series of sermons based upon a truly absurd view of heaven, justice, and love. Yes, I know: these pictures are lauded by critics and shown in art theaters and ""fillum studies"" courses. Please, spare yourself the expense and boredom."
4,"Thick and handy, good protection","I love this pouch - it is thick and handy. I have Canon 60d DSLR with 28-135 zoom. It fits just right, but I need to stretch it alittle to fit the lense. Neaxt size is 6x6.5x8, and I think it would be too big. Overall I love it, and going to carry the camera it the backpack."
4,"Some protection, little cost","I have no complaints about this neoprene sleeve; it is solidly built. It is not going to provide a whole lot of protection (you wouldn't want to drop it), but it is really light and adds very little volume. I'm often toting my camera along in a backpack or shoulder bag, and I feel a lot better about doing so when it is in this sleeve. It provides a little bit of shock protection, good scratch protection, and good dust/dirt protection (you never know what you'll find in my backpack). It fits my D90 with either Sigma 10-20mm or Nikon 18-105mm lenses on them (which is just under 5"" long). When I lost the first one I bought, I immediately replaced it."
1,Just what I was looking for...,"I have a Nikon D90 with an 18-135MM lens. I have a good size camera bag but wanted something I could use to protect the camera on hikes and on trips--when schlepping the camera bag was not an option. I tried padded stuff sacks, but could not find one large enough. This product fills the bill perfectly. It's lightweight, fits like a glove, and was very inexpensive. Two big thumbs up."
3,"Should be called ""Whatever we could get""","A very mixed bag -- basically what Willie owned the rights to and what they could get cheaply. Usual Rhino nearly-unreadable tiny-type-on-black- background booklet -- good text in the booklet though. His first two singles are very good. Unreleased tracks interesting. One can see why the Hank album was not released -- notes say it was done very quickly with people who were hanging around. Music Hall selections are OK -- a little rough. Like one published review says: ""There's no compilatory rationale whatsoever..."" Glad I got it but was somewhat let down."
2,The other reviewer is right on the money,"Besides heartily seconding everything Makarov9 has said, I might also suggest ""Colloquial Hebrew"" as an alternative written resource (I haven't heard the accompanying audio) as it has basically everything that the Teach Yourself book is lacking, & also the Pimsleur audio-only course, which unlike other CD programs has a good balance of repetition & new material, and having finished it I found myself with quite a decent repertoire of Hebrew which has, over the past year or so, remarkably stayed with me."
1,Where's the Hebrew?,"The cds are excellent, the material in the book is good, however, the Hebrew letters are too small to even try to read or write. Plus the font used for the Hebrew causes one to wonder if it is even Hebrew. Unless you like using magnifying glasses and know enough Hebrew to figure out what the letters are, you may want to purchase an other product."
3,Teachyourself-modern hebrew,"The characters in this book are not so clear and not easy to be read,especially the part of these vowels."
1,Won't support 275 lbs,"I'm about 215 lbs, and was sitting on the stool when it suddenly collapsed. The plastic section the legs go through broke in half."
4,"C'mon, Eddy, smile! You've done great!","This is a fine overall collection of Eddy's best songs. My favorites are still his biggest U.S. hits, ""Electric Avenue"" and ""Romancing the Stone."" The remake of ""Baby Come Back"" (on which he sang lead with The Equals ca. 1967) is not bad aside from the fact that he's slightly off-key on the chorus. Unless you're from the U.K., I suggest skipping the first track, that terrible remix of ""Electric Avenue""; had it been my decision, I would have ignored it and included the 1983 12-inch mix of EA and would have put all songs in chronological order instead of randomly as so many record companies seem to get their jollies by doing nowadays. But if you don't care about such trivialities, by all means grab this interesting and fun- to- listen- to CD. (But please pay for it first! :-)"
4,Romancing the Stone,"Eddy Grant did the title track to the movie ""Romancing the Stone"", it's always been one of my favorites from the eighties. Including his hit ""Electric Avenue"", I enjoy a song written for his African brothers, ""Livin on the Frontline"". It's about the need for Africans to stop killing each other in pointless tribal wars, still true today. It's a great album."
4,A musical visionary.,"Eddy Grant's groundbreaking and innovative fusion of R&B, Rock, Reggae and African rhythms made for some truly unique music--the best of which is anthologized here. Although most of Eddy's original CDs are currently unavailable this CD gives you some of his best tracks while proving just what a musical visionary he was. My omly complaint is that the ringbang remix of ""Electric Avenue"" is unnecessary filler material--especially when the vastly superior original version is featured here."
3,"You'll like the original's,","You read right. If you couldn't tell from the listening samples, some of these are original recording's, some are the original artist's, but, not the original recording's. Of the 12 song's, I'd say, 7, maybe 8, are original's.Even some of the re-recordings are done very well.Its not bad for the price."
2,Not what i was expecting...,"The quality of the DVD is terrible. Looks like a home video recording. But apart from that, it was very cheery and funny, and the songs were terrific. I do love Collin Raye and Lorrie Morgan."
1,The Abused Hero,"I hate to slam a book this severely, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who found it sensationalist, inaccurate and generally sloppy in small or large features. Like her I was annoyed by the many untruths with which the author built up his tale. Why build around a real person, Colonel Robert Shaw, only to abuse his known character, his possible motives, and the wife, parents and friends who in reality did surround him? According to many historical records these were all people of integrity; you'd never know it from this romance. Far better to pick a purely fictional person and start over, leaving Colonel Shaw alone."
1,Suntan tub,I have only used a few times on our lake. It's great to use but is not durable. It already has multiple holes in it so I'll be throwing it out.
5,LOVE,"Bought this to use in our mini blow up swimming pool just for sunning purposes and it was almost too big for the pool, but did fit. I love the size, and the edges that keep water out. It's so comfortable, I just love it. Also had no problems with leaks."
3,Not Bad but disapointed,"When I first got it i was pleased with the size and shape of the net. Setup was not to hard took about 30 minutes by myself. The secound day i was hitting the ties at the bottom got ripped off. I was very dissapointed about that but thankfully I was able to retie them more securely. Overall this is a good net for the price if you really want to invest in a net I would suggest choosing something a little better, but like I said for the price I paid it is a good net. This is only my third day using it so I'm inerested to seeing how it holds up the next few months"
2,quality just so so,"When I first got this and set it up I was very happy with it even though it's a little wobbly. The size is nice. I use it for a backstop when I catch my daughter pitching softball. The only problem is when you leave it outside in the wind, it tends to get blown over,(even with the stakes hammered in the ground). After repeated blow-overs, the aluminum tubing starts to bend and twist making the net even more wobbly. I tried to screw the tubes together so they would'nt twist so much, but after a good wind, the net just bent at the corners. Again, the size is great and the price is right but the manufacturer needs to use better quality tubing."
2,Very flimsy,"The net is actually easy to install and setup, didn't take long before I was hitting some balls. I anchored it to the ground with the included anchors and used it for about a week. It felt flimsy the whole time and it did fall over every now and then, it just wasn't sturdy enough but it was acceptable. Unfortunately we had a windy night (not very windy though) and by the next morning the net was completely ruined. The poles were bent, that is when I realized just how thin the poles actually were and how structurally unsound the whole pole structure was.I definitely would not recommend this product especially if you want to leave it outside and don't want to worry about a breeze ruining your fun."
3,Kind of Fragile,"My husband purchased this and I think he broke it within the second use. Plus, it isn't meant to leave outside; the first time we had a windy storm it looked like it had been left outside in a hurricane. Overall I guess the product is ok if you don't plan on using it very much and take care to store it."
1,poor rating,This is the worst golf net that I've ever purchased and do not recommend it to any one. Waste of money.
3,It's okay,"It's okay, once I got it together, it does the job.It needed a couple more tie downs, to be secure...."
2,Guady,"My daughter, age 13, got this in pink for a gift . Besides it being gaudy, it has a big face and for my daughters small wrist, it doesn't work. The worst part is that there are no numbers. It should at least have a mark at 12, 3, 6 and 9 to help tell the time."
1,The dial big!,"Th watch looks fine, but beware the DIAL wide and is much above the average size. The picture shown here is not representative of the dial size. If you are looking for a women's watch with a huge dial then go for this. If not I wouldn't. I returned mine back to GUESS."
4,Nice Watch,I love the fit of this watch on my hand. I have my reservations about the feel of 'quality' of the band (very stiff) but it is overall a nice watch.
5,The Ultimate James Taylor Collection,"Don't make the mistake of settling for the edited ""Best Live"" collection. This has more than twice as many songs, & is well worth the extra money. It has almost 3 times as many songs as his ""Greatest Hits"", making this the definitive JT collection. Combining folk, rock, country, blues, (& humor), it's a very entertaining, must-have release."
5,James Taylor Live,Does it get any better than this? I don't think it does! James Taylor will always be remarkable and remembered as one of the most influencial artist of our time.Thank you Sweet Baby James!Les
5,A stage side digital deck is super clear.,Every one has been to a JT concert. Now you get to hear what you didn't while you were at the concert. Time has changed some of the presentation. But this is the best live CD I own.
2,Murders his hits,"I have a feeling these live shows are a lot more fun live than this recording would suggest. Here, the 1993 big band sounds a little like overkill and James kind of overdoes many of his best songs, adding all kinds of new notes and swoops and hollers that are fine as part of a live show, but which you don't want to hear again and again, as here. The essence of JT is simplicity, but his treatment of his catalogue here is a little too ornate. I would stick with original albums or greatest hits if you only need a JT sampler. This souvenir is for rabid fans who already have those and who want a live recording sample."
3,good 1 bad 2,"I 've seen JT in concert and it is great. I think that this album was arranged wrong the tracks just dont flow. I also think what makes james taylor so great is his ability to have just a guitar and sometimes a piano and sound amazing. This live version puts to much modern s@#t into his music and the backup singers werent very good. Disc 1 sounds good but disc 2 is painful to listen to. They ruined ""walking man"" which is one of my favorites and Mexico dont sound to good. Unless you like that stuff not a good buy"
1,A Cure For Insomnia.,"I bought this with high hopes, but the nauseating in between song banter had me reaching for the sick bag. i know there are only two reviewers who think this album stinks (me being one of them) but for me this album came across as the worst sort of bible belt music; a happy clappy, feel good sort of affair but totally failing to uplift. The songs are all over the place and inconsistent in quality. I found this record dull in the extreme, so tedious my eyes shut long before each side had completed. A cure for insomnia. Sorry James, I know you suffered for your art as a young man, unfortunately as an older man its me doing the suffering."
1,Loose Connectors,"Very disappointed with this adapter. Both ends are the wrong size. The XLRF end is too small in diameter. It is very loose when I plug it into either my mixer or any of my outboard equipment: I'm going to have to tape it.Even worse, the 1/4"" TRS end is too deep. When I plug in a TRS cable and push it all the way in, I get no sound at all. I have to back it out about 1/4"" to get it to work properly and prevent it from shorting.I've never had problems with HOSA's equipment: this is a first for me."
4,Very interesting,I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this presentation. Giles' study of Napoleon's life from his decision to give himself up to the Royal Navy to the decsion-making and attitudes in England towards his disposition to his internment at St. Helena makes for engaging history. Utilizing many first-hand accounts the narrative is easy to listen to and a very good product.
3,A decent read on Napoleon's final banishment,"This is quite a decent read on the treatment Napoleon received at the hands of his ""...most consistent and generous foe, the British"". A balanced account is what Mr Giles has stroved for and the coverage is generally admirable. Napoleon's jailer comes across as a more humane person than history has given him credit for.I din't care much for the last part of the book which focussed on various poems written by great men of letters to explain the Napoleonic myth as I felt that such coverage was either too narrow or irrelevant to the overall British perception of Napoleon."
5,Value Priced Effective Solution,"For what it is, this PC Card Ethernet adapter does the trick. In my case it was installed in a friend's aging laptop that is running Windows XP. The enclosed drivers installed with no trouble and in minutes he was hooked up to my WAP.Despite my concerns about a manufacturer I'd not heard of before, it works well with excellent range."
2,Scratch this one off your list!,Frustrating and disappointing. Coating is difficult to scratch off without tearing paper. Plastic parts are flimsy. Read several on-line consumer reviews if you are considering purchasing this item.
3,Weight on bottom falls out,"overall, these are nice chess peices, but there is a weright placed on the bottom of each peice and they are coming out of mine - which are only a few weeks old."
4,Thinking outside the box,"First of all, please don't confuse this with creationism or any other non-scientific theories. This book (among other things) reevaluates the commonly held understanding of evolutionary theory. There are just so many unexplained findings; artifacts that don't fit comfortably into our commonly-held views.Anyone who is interested in the ancient world, human and non-human, as well as possible alternative views of human origin, should read this book. It asks more questions than it answers and that is a good thing."
5,One of the finest of the Tiffany's!,Bona fide American grade A western swing at it's finest as far as I'm concerned!This stuff is timeless! Oh to have been in Tulsa and Fort Worth in the 40's! A MUST!
1,"nice ""glitzy""jack","If you are looking for a jack with Nascar glitz this is for you.It is lightweight, sturdy, nice. If your looking for user friendly and practical its poor!.The handle securing nut is a poor screw on type,and not spring loaded, it also stands approx.2"" above the listed hight.So if you have a low clearance(sporty)vehicle forget it! its too high!(ironic).Also One needs to have about 45Deg.of vertical motion on the handle once the pad contacs the vehicle in order for the jack to lift it. I do not know who engineered this jack but they must have had rigid limitations.Nice for flash not for gas and go."
3,surprised,"Two things I'm not happy with - The jack is alot heavier that I expected, and it is made in China, and I hope that Nascar dosn't use anything made in China! I like many Americans prefer to buy American and create more JOBS here in the good old USA! The adds for the merchandise should indicate - "" MADE IN AMERICA """
2,Average adapter,"This adapter is alright. I wanted a 90 degree adapter because the headphone jack on my laptop is right next to where my mouse goes. I was constantly hitting my headphone cord with my mouse. This adapter solved that issue. However, after just two or three months, I noticed some crackling sounds. I can jiggle the adapter a little, and that solves the issue. If it gets hit again though, it'll crackle some more.I'll probably look around for a better adapter."
1,Kept falling out on the 2nd day,"On the second day of using this, the female end no longer gripped onto my headphone jack. This is garbage."
1,Useless,"Very poor quality. Causes volume loss and static when installed. If you twist the connecrion you can occasionally get adequate sound quality, but as soon as you bump the connection, the sound volume drops."
2,Not a tight fit,I plugged this into my Galaxy Note II and the fit wasn't snug enough. The sound kept crackling in and out. I have since switched to all bluetooth all the time.
1,Didn't work for me -- too loose,"I bought this adapter so that when I use my smart phone in my car, which has the headphone/aux cable adapter on top, I could turn the aux cable so it comes out sideways instead of coming out veritically and having to make a big turn on the way to my car stereo aux input. I found that this adapter kept connecting and disconnecting as I drove, so I can't use it."
4,offbrst of avenues,"this is a fantanstic CD, in typical style of Manhattan Transfer.I take adult tap and we are using 2 songs from the CD."
5,Rhythm of the Avenue,"Just buy it. You have to hear it for yourself. (Not for people who love living and thinking in boxes)-------UPDATE-----------Looking back the first review is no help at all. :-bSeriously this is a funky, toe tappin, head boppin jazz album for people who are scared of jazz and jazz lovers who also enjoy a little pop music. This is the album the group split created right after they regrouped from doing the ""solo thing"". You can hear the diff compared to their old stuff. MT is known for being funky and silly e.g. Twilight Zone, Trickle Trickle, The Shaker Song. You still have all these elements but with a mature flavour. Most of the tracks have the traditional funky, offbeat sound and lyrics the group is famous for while others are soul tapping ballads that are much deeper and thought provoking e.g. Gentleman with a Family.MT is hard to describe. The must be experienced to be fully appreciated."
4,"The Offbeat of Avenues, The Manhattan Transfer","This is one of my favorite Manhattan Transfer albums, not their best but one of my favorites."
3,First Serial Divided Over Five Discs!,"This is NOT the 1950's TV show. It is another transfer of the public domain serial Dick Tracy from Republic Pictures made in the mid thirties. The transfer is okay, but I already had a copy from VCI, so I just gave this set to my Pastor and his sons to enjoy. So if you are looking for the early fifties TV show, this isn't it!"
4,Fascinating for math-phobes,"As someone who struggled with math all through grade school, college and grad school, but who somehow still finds numbers fascinating, I found this a great read. I learned more about mathematics and how it is relevant to just about every aspect of life than I ever learned from a ""teacher"". In the innocence of my educated ignorance I enjoyed the book. Alas, had I known of all the egregious errors found by another reviewer, I'm sure I would have kept reading it so I could carp about it. Let's just hope I don't pass on this new misinformation to my children."
5,"Great movie, just like the books",Only thing bad is that it is only 15 mins long! My daughter LOVES this tape. We watch it over and over again. Great fun. Toad is hilarious.
5,a very clever video.,"This is a short video which is early claymation, but still very good quality. It is short, comprised of three stories. It is very professional and discerning parents (and librarians) should appreciate it. This is one of my kids' favorites."
5,Sacred Trust,"I have read all of Meg's books and this is one of my favorites. It was well written, kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me wondering. I'm already looking forward to her next book!"
5,Sacred Trust,"Extremely well written. Kept me in suspense all the way through. Excellent. As an author, I would love to contact Meg personally. Keep writing Meg."
4,Overpriced - but it works!,Too much money for a piece of plastic - but it does the job.Don't forget that trapping snow melt means you are stepping in a puddle (or mud) when you enter/exit your car
1,"Definitely not Jazz, but is it music or Shtick?","I don't like writing bad reviews, but I am quite disappointed in this CD. It made me think of and his analysis of the improvisational fake. This CD was scattered and confused compositionally. I was searching for pulse or rhythm of any sort, but it was rigid and noisy. There were some textural things that were quite mundane to me and redundant appearing to compensate for the violin players poor improvisation. The poor use of instrumentation, and the skill level of the players appeared low. I appreciate Kang's attempt at violin, but all in all, this CD was self indulgent and pretentious at it's best. I recommend the player's and composers of this release read Charles Mingus's ""letter to the Avant-garde"". I vote zero stars."
1,READ WARNING LABEL!,"In small print (very small print!) on back of attached paper label reads:""Warning: his product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""There is no indication if the whole product is made from this chemical or what the dangerous chemical is."
1,Really Slow Honda's,This video is so bad i cant possibly describe it! There was not one car that could run a 14 second quarter mile. Dont buy it!!!!
1,"A poor choice, wish I had my money back.","The author frequently uses illogical unsupported and misleading arguments. I simply felt that she was working far over her head and was not familier enough with the related subjects such as magic, alchemy and history to be writing about it. The book is full of misconceptions and poor logic and is simply not appropriate for new students. If your looking for a good Jungian Tarot book, look at Lee Irwin's Gnostic Tarot. Much much better"
5,Very good book,"Very deep study of the Major Arcana of the Tarot. the author is well knowledgeable of what she is talking about. Gives a new persepective, more throughout than all the newagie psycho-blable we are fed with."
2,Jung or old stuff?,"I am a Tarot reader and a Tarot book author. Everyone goes on and on about Jung and Tarot - and in reality, if Jung wrote all of 12 pages about Tarot in his life - that is all there is. He was not a Tarot reader nor did he use Tarot in his analysis. Jung ""mentions"" Tarot.If you are expecting in-depth explanations of the Tarot translated from 'the mouth of the Master' - well, you are going to be disappointed in this book. The 'archetypical journey' in the title is not anything Jung wrote about - it is a journey created by the author."
2,Beginner's french,This is only the book and they link it to cd's that were not included. Very hard to buy them online. Nevertheless the method used is very intuitive and easy. It's well organised and give you easy access to this beautiful language
2,Top 100 bitter people!!!,"I recently got this book and lent it to a friend who picked Irene Hughes to call and paid to speak for 15 mins and all this lady did the WHOLE TIME was yell at her and treat her like a child(""are you stupid,I will not answer that again). Proceded to tell her things that were not true,which made her cry. This was not the first time this has happened w/a name from this bk and I feel this bk did not weed out the fakes and nuts. I have not called all 100 but, this bk needs to do some better checking before it claims for these people to be the best."
4,Joyce Keller 100 points****,"I beg to differ with the other reviewers. I used this book and found the gretaest psychic of all, Joyce Keller. I was totally blown away by her reading, which was upbeat and positive the whole way through. It was as if she knew me and my problems, and answered each one explicity. When she told me I as going to marry someone I knew named ""Ed<"" I denied knowing anyone by that name. Nonetheless she was very sure. Sure enough, I did know an Ed, he was a coworker of mine. We kno longer work togtehr because I am expecting my first child, and Ed, is my husband. I love this book for helping me find Joyce."
4,"Ok, not great","I have read with Jill Dahne and I was quite disappointed. I've had other readers give me a lot more detail about my future love life and much more accurate timeframes.I have spoken to Jill twice. The second time she read for me she gave me a time frame which was 3 or 4 years later than the time frame she gave me the first time she read for me, when I asked her when I'd be getting married and meeting my soulmate. It was really confusing.She seemed confused about who she was seeing as well as the timelines. I have just had other readers who were a lot less expensive and give me MUCH more detailed info. and much more accurate timeframes. Was really disappointed.I do, however, recommend Stacey Wolf."
4,A Good Book,"I use psychics quite often, and to my surprise, the one I use quite often was in there. Kim Allen, who I believe is called the Love Psychic is noted in the book. With her in the book, I have even more faith in the book as a reference. I believe that she is not only accurate, but after hearing her on radio and seeing her on television, I felt that she was living up to her name. Her predictions were right on the money, and I have been using her for about 10 years. She has made a difference in my life. Even though I do not want to stray from what I know best, I feel comfortable to be able to travel the country and experience new psychics. I am always looking to learn something new; especially about myself. This book is highly recommended as far as my standards go, and I am sure that no matter where a person lives, they will find the right psychic for themselves. Good luck!"
1,Jill Dahne Was Wrong,"I went to see Jill Dahne and she told me that I would marry someone tall with dark hair, very nice and in my same business. I was going to do this 2 years ago. None of it has happened."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is a waste of money. Half of the psychics in this book are no good, many are deceased or the contact information is out of date.Google a few of the psychics in this book and you will see they are frauds. A much better book is by Hans Holzer: The Supernatural: Explaining the Unexplained. He names the top 7 psychics in America and I have been to a couple that I found through other means and they are amazing."
4,Only Importance..,"The only important part of this book, is Kim Allen the ""Love Psychic"" based in New York. She is accurate, inexpensive, straight to the point and extremely friendly. If you buy the book she is in it. TRUST ME, if you want a psychic that will NOT disappoint, read about and contact Kim Allen.-JD"
4,Better clear your calendar b4 reading this book.,Because you are never going to put it down. Once I opened it I never shut it until I had finished. It's very gripping and emotional. I would have a kleenex handy while reading. However I was saddened by yet another of Kelson's near brushes with happiness. That boy has the worst luck with women. He needs to find a nice girl to settle down with. Anyway I think it's about time for Katherine to get us off the edge of this cliff. We need the the next book. Please write the next book. Please?
3,"An enjoyable read, although not her best.","Volume 3 of the 'Histories of King Kelson' is an enjoyable read, with the same complicated, interesting characters as the rest of her series (and the one before). I wouldn't say it is as well written as some of the other books, the plot wanders around a bit in the middle, and the section with the Servants of Saint Camber seemed a bit pointless. I still found it hard to put down as the characters are so interesting I couldn't wait to find out what had happened. Still, after five books (including the three in 'The Chronicles of the Deryni'), you have made a bit of a commitment to these characters anyway. That is the other caveat to this book, you really need to have read the previous books in the series first."
5,A good perspective for today's world.,"""Your God is too Small"" puts things in good perspective. It is a must read for this day and age, although it was written in the '50s."
4,Evangelical Book,"Good information, with one minor doctrinal issue at fault. Overall an excellent tool for clarity of Christian thinking about Who God is to us as human beings."
2,ONLY ONE MERIT,"The only merit in this album is that features Randy Rhoads. And you keep wondering how a guitarrist playing these silly, cheesy, pop and commercial ""metal"" songs could hide inside himself the genius later revealed when he played alongside Ozzy Osbourne ... Amazing ! The songs in this album are glam of the worst kind, wiht a few good chorus along the way."
2,A showdown for Randy!!!,"Thanks God Randy Rhoads joined Ozzy Osbourne, to show the world his unrivalled mastership of the guitar, introducing a whole new era to this instrument. Because, in this QUiet Riot, their music is horrible, cheesy, a kind of WHitesnake mescled with Poison, but less creative!!"
3,Just TOO basic...,"I made the mistake of ordering this book without first reading the reviews. I admit I was regret when I received it and start reading it. The contents cover everything but just too basic. If you have the knowledge of buying and selling SFH, you basically do not need this book. Save your $20."
3,A book of dreams,"Fine if you're a multi-millionaire. But this road to riches isn't for someone who doesn't have, as Gordon Gecko would say, enough cash to piss in the tall grass with the big dogs."
3,The Basics,"This book is an easy read, but those who considered it the ""best"" real estate book out there may have been rotting their brains on no money down schemes (this book thankfully notes that beginning investors will not find a no money down investment property deal).If you are looking for Real Estate Investing 101, this is a good choice.If you already understand Cap Rates and NOI, and are confident in your ability to estimate the value of a property based on its financial statement, then pass on this book.All in all, the book is good but basic. Unfortunate that the tables presented in the text are not explained fully--the author prefers, I think, to sell you the software separately."
3,Good beginners read. Beyond NOI and CapRate? Look elsewhere,"This book devotes a fair amount of time on valuation from a beginners standpoint. Overall good, easy and quick read. The case studies and examples appear a stretch. The author suggest that the sweet spot is to find a property with 20% vacancy, a few minor cosmetic issues. It then claims that that by leveraging a 80% LTV, the owner, in a short period of time can increase the vale and sell for a healthy premium. Hmmm... I want to see Steve Berges try this in Chicago or New York metro areas.As a relatively new property investor, I found the book useful and would recommend to others. I purchased and downloaded the software at thevalueplay.com which is adequate to complement the book's instruction bias. However, buyers beware, these are password protected Excel spreadsheets with macros and without the ability to add formulas, change things here and there, they are useless."
3,"Beautiful star, not so great movie.","I gave this movie 3 stars only because the star, Isild le Besco, is so beautiful. The movie itself is only okay and kinda boring at times. I would still recommend it just to watch such a beautiful young actress."
3,the lesson,this is a (B) movie that is ok and it teaches you that you shouldn't mess with anyone when you are married or with a young in the mind person they can't handle the matters of the heart.
4,Excelente novelA,Coloca al lector en un ambiente que probablemente nunca se hubiera imaginado y que es muy probable que hubiese sido el escenario real del hombre delas cavernas. Sobreabundacia en los pensamientos religiosos de aquellos si bien tiene una acepcion interesAnte.
4,Hansel and Gretel: An Appalachian Version,"One of the most eerie versions of the classic Brothers Grimm tale is set in the Appalachian mountains during the time of Depression. A father and stepmother cannot afford to feed their children and therefore they lure them into the woods and make them lost. When they come upon a decorative log cabin, they are enchanted by a creepy witch who locks Hansel in a cage and sets Gretel to work as a servant for her...and the rest as they say is history.This 16-minute short film is atmospherically shot, and the cast are very authentic mountain dwellers portraying this familiar characters. Like Joan Collins in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of this tale, the stepmother and the witch are played by the same woman and rub off with maximum results. The use of imaginative realism is consistent and quite evocative. Filled with the dreams and fears of children (and adults), this is a detailed and enjoyable short that is very good for learning filmmakers such as myself."
4,Not a slick fairy tale film,"This is the first fairy tale film adaptation from Davenport Films. The well-known tale of Hansel and Gretel is set in rural Appalachia during the Great Depression--a natural setting for this tale of hunger and abandonment. While the film can feel disjointed at points, it is a valiant effort from a filmmaker who has brought several fairy tales faithfully and creatively to film.Fairy tales aside, the video serves as a wonderful example of the changes in filmmaking and the evolution of Davenport Films, especially when compared with the much more polished, but never slick, recent films of ""Willa"" and ""Ashpet."" This film will be inspirational to budding film students on small budgets."
2,Not for me,This yoyo seemed like it would be a lot of fun but it broke within a couple of days of play and it has little parts and springs and its impossible to put back together. It's currently in the trash.
4,I Love yo-yos!,Yo-Yos are amazing... and i have always purchased Yomega's. I wont purchase any other brand of yo-yos. I just wish strings were more durable...
5,Classic Fun,"I bought this yo-yo out of idleness with no more intention but reconnecting with one of my childhood obsessions! And true to form, Yomega still makes awesome yo-yos! I've fallen in love with yo-yoing again and I'm glad I did! Great product and suitable for everyone!"
2,Not reliable.,"I used these on my guitar pedal board to try and save space, and in less than a couple moths one was completely unusable, and the other is on the way out. Over time the chord going into the adapter becomes loose, and eventually just falls out. Going to try and seek another brand."
2,Too loose,"A cable can fall right out of this adapter, it does not fit correctly. It's built solidly but designed poorly."
5,Truly pocketsize Italian dictionary,"This dictionary is great for travel. A bigger dictionary will have more words, but this is the dictionary that will fit in your pocket and will be going with you to class, the restaurant, the market, etc. If you need a larger dictionary to get you out of trouble, you never should have told that Italian joke. It wasn't your fault the pazzo had no sense of humor."
4,"worked well, not spectacular but well.","I expected effects that I remember after using similar products in Europe, but it did not happen. This one was ""lazy"" but it did the job after few iterations."
5,Take it to the kitchen!,"This is great stuff. I usually buy with a nod to the environment, but I bought this to fight soap scum. Does it ever. Today I took it to the kitchen where my refrigerator, white, inexpensive, was getting grimier and grimier no matter what I used. Seems cheap plastic handles are the norm now. Walla! So I did the stove, the microwave and the dishwasher. I can't say enough about this product. It smells clean when you leave, too. I'll still do my best for the environment, but for awhile I'm going to have clean."
4,Intimate Portrait - Witches,"A good basic overview of the history of Witches. It focuses mainly on the persecution of women through the ages, I would have liked to have seen a little more about the men in Witchcraft. The Interviews with modern Witches are interesting, but leave you asking for more. Worth watching."
4,"interesting, a good start","I enjoyed this video as a basis of witchcraft. It goes into some history behind the burning times and really gets you thinking about the reasons that women were (and still are) persecuted. Then it breifly goes into Wicca, or modern witchcraft. It has an iterview with Laurie Cabot as well as someother well known witches such as Z. Budapest."
2,Item seems to miss watering schedules,"I bought two of these at a local store to regulate my lawn watering. I liked the idea that the one unit could control two schedules independently, and that the unit also served as a Y-splitter so I didn't have to buy one of those. But it seemed to only hit one or two waterings before it would miss the next one. This happened more than once, and I was never really able to trust it to do the job."
2,Dies after a year,"Simple two zone timer that will work for one summer, after that it is dicey. Mine froze up and kept trying to close the valve. If you want to buy a new one all the time, I like how this one is easy to set."
4,Must have been a bad batch,"I purchased my second timer after the first one worked perfectly through it's second year. The new timer failed after a few weeks. Home Depot replaced it with another one that worked all summer. Hopefully, both will work when I hook them up in April. With gardens at our residence and vacation home, I have other brands of timers that have worked with no problems. This will be the fourth year for one, if it works when I install it."
2,Should be solar powered,"I recently bought one of these a one of the local hardware stores, not Amazon.What I absolutely don't like is it requires the use of alkaline batteries. I'm trying to get away from using those and have for the most part switched to rechargeable ones for near everything. Product should IMO be redesigned to either use those or even better have solar cells and be able to be run off of that with a litium battery being charged during daylight hours.What I do like is the ease of use of the user interface and the fact this has two outlet controls vs. just one. Using it for a drip irrigation system for two flower/plant beds and with two fifty foot hoses it does quite well.Seems I have run out to the store and buy some throw away alkalines, it totally killed two rechargeable ones in less than a day."
1,Too complicated,"The mysterious black button you're supposed to use to ""set the time"" makes no sense. Does the system have some kind of internal clock and you push the little black button to advance your start time in reference to that clock?? So the timer just somehow knows that the ""real"" time is when I put the batteries in, then I push this little black button (that's not even labeled) to advance my start time? Whatever. I thought I wanted a simple, reliable timer, but what I got was the infamous riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. Good luck using this product."
1,Unacceptable,"What the heck were they thinking when this was designed? I can't believe others haven't commented on this.This thing allows you to set intervals, right. 3hr, 12hr, 24hr... anyway, you get the point. SO, if you want this timer to go off at 6am, before the day heats up, every day, you have to wake up at 6am to set it. It doesn't have a clock! Only time intervals. What the heck! So you decide to turn it off for whatever reason. Guess what you have to do again to set it for 6am? Unacceptable."
1,Broke in less than one year,"A waste of time and money. Dead after less than a year. Replaced batteries, still dead. JONQUE! No compra!!"
4,Convenient,"I am on my second. People complained about the directions, but I found them to be basic and understandable. I like the timer. I was mad that it didn't last more than two years, but then I read the proper care instructions and realized it was my fault for not bringing it in over the winter (even if it was in a greenhouse - my bad) The timer works as promised and I LOVE that it does two zones."
1,Lasted Only One Season,"It worked as advertised for one season. At the beginning of the second, all the control knobs had seized up and wouldn't rotate. Would never buy another."
1,Two Zone Timer,I initially gave this product a great 5-star review. Now it's been 3 months since I started using it and it stopped working and the water didn't turn off like it should have. What a mess and what a piece of junk!
2,Good for one year,This worked flawlessly for one year and then gave up the ghost. It started running through fresh batteries at the rate of a set every 3-4 days and then it went into the garbage. In contrast I have a similar Orbit timer bought at the same time as this unit that is still running on the same set of batteries from last summer. I have to give it two stars for working for a year and being easy to set up and use.
3,Failed after two years,"I had a Lenmar battery for almost two years and it went dead one fine day without any provocation! I got the battery almost as soon as I had bought the FZ20 in 2006, and had used it interchangably with the Panasonic battery. They both lasted nearly same, maybe slightly longer than the Panasonic.Even though the Panasonic is still working, and I dont know why the Lenmar failed, I would still get another Lenmar as it is half the price of a Panasonic brand. Bottomline: Cheap, yes, maybe not as reliable as the Panasonic ones."
1,Inferior product,"Charge is not held as in the Panasonic product. Can be removed only with a sharp instrument, an action that can damage the camera housing."
1,Warning - This Lenmar battery can be HARD to remove!,Bought two of the Lenmar equivalents to Panasonics CGS-S002A. After a few charge/discharge cycles BOTH batteries would jam in the camera ... very difficult to remove. Both batteries developed a noticeable bulge in their case that made them dam* near impossible to get out of the camera. Lenmar did replace them with two new batteries ... which promptly developed the same problem. Will now try to get my money back from Lenmar ... tired of the hassle.
5,same as original,I see no difference at all between my original Panasonic battery and the one from Lenmar. Excellent price/value ratio!
5,Right size,Unlike another no name gereric batttery this one fit in my pansonic digital still camera perfectlly and works well. Can't comment on battery life compared to the pansonic brand yet.
3,Different dimensions than Panasonic battery,"This battery does exactly what I need it to (power my Panasonic DMC-FZ1 camera) with a modification. The Lenmar battery is slighter shorter than the Panasonic battery and therefore does not make a consistent connection to power the camera. I had to improvise by slipping a small piece of cardstock paper under the clip that holds the battery in to hold it tight to the connections. Otherwise the camera would not turn on or, worse, shut off in the middle of using it. The slip of paper does the job but then taking the battery out, charging it, and putting it back in isn't as quick or easy of a job as it was with the original battery, now that I have to keep track of the slip of paper and reseat the battery carefully with the slip of paper in place. If I knew what I know now, I think I would have bought another Panasonic battery to keep from dealing with this... it is too important to have a camera that works when you need it to when you have a 2-yr-old!"
3,Fascinating History,"This book is a welcome addition to learning more about the Bayeux Tapestry as it details life in 1066. So much is unknown about the making of the tapestry that this book fills in some of the gaps concerning life in those times. It doesn't answer questions about its construction but adds to the general knowledge of the era. While it is history, it is also very readable. Anyone interested in the tapestry will appreciate what this book adds."
5,book,a great book a good source of back history for some possible family place of origin or the start of family name
3,"very well written, not particularly convincing",This was a very enjoyable book. I found his summary of the history of the tapestry very interesting. His interpretation of the tapestry's meaning however is unconvincing. His main thesis relies on over-interpretation of features such such as whether a figure in the tapestry is squinting or scowling. Speculation such as the identity of the dwarf Turold hangs on the thinnest of threads. Nothing in this book was able to convince me that the standard argument that the tapestry was a Norman propaganda piece is incorrect.
3,Origination of the Bayeux Tapestry,"This is a very good book, but you really have to be interested in this to be able to follow it. Tons of names keep being mentioned as do locations in England & France) Would be nice to include a foldout with a map correlating the names and places to today; also ashort summary of all the names and who they are to have at your fingertips. Overall, I enjoyed the book though."
3,REMIXER NEEDS A SLAP INTHE HAND,"Timbixes 2000 gives us some serious high-energy and eurotrance beats that will get your feet moving, but, if you know the original songs and want to sing along.... You will be in for some sad moments. I can not belive that the voices on all of the tracks had to be pressed into some beatbox machine and the turn out is some irritating vocoder effect that killed the great lyrics that those songs had. Timbiriche, really never had a great singers, but, the lyrics and catchy hooks were the fun part and who ever the remixer was for this CD, should get a slap in the hand, for turning those voices into to some strange robotic sounds that is not near any Daft Punk, Eiffel 65 or not even Cher's famous sound. Those songs are classic of the mexican pop and they should had being left that way, if no one can be smart enough to turn them into a dance track."
2,Vocals too dated to be enjoyable.,"This CD contains 5 of the best country/western songs ever written: Take Me Back to Tulsa, Faded Love, Cherokee Maiden, Maiden's Prayer and San Antonio Rose. Unfortunately, they were recorded in 1946 and are somewhat lacking by today's standards.The instrumentation is fine but the singing will send cold chills down your spine if you are not familiar with Bob Wills' style. Just when you think to yourself that this doesn't sound so bad, a noise like a tomcat just got his genitalia caught in a bicycle sprocket wheel will emanate from the song you are listening to. This probably sounded pretty hot in 1946 but it just don't do it today (for me at least)I would stay away from these Tiffany Transcriptions and buy some newer versions of these songs by the Texas Playboys or some of the tribute CDs' by other artists."
3,weak plot but compelling characters,"not nearly as interesting and contained a plot as dexter's Brotherly Love, but the characters are just weird enough to inch their way into your consciousness. wasn't too wild about Train, the black golfer/caddy, but his side-kick Plural, an old fighter (do all dexter's novels reference fighting in some way?), who's gradually going blind and has an obsession with poultry, is cool. and the effed-up romance of norah and miller is as interesting -- and ultimately as damaging -- as a car crash."
3,Dexter is out of material; Very disappointing.,"I think Dexter is one of our best living writers and very much looked forward to reading this book. Sorry to say, but everything Dexter does in ""Train"" he has done before but to much better effect. Despite some brilliant scenes and fine funny moments, the overall story is hollow, emotionally and intellectually. It is grotesquely violent in a way that overwhelms everything else. I gave three stars because even a bad Dexter book is better than most of what passes for fiction these days. Perhaps, he needed the money."
2,Not real crazy about this one,"I picked this up in the library, just seeing the binding and thinking it was about trains. After reading the description and seeing the (misleading) ""National Book Award Winner"" caption on the cover, I decided to check it out.I haven't read any of the author's other books and I may check them out at some point, given the glowing reviews from others, but I did not find much enjoyment in this book. There were a few nuggets, but this book seemed a loose gathering of various substories, mixed with gratuitious sex and violence. The author does a great job of character development, though and that's what kept me reading to the end, which was a disappointment in itself, as well.My recommendation: Skip this one."
2,I hope Pete's not running out of gas..,"You can read the synopsis of this novel in any of the above reviews. The bottom line is, this book isn't up to Dexter's talent. I think the people who gave this book 4 and 5 stars are big Dexter fans (as am I), however, they're being way too generous on this bomb. Read The Paperboy, then read Paris Trout. After that, you'll know how great Dexter is when he's on his game."
1,needs more club,"train has a very interesting theme of a young black caddie who can really hit a golf ball, but just as the story is building up to a intricate level, it just drifts off to the end. very disappointing. i'd skip it. dgs"
2,Double Bogie,"Dexter has a style all his own, thus the 2 stars. Otherwise, I found the prose more dime story dramatics. Novels that get wrapped up in gutter talk belong in the trash.This book is trash."
5,Not Much Can Go Wrong,"This is as solid as it looks. This doesn't add any noise or loose the quality of the sound when used. I love the way it feels and the way it sounds when I plug my cables in because there is a definite (satisfying) click, so you know that it's secure."
4,cool,"item is as describe , a little bit heavy and once you insert the male tip its not that smooth but in general it sure does its job."
5,Got the job done,"Great, helped me out with my audio needsI am running my PS3 on a PC monitor with no sound, so i use the HDMI-to-DVI cable as video and i use the Composite cables as audio for my headphones, this connected my headphones to the red and white cable 3.5mm adapter.I am pleased"
4,works well,had to get this when my ipod headphones port failed and needed a female/female connector to attach a dock connector cable to my headphones. it works very well-- it's light and sturdy and doesn't get in the way.
2,Connection not stable,"The sound out of my right earphone does not always work when I use the coupler. Sometimes there is no sound and sometimes the sound is less than the left earphone. I have to rotate/turn/twist my earphones in the coupler until I find a connection that produces sound in my right earphone. I have tested the coupler with a few other things and the same thing happened. However, when I use my earphones and other cords without the coupler, they work fine. Given that it seems I can find a position that does work after some twisting, I’m going to continue using it."
2,No Adventure in george,"Well I found the quailty of this DVD poor. Nothing special, very short in length. My kids enjoyed it alot, but their 2 and 4 years-old. I personally don't think it was worth the money. Very short film and expensive. But hey if you love Curious George then it's worth it."
5,Adventure of Curious George,I like Curious George. He's a cute monkey. Sterling Home Entertainment & SVE made Adventures of Curious George.
1,Save your money,"...I was also very excited when I saw this 3 CD box set at [a local merchandise store]. 30 songs total, 10 per CD. What a deal! Advertised as the ""ORIGINAL ARTISTS."" Gerry & the Pacemakers, Freddie & the Dreamers, Chad & Jeremey, The Troggs, etc., etc. Problem is when these ""ORIGINAL ARTISTS"" originally made these hits , they were 23 year old, not 60. These are re-done, re-arranged, re-hashed, tired, lifeless re-makes, probably made 35 years after the originals. Lacking the vibrancy, vitality, freshness of the real originals. ... I bought it on Friday, listened to it on Sunday night, will attempt to return it .... By the way, beware of a slew of similarly packaged boxed set ""Hits of the: Fifties; Sixties; Seventies; Eighties; Blues; R&B; Doo-wop; etc., etc.,"" all featuring ""ORIGINAL ARTISTS."" Buyer beware."
4,Great and Well Priced,"Big, but that's what you get for 12x50s. They work well and are great for the price."
5,Improving your writing by using the correct word,"I was given this bookReader's Digest Use the Right Word: Modern Guide to Synonyms and Related Words, Lists of Antonyms, Copious Cross-References, a Complete and Legibleforty years ago and I still find it useful. So useful that I've purchased copies for each of my children and grandchildren when they started college.The book jacket describes, better than I can, what you'll find inside: ""Over 1,000 essays that define, compare, and contrast 6,000 synonyms and related words."" These essays do exactly that: they tell us the shades of meaning for related words so we may chose the appropriate one.While the number of words included is only about 6,000 this book is the best tool for helping you select the right word.Highly recommended."
2,Use the Right Word,This is mearly a thesaurus and not comprehensive at that. I was very disappointed. I expected a little more guidance and explanation as to using words appropriately.
2,Dog's Bollocks,"So, I bought this for my boyfriend, thinking that when we're apart he needs some loving too. Wow, it looks nice on here but the picture looks exactly like the actual item. 5 seconds after putting it on him his first words are, ""I'm sorry but, that looks like a pair of dog's bollocks."" And proceeded to giggle. So, I'm thinking this one is a no go, especially as he didn't take it home with him. You win some, you lose some."
2,What deflector shield?,"I used my Pampers points to order this Diego Soft Potty seat for my 17 month old son who is beginning potty training. He does well with the BabyBjorn chair we have, but I wanted another for our other bathroom and figured I'd go with this type of style. It slides around some on our elongated toilet seat, but it's ok. I don't think it will slide enough to ever fall in. My MAJOR problem is that the pee deflector sheild is not high enough. As soon as my son sat on it I realized I was in the shooting range! This makes a major mess. The good thing about it is that the cushion detaches from the plastic to make for easy cleaning."
2,"A fun seat, but not terribly comfortable","I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones! If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty ""unproductively"" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable. The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside. While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic. Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting. Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around. I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around. You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot."
1,Sucks,Does not fit on the toilet seat. It slides around. The pee guard is use less. My boy pees right over it. This is a waste of money.
3,"Simple, works","Not as pictured. The seat shown actually fits into a plastic frame (with low profile pee guard). Could possibly be used alone without plastic frame, but would wear out fairly soon as the inside rigid part of the seat is probably cardboard. Less bulky than others I've tried. Seat works - just know you're actually buying two pieces that snap together."
2,Fun design but not that practical,"My 2 year old son loves the Spiderman design but there are a few issues with the seat itself.1. A little small for my son who is tall for his age (40in) but might work fine for a regular size or smaller toddler.2. Slides around on the toilet seat as the description is wrong and there are no skids on the bottom to prevent this from happening. It does not slide enough that it or my son would fall off the toilet though.3. The splash guard is a joke as my son sits above it and must constantly be aware enough to point himself down as to not wet the entire bathroom. I would prefer the splash guard to be removable as it does not help.4. The description on Amazon is incorrect, this potty is just the seat as pictured. There is no Ziploc back for storage and the potty itself does not fold to take with you.All in all a slightly okay potty seat but requires some effort to make it work for my son."
3,"Really good, but not ideal on elongated toilets","My daughter loves this, and so do I (no more cleaning out little pottys.) The only thing I dont like is that it doesnt fit well on elongated toilets. It can slide around and probably could fall in. I have to sit her on it, and gently at that. If I had a non-elongated toilet seat, this would be perfect."
1,NOT stable on elongated toilets,"I chose this seat because the package states that it works for both standard and elongated toilets, but it definitely does not work for the elongated toilet seats. It slips around a lot and has dumped my child into the toilet on more than one occasion--and we've only had the seat for 1 day. We'll be a long time getting past those scares.It also seems generally flimsy and easily bent. The ring underneath is screwed on and there are lots of ridges and gaps, so I predict it will be hard to keep clean. Very disappointing. If I can return this thing, I will. Don't waste your money."
2,Doesn't work with elongated toilets,"We bought this because my son loves Elmo. Unfortunately, he now refuses to sit on it because it slips around on our elongated toilet seat. It is completely unstable. He won't admit it, but he's afraid of it. So, now he won't go on the big potty and is back to his Baby Bjorn potty chair. I'm going to buy something else."
3,Works as alternative to stand alone potties,"I bought this for my daughter to use at her Nana's house. Nana's bathroom is really tiny and this little insert fits nicely under the sink. My daughter ADORES Dora so this was the perfect thing to get her. Sometimes she gets distracted looking at the pictures though. Very cushy, and light. My not quite 2 year old can put it up on the big girl toilet all by herself. Good value for the money."
2,"""Pee Cup"" is a failure","I bought this seat so that my son would have an easier time aiming into the toilet. However, the pee cup only makes it more difficult. It does absolutely nothing to catch the stream, and instead provides even less room for him to aim down while sitting on the seat. The seats that have a tall, narrow cup are much better. I'm not sure who this seat is designed for.On the plus side, we've had no problems with this seat staying firmly on the toilet."
1,Cheap Junk,"This potty has a seat that fits (poorly) into a molded frame. The pee cup is part of that frame, so you cannot remove it. The soft seat is too small within its cheap hard frame. This product is useless for older tots still wanting the reassurance of a seat that fits them better (on the big toilet), but needing independence in the bathroom. It slips around within the molded frame and within the actual toilet seat. The handles do not help at all, and the pee cup is really in the way for little girls. It allows no stability and therefore no freedom! I am junking it!"
2,Just okay,"Purchased this for my son because he loves Dora but the seat does not fit over the oval bowls and unfortunately he fell in the toilet. Kind of defeating the purpose, so if you have oval bowls save your money."
3,it's ok,i bought the Dora potty ring at Target for my son. I don't like because it does slide around on the toliet--but so far it doesn't bother my son. The only thing I like about it it the ring seprates for the base so it's easy to clean. I won't buy another one.
3,Could use some handles,"We have a daughter who is 3 1/2 and a son who is 21 months. We bought this seat for our son because the one we already had didn't have a splash guard and we thought our son would need one as he first started using the potty. I miss the handles we had on the other potty ring. When you need to take this ring off (for big people to use the potty), you have to grab the ring instead of just grabbing the handles. It seems dirty. Also, so far, my son is having no parts of this splash guard. He never saw his sister use one and he doesn't want to use the splash guard either. I don't blame him. There doesn't seem to be enough room to sit behind the guard without bumping into it. He loves the Diego pictures and our other potty ring for upstairs is the Backyardigans, which he also loves. He just doesn't want to use the guards, and I'd prefer handles."
2,My son's pee leaks under the seat,Like other people have said this seat is very unstable and wobbley. I don't have an elongated toilet and it is still not a good fit. But my biggest problem is that my son's urine gets shot in between the two seats and I have to clean up the bottom of the potty training seat and the top of my toilet seat. Very gross. I have had other (flatter) seats that worked just fine with my other son but this one seems to hold him up too high with the cushioning so that he can't pee into the toilet.
2,Cute but my son won't use it,"My nearly 2 year old son wants to use the potty, but has trouble with the splash guard/cup on this model. He loves Elmo and wants to carry this seat around but will not use it. We also bought the Primo Ducka. He will sit on that seat all day if you let him. This might be a good choice for parents of girls."
3,Not for an elongated toilet but a great seat if it fits,"The details says that this potty seat will fit an elongated toilet seat. It will **not**. When my daughter tries to put it on the toilet it usually goes in the toilet. I help her and then she wants to sit on it by herself. As she sits it slides around (sometimes a side falls in). I help her but she wants to do it her self. its a huge mess and then of course its too late. Get a seat that was made for your toilet.**other than that, if the seat fits it is a GREAT seat. its nice and plush and has no sharp edges like others ive had, it has a small splash guard for a girl and handles. the seat itself removes so you can clean between the seat and the plastic which is nice"
5,sturdy & comfortable potty seat,"We bought this to take on vacation. It was lightweight and easy enough to pack in our luggage, yet sturdy enough to survive the abusive luggage handling. It fits perfectly on all the toilets we've tried, and is very soft and comfortable for our almost 3-year old son."
2,only for tiny toilet seats,"this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats. the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps. my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls. we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway. otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train."
2,My daughter wouldn't sit on it.,"She said that the little splash guard scratched her ""hoo-hoo"" when getting on and off the potty. We returned this item shortly thereafter. Design flaw if you ask me."
2,too small,This potty chair looks really cute and is cushy but the actual size is just too small for a potty training boy on the slightly above average size.
4,"Cute, but doesn't fit elongated toilet very well.","I really like this potty seat, but it doesn't quite fit well on our elongated toilet. It works well enough, and the colors aren't as bright as they appear in photo nor is the design exactly the same. It's o.k. for the price. My daughter really wanted a red potty seat, but if I could do it again I would buy her a different brand."
1,NOT DESIGNED FOR BOYS,This thing is useless for a boy starting out and not ready for standing and aiming! I am a Grandmother with 2 sons..cant beleive i didnt look at this closer..just wanted the Thomas since it is his favorite.Designer must not have children or at least BOYS.
4,"Better, but not trained yet.","My daughter did sit on dora seat longer and frequently then the other potty we had. But as of now, she still hasn't had a successful bathroom run. I would say that this product would be good for any child who loves dora shows. They have that new object curiousity combined with dora appeal. I think it was worth it."
2,Seat and shield too small for comfort,"At first glance, a five star Toy Story addition to bathroom, BUT.. seat barely fits on standard toilet seat and the urine shield is definitely too shallow to be comfortable or effective. The illustrations are nice and the padding is good but it does not fit the toilet properly. When my son used one of these 30 years ago, it fit much more snuggly and the shield was more appropriately sized for a two year old. My grandson feels safer on toilet without this seat. Definitely cannot recommend.The stars were for its illustrations not its usefulness."
1,my kid doesn't like it,"very hard seat, doesn't stay put inside toilet seat and isn't comfortable for the little ones. My child refuses to use it and reminds me often that she doesn't like it."
2,Too small,Although my son was excited about this seat it does not function well. My son is 2.5 and it's too small. When he pees it ends up shooting over the seat rather than into the toilet. If it were larger it would be much better.
3,"OK, but the spray guard is useless","My son is 28 months old and in full potty training mode. First we tried a dedicated chair, but since we have an older boy who uses the potty our little guy was not interested. I got this because he loves Elmo and it had a splash guard. The little one wants to point his own but has almost no ability to aim yet so the splash guard was a plus until we first used it. It does not come up high enough to do the job, it only crowds the space. All in all not bad the handles are good and he likes the Elmo on it but not the best."
1,Doesnt fit our toilet and not good for boys!,"I had bought this cause I thought its cute. well its cute but it doesn't function well. My 2 1/2 year old son slides all over the place, its not secure at all. When he pees he pees over and the pee goes even in between the seat so i have to flush everything and clean the toilet. the cup holder is a joke.. it really holds nothing, so i cannot recommend this for boys at all. I am about to get another potty seat, something that will hold his pee and will fit safely in my toilet."
2,Would not recommend for boys - get Disney Cars seat with bigger cover for penis,I have the Diego and the Disney cars seat for my twin boys and would not recommend the diego toilet seat for boys as the cover that makes sure the penis goes into the toilet is not big enough cover. I like the cushion and handles though. I would rather recommend the Disney car toilet seat with a larger potty cover for peepee.
3,Good potty.,"My son wanted a Thomas potty and this was a good choice for him. He loves the trains on the seat. However, the hole is not big enough. We have a difficult time getting my son positioned on the potty so that he can go without getting urine on the seat. And the cusion is not easy to keep clean because urine gets trapped underneath it and in the sides."
2,toddler liked the graphics but said seat pinched his skin,"The seat was very visually appealing and motivated him to potty, until he discovered that the vinyl seat stuck to his thighs and ripped skin off when he got up. The result was red sore thighs for a good 12 hours and his complete fear of pottys. If the big potty topic comes up, he wimpers and complains the big potty hurts and bit him. Back to the bjorn I guess."
2,it was just eh...,My son loves spongebob so naturally I had to get this for his potty seat. The pee shield isn't attached. Doesn't come with handles attached (which I noticed it said that later) and it wobbles on the toilet. Needless to say I went out and bought another seat and this one is in the closet
3,Slides on elongated toilets,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter who is a huge Elmo fan. She does quite well on it and I like it as opposed to a potty chair that I have to clean out. However, it does slide back and forth on elongated toilets and therefore we have to put her on the potty, she can't do it herself. I wish it came with some grippers or something on the bottom..."
2,DOES NOT STAY ON TOILET!!!,"I am so disappointed. I have a standard toilet seat and this potty seat does not sit snuggly on it, and does not even come close to fitting my elongated one upstairs. Plus it has no rubber grip material as many do on the bottom to keep it in place once my little one sits down. As a result he slips every time. I suggest bypassing this one and making sure you find one that is either adjustable or comes with some secure grips underneath. Many potty seats are non returnable -- unless you can test it on your toilet first, don't risk this one!"
4,A twisted tale,"My first thought was that these guys must be using better drugs than those availbale on the open market, or the not so open market, for that matter. Their imaginations are wilder than anything else I've encountered in my search for far-flung concepts. I found the book a little slow, to start, then it picked up with plenty of action and better than interesting character development. There's plenty of depth to the characters and the writers make sure the reader knows almost everything there is to know about the major players. Final analysis: this is a good old fashioned shoot 'em up...with serious twists on weapons, the bad guys and the good guys. I'd love to see somebody like Robert Rodriguez get a hold of this thing. His special effects would make this an outstanding film."
5,A Very Nice Collection of Timeless Rock and Roll,"I was born just a bit too late for the Classic Dop Wop of the 6o's.Just caught it at the end of its run in 1963..Now with the help of this great compilation, I am able to enjoy this great music.Very nicely put together with most tracts very high fidelity........The comprehensive booklet makes a nice guide to all the great groups with lots of photos.Too bad most of the greats have gone on to Rock and Roll heaven.....Really worth the price when you consider its the best vocal harmonies ever recorded."
2,Doo Wop,My co-worker got me into doo wop! I'm not a big fan but I have to admit that it takes me off to another world of pleasant romance!
5,Doo-Wop Heaven!,"This Rhino collection of Doo-Wop is a must-have for fans of the genre. With one exception, the recording quality is excellent and with one exception, the songs are first rate. Some might quibble with the inclusion of lesser known versions of ""Hearts Of Stone"" and ""Little Darlin'"" but that's just nit-picking."
4,"An incredible selection, sounding better than the originals","There are actually two box sets. The first one goes back to the precursors of doo wop in the 1940s, and goes chronologically. Most of the greats (and near-greats, and some not-so-greats) are included, from Earth Angel to Eddie My Love all the way up to the late '50s and a few in the 60's. The second box set has more misses, but still many that you'll remember and love. I wish they weren't so expensive -- about $16 per CD even though it's a set -- but the enclosed lengthy booklets (all in English so they reall are long) are fascinating, delving into various aspects of the history of individual songs and artists in particular, and the genre in general. The re-mastering is brilliant -- eerie at first because they sound clearer and better than the originals. Purists might find that a drawback, but the rest of us will love it: clear as a (whispering) bell."
2,Only for the hard core collector....,".... I am not. Sound quality is very poor - not the mastering but much of the original recording is horrible. Probably didn't have Bruce Swedien yet. For me, a lot of the songs are sort of dopey. Oh well. I took a chance - glad I bought it used."
5,A Loud & Enthusiastic Thumbs Up!,Painting The Walls Red has a real depth that only those of us over 40 can really appreciate. Aging well means laughter and hope and Judy gives us both in this truly touching and often times spiritual approach to really living this particular phase of life. I give it a loud and enthusiastic thumbs up!!!
2,If it's a gift....,"You may not want to purchase this if it's for a gift. There was a really large tag that was all beat up, which made the product seem like it had been on someone's shelf for a while.....Half of the reason I love Amazon is for the prices...but I don't need to advertise for them when giving a gift. The sticker would not pull of easily and when I tried, it just made a bigger mess.Lose the big stickers on the back of your books!"
3,Take Two,"My partner and I were touring Hawaii by cruise ship and used this book in conjunction with the Trailblazer series. Instead of using the workout room aboard ship, we worked out hiking the beautiful trails on Maui and Kaui. Since the Fodor's didn't provide detailed maps we relied on the full pagers in the Trailblazer. It was a good system for combining loafing with seeing the place on foot and also a nice way to work off the enormous amount of food availalbe almost 24 hours a day. Fodor's provided a good cultural overview."
2,Sour Fruit,"I'm all for Seth Rogen taking his comedy ball and running with it, but I'm just not smellin' what he's cookin' with this one. Stoned or not, it's just not funny enough for me.When I wanted it to be funny, it wasn't. Even the seemingly lighthearted moments were punctuated with a gunshot to the face! Don't get me wrong,I have no problem with violence as entertainment, but I was close to shocked at how many folks were shot and killed in this flick. Did I need to see the brain splatter and Rosie Perez empty her gun to get the premise?Granted, for the story to ""turn out"" given the lightweight script, a LOT of folks had to be eliminated to sew things up, but egads! If you can remain sharp during this flick, you'll also notice a couple continuity gaffs. I'm afraid - just like I did with No Country for Old Men - I'm gonna have to go against the overwhelming wave of support for Pineapple Express and go with a 2-fer in the star category."
5,Classic stoner movie,"This is the kind of movie that you really want to see in a theater full of people, where everyone laughs at the same time. It's no mystery that this movie is about weed and smoking vast quantities of it, so seeing this movie in a theater with a bunch of high people makes it even more enjoyable. That said, I cannot wait for this DVD to be released so I can watch it at home with my friends.I won't review the movie here, but if you see this movie under the influence (of weed), that you will have a great time. There were so many moments in the movie where it seemed as though my friends and I were the only people who understood the joke. This should mean that we can watch at home happily and discuss those moments that others didn't understand.It is a funny movie and if you like Seth Rogan and/or weed, then you should get this."
1,"Bad review for DVD, not movie","If I were reviewing the movie, I'd give it four stars. Very funny!However, on the unrated version of this movie, the dubbing is frequently off. The spoken lines don't match up with the actors' mouths. Very annoying. I haven't watched the theatrical cut yet, so I don't know if it's a problem on that version."
1,Don't waste ur time!!,don't even bother to watch this film even if you are stoned!! This is the most annoying and stupid movie that i had seen for the last 3 years!!!
2,Big Let Down,Had high hopes.. walked out half-way through.. Big Let Down! A comedy is to be funny.. this wasn't.. How many pot scenes do we need??
1,toke up and it might reach 2 stars,"A whole new sensation ! Boring stoner flicks. I have seen, and laughed at, Cheech and Chong without the aid of drugs. Pineapple Express is like House music, you'd have to have drugs to make it work.It's beyond me how much critical acclaim this movie received, perhaps they filled the theater with pineapple smoke during the critics screening ??Had it erred on the side of slap stick it may have worked better, but I was left with that ""why did I waste an evening on this ?"" feeling.Uno Star"
1,Digital Copy EXPIRED A YEAR AGO.,"My Pineapple Express Blu-Ray/Digital copy arrived in February 2011, but the digital copy expired in January of 2010! Over a YEAR ago. Now the digital copy disk is completely useless, and I've overpaid for a product that I cannot fully use. Very, very disappointed."
1,Will not play on my two blu-ray players,"I managed to play the digital copy of this movie and it was funny. However, I paid for a blu-ray HD movie and the blu-ray disk would not play in both of my blu-ray players. My PS3 has the 3.15 firmware which is current as of 2010, and all is does is show four puffs of smoke on the screen, and nothing else. Same thing on my Toshiba, current firmware and no movie.Do NOT waste your money."
2,slackers rejoice,A moment or two comedy that raises it above a 'hated it' rating but a general waste of effort. I'm not a prude but 25% of the dialogue revolves around F**K. A movie of little substance except for the slackers of the world living off their parents or the government.
2,Pineapple what?,"I had heard good things about this movie when it came out a few months ago. I thought it would be smart and funny. I'm disappointed - it's neither. Stoner classic? No way. Watch 'Harold and Kumar' if you want to watch a better stoner movie. This movie never really got to the point where I really found it funny and interesting, although there are a few midly funny moments here and there. It got so boring towards the end that I was even thinking about stopping it. Very predictable. And it's annoying to see this guy Seth Rogen play an awkward late-twenties or early-thirties loser in every movie. He's just not that funny.. give us a break.Bottomline: Not the movie I should have rented on a Friday to chill after a long hard week of work."
3,breavis and buthole in the flesh,"this movie is ok, but really lame. I would not buy it for over 10 dollars and your better off renting this film. Franck claim he did not wish to do crap and he goes and make this movie. Save your money folks and buy it used or rent it."
1,A 1-chuckle movie,"I wish that people who have written that this is the funniest movie ever would explain it to me. My wife and I sat through it without so much as one real laugh. Certainly, the dialogue was not funny. (If you disagree, give me an example of a funny line from the movie.) The only thing that made me even have a mild chuckle was when one guy tried to stick the other guy's piece of ear back on. If there was supposed to be more such physical humor, it must have not have been original enough to make us laugh.Funny is ""Two And A Half Men"" and ""Big Bang Theory"" and some parts of ""Letterman"". This movie was like the other parts of ""Letterman""."
1,Seth Rogan is not funny,"Bad acting and luckiest man alive Seth Rogan should never be a front man. He can deliver on small parts, more then 3 min in a row and he falls apart."
1,Cheech and Chong for the new generation,"I think you will need to be stoned to laugh at this movie. This reminded me of Cheech and Chong movies (with a different plot, if you can call it a plot). The preview of the movie is the only part worth watching. I am sure if I was drunk or stoned I would give it 4 stars."
1,Pineapple Express was a complete dud compared to...,"I really liked 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and SuperBad, but I was very disappointed with Pineapple Express. The movie had little to no direction, and I simply found it boring. I just finished watching it on Blu-ray, and to be honest, the out-take real was 50X funnier than the movie itself.I had high hopes for this movie, but all I can say is that is was a total dud."
2,Let down.,This movie only goes to show that you can't combine comedy with action. Especially when the two main characters are stoned most of the time. It just wasn't funny enough to justify the ticket price. I don't think it's even worth the DVD rental price.
1,Not even funny when your bored and no other movie left to watch!,I wouldnt even give it a star at all. This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.
5,one of the funniest movies I've seen,"This rates 5 stars based on fun. I was talked into seeing this movie last year while vacationing in Orlando and thought I would hate it. I ended up laughing more than I have in a long time. There's nothing highbrow or the least bit intelligent about it, but that's one of the things I liked. Pineapple Express doesn't try to be something it's not. The movie is dumb, makes absolutely no sense, but was so funny. The violence was so cartoonish, it was like watching an old road-runner cartoon where Wile E Coyote gets blown up over and over again. And you can see that no one involved with the movie was taking it seriously. Regarding the marijuana use, speaking from the perspective of someone who is not a user, I don't think it was glorified at all, I mean look at what happened to them as a result of it!! But it's still funny."
4,"Check it out, at least once.","It is rare that I will say a bad thing about a movie, and this is no exception. I have a fairly large collection of movies, and I added this one a few months back. If you are looking for a little stoner fun, this is your movie. Some have said it compares with Cheech and Chong, they would be wrong. Nothing wrong however with adding it to the collection, and if you watch it once a year you won't be disappointed with the investment."
5,A must see especially if you are feeling depressed,"As someone earlier commented, this is not the normal pot movie. so, even if you are against marijuana, you will find this movie addictive. The opening 2-3 minute track just gives you a hint of what a superior movie this is. i have highly recommended it to my friends. and i come back here on occasion just to watch the short trailer."
4,Instant Classic!,"I'm not very detailed with reviews so I'll get to the point...If you are looking for a funny, interesting, action-style stoner flick...you've arrived at the Pineapple Express.The acting wasn't the greatest, at times I felt like the dialogue lacked originality, but the movie covered a lot of ground...friendship, betrayal, murder, love and forgiveness, sarcasm etc etc...(quite a punch for a stoner-flick).Pineapple Express is probably one of the most ""goriest"" stoner-flicks I've ever seen, aside from ""Idle Hands"", due to the action towards the end, other than that the movie plays out pretty well, the story line is solid and the cast is hilarious.Overall...all I have to say is...if you like skeezy-stoner-flicks BUY IT! the price is totally worth it."
3,Pineapples are great !,So if you don't know Pineapple Express is a stoner movie and its named after the movies very rare strain of high grade weed. Watch it the way it was meant to be watched... with Pineapples.
2,I guess I just don't get it.,"Maybe I am not the target demographic here, but this just wasn't that funny. My wife and I are huge fans of everything Apatow has been involved with. We own Forgetting Sarah Marshall, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad on Blu-Ray and watch them regularly. Those movies have heart and a pretty interesting set of characters thet we cared about. A couple of idiots getting wasted, one of whom may (legally) be considered a pedophile, and then going on the run from gangsters? Not all that interesting.I've never used drugs. Maybe if I had then this would have been funnier."
2,Ugh,"At least Cheech and Chong movies were funny...Judd Apatow has got to ditch Seth Rogan for leading man roles. He can't carry a movie and his acting is as blunt, funny-for-one-or-two-jokes and knuckle dragging as his personality. To be positive however, he makes a great side man. What was James Franco thinking , doing this disaster of a movie? I will say, if Apatow was targeting the under 21 crowd, which is possible, then I retract everything I said, and the movie is brilliant. :) ..it's too bad too, because like other Apatow movies, Superbad, he does have a talent for comedic movies targeted at the kid who never quite grew up, but he needs to find a way to make them without having the whole thing degenerate into uninteresting silliness (unless as I said, he's targeting juveniles). Good luck Judd!"
1,"Puff, Puff Your Blues Away!","Maybe I've entered the dinosaur stage of my life but this ghastly entertainment, actually screened in movie theaters, was such a boring, messed-up job of people smoking weed nonstop that I thirty minutes was enough for me.Seth Rogan is now our Slacker Jerry Lewis of the 21st Century. Once was enough when he emerged with this sloppy guy who lives in greasy jeans, flannel shirts and flip-flops in ""Knocked Up."" He was somebody fresh and different. He was even lovable. Since then, it's been the same sloppy, unwashed slacker guy and in this incredibly boring epic, he does nothing but smoke, smoke, smoke that strange cigarette. If you're really into weed, then you might get a couple of yuks out of this. To those of us who aren't into weed or drugs (okay, I'll confess, I'm clean) you might show this at a party for your buddies to see how stupid movies can be. i really think that everyone involved in this movie were weed lovers."
2,Moronic Pot Head Get Kicked in the Testicles,If you like watching potheads acting like the morons that they are this is the movie for you. It is pretty funny and I always love seeing a burned out idiot getting kicked in the testicles.Not exactly Shakespeare but it has it niche.
3,You ain't got no style,"What's not to love about stoners on the run? Both Rogen and Franco made a great duo in danger, though ultimately it was Franco who stole the limelight. The honest humor of his Saul outshone Rogen's straight man style by far. Rogen is the same in every film he does, so expect no great acting from him. The cast around him more than makes up."
3,Ride the Express,"Pineapple Express is not quite as good as I expected; one could say I compared it a tad unfairly to Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Knocked Up, my 2 favorite Apatow movies. But this was advertised in comparison with those movies, so I don't think my comparison was that unfair.This doesn't have much of the brains, importance, or *dare I say it*charm*nevermind* of the previous two, but it most likely wasn't meant to. I didn't care that much about the characters (they were getting shot left and right and doing pretty bad things, i.e. selling weed to kids), so there leaves that. The anti-pot moments(yes, Seth Rogen makes an anti-pot speech, I was surprised too) of the film don't really follow to the end. But at the same time, thecertain parts of this movie were just too damn funny for me to not recommend this movie in some way. Though, the last half hour or so truly goes overboard with Tarantino-level expliotative violence. All in all, it was fun I guess, but nothing really special."
4,Pineapple Express,"Dale Denton (Rogan) is a process server and a stoner. He has a girlfriend in high school (Heard), and likes to hang out with his dealer, Saul (Franco). One evening, Dale witnesses a murder. The murderers, a drug lord (Cole) and a crooked cop (Perez) are soon on his tail. They trace a joint left behind at the scene, a variety called ""Pineapple Express"" back to Saul, and soon Dale and Saul are running for their lives.""Pineapple Express"" is yet another film from the Judd Apatow machine, and on par with ""Superbad."" Rogen and Franco have good chemistry and comic timing. Franco is more at home in dramas, but is genuinely funny here. Despite being a ""stoner movie"", it is a buddy movie at heart. Action is not what you would expect from Rogen, and although he handles it well, especially in the last 30 minutes, the action packed ending does run a bit long. Overall, ""Pineapple Express"" delivers what it promises: a funny stoner comedy."
3,3 Stars,"After witnessing a murder involving a corrupt cop (Rosie Perez) and a drug kingpin (Gary Cole), straitlaced pothead Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) must go on the run with his dealer (James Franco) to escape the wrath of vengeance-minded criminals.check out my full review [...]"
1,Painful,"There isn't much to say here. Pineapple Express is more of the kind of witless ""comedies"" being spawned for the lowest common denominator. There is no sense of timing, no jokes, no charismatic preformers, nothing. I hated everyone in this film; Seth Rogan is a terrible actor with a voice adkin to Alex Jones with a sore throat. What seems to be ""witty"" dialogue is just yelling your lungs out. The physical comedy has no panache. People are just beaten. How is this possibly funny ? I have enjoyed ""stoner"" comedy in the form of Cheech and Chong; My favorite film of theirs being Nice Dreams. Pineapple Express is just ugly. Ugly people who smash and blow each other to bits. I don't mind dark comedy either. I loved Hot Fuzz which would probably be considered alot more macabre than this film but the people behind that film were infinetly smarter."
3,I'm gonna design septic tanks for playgrounds,"Rogen's improvisational comedies usually work out really well -- I loved Superbad, for instance -- but at two hours in length, this one is definitely flabby and should have been trimmed back by about a quarter. Cute, but slight and stretched out a bit too long.Franco does a great job here, though, in a role originally inspired by Brad Pitt's character in True Romance.A rental at most."
3,Disappointed,"I had high expectations (pun not intended) going into the movie, and I had heard mostly positive comments from friends. The movie had some funny parts, but most of it was stupid drug humor. While I was entertained, I walked away a little let down. I like Seth Rogen and crew, but did not like the movie."
3,"""We should hide in this dumpster!...Why? Because I'm already in here!""","I saw Pineapple Express with my boyfriend at the movie theaters. At first I really didn't want to see a movie all about drugs. I felt I wouldn't understand and wouldn't enjoy it for that reason. In the end I liked the movie and wasn't too confused. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and wanted to see it again. My favorite scenes were with the Chinese, they seemed like ninjas and I thought they were hilarious. His favorite character was the cat loving drug dealer who just wouldn't die, the guy who looked like the best friend in Shaun of the Dead. I liked him too, but he kind of grossed me out. Dale Denton and Saul have a dynamic friendship which I think the movie was supposed to be about. Yes the film is extremely casual about the usage of drugs but I do not think they are condoning it. There are a ton of laughs and memorable characters , which makes the movie worthwhile to me."
4,Funniest Movie of 2008,"I saw this in the theatre and I wasn't high, but I did laugh all the way through, along with the rest of the audience. Probably most hilarious movie I've seen since ""The 40-Year Old Virgin."" I don't understand why this got shafted by critics' end of the year Top Ten Lists. I saw Tropic Thunder on several of those lists, and in my opinion ""Pineapple"" was way funnier than Ben Stiller's film. A good time will be had even if you don't smoke weed."
4,Blu-Ray Issues?,"Just got this for Blu-Ray. Wouldn't start on my PS3 at all. It would get to the puffs of smoke and then reset, infinitely.The fix for me was pretty easy. I just turned off Blu-Ray internet connection. Once I did that, it started up with no problem.As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, it's a basic comedy movie. There's really no reason to pick this up on Blu-Ray if you already have it in DVD. It's nice to have it look crisp and clear, but there's no need to double-dip.As far as the content goes, I really enjoyed this movie. It's better the first time around. I've found that with each viewing some scenes lose their humor, but all-in-all, it's still a very hilarious movie. Keep in mind that this is a stoner comedy. You may not be into this if you're not into goofy, stoner humor. You've been warned."
5,i love this movie!!!,this is my favorite movie. i love every one it n every line they say. i have watched it soooo many times n i still laugh! :D
4,Pretty much everything i expected,"All the contents were there. It's a great movie if you understand and can relate, not saying that I did. Gave it a 4 because the corners were a little messed up, probably should blame the shipping company more but perhaps it should have been wrapped in a manner that this wouldn't have been able to happen"
3,Item 9,"The first 5 minutes or so had me on the floor and until a bad thing happened in the flick, about 20 or so minutes into it, it was also pretty damn funny-but then...never did finish it, nothing like....this bad thing, in a stoner movie to harsh your mellow-but seriously, if you get a chance, catch at least the beginning."
4,I laughed so hard!!,I love Seth Rogen! It was funny as f@%#!!! I laughed so hard I peed alittle!! Glad I bought it!
3,Funny the first couple of times you watch -,"Bought this on an impulse buy, was funny the first 2x after seeing it on TV but now it just sits and collects dust, one of those movies you just have to be in the mood for the stupidity ..good for the humor collection I suppose -"
5,Best New Team Since Cheech and Chong,I'm a fan of Cheech and Chong. There has been no competition since. Not until Pineapple Express came along. These two guys are great together. I laughed out loud throughout the movie. It was funny and silly in a stoney kind of way. I can see these two doing future movies of the same genre together. They should really consider it.Pineapple Express (Single-Disc Unrated Edition)
2,Review of Blu Ray/Digital Copy,"The two stars is not indicative of the film but rather the Blu-Ray/Digital Copy. Bought this item hoping to be able to download the digital copy shown in customers photos. Unfortunately, iTunes gave an error message stating that this was an incorrect redemption code. I contacted Sony customer service only to find out the Digital Copy had expired. I love the film and already had it on DVD but bought this combo specifically for the Digital Copy. Still not a bad price for the Blu-Ray. Just be warned and don't expect both."
2,not a very good movie,"I was very disappointed, stupid me for buying the movie before watching it. I was so convinced it would be some type of funny yet action filled movie, instead it was completely stupid...and not even stupid funny...just stupid, and now I have learned my lesson, just because it has a few decent actors in it and because it got a few decent reviews, review it yourself before buying."
1,badly scratched ......,"We just received the CD, and it is completely scratched up, we cleaned it with CD cleaner but it is skipping all over the place. I know I paid just a little over 4 bucks for it, and maybe should not complain, but what I have now is a worthless CD. It is not worth returning it because it costs me about 3 Dollars to return it. Maybe someone has mercy on me and send me another copy, that would make my son happy."
1,Not 4 Stoners,This movie is a complete wreck. Its supposed to be for stoners with short attention span and cannot be more long and boring. The humor is very subpar and dry. Looks like they didnt know where to go with this one and wanted to cash in on the Seth Rogen moneytrain. I kept smoking thinking it was going to get good...3 bags of chips and 40 blunts later nothing but comatoast wondering why people actually like this movie. Stay away
1,What a waste of an hour!,"My wife & I tried to watch this movie & I really wanted to like it, but try as I did we turned it off to stop the pain. It was slow and pointless and even my daughters that are in high school turned it off. I thought that was saying a lot as many of their friends thought it was funny. I guess it shows that most people have very little taste in movies. I'm glad I rented it first before adding to my 350+ Blu-ray collection."
1,Excessively Violent,"My friends all either love or like this movie but I can't stand it. We saw it in the theater and then rented it and both times I have came to the same conclusion: that it is excessively violent, and not very funny.There are a tremendous amount of scenes with violence: someone's ear being shot off, someone's head going through a sink, and countless gunshots. I get that some of the scenes call for violence but when every other scene is someone getting shot I get the sense that the long fighting sequences were used as a filler for the lack of comedy in the movie.In addition, Seth Rogen seems to be reading his lines word for word from his script with no energy or enthusiasm whatsoever.If you want to see a good stoner comedy, see either Harold and Kumar or Up In Smoke. Those are classics; this movie is a complete waste of time."
2,Kiss your Treo Bye-Bye,"Stay away from this product!!! The holster does not clip securely to the top of the treo, so anytime anything even as much as bumps into you, your treo falls off. I had never dropped my treo in the 3 months I had owned it, and within the first 15 minutes of having this holster, it dropped twice. I had a nextel phone with a similar type of clip and when it would lock in place, it would not fall off, ever. Look for other holsters out there, or just go with a swivel, but this is basically a useless piece of plastic."
4,POINT BLANK,"SOME HONEST HARD HITTING ACTION FROM ROURKE ,IF NOT THE BEST SHOW OF HIS CHARACTER ACTING.LOOKING FOR AN OSCAR,DONT BOTHER.LOOKING FOR FOR REAL GRIT,DONT WAIT!GET THIS TITLE TODAY.IN MY OPINION I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BAD ROURKE FILM,HE'S A REAL MAN, ONE THE LIKES WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE ""THE DUKE""(IF I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHO ""THE DUKE"" IS THEN YOUR'E REALLY IN THE WRONG PLACE."
2,"Okay, Not Great","Dolph is the leader of a group of survivors living on an army base after an earthquake isolates California from the rest of the US.I love Dolph in just about everything, but this movie really suffered from the lack of a decent script.The writer, just couldn't seem to decide whether to do a 'survival' film, mad max, or some something like the ""Stand."" What we get is a hodge podge of several decent ideas, with none of them actually going anywhere. Dolph limps valiantly through the storyline, trying to hold it together, with dialog revolving around eating cans of alpo and finding water. Plot threads are left hanging like tinsel.This movie would've been much better, if they had made it a straight action flick, and left out the hordes of urine drinking, heroin-shooting inmates.I give this movie 2 stars, for what it could've been."
4,Should have been a series pilot.,"I'm watching this and enjoying it and then I think, ""This would have made an awesome series"". To me it seems like a series pitch that didn't get picked up so they released it as a DVD movie. It's a little hokey and that made me think of a Sci-Fi channel show but I would have watched it anyway because I like the concept and Dolph is in it."
4,"Fun, but doesn't fit 49mm lenses","It's not going to replace a real macro lens, but it's fun to use. However, I was disappointed that the fit is not really that universal. It'll not clip onto my 49mm lenses because it's 49mm as well...I was hoping to use it with my Pentax f2.8 40mm pancake and f2.4 35mm, but it just won't fit. Thus, I can only use it on my kit and zoom lenses which require good lighting condition to produce decent results."
4,good macro lens,"I use this macro lens mounted in my camera, for sure it depend on the camera it self to give proper macro photo but it is ok and for sure the best for the price"
3,Gets the job done... mostly,"For the price, you can't really complain too much. However, the vignette that results around the image is rather annoying."
5,Raynox DCR250,"Neat and simple ... works great, light and easy to clip on to your exixting lens for those macro shots."
5,3SIS with DCR-250,The optical quality of the DCR-250 rivals some much more expensive macro lenses for DSLRs. The shallow depth of field is a problem with all macro lenses and not just the DCR-250. Macro photography takes some practice and than the DCR-250 produces very sharp crisp images.
4,The Wild Bronco of Macro Converters...,"Ignore the bonehead who blew a gasket (below) over a customer service issue, and childishly decided to flame the manufacturer on all of their listings here. Raynox products are well-made, have good optics, and are a good value.This particular macro lens is ->extrememly<- powerful! Because of this it has a ->very<- low depth of field. If you're new to macro photography I might recommend the Nikon 6t, but if you want the most powerful macro lens in its class, go with this one. It uses a spring clip to attach to the lens, which means you don't need to buy step-up/down rings."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT UNIVERSAL!,I ordered this product due to online reviews. It might be a good product and it might actually work BUT IT WON'T FIT/WORK ON MY 70MM CANON LENS! VERY DISAPPOINTED! THE PROCESS FOR RETURNING WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT I EVER HAD. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT UNTIL YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHICH CAMERAS IT FITS AND WHICH IT DOESN'T! MANUFACTURER DOESN'T TELL YOU ON AMAZON EITHER AND I COULDN'T FIND IT ON THEIR WEBSITE. BEWARE!
3,Old fair SCi-Fi /Midge in Scotland,Future Europe has fallen after atomic warfare and is now ruled over by the Chinese. Angus is one of a group of hunters who shoot deer in exchange for supplies and to avoid the labor camps. The radioactivity has created swarms of burning killer Midges/ insects . Angus rescues Liu a Chinese woman officer after she is taken prisoner following a helicopter crash . After discovering that they can communicate with the Midges they have to flee the Chinese and English who want to know their secret of not being burned in the ever growing swarms of insects.Its fair but not something you will miss out on by not having on your shelf .
2,Good narration ...,Not a bad documentary. Much like what you would see on TV for older events with no film. First time I ever recall hearing Richard Dreyfuss do a documentary. He sounds like a natural and should do more narrating. I give it 2.5 stars.
5,Loved it!,Johnstown Flood is one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. I learned a lot about an event that I really never learned about in school. And Richard Dreyfuss did an excellent job narrating. I highly recommend this informative and emotional DVD.
1,Sad Attempt,What a sad pathetic attempt of a documentary! Do not wast any of your time and money on this. Such an interesting tragic story in our history deserves more respect than this wannabe horror movie delivers! Richard Dreyfuss is a great narrator but seems lost and almost silly in this.
2,No new footage from the Real World Shows,"I bought this video thinking we would see more of what actually happened on the Real World Vacations but it was disappointing. While the three hosts did offer some insight to some of the scenes it was all replay. Note to those hoping to see nude footage of the Real World cast members, don't bother. You see nothing here you didn't see on the TV show."
1,Lotsa Nekkid Peeps...,NOT...This video did not add anything new to what I hadn't already seen...The shameless plugs for Heather B's beauty spot (dont think I didnt notice the jersey) was terrible...and John quit begging for a record contract...Rachel we all know you love Puck...Thanks
2,ok....,ok this video was different. It was poorly hosted though and they acted as if they didnt know what to talk about. The only really good part in the movie is when they showed when they got in a fight. Dont waste your money buy a good video!
2,Not what I expected..not worth the money,I bought this video thinking I was going to see some behind the scenes footage of what happend on the Vacations. All I got was Heather B poorly narriating the entire video! There was more gum flapping than actual vacation video. Don't waste your money.
2,disappointed,"When I bought this, I didn't realize that it wasn't a regular book. It comes with a cartridge for the ""Power Touch""Book. I never heard of this type of book, and didn't understand. As a result, we just have the plastic pages to look at, and when I ask ""do you want mommy to read you this?"" My daughter says no."
1,These all broke.,"I had 30 of these in a computer lab, and they all broke within a year. The sound would start to drop out, kids would twist on them to try to ""fix"" them, and then something inside would snap. A total waste of money."
1,horrible,"As a profession, I use my laptop. The mini mouse is excellent in looks and that's as far as it goes. The software is terrible and the bluetooth connection is continually lost. Working for aprox. 3 hours I would loose the connection about 5 times. Sometimes the software won't even pickup a reconnect and a computer restart is necessary. Not worth the price or the frustration."
2,"Worked Fine, than Stop Working",This dongle and mouse works pretty for a month. It did find my bluetooth cell phone and connect to it. But the mouse stopped working after 1 month. Maybe a low quality rechargeable battery. It's too bad.
4,great for the value,i own the spin and save containers and hated them. The lids did not fit and my husband took the containers to work for lunch and because they were tall they were hard to reheat and eat out of. I love this the storage is great. I am always having to fish around for the lids of containers and this system not only has a great price and a well known name it had the container sizes that i needed low and round. The storage unit is great and the 2 larger cups use the same lid so there are only two diffrent size lids. For those of you who have the spin and save and have the same problem i did with a little push the ziplock containers with the screw on lid fit in the spinny thing but they are tall as well.
2,Official Warped Kickball,"I bought mine two weeks ago, and have used it for two kickball team practices and it's already warped. I want to know if I can exchange it.UPDATE: I was sent a 12.5"" kickball, not a 10"" kickball."
4,Appears to be decent quality (like dodge balls from gym class!),"I wanted a playground ball (a la grade school gym class and foursquare). This is the real deal...right size, feel, action. Some reviews mention needing to fill it on arrival. Mine arrived filled--ready to bounce and kick. Playground/kickballs are not meant to be overfilled or they don't have the right action. I don't know how it will hold up longterm, which is why I gave four stars and not five, but it appears to be high quality."
4,Mikasa kickball vs. Tachikara kickball,"I bought both this ball and the more durable Tachikara kickball. After using the Tachikara for a couple of minutes, I chose this one for our game. With college-age guys kicking it with all their might, it retained its shape for a few hours of play.While it's not the most durable ball, it is the best for a laid back game of kickball. It's the perfect size -- 10"" as opposed to the 8.5"" Tachikara.In addition, even though I have bought virtually everything I own on Amazon, I found this ball for much cheaper at a local sporting goods store. So I plan on buying a new one of these for each kickball game. It's well worth it for a few hours of fun with a couple dozen friends."
1,Try something else!,"I'm a youth pastor, and we play lots of sports type games. I thought, hey - an ""official"" kickball, should last me a while, right? Nope. Not only did it fail to hold air after about a month, but it became misshapen rather quickly. We didn't abuse it or over inflate it. I was unimpressed - I'm now going to try the Voit ball."
3,"The classic kickball, but practically disposable","This is pretty much the classic red rubber playground kickball you remember from when you were a kid. Here's the trouble: you're not a kid anymore. When full sized adults kick this thing hard, it gradually gets lumpy and ours tore in the fourth inning. We switched to an 8 1/2"" playground ball to finish out the game. I liked the ball while it was in use, but just make sure you have a backup."
5,kickball,quality of product was very good. Grandsons play kickball all the time and this ball has held up very well.
2,It has no bounce.,The ball arrived kind of soft. It has no bounce. My son was so excited to get it but then doesn't ever play with it because it's not bouncy. I'm sorry I picked this one. Also it's very big. I didn't realize how large this would be. I should have gone with something a little smaller and a lot bouncier.
2,Fun While It Lasted,"The official ""WAKA""-approved kickball leaves a lot to be desired in the realm of durability. Right after I bought it, I rushed back to my university and started up a kickball game. Little did I know it was going to pop three innings in. A friend of mine kicked it and as it flew over my head, I could hear it hissing the whole time. Just as he was about to touch base, someone else pegged him with it only to find that it was flat. Everyone had to go back to their dorms and study, so maybe a little good came from this ruddy kickball.On a side note, it worked pretty well until it popped. I'm not sure if it was a bad ball or we were too rough on it. Judging by the reviews, it's not built to last."
4,A Timeless Rarity!,"Under The Western Sky is one of the most treasured, family-friendly folk albums in the market.Jim Hendricks is a very talented musician and he re-created the Old West like it is, even though this album is recorded in Nashville.I worked at a Six Flags park as a services host and one of the sections had 9 of the 12 masterpieces on this album in the background (with more rarities, I have yet to find them). I just recently came back there as a foods host.It's a shame none of this stuff is receiving airplay, and some of his albums are considered out of print.I gave this 4 out of 5 because I can do without the stupid sound effects."
3,1/2 of Donny and Marie is still better then most other Christmas DVD's.,"This DVD was ok, not as good as the Donny and Marie Christmas which featured the whole family. This only has Marie's son and her nephews. But still worth the low price and is better to some of the junk that comes out now a days."
5,Magical Marie,"I really enjoyed this show, the scenery was beautiful, Marie looked great and it was great family entertainment. It was nice to see marie's parents and her so happy."
3,Good Purchase,"This was a very inexpensive DVD to add to my collection. It was funny ""admiring"" the ""big"" clothes and ""big"" hair of that time! Just to think...man, we had nerve to believe we looked great! haha! Kirk and Candice Cameron were silly too - ok; that moonwalk leaves nothing to be desired! haha But they were two very popular actors during that time. And I never did see this when it hit the airwaves back then. I gave it 3 stars because it didn't hold my attention in one sitting. But it is a good holiday video to have if you're a Marie fan or Cameron fan. Though the Cameron's aren't on very long."
5,Rainey Days,"This is the 1st title won by Wayne Rainey.One of three in a row.The legendary champion wins with a couple races left.You get to see the battle between Rainey,Schwantz,Lawson,Doohan and Gardner.This season was a breakout year for Doohan who finished third.Lawson and Gardner have accidents which take them out of the title early in the season.Be sure to buy it off Amazon instead of from Duke.Duke has a terrible customer service which doesn't answer your e-mails or phone calls.This DVD is well worth the watch.It has 4 time champ Lawson.One time champs Gardner and Schwantz and 5 time to be champ Mick Doohan.There is a great biography of Wayne Rainey available on Amazon."
2,An author in love with his own voice,"I received this book as a gift, and I will say it was no gift to read. The author is so much in love with his own words, it gets in the way of the storytelling. Nice plot ideas, but the book plods on and I ended up putting it down early. This is the first time in many years of reading that I felt I could not go on with the story. It's interesting that it's only one of his family members that raves about the book here. And please don't make a movie about this book. There are many other stories better left to the big screen."
1,I am confused,I am really confused. Looking at the playlist for Tiffany Transcriptions Vol. 10 and then reading the reviews has me wondering what is going on. The music mentioned in the reviews has nothing in common with the titles on the playlist. What happened?
1,Rip Off,I ordered this for my father for Christmas. He tried it two weeks later when he was about to go skiing. It did not work at all. He called the manufacturer's tech support. They told him they knew it was a defective product and that it was supposed to have been pulled off the market. Yet Waste King still sells it. They refused to refund my money because I didn't discover that it didn't work until after the 15 days they allow for the customer to realize it doesn't work.
4,Hilarious,"It's not War and Peace; but it's a heck of a lot of fun.If you're needing a good laugh, pick it up and open any page. Better yet, read a few entries to a friend who's down. You'll both be howling."
2,Reprint of old Harper's Commentary,"This condensed commentary can serve its purpose for casual reference. However, this is a reprint of the 1961 Harper's Bible Commentary which we have in our church library. The current Harper's Bible Commentary (see the text ""this review refers to the hardcover edition"") is a much expanded version.There is a need for a commentary that condenses or summarizes whole chapters or sections instead of verse-by-verse commentary, but don't assume, as I did, that this book is a condensation of the current Harper's Bible Commentary as the information on this page would lead you to believe.For an orientation to the books of the Bible and their themes, the Pocket Bible Commentary can be useful. However, I would recommend ""Halley's Bible Handbook,"" 25th edition. Its summaries of the books are about as long and it has a lot of other useful information."
4,"A few issues, but in generl, this is fantastic","I also had a similar problem with the DVD being glued into the book. I was able to remove it with a tiny amount of damage - the DVD image got a little scratched. No big deal, and the DVD works fine, but it *is* disappointing. My flip book came out of the package without any issues though.This really *is* an incredible experience, though, and I highly recommend it. If you love experimetnal format books, this is especially for you.The biggest issue I have with this is the navigation of the DVD; it is broken into foru sections: commercials, Idents, Music Videos and Animation. Navigation between individual pieces within each category doesnt seem to be possible, which is puzzling."
3,Hmmm.....O.K.,"Well, I stay in INDIA and i bought this book through a book dealer who charged me 10$ extra than the price @ AMAZON. The book is GOOD nothing more nothing less. But is amazingly attractive. Flipbook is USELESS. packaging is simply AMAZING but THE DVD BEING STUCK IS *BAD* u can get it out albeit a few scratches. OVERALL JUST ABOUT OK."
4,Great Introduction to Barenaked Ladies for newcomers,"If you do not own a Barenaked Ladies CD this is a good selection for you. I suspect those new to the Ladies will find tracks on thsi CD they are familiar with but did not know the artist.My favorites on this disc include, ""Jane"", ""Lovers in a dangerous Time"", and a very nice live recording of ""What a good boy""."
5,"Great Collection, but...","This is a fabulous album, but I'd much rather have all of BNL albums on my ipod and create my own 'greatest hits' playlist. I really feel the lack of 'straw hat and old dirty hank' on this collection, but their is a fair representation of their early work. Just buy all the CDs and have done with it."
5,How can you go wrong?,"OK, so I already own everything by BNL. I bought this too. I guess I'm a completist.I'll keep it in the car....I'll be the one singing, loudly, next to you at the stoplight."
5,definitely all their greatest hits,"Barenaked Ladies have a great place in music. They release songs that are funny, catchy, and thought-provoking. This collection captures the ones that made it to the radio. Sometimes, that's not what you want as an introduction to a band, but occasionally it works. This compilation definitely works.I put this album into my CD player (well, usually my iPod) when I want to be in a good mood. There is simply no resisting the toe-tapping goodness of 'Alternative Girlfriend' and their early hit 'If I had $1,000,000'. 'Jane' and the cover of 'Lovers in a Dangerous Time' prove that the Barenaked Ladies aren't just funny, but can weave a tight song comprised of excellent vocals and a strong band.Even if this is the only Barenaked Ladies album that you'll ever own, go see their live concerts. A concert with them is not to be missed. They add hilarious improvs, do impromptu covers of any artist under the sun, and comfortably chat with the audience."
4,A great compilation from a great band,"The Barenaked Ladies have always been one of my favorite bands, so I had to have this CD. The new songs are decent at best, and I had all the other CDs, but the liner notes are soooo great. Steven Page, the band's front man, goes through each song and what he was thinking. It's great to read the band's view of all their best songs. Also, the live version of Brian Wilson is really cool, I hadn't heard it live before, and I love it. This is an essential CD for BNL fans, even if you have all the other CDs."
5,Exellent Disk for BNL Newbies,"Great disk! I am a 'radio listener' of BNL, and really was surprised that a number of songs that I really liked were done by them! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the songs heard on the radio. This is not one of those disks that the only song you like is the one you bought it for. Definite enhancement to any collection."
3,Nothing Special Here,"I can just see the hardcore BNL fans grinding their teeth right now, but this CD just didn't do anything for me. Sure you get there hits, all 3 of them, but the rest of the album just didn't catch my interest. Like so many other performers out there in today's music scene, these guys just don't add anything new to the genre, sure they had a couple of catchy hits that people liked, including me, but as far as this being a must have CD? I don't think so"
2,bare naked ladies,"The seller stated in his ad that this item was in very good condition. This seller ""Cannot Be TRUSTED"" this CD was scratched and only plays part of the songs."
2,For Hardcore Fans Only,"If you are a fan and own all of their music, this might be a nice compilation to add to your collection...but then again, if you own all their music, why bother? If you're not a fan, this will do little to make you one...so, why bother? Nice, but uninspirational."
2,Don't do it.,"As someone who's seen BNL 9 times starting in 1992, and followed them from obscurity to mainstream, I recommend that you skip this album and just buy all 6 of their previous albums. Gordon, Maybe You Should Drive, and Born on a Pirate Ship are far superior albums to their more recent forays into mainstream pop."
5,A great compilation!,"This is the perfect CD for anyone who wants to get into the music but doesn't know where to start, or for those of you who only want the hits you are familiar with. Well, this disc has those hits and then some. Even if you have all their previous albums, which I do recommend, this has 2 new tracks PLUS the hard to find ""Lovers in a Dangerous Time"" and ""Get in Line"" which was on the King of the Hill soundtrack. Now you don't have to buy that to get all their songs. This disc is a can't miss buy."
