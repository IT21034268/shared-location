5,Nice set,Great cookware. Only wish that was a larger set available with more pieces. All in all very happy with this set!
5,Couldn't be better!,"After having ordered a single item in the Rachael Ray collection, I decided to order the complete 10-piece hard-anodized cookware set. Solid gold in every way. So appreciate having beautiful cookware that really does the job! Sincere thanks."
4,"Rachael Ray 10-Piece Hard-Anodized Cookware Set, Orange","Recently purchased the Rachael Ray 10 Piece Hard-Anodized Cookware Set, Orange and I LOVE IT! Sorry, I waited so long to invest in a bettercookware set. It not only looks great, but cooks and cleans with ease.You can actually take a paper towel and clean it, food and residue comeout easily. I would recommend, and have, this to anyone who likes tocook and not spend an hour cleaning the cookware afterward."
2,rachael ray 10 pc cookware,"We bought the 10-pc Rachael Ray cookware set as a gift for my son so these are his thoughts on the item and the reason I'm returning them.Once we started using the cookware we handwashed them after use and after the first week we noticed on some of the pans the non-stick was starting to peel back on the edges,so before it got worse or to late we decided to return the items. The other issues I discovered that were particular to me, the handles get very slippery when washing, you can't ""kant"" the lid on the pan for slow boiling it's either on of off because the lid slids down the handle. We wanted to keep from using the dishwasher so we handwashed from the beginning and we noticed that the lid has a small space between the glass and food would accumulate in the small space during cooking. Even after letting the lid soak the food was hard to wash out.Rachael Ray Hard Anodized Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set, Orange"
2,I urge you not to buy the set,I am appalled at the quality of this cookwear. I bought these for my wife this past Christmas and I am incredibly angry at the poor quality after just a short time using them. First they started to peel (that teflon peel)when making pasta. Then one of the pots warped rendering the lip useless. Then a lid broke. The only good thing about this set are the skillets. Don't buy the rest. I need to write Ms. Ray and tell her she should be embarrassed to put her name on this crap.
1,Don't buy!!,Don't buy unless you want pans that last less than a year. I've had to stop using mine because the insides are washing out. I would not buy pans like this again. I thought they would be better because of the name behind them...
2,Great at first,"I purchased this set in jan of 2009. It is now about 8 months old. I loved it for the first six months. After that, the metal on the lids began to rust and the top edges of the non-stick material began to peel. The set was never put in the dishwasher, scrubbed with abrassive materials or had metal utensils used in it. I will replace this item with a higher end product next time. Great set if you only plan on using it for a year or so. You get what you pay for!"
2,leaves grey residue on food; safe?,"We were trilled for several days. Then we started to notice grey residue/spots on eggs, rice ... and we started to wonder how safe is it, particularly for pregnant women and children?"
2,"Fooled by ""See Thru Lids""","I was attracted to the sale price, the cushion handles, and the see-thru lids that are advertised ""monitor foods without removing lid"". However, once the food heats up and steam is produced, you can't see a thing and have to remove the lid anyway. So, the drawbacks are: can't put the set in the dishwasher, have to take the lids off anyway plus you have to be careful not to bang them around or they'll break, plus if you have a ceramic stovetop like I do, then you cannot place a hot pot on a cool part of the stovetop or it may adhere to it, ruining your cooktop. I sent my set back to the manufacturer- not as advertised, and too many other drawbacks."
5,Rachel Ray Cookware review,"EVERYTHING WAS RECEIVED ON TIME, WELL PACKED AND IN GOOD SHAPE. WE HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WHATSOEVER. THANK YOU.JOE & LINDA DONOHO"
1,I HATE this set!,I purchased this set at Sams club for 145.00.I was frying something in the skillet and when I was done I turned the stove off and went to get the skillet off of my stove (smooth top stove) and it was stuck like super glue! It took me 10 minutes to get it unstuck.There was nothing on the stove top so it had to be the skillet. Needless to say...they will be going back to the store!
1,Lining peeled after one cycle in dishwasher on top rack,"I am so upset. I just unloaded my dishwasher, and after one washing on the top rack, one of the sauce pans came out with the lining peeling away. It is advertised to be dishwasher safe and now this! I will never buy Rachel Ray products again."
4,Go Rachel!,"I ordered this set back in January after cooking with cheap cookware for several years. I LOVE to cook now! Food cooks evenly and quickly. Yes, the lids steam up, but really, I wasn't using lids to cook with before because my pans were all bent and they didn't fit. So they still hold the heat in more than what I had before. :) I do wish they were dishwasher safe. Having 4 kids, I hate having to wash dishes, but really the clean up on these is every easy. It takes probably less time than putting in the dishwasher, but I like knowing my dishes are ""clean"". I've had this product for over 6 months now, and it still looks brand new! A+++ Here!"
4,Very good pans for the money.,These are very good pots and pans. The only reason I didn't give these a five star is because you can't put them in a dish washer or it will void the warranty. So if your looking for pans that can go in a dish washer these are not the ones to buy.
4,Momma Was Right,"My mom got these a few months ago, and kept nagging me to buy them because they were ""that great"". I read alot of reviews before I decided to go with this set. I received them about a week ago. I got a great deal (free shipping, [...]$ rebate, free knife set). This cookware is very nice. It's heavy enough, but not too heavy. The orange handles are comfy. I suggest you read the care instructions if you buy them (hand-wash only, and if too much oil residue gets in them the non-stick wont work). This makes me nervous; I dont' want to mess us my new set. The food tastes great, cleanup is very easy. Good set for a great price! Thanks Momma!"
2,A REVIEW AFTER 18 MONTHS,"Most people will use these pots and pans for a week then write a stellar review. In fact for the first year, I raved about them. They were the best set I have ever owned. Unfortunately, if you take time to peruse reviews, you'll see that every ten to fifteen reviews echo the same complaints. Warping of the pan itself and peeling of the non-stick surface. These only last a year if you use them a few times a week."
3,Rachel Ray Cookware,"Rachael Ray 10-Piece Hard-Anodized Cookware Set, OrangeThe skillets are very hard to clean on inside around the screw sets that hold the handles onto the base. This is especially true if you cook something like a scrambled egg. There is food material that wraps in and around these metal attachments. Cleaning by hand is a chore."
4,Time will tell...,"Love the easy cleanup! Not yet sure about the proportions of the pots--taller and narrower than my old set, takes some getting used to. And the large pot shows some minor scartches on the inside bottom even though I used non-stick-safe utensils. Overall, I would buy it again, just waiting to see how durable this set is over time(have only had the set for about 2 months.)"
5,Best Cookware Ever,"I love everything about it, from the hot orange handles that stay cool to the never stick surface. Pot lids are clear so you can watch the progress of your meal. The smallest pot is the very best pot I've ever had. It's diameter is small, but the pot is tall, so it works for almost everything I cook. I love my purchase."
3,size matters,surprised how small most of the pots and pans were. Kept looking for the full size frying pan and stock pot. I guess this will help my diet. A strip of bacon has to be folded in te frying pan and nothing covers the outer heat ring on our glass stove top.. Seems solid and well built. Rivots holding handles are big-thats good but they are not flush with the side wall and its difficult to clean around them .
2,Doesn't Heat,We got these for christmas last year. I was sooo excited we got rid of just about every other pan we owned. Big mistake. These pots are lovely!! But they do not heat. It seriously takes twice as long to do anything. Please save your money!! I know lot's of people love this product. But purchase only 1 pan and see if you love the pot.
3,Loved at first...now concerned!,"Well, I was in love with my RR cooking set until recently (it has been about 3 years). My 3qt pot has warped so badly that the lid does not fit. I have never put them in the dishwasher so I am not sure what has happened. I am just waiting for the rest to go.When I first got them they were so fantastic that I bought the oval pasta pot, oval saute pan, cookie sheets, muffin tins and more. My only complaint is with the crisper sheets and this pan. No pot should warp so badly that the lid does not fit- Especially with RR's name on it. This wasn't a cheap drug store set. I cannot even find a warranty place to go through to have this taken care of. So disappointed!"
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this cookware! It is the perfect weight, and I love the orange, grippy handles. The nonstick is fantastic - food slides right out of the pans! I am very pleased with this purchase, and would recommend this set not only for its quality, but for the price value!"
5,Purchased for myself and as gifts.,"After purchasing this set for my own personal use, I was so pleased that I purchased another set for our R.V. and an additional set for a gift. I would recommend this cookwear to anyone!"
5,"Love, Love, Love","These are the nicest set of cookwear I've ever owned. They are not to heavy to handle for an old lady. I love the grips don't need pot holders. I recomend this set of Rachel Ray's cookwear to young and old cooks around the world. Thank you Rachel!Rachael Ray 10-Piece Hard-Anodized Cookware Set, Orange"
4,Great taste,This is our favorite jerk sauce and it was sent correctly and speedily by the merchyant so all is well.
5,Walkerswood Jamaican Jerk Seasoning,"Ran into this stuff first at a Hops Grill and Bar, grilled salmon. Liked it so much I bought a little tub of it from the place. I've moved, and Hops is not around here. No worries. I can do my own thing with a jar of this, some clarified butter, sour cream and yoghurt.A little goes a long ways. But I don't know of anything that compares, let alone beats the taste."
2,Good if you love VERY Salty Vinegary food,"I saw all the great reviews on this item and decided to try it out myself. I couldn't wait to cook up some jerk chicken for my friends.However, I was very disappointed when with the final product. The paste itself was very salty and VERY VERY vinegary. I thought cooking will mellow it out. It didn't. I will not buy or even use this again. The taste and the sharp scent of vinegar overpowers the other spices and the flavor of the meat."
3,Hot and Spicy!,"This seasoning is too hot for us. Tried to use it couple times, gave up and gave it to our friends who like hot spices."
5,The only jerk seasoning to buy,"In my opinion this is the best and only seasoning to buy for jerking your meats, it is spicy, easy to use and the absolute authentic jerk seasoning I will swear by. I have used this on all types of chicken and some other meats, I would not reccomend this for fish,unless you are going to pan sear the fish, fish is too delicate for this, try their marinade instead. This seasonig is not for the faint of heart, it is very hot and spicy just the way i like it. Try this only if you like your food hot and spicy, the seasoning works very well on the grill."
4,CHUNG TA NOI,"I have been learning Vietnamese for over five years have not followed any structured course or school, and this is the discipline approach I need. I have only been through Chapter 1, and it has a lot of new vocabulary with an emphasis on verbs. The vocabulary used is from North Vietnam and the Southern equivelents are not given. I like the info on Vietnamese culture in the exercises, and each chapter has some ca dao (Vietnamese proverbs) to learn. The CDs sound like a few college students gathered around a tape recorder, and the sound quality could be better. The listening exercises are challenging, with both North and South speakers represented. The CD does not give the English eqivalents to the dialog or vocabulary. Pure and fast Vietnamese only. Amazon says the book is only 19 pages but it is actually 400. Very comprehensive. I look forward to improving my Vietnamese with this book. Another good book at this level is Intermediate Spoken Vietnamese."
3,Road Show,"Was really looking forward to this one, but was sorely disappointed. I have always been a fan of Stan Kenton and I prefer the Kenton of old; the arrangements on this recording were extremely brassy and loud. June Christy suffered from a mild case of laryngitis, still acceptable. The Freshmen were top drawer as always. To some listeners this would rank as a classic, however, I'm planning to resell the CD at a loss."
5,ROAD sHOW - Stan Kenton - CD,"There is a small group of people born at just the right time to mature with the music of Stan Kenton during the mid 50s to late 60s when he was at his prime in innovation. He invented a new musical instrument! Think about that for a minute.The rest is musical history. Although this is the best live recording of him and a sterling technical achievement by Capitol Records one other recording is unique and sometimes overlooked. ""Cuban Fire""! Johnny Richards did some really ground breaking arrangements of the Cuban influence on Stan.Actually, those of us Kenton fans had a hard time or nonexistent time ever getting the R&R; thing. We just were too far ahead of them to go back to guitars and more guitars jacked up with electronics. Stan knew what dissonance was and how to use it, they did not."
5,Pleasant; and directive.,"With the intake of this prose on the morning of each day, I was led to a Spiritual Growth of indeterminable proportions."
5,A Theoretical Study,"This is an intellectual pursuit of the Holy One. It is not limited to, but rather, written expressly for, the intellectual pursuit of the Almighty. Once one realizes this possibility, it is scientifically and physiologically developed through the reading of this book."
4,Intellectual; Real,"This book made sense, intellectually. Yet, it is based upon a definite faith. It's hard to explain, and hard to fathom, but is very enriching. You feel much better after you've read it, than before. It changes your life."
4,gret movie...put it on DVD!!,wish it was on dvd. I saw this in the theater when it came out...the cinematography was very nice. a good green mt tale.
3,"Good, but not great.","I worked on this film in my early days in the film industry, and it took me nine years to get a copy. The story is touching, but the direction feels a little stilted, and the movie could have used with 25 minutes shaved off the running time. Overall, it's a decent small budget indie film set in glorious Vermont."
3,Mixipick's Pick #1,"The listing gave no film titles.Here they are:Vol. 1THE STAR CHAMBERROMANCING THE STONEA CHORUS LINETHE JEWEL OF THE NILEVol. 2WALL STREETTHE WAR OF THE ROSESSHINING THROUGHDON'T SAY A WORDIT RUNS IN THE FAMILYTHE SENTINELThe DVDs come in two tri-fold packets that slide into a paper slip case. 4 DVDs in one and 6 DVDs in the other for a total of 10 DVDs. There are slip-in slots into which the DVDs are entered. No plastic anywhere in this set,...it's all paper. Not much protection here and I would think too easy to scratch the DVDs. Containers are flimsy but functional.The film selection is OK. I don't care much for The Star Chamber but I like the films where Mr. Douglas is paired up with Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito. AND there are actually two films here I haven't seen so, that's a bonus.Mr. Douglas has had a terrific career and I am sure we will soon see a box set that includes some of his greatest films.That's it. I'm done."
2,Terrible Packaging,"I received this Michael Douglas Collection, as a present, and so far, have found two of the DVDs are completely defective, (meaning I have been unable to play them, even after, cleaning them). The films, themselves, are enjoyable and Douglas is excellent in the ""Sentinel"" and ""Shining Through"", and great fun in ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"". In general, all the collection are good choices, but you take your chances with the terrible packaging in cardboard slots that scratch the DVDs, easily."
5,The best soundtrack out of all 3!!!,The first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie was the best one out of all three. But the second film has the best soundtrack out of all 3. This is one of those albums I can listen to all the waay through and not have to hit the skip button once.
2,Techno album,"Not to bad to be that old , the Best song Ya Kid K and Vanilla Ice everything else it's ok"
1,boring!!!,"This is the most boring excersice video I ever owned! I bought it about a year ago, tried it maybe three times and never once did I finish either of their routine. Yes, watching the twins dancing by themselves (at begining and end of the routine) was nice but the part for me [was bad]. The worst part I can remember is that you hop back and forth for maybe 5 minutues, feels like 25, both arms up for half of the time and the other half having a finger touching your forehead. I felt like a complete idiot."
3,Fitness? Yes. Bellydancing? Sorta.,"When I first bought this DVD I was very happy with what it offered me. It helped me learn some of the basic moves that I would need when I later started taking a class. However, this DVD does not teach you how to *dance*--it will teach you a few selective steps/moves used in dance. The focus here is the fitness, not the dance.I do not recommend this to someone wanting to learn to dance, or looking to get into Mideastern Dance as a pro. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to supplement their classwork, or anyone who is looking for an alternative to aerobics type exercise."
4,Great if you use it,"Like any workout video, this is great if you are disciplined enough to use it. Just a touch more interesting and exotic than something like Jane Fonda Aerobics."
3,No happy medium for intermediates.,"Fat Burning (25 mins) is almost straight hopping. You can make the workout easier by stepping through the moves instead. It will definitely get your heart rate up, and zaps the calves like nothing else. Mine actually ache for several days after doing the routine. The warmup and cooldown are enjoyable. This is a brief but CHALLENGING workout.The other segment, Basic Moves (30 minutes) is low impact and low-effort. It's more like a ""day-off"" workout--less strenuous than most yoga and pilates DVDs. You will experience some upper-body toning as you do make ""snake arms,"" shimmy, and do other dancelike, sinuous moves. But unless you're a real fitness beginner, it won't work you out."
4,Nice workout,"I think these are great for anyone wanting something a little different. I really liked basic moves, but didn't really care for fat-burning. The basic moves is really fun. But the fat burning workout feels like more jumping around than bellydancing."
1,slow,This DVD is so slow. It has a lot of warm up. I tried to keep watching it but was so bored with the looong warm up I couldn't take it anymore.
1,Didn't live up to expectations,"I was very dissapointed with this video. I read the other reviews and was very excited to learn to bellydance and get a workout at the same time. I found the video extremely boring and the reason I wanted to try bellydancing was to do something fun, new and exotic. Veena and Neena seemed very impersonal with using a voice over, instead of talking to the camera like other workout videos, like Kathy Smith. They also did not seem to have the something special like when you think of bellydance:mysterious and sexy. They seemed cut off from their body. If you think you are getting a deal because this video is less expensive, remember you get what you pay for. After being dissapointed, I tried Dolphina's and Shamira's videos, which are much better. Both have that special bellydance something that makes you want to be like them."
3,Very entertaining but not exercise!,"The basic moves portion of the dvd was great in order to learn the movements in bellydance, but I would not consider it real exercise. The moves are definately sexy and I think the video is an excellent introduction. The cardio portion was not as much fun and consists of a lot of jumping back and forth on your toes and putting your finger to your forehead. It felt pretty silly and not sexy at all! The extra footage of the sister's dances were really motivating and beautiful. The dvd is worth the purchase, only if you are not expecting to work out!"
5,Very fun and high Energy!,"The basic moves and fat burning DVD is so much fun and exhilirating! You really work up a sweat performing these sensual moves and you can really feel it all over. Veena and Neena are so much fun to watch and listen to. They make it look so easy and you can tell bellydance is a great workout. The music is fun and easy to follow. This is a great buy, you won't get bored with this one!Thanks"
4,Good intro to bellydance...but not for me,"I enjoy dancing, but I had never tried bellydancing. I tried this workout to get an intro to bellydance and exercise all in one.There are many things that I like about this video: There are a lot of good isolations that will help tone certain parts of your body (I especially felt it in my arms). There are also a lot of good hip isolations, which seems to be the heart of bellydancing.But, I did not find myself enjoying the dancing/workout, and I think it comes down to the fact that bellydancing may not be for me. I found it to be a little too slow and it didn't get my heart-rate up very much.While this was not really my 'thing' it seems like this workout does provide a good introduction to basic bellydance moves and good isolations that will work on toning some of your muscles.Also, the dancers (Neena and Veena?) perform the moves beautifully. So, I do not think that my opinion of the dancing is a reflection of the dancing, in general, or the instructors."
4,Great Video,"I am just starting a fitness plan and thought this would be a good addition to vary my routine. I just got it today and did the Basic Moves and it was a great workout. If you are already extemely fit, this would be too easy for you...as the name implies this is for beginners. It was just right for me."
4,Bellydance Fitness for Beginners - Basic Moves & Fat Burning,"This combination certainly runs the gambit of easy and not so easy.The beginner moves are too easy for anyone with dance experience,and you won't really learn anything ot get much of a workout.The fat burning portion burns fat, that's for sure. It's a bit repetative, but then again aren't most aerobic workouts? At least this is a little more fun.I would add that if you're looking at this series to learn how to bellydance, then you have the wrong series. This DVD is a workout, and not much else.Also, in defense of the N&V; videos I would like to say to anyone who gave this, or any of thier videos marks for being ""dangerous"" because the twins are barefoot: *Oh my God! It's not like your feet are for walking on or anything like that.* If you need shoes, then wear them. But instead of complaining about the video recognize that some people don't and move on."
5,lolol ! This is fun.,"I'm moving body parts that I couldn't move before.I went dancing and there is certain music that youbelly dance to and I was doing it.My girl friend asked me, where did you learn to do that?"
5,Bellydance = Sensual and Fit Woman,"Seeing the advertisements for the Bellydance videos featuring Veena and Neena on TV, I was skeptical. I thought to myself, ""This is just another 'miracle workout' that won't work.""Later, as I went to the Nature Company, one of my favorite stores, I saw the video sets, and decided to buy this beginner's tape to try it out. I went home, popped it in the VCR, and was amazed by how easy and fun bellydancing could be! I've never been one to enjoy exercise, because I found it boring and repetitious. However, this Bellydance Beginner tape is fun, and you won't believe how quickly the workout goes by. Just when you are having maximum fun, it's time to cool-down and end.Now, I feel healthier, have noticed a dramatic loss in my waist-area, and feel sensual and sexy. One great thing about the tape is that not only is it a fun way to stay fit, but it is also a way to feel sexy-after all, who says you can't show your partner your new moves? =)"
3,half good half bad,"The twins are very good instructors, the first section Basic Moves is intersting and fun, fine for beginners and for the people who wants to do some workout,but the second section Fat Burning is very very very bored,tedius and you can hurt your knees because always is jump and jump. If you want to learn bellydance you can have The Sensual Art of Bellydance series, they are very nice,sensual, fun and they teach you very good."
2,Boring!,"I understand that the fitness dvd was for beginners but it was so boring. I did not keep it on for too long. Except for the beginning where they did their bellydancing, the whole workout dvd was mostly warm-ups. Very boring! I wanted the exciting stuff they did at the beginning."
4,My opinion on belly dance for fitness,"I took out of the library the video ""Belly Dance forFitness"" and after one week of having it home with me I decided to buy it, so I went to amazon books and found it right away and at a very accessible price. I am really glad about my buy. I am usually lazy for work outs, but this one is enjoyable, inspiring and fun, and I am doing it three tines a week. I thnk it also has an effect in the way I feel free to move and express my sex-appeal all along the day. I am in my fifties and used to feel ""plump"", now I see myself like ""a real woman with curves""...It feels great!"
5,Just starting out,"I've just started out learning to dance (after a year of pondering the idea). This was the first thing I found in VHS form, and after going through it I had to convert it to DVD. The first one is awsome for people who never quite learned how to move their bodies beyond walking and running (me!). It teaches the basic movements that will be incorporated into dance at a more advanced stage, as well as focuses on the exercise aspect of it. Plus, it takes the time to let you see how different things are done, rather than rushing ahead just to show off the expertise of the dancers on the video. The same thing goes for the second work out on this dvd. I was very happy with this and am looking forward to getting a hold of anything else by these sisters."
2,DO YOU LIKE TOUCHING YOUR FOREHEAD???,"Not very many ""belly"" moves. alot of low hoping and forehead touching. Yes its a good workout, yes the music is nice, yes I got bored really fast. used it twice!"
1,Full of Entertaining Fluff but no Education,"Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this. They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content. ""I love birthday parties, yeah"" - ""They're here, let the party begin"" - ""oink oink"". This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often. Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it. There is little actual phonics training. The phonics ""games"" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff. These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good. The Leappads are worthless."
1,Unsatisfactory:Return to Futuro for refund,"First, no supplier receipt was included in shipment;receipt required by Futuro for refund.Heavy sewn welt around heel opening caused blister on one heel, open sore on side of other foot. Unfortunate, since compression feature would have earned top rating."
1,not what i expected,the was only one sock i expected two. even though it was rated 20 to 30 mg it was much thicker and ugly that any other compression stocking i have ever bought.
3,Sizing of product was off.,"While the product was very promptly delivered, I was disappointed in the sizing. Although I measured right in the middle of the extra-large size, I found the hose to be somewhat too large for me to be called support hose. They went on too easily and didn't provide enough compression. I've worn expensive doctor-prescribed support hose in the past, and it really gives you a workout just getting them on. I probably should have exchanged it for the ""large"" size, but didn't get around to it. My bad!"
4,Support Stocking,"Great compression but vary in amount. Comfortable, more so with a thin sock under them to cushion the open heal. Research shows the knee high compression is as good at prevention of blood clotts as thight highs. This product is great in terms of wear and easing the pain of varicose veins. Launders well."
4,An oldie but a goodie.,"This is still one of the best introductions to the Old Testament despite the fact that much new scholarship has been done since its publication. That's because it treats The Old Testament as what it was. A record of a people who came to believe that they had a unique relatation with God and ultimately came to realize that God is one. Yes, they resembled other tribes and nations of their times. They slaughtered their enemies; they were patriarchal; they even practiced slavery. But it was their crucial insight they made them a people that, uniquely, allowed them to survive through the ages even when they had no homeland.The author avoids the twin dangers of literalism on the one hand, and nitpicking political correctness on the other. In addition it is very well written. I still recommend it highly."
1,Very poor quality and no customer support,I purchased a Seamaster and it stopped working in 6 months. The US service center said they would not fix it because I didn't save the warranty card. It cost me $400 to get if fixed.I would never buy another Omega.
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this. They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content. ""I love birthday parties, yeah"" - ""They're here, let the party begin"" - ""oink oink"".

These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good. The Leappads are worthless."
4,Unbelievable,Unbelievable account of the My Lai Massacre. Who would have thought such a thingcould happen by soldiers representing the United States? Was justice served?
4,Facts behind the facts,"Book did a pretty good job..but always remember there are always things you won't see in a book.This action was taken by a company of the 11th brigade..who had just arrived in Viet-Nam from duty in Hawaii.The worst way to go to Viet-Nam was with a whole Brigade or Division...there were NO experienced veterans with them to help keep these guys alive...and they were taking very heavy casualties,especially from booby traps,ambushes,etc.Most had not even seen the enemy yet!This is not an excuse,but lets not rush to judge 19 year old young men who were seeing their friends die all around them...first thing i learned in Viet-Nam was the women and children were also the enemy..many of our guys were killed by them...I know because i was in the 11th Brigade also at the time."
3,Not what I hoped it would be,"I've read this book three times (all three times while the electricity was out and only a lantern or flashlight at hand) and all three times I've been totally disappointed. This book gives no insight. Nothing interesting crops up. It's boring. But I give it three stars because at least it exists. I suggest if forced to read by candlelight, you turn to the Bronte bios."
2,Not Impressed,"There were no interviews with anyone, just a picture slideshow with narrative. The images that were shown that were ""related"" to Harry Potter were not even correct images. The music seemed to be a bit off from the overall mood of the DVD. Although you did learn some things about J.K. Rowling's life, you have to wonder if some of it wasn't just speculation. The best thing about the DVD were the beautiful Scotland scenes. Overall, watch it, but don't believe everything you see and don't expect too much."
1,Terrible!,"This is a total waste of time and money. Not only is the info on JK a repeat of the readily available known facts, the presentation is long, drawn out, repetitive, and just awful. They only use one stock photo of JK over and over. This is not worth your time or effort at all."
3,A Mild Diversion,"Whilst well-written, I found this to be somewhat too lightweight and lacking depth in its plot. I did like the characters and how they developed but felt that the story itself plodded along and that the romance between the main characters was perhaps a little too chaste for this day and age."
5,Easy Reading,"My daughter picked up a book by this author when we were vacationing in Crete and I read it after she did. It was so funny I sat on the beach laughing so hard tears were running down my face. When I got home I ordered another book from the same author and while it was not funny, it was delightful reading. I usually read spy novels and murder mysteries, so this book was a nice change. I plan to read every book this author, Katie Fforde, has written. She is English so her books are not everywhere in the USA."
2,"Predictable, painful to get through, and main characters had maturity of young teens","Strengths: The plot and setting was interesting. The writing style was light and very easy to read.Weaknesses: From the start you know what's going to happen - you just expect it'll have good twists and turns along the way. But it didn't. While the ending of the story was predictable, it was as though the middle part connecting the beginning and end didn't match at all. The writing didn't help me feel the ""why"" the characters felt or did what they did. The main characters had the emotional level of young teens - couldn't articulate what was on their mind & behaved in an immature and horrible way because they didn't know how to express they liked the other. Ugh - awful!"
4,Slow But Steady,"Fforde's Stately Pursuits starts off slow and had me a bit worried. But, this enchanting story keeps you reading and in love with the characters. A young girls struggle with life, love, family and her career keep the pages moving and your heart hoping that everything will work out. You will be pleasantly surprised by this novel."
4,"A funny, light romantic comedy","This and all of Katie Fforde's books make for perfect diversionary reading. They are wonderful, frothy romantic comedies. The people are real and I often found myself laughing out loud. They're great!"
3,Colorful,This was a cute plot but very predictable. No surprises. A quick read. But if you have issues with sex scenes then be aware. There were some very colorful sex scenes and discussions. Almost makes you feel uncomfortable.
4,"Great Pasta, NOT GLUTEN FREE","I ordered this pasta for a friend who is gluten intolerant. It's NOT GLUTEN FREE- so I ate it, and really liked it. If you're looking for something gluten free, keep looking."
5,Fantastic product,We really enjoy De Boles Angel Hair pasta. It isn't heavy and it is very tasty. My kids are picky and this is the best product we have found to appease their request for quick and easy pasta.
5,Tastes great!,This is the best angel hair pasta as far as I am concerned. The taste and texture are great.
3,Decent for ab video,"Overall, I think this is a pretty good ab video. The only thing I would have liked to be added is more lower ab exercises. After three kids I need extra help in this area and like most videos it just doesn't terget that area enough for me. I was hoping this one would. I LOVE the Turbo Sculpt video, but that one doesn't focus on the lower abs enough either. If you're looking for overall strengthening of the abs then try it. Watch your lower back so that you don't strain it."
5,Fast service and in great condition,The book which I received is in great condition and the service was very speedy. I look forward to purchasing products here again.
3,More like History Book of the TT,"It got so many stellar reviews, so I was expecting riveting commentary, deep production values, and amazing play-by-play commentaries. While the research and entirety of Isle of Man TT was exhaustive, it was quite honestly exhausting. There's a large bulk of the history which only a devoted fan would enjoy, but at some point it traverses from historical review of this rare and dangerous race to simply a narrated almanac of sorts.The TT can truly be broken down into 3 eras (as alluded to by the cover art) and from which they could have explored a more cohesive story-telling instead of the snores-ville in some sections.Pros: Some great footage, rare vintage bikes, in-depth researchCons: Some truly boring parts, feels like it could have been shortened considerably without losing punch"
3,Interesting,"This book is interesting if you are at all interested in the spiritualist camp. Having wandered around Cassadaga many times, I found it very interesting. I know people in the Florida Cassadaga and learning how the camp began was fascinating to me."
5,A great movie,"I just saw this movie on Lifetime, and it was wonderful. I teach, and if I ever teach a women's studies class, this will definitely be must-see for my students. It deals with gender and class issues in a very sophisticated and entertaining way. An original and provocative movie."
4,"Moving, intelligent and complex","Tremendously moving, and ultimately very complex story of two couples - a rich Californiacouple planning to adopt a baby on birth from a poor Southern couple.While the characters verge on cliché at first, and the set up feel a bit `neat', the writingand acting (Laura Dern in particular) is so good that it's the rare film that transcends it'sown stereotypes to find something deeper and richer underneath. There are momentsthat feel a bit schematic and obvious early on, but by the devastating ending that almostseems not to matter."
1,Why cuss Jesus,I was excited about this movie until the opening scene where they cussing Jesus for not winning bingo. Why. It made no sense. I was turned off. A complete waste.
3,Not bad,"First of all, if your a fan of the CC series, then you will probably like this game. It's great to control some modern infantry squads, and armor. Only downfalls of the game I can see are no campaign option, they are all single missions. I really enjoyed the campaign option in the CC series, that made the games for me. Also, it seems, that you cannot choose your forces, that's a bummer also. This game is a good addition to the CC series. To sum up, this game is worth the $19.99, but you can always wait a little while, and really get a deal."
4,The Grape Cure is old but still relevant information,"30 years ago I participated in the Grape Cure diet with a friend who had lymph cancer. After the removal of a lymph tumor, he developed cigar size tumors in the lymph glands under the arms and at the groin line. They completely disappeared after following the Grape Cure fast! Unfortunately my friend was not willing to stay on a raw foods diet, as indicated by the author, and within a year he was dead. I have never forgotten this book, and I was really please to see it was still available though written in 1920. It may not work for everyone, but if I had cancer, I would definately choose grapes over death. If you at all subscribe to ""you are what you eat"" then you will see the simple logic in purifying this way."
2,"Boring, nerve racking new album....sorry mates!","i had hight expectations - maybe too high - as the album isnt too bad especially if you compare it to other death metal combos. BUT this is morbid angel, dude. So what happened after the brilliant formulas album? i dont know. its rather slow paced (no prob with that) but i cant handle the melodies, some of the guitar solos which are rather conservativ metal ones, and the vocals have been better before. only he who sleeps and the victor the spoils do it for me. 1 or 2 other tracks have cool parts but really boring parts too. just my taste, and i can imagine that folk who are really into death metal (im not) will certainly like the album for its crystal clear heavyness and guitat mayem. i personally think its a step back for this band."
3,Fairly weak release overall,"Being a MA fan from day one, I must say I'm disappointed with this release. After the great FFF album, this just doesn't measure up. I found myself skipping through each song the first time I listened to it, hoping the next song would be better.There are a couple standout tracks however. ""He Who Sleeps"" is another ""Where the Slime Live"" type song, which I can't not like. ""At One with Nothing"" has kinda the same slow feel, but not as good. ""Secured Limitations"" is definately one that caught my attention initially; vocals are catchy with a duet of high screams and low grunts. ""I"" also is a cool tune with some crunchy guitar riffing and sweet production sound. The rest of the album is Morbid Angel through and through, but it's the same kinda stuff that we've heard on other albums; not much innovation here. I'm sure the album as a whole will grow on me though, especially after I see them live in a few days. That always helps!"
1,Boring,"Their worst album. It's so boring, it's like the same riff over and over again. Their older discs are great though."
1,No Good,"Morbid Angel is way past their prime on this one. In fact, even when they were in their prime they weren't that great. Sure, Alters... through Domination were good records but they were highly overrated. As for the Gateways record, its just plain boring. There aren't any songs on here that stand out or even get the listener interested. On top of that, there is a creative shift on this album in the form of slow and groove oriented sections in the music that seem tacked on and make it seem that Morbid Angel has jumped on the ""modern metal"" band wagon. If you are checking out Morbid Angel for the first time, listen to Abominations of Desolation (if you can find a copy), Altars of Madness, Blessed Are The Sick, Covenant, or Domination. These are decent enough records and a better representation of the band than what is on Gateways."
1,Defecation from morbid angels,"I think a band of just peices of crap playing instruments would be better than this awful work. The vocals are terrible and irritating, there are no riffs or talented guitar, it is just fast drumming and all around display of toxic-waste."
5,The winds of change.......,"From the first sound of insects creeping to the last cymbol crash, this composition is a masterpiece...Trey is truly a master of his instrument, sculpting and bending it's twisted noises and sounds to make beautiful, sweeping riffs and leads...Like all previous Morbid Angel releases, Gateways To Annhiliation has redefined and broken the barriers...Broken, rigid riffing and odd time changes along with individual guitar lines sculpt original, highly inventive musical compositions...With lyrics and words covering more than the common subjects often found in death/heavy metal music, the reasons for making the music are true...Music for people with a different outlook who can see what can't be seen by most eyes..."
5,((((CRUSHINGLY HEAVY)))),"Not for some of the fans of fast and technical death metal I see from reading some of the other reviews, but, if you like the song ""The Thing That Should Not Be"" on Metallica's Master of Puppets album, then this atmospheric, plodding, rumbling and doom-heralding disc by Morbid Angel just might deliver! Welcome to your doom! This album is far and away the heaviest death metal offering by any outfit I've yet heard in my 4 years exploring the genre. The deep, booming reverberations from this devastating slab of death sludge will leave you flattened under the weight of unfathomable tonnage!For me, this is the quintessential death metal record. No equal!"
4,"great, mega-heavy atmosphere","4.5 stars. An awesome and powerfully heavy Morbid Angel record. The dark, evil atmosphere is in full force. Heavy riffs of doom from Trey Azagthoth and Eric Rutan, powerful gutteral roaring from Steve Tucker. The evil-sounding album intro noise piece sets the mood of the evilness to follow. Then the crushing riffs and drums, benefiting from great production, drop upon you like brimstone boulders, smashing you through the earth, down into the baking depths of hell where the horned Dark Lord appreciates this music. I think this is one of my favorite death metal albums."
3,"Disappointing riffs, but great solos!","While I was thoroughly impressed with the production on ""Gateways to Annihilation,"" I was rather unimpressed with the riffs--extraordinarilly heavy, but incessantly slow and not at all technical. I can dig two or three completely slow-paced songs on any single death metal album, but not ten!I must, however, give ""Gateways to Annihilation"" three stars for Trey's AWESOME solos! His solo work is the only thing on this album that might make me regret returning it. I admire guitarists who solo fast AND tastefully, and who have a style all their own.So if you're into consistently slow, heavy riffs and innovative soloing, with crytal clear production, then pick this up. But if you're a guitarist like me who relishes VARIETY and CUTTING-EDGE BRUTALITY, stick with guys like Suffocation, Broken Hope, and Cryptopsy."
2,Sub-Woofer Problems,"The speakers arrived slower than expected. I installed them, which went quite well and then tried them out. The sub-woofer would not work. I had to call the Supplier (Electronics Expo) and he asked that I call the Infinity tech center to verify that the equipment was bad. I then had to call the Supplier back and get an shipping return lable. The Supplier was easy to work with and propmt they did everything that they could to make things better. But, I then had to take all the speakers down, re-package them and return them. Three weeks later a new set arrived and they worked fine. The Supplier gets good marks for service, Infinity gets bad marks for supplying speakers that were defective. As I have read in other reviews the quality of the Sub-woofer appears to be weak. So far they have been in service for a month without another failure. Time will tell if it was a good choice."
3,"Nice for a 15"" laptop","I have a standard HP 17"" laptop. It does NOT fit in this bag, in the side zipper part where it should go. I read the tag attached to the bag and it clearly states ""Fits Most 15"" Laptops"" Hmmmm... That would have been very helpful to have in the review and specs portion online. I e-mailed DealBarn to see about returning it and I will update their Seller Feedback page once I have completed the return."
3,Not as it seems,"The item i received is completely diferent than what is shown on the pics, the space for the latop even thoug it says it fits most 17"" laptops is not for those is for 15.4"" as stated on the label it came with, luckly the main compartiment was big enought to carry my laptop, i think this has to be review by the makers and make sure they are advertising the correct thing because not even the pockets where they way i was expecting them"
4,"""Airing"" views on Lowepro Transit Backpack","After a couple of weeks of use, the Lowepro Transit Backpack seems like a fine product. However, it arrived smelling like old tennis shoes. A few hours in bright sunshine helped a LOT, but I still get an unpleasant whiff when I open the less-used compartments. I probably will not buy products again from this distributor because I do not like the stink. Attention, manufacturers and distributers: if the product smells bad in your warehouse, it is going to smell bad to the customer. Clean up your operation (literally) to avoid losing repeat business."
5,"Fits my widescreen 17"" with room to spare","My compaq presario CQ60 fits in here fine. Just a mite of trouble getting it in and out, but once it's in there are a few inches of space around the edges, so I imagine an even larger laptop could be made to fit. Also comfortable with smaller laptops. Nice padding on the shoulders and the back."
4,Good price and quality,"This bag is very sturdy and well padded. It fits my 15.4 laptop very well. The Laptop compartment opens from the side, so it I believe it would be difficult to slide a 17"" laptop in to it.Besides that, its been great!!!"
4,I like it,"It fits my macbook pro 17"" just fine. It's funny - it's got an interior compartment which doesn't really fit the macbook really well. But then it's got another, really well padded zipper that runs right up the side. This compartment is not in the main area, but rather, right against your back. That part fits the macbook really well, and you don't even know it's there. It's like a little secret compartment. This leaves the rest of the bag free to put other things. If I had a complaint, it would be that the bag could be bigger. I'm 6'3"" and this bag feels a bit small to me. I wouldn't mind if it was about 15% bigger."
4,"Hi quality, marginally for a 17"" laptop","Pros: A very well-built pack. Unlike many computer packs, this one has foam padding on all 6 sides of the pocket for your computer, so if you drop it, you don't have to hope that it lands on a padded face. This comes with robust zippers and seams, more compartments and pockets than a person is likely to need.Cons (of a sort): As other reviewers have stated, the Lowepro pack is described on Amazon as suitable for 17"" laptops, but mine arrived with a tag stating that it `fits most 15.4"" notebooks'. That is probably the right claim. It did fit my 17"" -- very snugly, which probably makes it safer. However, there are likely 17"" notebooks that wouldn't fit, so select this if you have a smaller machine, or are willing to chance a return shipment. So many zippers and compartments, this pack is a little heavier than some might like."
3,A little disappointed,"This CD was not as great as I anticipated, having grown up with the O'Jays music."
1,"Crumpled, virtually unusable paper","I just received my acadamie tracing pad, and despite it being well packaged, the sheets are crumbled and deeply, deeply wrinkled. I realize that tracing paper sometimes has a bit of wrinkle, but this is virtually unusable. I don't know if the issue is the manufacturer or the reseller, but if zero stars was an option that's what I'd give. Total waste of time and money (thankfully it wasn't a lot of money.)"
5,Great Movie,Enjoyed this movie so much that I bought a couple of extra copies to give away! It can really challenge your lifestyle making you wonder what a person really needs to happy and connected.
5,Inspirational,"What a beautiful and true story. At the beginning, you wonder if you're going to like her character, in the end, you love her. I love this movie."
4,Great educational toy for every kid,Our daughter is 3 years old and we baught leap pad for her b'day and this is first book which she is enjoying. She really enjoys playing with it. Good thig is she is learning all the sounds also while playing. I recommend this book for every kid. She is able to play alone without any help from us.
5,A life line,"This book is a life line for people who continue to be damaged by parental abuse as adults. It is one thing to forgive the distant past of our childhoods, but quite another to put up with abuse as an adult. God bless Beverly Engel for sharing her insights and encouragement. I wish she (or someone) would write another book for people who have NOT been abused explaining why it is inappropriate and sometimes cruel to pressure others, like coworkers or complete strangers, to express love and devotion to their parents no matter what. Would it really cost anyone anything to mind their own business or give another the benefit of the doubt about their most personal choices?"
5,Easy to Understand and Good Ideas,"This book was great. My 3.5 month old labrador retriever already does ""sit"", ""down"" and ""shake"" on command, thanks to this book. He is also fully crate-trained. I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Worthless,"If you are looking for training advice ( and with a title like ""How to Train your Lab..."", what do you expect) this book is a weak rip off. The author has beautiful photos but doesn't actually start to begin the training discussion of any kind until page 39 of a 90 page book..... so 40% of the book is not even related to the title. Weak - would not purchase again, and if I could send it back I would ( and I love books)"
2,Needs much more than what is offered.,"A few cute pictures and basic info that can be found on the web is not something I consider a good read; especially when it involves educating me on the task of raising a life...This wasn't very informative, and didn't offer much more than basic puppy information, and like a few other breed specific books, seemed to be mostly generic information. I understand training a dog is not rocket science, but if a book is lab specific, I want it to clearly lay out issues for my breed and make it as easy as possible to follow along."
2,Disappointing,"""A C-Section Birth Day"" was a big disappointment. For starters, the video lasts only 17 minutes, far too short to show everything it purports to show. The anesthesia scene, for example lasted about two minutes, while the procedure of the C-section only 30 seconds, and then one could hardly see anything at all. I was expecting a descent documentary showing the whole procedure in detail, but instead 80% of the video focused on the new born baby.If you are only interrested in a superficial, quick and general overview of all the steps for a C-section delivery, and want to show it to the younger members of the family, then it's a good video. If you are looking for detailed procedures and comprehensive steps, then it's a big let down and waste of money.The advertising of the video is quite misleading."
4,The Outlaws of Mars,"The book was just as I remembered it from my teens; a fun adventure on Kline's Mars. The hero is transported to Mars by physical means and meets a princess, with whom he falls in love. He finds and comes to lead a tribe of desert nomads against the princess's father's city. A good rousing adventure."
3,Worked very well for about 6 months,Now it won't hold a charge as long as when it was new. But for the price I will just buy a new one.
4,i-Dog bag,Bag is exactly as described and holds the i-dog safely and without interfering with it's function. Would recommend for any girl with an i-dog to protect it in travel
4,Pat Summitt -,II like Pat Summitt wish it covered the later years of her coaching (8 championships). Did not kn ow publication date of book.
3,Good enough to read once.,"Reach for the Summit was an easy read. My goal was to read the book for its explanation of the 12 disciplines which are used for all activities in life, not just for basketball. There were more examples of the disciplins than philosophy. I am sure if one is passonate about basketball they will get more out of it than I did. Disciplines were common sense. Nothing new, but the examples were interesting enough. I thought enough of it to give it to my 14 year son to read. I believe he will get more out of it than I did, simply because of his love of sports. He will benefit from seeing the coach's side of view. Good enough to read through once."
2,"OK, but not for everyone","YES, I GAVE IT ONLY 2 STARS! I have read alot of motivational books in my life time but this one leaves you empty. Patt Summitt does not give a ""one-size fits all"" approach to obtaining Life's goals as she suggest. Pat Summitt gives these long drawn out stories of her coaching experience and players experience then, at the very end, ties it to a generic principle of leadership that has been rehash by hundred of other motivational book writers. I'm not hating on her leadership or abilities. She has proven herself a dynamic coach. If you're a HS/college couch of any sport then this is the book for you! but for the rest of us her approaches to leadership do not necessarily translates to pearls of wisdom."
5,Can I go to Tennesse?,This was the first book I actually enjoyed reading. I couldn't put it down. It inspired me to work a lot harder and try to push to the limit in everything I do. It made me relize how intense The University of Tennesse really is. I would recommend this book to all readers who are basketball fans and especially to who want to go to college on a scholarship.
5,Inspirational and humorous...I couldn't put it down!,"I haven't been captivated by a book in a long time. Curiousity about what drives Pat Summitt to the level of success that she has achieved made me purchase the book. Her down-to-earth style, humor, and love of her job and the students under her tutelage shine thru."
5,A great book about how to be successful in whatever you do,"This is a great book. Pat thoroughly explains the ""definite dozen"" system which she uses to coach her players at Tennessee. She gives specific examples of how the system has affected her players. Great book!!"
4,Candid Look at a Motivating Master,"This book is not only an intriquing look at the approach of a master motivator, but just as important (perhaps even more) it gives insight into how she became that way. I wasn't necessarily a huge Summitt fan before I read the book and wasn't necessarily a tremendous one after reading it either. However in reading this book, I do have a incredible respect for her, her insight into the human psyche, and the principles that make her successful builder of teams and young ladies. Kudos to Sally Jenkins and Pat Summitt for a candid, informative book and a great read."
5,Awesome,"As a 14 year old, I pride myself in not reading anything. Because I have tremendous respect for Pat and love the Lady Vols, I sacrificed my ego and bought the book the week it came out. You don't have to be a Lady Vol fan to enjoy the book. To those people who think Pat is a vilian(sp), you will see her humanized. It is really inspirational, and I could not put it down. I would recommend this book to any person. we could all use a little pick-me-up, and some of the best basketball players ever are talked about. This book was not a normal ""coaches"" book. Pat Summitt doesn't just win by luck. It is definately one of the best books I have ever read.(I read when I was a little younger.)"
3,Balls Bluff,"I was not to familar with the battle and I hoped to learn a whole lot about it. The book was very informative but I got confused many times as to what side was being written about. I wish that someone would write a book where it was easier to determine what side was the subject when talking about the North or South,perhaps different fonts. I was also hoping to learn more about General Stone's fate after the battle. All in all though I was satisfied."
1,quality,Not sure if it is a new item that i got from this KENTEC. box was beat up and tape over many times. The Josef LOGO was also different then original one.
5,a powerful book,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is a celebration of aging, but I'd also call attention to how incisive it is about aging as suffering in our society: and how convincing I found it on replacing despair with quiet exultation. Henri Nouwen always moves me with the deep simplicity of his writing. And the beautiful photographs intervene effectively in the text."
4,Spiritual View of Aging,"Found this to be a positive, spiritual approach to aging. Better than most I've read."
2,Agind the fulfillment of life,"Despite that title is attractive, I did not really find some deep messages in this book. Printed several decades ago, it is quite outdated. Not worth the price I paid for."
1,No educational value,"Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this. They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content. ""I love birthday parties, yeah"" - ""They're here, let the party begin"" - ""oink oink"". This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often. Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it. There is little actual phonics training. The phonics ""games"" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff. These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good. The Leappads are worthless."
1,Bob skates,These are not as large as stated. My son who wears a 13 could not fit these on his shoe. These barely fit mr daughter's size 10 shoe. Also there is no lip or edge to the front of the toe so the shoes slip out. Very dangerous. We gave up and had the kids skate in skates and hold on to a big upside down bucket while they got the hang of skating.
1,Really?,Just take your money and throw it out the window. I bought these for my 4 year old and 3 year old and the skates would stay on for approximately a minute before falling off. I think one child got to skate for 5 minutes. Total waste.
2,No Magic Here,"Note: Original languages are French/Hungarian with English subtitles.Very slow story that doesn't deliver in the end. An updated version of the apocryphal confrontation between Jesus and Simon the Magician, this Simon lives in modern day Hungary and comes to France to work with the French police on a murder case. During his stay he solves the crime, falls in love with a young girl and renews an acquaintance with an old rival who challenges him to a test of magical power. They both agree to be buried alive for three days and see who is powerful enough to survive.You keeping waiting for something to happen but it never does. With such a wonderfully original concept it could have been a great film, but this movie proves that a good idea doesn't equal a good movie."
4,"Name Doesn't Say ""Soul Music,"" But She's All That and More!","For everyone who claims they don't sing them like they used to, here's the CD for you. While her voice doesn't have the power of Artha Franklin (in her heyday), she's just a shade below in her and a little powerful than Glady's Knight in her heyday - somewhere between those two women is Trijntje Oosterhuis.It should also be worth noting that while there are other powerful soulful voices there - she doesn't feel the need to belt out lines just for the sake of doing so - like the best soul singers of the 1960's, she's puts the power of her soulful voice into shading the lyrics and not just showing off how loudly she can sing.If you miss soul music of the 1960's - this CD is both modern and will take you back."
5,Good Greasy Grooves,"Holy organ of my soul, this is a fantastic compilation!!! If you like funky Blue Note jazz albums, especially those that feature a groovalicious Hammond B3 organ pounding away, you WILL enjoy this album. Although it highlights famous organ players (Jimmy McGriff, Big John Patton, Jimmy Smith, Brother Jack McDuff), there are few more obscure artists on here that more than hold their own, plus guitarist Grant Green doing his familiar funky schtick. A track by double-sax player George Braith is also included, but they guy playing organ on that tune is the underappreciated Billy Gardner. Fine stuff. These are good and reasy grooves that will cause you smile ... and probably wiggle a few body parts in the process. Can't go wrong with this CD. It's a gem."
4,Blue note is at it again!,"Blue Note records comes up with another solid compilation of break-beat jazz ripe for the sampling. Featuring some of the sickest keyboard players soloing over funky rhythms, this album will whet your appetite for more of the things Blue Note seems to do so well.No wonder it's the most sampled label in the world.I picked this album up after I'd listened to their 4-disc set of ""Blue Break Beats"" and was still hungry for more. I was completely satisfied."
1,Another great Cynthia Rylant book,What can I say? Cynthia Rylant is absolutely amazing with her Henry and Mudge stories. All young children should have them read to them.
1,dissapointed on price but not the series.,Episodes 1-4 I thought were pricey but they were also extremely wonderful gundam animes. I am anxiously awaiting this episode but will probably be waiting for it to drop in price. My borderline for paying for these episodes was 50 dollars so 100 dollars will just not be happening. its not like these dont end up on youtube and xbox live. I hate paying not owning the episode but I will do what works best.That being said I am completely in love with the Unicorn Gundam series and even already have the banshee Master Grade kit. Seriously hoping for a lower price as this episode just is expected to be amazing with two unicorn gundams.
5,AWESOME EPISODE,Just finished watching my blu-ray and it was was GREAT!! I definitely recommend this to any Gundam fan. I got mine from rightstuf.com so the price is the same as all the other previous volumes. I'm not sure why it is so expensive here. ENJOY!!
2,"Love the series, NOT the price","I have been a fan of the Gundam series for a long time but would never pay this price for ONE episode even on Blu-ray. Complete series plus OVA plus movie maybe but NEVER a single episode. The previous episodes have been a bit pricey but they have been decent considering Blu-ray prices at the time of their release. I highly recommend the series and this show but would look elsewhere to purchase. Amazon has always been my first stop to purchase most anything anime but have found way better prices elsewhere (ebay,Rightstuf,anywhere else) for this series especially."
5,legendary blues,Prime time blues may be the Legendary Blues Band finest recording. Every cut is top-notch highlighted by Billy Flynn's great guitar. Recommended Chicago blues.
3,Read the measurements!,"This isn't what I thought I was getting. It's partly my fault for not reading the listed product dimensions. I went back and looked, and they are accurate. I was going solely on the info that Amazon provided that said it would fit a 1997 Dodge Dakota. It does not...not even close! It was inches too big all around. The quality itself seems good and I will reorder. It will cost too much to return this one, so I'm just out money."
3,A decent starting point,"This book is a good place to start on your quest to learn a new language. It offers some tips and suggestions from the author's experiences with language learning. The book is a fairly brief. I think the paperback version is a bit too expensive, but the hard cover version is half the price. You can find the hard cover version fairly easily if you search at other book stores. Amazon does not seem to have the hard cover version in stock right now.This book is entirely one person's perspective. I would have greatly preferred additional insights from college professors or from people who teach language for a living. I would also like to know any scientific research that has been done in how to learn a language efficiently.This book is essentially a pep talk and a common memory trick, but it is still worth a read."
2,How to learn any language of Mr. Faber,"because I in this book the author writes to much about himself and donot fullfil my expectation no one magic formulathe only thought is study an swet blood,swet,and tears as Mr Wiston said,and profit from the waiting moments,that is all.I am sorry if I cannot expreses clearly but english is no my mother language.I will be waiting better books. bye and sorryFdo- Jorge Merino"
3,Doesn't Fit exactly,"The product doesn't fit the mirror holder from a '93 Camry exactly. The cut was not as shown. It over flowed on one side of the mirror by 2mm so some tape will be necessary. The product comes with only 2 double sided tapes so if you are cautious, you will need to invest in some tapes of your own."
3,"A little flimsy, but does the job","I've used several incarnations of this product and all are a little flimsy but do the job. I'd love a more solid, better quality option, but this seems to be it."
2,I haven't noticed a difference,"If this deflector is designed to help the distribution of warm air in my apartment, I haven't felt the difference yet. Perhaps better suited for vents on the wall or the floor, and not the ceiling."
4,Great for under furniture,"The deflector works great for under furniture. The magnets don't do a great job of keeping it in place, but since it's under furniture its not a problem for me. The plastic is pretty flimsy and probably wouldn't hold up to being stepped on. It does a great of doing what its supposed to."
3,"Weak magnets, but otherwise ok","This won't stick to painted vents unless you have a stronger magnet to add. I used one of these Magcraft NSN0566 1/8-Inch by 1/16-Inch Rare Earth Disc Magnets, 100-Count on each side and was able to install it to a painted vent on a wall. I didn't take off any stars for this, because I had some of these rare earth magnets sitting around.It comes with a ""dust shield"". Looks utterly worthless and I did not install it.I could see it being flimsy when opened to extreme distances, but when properly set up at about 11 inches it is sturdy enough.Other than that it does what it is supposed to do."
3,why is this $30?,"this lens cap works fine, but it's plastic. why should it cost $30? it shatters really easily, but what other choice do you have?"
2,In need of a thorough historical perspective,"Although I have read this book, I guess to the layperson it is needed a historical account of facts before displaying people from former Houses of Europe. The result is a book that appears to be misleading, desined to catch the eye of the middle class low wage worker with photos and a small resumé of the representatives of the so-called former regnant royal houses of Europe."
5,Former Royalty of Europe,"This is an exceptionally interesting book because it details all the more obscure monarchies in Europe. I was fascinated by how these particular monarchies were formed, who ruled, what the political situation were and how the monarchies were dissolved.The information given about former rulers and who are still pretender(s)was very informative. I liked this book because it filled in a lot of the gaps that I have read briefly about. Now, the gaps have been filled in.A must for anyone who interested more obscure royal houses."
5,Come to a world of romance...,"Warning: I am a HUGE Fabio fan, always have been, always will be. Whenever he was on the cover of a romance novel, I always checked it out, especially the magnificent historical artwork. Yes, I am biased, so this will be a review of shameless squee...""ATFR"" stars Fabio in three scenarios as the hero of an insomniac romance author's next book--Viking warrior, pirate, and Italian count(my favorite is the Viking!). At approximately 40 minutes(will somebody PLEASE put this on DVD?)the tape is perfect for a break, and it's always left me smiling.Romance fans, this is a definite MUST. Buy it. You'll thank me."
3,Shower Cady,This product should have had it's dementions listed on the description. It turned out to be smaller than the one I bought locally even though it was made by the same company. Also it seems to be flimsy and won't stick to the shower wall.
1,Not worth the money,Looked like it can hold a lot. Got it and discovered it couldn't hold your standard shampoo and conditioner. Bought another one at Kmart for a dollar less and it holds a lot more than this product.
1,Loss of original lineup hurts RT bad. Where's the songcraft?,"I had heard that Rorschach Test had lost at least two of its original band members before I bought this disc, but hoped that it wouldn't cripple the band's sound. My hopes were misplaced. Bottom line: Same name, different band.The main thing that remains is lead vocalist James's raspy shout -- and if you like that, you may like this album. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all he does, and it's beginning to wear thin. Their last major effort, ""Unclean,"" contained some guitar work and melodic depth that undergirded the punch and power of RT in its prime. Now we're pretty much just left with the shouting -- which reveals a temperament and worldview more simplistic (and pitiful) than any of the hypocracies that RT is attempting to skewer.My advice: Get yourself a copy of ""Unclean,"" and (if you can find it) RT's indie release ""The Eleventh,"" and then move on."
5,A+,Not only did I get a great cd by a greatly underrated band.But the cd was signed by James Baker the lead singer.Talk about a nice surprise.Very cool thanks alot.The only way it could be better is if it was signed by both James and Troee.
4,minus one beautiful guitar sound,"I have to say I recommend Unclean over this album. ""Peace minus one"" definately rocks, but is lacking the melody and good song writing of their previous album. It could be because ""Rorschach Test"" is minus one or two of their original band members, and song writers."
4,Delight,"This is a great movie. If you love Frank Sinatra, you'll love this one. It is a light hearted comedy, with all the charm and pizazz that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin give the screen. You will smile all from beginning to end at all the confusion that erupts. It is must see for all the fans of 1950s and 1060s movies."
1,Film on the Rocks,"Once again, Frank and Dean hold their audience in contempt with this lackadaisical romantic farce. Except for Deborah Kerr and Cesar Romero, no one bothers to show up. Another low point in the Sinatra-Martin filmography - worse than ""Ocean's 11"" and ""Sergeants 3."""
1,Possibly the worst movie I have ever finished watching,"What a waste of incredible talent. I will not bother to rehash the absurd plot - it was terrible, but somehow the movie just misses being ""bad enough"" to become a camp classic. I did not buy it separately - it came in a package of five Frank Sinatra movies - I think it was called the ""Golden Years."" This one was not golden. I suppose you can watch it for the nostalgia value - but you can get that in other movies of this era without suffering through this so-called comedy.On a separate note, based on the Amazon reviews, I find it interesting that this movie was either a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" kind of thing. I hate to discourage someone who might think this was precisely their idea of uproarious fun and merriment."
1,Still Wondering!,"I bought this DVD, and I was sooooo disappointed with the quality of it. When the picture was not freezing it would cut off and return to an earlier episode. I was not expecting anything like this or I would not have bought it. A few nights later the movie was on TV, and I was delighted. Guess what? It also froze up, but not as bad as the DVD, but enough to be annoying. I know it is an old movie, but doesn't Amazon test/check their products before they display these worthless merchandise? I know it is inexpensive, but it still costs me something. It was not worth the hassle to return. My recomendation is that even if it is being given away - walk away or even run away from it. The quality is horrible! I wish there was a no star scoring."
5,Nicer than Embassy Lambskin cover,"The leather and overall construction of this cover is neater, tighter, and pleasantly stiffer than the Embassy Lambskin cover. The interior flaps used to secure the book are sturdy nylon, holding the book securely, while the Embassy Lambskin cover's interior flaps are elastic, resulting in a looser, flabbier fit. Additionally, BeltOutlet's customer service and shipping rates are top-notch! Well worth the extra money!"
1,It should be sewn better,"Okay, let me be fair. There are worse leather bible cases than this one, but still it doesn't imply that it should be sewn so badly. Usually position of a zipper should be more or less parallel to the body-no with this product, the leather connected to zipper in sort of wave pattern. At some places it 3mm from zipper and others its 8mm or more. There are scratches, uneven cuts of connected pieces of leather and so on. In short, it certainly will protect your bible but it shouldn't cost $28. I wanted to send it back, but than decided to keep it-the bible is more important than cover. Still product made very poorly. Here is my advise to BeltOutlet go and look how ladies cosmetic purses and bags are made, how they are sewn, try to make your stuff the same way."
5,Great Bible Cover and Super Service!,I ordered on a Friday and received on Monday via priority mail. The cover fits my Bible perfectly. It is well made out of high quality leather. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Just what I ordered,"Items came in quick time, was just the right size, I thought my Bible was too thick for the case but it fit with no problem. I like the extra pockets on the outside. we will see how well it lasts."
5,Very well made leather book cover,"I purchased 2 leather book covers in sizes medium and large. recently. They are of very high quality, and perfectly fit both of the Bibles that I use regularly. The leather is soft and has a high quality feel, while at the same time is very durable and the covers are well-made in every detail. I would strongly recommend these book covers for anyone looking for great quality at a reasonable price. Some good advice when ordering book covers like this is to be sure to measure the books you are covering, and then allow a bit of extra room for the books to give a little. That way there will be little, if any, strain on the cover itself."
5,59 Years Without One - But This One is Good,"I've never felt I needed a cover for my Bible before, but I recently got a new RSV-CE Bible with a lot of gold stamping on the cover that I want to preserve, so I ordered this cover. It is well made and a bargain for the money. No complaints, but two of the zippered pockets are hard to get anything into and out of when the cover is zipped closed. Minor inconvenience because I didn't buy the cover for this feature.Shipping was no problem, I received the cover in five days."
1,Gross!,"I read the previous reviews and thought I might get lucky and get a good one - but not so! The cover smelled like mildew VERY strongly and you could even see the grey shimmer of the mildew in the large, front pocket. Such a dissappointment. Can't believe they even shipped this one. DON'T BUY! Why does Amazon allow this?"
3,ZIPPER POOR,"MY HUSBAND LIKES TO STUFF A BUNCH OF ITEMS INTO HIS BIBLE CASES. EYEGLASS CASE, PENS, JOURNAL NOTEBOOK...AND HIS BIG THOMPSON CHAIN REFERENCE BIBLE. HE ORDERED THE X LARGE AND A GOOD THING TOO AS IT WAS A TIGHT FIT. AT FIRST IT SEEMED IT JUST WAS TOO TIGHT BUT HE THINKS THAT THE LEATHER WILL STRETCH EVENTUALLY MAKING IT ROOMIER INSIDE. THE ZIPPER IS NOT VERY GOOD THOUGH, A BETTER AND SMOOTHER ZIPPING ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN NICER. THE LEATHER SMELL IS ALSO QUITE STRONG, THIS WILL PROBABLY GO AWAY AFTER A WHILE. I LIKE THE SMELL OF LEATHER, BUT IT MIGHT BE TOO STRONG FOR SOME. WE'LL GIVE THIS ITEM *** SINCE WE ALMOST WERE READY TO SEND IT BACK AT FIRST. IT THE CASE PASSES THE TEST OF TIME WE WILL GIVE IT MORE STARS.THANKShomesteaders in interior Alaska"
5,Perfect Cover for the Perfect Book,This cover fits my Bible perfectly. The leather is soft and the zipper works well. The pockets are good for pencils and markers. I am very satisfied with the product.
3,Leather Bible Cover,"The handle seemed a little skimpy. There was a flaw in the leather than did not effect the usefulness, but is a distraction to the touch or feel of the leather. It seemed this item may have been designated a second or irregular item when inspected by the manufacturer. Otherwise it is useful product."
2,Not happy,"Leather Book Covers / Bible CoversSeller claims item is brand new. It was not used but clearly not new. The metal tag was tarnished and the leather was peeling and scratched, not a pretty site. Appeared to be old in original package. It is not worth sending back but I am ashamed to use this item. I am a very forgiving person but sell a Bible cover, of all things, in this condtion is not right."
4,satisfactory,"A little more snug than I'd like on my study bible (hence 4/5), but generally a good product for the price."
2,broken zippers,The zippers were of very poor quality. Neither of the two zippers on this cover would close when zipped. Packaging made the bible cover feel cheap.
1,UGH!,"What was this person thinking? Do they really feel they can write? My God! How do I get my money back. The pages are filled with sentence over runs - sentences that make no sense what so ever - and grade school level paragraph building. This book is dry and boring. If your a mystery fan, your money will be wasted on this book. I would recommend this author take some basic mystery writing courses at a local community college and then stick to writing for the school paper."
5,Amazing Debut,"Leslie Burbank has shown enormous strength as a writer with her debut novella duet. The two stories meld together to form one continuous story. In Lord Steele, Silke is a warrior queen with the determination of ten men, but it only takes one to bring out the woman in her.In Lady Thunder we meet Aragon, Silke's brother, who just happens to be a beserker. But the wolf in him is no match against the woman who soothes the mighty beast and steals his heart.Full of action and sizzling with passion, Leslie Burbank has done an outstanding job of bringing to life a set of characters you won't soon forget, or want to."
4,Test it !,"ok it's not only great thanks to the music but also thanks to the price, cause now I have bought my favourite cd and saved money for other cd's and yeah the music is worth listening to believe me ! if you love rockjock you'll love this one ! and by the way there are some samples you can listen to if you have real player ! thank you for reading this and I hope it helped you make your choice"
3,"Stupid, but cute.","If you like t&a and gore and can overlook the lack of acting ability of the players, this ain't half bad. Honestly, I've seen worse - a lot worse. Bumbling idiots that they are, the actors manage to pull it off. Basic synopsys: bunch of young adults have a party, some get naked, mayhem ensues, people die ... but there's a twist. The sex draws you in, sure, but stay with this flick. Cool ending. Never saw it coming. What more do you need in a cheap rental? I liked it."
4,one-cd selection,"While this is a fantastic compilation, it's worth noting it is a Japanese one-cd distillation of the original German two-cd set (also available at Amazon). If you like quality European easy listening/jazz go for the two-cd set; it's truly sensational, both in terms of sound quality and content."
1,Park Smart wall guard,"This ""wall guard"" is hard plastic and can not be trimed to a different size. It is actually harder that the dry wall in my garage that I was trying to protect the car door from. do not mistake this design for the desireable soft pads that others sell. you will not be happy with this and the shipping charge to send it back is almost the same amount of money would get back if you returned it - isn't that an interesting coincidence!!! This is not the product you want!"
4,Great wall protector,I used velcro and didn't have to use the screws that came with it to attach it to the wall. It works like a charm and my wife can't scratch the garage wall anymore! Will have to buy one for the back door too.
3,"Too expensive, too short.","I agree with the other reviewers that the length is lacking on these. I ended up buying six of these to cover my base (and walls) in my garage. You do the math. I have a 38 foot long garage so I don't always end up parking in the exact same spot everytime. I also pull my truck more forward if I'm working on it. So I had to get six of them to cover both sides of the garage.I also think there should be holes on the bottom of the bumpers to make them more secure.These should be about half the price that they are. If they were, I'd probably get more. Other than that they work well and have reduced the damage to my doors and walls significantly."
5,Just what I was looking for,With two mounted on my interior garage wall I feel much more at ease when opening my car door.
1,Garbage Product,"These are not as soft as they look. They are hard plastic and they really don't protect the paint on a car door very well considering how rigid this plastic is. What's worse is that just a few days after I installed them, they warped. Now they dont sit flat against the wall. Overall this is a complete waste of money. Adhesive backed 1/4"" thick cork is probably a better option."
4,Works Well,"Have found it works great. Some have mentioned it is ""stiff"" or hard but I found that works well as I am looking to avoid chipping my paint and it does that."
1,"It's a book about left-wing politics, not technology","I bought this book thinking it was about space technology. After all, there's a rocket on the cover and the title makes it sound as though it's about hardware. But this is in fact a political diatribe against U.S. military space policy and our foreign policy in general. It blames the U.S. for not only all evil on Earth, but most of it above. Now, I am myself a strong critic of much of out country's recent actions and the Bush administration, but this book is COMPLETELY one-sided and does not describe any ""tools"" at all. I actually threw it away after reading it, it was just that uninteresting."
2,Nothing New,"Mostly re-hash of media stories, limited new info, some new info on Robert Blakes young life and Baretta TV series"
2,Not what I expected.,I didn't like it at all. The language was nasty and just the whole feel of the book. I felt like much of it wasn't true and a lot was left out.
3,Too little too soon,"The crime occurred on May 4, 2001 and this book was published in August, 2001. Not much was or is known about who killed Bonny Lee Bakely. So the author had to add a lot of extraneous material to make up a book. Then he had to rush it to print, leaving a few typos such as spelling Bonny's sister's name two different ways (Marjerry and Margerry - see pages 96 and 141 ) There are some juicy parts with gripping reading. The author reveals some similarities to the O.J. Simpson case. Both murders were a celebrity's wife and the suspect was a phantom never heard from or seen. Of course until you figure out who really did it! Some interesting stuff!"
2,"Bad, Bad, Bad.","Like the other reviewers I also have a 3 year old who is crazy about Bob; he must have watched 'A Christmas to Remember' a thousand times (me too!!). But this christmas effort is very disappointing. He was so excited by the online reviews and sneak peaks, but has never asked to watch 'Snowed Under' again since seeing it for the first time at christmas. Hated the 'team leader' personality given to scoop - very confusing for my children too. Scenes were stretched, unnecessary boring bits were used to fill the time and the overall pace was slow - nothing to capture a child's imagination and enthusiasm. And way too much yodling too. My 2 year old didn't sit still for more than 10 minutes. Shame."
3,Olympic Bob!,"This is not my favorite Bob video - but my 2 1/2 son LOVES it. Yeah, Scoop is a little hard to deal with, but all's well in the end."
1,Horrible video,"My 2 1/2 year old son received this as a gift for Christmas - he loves Bob the Builder and we have a few other videos. In this story, Scoop becomes a egomanical paranoid freak, which my son finds confusing and upsetting. There are a few scenes where the machines argue and ""camera"" zooms in on close-ups of angry machine faces. This he finds very upsetting and yells for me to fast forward. It sends a terrible message to young children- that someone can treat their friends (co-workers, whoever) very badly, and then at the end, when that person messes up and needs help, is easily forgiven and it is all shrugged off. In addition, the foreign accents assigned to some characters are ridiculous and almost offensive (and again, confusing to my son) and the yodeling is a virtual nightmare. It is just so sad that HIT Entertainment did not produce a storyline with more empathetic characters, and involve more learning. It is a total waste."
5,This puts my kids in action!,"My kids have really enjoyed this toy. It is especially nice for the winter weather when they need exercise, but cannot go out to play. The music variety is nice, the speed variation is interesting to them, and it's fun to see them run, jump, bounce, etc. Unlike a prior reviewer, ours is very sensitive and the slightest movement sets it off."
1,Musini,"My Son almost 4 recieved this for Christmas. Musini is very cute,but frankly after about maybe 5 minutes...It's a big bore!Not only was I bored in less then 5 minutes...so was my Son!"
2,What a letdown!,"I ordered this when it first came out and could hardly wait for it to arrive. The concept was so exciting, and the description was great, so I was sure my (then) 3-year-old would love it. I knew I'd love for him to play a game that made exercise fun.I was disappointed right away. Instead of dancing to make music, my son had to stomp hard. I wound up limiting use to the basement rather than having to listen to him pounding on the floor of his room.On top of that, having to stomp frustrated him greatly. Several times, he wound up stomping on the toy itself. (One of the 2 stars I gave it is due to impressive durability.)Not surprisingly, the toy wound up in a closet and was all but forgotten until my teenager discovered it last week. Now SHE absolutely loves it -- it registers her footsteps with no problem. At least someone is getting some use out of it."
3,quite cool,"I have been reading all the experiences with this and wanted to chime in. We have had our Musini for nearly 6 years now. The volume is quite loud when you adjust it... and for sensitivity... when the air conditioning unit kicks on, or when the heat comes on it sets it off. We just have to remember to turn it off so it does't turn on in the middle of the night.My kids love it, and love bouncing off the furniture to make it play. I have several of the additional cassettes which offers a variety. The only drawback I have is it has to be on our second floor... the playroom has a cement floor which is not condusive to vibration needs."
1,It ended up in a closet the week after Christmas,"This sounded like such a fun toy, and got such good reviews that I though my kids would love it. And maybe they would have if it had actually worked. With ours, you can't ""dance"" to make the music, you have to jump up and down right next to it to get any sound out at all."
2,Sounded like a good idea - but not that fun for my 2 kids.,"My 3 1/2 year old loves music and loves to dance. So, I thought that this would be perfect for her. She does play with this toy from time-to-time (we have owned now for almost 9 months) only when I suggest. Soon after getting the Musini out, the kids always want to turn up the volume. We have it set as loud as it can go, but can hardly hear the music. So, I think that this toy would have been a big hit with my children if it only could play louder."
2,A waste of money,"A friend of ours had one of these and it worked great! It was so sensitive that you could stand across the room and move and the Musini would play. Ours does not work that way at all! Even with the sensitivity turned up to 10, ours still does not play unless you are so close you are practically touching it. The music sound is good when it does play. That is why I gave it 2 stars. It will probably go in our junk pile."
5,GREAT TOY!!!,Once they get over the pushing all the buttons phase - its a great toy!!! Alot of fun for the whole family!!!
1,Never worked very well.,"Maybe we were using this incorrectly, but it never seemed to work very well. Music stopped and started sporadically. Kind of a disappointment for [$$]."
1,Very Disappointed,I've tried adjusting the settings on this toy several times and it still only plays if you are standing right next to it stomping. The only reason it didn't go back was because my son likes to push the big buttons and carry it around the house. I wouldn't waste your money.
2,Kinda Disappointing,"Maybe I misunderstood. I thought this toy played different sounds that you could control with different parts of your body, so you would create an entirely original tune whenever you played with it. All it really does is play one tune, the tempo of which goes faster or slower the faster or slower you walk around (or jump, whatever). My kids never really got into it and now its basically a doorstop."
1,worthless,i bought this based on reviews and am sorely disappointed. you simply cannot hear the thing. my 2 1/2 year twins tried to play with it but were bored because music is so soft. thank goodness it was inexpensive. its relegated to toy graveyard already.
1,Not much magic,"This product does not preform as advertised. Even after reading other reviews and contacing the company, we find that it is not nearly as sensitive as it needs to be.We've adjusted it many times to every level possible and unless a group of kids are jumping up and down continuously right in front of it, it will stop playing constantly.I wouldnt recommend it."
1,UGH!!,After reading some of the other reviews I was very excited about this product. But now I am SOOO disappointed!! It won't stop playing no matter what I try!! And the company is no longer so there is no website/phone assistance to consult for help on resetting the sensors. I even tried toys r us but they have no clue.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Found the switch in the battery compartment and still did not operate as advertised. Old house with hardwood floors, so it should have worked well - - but, did NOT. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It was totally frustrating for my children. It doesn't deserve one star."
3,Not quite as fun as advertised,"I bought the Musini for my musical 2.5 year old son. He spontaneously dances to any music, and makes up lyrics to tunes he knows. I therefore thought that this would be a big hit. I think it's fun, but it sort of confuses him: there is a delay in your action and the response of the Musini which is not conducive to continuous dancing. It appears to be solidly built, and the sound quality is good. We like the jazz the best. Currently, we have it on in his bedroom where we enjoy it during diaper changes."
3,How to turn it up.,"It was amusing how it reacts to the rhythm of every person walking through the room, but I was amazed at how quickly this novelty wore off for the little girl who supposedly loved to dance. Maybe it was Christmas overload. Part of the problem was it was too quiet, until I discovered a way to turn up the volume (I think it was in the battery compartment or somewhere on the bottom)."
5,Why not? It's fun for everyone,"We got this for our children for Christmas (ages 2 and 3) for $10, why not? The adults hade more fun on Christmas eve than you could possibly imagine. What a great idea! Gets everyone up and moving. My kids love playing the ""freeze game"" and holding really still so the music stops for a second. At first they were obsessed with pusing the buttons on the front, but that soon went away and the focused more on the real fun. For the price listed now, I would absolutely recommend it."
4,the kids like it,This is a toy that was bought for the grandkids to play with at our house. I think it should be a bit more sensitive but they don't seem to mind. If the music doesn't play they just stomp their feet when they dance and then it does. And they think stomping is fun. However they do tire of it after 20 minutes or so. It doesn't play on the carpet at all but does o.k. on the kitchen floor. I have to say though I got it at the sale price and with the clarity of the music it was worth the money and I don't regret buying it at all. Besides its something all of the kids can do at the same time so I consider that a good deal. If this one quit working I would buy another one because while they're playing with it they're having a ball. The really nice thing about it is all you have to do to activate it is dance--even the babies can do that and it doesn't take them long to get the idea. A good deal.
4,Static Noise,"We purchased 5 of these for grandchildren, neices, nephews and friends and tried them all out after opening one and discovering that the flashing lights cause it to make this static noise with each flash of the lights. With the sound up loud enough, you can't hear it, but for as great as Neurosmith stuff usually is, I was surprised that this noise is present in all five we purchased. Also kind of frustrating that Neurosmith's ""customer service"" comprises one woman's voicemail who apparently doesn't return phone calls."
1,Bought it twice -- never worked,Great concept that never delivered on it's promise. We purchased it twice and it never worked...a lot of time wasted. The idea sounds good but they need to work on the result!
4,Intriguing but tricky to use,"This is another toy mommy likes better than the children. Perhaps it will grow on them. It is hard to program correctly. It can be too sensitive or not sensitive enough. However, at the current closeout price, I recommend getting it. I feel sad about Neurosmith going bye-bye. They made such interesting things."
3,Neurosmith gets zero stars for compatibility,My boys loved to play with the Music Blocks and we bought several as gifts for family and friends -- we own almost every cartridge -- we were excited to see this new version for older children but were VERY disappointed to find that the cartridges are not compatible -- we most certainly would have purchased additional cartridges for this new toy but are now considering returning it -- what a disappointment from an otherwise stellar company
1,Do Not Buy This Product. The Manufacturer No Longer Exists.,"It does not work. I turned the stupid switch in the battery compartment up, turned the sensitivity all the way up and it still does not work. The boys and I have to stand next to it and stomp at up and down to elicit even the shortest measure of music. It was so disappointing and frustrating for them. I only gave this product one star because there was not an option for any less.When I went to the website listed on the toy, it does not exist so your manufacturers guarantee is useless. There is also no way for me to contact anyone with my concerns and questions. The whole thing is a sham as far as I am concerned. It makes me sincerely skeptical of shopping for anything at Amazon.com ever again."
1,Disappointing,I tried all adjustments suggested and after 30 min. of experimenting the best we could do is get 2 speed variations (slow -fast) vary disappointing
1,Christmas disappointment.,"We purchased this toy for our two toddlers only to find that no amount of jumping, tapping, or turning would activate the sensor even when the sensor was on its highest setting. The only time a second or two of music played was when the music style setting was changed. Fortunately, the problem was discovered during a test run so we never wrapped or put the toy under our Christmas tree. At least the kids didn't experience the frustration of trying to get it to work. It stayed in its packaging and will be returned."
5,Not for use on slab floors,"We recieved this as a present, but the gift-giver did not realize that it takes vibration in the floor to make it work. Our house has a slab floor; we can only use it when we go visit someone else."
5,Not only for beginners,"This is an extremely comprehensive instructional video for all bowlers. Beginners and advanced bowlers will gain additional skills quickly by studying and applying the principals from this DVD to their game. I plan on watching the DVD again and again to keep this info fresh before our next tournament, This being volume #! makes me look forward to locating ""volume 2"" in this series."
2,50% is good for beginners,"The very basic sections of the video are good and would be useful to someone who knows nothing about bowling.However, I found the narration of more technical topics to be poor. For example, she goes into fairly detailed discussions like using arrows to aim and then adjusting your board position (an important topic), but her explanations are not clear and are not coordined with the visual shots. I have bowled dozens of times and found her narration confusing.A recommendation: If you understand the basics and want detailed coaching on all phases of your approach, swing, grip, etc, get this little illustrated book: From Gutterballs to Strikes, by Mike Durbin with Dan Herbst, 1998."
5,Wagner's Carbonara Sauce,My family loves Chicken Carbonara. It is hard to find a package mix that tastes good and that the local grocery store stocks. We love Wagner's Carbonara. Now we know where to find it when we need it. Bought 24 of them so we should be good for a little while.
2,Not what I expected...,"I was looking for a replacement for Knorr's Carbonara sauce mix because the grocery stores don't carry it anymore in my area. Wagner's is creamy enough, but it doesn't have the bacon flavor that I have come to expect in carbonara. I don't recommend it unless you add your own bacon."
2,Not large,"Large to me means demonstration size, over 10 inches. This particular product is NOT large; it its standard size."
2,quirky,"I've owned my Garmin IQUE for over a year, and it is now going back to Garmin again for repair for the 2nd time. The GPS works fine, however the internal memory is way underserved. It is imperative to have additional memory to download the maps. The screen has gone completely dead on me for the 2nd time, and I have handled the system with kid-gloves. I would not buy this unit again, nor recommend it to a friend. The only other user of a Garmin IQUE unit that I know, has also returned his unit for repair. They do not seem robust enough to handle the daily job of being a handheld PDA and a useful GPS system. Customer service is good, when you can get them on the phone; hold-times are ridiculously long...could be over an hour."
5,Garmin IQUE3600 (Discontinued),"Love it once I got the fool thing to work. THIS IS MY SECOND UNIT. My first one died after 4+ years of use. This item has been discontinued which upset me because I loved my first unit. The seller had one that was esentially new. I lucked out.MAJOR problems getting it to work. Turns out my install was complicated by the fact I had a previous unit. After jumping through hoops (uninstalling ALL previous software etc), I got it to work well.As a combination unit, it is great. It does all sorts of things.As a GPS unit only - there are better units being sold today.I hope this unit lasts at least as long as my previous unit.Great product if you want a unit that has several other applications beside GPS."
1,Garmin i-Que 3600 purchased from bigdaddy675,"The Garmin i-Que 3600 unit advertised from bigdaddy 675 on Amazon.com was advertised as being a complete unit in good working condition. I purchased it based on this information. What I received was a defective unit which could not beam or receive infra-red information at all, it has no serial number!!! and it did not have the a stylus, without which the unit is incomplete. I have tried on a number of occasions to contact this seller through Amazon.com without any success over a period of 20 days. I have now placed this credit card purchase in dispute.An extremely bad experience with this seller"
1,Avoid this product and found something else to buy,The accompied CD does not work. I had to call a friend to get a copy. I finally installed. It worked OK excpet that it had been no sound since after a couple of months.
2,Check out Magellan Meridian Color,"I was shopping for a GPS last year. I did a lot of research and considered this one, but ultimately decided upon the Meridian Color by Magellan. In my opinion the Meridian Color is a superior product with superior software, and it retails for about half the cost of the Garmin. I have used the Meridian Color in the US and in Europe and am very happy with my purchase. I would urge you to at least check out the Meridian Color before buying the Garmin."
4,"Great navigation PDA, but stopped working in first month...","As a GPS junkie, I appreciate just how slick this navigation PDA is. The detailed City Select mapsets that come with the PDA are very detailed, and give you voice guided turn-by-turn directions anywhere you want to go. Add a SD memory card and you have more than enough memory to hold all the maps you need plus MP3's and other Palm applications as well. The only drawback, and it's a biggie, is that after 3 weeks my IQUE 3600 has completely stopped working. Garmin has asked me to mail it back to them (at my expense) to be repaired (at their expense). Maybe it's just a bit of bad luck with my particular unit. If navigation was all this unit did it would be worth the money (it costs 1/3 of similar non-portable in dash vehicle nav systems with similar capabilities), but it is also a great PDA and MP3 player as well. If it continues working after Garmin fixes it, I wouldn't hesitate to reccommend it to anyone."
3,Be sure to read the entire manual before you use.,"I got the iQue 3600 bundle as i was moving to a new place where i got a job. The first day i got it, i headed out using the GPS to someones place for dinner (did not read the entire user guide), i put they address in the address book and used the iQue to route the way (bad idea). No matter the place i was supposed to go was in the same zip code, the GPS led me 40 miles away from my destination into the woods and pulled me up into dead ends three times. The other reviews about the battery life are also true. After that day i was skeptical in trusting the GPS but, if you route the way by entering each field in the find addresses location, it is 99 percent times accurate. I have been using it every since and is really good. The Automotive Friction Mount as other reviews suggested is also bad, so try others. Over all i think it is a good thing to have, speacially when heading out to a totally new place."
3,Good in a limited way,"I will make it short since there are already some nice, detailed reviews.This unit is good for automotive, plugged-in use only because of its VERY limited battery life. Even when not in use, whether at home or in car, keep it in the cradle. Else, it will drain itself of battery, lose memory and require re-synching! Limited to this type of use, it is a good GPS. But if you want to get a car GPS then perhaps you should get one intended for that purpose because the pen-based interface of this product is cumbersome to use while driving.If you are hoping that you can replace your normal Palm PDA with this one - forget it (because of limited battery life even with GPS off).So what's special about this Palm-based GPS? Simply that you can integrate your Palm address list with the waypoints of the GPS.Good luck."
5,A must-read from a fellow physician,"Since I am a mom-to-be, and due in November, I have over the course of 7 months purchased almost every baby book written. The Kidfixer Baby Book has been my absolute favorite! This book is a resource that every mom should not be without. It is an easy-read, filled with practical information that many of the other ""baby books"" are missing. As a physician and as a mom-to-be, I learned a lot of new information that I know will be indispensable in the upcoming years."
5,Thank God For The Kidfixer Baby Book!,"My wife and I are expecting our 1st child in February, and this book has really eased our worries about our new baby. As new parents, we knew next to nothing about baby-care before we read this book. Now, I feel like we can handle anything our new baby throws (or vomits) our way. The Kidfixer Baby Book was so easy to read, understand and digest because it was written in such a casual, conversational style. My wife and I especially apreciated the sections in the book that dispell the common myths and misconceptions of child care (no more ""fever phobia""). Thanks, Dr. Altman, for easing our bundle of nerves over our new bundle of joy.-New Dad"
3,not a must-have,"Maybe I just have a lot of common mother's sense, but this book really hasn't helped me figure much of anything out. I read through it while breastfeeding in the early days and enjoyed the author's humor most of the time. I learned some interesting information from it, but honestly have never picked it up for reference since. Certainly it can't hurt to have the book on hand, but I wouldn't call it a ""must-have""."
5,Best of the bunch,"I'm a first time Dad of twins, and a book worm, so of course before the kids came I sampled many of the latest resources out there. While many were pretty good, this was definitely my favorite. Very concise, pragmatic, and most importantly entertaining. I especially love the little ""baby myths"" sprinkled throughout the book."
3,Not comprehensive enough,"This book is probably okay for junior-level undergraduate students who are writing their music papers, but will be too simplified for the more advanced music students who want to produce a good essay/term paper. The parts on 'Documentation' and 'Bibliography' tend to be incomprehensive and outdated. Very often, additional manuals are needed to supplement the lack of information, particularly when it comes to 'Citations.'"
3,Oops Thought It Was Written At A Higher Level,If you have kids interested in SpaceShipOne this book is for you. If you are thinking this book is somekind of history of the program think again. It is a childrens book and is written at about the 6th grade level of understanding.
4,Very good for the price,"These pillows are nice. Fluffy and soft. If you're looking for something that's not soft, then this is not what you're looking for."
1,mean-spirited advice,"If she treats her kids in the same condascending way that she advocates for other parents, her kids are going to be in more than financial trouble.Neal Godfrey has written several better and much kinder books that will get your kids off on the right foot."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Your kids would get a better money lesson if you just handed them the cost of this book and told them to spend it however they chose.
1,Ruthless and Cruel,This woman should be forced to take parenting classes if this is how she treats her own three kids.Kids learn through good advice coupled with kind hearts and caring parents.Skip this book. There are more empathetic and useful money books for parents trying to instill values in their kids.This book is just plain nasty.
1,Terrible product,"This is one lousy vacuum. It spits out dirt instead of vacuuming it up, and my vacuum clogs each and every time I use it. You have to take the machine apart to clean the two filters - a very dirty process. After you finish ""vacuuming"", you will find dirt all over: the dirt that was never picked up, and the dirt spit out by the vacuum.This was a gift or otherwise I would take it back pronto. I didn't know a vacuum could operate this poorly. I thought I could trust the Eureka name. I was wrong. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Piece of junk!!!!!!,"I gave this 1 star only because 0 stars is not an option. I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this piece of junk vacuum!! Like has already been said, it works great the first couple times - then forget it! The dirt and pet hair get caught in the accessory hose and clog it up and it has to be taken apart to clean it out. I get pelted in the ankles with dirt that it is throwing out. The dusting wand is a joke. It constantly comes apart and falls off the vacuum. Save your money - buy a different vacuum!!!!"
1,Had it 1 year and it's going bye bye,"This is the biggest waste that I have ever seen. I just HAD to have it because it has the power paw on it. If I had known then what I know now, I would have gotten it. Please do not waste your money or time trying to vacuum with this product. I burned up more belts in 1 year with this than I did with my old one of 7 years. Also, if I thought that it was picking up, all I had to do was look behind me and there it was...all blown out the back."
3,What I thought every cordless phone HAD,"I just purchased this phone. It is a nice phone considering the price. However to my surprise there is NO MUTE BUTTON!! I thought EVERY cordless phone had a MUTE BUTTON!! Be careful NOT to say what you don't want people to hear. I guess I can't really complain considering the price, well NOT to much."
1,Completely disappointed,"I bought the book in order to familiarize myself with SQL. I am a programmer, and I learn best from reference books, so a book called the ""SQL Programmer's Reference"" seemed like it would be perfect... WRONG.Nothing is organized. Logically one would expect commands to be alphabetically listed. Nope. Okay, perhaps grouped by function? Nope. And what's worse, there are sections for each command in two or three completely unrelated sections of the book.The index is terrible. The examples are pathetic. Even the grammar is to be laughed at. As stated in other reviews, this is the perfect example of a lousy book. Not only would I recommend avoiding this book, but also avoid anything else written by this author."
1,Poor at Best,"I find the book poorly organized and lacking information. The examples are poor and the rest appears to be a collection of pieces of a reference manual. The cover states that it covers multiple DB platforms, meaning bits and pieces from Sybase and Oracle and complete for none."
4,Good Content but could be better organized,"I am a student of Oracle and found the book to be very useful and handy for quick references. It is well written and can be a useful desktop reference. However, the organization of the book could be better. The keywords section should be with the main content."
4,They're alright,"They work ok, but I've already started to notice holes and fraying in these after a year. I'm not the biggest fan of how hard it is to... gain access... to the goods. All in all though, not a terrible price for them and I'd probably buy them again since they fit well and are comfortable."
5,Excelente,"Este producto es buenísimo, la textura de la tela es muy suave sin perder lo fuerte y resistente que es el algodón, los colores perduran aún después de varias lavadas, la resistencia es superior al promedio en este tipo de artículo."
3,"Nice, But Too Rich for My Blood","I've seen these in person and they are high quality. But where are the used ones? Can't Amazon find any used ones for budget-minded shoppers? I'll just keep making my own look-a-likes out of leaf bags, thank you very much.Hefty Twist Tie, 39 Gallon Lawn and Leaf Bags, Case Pack, Six - 23 Count Boxes (138 Bags)--Nearly 5 years worth of homemade underpants!"
5,perfect,description is perfect. they run a little small in sizes but it wasnt a big deal. i would def buy more
4,"Well, what would you think?","It's underwear. From Fruit of the Loom no less!The good thing is that those crazy fruit guys don't come with it. They are pretty large so I imagine that would have made the shipping costs nightmarish. The underwear came alone in the package and... wow, that just happened.Offering the best of the boxer and the brief, from a well known brand name for fruit people and undergarments, what more would you want when you aren't alone?? You can stand proud in these, just mind the sock-gap."
1,Bad quality,"I was wearing it to sleep, next morning I found I big hole on it, don't actually knows if it came ragged, I was to sleepy to notice last night, just know that it was ragged in the morning :-"
2,Legs are short.,I ordered these for the advertised 6 1/2 inch inseam. Returned these because the inseam is actually only 2 9/16 inches.
4,"Ignore ""See Merchant's Sizing Chart"" Link!","As the previous reviewer pointed out, the Amazon sizing chart will definitely steer you wrong. I will be returning these for the next smaller size. Here are the actual sizes:Small are 30-32 (not 28-30)Medium are 34-36 (not 32-34)Large are 38-40 (not 36-38)XL are 42-44 (not 40-42)XXL are 46-48 (not 44-46)"
1,Poor Design making it uncomfortable,Seams on the rear make for uncormfortable sitting and gives a person with a rear end have a super wedge.Also not supportive in other spots that need it.The leg coverage is shorter than product pictured.
2,Fit didn't last one wearing,"Right out of the package they fit fairly well. I wasn't expecting perfection for the relatively inexpensive price, but the fact that the bottoms of the legs were extremely loose after wearing them only once is a huge disappointment. I can see some slight stretching, but after wearing them once they went from snug to having over 1.5 inches of extra room at the thigh. Washing & drying brought the size back down slightly but did not last.I won't be buying any more."
4,Comfy & Cute,"They're soft and fit well, not too expensive, and look good on. You can't really ask for more out of a 4-pack of boxer-briefs."
5,Good value,Initial impression is that these are a great deal. Didn' t wash any yet but fit and quality are very good. I bought medium with my 38 waist and they are not too tight. I expect some stretch with washing.
2,one pair ripped on 2nd use,"In general I like these. They are comfortable and fit well. However, one of the four pairs ripped on only my second use right along the seam (inner thigh). They are not so tight that this should have happened."
3,So so...,"The Amazon was fantastic, but fulfiled all that promised. Thanks!The game is not good. That's a shame!!!Joo FreitasRio de Janeiro/Brasil"
3,Pretty Good,"Basically it's God of War except Conan the Barbarian is the main character. Power ups are the same, as well as earning blood to buy new moves and upgrades. Over all it's pretty good if you like this type of Genre."
3,Its a old hacker in the god of war theme!,If you like god of war you will like this game some nude girls well topless any ways. Its got a lot of moves I havent figured out yet I bought them but cant make them work I guess buy it and try it Im not much help till I play it some more but like I said god of was conan style
4,not bad,"Along the likes of God of War or Dante's Inferno.Endless, mindless slashing of enemies. Sort of boring after a while.Last boss is retardedly hard and will piss you off.I would pay no more than 10-12 dollars for this game.To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of the women"
4,Fun game,"If you like the Conan license you will really enjoy this game. If you dont you will complain about it being a god of war clone, the enemies being repetitive and the glitchiness in some spots. If your like me you wont care and just enjoy being Conan for a while and hacking opponents up with some neat combo moves!"
2,Just okay,This game is okay... It was fun at first but all the button mashing got old fast. If your a fan of Conan get it if your not don't waste your money.
2,I am late...,"I just bought my first Ps3 on Dec 2009 and I decided to start from the beginning so I bought not only 2009 games but 2008, 2007 and even 2006 also. I love hack n' slash games but I think I am late for this game, probably I would love it if I've played it 2 years ago, but on Dec 2009 this is just a mediocre hack n' slash. There is a lot of blood and gore wich is great but the gameplay is not enough."
4,A 'God of War' style game,"Hi. I bought this game just waiting for the next God of War for the PS3 and I don't regret. This game is a clone of GoW but it doesn't have the same game quality, but I recommend it to all who like this type of game anyway, and it's not expensive. Go for it ! (Adults only)Que tal. Compré este juego particularmente para entretenerme mientras sale a la venta la siguiente versión de God of War y no me arrepiento. Es muy similar al GoW pero no tiene la misma calidad de juego, aún así lo recomiendo para todos los que gustan de este tipo de juego, con la ventaja de que no es costoso. (Solo Para Adultos)"
2,Conan the letdown,"I bought this game for two things: Violence, and boobies. The game served mediocre amounts of either, and even worse, created little fun at all. This game is worth paying $5-$9 for.The reason people compare this game to God of War is simply because it tries (blatantly) to be GOW, and sadly comes off as just a cheap knock-off. The game is short, repetitive, and boring on many levels. The combo system is very primitive, the game absolutely linear, and overall art style is very generic.I'm not going to do a full on review, because others have already done a great job at that, but just really wanted to put my two cents in.The minimal fun level of violence, and the naked babes (that disappear once you turn away)can't save this game.Save your money."
2,Don't waste your time,"I just bought this game earlier today. After about an hour of playing this crap I've decided to take it back to Gamestop. Paid less than $20 for it and I still say it's garbage. The music is bland. The graphics are horrible for a PS3 game. The only things I like would be the ability to slice enemies in half, chop off arms, and blood spilling everywhere. As fun as it may sound to dismember an opponent, the graphics are so weak that you really can't enjoy it. Do yourself a favor and stick with God of War. I would also recommend Wolverine or Heavenly Sword."
1,conan,"this game takes gaming a step backward, it can't touch Heavenly sword for graphics or game play. I think the best part of the game is the cover graphics. the entire game is the same thing with different background scenes. boo"
2,"Dude, there's a glitch, so I couldn't even finish the game!",LAME LAME LAME! That's what I get for buying a mindless 'hack and slash' with absolutely no thought or effort put into it!
4,Not going to win game of the year awards but...,"The game is pretty good and I think it is fun to play. The boss battles are engaging. The graphics look pretty good. The controls are fairly tight. The sound is OK, a bit repetative after a while with all the one-liners Conan spouts off. I like how you gain XP to learn new moves and the different weapons you can use that bring in different styles of play. It's no Ninja Gaiden, mind you, so if you want to own the best Hack-n-Slash game on the PS3 go for Ninja Gaiden Sigma. If you want to play as Conan or like the low fantasy setting of Hyboria, this is the only show in town till Age of Conan is released in Mar 08.Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures"
3,So so,"This is the first game that I have ever beaten in the PS3... and I would say, I did not like it very much. If you want a slayer game, get Heavenly Sword which takes advantage of the PS3 hardware."
4,good action game,"If you like gore and action this game has it. It plays like god of war but with more blocking counters with gore added to it. the story graphics aren't the best but the gameplay graphics are pretty good. The story is ok not the most thought out story I've seen but it worked. the game is still very fun to play even that I had to start it on hard lever just to be able to get some challenge out of it, but that's because it plays like god of war which is my favorite game that I still play. I still died acouple of times so not bad. I grade it a B- almost c+"
5,An obscure influence of countless Jazz and Rock musicians,I heard about Szabo through an interview with Carlos Santanna. I was hooked the first time i heard his westernized latin rythyms.
5,A great book for non-Muslims as well!,"We get so little information from our media on the largest pilgrimage in the world, that this book is a revelation. Islam and the Hadj are an integral part of the history and culture of the Middle East, and by extension, our world.The photography is nothing short of stunning, and there is little that is not covered, so that one gets a good sense of the topography, the rites, and of course, the pilgrims.An essential book not only for Muslims, but perhaps even more for non-Muslims looking to understand one of the world's great faiths.I will never, as a non-Muslim, be able to visit the holy cities, but this book was the next best thing. Flawless."
1,"Where blacks went for pilgrimage, and ended as slaves","The book intends to glorify two cities where for centuries, black men and women from Africa would arrive as pilgrims, are abducted, and sold as slaves and concubines to Arab masters. This shameful slave trade in black human beings is very much a part of the history of Mecca and Medina, as it continued well into the twentieth century. Yet the book keeps a grotesque silence on this human tragedy"
5,An Inspiring Book and a Motivation for all,"This book is great. I enjoyed reading it, it contains some to the point and accurate accounts of what happened before and after islam. The pictures are some of the best I have ever seen. It brought tears to my eys from the sheer magnifigance of the photos and the Kabba and the prohpet's mosque.Recommended for Muslims and No Muslims alike."
4,A Delightful Collection of Rarely Seen Places & Rites,"This is a must for all Muslim families, and all curious non-Muslims. I've given this book as a gift a number of times. The photographs of these rarely seen places and rites are powerful and intriguing. The only reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is I would have liked to have seen more of a pictorial history. For instance, there is a diagram of the growth and construction of the Prophet's Mosque through the centuries. More of that type of information, along with more historical photographs and drawings would have really completed this work."
3,It Could be much better,"This book is one of the rare pictorial books abouth the two holy cities from Islamic point of view. It is basically the Hajj in pictures. Book is very well put together but I expected more pictures and better exposures. There are considerable repeat pictures. The night exposures are dissater, there are not enough real life situations from Hajis.If you buy this book as Anatomy of Hajj and visual visit to Holy sites you might be dissapointed. Real Life conditions during Hajj is not depicted.If you buy this book for rememberance of the days of Hajj that you might have had or you wanted to learn before you go there, you are up to a big dissapointment as I did. It is a mixed bag. Detailed pictures of daily life is missing. The Tents, Mina, Arafat, Streets of Mecca are not covered properly. Only well known pictures are in the book as though they are distributed from same source."
5,cos like you've never seen him,"I saw this made for TV movie just one time in 1971, when I was seven years old. I only knew Bill Cosby as a comic actor, and was stunned (yes, a seven year old can be stunned now and again) by his performance. I never got it out of my head. Last year I found this heart wrenching film, and discovered it was the same movie I saw in my youth. I was again amazed at how powerful it was/is. Now being a father myself, it's message is even more meaningful. Take a chance, get this movie and share it someone you love. It will definitely move you to tears."
1,Sounds of wackness,"...man, is this the best y'all can do?....If U want 2 hear somethin' that groovesbuy some P-Funk, Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield,Stevie Wonder or somethin'....this is wack yo!George Clinton's armpits are funkier thanthis junk"
1,Sounds like a bunch of yuppies jamming,In my opinion they be faking the funk.Even my grandmacan git-down better than these hippy wanna-beezers.Funk is it's own reward....nuff' said
4,essential skills for sight reading guitar,Good but needs more excercizes with notesand reading instead of just one or two timesreading all the notes at once.Book is good though
1,This thing SUCKS!,"My brother bought this and I wish he would have researched it a little before buying it because it is the poorest made wireless networking product I have ever used in my 15 years of IT work!It will show up on the network, then disappear, then reappear, etc. We've wasted countless hours trying to get it to work. Please do not buy it! The person who actually wrote a ""positive"" review of the device was using a different one. (This is regarding the TEW-P1U.)"
1,Run Away!,"I am a professional computer tech. I own my own business and have over 20 years experience. This is one of the worst designed products I have seen in years. A friend bought this item from another vendor, ran into trouble and asked if I could help. I spent 10 - 12 hours on it with no luck. It would print as a standard print server OK (though very slowly) but it simply would not work in wireless mode. And yes, I have done many wireless installations.I am not sure what product the guy who wrote the positive review was using, but it wasn't this wireless print server. For starters, there are no switches on it.I recommend the Linksys WPS54GU2 instead."
2,Agree with previous reviewer - terrible instructions,"While the product appears to work like a charm, the instruction manual is not only incomplete, but almost incomprehensible. It appears to be some Asian language translated back into English.If you buy, do yourself a favor and call tech support for installation."
1,If you are a Mac user - Run!!!!!,"This adapter is supposed to work with Macintosh and Appletalk. If it does, nobody at Trendware is aware of it. They sent me to a college website to get information from their computer lab. Arrghhhh!!!!! When I tried to configure the print server manually, Trendware tech support could not even tell me what values to enter into the fields. The only reason I can see for a Mac user to buy this product is if they are obsessive compulsive and need something to do."
1,"Very hard install, not user friendly","You will spend hours installing this one. The manual is only a few sheets about the installation ""wizard"" and is written in chinese-english. No help from the manual. Your on your own."
4,Very interesting film,"If I'm not mistaken, I got this movie for two or three bucks at Big Lots and figured what the heck? If I didn't like it, no big loss, but seeing that Deborah Kerr was in it, how bad could it be? Trust me, I didn't see this one coming. I expected 1950s melodrama with not much substance, but at least some good acting. I was so wrong. As the film unfolded, I was given a lot to think about and when it was over, I was left kinda wanting that last layer to be peeled away. The beauty of this film is not only the lovely Deborah Kerr, but also the fact that the ending wasn't wrapped up in a tiny, perfect bow. Life is quite complicated and sometimes our actions and reactions makes it even more so."
3,"Interesting story, male lead misscast","This movie only gets a three-star rating because Van Johnson was a lousy choice as the ""leading man"" in this movie. The story is interesting, and Kerr's portrayal of the enigmatic diplomat's wife is flawless. But, Van Johnson cannot carry the paramour's role with credibility. John Mills in the supporting role of a hired PI, carries his role in an understated, believability. The story, set during WWII London is well-written. If i were only judging Kerr's role, i would give it a full five-stars, but Johnson is not believable as her lover."
4,Enjoyed this movie,I had not seen this movie before and took into account the reviews on Amazon when I made the purchase. I enjoyed the movie.
4,the end of the affair,"Movies has very well acted and produces, the movies put me into the time period of the ploit of the movies"
5,Student,"This book is chalk-full of tons of information!! It tells about almost every recorded crime, including famous ones such as The Black Dahlia, Charles Manson, and Jack the Ripper; including an interesting turn on who Jack the Ripper really was. There are also a couple pages of pictures from crime scenes such as Madeline Smith, Leonard Lake, John George Haigh, and the trial of Ted Bundy. If you're looking for an interesting read and you love forensics and crime, then this is the book for you!"
1,Junk and Psychobabble,Don't waste your time or money in this psychobabble stage analysis. Simpleminded in the extreme.
2,uhhh ok,"Leon claims to be responsible for preventing the destruction of the leaning tower of pisa. but in actuality, it was a man named Young Oak Kim, who was recently declared by msn.com as one of the 16 greatest american war heroes.He was a member of the U.S. 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and a combat leader in Italy and France during World War II. He was awarded 19 medals, including the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars, three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Medal of Military Valor, a Légion d'honneur, a Croix de guerre, and (posthumously) the Korean Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit.*where is Leon's merit acknowledging his heroism? lol. he doesnt even have a wiki page. he's a skilled writer, making CASH off his first hand experience. YOUR MY HERO LEON. you crazy reptillian you."
5,Try it you will love,check out the free Canadian living app for smart phone it to is great.American or Canadian this is great reading.
5,Not only for women!,"I just finished this book and was simply amazed at how much I learned from such an interesting and easy to read book. Ms. Barrett was able to take complex issues and make them actually ""fun"" to read by the way she brought in real life stories as examples. This is a book that men and women should read because it raises one's awareness as to steps that each of us need to take to protect ourselves. I just bought a batch of the books so that i could give my family and friends a copy as I think everyone should read it! It is a gift that you can, and should, give to those you care about."
1,disappointment,"This dvd was a real disappointment. The only good thing with it was the background music. The only panther you get to see is so skinny that one wonders if it ever was fed. A deer is also seen running, but the photos were taken from an airplane. The manatees were OK to watch and the Everglades also. On the whole I must say it is not worth the money. It would help if somebody narrated a DVD like this. Unfortunately this is not the case here."
3,Anne Mather gives up Maury show in a romance,Heroine was an overemotional nitty who ran and married the hero's brother because the hero had to go to South America because of an accident at a site. Oh and she had a little secret that would win her a spot on the Maury show...Things you may or may no like about this book:1.Keeping it in the family. The heroine sleep with a set of brothers which kind of reminds me of Gypsy from Carole Mortimer.2. Hero smokes
3,Anne Mather,"It was six years since Julie had married Michael Pemberton and left England - and Robert. Now Michael was dead, Julie and her small daughter were home again - only to learn that Robert was now the child's guardian. So Julie would have to accept Robert as part of her new life. How could she bear it?"
4,Great movie,"I never heard of this movie. Didn't know that it even existed until today. I was flipping looking for a picture to watch, and this came up and it was something. I could tell from the get go that something was definitely amiss in this case. I felt that perhaps something wrong something else was being covered up here. I couldn't understand it, but you couldn't 'help but feel the tension. The actors, Courtney B.Vance, Charles S.Dutton, Kadeem Hardison as the three brothers who were in deep conflict with each other was great. Lonetta McKee and supporting cast gave it their all and sadly what is a good movie just don't have much press and should be shown."
5,Blind Faith,"Yesterday while flipping channels I came upon Blind Faith. My good fortune. What a powerful look at race and racism in the 1950's, family dynamics, sexuality and the phobias attached. Charles Dutton, Coutney Vance, Vonetta McGee, Kadeem Hardison( i probably botched the spelling) and all the actors associated with this venture provided strong believable characters. Having been a child of the 50's this film brought back memories of what it was like. Not all good memories. I wanted to shout about this movie with others and found out that neither Blockbuster nor Netfliz has this movie in stock. Why????? If you have the chance to see Blind Faith you will not be disapointed. This is a must see for those of us who do remember and those who must remember when!!"
4,A soundtrack to smooth,"This CD is packed full of smooth jazz essentials and some other rare cuts. An impressive album issued by the London Radio Powerhouse - Jazz 102.2 known as Jazz Fm. Great music at home or in the office the album is only slightly missing in its representation of older more established genre artists, but if you could only have one smooth jazz CD this would be it."
2,Not a CD,"This is not a CD. It is an ""Enhanced CD"" which means it wants to run a software program in order to be heard on your computer. After all the mess Sony caused with software 'enhanced' CDs, I am very upset with my purchase. I thought I was buying a music CD, not a software progam that plays music and does who knows what else to my computer. If I can find a way to send this back I will.I listened to the song on a regular radio, and its pretty good. If you only use a radio, then this will be fine for you."
2,For Uschi Digard collectors only.,"The film is basically footage of ""Dr Christina"" walking around Paris with three sex scenes shot in California spliced in. No sync-sound; just a female narrator and some jazz music endlessly repeated. Thankfully, the Uschi Digart footage seens new(and not lifted from Roxanna or Pleasures Of A Woman,as I thought might be the case) Two other women who MAY be Jane Sentas and Donna Young appear as well. No trailers are included, despite the claim on the package. The 2nd feature? An ultra-cheap hardcore short with no recognizable faces. But hey, it had actual sound!"
4,A whimsical coming-of-age film,"""Experience Preferred but Not Essential"" is a joyous little film that celebrates the thrill/heightened reality of coming-of-age as well as the quirkiness that's often revealed when taking a nostalgic look at the behaviors found in the workplace. The story does an excellent job of capturing that initial bloom & excitement of youth-at-the-edge-of-adulthood and all the accompanying wonder. And everything about this production (acting, direction, script, sets) is well-made and entertaining. My one (minor) complaint is that it it's too brief (when was the last time you thought that about a movie?) as it clocks in at about 75 minutes.Sadly, this film is difficult to find as it was only released on VHS in 1984 (and there don't seem to be many copies remaining). Yet another good production that's long overdue for a DVD release."
2,The Thursday Friend.,"I Read Catherine Cookson for the life stye and normes of era portrayed.Much like an Agertha Christie,although not nearly as engrossing.This book boring ,preachy,and unconvincing.I found it difficult to finish."
3,"""The Thursday Friend""--Disappointing","This Cookson novel, ""The Thursday Friend"" turned out to be a disappointment for me--a very personal reaction. I was expecting something like ""The Dwelling Place."" While her style is recognizable here, and the dramatic violent episode is present, as in most, if not all, of her books, I did not care for the plot or the characters. I found the hero and heroine rather tiresome. Most of Cookson's works possess a wonderful vitality; this one seemed artificial."
4,A Nice Read,Really enjoyable book.Love the simple way these 2 people met and how the friendship grew through the grandchildren. Just 2 lonely people seeking friendship.The book would be suited to the 45 + female age group.
1,"Sticky, and left me with an allergic reaction.","I bought this product from another store, and didn't use it for six weeks which was silly. I tried it 3 times and had the exact same reaction on each occasion - my skin started itching to the point where it became unbearable and I had to take a shower to scrub it off. Also, this didn't leave my skin feeling soft or moisturized at all. Just slightly sticky. I can't say whether or not this is generally a good product, but it's definitely bad value and I'm unlikely to ever buy Mustela again."
2,Incorrect information on this author,"I would appreciate it if the publisher of this work would contact me through this site or through wbbooks at hotmail and advise how an author might get correct information to them so that the info placed in this online edition is correct. I am supposing that the publisher of this title took information floating around on the web and compiled this as no one ever contacted me. I would say that much of what is written about me is just plain wrong. So, if I could hear HOW to contact you so that I can send send correct information, I would like to do so as it is troubling to have incorrect information about oneself published as fact. I'll be waiting, and thanks... Jean Sasson"
5,Pure artistic expression that gnaws at the soul!!,Less of a musical masterpiece than it is a piece of art. This purely digital conception conveys pure dark beauty. Mortiis creates an ambient atmosphere that forces the listener to explore his/her darkside.
3,Mortiis Rocks!,"This album is very good but it's not something that you will hear every day. This is ambient music, very very DARK ambient music."
1,wtf?,"TRASH. Want mood music? Get My Dying Bride, Tristania or even Finntroll...anything...I'd expect something better coming from an ex-Emperor member."
4,Destroying Hippies One at Time,"I must say I bought this game right away because we enjoyed the first one so much. I love the game and had a ton of fun playing it. However, the commentary was just too long and it took us just a short time to beat the game.However, there are lots of things to do. Lot's of interesting and annoying remarks! If your looking for an interesting game buy this game it was a ton of fun!"
2,Yawn.,"I purchased DAH2 because I grew tired of the scenarios in DAH1. I was hoping for something a little different. Maybe I've just outgrown this game; but, honestly, this thing is just as limited as the first one.Product came in good time and excellent condition."
4,D.A.H. 2: = Could Have Been Better,"Destroy All Humans 2 is not as good as the first game of the franchise. I don't think the creators tried their best on this game. It's O.K., but the graphics aren't as good and the background characters are one dimensional and way too stereotyped. The sound of some of their voices is very annoying. This is compounded by hearing them repeat the same tired phrases over and over again. You should only purchase this game if you are a serious fan of the franchise or can get it very inexpensively. I'm still not done playing this game and don't know how it compares to later editions of the series. Any comments?"
3,Could be better,"While the plot is very sci fi and the action passable, the controls are difficult and things can get repetitive quite fast. Would be an OK game if you want to see E.T. take revenge on those earthling menaces!"
4,Destroy all Humans 2,"All my son did was talk about the first version so when I found this one at such a cheap price, I had to go there. He is very happy and his sister plays too."
4,Great book with lots of exercises for review,"Good, very simple book with lots of exercises to practice writing skills and test your knowledge. The book's binding was falling apart when I got it, but Amazon refunded my money on it, which was great."
5,A must have for a Doors fan,I have been a Doors fan since hearing them for the first time back in 1967. I have original memorbilia. This is the definitive film about their amazing rise and crash from stardom.
3,HWY,"The sparklingly clear footage of Jim from the never released movie, HWY, is worth the whole thing. Why they didn't include more of the footage from the film here in this documentary, and why it has never been released, is beyond me. The Johnny Depp narration is a cliche, both pedantic and trite--an ebarrasshment, as is the boring cliches about the tumult of the 60s. Besides the HWY footage, there is some rare stuff from a Long Island performance that is fascinating. Would have been best to just have featured all of this rare footage and axed the narration and boring platititudes about the band."
3,Little New Here,"Yet another opportunity to make a descent Doors film wasted. Outside of the footage from HWY, I don't think there was anything new in this film. Same old clips mixed in with nude chicks and Viet Nam. The narration follows the well worn, sensationalistic and often distorted path of Stone and Sugarman delivered by Johnny Depp in an emotionless monotone. This wouldn't even rate three stars if not for that fantastic footage from HWY. Why wasn't that film added as a bonus? Perhaps they're saving it so they can squeeze yet more money from Doors fans. In any case, unless you don't own any videos of the Doors, you should save your money. As an earlier review stated, this is pretty good if you make a Doors mix and watch this with the sound muted. Perhaps someday someone will finally do this right."
2,High expectations for this which did not deliver,"I have been waiting for this DVD ever since I started to read Tom Dicillo's blog.First of all I found Jonny Depp's narration completely irritating and distracting. This film should be about the subject which is Jim Morrison, and I find that the narration distracts from the subject.Second I expected way more concert footage (There is none) and what I see is a loosely connected bunch of scenes mostly which are available on You Tube.Thirdly this seems to be dressed up to sanitize Jim in a way that we see the good side.The Doors hated the film made by Oliver Stone, but the reality is that drama always tells a story, for lack of a better term, more dramatically than documentary can ever do.I am an avid Doors fan and can recite Jim's poetry chapter and verse and I love their music and have done for 40 plus years.This DVD was a chance for something really great. Instead it is a big disappointment. Sorry guys."
5,Love the Doors,"Had seen this on American Masters, recorded it and subsequently inadvertently erased it.Glad to have been able to get a copy of it.Item arrived exactly as advertised. Would definitely do business with them again."
2,The Ceremony Never Begins,"Narrated by Johnny Depp, ""When You're Strange"" (2009) is a muddled Doors hagiography notable for its previously unseen footage and the lack of a single interview. Writer-director Tom DiCillo has essentially given us a condensed remake of the 1991 Oliver Stone film - with the genuine Lizard King in all his chaotic glory. Unfortunately, there's no attempt at structural clarity or historical accuracy. The fact that the Vietnam War gets more attention than ""Morrison Hotel"" says it all. Meanwhile, we're still waiting for a definitive documentary about The Doors."
4,essential,"This production has weaknesses, but it also contains some of the essence of the Doors experience. That is largely thanks to Jim Morrison's own amateur film, which provides the the framework of the narrative. Morrison's production, in which he plays a predatory car thief prowling the highways, evokes that time, era, and scene.Of course, it is also a projection of the dark and compelling Morrison, whose presence looms large throughout. As a fan of their music from back in their day, it was a treat to see them again, in newly-released footage. And I liked it better the second time."
1,"Don't Bother, listen to the Albums","This is a complete POS, do yourself a favor & beg,borrow,steal or buy their CD's or dig out your old Doors Albums and just listen to the magic.This is a shallow,exploitive, rip-off, Jim would be turning in his grave, shame on you.Ughhhh !!!"
1,??,"Since I do not own a blue ray DVD player,I could not view this item.I also did not recieve a refund for the DVD and the postage to send it back..hopefully I will see it in the future."
5,simply essential,"I have four recorded versions of 'Mary Did You Know"" I have heard many others on radio. This one is the best.I have been married to the same woman for 43 years. This version of ""Love Without End Amen"" is our favorite love song. I have been at one live performance with this group and they put on a great show. This record has a great balance of classic bluegrass and numbers special to this group. They get together too rarely, but their blended sound is wonderful."
3,not the greatest,have been using my ATG gun for a long time- this tape takes a lot of work to use. adhesive sticks to the roll instead of the paper and gums up the whole works. Not worth the hassle just to save a little $.
5,So inexpensive,This is a really good adhesive tape for my small at home framing business . It is just as good as the 3M Gold at a fraction of the price! A definite must buy for any framer of scrap booker.
5,Nice,"i bought this because I was looking for an inexpensive way to at least start gathering pilates equipment. I also practice yoga, and I needed a new mat and strap. I decided on this set due to the lower cost of it and was surprised at how nice it is. Mine is also blue (like the previous reviewer), but I prefer the blue to the purple in the picture. The ball feels pretty sturdy which really surprised me, and the mat is nice and non-slip so you don't feel like you are going to slide off. I haven't had as much time to play around with it as I would like, but I would recommend this set to someone just wanting to start out, and not spend a TON of money on supplies."
4,Great instructional video,"This is an excellent choice for beginner or novice skateboarders, and even intermediate skaters can pick up a few tips to make their basics cleaner and more reliable.Dan breaks down each trick in a clear, consistent, and precise manner. I wouldn't start my kid off with any other instructional video.It's not mind-blowing, however: This is a no-frills instructional video that comes off a bit humorless and dry, and it's hard to keep people's attention without a personal touch. Also, the narration for parts of many tricks becomes redundant, and I found myself wishing Dan had started with names for different foot set up positions, e.g. ""the ollie position"", or ""the shove-it position"", or even ""the flame dragon position""--because there aren't already common names for the foot positions, the field is ripe!"
4,video,i got this for my son formChristmas. Hes 8 and has been skating for 2 years and is happy with the video.
2,Skateboarding NOT explained,"Ok, let's start with the title: ""Skateboarding Explained""... One would think that this video explains techniques and tricks. Well it doesn't. This video is like washing machine instructions, it goes like ""step 1: do this, step 2: do this"" and never goes any deeper. I'm giving it 2 stars for the first part of the video, where it demonstrates the very basics where not much can go wrong and teaches a good approach to skateboarding for total beginners. If you're anything more than that, this video will not help you. when it goes into more advanced tricks it explaines NOTHING and will not help you land them, it's like a camera's ""quick start"" instruction manual, it very briefly describes each step of the trick without analyzing common mistakes and how to correct them. If it's your first time on a skateboard, get this video, but if you're looking for help to land anything more advanced than an ollie, then stay away from it. There are FAR better FREE videos on youtube."
5,"Best ""How To"" video in skateboarding","Dan has hit the nail on the head with this video. He has so much experience teaching people how to skate from working with Lake Owen that he was able to tranfer his knowledge to video very easily. His step by step instruction is incredibly easy to follow. If you can't learn tricks from this video, maybe you are in the wrong sport, as he breaks it down so clearly, anyone can do it. I know so many people who are anxiously awaiting skateboarding explained 2, to learn even more. If you are a beginner or intermdiate skater, this video will take you to the next level."
5,skateboarding explained by dan Macfarlane,"This was a great video. I purchased it for my son who is 13 years old. He has been skating for a quite a few years, but the video is also for beginners. My son really liked it and he learned a lot from it. I will be waiting for a part 2, hopefully for his birthday."
5,A logical and progressive way to learn to skate. The best!,"I've repeatedly heard about this video from everyone and finally decided to give it a try. This is the best skateboarding investment I've purchased since my skateboard itself! It made me wonder how people begin without it. Skateboarding Explained is that good! I was skating for 3 years before this and have been kicking myself for not getting this sooner and pondering how good I would be now if I had. This video takes you from starting out, to basics, and then the most sought out tricks beginners and intermediate skaters will want to learn. I watched it over and over the first night I received it and the next day when I went skating I was thinking very differently and skating much better immediately. After reviewing it over a week my skills drastically improved. Any age skater can majorly benefit from owning and studying this video. I have to give major kudos to Dan MacFarlane for making this!"
5,Simply amazing,"How did I get here in the first place?I was on myspace and I saw that a video on how to do the tre flip(360 kickflip) was on the featured videos.I went to check it out.I was amazed at his instructions.Later on I added him and he had an event where he gave out many S.E. dvds to skaters.I was lucky to be one of those.I then looked at it and was amazed at how much I improved!He gives out clear steps on how it's done.I had improved so much and astonished my friends.They were curious on how I learned how to do a trick quicker then them because it was taking them weeks.Overall, if your a skater of any level, this is a must get in order to achieve your highest level.This is incomparable to other videos that arent as good.Thank you Dan!"
5,Skateboarding Explained is the best instructional dvd!,"Skateboarding explained has helped my skating in many ways. Even if i knew a trick, watching the trick tip still helped me to progress the trick and learn it better then i had it before. I've watched the movie several times and each time ive learned something new. Any new or experienced skateboarding can learn from this dvd. I feel it gives you more information then any other dvd out there and helps you to progress faster! I won a copy of this dvd and i couldnt be more thankful! Its been a big help and i recommend it to any skateboarder!"
4,Cute Critters,"The hooks are cute and matches with our sea life theme. The only reason why this product did not get a 5 star is because the critters are not completely secured on the hooks. They will fall out after a few uses. Luckily, I have my hot glue gun! Works like a charm now."
1,"Swim, Baby Swim","This video is only good for fastforwarding through. There is about 3 minutes of good, solid information and the rest is fluff. Please do not waste your money or time on this video."
4,Cute,These are very cute. I'm glad I bought them. It is boring if you only have one though. But the fun of these is the fun of barbie dolls. Making up scenes & stuff to have your super cute animals act out. The perfect size pet to go along with any barbie doll. It looks like the My Scene pets. I also have the Portable Poodle In Blue Carrying Case. She is very cute also. It is so hard to pick which one to buy. They are all so cute!
5,Excellent Product Great Price!,These are particularly great for people who wear glasses that don't want to spend a lot of money on prescription sunglasses. They fix over your regular eyewear comfortably and come in a variety of styles and colors. I LIKE them.
1,A book that is only for some people,"If you are good at figuring things out and enjoy exploring all the mechanisms of Maya 5 by yourself but dont know where to start then this book is for you.On the otherhand, if you just a firm hand to guide you as you learn the basics of Maya then this book is not for you as the instructions is aimed towards people who are able to figure somethings out by themselves. But this book covers alot and as I said some people will learn alot from this book and others will end up hating it."
3,This book could be better!,"This book I thought was alright. Nothing to give high praises over. I think I would have enjoyed the DVD more if the individual speaking was the actual author. I enjoy listening to videos where the instructor is speaking candid, not reading word for word from a sheet of instructions. Very monotone and boring."
2,Extremely frustrating book!,"It is a tutorial book. In order to get answers to your questions, you need to comb through a step-by-step description of how to build a lobby or create a coat; and you never know why you are asked to do thing in one way and not the other. If you need information, explanation or basic understanding of how and why Maya works - do not buy this book."
2,Don't waste your money.,"So, I was required to buy this book for my 3D modeling class at RIT, and I hope you learn from my forced misery. This book lures you in with neat tutorials for the first few chapters, but even then, you're given all the information necessary and don't learn WHY you're doing anything. Chapter 5 is downright terrible. The tutorials are actually WRONG, and the narrator of the demo video says something along the lines of ""uh, the book is really unclear here, so we'll just hope this is right."" It's kind of funny provided you aren't trying to finish a project on time.The best part of this book is some cool art that's been done by MAYA artists, in full color in glossy pages in the middle. Go to a bookstore, pick this up, look through those, then set the book back down and start looking elsewhere for tutorials and help."
1,Entertainment Fluff Only,"Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this. They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content. ""I love birthday parties, yeah"" - ""They're here, let the party begin"" - ""oink oink"". This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often. Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it. There is little actual phonics training. The phonics ""games"" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff. These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good. The Leappads are worthless."
4,Not Samba + Electronica...Better,"More than just the fusion of Brazilian and club beats, batucada electronica is in fact its own style and scene. As noted in previous reviews, drum 'n' bass is prevalent as a source, as is breakbeat in the broader sense. Beyond that however, the Brazilian-ness of the music goes beyond carnival to include more experimental inspirations like Hermeto Pascoal. The result is a truly Brazilian form of electronic dance music, and listening to this disc offers the mix of excitement and mental challenge that one gets seeing a form of music emerge from the underground. ""Caipirissima"" is not a party disc: It is challenging and rewarding (and still decidedly groove-ful) look at how Brazilian artists have adapted electronic music to their own ends."
4,Happy Mommy.,This was a Christmas gift for my 6 and 8 yr old sons and they are enjoying it. They have been reading anf playing the games. Very satisfied.
3,o.k. book,"This book is good for those who want to hear stories about body building from the 60's era. It does give stories of The Oak, but I wish it covered more of the 70's era, like Pumping Iron."
4,Interpretations at their best,"Quite frankly, I was a bit disappointed when I first popped this CD into the CD player and found it to be interpretations of these songs by other artists, not by the original artists. As soon as I found this out, I felt like turning it off imeediately. But then I started listening to the music and found it hard to take it off. They sounded as good, if not better, than the original recordings. After almost resorting to throw this one in the trash, I now play it once or twice everyday, especially those first two songs. If you're of the type that doesn't mind if the songs are not sung by the original artists, and is looking for some great reggae music, then buy this one now."
4,Memory Lane,"Watching this DVD was an inspirational walk down memory lane. Many childhood memories came floodng back as I viewed the DVD.The only drawback was the repetition of some of the same songs as one show followed another, perhaps in too close proximity in chronological time."
5,to the moon,"I have always been interested in astronomy, but always a novice. From my early experiences at the smithsonian museum of air and space to a few electives in college. This book is great, the pictures are captivating, and the material is great. This is a great gift or a fantastic buy for the home enthusiast."
2,Maximum Trivium,"It wasn't what I was expecting... I was hoping for music but I basically got an oral biography, it was cool to hear about what happened in the band though but it wasn't what I hoped for..."
1,Not befitting a DIVA!!!!,I was so excited when I heard about this box set. Until I saw what it actually is. As a true Cher fan I have been waiting for years for 'Come Back To The Five and Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean' to finally be released on DVD. This collectiob has their early movies but still is missing this vital one. These have all been available on DVD for years. So disappointed they haven't released one of her best films. If it had been included I would have bought the whole set just for that one movie.
2,meh...,"While I am a big fan of Cher on all fronts, this film collection is somewhat disappointing. It does offer some of her best performances such as ""Moonstruck"" and ""Tea With Mussolini."" but it appears like ""Good Times"" was added to pad the collection. It's too bad that ""Mask"" was not a part of this set as it was one of her best films. I would skip it and buy them separately."
2,Not for everyone,I love Cher but this collection is disappointing except for Silkwood and Tea With Mussolini. I never seen Chasity and Good Times and don't want to see either again.
5,"powerful, sultry and an awesome pianist",Ms. Simone Greatest Hits she sings from Life's Experience and the Soul! Wishing I had seen her in Concert. My Favorite cut is: Feeling Good hands down! EXCELLENT!
3,Nina,I like this album but I actually bought it for the title song. I would have preferred another of her albums but it was unavailable at the time
3,"Great Translation, Great footnotes, needs tabs, etc.","A Moslem recommended Pickthall's translation to me. It has really helpful notes, and since the translator is a devout Moslem, I could rely on the translation as representing what a Moslem would consider it to mean (generally, it's considered bad to translate the Koran, due to any corruption problems between languages, for much the same reason as it is for the Bible).But it's hard to find stuff, and I'd have liked more annotations on keywords and phrases like ""Lord of the Worlds"", and ""if ye did but know"". Then again, I don't think this book was meant to be anything but the plain text, with as little annotation as possible. For that, it's great."
3,CIPA Towing Mirrors,"For those looking for a good - replacement mirror - CIPA should be considered. I have a 2006 Silverado used to tow a 5th wheeler. The CIPA mirrors looked to be a great answer with their slide out capability. Overall the quality is good. I was surprised to find included in the package a set of spot convex mirrors - one was smahed into multiple pieces... I found quickly why they are included... the right side mirror is flat - no curve to hlep with a wider view like the stock unit (""thing look closer....""). I nearly creamed a small car as I changed lanes. I added the small mirror - I c an now see the spot - but it would have been much better to have a full size mirror - I now have to look at both the small unit and the larger mirror before moving over.The units mount easily - one you pull the door panel off. 1 hr for the first one and 10 min for the second one. Overall good product but not a flat out winner."
3,Cipa mirrors,"Mirrors, shipped and arrived promptly . 1 mirror glass fell off of housing during shipment . I re- installed glass,and will be keeping old mirrors so I have something to put back on when glass falls off again. I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
2,"Ok story, but thin characters who are mainly sterotypes","The characters in this novel could have been taken right our of the D&D; players handbook. They seemed hollow and I didn't connect with any of them.If you are a die hard fan of Eberron or D&D; you might make it through this one, otherwise there are better titles set in Eberron."
5,Wow! Finally Got to Read It,"I had purchased this sequel to Ratha's Creature a few years ago and never had the chance to read it. I found it recently and peeked at the beginning and before I knew it, I had finished the entire book. It was thrilling from beginning to end with interesting characters, both new and familiar. I love the new evolution of the Named and their involvement with the little lemur-type creatures. It was really easy to enjoy and a great sequel to a good book and a great start to a series.Certainly if you like anything Clare Bell writes, especially Ratha's Creature, this is worth picking up. Also, it's worth picking up all the other books in the series...which is something I still have to do. I can't wait until the graphic novels become available. I'd love to collect those too."
2,very disappointing,"I have read most of Gillian White's books (some were only obtainable second-hand) and loved them. However, I found this book dull, predictable and very repetitative in parts.Even the so-called ""surprise ending"" was not much of a surprise. A great shame as I was really excited when this book was reprinted and bought it immediately. I can thoroughly recommend some of her other titles, ""Grandfather's footsteps"", ""Mothertime"", ""Beggar Bride."""
4,Biblical Pronunciations,Very Good. Concise and to the point. Provides an excellent reference for those involved in reading the Word of God for the praying community or simply interested in exactly how those difficult words really sound.
5,Funny and Informative,Very entertaining read. I had not ever heard of him before I came across his book. I am now looking to buy his previous book.
1,Condescending and inaccurate,Steingarten's writing comes off as very arrogant and condescending. He does minimal research which he often interprets incorrectly. I could barely get through the introduction.
3,"Morbid Angel is great,but a little goes a long way","I love Morbid Angel, and this album is great, but after a while you realize they've done a lot of this before. It's still pretty good though, but they could've done better."
2,Death Metal the way it shouldn't be,Morbid Angel who have been praised as forfathers of the death metal genre return with a new vocalist and the same old tired riffs.Much of this material is a blatent rip off of their previous album (Dominate.)The songs are heavy and aggressive but they sound to familiar.Morbid Angel have lost thier wings and they are decending to obscurity at an alarming rate.Pick up any of their other albums if you want to hear classic Angel.The band should be embarressed to say the least.Well they did mimic Domination perfectly so let's give em a little credit.
1,"Like Emperor, Morbid Angel is going in the wrong direction!","if people say that this cd is Morbid Angel's best work, then you need your head examined! Taking this album over albums like Covenant, Altars of Madness and Blessed are the Sick is udder stupidity. Boring riffs, poorly put together songs make for a pretty bad album."
4,"Trey is Awesome, but only half of Formulas is worth a 10","Most of this album is kept alive by Commando's drumming. The new vocalist rips a new one in death metal, he truly fits this band. Trey's lead sound is swallowed up by the rythm guitars though. ""Heaving Earth"" and ""Nothing is Not"" are Morbid Angel at their best but the rest of the album is overshadowed by ""Rapture"", ""God of Emptiness"", "" ""Immortal Rites"", ""Rebel Lands"", etc. They work best as a three-piece. Still, great job Trey."
3,NOT THEIR BEST WORK.,"Over all, I think this is a okay album but it does not compare to their previous albums.The guitar work on this album sounds weird and I just cant get into it.The new singer does not measure up to davids vocals.I love this band and appreciate that they are still tearing it up in the scene,but I just cant enjoy this particular cd.Some people may like this cd and thats fine by me because everyones different.MORBID ANGEL RULES!!!"
2,Formulas Fatal to Morbid Angel,"Formulas, is the third Morbid Angel album that I have purchased, but is definately the worst. It just does not capture my interest, and the songs tend to be monotonous with annoying riffs. The riffing is very loose, muddy, and noisy, unlike Slayer or Cannibal Corpse. I love the fact that they dedicate whole albums to Lovecraftian imagery, but the lyrical delivery is pretty shallow ie. ""We summon thee, blah blah, he of highest power, blah blah, from the depths I envoke thee, blah, blah."" Lyrics are not their strong suit.Skip this one and get Covenant, Gateways, or Blessed are the Sick."
3,"Marduk, Great magician of the Gods!","What a way to start the day! This album delivers great lyrics, without David Vincent! , but with Trey Azagthoth, his guitar work not as possessed, but always creative, and Pate Sandoval who's probably one of the fastest, tightest drummers still around, for that matter this album deserves some attention, but after you listen to it, if you go back to ""Altars of Madness"" and/or ""Blessed are the Sick"" you will realise that unfortunately somethings missing, but then again listen to it more than once, to recapture the magic of the ancient ones, so open the gate that you may enter....... The true realms of Necromantic art."
3,Sorry Slagheap,"I used to love Morbid Angel, they're the band that got me into death metal with their release ""Blessed Are The Sick"". I'm sorry but compared to every album previously released by MA, this one is the worst. The production is lacking but what really kills this album for me is that it has some of the goofiest, unintentionally ridiculous lyrics ever: Zuu zuu ug sub nig crakhore, indeed. Supposedly that crap is ancient Summerian, hmmmn, uh yeah. Somebody's read the paperback Necronomicon a few too many times. I gave it three stars because some of the music is exceptionally good, but I really miss their original singer and bass player Dave Vincent. That guy could write some lyrics and I miss his voice. Get any of their previous records in lieu of this one, especially Covenant, Blessed Are The Sick or Altars of Madness."
5,Morbid Angel returns with a vengeance!,"After the split of vocalist David Vincent, Morbid Angel returns with their most crushing album since ""Altars of Madness."" If you are a fan of early M.A, then this should please you very much, on the other hand if you are a fan of ""Domination"" you may not appreciate this album. Every song on this album is amazingly fast and tight! Guitar wise it is unmistakenly Morbid Angel. New vocalist Steve Tucker brings a new dimension to the band in a very good way. You can hear the raw crushing sound in his vocals that David had lost in the last album. I think by the time the next album comes out Steve will have come into his own as a vocalist. He is much different from David Vincent, yet has a unique quality in his vocals like David did. I can't wait to hear what the new album will sound like! I definitely think this is one of Morbid Angel's best!"
5,Brilliant!,But what do you expect coming from one of the most intelligent comedians in the business. Hilarious & flawless...
2,"too much of the ""F"" word","I consider myself a good democrat and was not aware of this video until I had the opportunity to see Mr Maher's video about religion. I ordered it and had difficulty watching it mainly because of the ""f"" word being inserted too often ."
1,Please enter a title for your review,although i like bill maher's talk show i've always found his opening monologues painfully amateurish and unfunny so i don't know what possessed me to check out this one hour stand-up set but it's firmly set him in my mind as the worst stand-up comedian i've ever endured. his Bush bashing and otherwise cliched sentiments have never been less cleverly expressed.
1,Suckered into buying this book by the bogus reviews,"This book was a major disapointment, after reading the hyped up reviews. I have learned one thing about the Amazon reviews, that: if the reviewer only has one review when you check their other reviews, Most likely they are friends or the author writing positive reviews on the book. Most of these reviews are hype by the author to sell his book. This book is a lot of airy-fairy new age type philosopy and very little to do with martial arts or Ninja. A lot of references to carlos castanada. Reads like a new age book. I couldnt even finish it. A waste of time/money."
2,Ehh.......,lets just say i've spent my money better learning about ninja stuff from t.v.self improvement and what not is good but i want to learn more about mind manipulation and how to really mess with peoples heads. but i mean if ur all meditative and stuff than go ahead get this book
2,disappointing,"This is a book I wanted to read very much, I first saw it in the Inner Traditions catalogue. It was a holiday gift and I couldn't wait to start reading it. I began with high hopes but quickly realized it was just Mr. Heaven's ideas, using ninpo as his springboard. It is not really about ninpo. One good thing about a book like this is that it makes one search more for the true information. Shoninki The Secret Teachings of the Ninja is definitely the better book, by Master Natori Masazumi."
3,Good spiritual exercises,"If you have never meditated or focused on your breath, then I suggest getting versed in Zen before you read this book. The book leads you by the hand in meditative exercises just like any other mindfulness/imagery instructional book should. If you take these exercises seriously, a lot of unconscious mechanisms will surface which may be hard to deal with. The exercises force you to confront a lot of things, but mainly fear."
2,a question,"Does anyone know if this guy is Bujinkan, or is affiliated with Hatsumi or the Bujinkan, or any XKAN? Or is he some Ashida Kim type who just uses the ""ninja"" word to sell books?"
2,Eh...,"Okay if you don't hit it hard, or have it on something other than a perfectly flat surface, or have any winds over 3 mph, or .... on a positive note, if you are chipping very lightly, from close up, with a whiffle ball, this is perfect."
4,This book is very neat and educational!,"I bought this book for two main reasons: My little neighbor across the street has a LeapPad, too, and sometimes I go over there and help him read with his books, and number two, I forgot which sounds the long/short vowels make! Now I know. I haven't let my neighbor try it out yet, but I'm sure he'd like it. I took it to a party and the kids there played with this book and thought it was neat. The games are actually enjoyable and, sometimes, even a bit challenging for me! I'm sure younger kids love them. There really shouldn't be an age limit on this! I think that whether you have a child who needs to learn how to read or just needs some reinforcement or practice, you should buy this book and consider the other books in this series. Lesson Books 6, 7, and 8 correspond with this activity book. Good Luck!"
4,techniques & tips,this book may give some better methodologies to follow cad/cam techniques in the stream of cad/ cam area
3,this item should be taken off your website......,"I did the research and found that this item will not fit on any hoe of any kind...TAKE it off your website....re:210-19 36"" curved grub hoe handle..."
5,not boring math,"In addition to being an engaging story with adventure, humor, and surprises, Cohen ""teaches"" the math encountered in an interesting way. All in all, the book is a great read that keeps the reader turning the pages till they end."
2,great subject but very formulaic,"i had great expectations for this book, as i had a sort of fascination with fractals in college and dearly love a well written whodunnit story...but i was severly dissapointed. what goes on in the book is interesting enough, but the writing seemed terrible to me. we find out tens of times thru out the book what people are wearing and eating, and about the hero's workouts, but things don't add up to a cohesive whole...lots of stereotypes as well...pepper keane is just a collection of interesting traits, doesn't come across as a real person. and as a former math major, let me tell you, female math professors are about as plentiful as honest politicians - but this is a nitpick really."
4,Smart,"""The Fractal Murders"" offers a terrific premise and the delivery lives up to it, too. The sleuthing is dogged, hard work. It's smart and well organized--the kind of diligent, relentless focus that is probably the norm out there for actual detectives. The Colorado settings are well rendered. I thought a few key things happened a bit too conveniently: the jet ride to Boston, the handy night vision goggles, access via a friend to key commercial airline passenger manifests. I also could have done without all the restaurant and eating descriptions; they just don't add up to much. For a guy who spends a lot of time running and working out, there is very little physical action. Most of the work is mental. Readers looking for a good brain exercise will enjoy how Pepper Keane approaches his work and the end packs a nifty double twist."
2,"Too much Bill, not enough Bruce...","I got this movie for two reasons: 1. It's being sold in Russia on the black market as ""The Matrix 2."" 2. It has Bruce Campbell in it. Unfortunately, Bruce isn't in the movie for long, as he is killed off early in the picture. The rest of the film is pretty bad, being your typical DTV picture, but there are some good qualities to it. Michael Dorn is good as Menno's best friend, and there is some good humor. But most of the movie is very silly with terrible acting and pretty subpar action. I guess if you like ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" you'll like this one."
2,MENNO'S MINDLESS,"This is another one of those future societies where man's quest for self satisfaction is the major motivator of daily living. Too bad director Jon Kroll didn't enliven it with some good acting or great action scenes. As it is, we get Bruce Campbell for a few minutes as an underground rebel leader who when fatally shot downloads his brain into a computer. Nerdy computer geek Bill Campbell is then forced by the tough Stephanie Romanov to download Bruce's brain into his own so he can find out what it is that Brucie knew about an impending computer disaster. Corbin Bernsen (gleefully vile as usual) is an evil guy who is running for President and has decided to use the Resort to influence votes.The acting is negligible to say the least and the pace is snail-like at best.Could have been better, but no cigar this time!"
2,disapointing,"I got this video and was excited by the possible plot, and bruce cambell is usually good. To cut to the chase this is dissapointing. It has a relative good idea, but the script is one-dimensional at best. The acting it sub par, the director never even gave bruce a chance to be bruce. Not to say this was a horrible film, it was ok, for a late night showtime film, or something. I wouldn't recommend it unless it's on television, or a movie channel, and there's nothing else on."
5,AMAZING!!!,"This game is definetly worth the price you pay and makes Sim City a whole lot better! I especially like plopping Area 5.1 to get the UFO and decimate my city! (Ok here is a way to get an easy $10000... Ok build and iscolated build with a short peice of road connected to a fire station. Next use the fire disaster on the iscolated building and use the u drive it mode and select the fire truck. You should get the mission ""Fire!"". Accept it and because the fire station is right next door you put out the blaze in like two seconds. I made a FORTUNE doing this! So just BUY IT!"
2,Disappointing,"Because I have other George Foreman products that are very good, I was very disappointed in this one. The racks are made of wire that is not strong enough to hold a pyrex 6 inch by 8 inch glass dish filled with a pasta and vegetable mixture! The racks fell out of their slots!What ever happened to quality! I don't even want to think what might happen if I tried using the spit to roast a chicken!"
3,Much bigger than I thought,"I was surprised at how large this toaster oven / broiler was. Befire ordering it, make sure you are willing to give over enough space for it. We decided not to and returned the item."
1,Difficult To Assemble,"I am very good with electronics and new fangled gadgets. This product has NO SETUP instructions. It does list parts and part numbers however no assembly guide. Too many parts to tell what goes where. While it may be a great product after setup...taking mine back. A toaster oven should be ""out of the box"" ready!"
2,"Jack of all trades, master of none","We purchased the George Foreman 8 in 1 with the thought we would get the toaster oven we needed and some other features that would be nice to have. The 8 in 1 does have alot of neat features, the issue is it doesn't do any of the features very well. The toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller, more conventional toaster oven. The Rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate. We found out the hard way when we had chicken grease overflow out of the grill and onto the counter. I can see this being a very good item for those with very small kitchens and in need of saving space, however, be warned that this oven has many shortcomings."
2,NOT all that,"The heat that escapes the flimsy door and ""griddle top"" makes for inacurate temperatures during cooking. I have to use an oven thermometer and make sure the oven is pulled far away from any walls/cabinets. I suggest you keep a close eye during use as it gets very hot on the outside. I agree with the other review ""you get what you pay for"""
3,GRV660 8-in-1,"Performs well. However, generates too much external heat. In order to maintain the desired heat,you must set the temperature above the desired level which takes some practice."
3,Burner failure,After five months of service without a problem the top burner (broiler unit) failed. My efforts to get help from the company have failed although they did respond to my e-mail atating I would receive a response in 8 working days. No response ten days later. I see the oven is out of stock and may not be conntinued.
2,Disappointed,"After reading the rave reviews, I ordered one to be delivered the next day. It arrived damaged so back it went and I immediately ordered a replacement.It arrived undamaged but when I turned it on for a 15 minute try out, as suggested, it produced so much heat that I'm afraid we'll get burned. The back of the oven next to the wall was dangerously hot. Also, the door does not close--you can see into the oven at the bottom right when the door is closed--major source of heat loss. This would be okay for toasting but for roasting or baking, the kitchen would get unbelievably hot"
4,Nice... performs a lot of tasks.... well,"Nice item... has stood up well....Only issue is that set-up, which is a bit involved, is not very clear in the instructions... Once I got it up and working, it's served all purposes well. Unit does throw out some heat... watch where you put it!"
2,Bad Door,most ovens open top to bottom.. not here it has a spring on it and opens to the right which if your not fast will burn you. not as good as advertised
2,Cheap and flimsey,"Do not waste your money on this oven. It is cheap looking and does not work well. The toaster is the worst. The burners are too far apart from each other to work properly. It takes 10 minutes to make the toast. It toasts unevenly and the bread turns out baked and hard. I thought I was buying a black appliance but the only thing black is the face. The sides and top are a cheap metal color. The bun warmer on top is a joke. It is not deep enough to put anything other than a flat biscuit. I purchased this at what I thought was a good sale price, but the expression ""you get what you pay for"" is an understatement."
3,GOOD,"I RATE IT GOOD BECAUSE THE ROTISSERIE AND BROILER WORKS VERY WELL. THE PROBLEM IS THE PAN THAT CATCHES THE GREASE IS TOO FLAT. THEREFORE, THE GREASE GOES DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND OUT THE BACK OF THE OVEN, WHICH THEN LEAKS TO THE OUTSIDE. IF YOU DON'T KEEP AN EYE ON IT, YOU'LL HAVE A BIG MESSY, GREASY SPILL TO CLEAN UP. SO YOU CONSTANTLY HAVE TO CHECK THE PAN AND EMPTY IT. THIS ALSO LEADS TO A MESS, BECAUSE THE PAN IS FLAT."
1,Poor quality!,"This machine is poor quality and poorly designed. I have it less than three months and the turning agent is much slower than when new and has trouble turning a large bird. In addition, the screw for the part holding the bird to the spit has broken. Do not buy!"
1,VERY DISATFIED WITH THIS ITEM,"I bought this item Dec.2004. It was used only for making toast, and on April 10th, 2006 the upper heating elemte stopped working so I got intouch with the George Foreman 8 in 1 Toaster Oven/Brolier Model No.GRV660???? But they said I could not buy this part. VERY, VERYTHANK * GOD BLESS,Wanda"
3,"George Foreman GRV660 8-in-1 toaster oven/broiler/rotisserie,black","I just received this toaster oven. It arrived with a dent on the top of the machine, and one of the bake racks is broken. I know this didn't happen during shipping because both the toaster oven box and the shipping box are not damaged at all. I don't understand why the manufacturer would ship something dented &/or broken. I only gave it 3 stars because the other reviewers who received undamaged ones state that it toasts, broils, etc., well."
1,check the door carefully,"I returned this product without even using it.The first thing I noticed was that there is a hole in the top which is almost as large as the top! The idea is that the bun warmer is set into the hole to keep fresh bread warm. However, while baking or otherwise using the oven, heat will escape from around the edges of the bun warmer.Secondly, the edges of the front door don't meet the frame of the oven. I could almost put the tip of my little finger into one of the spaces. Another place where heat will escape.Since my reason for buying a toaster oven was to save energy, the two above deficiencies were enough for me to return the toaster oven without even plugging it in!George, you can do better than this!"
5,George Foreman Toaster Oven,"The best! Five stars plus! This little thing does everything my big oven does and does it better, with practically no heat escaping into the kitchen. I have baked, broiled, roasted,toasted, grilled and rotisseried and everything comes out perfect.What can I say, I just love it, and I use it every day.Thank you, George Foreman for whatever youhad to do with this."
3,Nice interim item,"Good item if you do not have an oven. Works well as toaster oven or small baking dishes. Most pizzas fit as well. Great for Bruchetta.Negative: Front door get very hot and does not close all the way. Because of that gap between door and rest of the unit, the food in the back of the unit gets done first and you have to rotate the dish to be cooked evenly. or you turn the heat higher, and the back will burn slightly. Whatever you prefer."
2,THE QUALITY OF THIS THING IS GARBAGE,"With a nod to the positive reviews, yes, while it works it works well. But the quality is 100% pure garbage. Within a few months all the markings on the dials rubbed off; ok, I could live with that. But just after the warranty period expired, the rotisserie mechanism broke -- when even a small amount of weight is placed on the spit it tries to turn but slips back, which tells me (I have some experience in fixing mechanical gadgets) that the gears in the motor mechanism have broken teeth. This of necessity means that the material the gears were made of is extremely low quality, since ordinarily gears (that are not being shifted, as in a car transmission) DO NOT get teeth broken off. For $80 I'm not going to pay to have it fixed, I will use it a bit longer, but be warned: the parts are made out of junk materials and it will break, probably sooner than later."
4,Great for beginners but...,"even though it is a wonderful resource for helping to teach genealogy it is not for the Non-American.This is a book that lists page after page of addresses for each state of places to write to which is great for anyone researching in the States but really doesn't help those of us who have no American ancestors.I did , however, find the medical pedigree section extremely interesting."
4,"Great scale, a few drawbacks",Scale seems very accurate but body fat is hard to assess: better make sure your state of hydration is always the same as small fluctuations can create spurious changes in body fat. Also stores info for only two people. Have to bend over and hit controls to turn the scale on- a minor inconvenience if you are not orthopedically challenged. Attractive scale with see-through glass.
4,Just what I needed.,This little one page per day is just what I needed for a short read just before sleep. It calms my spirit and gives me something positive to think about as I go to sleep.
5,Great Book,"As a graduate I encountered a book called ""counter examples in analysis"" which I found very useful. I always dreamed of such a book in topology, this book exceeds my dreams. It is great. It does not cover all the examples that I have used over the decades but it does cover some that I have never seen. The style is quite readable for a professional topologist. The book goes into a lot of interesting details (and some while not interesting to me would be another person). In short for me it is an essential book. The question is to whom else would this be interesting to. It is clearly of little use to a first year student and less to more advanced student. It's brand of topology is not the current cutting edge. So the audience for this book is limited to a small group and for these people it is top notch."
4,A Really Cheap yet Great Resource for Topology,"I really like the compactness of this book; that is, this book is the finite subcover for any arbitrary cover on the subject of Topology. Seriously, It gives almost all the major definitions which you would ever need, and it provides all kinds of nontrivial examples. Depending on your preference, the notation can sometimes be a little awkward, but it is neither incorrect nor ambiguous; that is, it is still correct and clear, depending on your understanding. Any mathematician ought to have this book in his collection for reference."
4,A book on Topolgy with a map,"This book gave me an inspiration: it isn't the best written or the best organized, just one of the best topology books I've ever found! It gives you an idea of the areas of topology in a way that is very good and very understandable."
1,Counterexamples in Topology,I have found this book to be confusing to use and therefore of little to no value. If I had seen in a bookstore and not Online I would not have purchased it. I also purchased Schaum's Outline of General Topology which is very good.
5,New York Characters,"If you are a New Yorker, a former New Yorker, or someone new to the City, you should own this book. The photography is both penetrating and compelling, and the characters featured are truly fascinating. It's like the Zagat of New York people. I hope the author comes to Los Angeles to do a book on characters here (there are plenty)!"
5,The definitive book for renewing ones hope after loss.,"Someone has been following me around and then wrote about my suffering in this book! There was a prayer for every stage of my journey though grief. What an inspiration and comfort this book has been. I'm stocking up so that I can share this with others that will need to take the long, dark journey though loss and grief."
5,want this book,I read a few pages of this book a few years ago Want a copy but so expensive why is that
2,Not bad,"I bought a couple pairs of these - for the price, they aren't as good as the typical pair you'd find in a gas station for $5. Shipping was quick.These are silver mirrored, not smoke black mirrored like the picture with the two pairs shows, just be aware."
3,NOT BIG.........,"I BOUGHT 3 PAIRS BASED ON AMAZON REVIEWS, AND DON'T NECESSARILY REGRET THE DECISION BECAUSE THEY WERE SO CHEAP....THESE ARE OK SUNGLASSES.........NOT GREAT, BUT OK........AND, THEY ARE NOT ""BIG SUNGLASSES"", BUT THE TYPICAL SMALL-TEARDROPS FOUND IN DRUGSTORES.....VERY LIGHTWEIGHT CONSTRUCTION, AND ONE PAIR WAS BENT, BUT FIXABLE.......I DON'T THINK THEY'LL HOLD UP LONG, BUT THE PRICE WAS RIGHT, AND I CAN THROW THEM AWAY AS THEY BREAK....I WILL SAY THAT THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST....YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.........JUST DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH......"
5,Sam was one of the best,This video gives a lot of history about Sam. After Sam's death there were a buch of rumors about how he died and this video explains a lot.
3,Printed in green color,"It is a bit frustrating to open a book of costume and see that all the page of book are printed in a pale green.ink...The design is there but impossible to know what were the reel color of the dresses...I bought 3 of those books...one in green, one in red and the other in blue...It is ok for students.."
3,"Tommy ""Light""","Returning to the Blind Pig label fans like me hoped Tommy would be able to recapture his past glory. As always the guitar playing is crisp and concise. The voice soulful with a hint of Seger. However this is perhaps his weakest batch of songs in his illustrious career. Please see this band LIVE.... And lets hope Tommy and his collaborators can come up with better than rote ""soul blues"". Not terrrible mind you, check out his earlier disks on the coolest blues label of all."
3,Close ... It's A Toss Up,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge, huge Tommy Castro fan. I own everything he has produced, and while Soul Shaker has glimpses of what we all love about TC -- his gritty, soulful voice and Top-10 guitar playing, this CD falls a little short. Perhaps it's the departure from what he has previously provided us, but aside from a few tunes aforementioned in previous reviews, Soul Shaker comes across as a little less that upbeat, more studio. I understand from hearing TC on interviews, that Soul Shaker was to be a departure from previous works. In this regard, it works. I wouldn't say not to purchase this effort because my hunch is it may grow on you over time. Listen to a few tracks at your local CD store and make your own call ... it's really a toss up. In any event, TC is a winner in the blues music scene. His body of work up to this point speaks volumes about his talent, and I for one, look forward to all of his offerings for years to come."
2,My least favorite TCB CD,"I have enjoyed seeing the Tommy Castro Band dozens of times in the last few years, and have many of their CDs. This one is sub-par . . ."
1,Should be Soul-less and Shake-less,"This CD reminds me of the Robert Cray CD ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" where a good blues singer does an mediocre soul CD. But in this case a great blues guitarist and singer does an awful sell-out CD that mixes light rock with psuedo soul and strips out the searing electric blues guitar and roaring, crisp vocals that got them there.It is great if you are on top of the world and can put out any music you like, but it is hard to believe anyone would like this watered down tripe...save your money for when Tommy comes to his senses and puts out a decent Blues CD, which he hasn't done since Gratitude, and that was not as good as his previous works...The flute song is the only redeeming song on here, and while interesting it is not enough to make you want this CD.Keith S. :{)>"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Second world shanghai.A woman from our world in the eighties (which was the current time then) finds herself in a fantasy world, and hence with more than one problem, least of which is attempting to get back where she came from.Her hope is one clever, good wizard. Of course, there is the possibily of an evil wizard in opposition back from the grave, too.Decent enough example of the modern woman/man to a world of magic example. Nothing more than that."
3,Frozen Shot Glasses,"This idea is great, however in order for the product to work with alcohol and not leak you have to use distilled water so there are no bubbles, because once the liquor hits the bubbles you spring a leak..overall i love this and pretty much anything that 'Fred' makes"
4,Really Neat Idea!,"These are a novel idea. They work well, but the only issue is they do not freeze totally flat on the bottom. This can be lessened with bottled water as this is mainly due to ions in the water causing it to freeze irregularly. This is not necessarily a defect in the product, but they could improve it by adding a ""lid"" that keeps the bottom even."
5,gift,This order arrived on time and was a gift for our son in law. He loves them and they work very well. Very please with this product.
4,"Really neat, looks great, functional","REALLY hard to get out of the mold lol. My wife cut her finger trying to pry them out so she leaves it to me now. Also because the space in between all 4 of the glass molds doesnt cool as quickly, you can get small bumps in the glass. Its hard to explain but it makes getting them out of the mold a real chore.Once out however, they are really awesome, nice and thick, hold an oz of liquid without issue and are super fun at parties. We spent 2 weeks making them and filled an ice chest that we took to a party with them and they were a huge hit. Great party item!"
4,cool as ice,when i first got this i was expecting the normal kinda ice modes my grandparents had but its silicone so that was a big plus.. the one thing bad about it was when i filled it up with whatever liquid it was hard not to spill the water ever where.
4,only problem the cups are super difficult to take out of silicone,but they are fun. and can make a party a lot more fun. great product no major complaints. maybe running them under water for a bit before trying to remove them would make it easier
4,The Stench!!!!,"1st thing 1st: this product smells like heck (...) and it takes a few uses/washes to go away. However, its easy to use and the ice shooters come out easily. No funny taste or smell, unless you're using tainted water of course. It does melt quite fast but let's face it: you're not using this to slowly savour a rare single malt brought back from an epic journey. You poor the hooch, you grip the thing firmly (watch out for the slip) and you ideally down the liquid in 1, 2 shots max. Good work Fred!"
2,Fun but I may have been given a knock off,The package came quickly but the trays were in small plastic bags with no Fred logo on either the packaging or the trays themselves. The performance was weak too-every cube had large unsightly bumps on the inside which changed the quantity of liquid it could hold. I haven't been able to remove the bumps from the inside of the shots because they form while they freeze.
4,Cheap Fun,These make a great drinking novelty. The only real catch is that it can get hairy when you try and get the glasses out of the mold. I run tap cold water over the mold for about 4-5 seconds and then they generally come out pretty easily. Then they are good for about two shots. Then it's time to get out the actual glassware.
3,"Ok, but don't really work well.","Very fun, but when you fill with liquor, it jumps from air bubble to air bubble and leaks out fast. I found that if I filled the ice tray one fourth at a time, there were few enough bubbles that you could do a shot if you moved quickly. I still haven't tried jello shots, but intend to. Maybe one day I can figure out how to make ice with no bubbles."
5,Really Cool - no pun intended,"Actually the pun was intended... This product was exactly what I had expected and I couldn't be happier. Nice thick piece of silicon and the cubes popped right out after freezing (just run the holder under warm water for a few seconds). The textured bottom is a nice touch and makes them seem like they are really glass. I'm not sure how well the actual ice cube shot glasses are going to function but this holder certainly did its part of the job. I actually just ordered 2 more sets and I would recommend buying at least 2 because... well... the more drinks the better and they are ice after all which means they will melt. Not to mention these things are CHEAP. Practical = no, fun= yes, worth it= absolutely."
5,they're ice!,"they may be the coolest thing you've seen all day, but they're still ice. you really can't complain that they melt after some use, that's not the mold's fault. it works fine, they come out just like the picture shows. they last for one maybe two uses before they start to melt on you. its a cheap and easy way to always have shot glasses on hand for the party, and not having to worry about drunks breaking them... just make sure you make enough!"
5,Great for vodka on cold night,"In Soviet Russia, we don't chill glass, glass chills you.Do wash it by hand twice and discard the first batch to remove any residual silica that results from the manufacturing process (can't be avoided in these type of molds). Else the first batch tastes a tad funky"
2,Wouldnt recommend,The bottom doesnt freeze level so its lop sided. The other thing is when it freezes there is always a big buldge in the inside of the shot glass threw the side. So you can only pour a small shot
4,Awesome,"So I bought these for a birthday party and they were great! The mold held up perfectly and there were no breaks. I love these shot glasses because they are so thick walled that they don't leak or break easily.Pros:-makes thick sturdy shot glasses-actually a shotCons-it was a little tought to get the made glasses out of the moldPointers: be sure to chill any liquor before pouring it into a shot glass made of ice, otherwise it'll melt real fast! Also, these are a bit slippery, but that is expected from something made of ice!Overall the product was awesome!"
5,Great buy!,I used this for ice shot glasses as well as melting gummy bears (only use name brand gummy bears they turn out better) I recommend Haribo gold bears.
2,"Fun novelty, but only for a few minutes","I first ran into the problem of not having enough flat surface space in my freezer (at the time) for this 25 square inch mold, so my first attempt had uneven bottoms. Plus, the shot glasses are a bit annoying to remove from the mold. And since you're making ICE, they'll be slippery to hold and useless at holding any liquid because they're melting very quickly. We couldn't decide which happened more often: dropping them or having leaking holes on the sides. Even worse, if you try with juice, then you'll add stickiness to the equation when it starts melting.They're fun and easy to make, but they take forever to make and the novelty wears off too quickly. With only 4 molds, you'd either have to have buy multiple molds or spend a LONG time preparing enough shot glasses for larger parties."
2,Shot glass mold,They are much bigger than I expected. I was looking for Shot glass size but these are more like 1/4 cup size.
5,Fabulous!,"This product is awesome! My husband and I went for dinner XMAS eve and saw these for the first time! We ordered three sets, two for home and one for the cabin!"
3,wish it was silicone,"A shot glass made of ice to keep a chilly shot. Only con is that I just wish the mold was silicone so it would be easier to pop out the molds. and maybe a set of 6 rather than 4. but either way, it made for a nice shot glass."
5,Great product,"Purchased this originally to give to my brother for his bar. Tried them out, and now I'll probably have to buy another set for my brother, as I'm keeping these for myself. Be careful when you use these. Chilled vodka and tequila shots taste so much better in these 'ice shooters', that you may be tempted to drink more than you originally intended."
4,Fun Item,I bought for my sister's bachelorette party and everyone thought it was amazing. I froze juice and water in them to turn the frozen shot glasses a pink color for her theme. It helped that it was in the middle of the summer too. I made quite a few glasses for the event and had no problems getting them unmolded at all.
3,Drink fast,The trick is to make a ton of these because they start leaking in about 30 seconds. Not just the ice melting but the thing sprouts a leak fast. They are cool for parties but not real practical for the accomplished alcoholic.
5,What a fun item!,"Originally I received this from a friend as a gift and we've had so much fun with it that I bought it for a girlfriend that was turning 21. These are great because it's silicone and they come out of the mold pretty easily. Here are my suggestions to anyone that purchases them: Use a cold beverage in them otherwise they start to melt to quickly. To make more than the four, store them in the freezer on wax paper after removing. Try something fun like adding a bit of grenadine or lime juice after filling with water, it'll settle on the bottom which will end up being the rim of the shot glass and it'll give a bit of flavor with your shot."
3,Its Good if your only making 4,"For a fraternity party i made about 300 of these. The only place they dont melt is in the freezer, even in bags deep inside large coolers of ice these little guys melted to the point of uselessness. If your only maing 4 they are very impressive and add quite a bit of novlety. On average the shot glasses should last around 20 minutes at room temperature, handling room temperature alcohol. It also helps if you put these in the freezer for at least double the suggested time ( 8 or so hours)"
4,cool party idea,It's a great idea for a party or 21st gift because it's unique and unexpected. They work for the most part. Sometimes air holes are created that allows for your drink to leak out. Other times the bottoms aren't totally flat and i don't understand the cause for this. I think you just need a really flat surface for them to form and to just check that they have friezed properly. When they do frieze properly their a lot of fun. They come out of the container relatively easily as it's very flexible and not hard plastic.Also one reason why i choose this over other similar products was it's faceted bottom. It gives it a different design than the others and i consider it easier to hold onto rather than a cylinder. Something to consider.
4,Fun and original but not practical.,"This is such a cool item that it pains me not to give it 5 stars, but it certainly has its flaws.The idea is great and the execution is good. Shooters are easy to make and removal is not too hard. The only problem is that it gets messy pretty quickly. As soon as you get it out it starts melting especially when there's a bunch of people and the temperature is warm.If you put it on a table it gets messy, and if it gets forgotten there for a full night you'll get water everywhere! It can also have some leaks if you break it while removing it.It is still a really cool gift, but once the novelty wears off you don't use it that much.Pros:-Original-Useful-Reasonably pricedCons:-Messy-Fragile"
5,Wow!,"Lots of great technique *and* beautiful music, despite what other reviewers may say. The opening statement in CIRCUITO is pretty jarring and may strike some listeners as being nonmusical, but it's actually pretty similar to the unaccompanied jags Brad Mehldau occassionally takes, a little chaos before the return of order. Includes some really beautiful readings of SANDINO, SILVER HOLLOW, BLUE IN GREEN, among others. I got this two months ago and have been listening to it as much all my other CDs combined. Really outstanding jazz."
5,Amazing,"If you're a true Ani fan, you need this book! She's unbelievably talented - Verses is a perfect addition to all her albums."
2,if i had known it was just her lyrics....,"For a slim volume of verse, I kinda expected it to have only previously unprinted poems. There were a few, and those new ones were really enjoyable. Her other song lyrics were really enjoyable when I read them the first time, like 15 years ago, but I was disappointed to see that this small book was almost entirely recycled."
5,Why is the price so high?,"I mean I love the album but the price is way to much. I'm glad I got the mp3 version. This dude is doing it right here, he's a talented producer, vocalist, lyricist who could ask for anything more. I recommend it. Just don't pay that price. Sorry but the economy is to bad for prices like that."
2,gotta be honest,"i would be lying if i said i love this cd.i bought this album based on my connection i had on the first two worship circle records- i LOVE those albums. this cd isn't really in the same catergory- it doesn't have the energy, the uniqueness to it that the first ones did. it's hard for me to listen to this cd straight through- it is very repetitious. the sons just don't catch me and are just too similar.i reccomend that if you are buying this because you like the original worship cicle's stuff, you should listen to samples on itunes or something first..."
3,Needs more...,"Of 182 pages, only 29 are about Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo. Also, there is too much emphasis on restaurants and hotels and not enough information about the location. I am fairly confident that I can find a place to eat when the time comes. What I want to know is: ""what is there to see and do?""However, the information that is in the book is helpful and well-written. I would recommend this book as a place to start but not a complete or even moderate guide."
2,At least you know where to stay,"I found this book to be disapointing. It seems to be pretty good at listing where to stay and where to eat but greatly lacks in the ""what to do"" department. Supposedly written by someone who has lived and traveled extensively in Mexico you might think the book would be filled with an insider's view on where to go and what to do. I'm going by cruise ship and they've provided me with more information on what there is to do in these places than this guide. I'd put this on the ""there's got to be a better guide"" list and pass it by."
5,Precioso!!,"En este CD podemos ver una nueva faceta de Sergio Dalma, entregandonos lo mejor de si, como siempre.. Muy bonito."
4,Slow but spot on,"If you have ever had to staff a booth at an expo or community fair, and are not the particularly outgoing type, you will appreciate this movie. Nestor Carbonell (script writer and star) does a great job of conveying the anguish and dread of waiting for someone to stop by the table and dreading it when they do. The bulk of the film takes place in K-Mart, and trust me, it's spot on."
1,bad bad bad bad bad,By far the worst movie I have ever seen. I was physicially painful to finish it. I feel cheated over the loss of 2 hours of my life.
5,A wonderful book that exposes the wonders of the small.,A fantastic book very much along the lines of Sigurd Olson's brilliant nature prose and yet not far from Aldo Leopold's writings. A must if you like or have any interest in sound or insects. You'll never listen to the world outside the same way again!!
4,halogen lights,"Lights are fine, work as expected. Only down side was that one of the two bulbs included did not work."
5,Read this book!,I was extremely impressed with the insight and effectiveness of the advice provided by this book. It was very practical and the book was surprisingly fun and easy to read. I highly reccomend this book.
4,Real S.A.S,Both discs have the same content 1 has been remastered and the other is the Blue Ray edition.Its worth watching the film with the commentary on.The films producer actually admits now some 28 years later that the SAS scenes were the SAS and not actors/stunt men.And that Lewis Collins was actually in 21 SQDN.SAS which is the Territorial unit.
4,Who Dares Win,"A very good movie made on 1982 when it was originally titles ""The Final Option"" about terrorist seizing the London Air Force Unit. Great actors played by Richard Widmark and Judi Davis. The Blue ray was new, played in machine fine except the picture was moving but you can watch the movie. Excellent condition."
5,Incredible book!,I am a neuroscientist PhD candidate and this book was what originally made me interested in neuroscience!
2,The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"Disappointing purchase.The story is wonderful, and the merchant handled thisorder with speed and care. Highest rating to them both.But the book was dimly printed on flimsy paper, and notworth the money for that reason only."
5,wonderful,"Here is a great and humanizing collection of true 'clinical tales' told by Dr. Sacks. The various case studies exhibit the often startling conditions that can arise from unusual brain (dis)function. Each chapter contains a short story of Sacks' interaction with a particular person and their unusual condition as well as Sacks' own sometimes self-indulgent, but almost always insightful discussion of the deeper meaning, profound details, and inspiration one can discover through the person's (often tragic) situation. I found the examples of agnosia (inability to interpret stimuli), and also loss of proprioception (sense of one's own body) to be particularly fascinating."
4,Informative and entertaining,"Oliver Sacks does an amazing job of telling very interesting stories while maintaining an informative atmosphere for the readers. I found that the postscripts for many of the chapters took away from the feeling of the book as a whole. The postscripts are often heavily weighed down with medical information which can be hard to follow. The characters within the stories are very interesting, and it is nice to read how Sacks interacts with each character. Some chapters are much more captivating than others, ""The Lost Mariner"" and ""Witty Ticcy Ray"" to name a few. Although background information is a necessary part of understanding the characters, there are some chapters that have pages and pages of background information and then the story itself is not very long. Despite these minor flaws, Oliver Sacks delivers a wonderful collection of stories that are both informative and entertaining for any reader."
5,Fascinating Read,"Oliver Sacks' book, ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" is a truly fascinating read. The stories were extremely intriguing and thought provoking. Some stories really made you think about how complicated our mind and body can be. You can really see the power of the brain and the mind after reading this book. One story, ""This disembodied lady"" stood out for me. I was dumbfounded by the fact that anything like that could happen to a seemingly normal person. Another aspect of the book that I liked was the simple language. Sacks wrote this book with the average reader in mind. I have little knowledge of neuroscience or science for that matter, yet I had no trouble following along with the text. Dr. Sacks is also an extremely experienced doctor with a vast knowledge of neuroscience. He knows what he is talking about and it shows in the book. He also seems to care very much about his patients and gives us a wholesome description of the patient's background."
3,"Interesting, but hard to pay attention","I really wanted to like this book, but in the end I had to work to finish. The patients and diagnoses are really interesting. But, the writing style made it a little hard for me to keep paying attention, he kept repeating things, and there was some conspicuous name-dropping. Overall worth the time spent reading but not as good as I'd hoped."
5,"24 Fasinating, Bizarre Neurological Case Studies","This is probably Sacks' best book for the general reader because he avoids copious footnotes and long, convoluted asides. He tells the fascinating stories of two dozen neurological patients, and I found the book both delightful to read and amazing to ponder. It's the best book of medical case studies out on the market."
4,Brains amiss,"Entertaining reading about the workings of the bizarro mind. Superman never met people more off center than you'll meet here. The kind of honest, deeply held perception errors these people make lead me to question my own grasp on the real world.Good to read, but there are a few places where you might want to skip ahead without missing anything."
3,"Exists on 2 levels, one better than the other","This book could be read on two levels: in a clinical sense, with its million-dollar scientific terms and long winded, detailed description of methods and diagnoses; and in an anecdotal sense, as stories about quirky, remarkable characters. After reading a bit, I preferred to continue reading with the latter approach in mind, and was distracted by the clinical stuff. I felt it really took away from the amazing stories therein. Additionally, Sacks was kind of self-aggrandizing, and didn't so much place his patients as the book's center as he did himself, and his assessment of their eccentricities."
5,Fascinating and brilliant,This is my favorite book! It's fantastic! You can't put it down and the stories stay with you for years. You can pick it up in any chapter and it's quite funny as well. Beautifully written.
4,Cool read :-),"Loved this book, it's dated a little but the stories and people are so engaging and real- it's worth a look."
2,"Exaggerations,falsehoods and facts mixed for material gain.","Its about time that people started seeing past sacks carefully cultivated media image of genial genius to reveal what he really is;a self promoting, vulgar, ego-maniacal perpetrator of clinical lies and exaggerations for the purpose of personal gain.A writer of consumate skill,he easily dupes 'lay people'into believing the veracity of each case.seasoned medical practitioners would,I hope,be able to detect the whiff of bull-faeces that surrounds him."
1,Suspicious -- read with caution,"I don't know... things seem a little too tidy with Dr. Sachs' stories. His characters are always ""charming"" persons, with ""delightful"" senses of humor. The title character is such a person who also happens to be a brilliant musician and painter, whose paintings, by golly, morph with time to trace the onset of his disease. His second subject, a man who cannot form new memories (like the protagonist in a later Hollywood film, Memento) nonetheless finds himself getting bored solving old puzzles. (If you can't remember anything, how does boredom set in?) In another account, he assigns super-human powers of discernement to a room full of otherwise incapcitated patients as they laugh at a broadcast of a political figure that Sachs obviously doesn't like. Be careful how seriously you take these stories, nothing jazzes up a tall tale like a claim of authenticity."
1,NO tracking number,There is no tracking number when the description said there would be. This is inexcusable. there should always be a tracking number so people can see how long its going to take for their product should arrive.
2,A hard struggle to read it till the end.,"My neurologist indicated this book to me with a lot of good accolades and I was pretty much anxious about reading it asap. What a disapointment!!True, the author is a pretty much well-known specialist on brain disorders and pretty much devoted to dismmiss a lot of prejudice one has against people with severe brain disorders, deserving all the accolades my neurologist has put on him, but it seems that (at least in the Portuguese edition I have read) the lackluster style of the texts do a lot of harm to the intensiveness of the narrative, which goes trough the lives of brain impaired people as if they were fictional characters and not real persons.I hope next time, the author will be more successfull in portraying situations like the ones presented in the book, which he surely knows a lot, but which he is not so much efficient to convey to readers like myself."
1,horribly cruel and unempathetic tone,"God save you if you were mentally ill and your doctor turned out to be Sacks. Clearly these people amuse him... well they are not actually people, per se, just malfunctioning brain mechanisms. Disgustingly evil managerie of circus animals he parades in front of the reader. Hard to read if you feel sympathy for these unfortunate human beings who depend on Sacks for care."
4,What a fantastic thing the brain is,"In this book we are first presented with case stories of patients that more or less convince you that the brain is a kind of mechanical contraption. Strange things happens when parts of this contraption is damaged. These stories of loss are interesting and puts you in awe: What a fantastic thing the brain is!But there is more. The story about the [twins] left me baffled. With an IQ of 60 they couldn't do simple additions or subtractions. And certainly they couldn't do multiplications or divisions. But nevertheless their brains could somehow master 20 digits primes. Without using any ""methods"" they could somehow ""sense"" whether such an enormous number was a prime or not. This twin story alone makes the book worthwhile.-Simon"
3,A little book about a big subject.,"Oliver Sacks is a Clinical Professor of Neurology, and many of his patients have had brain disorders that have manifested themselves in bizarre and often surprising ways.This book is a collection of stories about some of these patients and the profound effect the brain disorders have had on their lifes, and ways of thinking.The stories are in turn traumatic,funny,sad,and often unbelievable,more suited to sci-fi than a medical journal.The chapters are an easy read for your average layman but the postscripts that follow these chapters are full of medical jargon that only medical students or doctors can appreciate.This book made me think about the grey matter between my ears in a different light, and also of how little we know about this complex organ that makes us what we are.The only downside to this book was the author's theological ramblings."
4,The brain insights,Very detailed case-accounts of fascinating aspects of brain function and truly enjoyable reading. well written-a must read for those interested in and intrigued by the human brain!
3,Good,"While reading ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"" I had the feeling I was reading a book written by a serious doctor who has the giddy sense of also being a writer. Sacks has a good hand at writing, more or less, until he steers into the circular quagmire of medical and philosophical notation. The case studies are fascinating, often eerie, tales of bodies and mental wiring gone mad. Less cheers for the medical explanations that dips too far into scientific minutiae."
5,Wonderful book!,I bought this book years ago and I still think it's one of the best I ever read. It's a permanent part of my library.
3,Interesting but superficial overview of clinical cases,"Reading this book, I felt like touring a museum of curiosities, getting an overview of a large number of clinical case, without any in-depth analysis or understanding of the patients. Overall, the book felt cold and detached and I found myself wanting to know more about each person described, on their personality. They felt too much like lab experiments instead of human beings. However, the scientific aspects seemed well researched, solid and à-propos.I recommend Sacks'""An Anthropologist on Mars"" as a better read, for more in-depth studies of fewer cases."
3,Interesting But Left Me Wanting,"You've probably heard of Dr. Oliver Sacks--the neurologist whose collections of patient case studies have been the subject of various books and movies (including Awakenings). I'd been familiar with Oliver Sacks for years (my dad had many of his books) but never actually read any of his books. Despite the fascinating case studies described in the book (idiot savants, Left Neglect, memory loss), I found the writing off-putting and never really engaged with the book. I think it was a combination of Sack's writing style (which might be too clinical despite being accessible) and my need for more personal details and depth than Sacks was able to offer."
5,Endlessly fascinating.,"I've read this book several times now, and own it in both tree and ebook form.It's fascinating to see how injury or mal-development of the brain can affect people in such wide ranging and such _strange_ ways.Some of the stories are quite moving - for example the twins who, though in many ways developmentally challenged, had the most extraordinary knack for prime numbers. Their delight in the numbers is almost infectious even through the printed page, which only serves to make their separation all the more painful.Not only are these stories fascinating, they give the reader much to think about in how our brains work and fail to work. Lots to interest the curious mind."
5,Great read from a great author,"Many years ago, one of my son's teachers recommended this book when I spoke with her about my gifted son. Oliver Sacks presents his views and knowledge of neurological phenomenons. He explains in a lighthearted way how amazing the human brain is and works through stories of patients and professionals who deal with neurological difficulties. My son's abilities in mathematics, music and linguistics far exceed those of his peers since kindergarten. His Tourette Syndrome has challenged him throughout his life and has proven that his disability is not a handicap but a blessing. This book is worth the read and money,and I highly recommend it."
4,Read it (4/5 - Good),"That book is pretty good! Some patients are really interesting, others are forgettable. The writing is good and you should read it!"
2,Not for the lay person,"This book describes some very interesting cases; people with brain damage or tumors or simply idiopathic. However, it is presented in a manner that is much too clinical, and sometimes repetitious, to be an enjoyable read."
1,Not much interesting content for me,"To me, it's a slightly entertaining book. If you have not seen any of the cases before, the book may impress you. But once you knew some of these cases before, or how our human mind works, what the book ends up is a lot of personal interpretations based on years of experience, but without any really good answers. Also it's way too technical to be an enjoyable read. I had to skip a lot of pages."
4,"Nice, Sweet","This book has wonderful little wisdoms every father should hand down to their son(s), but often run out of time to do so or just forget about the small things that really matter."
4,Some life changing lyrics,"Listen to the words to ""Hollow Man"" & ""I'm not calling in Sick...I'm calling in gone"" Could anyone say it better?"
1,Not worth 5 bucks,"This is a very out dated book, which is focused on win 3.1 The author does a poor job explaining the insides to windows programming. The book comes with a diskette that does not work (in my case the files are corrupted) and there is no online site to get them from. Please, don't throw your money away, if you want this book email me and I'll send it to you for free."
2,Poor production values,"I am not sure if this is good stuff or not. I can't get past the poor production value. This is a Chinese product that is overdubbed in English. It's easy to understand and follow along, but the cheesy backgrounds are sooo distracting. It's shot mainly on green screen and then stupid stuff is put in the background to make it more interesting. I would have preferred just keeping it simple and focusing on the content. I have only watched it once because I can't take it. Good thing it was only $20."
4,ok,"This game is just okay to me. I don't find it all that fun, it was kind of hard for me at first. Sad, huh. lol"
2,"If you loved Yoshi's Island, you'll be disappointed","I don't know how Nintendo did it, but they took a great series and ruined it. I got so bored with this game that I simply stopped playing it halfway through. Yes the tilt sensor is a novel concept and it could have worked well, but the game play just isn't there.Why is it so bad?* Levels are far too easy. There is hardly any challenge* Just another token collection game* No end of world bosses* Annoying characters that have nothing to do with the Mario-Yoshi universe* Annoying musicShame on you Nintendo for releasing this game. Do they really think they can just market their games to kids forever while forgetting the former generation that grew up with Nintendo?"
2,"An Interesting Game, but Yoshi can do Better!","This isn't exactly the best Yoshi game in the world. I bought it a few months ago, and started playing it immediately. The first level was okay, but right after that, it got a bit dull. I didn't care for it after that, and have not played it since."
1,"My stomach goes ""Topsy Turvy"" with this game!!","I do not like this game at all. I didn't realize when it said that you had to tilt your GB to get the game to work, that you literally had to be on one of those pirate ships at an amusement park to get the game to work properly!!"
3,This game is lame,Yoshi Topsi Turbi or however you spell the damn game is not worth the 30 dollar price tag at most game stores. Yes i no its new but im warning you it sucks crap. You move your Game boy around to move yoshi and have the time it does not work and it is STRICTLY a kids game. But even kids will get sick of constantly dying. Yea its that bad. So dont kill your money and waste it on something else you dont need like water. Im not reccommending this game. But who the hell is going to listen to me
4,Fun but Semi-Easy,"I absolutely love this game!! To play, you turn the game system to change the elevation of the ground that Yoshi is on and the way that things roll or move. It works remarkably well! I have read other reviews of some other game like this and they said that the turning mechanism was faulty. I guarrantee you that this game works like magic! I am amazed at both this and the quality of the graphics. What a creative idea Nintendo had! I haven't yet played all of the Mario games, but I am most definitely working on that I can assure you. The ones that I have played so far have provided me with countless hours of fun! My only negative comment about this game is that it is not long enough and somewhat easy in the early stages. Have fun!"
2,I like Sylvia's writing better,I am still working on reading this book. It was written by Sylvia's Spirit Guide Francine. Francine is a little more difficult for me to follow. I prefer Sylvia's writing myself.
1,Nothing new,"As a big Sylvia Browne fan, I am very disappointed to give this book a low mark. I've read all her books and this one has all the same information. As much as I don't want to believe it, I'm starting to think maybe she IS only after making money. And she didn't even write this, her ""Spirit Guide"" wrote it from the Other Side. I don't know-I truely don't believe she's fraudulent. She's helped so many. But I have caught her in a lie. On January 3, 2000, she appeared on Montel and when asked about celebrity couples who would stay together, she said Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman would remain married. A year later, they divorced and Sylvia was back on Montel and said ""I knew all along"".And how do you justify [the money] per question just to ask her spirit guide Francine, something? I do think she's for real but it makes me sad that ordinary people like me who can't afford a $700 reading are out of luck."
4,Good book but,"I agree with ""A reader from rhinebeck, ny, usa"". I'm a new fan and was telling an old fan about the book and she knew what I was talking about, even though she never read it. The readings good though. Very interesting view on life and death. Only giving a 4 because I know she was just repeating her old work."
2,"review,review,review","this book is a review of the past books. I have to agree with all of the reviews that I have read, there is truth in all of them. No doubt, Sylvia is great, but lately her books are starting to be redundant of each other. I do enjoy her newsletters though, have any of you subscribed to it? I guess sylvia is just trying to remind us, even if it is redundant, the messages that we need to remember, ""take whatever applies to us and use it"" and to remember to"" Love""(aloha), THAT will save the human race .aloha to all."
1,Conversations With the Other Side,"I found the messages this book attempted to convey indulgent, sexist, and to quote Francine &#65533;chauvinistic&#65533;. The idea of people being locked in a gender for an eternity seems to me a bit restrictive not to mention the rather earthly marriage rituals (waiting for the men to initiate the process of eternal union). I am not even going to go into the counsel of elders comprised of only male spirits. And tough luck for you introverts, obviously you have not evolved to the level of your extroverted counterparts. While I like to read intelligently written books about dimensions other than the one we live in, I found that even for a fantasy book this was lacking imagination. Perhaps Francine would do well to stick to her parties, it seems that they very much color her worldview. This book made me feel sad, angry and gullible for buying it. It was my first book from this author and needless to say my last."
1,Her worst book yet!!!,"A skimpy(large type&wide margins) rehash of her previous books.I suppose it would be okay for someone new to Sylvia, but there are much better books out there such as Michael Newton's."
4,good book,"This was a rather interesting book about cultural history of Russia. It did get monotonous at times but still, interesting enough to read. I think it would be invaluable to someone who knows nothing about Russia's culture."
4,Not sure about the title?,"I ordered this at the same time as Land of the Firedbird, another book about Russia, and I liked the latter better."
3,Natasha's Dance,"I'm still in the middle of this thick book, and I find it fascinating--but my Russian colleagues tell me is it not altogether trustworthy in its portrayal of Russian history and culture, so I'm looking at it with an eye toward possible problems. That said, it is an eminently readable, fun way to get through a lot of the history of this endlessly fascinating country."
1,!,"This book is completely out of date. The problem with most books on Russian culture is their narrow-mindedness; they all follow the same old path established at the beginning of the 20th century by White Russians who escaped the revolution and created the history of Russia and Russian culture for Westerners. Such ""histories"" are one-sided, they see the subject from one pro-Russian prospective. Ukraine and Ukrainian culture/art do not exist in such books. But Ukrainian culture always was the avant-garde of MOST Russian cultural developments. It is time for scholars to realize it. The Cold War is over."
3,Stein's book - Not the easist read,Stein has a unique style of writing that is not for everyone. I think it will take some dedicated time to get through this novel.
1,The batteries are JUNK,"I purchased the 0622-24 in October of 2003. The drill itself is one of the best I have ever owned but the batteries are JUNK. Now this may not seem like much of a problem, but the first one is dead in 18 months of occasional use. The replacement cost is $79.95. I expect the second battery to die shortly, another $79.95. If so, that's $159.90 every 18 months for a tool that currently costs $222.00. Although I can't prove it, I suspect that Milwaukee ships batteries with the tool that don't quite measure up so they can screw us over for the replacement batteries they know we will have to buy. Again, I like the tool itself but would think twice about the cost of the batteries you will have to buy once you lock into the tool."
2,Weak battery and difficulty taking battery off,"I do not recommend this drill. The battery failed within a year and the new 18 volt NiCad is failing again after about another year. I use it only occasionally so the comment regarding battery failure in this tool for DIY resonates.Also, I don't think the tool lives up to its torque claims. Finally, the battery from day one has been difficult to remove. The side squeeze mechanism never worked properly."
1,NOT Made in USA,"Received the Milwaukee 0622-24 Kit today. Haven't used it yet. It MAY be a fine tool, but it is NOT made in USA. The drill is made in the Czech Republic, the batteries in Japan and the charger in China. Be forewarned that you are paying a lot for the name and if it is important to you to buy American-made products, this is NOT one! I'm very disappointed and will not buy Milwaukee again."
3,Milwaukee batteries are Ni-Cd,"I don't own this drill, but I do know why so many folks have had battery problems. The 18V batteries that Milwaukee includes with this drill are nickel cadmium. Nicads are known for having ""memory"" problems caused by recharging batteries before they are fully discharged. And here is a gem of a quote from the wikipedia - ""NiCd batteries, when not used regularly, tend to develop dendrites (thin, conductive crystals), causing internal short circuits and premature battery failure, long before the 800-1000 charge/discharge cycles claimed by most vendors."" Bam!This means that if you are an occasional user (weekend warrior), you'd be better off with a different brand that uses Nickel metal-hydride batteries. They are less prone to the problems described above. The 18V drills made by Makita, Panasonic, and Bosch all use NiMh batteries. Dewalt 18V drills come with NiCd."
5,Quality Tool,"This Tool is incredible, I upgraded from the Makita 18 volt. It was like moving from a Model T to a Mercedes. The balance is correct and I am sure to find a situation that will utilize the reversing battery mount.The chuck really locks the bit in place. The clutch seems to be calibrated the same as the Makita and I have yet to break a screw.It seems slightly heavier than the Makita but the comfortable grip makes up for itI can recommend this product to any serious wood worker or to anyone that uses a Battery powered drill frequently"
5,Milwaukee 18 volt cordless drill.,"For openners, I have high regard for Milwaukee products. This drill, so far, is living up to my high expectations. My experience is that the batteries that come with Milwaukee cordless tools, seem to hold up very well.I love my Milwaukee cordless tools.RHS"
3,I cant say I like this that much,"No doubt there are some really typical KK & KK on this disc. None better than track 14. Full on galactic bass line in that one with a up tempo star catching beat. But in general, Kutmasta lays down some beats that are just to soft for these guys. Still the album is worth it for this track alone and there are a couple other tracks such as Break U off that deserve mention."
1,prob worst keith release ever,no artist comes to mind that has such a range of terrible to great....and this is terrible. It wouldn't surprise me if keith n kurt put this together in like 2 days.
5,Some ill new stuff,"Honestly the first time I heard this album, I was not to sure. Though now it is completely obvious to me that this one of the best albums in the Kool Keith collection. The production is tight !!!!!!! some crazy tracks - Serve em a sentence - I drop money - bamboozled - and Kenworths with wings, just to name a few.Don't let anyone fool you this album is ill !!"
4,Keith is Amazing,"Keith does it again. This album is raw, once again proving that he's a vet when it comes to the rap game. My favorite track is #2, but they're all great. The reason I only gave it 4 stars though because it wasn't anything that new. He's sounded like this before but it's that style that I love, so I gave it a 4. If you're a KK fan then go get this album. If you've never heard him before I wouldn't recommend that you start with this album though, go get Black Elvis or Dr. Dooom. Keith, you're one hell of a rap artist."
5,Hes over your head thats why u dont think its a 5 star...,"If you only new what mc'n was about. ""My funky type of rhyme and my style is psycho"" lets cee Eminem is crazy. Tupac is Thug political style. Paris Political. KRS1 Philospher. Dead Prez. Rev.Gangs.Pol. and so on... kool kieth is my fav. artist of all time...then tupac then face...

3,avoid purchase of medical supplies,"I would have liked to have been informed of the expiry date on the products as they werefor medical use, and being 6 months out of date was unacceptable!!"
4,Wound Care,"Needed for an abdominal wound. Worked well. Unfortunately, it expired the next month, but I dont go by that anyways. I see some people being upset by that though."
1,Pure Pulp,"Another review for this book contends that you can ""marvel at the pictures for hours."" Absolutely correct. You can marvel at how poor the picture quality is. You can marvel at the terrible grade of paper used. Mostly, you can marvel at the fact that someone actually deemed this worth publishing."
4,"Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms by Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney","A rare and penetrating account of the lives and thoughts of Kamikaze pilots, as revealedthrough their letters, and the memories of their relatives and of the few survivors. Illustratesthe educated cosmopolitan world views of this the cream of Japanese youth of the 1940sand the brutality of their officers who forced and shamed them into suicidal performances.Some have suggested that the data used may not have been typical of all tokutaipilots (of planes and one man submarines).Nelson Graburn, Visiting Prof Emeritus, Minpaku, Suita, Osaka"
1,Not what I expected.,The title is misleading. The product only gives a brief history of Tai Chi; not the actual movements.
2,"Run, don't walk, away from this book","This is a 1998 reprint of a 1990 book. It has numerous typos, transposed photos, and little updating. Worst is that it treated the ""Brocket collection"" as an ongoing enterprise in 1998 when by then the lord had been doing time..."
2,loud as hell as well as cheap as hell,loud as hell 4 AA battery and it sounds like the end of the world just what you would want if someone came in your home. Hey it may not call the cops but if you put a fake sticker near it like security device logged to police station I would run away. They will be deaf it they stayed to rob you.
4,inexpensive security,"i used in a deposit, i will like it louder but it have an option to use an external speaker. i have not tried yet but still it is a great alarm."
3,Good book for the novice,"This book gives a great overview of the agricultural commodities markets of the world. It covers how the futures markets work, why they came into existence, and how they can be used to manage risk. The first six chapters are the most useful for the majority of readers; they focus mostly on the corn, soybeans, and wheat futures exchanges in the midwest United States. Several later chapters cover European exchanges and minor world exchanges. Don't expect to become a trader after reading this book, but it's a great place to get started learning about agricultural futures and options."
2,Confusing/possibly defective,"I've found a way to make it work, but all the pieces came apart and they don't fit together and it'd be nice if it came with a picture/diagram of how they're supposed to work together (I'd still like to think the problem is on my end and I didn't waste my money). Frustrating, and I'm pretty disappointed. =["
5,incredible,"This is the first CD I've physically bought in about 5 years, and even though I didn't love a couple of the songs, it was well worth it for the good ones. Check out Terrace, VH1, Rock Chk, The Love, and the rest are mostly great too. You will not find this on iTunes, not on Amazon, not in US stores.. buy the import."
5,BEST TV SHOW EVER!,"From the acting, to the story, to the drama, everything about this show is amazing. It is definitely the best show on ABC family!"
4,Good but skips.,There is nothing wrong with the show i love it and its so adicting. I missed the first season so i bought this to catch up on what i missed. When i started wathing these with my friends they started to skip. The disc looked fine though.
5,Best Ever,"My friends were telling me about Pretty Little Liars and how good the show was. I was not caught up with the First Season and looked everyone online Netflix, hulu, etc. and no one had the complete first season. For 1.99 per episode I decided to download everyone from Amazon. Good quality, loving the episodes so much. If you are into a good perplexing show try the first episode, you will get hooked."
4,delicious,"Pretty Little Liars is a new favorite of mine. The writing is so good. It keeps you emotionally invested in the characters, and also on the edge of your seat trying to guess what will happen next. Bravo to ABC for seeing the potential in this storyline and executing it so deliciously. Also, the theme song is perfect."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I bought this DVD series on a whim as I am a huge Holly Marie Combs fan. But I could not stop watching. I finished the entire first season in 2 days. I was so wrapped up in the show I couldn't stop. It kept me on the edge of my seat guessing who 'A' was/is. Anyone who came in my house for these two days, like myself, had never seen this show and got into it instantly. Do not pass this series up. Sooooo Good, OMG!!!!!!!!!"
5,Pretty Little Liars,"I ordered this for my daughter's birthday. It arrived promptly and without any problems. The packaging was clean, neat and without crushing or dents. She is enjoying it very much and has had no problems playing any of the DVDs."
4,Bittersweet,As for the service and delivery i have absolutely no complaints. The only thing that i was upset about was the way the disks are enclosed I was about to take out the first disk and it broke so now i cant watch the first disk. The disks need to be placed diferently!
4,Fast delevery,I was very pleased by getting the shipment a week ahead of the scheduled delevey date.Pretty Little Liars: The Complete First Season
2,"Pretty girls, not much else there","When the mother began having sex with a cop who was prosecuting her daughter for stealing a pair of sunglasses, I knew it would be bad. Would this really ever happen? And she kept doing it. BS meter went through the roof. The girls are so hot that at times I turned off the dialogue; it interfered with my appreciation of 20 year olds playing high schoolers. And I've never seen that much makeup on anyone in high school.I am not going to continue the series or buy any additional episodes."
3,stupid show,"I only watched a few episodes because I think it's horrible but my teenage daughter loves the show, it is a teen soap opera"
3,DVD Series,I bought this for a gift for my girlfriend. Great buy for people that love this show. Came fast and great buy.
1,Dissaponting and painful at times,"The first episode was about a 4 out of 10 for me and then went down in subsequent episodes. I watched the whole first season since I paid for it and thought there mught be a good payoff in the end but unforunately this was not the case. The storylines become so dramatic and silly. The 16 year olds seem to be more intelligent than the adults. The storylines of a mysterious stalker are not addressed by the police and it is never clear why the girls feel they need to be so secretive. The target audience of this show is probably 14-16 year old girls but it is not appropriate for this age group- for example one of the girls is dating her teacher while one of the girl's mother feels she need to sleep with a cop in exchange for helping her daughter, drama for drama's sake. Disapointing as there is real potential. It remionded me a bit of a teanage depersate housewives at first."
3,Shipping of DVD set,I was very disappointed when I opened the shipping envelope to find that the dvd case was crushed on the hinge side. The packing didn't protect the case which would be nice to keep the discs in since there are so many discs. At least the dvd's weren't damaged.
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!,"Seriously, one of the BEST SHOWS ON TV! By far the best show on ABC Family, pure and simple! I'm hooked! Can't wait for the new episodes! So addicting! Can't wait for summer!"
5,"Addictive, creepy, emotional, thrilling! Love this show!","I absolutely adore this TV show! Is one of the best ones out there. I'm only sorry not to had given it a try before, but I went on a bought the DVD and started watching it and got hooked since the first episode! (I also plan to buy the book) It really is that good! I won't summarize the plot because most people have already done so. I'll just go ahead and say that this show is a total roller coaster ride! You think you're going up and you find yourself down again back and forth. A lot of twists and turns and nothing is ever what it seems or how you think it is. I just love it so much! Fans of The Vampire Diaries will also love this show because it is as suspenseful and addictive as TVD! Those two are my all time favorite TV shows! Keep up the good work PLL! And watch out because someone is out to get you!!! - A"
4,PPL,Had to get in on DVD just to watch the bonus stuff and see how the girls are together in real life. I love the series. It's soo suspensful and the end of each episode will leave you with wanting more. It will become you're new obsession.
5,Secrets revealed!,"Perfect product, just as advertised. Very prompt shipping!Now that I have watched the first season of Pretty Little Liars, I finally understand what is happening on the show this season. If you missed season 1 and now can't get enough of this show, you NEED this DVD!"
5,LOVE!,"I'm obsessed with this show. It's absolutely amazing. I preordered and it arrived on the day that it was released, I'm so grateful to have been able to buy this item."
5,very quick delivery,"I am very satified with purchase. Delivery time was much less than expected and dvd arrived in pristine conditionas far as packaging goes. Since this is a gift, I don't know yet how it plays but don't believe there will be a problem as it appears new."
1,"Gossip Girl minus the great writing,",intrigue and attractive cast. The first episode was slow; the show didn't pick up. I thinking the audience for this is catty rich girls and their angry divorced mothers.
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"""Sleazy Little Tramps"" would be a better title for this show. This is not ""family"" television unless we're talking about the Manson family values. If the people on this show don't seriously creep you out, I would wonder about you. And the dialogue is a bunch of cheap clichés, recited by bad actors, strung together with an improbable and dull mystery, and spiced up with lots of perversion. I've read that people watch the show for fashion tips. If it were any good, you wouldn't notice the clothes. Save your time and money and page through a fashion magazine instead."
3,"Great Information, Easy Read, Cut and Dry","I picked this book up for a coupe bucks at a used book store. It had a lot of practical knowledge, hence the title. As a very broad book on finance, it introduces various investment routes and personal finance strategies including: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, foreign markets, real estate, mortgages, precious metals, taxes, investing for children, investing for retirement, choosing a broker, etc. It's a book for those with beginner finance knowledge and funds that are looking to invest. It's very cut and dry, which is good if you want to sift through information fast or look up ideas, but I didn't find it enjoyable to read."
5,Aliens Among Us,I loved this TV movie years ago. Took a long time to find it on DVD. It's really campy sort of like Carnival of Souls.
3,The Stranger Within Review,"I loved Barbara Eden. So I bought this movie. It's OK. Not her best work, but quite watchable. She doesn't show her belly button here either."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVE,"I loved this made for television movie as a kid in 1974.Barbara Eden and George Grizzard were awesome. In 1974 Irecorded the movie on my (tape recorder):). The music ischilling, and perfect for the backdrop of the California hillswhere it was filmed. I had a chance to meet Barbara Eden inPhiladelphia, PA several years ago. I told her how much Ienjoyed this flick. She is a very beautiful and classy lady,and this movie shall always be one of my personal favorites.The DVD is a proud part of my library."
1,The Stranger Within,"I had recorded this on VHS and wanted a copy on DVD. When I saw Amazon had it, I was excited and ordered it. I ordered TWO and neither would play on my normal/average Panasonic DVD player ! Was very disappointed and that is why I want my money back !"
1,Cody needs to be a human or another animal instead of a cow!,"The book is ok, HOWEVER, now my 3 year old twins see cartoon depictions of cows on milk and cheese products in the store and say, ""Look! It's Cody!"". I have to explain to them that it's NOT Cody and you shouldn't eat anything with a cow on the package.Mother of twins - allergic to milk and peanuts"
5,Murderous Martin,"Martin, a very early film directed by George Romero, is the very definition of an unsung classic horror film. Released on a shoestring budget at the end of the 70's and dismissed by audiences as ""just another slasher film"", audiences missed out on a razor sharp black comedy sprinkled with moments of an ultra-sadistic personality study. Martin just doens't believe he's a vampire. Emotionally and morally, he sucks the blood and life out of all those who trust him and are around him, a perfect allogory for the decade to come. Martin deserves to be seen and appreciated by the masses at this time, if only to observe one of the most ironic and startling final scenes in the history of horrific cinema."
5,An interesting take on the vampire tale.,"Romero has always been somewhat of an oddity in the realm of horror. He manages to squeeze so much into his films that the viewer almost HAS to watch his movie over and over to get it all. Martin is one of those films. Hidden behind his frantic editing, long tracking shots, and remarkably refrained violence is a stong tale of conformity, abandonment, and religious persecution all entered around a 17 year old boy named Martin who thinks he is a vampire. Whether or not Martin is in actuality a vampire is left up to the viewer to decide. He certainly thinks he is, though. Without fangs, he must resort to razor blades to draw blood, a plot device that sets up some rather humorous and well-directed scenes. Early FX work by Tom Savini takes backseat though to Romero's own direction, which is deft and stylish. A great piece of genre work."
5,Simply Amazing,"Most viewers of today are jaded by the formulaic hollywood treatment to modern films. One director has kept the integrity and intelligence to continue making films that are timless classics. Romero's MARTIN is one such flick. Martin (John Amplas) gives a stunning performace of a modern vampire trying to live with his dangerously orthodox uncle (Licoln Maazel). Throughout the film we are treated to a series of events that Martin must overcome such as sexuality, finding blood and avoiding his uncle who is constantly harassing him with garlic, crucifixes and mirrors. The acting from other supporting characters such as Tom Savini is spectacular giving the film a genuine feel. This is the kind of film that stuns you at the end and can be watched multiple times in one day without tiring and trust me nothing is more moving than when Martin finds his love interest lying in a pool of her own...Well I'll let you figure it out."
5,A sad and haunting look at insanity.,"Martin is a disturbed young man who comes to the wasting away town of Braddock to live with his elderly cousin Tata Cuda. Both Martin and Cuda believe that Martin is an 84 year old vampire, not the quiet and shy youth others see. Martin has no supernatural powers (sedative and razors take the place of hypnosis and fangs) and sunlight only bothers his eyes a little when he starts getting 'shaky'. Cuda promises to care for Martin as long as the boy does not take anyone from town...Martin was the movie that proved Night of the Living Dead was not a fluke and that George A. Romero was an intelligent and visionary director in the horror movie arena. John Amplas does a marvelous job making a monstrous character sympathetic. Those wanting cheap thrills need look elsewhere, this is adult horror, disturbing and thought provoking in its look at legend and insanity playing off of each other. Highly recommended."
1,Wish there were a lower rating,"In my 50+ years of movie watching this may very well be the winner, of being absolutely the worst attempt of making a movie I have ever witnessed, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.There is no number low enough to rate this horrible work, part way into viewing this I took the DVD out and folded it over and threw it in the garbage, where it belongs."
4,A horror film unto itself,"One of Romero's greatest. While his ""Dead"" films have gotten the most public attention, this early work exudes a richness that deserves it high praise, indeed. This becomes more and more apparent after repeated watchings. The film tackles several subjects at once (vampirism, industrial town life, personal isolation) and succesfully brings them together. Amplas is superb as a young man struggling with identity. Is this insanity or truly a curse? We are given the chance to decide for ourselves, as no easy answers are forced upon us. For those who like George Romero, for those intrigued by vampirism, for those who appreciate a dose of complexity with their horror: check this film out."
5,there is no magic,"i'm really not one to obsess over vampire flicks but this is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. anyone can enjoy this and find some way to relate, especially a teenager."
5,third brutal hardcover,"collects slavers & barracuda, two stories with a big difference.Slavers was a story about human trafficing in the USA and was the hardest hitting of all punisher max stories.Barracuda was a more mindless fun and violence type of story, which i needed after the first half of this book.I can see why barracuda got his own little spin off because he was really a great addition to the punisher max line.All in all well balanced for fans of the max version of the punisher,cant wait to get the fourth hardcover."
3,"Looks great, wish it was a little softer","This looks great on my ""ice gray"" colored tub, and stays in place just fine. I just wish it was a tad softer and 2-3 inches longer (extending further down into the tub), tapering in width and thickness."
2,Not the best design,"I echo all of the previous reviewer's (Josh) comments on the headset. It fits too loosely, too easy to push the multi-function button which as way too many functions. The one thing that I really wish that I had considered is the no car charger problem. This is prohibitive. The charger is cool, but highly impractical. I'm walking around with this giant display box in my bag if I want to take the charger with me to work. The sound is good, and it feels relatively comfortable once you get it in place, but the other features leave much to be desired. Definitely 2 stars."
3,Ouch! Is this body brushing or body scraping?,"I'm new to body brushing (dry brushing to stimulate lymph nodes head to toe). Never used one before so I was not sure what to expect other than firm, soft bristles.When I received this item, the bristles were stiff and not soft at all. In fact, it felt like sandpaper! Ouch!By all means, I do not have sensitive skin. Is this how body brushing supposed to be or is there some sort of 'break in' period I should know about? My skin can't take the stiffness even at light brushing. Something tells me this body brush is not supposed to be like this.To give you an idea of how stiff these bristles are, I can confidently clean grout stains with this (by comparison to my actual grout cleaning brush with plastic bristles)."
5,used this skin brush for 20 years,"I found this skin brush many years ago (at least 20) and after trying every other kind of skin brush out there as well, I always return to this one. It is inexpensive and simply the best for dry skin brushing. How nice to have a simple, quality tool that doesn't cost much and does an excellent job at what it says it does! Inspiring!"
3,YOW!,"Works great on your feet and knees and elbows, but yowza, those bristles are too stiff for me to use elsewhere! They are too stiff to lather body wash, too."
3,It's ok.,"I wanted a really sturdy stiff bristled brush, this one is ok, i would say it is a medium textured bristle but not firm enough for a spa quality exfoliation. I bought one at bdy shp a year ago for double the price and it was double the quality was hoping this would compare. It doesn't. I'm using it but it will wear out soon, it is already losing it'd umphf."
3,Spend some time in Renaissance Belgium,"Rucker builds a series of chapters around particular paintings by Bruegel, in order to produce a biographical novel that is well-informed concerning the (known) historical details of Bruegel's life and the political and cultural history of the day. The book offers a good way to get engaged with the period and with the paintings. The writing is a bit clunky, and the novel works more because of the inherent interest of the artist and the period than by what the writer contributes. I could easily have put the book down had other things been available, but as it was it served as a welcome companion during a day of many, many delayed flights and long layovers as I flew across the US."
1,Scavengers on Amazon.com,"I see that Toy Scavengers are continuing to surface on Amazon.com. Selling an action figure for 20 bucks that costed you 3 dollars? Go to Ebay with your rip-off schemes, idiot. You have no place here."
3,"could have been better, could have been worse.","I'm always ambivalent about biographies written while the subject is still alive; you're reading a book with the last chapter missing. Still, Theodore Taylor has done a pretty good job of introducing us to the terrific Jule Styne. The book moves along at a fast clip, gives us plenty of interesting anecdotes, and is a pleasant read. The technique of quoting Styne in italics is a little hokey, and distances us from him somewhat; one wishes for more of a ""first person"" feel. Seems we never get to really know Styne. Had this book been double the length, with twice the detail, we would have a real winner. Having said all that, I still enjoyed the life and times of Jule Styne. Worth a look.And if you are a Sinatra fan, especially recommended, as Styne wrote of some the best stuff FAS ever sang."
3,Everything's Coming Up Roses,"Jule Styne, born Julius Stein, had an incredible life [one for the movies?]: born in London; sang with Harry Lauder at the age of 4; was an early piano prodigy; led his own dance band in Chicago, mixing with the likes of Al Capone; coached stars [the likes of Shirley Temple & Alice Faye] in Hollywood; wrote the music for several hit Broadway shows [""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", ""Gypsy"", ""Funny Girl"", etc.]; a lifelong compulsive gambler.Taylor has done extensive research [for a book now 30 years old; I'm sure there is more available now], and includes many quotes from Styne himself. His writing style, unfortunately, is a little flat. Where is the sparkle of the champagne bubbles that such a life, lived in such a milieu, should reflect? We need some ""Stynese""!"
2,Regrettable,"An interesting effort by a distant, if not vague relation to an historically insignificant figure, albeit one from whom myths form with their customary accuracy. What bits of research and experience are fairly presented are harmed, in my view to no benefit, by gratuitous asides regarding her apparently long-suffering companion, family and (soon to be former?) friends. One must wonder what would have been the book had the author not worked for a newspaper, which one might suspect arranged its serialization gratis. The photos beg for the book guillotine."
5,joy to the world-baroque christmas,"ive had this set for over 10 years, and this is my favorite from a set of 4. i used it too much in the car and it became scrarched, and making copies wasnt possible then. i ordered 2 of these: one to make copies to listen to, and keep original fresh, the 2nd is shelved safely away in case of another crisis of notbeing able to hear it again clearly."
1,Little Bits of Pasta...,DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT. I received a case of boxes of broken little spaghetti bits. It has been very frustrating trying to cook individual portions or anything less than a full box because of the uneven fragments and the way they mix together - you also end up with tons of tiny little pieces all over the place. TERRIBLE.
4,Funny!!!,"Mark Lowry is such a great comedian. He blends real life with comedy seamlessly. He also teaches about The Lord which is great. This DVD is recommended for all ages, believers and non-believers."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"Works great on silver! My hands got black a bit from using it for a while, so if you don't want to get dirty using it, you have to be a bit careful, or wear rubber gloves."
2,didn't really like it,"Ordered two of these, one for myself and one as a gift. I tried mine out right away on a silver piece which sets out and can say that I really didn't care for it. You could see black on the cloth so it got some tarnish off, but if you want a polished shine you'll need a different cloth. I reordered a second product called ""Jewelry Care Cloth"" which has two parts sewn together, I have used that in the past with good results, however the one I reordered appears to be a darker blue color so I'll try and write a review for that to let you know if I like it as the old one. I generally hand polish my silver with Wrights Silver Cream, but these types of clothes are great for a quick shine. I just love the look of freshly polished silver, my family thinks I'm a bit of a fanatic about it."
5,good product,"I am a jeweler and use this type of thing a lot. This is recommended for use with Argentium silver, which is why I bought it."
4,DK picture rich,This is a visual guide. It hits the highlights of many historical eras. I bought it for my 10-year-old daughter. She likes it very much.
1,item not decribed correctly,"This item is not described correctly it only has 3 mounting holes and the overall size is smaller. I am trying replace some existing diffusers and thought from the description that I was getting exactly what I needed, WRONG. To top it off I am being charged a 10% restocking fee and shipping both ways, which is almost what the items cost me minus shipping. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR DESCRIPTION THIS IS VERY MISLEADING!"
4,"Works well, but has some concerns","The skewers are flat, but not wide enough. Some foods (like tomatoes) will still spin.The rack is not ""deep"" enough. Any food chunks over an inch, will sit on the grill, not the holder.Otherwise, it works well."
2,Weak heater for the wattage consumed,"Weak heater considering the 1500 watts it consumes. The flat mica panel doesn't radiate any heat and heat convection is poor. IMO it's a poor design. The Bionnaire works much better with its three angled panels. It puts out at least as much heat as an oil filled heater at full blast.That said, I am still waiting for a well designed mica heater. There is no reason these companis can't design these heaters better, using less current."
2,Loud Clicking,"If you're a light sleeper, this will not work.Yeah the heater itself is quiet but cycles on/ off with a super annoying click. It doesn't help that my room is drafty and temps fluctuate all the time.Great I know it's working and it's keeping me awake or plain distracting.That digital green light is bright at night, I just put tape over it. The remote has a loud digital beep.Solution, maybe get the model without remote? Or just put on a super heavy blanket where you wake up all sweaty in the middle of the night. Beats waking up a dozen times because of this falsely advertised ""quiet"" thing."
3,Too loud to sleep,Wouldn't recommend this product if you're planning on having it in your bedroom or where you plan to sleep. It's loud when it comes on. It works fine otherwise. I keep it at 66 in my livingroom on very cold nights which is 18' x 12' and it keeps it warm. I am disappointed that it didn't work for my bedroom.
2,It worked really well last year!,"For cold season year one, this was the perfect little heater to use in my office. I was in love with this heater. It fit the requirements for safety at my workplace (only radiant heat allowed, nothing that can be seen glowing and no fan). It heated up quickly and warmed a goodly-sized area around it, as well. It was just the right size for rolling it up close to combat a sudden chill. It kept the chill from my huge office window from constantly gliding down my back. I would have given it five stars last year; however, I just now tried to use it, because my office was 61 F this morning. It came on, beeped, the display went dark, and I now have an over-sized $50 paperweight. No, it didn't trip a circuit breaker, the thing is just dead. What a disappointment. It gets one extra star for its great service last year, but this year I'm going to have to look for a more long-term dependable model."
2,Make sudden noises,"The main reason I bought this heater over the heaters with fans was to have no noise so it would be quiet while I slept. The heater was quiet most of the time, but then every once in a while (say once an hour), it would make a loud cracking noise. My guess is while it heated up, the metal on a part expanded and then moved and made this noise. I could not see what was making the noise, since it is all encased. This is very distracting if you are trying to sleep and actually woke me up from my sleep (though I am a light sleeper). If you are not using this while sleeping, it may work just fine. I did not have any issues with a smell like other reviewers. There was a slight smell the first time I used it. Everything else worked fine other than the noise. This may have just been a defect in my unit.I sent it back to amazon and received a full refund, including shipping, no questions asked. I bought a regular heater with a fan and I find that much less distracting when I am sleeping."
3,"It's OK, but...","Was delivered in a timely manner and very easy to assemble. Very little required. Works fine, but not really up to expectations. Haven't tried the remote. Will heat up a small room fairly well, but take quite a bit of time for larger areas. Reasonably happy with the purchase...pete"
3,space heater,"some parts missingcustomer service was adequatethey forwarded the missing parts in reasonable time frameinstructions seemed skewed, tools needed"
1,Quit Working After 3 Months,Worked great for 3 months then just stopped working! only used about 30 times no more than an hour or so per day.
5,A good product,"Easy to operate, efficent, effective and noisless. A good product. The remote control makes it a lot easier to control the system. It's light weigh is also a plus."
2,Good for one season,"Bought this thing in the winter of 2011. It worked very well for the first year. No real complaints. It warmed our smallish bedrooms from approximately 55 degrees to 70 degrees in a couple of hours. Not a lot of noise, and no complaints about smells. Set the thermostat for X degrees, and it keeps the room at X degrees. Nice.Next winter, the thing just stopped working. I see little tiny sparks at the base as it tried to fire up for a few days, then not even a spark. Doesn't matter the settings - it's dead.Piece of dung. Don't buy it unless you only want it for one season."
3,soleus heater,"I bought this heater recently.Pros-Compact size. Light and easy to carry.-Good for heating up a middle sized room. (The heater works).-Inclusion of a remote control.Cons-The first time you turn this heater on, it produces a very strong odor. The subsequent times you turn this heater on, the odor is not as strong as the first time, but is still consistently present.-The control panel is a little too small, and makes navigation less comfortable.As of now, it is still working."
1,Smelly,This thing is smelly. I ran it on high for two days to see if the vapors would get better. It only got a little better. It still has a very toxic chemical smell. Back to the store with it.
4,Micathermic Heater,"Uses more Electric to operate than I expected but is cheaper than LP gas. Great for smaller mobile homes,i.e. single-wides. Quiet as advertised. Consumers must shop for the best price as its priced $150-$70 at various sites. Got best price at Amazon."
1,Waste of money,"This heater seemed, at first, a good buy. Then after ten days or so, it just stopped heating, stone cold. When I called customer server, they said there was nothing they could do, so we took it back and bought an electric stove: much, much better, warmer and more dependable. The Soleus heater is cheaply made in China; don't waste your time and money."
5,great bathroom heater,easy to use-like the remote to turn on. Room gets very warm very fast. There is no fan to make you feel cold
2,no good piece of heat,"I needed a heater to warm me up. This thing warms up but not me. It is rated at 1500watt or whatever but all it does is send the heat up to the ceiling which is of no use to me. Yes, you may say that it will eventually warm up the room but its been 6 hours and I'm still cold. I decided to put it under my desk and it is now warming me up. The size of it would probably fool you, leading you to believe it will warm anything bigger than the underside of a desk but it barely does at the highest setting. I dont' know if it is safe to place it where I have it but I figure my chair probably gets warmer than my desk will with this darned thing. I suggest you either get a spot heater (I'm buying this tomorrow-Soleus Air MS-09 Oscillating Radiant Heater) or a forced air kind of heater you can keep next to you. These radiator things don't work! Not only do they take for ever to warm a room they suck when they do warm anything up."
2,disappointed,"The good thing about this product is that it is quiet. The disappointments are (one is silly) - the power up sounds like a smoke alarm when the battery needs replacing and it scares my dog! - but more importantly, it really does not work for me. Maybe it works better in a closed room, but I have open connecting rooms and the only time it helps is if I am sitting right next to it! - sort of like a fireplace without the soot - or atmosphere! Actually bought two of them after reading reviews. Now sort of stuck."
4,good product,"this heater was purchased for a college kid. according to her it works wonderfully, however it uses a lot of enegy. do not run it on hi. it tends to trip the ciruit breaker!"
1,Shoddy assembly,"Recieved the Soleus Air HM2-15R-32 Flat Panel Micathermic Heater with Remote that I ordered and found that it was packged without all the parts required for assembly. Contacted the manufacturer and was told that relacement parts would be shipped out but not to expect them for four or five business days. Since I had already paid for the unit and the problem was of their making, I asked if they would ""overnight"" the parts to me. Was told that they do not do this. I very seldom write reviews unless I feel that the public is being wronged. I will follow up on this review when/if I get the parts."
1,Save your money - DO NOT BUY,"I have the HGW model Soleus micathermic heater - similar, and from the same company.First unit - dead after 6 months (lights come on - no heat)replacement - huge dent in back panel on arrival (box perfect... they sent it that way!)second replacement - OK for a few months. Tried it as the weather got colder this month. Worked once, now won't heat up.Customer service says the warranty starts (and ends) based on the original purchase date, so I'm out of luck.AVOID THIS COMPANY"
2,Didn't last a week...,A friend recommended this heater. I got one. Mine didn't make it through the first week: odd sounds and a small brown burn mark were visible after the first few days. I returned it.
2,not as advertised,"does not heat above 80,very slow and does not heat a 12 x12 room takes hours not recommend i returnd heater"
5,Great heater - no problems,"This provides a really even heat to our large, high ceilinged family room. We have a wood burning stove elsewhere in the house, and though it adds some warmth to our family room, we have never been able to get the chill out of the air. Using this heater as an additional heat source works really well. It never gets too hot to the touch, and I feel it is safe to let my two children play around it."
3,Dirty Pictures,"An interesting perspective on ""What Is"" art and free speech. While I may or may not agree with the photographs depicted and do not know how historically accurate the movie is, it does give pause for thought on ones views of the constitution and community standards."
4,It's good and kids like it. But not exceptional,Video quality okay. Performance were good. But these days with youtube and america has talent etc it's very hard to impress kids. So good but not exceptional
4,awesome movie,very good movie who ever likes music and willing to take the time enjoying with family to watch ithas a little comedy to the movie.i loved it a lot
5,Noise,The most incredible dvd I everr bought. I ha ve watched it two times already and would love to see it on broadway. The best purches I nhave made in a long time.
2,Beware!!! NO Surround Sound!!!!,"I love Stomp. The image quality is excellent.But beware!!! This DVD IS NOT IN SURROUND SOUND!!!!!!!!!!As impossible as it sounds, this Bluray is recorded in ""Dolby STEREO"". So all that you are going to get is the use of your 3 front speakers and, depending of your sound receiver, a simulated effect on the rear speakers.Fist of all, Stomp is a show of SOUND and for me is incredible that in 2009 a bluray comes with less that surround sound.Again, I love Stomp. I have also the ""Stomp Out Loud"" and the difference in sound is impressive. That's why I giving only 2 stars.The show is worth a 6 stars! Sorry."
3,Quick/Easy/Fun art ideas for parents or teachers,"The ideas for art projects here really do take about five minutes to prepare, which is a blessing if you've ever spent more time setting up an art project than a child actually spent doing it! Many of the projects are original, some are fresh variations of more familiar techniques. This is a good reference for teachers, parents, and anyone who works with children, especially at this price. Another good point about the ideas is that they are easily adaptable for a wide variety of ages, from preschool to elementary age children. Good for rainy days activities, birthday parties or presents, and any day you need a quick, easy, and fun art project that turns out well."
5,These tours were the highlight of our trip,Our family loved these tours! We had originally planned to do 2 or 3 of them but ended up doing them all because it became very clear that there is no better way to see this city. They are so simple and easy to follow that we let each of our kids play Tour Guide For A Day. And we loved the convenience of bringing only the foldout for that day's tour instead of lugging around heavy guidebooks. Worth every penny!
1,Save your money!,"At $15.95, this is an outrageous rip-off! The impressive-looking cover image looks like a book, but it only an envelope which contains five LEAFLETS! They look like the attraction-folders one sees around to be picked up for free. While the maps are clear, the points of interest listed are described in a few words or short sentences. You'll get abundantly more information with a book of guided walks. Don't get suckered in to this excessive price."
5,Sparkles!,I love the design works great with my anniversary band.I have small hands so the combination does not overpower.The price is right too.thank you for such a beautiful ring.
5,The Girl From Poor House Lane,"Great book - so many interesting characters, & stories within a story. Am rapidly becoming a Freda Lightfoot fan."
5,Awesome figure:,The figure arrived very fast. My son absolutely loves it! It is a perfect for my Curt Schilling fan son.
5,A Maya book worth owning!!,This little book is a worth while addition to any Maya users desktop library. It contains a collection of tips that might take hours upon hours of probing the tool set to discover. Some of the tips included in the book could save a great deal of time as well as ease the headaches associated with the everyday use of a tool as complex as Maya. I have no problems recommending this book to both beginner and experienced Maya users alike.
5,Worth more then it cost...,"I could not more highly recommend a book then this one, ""Maya 5 Killer Tips."" It truly is a killer book. I am very new to Maya, but with this book I have been able to work with some of the more powerful features of Maya 5 with greater ease thanks to this book. It is books like this one that greatly shortens the learning curve of powerful programs like Maya as well as enabling new users to enjoy the learning process at the same time. For the price of admission for two to a movie and a couple soft drinks you can have this excellent book."
5,Typical Kreg - Great Quality,"These worked great for a speaker building project using 1/2"" plywood. I did not plug the holes, so 1"" were the perfect length (if you are plugging, get the 3/4"").I was using the Micro Drill Guide for this project.On the first hole, if the material was not clamped, the screw tended to jack the materials apart. A quick back out and reset of the screw always fixed the problem."
2,Amanda's Review,"Paul is not very happy for the choices he made so know he has to go live on the Vallenport Farm for the rest of the summer. While he is there he meets a very strange dog named Einstien. He also meets a great friend named Rebacca. Along the way he meets some good people and some bad. When Paul asks people about Einstien's old owner way does every one get upset about it? When a friend finally tells Paul that Einstien's old owner is died, he trys to connect with him."
5,Nice Book,This is a nice book. It tells a story that makes history come alive; the book includes nicely written sections on interesting facts related to life during Revolutionary War times.
2,JP,I installed this for my Impala 2005 and it worked out fine at first and it fits perfectly it is also very easy to install...However now that its been a few months its making a subtle but noticable noise...I didn't expect this out of a new fan..If it gets any louder I'm going to have to replace it which is a great disappointment.
2,A hundred unnecessary pages,"This is the first book Bugliosi has written that I did not enjoy reading. His basic thesis is sound and would have been fine for a magazine article, but he goes way off the subject and rambles incessantly. His ego has reached immense proprtions; he can't stop talking about how brilliant he is and how stupid everyone else is. There are too many ad hominem attacks and irrelevant analogies that have nothing to do with the book's main subject ( I still don't understand what the Florida Marlins, Kevin Garnett, and Ivan Lendl have to do with the book's critique of the Court)."
4,A correct but blunt and harsh critique of the Court's error.,"Like Outrage, Vincent Bugliosi prosecutes the Court for its blunder in Jones v. Clinton. But this is not the first time the Court has issued horrible and unsupportable decisions, something which the author ignores. Vincent's timing, however, was perfect as the book came out January 15 before the Lewinsky and Ginsburg became household names Overall, a very good book that needed another draft and editing. As Mark Twain said: There is no such thing as good writing only good rewriting, or something like that!"
3,Stop the insanity!,"Not one of Bugliosi's best works, but a true representative sample of a man who does his homework and backs up everything he says with ample evidence. The man knows what he's talking about, and he knows what is happening to this country and the office of the Presidency with the ludicrous antics of the Independent Prosecutor.Understanding the concept of ""balance of interests"" of Paula Jones v. the National interest alone was worth the price of the book ... because it helped me to put my finger on why I have felt so violated by the process as a citizen of the United States. We have the right to a President who can focus on the work we elected him to do. If he found himself rather confused about the connection between sex and violence ... that's one of the major drawbacks of the country we live in, and the people he represents. Clinton is not the problem. He just makes it visible."
2,What a windbag!!!,"I happen to agree with Mr. Bugliosi that the Supreme Court made a huge blunder in this case. I agree that postponing Ms. Jones' suit until after the end of Clinton's term would have been the most acceptable route. Clinton (and no other president) would ever be ""above the law"" with this approach. Paula Jones would still have had her day in court. I rather doubt that she and her handlers would care once Clinton is no longer president. That said, this book is a BIG disappointment. Mr. Bugliosi rambles on for much of the book about totally unrelated topics---girls wearing jeans and navel jewelry come to mind. He even shamelssly promotes his OJ book. He arrogantly promotes himself as the only one who noticed the Court's blunder (some of the rest of us noticed, too). Without the ridiculous diatribes and self promotions, the author would have had a very slim book. I also think that he likes to rant and hear the sound of his own voice."
1,Elitist and Foolish Book...,"The only merit of this otherwise elitist and foolish book is that one can learn how *trial* lawyers can distort issues beyond all recognition (""above the law"") and how they employ such tactics as grossly inappropriate analogies (Hitler for the Suprem Court), (weak) strawman counterarguments, non sequiturs (e.g. Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act of 1940 and the President's responsibilities), and so on, and how they can represent themselves as something they are not (neutral, non-partisan). One can also see that it is possible to expand a one-paragraph argument into a book --- although this is admittedly a lousy example."
2,Poorly veiled partisan deceit,"Our country is in the current unfortunate state of social decay due to men like Vincent Bugliosi who blur and blunt the truth, then fail to see the causal behaviour creating the outcomes in this case of a man named Bill Clinton. No one, including the Supreme Court, suffers a liar well, and in this case the Supreme Court has the capability to bring to bear at least a small amount of justice by allowing the prosecution of the liar, though he is the President. Bugliosi's treatise is poorly-veiled partisan deceit. Many American people have turned their faces from the Presidency and Bill Clinton because of the previous behaviour of Mr. Clinton and his ongoing exploits in office. Clinton's actions are a dishonor and disgrace to our country and our people. He currently stands as one of the most disingenuous, female-exploiting politicians of the modern era. As a past prosecutor, how can Bugliosi remotely support the type activities in which Mr. Clinton engages? Jim Street."
1,was expecting something different,"I was expecting a Waldorf inspired book with information about seasonal celebrations and pagan holidays, but this book actually is only interested in obscure Christian holidays. The text in general is very evangelical in nature and assumes that its reader is fairly evangelical as well. Some of the crafts are cute but equally good craft ideas can be found in other, less Christianity focused, books. Again, I repeat, this is not really a Waldorf book. Buyer be warned. It has nothing to do with paganism or green living or non-Christianity based homeschooling or natural family living, as the tags say that it does, unless for you natural family living and evangelical Christianity are the same."
4,Better than I Thought at First,"I've owned this book for about a year now and I had to change my review. At first I was going to return the book but I decided to keep it when I noticed how often I refer to it for seasonal ideas. I don't often make projects directly from the book, but I usually get some good starter ideas. If I had to choose one Waldorf-y style book, however, I would choose Earthways by Carol Petrash."
3,Learning How to Blend,"This book is simply written and an easy read. We are raising our children according to scripture and I love how she pulls out words from God in order to make this work. We have had a very hard blending five children and the minute I feel things get a little hectic, I refer to the book.I started with other books and put them down and immediately put out a note on FB asking for a book that could really help and more than one response directed me to this book.Its a great start."
5,Blended Families book = HARMONY!,"I found this book to be absolutly amazing. I would recommend this book to any blended family, as it has given my (used to be) blended family quality. I found it to be more than just a book; it has given my family the tools and understanding beyond what I expected. I also love that it is bible based; it was the icing on the cake. After concluding we are a solid unit now (after 5 years of just being together - we have married), rather than a couple with seperate households. If I could give this book 10 stars I would!If you currently have a blended family; It would be a great blessing to your family to purchase this book along with the workbook. Perfect for beginning a blended families ministry."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"A fictional biography of Henry James, this masterpiece truly deserves being hailed by The New York Times as one of the five best novels of 2004.Anyone who loves Henry James will find this book an enriching, engrossing portrait that combines the pace, plot and psychological insights of a novel filled with the thoroughly researched facts of James' colorful life.A must read for anyone who loves good literature, Henry James, and who wants insights into how a writer achieves great art.When I finished this book, which lingers with you, I wanted nothing more than to visit James' cosy and comfortable home in the countryside of England that he loved so much and that Colm evokes with such splendour."
4,"Beautiful, but Slow","To start, I know almost nothing of Henry James. For me the novel worked as a beautiful character study with some absolutely haunting and stunning scenes. Toibin is a great writer.And yet the book took me six weeks to finish. Though each chapter was wonderful, there was a such a total lack of forward momentum that I rarely felt compelled to continue. I made myself finish, out of respect for the author."
3,"fantastic writing, but somehow the story is not engaging","While I was fascinated and drawn in by this marvelous writer's amazing wordcraft, I ended this book feeling empty and disaappointed. Perhaps if one had an active and rich knowledge of Henry James' life this book would bring one to some new places, but alas, I do not...and so, I was not inspired by the story. The press and the critics seem to have already decided this is a Booker Prize winner, and the writing merits that kind of attention...but truthfully the story did not bring me anyplace I hadn't been before."
5,A Good Look at the Life Of Henry James.,"Although the book didn't go into detail in some aspects of Mr. James' life, it did shine a light to let us see what type of person the famous author was and how he used his personality to write such hit books. The fact that he takes his friends for granted, at times, until they are no longer there, made me feel a little on the edge. But his incorporating some of their characteristics into his books made me appreciate such a man. I had read Mr. James' and Mr. Moore's, ""The Portrait Of A Lady"", last year and feel it, along with his own life, will always be sought-after material. Interesting material that was put in an attentive form by Mr. Toibin! I am including this book, along with ""The Portrait Of A Lady"" in my ""So You'd Like To ... Dip Into Some Great Books- Go Ahead And Dive!"""
5,good job,Great service and the book was in as good as shape as indicated. Got before promised. Will look for user when ordering books.
2,Henry James imagined,"This book is not nearly as good as anything written by Henry James himself. It is a novel about Henry James covering this mature years in London and Rye. This NOVEL--what does the author mean!?-- main characters are based on real people and named for the people they are based on, but because it is called a novel I suppose one cannot complain if you don't like it or some portrayal of the characters.Henry James crawls achingly through the book mostly as a depressive personality. I don't believe it. Near the end there a scene where Henry's brother, William, tells him he has been in contact with their dead mother. Toibin has Henry respond, ""...Is my mother at rest?"" Now would you respond to your brother and refer to your mother as if your brother had not the same mother?"
5,obviously a five star.,"A whole troupe of modern authors claim a debt to Henry James but they've had at least the good sense to make their own work readable, which is more than could ever be said for the man himself. Toibin's well honed and manicured prose is a clear scion of this evergreen source. It's hard to choose between this one and David Lodge's marvellous novel ""Author,author"" so it's probably best to read and enjoy both."
3,Overwrought,"Toibin is a wonderful writer. My favorite book of his is The South. Unfortunately I found this novel (about five years in the life of Henry James) to be a little overwrought and at times bordering on pretentious. It seems self-consciously literary. One can almost feel the writer straining at the bit. There are some wonderful moments -- an amazing scene where James throws a friend's dresses in a canal (based on a true story). What is also annoying is that Toibin's dialogue is not consistent -- after reading the novel I went to the five-volume biography to see where Toibin had gotten his images. At times Toibin uses the literal words of James', at other times (when the dialogue is best) it is invented. I feel that I have not sung Toibin enough. He, along with McCann and McGahern, is among the best of Irish writers. Anyone interested in craft and beauty should read his work."
4,It left me thinking,"Toibin captured the heart and soul of Henry James. I read this because I am a fan of the works of Henry James and felt that I was given a glimpse into the mind of the author. Toibin does this well, making me feel that even though I am reading fiction, I am getting an idea of the true thoughts and feelings of James. This book is truly sad. Toibin's James lives life as an observer. He realizes too late that he observes a bit too much and did not live life to its fullest."
3,"Elaborate prose, dull story","This is one of the most beautifully written contemporary novels I have read in a long time, that is if I were merely concentrating on the sentence structure and the phrases used by the author rather than the story he was attempting to tell. I was really looking forward to reading this novel, given the praise from professional and amateur reviewers I read before purchasing it. Unfortunately, the elaborate prose lacks substance, and despite my best efforts to enjoy this prize-winning novel, I found it nearly impossible to become engrossed. I generally enjoy novels that are beautifully descriptive and don't feel the need to have a succinct ending, but despite my best efforts, and my appreciation for Henry James novels, I could not bring myself to truly enjoy this one."
2,...,"I somewhat had to force myself to finish the book. In retrospective it was an interesting subject to read about Henry James' life, but I found the writing not on part and the story a bit forced."
1,Why do we need this book?,"There is little interesting in this book that I could see. I didnt finish it. It was a big tease about whether or not Henry James is going to have sex with a man. Since he didnt get an e_____n when he slept in a trundel bed naked with Oliver Wendel Holmes, he might not be gay. But he must appear gay because a society lady thinks she is doing him a favor when she assigns a toothsome gay butler to him when he spends time at her houses. Like who cares if he is gay or not? That's the main topic of the first quarter of the book. We get to meet his pathetic sister before she dies."
5,Great for beginners,"This book is an excellent guide for beginners, spelling out CBT techniques clearly and in a practical way for each disorder. Treatment plans are easy to follow. CD with extra information is brilliant with many useful client handouts."
5,Excellent resource for new psychologists!,"I'm a PhD candidate (clinical psych) and got this book based on a friend's recommendation. It is super helpful. It has brief sample case conceptualizations (mainly CBT, but other modalities when appropriate) and step by step treatment plans for different depression and anxiety disorders. It also has worksheets and a CD so you can print and use them whenever you want. It's easy reading, but not just fluff. Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a CBT treatment guide."
5,Excellent Product,"The product specifications are exactly as described - this is an actual Philips #000 screwdriver. The picture is an exact match to the product I received.I've used a Husky branded set which claimed to have a #000 screwdriver head, but it wasn't a real #000 - this one is. This fit the correct screw size perfectly, was an easy fit, and didn't result in any screw or driver head stripping. The red knob on the back of the screwdriver is a functional rotating cap for added comfort. I have noticed no signs of wear thus far.I can't think of any reasonable way to criticize this product. This is an excellent product, it works perfectly, I am very satisfied with it, and would recommend it to others."
5,This is the one to clean the dust out of your Canon 17-55/2.8 EF-S lens,Very solid piece of hardware. Perfectly fits the three phillips head screws you need to take out in order to remove the front element from your Canon 17-55/2.8 lens. Very easy do-it-yourself cleaning. Mine was LOADED full of dust. Now it looks factory new and still shoots perfectly.
1,Advertisements with little articles,I was very disappointed with this magazine. It has more advertisements than articles. Each issue has full page ads and maybe a very articles. Not worth the money. They should pay you for it.
1,East Coast Advertising,"Subscription service extremely slow to process order. I've received one issue of New England Home, and 6 Architectural Digest and both were ordered 5 months ago. New England was full of advertisement and lacked substance, not worth the wait."
1,CL-41 cartridges not recognized by printer at all,Even remanufactured cartridges should work. Tried both CL-41s with my Canon MP210 and they are not recognized. Printer keeps saying that cartridges do not work and there is no way to print at all.
2,Unreliable,The ink warning lights on my printer are always on after putting in the cartridges. This is explained and I can live with that. But after a couple of weeks the color cartridge failed completely. Printer model MP210.
2,Not for my printer,I had to return these cartridges. the description said they were compatible with my printer but they were not. I was very disappointed
3,remanufactured ink cartridges,Get pop ups that the ink is out - have to remove the cartridge - shake it and reinstall and then it will print a while and do the same thing. Price is good and I will deal with this to save money.
1,Out already?,"I purchased these ink cartridges on October 9th and received them in mid-October, 2012. It is now December 4th and I already am receiving a low/no ink signal on my printer. Ink from Canon tends to last me ~6 months. This brand barely lasted 2 months.Maybe its time to switch to laser..."
3,Okay,"Remanufactured ink cartridges are okay. I do not like the fact that when you install the cartridge you receive a message that says the ink may have run out. The function for detecting the remaining ink level is disabled since the ink level cannot be correctly detected. In order to continue printing without this function, you have to press the printer's Stop/Reset button. I still don't know when I'm close to running out of ink. I guess I'll find out. Don't think I'll buy remanufactured ink cartridges again"
3,Decent for the Price,"I have been using my ink cartridges for a few weeks now. Print quality is just okay because there is definitely a fair amount of smearing/smudging that I have never had with Canon's ""official"" ink cartridges. I can use for everyday printing, but I definitely won't use for high quality printing such as photos, business documents, resumes, etc. But still, considering the price, I think it is a decent deal."
2,Disappointed--hoping for more,"I found that the remanufactured ink cartridges do not last very long, I just put cartridges in and already needing to replace.So the price was good and I should have known there was a down side...Buy knowing that cartridges have a short shelf life...also my printer continues to read low on ink-I override and print-however-as I found out it will be low on ink fast--for realNo, problem with the print quality..."
2,Wouldn't buy it again!,"My daughter recieved this as a birthday gift. First off it is tiny, much smaller than it appears in the pictures. Second all of the toys are supposed to store inside...they don't! Beast does not fit in the tower he is supposed to. My daughter likes to play withit but, everytime she opens a door the door falls off so she has to find me to fix it. The characters are hard to put in the slots they are supposed to fit in. ..."
3,falls apart easily,My 5 yr old got this toy for her b-day. It doesn't stay together very good. It's almost impossible to get the beast into the notch to dance with Belle. Get this toy on sale if it's a must-have!!
2,Ugh! Can they make the toys any worse?,"My two and a half year old loves Beauty and the Beast ever since the re-release of the movie on DVD. I have bought her almost all the princess items, and this item makes the top 5 in worst made so far. What is the point of the towers if the figures don't fit in it? Um, the doors fall off and my daughter gets mad and cries. She screams ""MOMMY BROKEN""......She tries to simulate the entire story with this toy and sings ""Be Our Guest""...which is great... but this toy is one that should have been brought to quality control before they invited the public to purchase it."
5,Extremely useful,"I was in the pro shop of the local bowling alley when the Ebonite rep was there. Since I have an Ebonite ball (older) I asked about the way it was performing...did I need a new one? Did I need to re-drill the finger holes? His answer: Try this tape over your thumb area...pull it on like pantyhose...stick it on your fingernail and stretch it a bit up over your knuckle. It will tighten up the thumb hole and give you more control, but also an easy release. I am about to order my 4th roll. Love the stuff. Best thing about it is that in the winter I use a double strip, and in the summer only a single strip 'cause fingers swell a bit in heat and/or humidity. Great ""fix"" for some of those thumb-fitter problems. I am an average+ (female) bowler who loves the game. Everyone around me was putting tapes into the bowling ball hole. This works MUCH better for me, and I don't have to worry about the in-ball tapes getting gunky after time!"
3,Stains easily,I am doing a baking class and needed pans so i ordered two sets of these pans however they stain easying. i still enjoy wilton pans but this set stains does not come out.
2,Warping?,"Not very impressed with this set. Pretty nice, until you use them. I sometimes use the cookie sheet to bake chicken thighs. If the sheet isn't full of thighs, it warps while baking. Sometimes enough to spill chicken juice to the bottom of the oven. I'm probably not supposed to cook chicken thighs on a cookie sheet, but I have always in the past without warping."
5,best workout I know,"Some workouts are too brutally difficult for someone over 65 and not especially fit, but this one, with practice, I have learned to do and I find it terrific. This really pushes me to my limit, and leaves me feeling that I have started the day right."
5,The WORKOUT- I love it!,"Today was my 1st day doing this workout. It has 3 levels; I completed level one, and I thought it was great. It wasn't too overwhelming and I look forward to moving up in levels. Plus, it was a bonus to see people from the show on the DVD. If you are just now deciding you want a change, then this is the workout for you."
3,Decent Workout,"We have been getting really into workout videos at my house, and we recently purchased this thinking it would be a good hard workout. We read the descriptions of each level and decided to skip right to level 3. It was still too easy for us, so we just amped up our own level of intensity to increase heart rate and such. It is a great tape for those of you just starting off, but if you are in semi okay shape I would only recommend if you can make yourself work harder than they do in the video. I won't lie I was sore the next day, but I feel like I wouldn't have been if I was working at the intensity they were on the video. The good thing is it offers low impact for people with bad knees, and it also offers variations of intensity for beginningers and such. I will do the workout again, but at my own pace, and now if I have a friend who is just beginning they will be able to keep up on their own with the tape as well."
5,Fabulous! Realistic for Bigger people!,"I am almost 300lbs., and this video is great!! It is realistic for a starting program that you can continue. You feel as though you have really worked out, but it is something you will continue to do. It has 3 levels, the beginning is perfect for someone starting out. I had checked it out at the library, and fell in love. I had to have it!! I have already lost a 2 pant sizes and I've only had it 2 weeks, plus I really do FEEL better. It is completely reasonable, 15 mins to begin with. Chris Powell is amazing, understanding, and very encouraging! I have finally found a workout video that I think I will stick with."
2,It's ok.,"This video is geared for people who are very overweight and/or out of shape. I found it boring and not really a workout at all. I think it would be good if you are very out of shape, but otherwise, it isn't challenging enough."
5,Thanks Chris!,"Aside from Leslie Sansone series I dislike exercise dvds, but I love this show and was happy to see that the host had put out a dvd. Love it! Challenging without overwhelming me. Now to stick with it! Thanks Chris!"
1,Utter garbage,"I bought this book for my 14 year old daughter, thinking that it might give her some insights for today's high school experience. I was expecting a book that dealt with making and keeping new friends, study habits, organization, balancing schoolwork and homelife, etc.What we got was a book that talks about on-line dating, whether or not oral sex is considered sex, 10 questions to ask yourself before having sex, tattoos, genital piercing, and talking back to teachers. The book seems like a compilation of crap from magazines like GL or J-14. They barely give any insights on how to survive high school. The title was very misleading."
2,rather dull,"I recently saw this very same adze at a woodworking supply close by. The clerk and I opened three of these, pulling the wax off the 'cutting edge'.. all three of them were duller than I could imagine. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the adze, it just wasn't worth it.I did look up the pfeil brand adzes. They look more promising."
2,Too thin.,"This earring is just a wisp of a thing. I was hoping for something a little more substantial. Also, the clasp is very delicate."
1,Just doesn't work!,"I purchased one of these from eBay and it wouldn't work on either of my Canon cameras. The flash head itself, with the proper module works fine on my Minolta. I read the two Amazon reviews and went with J's comment that the first reviewer may have gotten a bad unit, that he had no problems, so I went ahead and ordered another one from Amazon. I've just spent an hour, reviewing manuals and camera settings and still end up with the same problem as the first one. Both Canons; Rebel EOS xt and EOS 20D are TTL functional and the product write up states that the module will work on both. I also use speedlights on both of these cameras, as well as my Nikon D3200 with no problems at all, so I know the hot shoe's and TTL's are working. I contacted the eBay seller and asked for suggestions and was told ""don't know, I'm a Nikon man"", end of story there. So, good luck getting it to work if you buy one, but I'm totally done with the project."
1,QDC-CN Module is NOT eTTL-2 compatible,"The Quantaray QDC-CN flash module is NOT compatible with Canon eTTL-2 cameras. It appears to be nothing more than a relabeled QDA-CN module, with some of the wording replaced in the instruction sheet to indicate that it is eTTL-2 compatible. I have now tested it with the original Digital Rebel, the Rebel XT, and the S5-IS - all of which are eTTL-2 cameras. In every case, in every mode, the flash fires only at full strength, which is exactly what Canon describes will happen with incompatible (non-Canon) flashes and is exactly the behavior exhibited by the original QDA-CN module. If Quantaray did, in fact, update the module circuitry, they certainly could not have tested it. This unit is essentially useless."
4,Pretty Decent,"Not a bad buy for the money. I've had the heater about a year; it works well and seems well made. It easily heats my two-car garage (which has a 13 foot ceiling) from 35-40 degrees to comfortable in about 30-45 minutes. I've never actually measured, but my impression is that I go through propane pretty fast. The heater claims a 14-hour burn on a 20# tank - that's probably about right. I wish it had a gas shut-off valve on the heater, as it would be nice to keep the propane outside and not have to run out to shut it off, but that is my only complaint."
4,Ken Perlman's Fingerstyle Guitar,I find the book reasonably useful. Most of the songs were of older artists and not easy to find recordings of. This book would be great if it had an accompanying CD.
2,Total Disappointment,"I was looking for the book, instead I got the short story that the book was developed from. The short story is heroic; the book deals with frailties and doubts, failures and successes."
2,Bait and ?,Selected this book to reread an old favorite. What a waste. It was just getting started and it stopped. I know the story so I was quite amazed when it stopped. Bummer.
5,Geat book....,"I love all the books in this series, the evil Genius alwasy has some interesting and great projects for newbies, to advanced. I would recomend these to anyone who loves DIY projects."
4,As weird as they come....,This movie is extremely suspenseful and extremely weird. It has a lot of imagery and subtle hints that require you to read between the lines to figure out what's happening to Simon (main character). I was on the edge of my seat for the better part of the movie. The ending is one of those where you have to draw some of your own conclusions and kind of leaves you hanging. A great sci-fi thriller with plenty of weirdness to keep you guessing.
3,Only Because of Jeremy!!!,"OK, I gave this movie 3 stars only because Jeremy Sisto!!!! is the main character in this movie. Had it been anyone else, I'd give it a 2 star rating. Sisto plays Simon, a paranoid computer programmer living in an apartment building. One day, a empty package is left at his door.... and then again and again. This really makes Simon extremely paranoid and he has a state of the art security system installed in his apartment. We see strange characters in this film by way of the other tenants. This movie will keep you guessing however it does have it's boring moments but overall, it's a ""different"" movie and worth the rental fee."
2,Silly and Dull,"Silly, dull and writing is at the ""young adult"" level. Only read about half way (not finishing a book is rare for me)."
1,Great Book ... Greedy Publisher,Take back your Kindle. Do not purchase from Macmillan or any other publisher (Penguin and Simon and Schuster and Hachette) that is causing the flourish of high prices and raised prices on ebooks of classics. The Big Time is a fifty year old novella that is priced here at CAN$12.03. This is plainly greed on the part of this publisher looking to cash in on the enthusiasm of Kindle users. ebooks should encourage more reading not less reading and more books being purchased not less.
3,"Strange, yet appealing","As I march my way through all the Hugo & Nebula winners I came upon this book. The only other Lieber works I've read have been the very likable Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser series...a fantasy staple. The Big Time is definately an original piece of time travel fiction, yet there is actually no time travel involved in the book. The prose is light on narrative and very heavy on dialogue. I had little to work with in visualizing the surroundings (basically a large room) in which the characters interacted the entire time. Despite this, I did enjoy it for the most part; although once again I am left a little baffled by the ending (a la Babel-17 by Delany). As someone else pointed out (who I agree with) this book reads like a stage play, and could easily be turned into a strange, yet tense, psuedo-time travel suspense. It's a quick read. If you want to hit all the ""classics"" and can find a copy, go for it. If you're a casual sci-fi reader, I recommend you skip it."
5,full of surprises,"I read recently in an interview with Robert Zemeckis that the modern moviegoer does not like surprises. That is why the preivews today cover all of the major plot points, show all of the best special effects, and tell all of the best jokes.This book is full of unexpected plot twists, so if you are one of those who do not like surprises, skip it. But if you want to read one of the best sf novels ever written, buy it."
1,Zzzzzzzz.....,"I could not finish this very short book. In fact, I only made it halfway. It read like a play, which is not bad for a play. However, all the action takes place off screen and then people come back and talk about it. Perhaps the problem was my expectation. If it were written in play format, I think I would have enjoyed it more, but novels (and novellas) can do anything and are not limited to a group of people standing around talking. This violates the rule every comp teacher drills into their students heads: show don't tell."
2,Just could not finish it,Hat's off to those who could finish this and enjoy it. I forced myself through the first third of the book before accepting that me and this book were not destined for one another.
2,"""Big"" Doesn't Mean A ""Good"" Time","The Big Time suggested such a wonderful, creative idea that it was hard to resist. However, in practice the book was tedious, the characters were not well developed and some of the curiosities Leiber aroused were never fully addressed.As odd as it sounds, the feeling of the book is very much like the setting in Cabaret - a group of people waiting to see how a war is going work out. Even down to the German phrases that are muttered. Was Leiber a fan of musicals?The concept probably makes this worth the read but its a hard book to get through. The 130 pages seem double their length upon reflection."
5,history,a great view into the understanding of a contemporary writer of the period. not an easy read because of the archaic way of writing history.
4,An unforgettable adventure of all times,"Go on an adventure with unbelievable characters in Abadan,to escape the evil vizier,Shugdad.Are Lukases sharp wits sharper then shugdads spears? See in this imaginative book with Nur-Jehan,Kayim,Lukas,Shugdad,and many more.This is a very good book out of all Alexander's marvelous tales."
5,awesome book.,"The first two lives of Lukas-Kasha is one of my favorite books.Its an extremely fun and easy read, and I feel as though I personally met the main character.Lukas is a very plucky person, and the book provides the reader with many laughs.He is magically transported to a different world, and everyone seems to mistake him for royalty.He doesn't know how it happened and he doesn't really care.Lukas doesn't have the slightest clue how to rule a kingdom, but he loves the life of luxury.Hes enjoying life in the slow lane when things start going wrong.People are out to kill him, and he is soon on the run with the few friends he managed to make.Maybe the life of a street rat wasn't so bad after all."
2,Not too good,"This book was very slow going from start to finish. It definitely wasn't Loyd Alexander's best book. Nothing ever happened, when I read the preview on the back of the book I thought it would be good. Then I read it. There must of been one exciting part in the whole story."
4,as described and on time,books were described as new and that is what they were. Printed in 1978 and in off the shelf condition.
3,There is More to Ponder,"After reading The Awful Truth, I pondered if I wanted to be judgmental and write a review. Patrick J. Conway has extensively researched, but not throughly, a controversial compelling theory. Intrigued by his theory, I read provoking peaks of thought and read into discouraging valleys of judgement that was a distraction. I sensed a strong patriarchal bias, a tendency to generalize and to make bold assumptions. As is with many theories, more data points need to be researched and connected. The Awful Truth is extremely impactful and I respect Conway's passion for his belief."
1,"Bogus, lying, wrong","This book is one of the biggest pieces of trash I have ever read. Not one aspect of it is factually correct. It's premise is bogus, and the mental health of the author needs to be called into question if he actually believes this. Please do not waste your money."
3,He said what?,"This is a confusing book. His writing is good and overall the book is easy to follow, but for me, having read many books on the same subject, and having arrived at certain other conclusions, Mr. Conway's theory lacks ""something"" to get me excited and wanting more. His book is full of facts and ideas I can agree with and interpretations which baffle me as he seems to be unaware of much other research. None of us can actually say what happened in various eras of history so we cannot grade his scholarship exactly, but for my money this man misses the mark. He raises one clear question I have not encountered before concerning the period around 70 A.D. and a few others but overall I am unable to go along with him. I would recommend the book to those who study this subject but as a secondary title. I do think this book has value for any bookshelf loaded with similar titles and research."
4,Interesting,This book gives you unrevealed information about history. It is well researched and well written. The results are very controversial but is worth to read.
2,Falling Asleep,"I like my romances with a more zing than Carol Grace wrote. Don't pick up this book expecting to read about sex. There is none of that in this book. Some kissing, but that's as heated as it gets. I wouldn't even say this book had sexual tension. Romance tension, maybe. I would have also liked Grace to delve more into the background of Amanda and Rahman's past. Seemed as if they got over past hurts too easily, especially Amanda."
3,Glock 23 holster,"Arrived fast, pretty comfy around the ankle, does slip a little, and sticks out quite a bit, but not bad for the size of gun. if i wear my regular pants you can't tell unless you knew i was carrying. good quality for the money."
3,Holster good Gun too Big,So I bought this holster hoping that it would help me conceal my glock 19 at work. I have a great iwb holster but in a truck all day it is hard to draw. The holster fit the gun great and stayed on my leg nicely and was comfortable. The issue was the glock 19 was too large. it left a noticeable print on my pant leg and with a hiking boot on was a lengthy process to draw. I could see this holster working great on a smaller gun but the size of the g19 made my pant leg get caught on the draw and showed terribly.
2,Simply Brilliant - but this book isn't,"Was there ever a book whose title didn't reflect its contents & promise?Yes you can read it in an hour or 2, enjoy doing the little quizzes with as much pleasure as doing the 'quick' crossword, and the book has just about as much staying power.If you've never thought about Project/Time Management, then sure read this book once, and get some basic ideas, but it won't transform your life.With chapter titles like ""Know what it is you're trying to do"" and ""Things don't get done if people don't do them"", it's all very simple."
5,"Hot Rod is back, and better than ever!","This reprint of the original Hot Rod is for old time fans and new fans alike. Hot Rod was the transformer that eventually became the new Autobots leader, Rodimus Prime.The vehicle mode of this transformer is stylish and futuristic. The overall look is fairly close to the look in the cartoon.I have always loved this car as it truly deserves the name ""Hot Rod"". The dark blue windows gives it a gleem, while the wing shaped spoiler and side pipes makes it look fast.Transforming into robot mode is fairly easy. Robot mode looks very good -- as good as any other G1 transformer. Ages 7+ should easily be able to transform this.Overall this piece is very durable, and alot of fun to play with. Robot mode looks good, while the vehicle itself looks great! I highly recommend this for any transformer fan, or someone looking to introduce their children to the transformers."
3,A satisfactory Linux starter guide,"This review refers to the Second Edition. I've bought this book mainly for the Caldera Open Linux. Thought Caldera OpenLinux isn't shiny, and the release is pretty old (8 Jan. 1998) its a way to start. The book itself is organized in a satisfactory fashion and contains some good information about most of the casual stuff any Linux user may have to go through. If you want to get more in depth of specific topics about Linux, look elsewhere. This book does not include any information of value for the more knowledgeable Linux user/pro"
3,A broad introduction but often lacking in crucial details,"This review refers to the second edition. The book tries to do too much: installation and maintenance, standard applications and the internet, shells and programming. Organization of the book is weak: some basic subjects are handled twice while slightly more advanced topics are ignored. Caldera's OpenLinux stinks; they try to force you into using their (value-added) products rather than allowing one to use GNU-licensed products."
2,Not Always Original Recordings,"If you are looking for the original recording of Love Me, Love Me, Love to replace your 45. This is not it. A very poor re-recording of that song, in fact."
2,"""New"" recordings?","I don't own this disc, but the image shown by Amazon reads: ""All New Digital Recordings"". This would lead one to believe that these are NOT the original versions. Does that not matter to any of the previous reviewers?"
5,You can't die now! Not now!...not now!....,"Excellent little known film from '59 with Richard Widmark and the great Lee J Cobb.... This one can be viewed either 1:33 or 1:78....the picture is decent, but it looks like a much older film for some reason....it's definitely not the clearest print--but it is very watchable, and the story is pretty good too.... Basically, Widmark is forced to help a mob boss make a safe getaway, but things just don't work out as planned.... This film seems much like a western and could have easily been made as one, as it has a Bad Day at Black Rock kind of feel to it....great stuff here....also, Tina Louise looks much better here than she did on Gilligan's Island....great little twist near the end as well....highly recommended...."
2,Overpriced and poor quality Blu Ray disc...,"I'm writing this review to warn those film buffs like myself who may be tempted to pay the high price for this tantalizing disc. With a stellar cast and widescreen blu ray to boot I jumped and boy am I disappointed! This OLIVE release BR is full of grain, color shifts, spots, and is just terrible ...it looks like a poorly colored in black and white film.To confirm... I'm not reviewing the movie...just letting folks know that to spend 20+ Bucks for this feels terrible as its not up to BR standards.I have been pleased with Olive so far but today also picked up Ramrod and it IS a black and white movie which is marginally better than this BR in quality... but with Joel McRea and Veronica Lake.. it was worth the gamble."
2,Does not turn your hose into a pressure washer,"I bought this item because the description said ""Turn your hose into a pressure washer!"" While I didn't quite expect that, I did expect more than what it is. As a nozzle it seems to be of good enough quality, but a $10 nozzle from a local home improvement store provides just as much pressure.If you need a pressure washer, buy a pressure washer."
2,Worked for very short time,"Great idea, handy handle and soap mixed well.BUT handle broke with very little usage making it unusable.Would NOT buy it again."
5,Fantastic bag,Axiom makes some great products and this bag holds very well on my commute the pockets are great. Rain or shine this bags holds all my stuff great to get this with the Eagle Creek Pack-It Folders and your clothes travel upper class.
5,Finally,"It's about time they released this show on dvd. So funny, so original...one of my all-time favorites. As was previously mentioned, the first season isn't as funny as later seasons, when they really hit their stride, but even lesser Newhart is better than most shows at their best, and it's worth picking this up just to see where it all began."
4,One of TV's great comedies,"They don't make them like they used to. This is one of TV's great comedies, anchored by Bob Newhart, and supported by an excellent cast that changed through the seasons. Season one has almost no Julia Duffy character - the ditzy, pampered maid - no Peter Scolari (the irritating yuppy) in love, and minimal Larry, Darryl and Darryl, the Marx brother like stooges who later become a major fixture on the show.Still Tom Poston, the handyman, Kirk, the narcissistic cafe owner, and the wonderfully inept local Vermont Townsmen do a great job, and they just get better as the show develops. Truly intelligent family fare.I really miss this one considering the current wasteland of staged ""reality"" shows, nasty and violent cop dramas, and smutty dysfunctional family comedies. You can sign me up for this one, and I can't wait for the other seasons."
3,Please release an all season set,"I've not bought this product, mainly because I remember this series well and loved it! However, as others have stated, the first season, while still good, simply doesn't compare to the rest. Like many others, I'm choosing to pass on the first season in hopes all the other seasons will be released. If the powers that be insist on making us purchase the first season, at least include it in an all seasons set. Please release the entire series! THAT, I would buy in a heart beat!"
5,It's been too long a wait!,"Oh my god! This show should have been put on DVD years ago. Bob Newhart is one of the greatest comedians of all time, and he has had the uncanny ability to reinvent himself in multiple series. I loved Newhart when it was still in reruns, and I've never understood why shows like this don't stay on TV in rerun longer. Tom Poston (now deceased) was great, Bob is SO DRY, and if you watch carefully, he gets a little pleased look on his face when he makes a good joke. There are a few really good jokes. Sorry to say I don't like Kirk, but otherwise a great show. When can I get season 2?"
5,Bob does it again!!,"What can I say about this superb show that hasn't already been said. I've already got the four released seasons of 'The Bob Newhart Show' but must say that this is even better. Bear in mind that I'd never seen a single episode of either show before buying the sets so I'm coming to these with a fresh pair of eyes, as it were, and already I can see that 'Newhart' is up there with the true greats of tv comedy. My only problem now is that I've only got two episodes left to watch!! Let's all pray for a miracle that the remaining episodes eventually see the light of day on dvd. A must buy."
3,"Show's great, dvd's skip",Show is excellent but after viewing the set several times i'm getting skips and stops all over the place. When I first viewed them they played great but after awhile they developed glitches which are getting worse everytime i play them. It's not my player because my other dvd's are ok.
5,Newhart - The Complete First Season,Please please please release the entire 8 seasons of The Newhart series that takes place at the Stratford Inn in Vermont! It is one of the best shows ever produced!
3,One of my favorite shows!,"Newhart is one of my favorite sitcoms ever. I have had the pleasure to goto a live taping of this show in Burbank, California. It was a fun time.Bob Newhart is one of my favorite comedians. Also, I enjoy Tom Posten, and of course, Larry, Darryl, and Darryl. I just hope ALL seasons will bereleased regardless of sales figures, or whatever."
4,Newhart rocks!,"when are the next seasons going to be released?? Hope its soon. The episodes were funny and loved the Larry,Daryl and Daryl combo"
5,It's a start...,"... I was 12 when this show first came out. Seeing it now brings back great memories of viewing until I was 20.Of course, as mentioned by many, the show started getting its legs more in Season 2 w/ Stephanie and even more in Season 3 w/ Michael & Stephanie in addition to Larry, Darryl & Darryl owning the Cafe.Fox needs to realize this aspect so they don't give up on sales too early. Season 1 of any series is never really the best work. Look at Seinfeld Season 1 for example. It's definitely not as good as the rest.Seeing these has me ready to buy copies of later season. They can't come soon enough."
5,One of the Best,"This is one of the best sitcoms ever. With so much garbage on TV, I am thrilled to be able to purchase delightful sitcoms such as Newhart. I just received season one last week and have already watched the whole thing. It brings lots of laughs, as well as being clean and wholesome, family friendly. I am ready for season 2. I certainly hope that they will bring out all of the seasons. I know the disappointment when they only bring us one or two seasons of our favorites. Hopefully they will bring us more of this series."
5,"Gotta love ""Newhart""","Hello,I have always been a huge fan of ""Newhart"" and regretted when it went off the air. When it was ""finally"" offered in DVD format this year, I jumped at the chance to purchase the complete first season and can't wait to buy the remaining seasons. This show is an American classic and I look forward to building a complete library. Let's have more Newhart!Mike from Kahnawake"
5,Caring for Preschool Children,This text book is appropriate as a supplement for CDA credential candidates. It offers examples for teachers working with preschool aged children.
4,caring for preschoolers,"I needed the book for class. The delivery was quick and nothing was damaged. The book is very helpful in what you need to have a professioal,smooth running child-care"
5,pricey but good,"I have been drinking this forever. It is a good meal replacement but if on an average day you are not active I suggest that you stay away. Due to the amount of calories, a person that drinks this on a regular and that is not active will gain some weight."
3,not for dieters,"I absolutely love the taste on this drink as I have for years, but when it comes to watching my weight this is not the thing I reach for. Unless you have a high powered exercise routine I would say avoid this one. I do weight watchers and this eats up all my points. So....great taste, but bad for the waistline."
1,Definitely not as good as banana,Some smart dumb ninja brought me this garbage after I asked for a banana nutriment. Certainly nowhere near as satisfactory.
1,Food Frenzy,I bought this game thinking it would be fun to play since I have The Tales of Desperaux that is sooo much fun BUT it was confusiong-boring-gave to grandkids and they gave it back! Didn't like it either!
1,Get Something Else,"I'll get right to the point: this game sucks. My 4-year old niece got it for Christmas. She gets bored before making it past the first mini-game with the snails.The first mini-game goes on forever, and it's not even fun. You just keep shooting snails off the wall for what feels like an eternity. This game would be ok if it were only a few minutes long. But it goes on and on. Like I said, my niece gets so bored with it until she just turns it off and plays MillionHeir or something else.Final verdict: skip the game, please!"
1,Repetitive and Extremely Hard,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer that stated that the game was long, repetitive and hard. It was so aggrevating that no one out of the 10 people that have played this game aging 6 yrs old to about 38 yrs old have all given up on it ticked off at the repetitive motions and rounds. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!"
3,Maybe it will grow on me,"The good: Josh Rouse continues to make good pop music at a time when most of the pop music out there is garbage. And he continues his pattern of recordings that borrow from a new genre each time, ala 1972 and Nashville. Subtitulo has several really good latin influenced songs, one of which (the man who) is a gem, in my opinion.The bad: A few of the songs are really, really bad. ""Givin it up"" is unlistenable disco. ""It looks like love"" is not as bad, but close.The maybe: It seemed a bit short -- maybe that's because I skip a few of the songs each time I listen to it. Maybe it will grow on me, but now, I prefer both 1972 and Nashville."
5,Another Rouse-ing Gem,"Clocking in at only 33 minutes, Subtitulo sounds rather slight at first listen - - almost like it's not there. A few listens in, though, and the songs begin to appear. ""Quiet Town"" has a bouncy lilt to it and perfectly describes its locale. ""Summertime"" does the same - - it's a groovy little jam that would not be out of place on a Jack Johnson album. ""Jersey Clowns"" is a downtemp folk song about lost love and hard decisions. ""Givin' It Up"" is a peppy, catchy tune about kicking a drinking habit gone out of control. I can't say enough good things about Josh Rouse. All the songs here are great. ""Nashville"" is one of my all time favorite albums and I think ""Subtitulo"" will be up there as well. Producer Brad Jones has done another stunning job with the production. He and Rouse should make a pack to always work together. The results are ""down-home real"" and a treat to the senses."
4,His most consistant album..,"For me, there was maybe 3 or 4 tracks off his previous albums that were actually any good. The rest was essentially filler. But it looks like he's finally come around and made an album consistantly enjoyable. Another thing I like about Rouse is that he strives to do something different on every album, it's not the same old same old. I wish Josh the best of luck."
3,Solid,"Solid album. A good buy, in my opinion. I have seen him live a time or two and think a lot of his style."
1,If death is considered educational......,"I would not recommend this aquarium at all! Our results--dead fish, all 4 of them. So, if death is considered educational I guess it gets points for that.We followed the instructions that come with it, but the reality is--there is no filter, it's just a bubble wall that does not act as a filter. So, the water is not really cleaned. And, the air pump is much too strong for this very small 1 1/2 gallon aquarium, causing a huge current that forces the tiny fish to struggle against it. Despite consulting with various aquarium experts at real fish stores, and purchasing a variety of water additives that are supposed to instantly ""age"" water and remove ammonia, we came to the conclusion that this tank is just not functional. I'm furious that my little boy had to experience the death of his pet fish, one by one, and furious that countless other children will probably experience the same thing. This company is trashing Spongebob's good name!"
1,stinks to high heaven,I was given this as a present for my new car purchase to protect it from dings. I put them on as I went shopping at Home Depot. When I came out someone stole them off my car on both sides--they come off easily and went just as easily. My advise is to stay away from anything that is easy to install and remove.
2,Not at all what I expected....,"I was hoping for something you could leave on your vehicle at all times, even while driving. Who has time to get out and put these on in the parking lot before leaving the vehicle?"
5,G. K. Chetserton and Common Sense,"G. K. Chesterton: The Apostle of Common Sense is a great work to serve as an introduction or re-introduction to the writings and life of G.K. Chesterton, one of the most important thinkers and writers of the 20th Century. It is written by the president of the American Chesterton Society, who is a wonderful font of information on the life and writings of Chesterton and the influence he's had on others and world events. Chesterton predicted the beginning of World War II three years after his death, and was influenced Ghandi in wanting independence for India as well as Michael Collins in leading the Irish Rebellion. Chesterton is little understood nor widely read in this century, but that seems to be changing with the increasing discontent with socialism and secular humanism, against which Chesterton fought his entire life. Dennis Sinclair, Medford, Oregon"
3,Mediocre,"This book makes for a good introduction to the world of Chesterton. However any person who is even partially familiar with his works will garner little information from this book.While Dale Alquist is a great scholar, I find his commentary to be one sided at best. I believe (a phrase never used by Mister Alquist) that Chesterton can stand on his own, without commentary."
1,Not a good book,"How much history could a gold necklace really detain? How much information could it bind? Could it be the answer to a murder case? Find out in the Keeper of the Light by Jan O'Donnel Klveness. The story is about a teenage boy, Ian, taking a road trip on his own to a small city called Hatteras on the beach. He made the journey to claim his deceased grandmother's land, or so he thought.I didn't like this book very much because it took way too long to get into. By the time the mystery was introduced, you weren't interested in the book anymore; you just wanted to solve the mystery on your own. Then when the mystery was introduced, the clues and plot went very, very slowly. So give another book a try, and use this one as a last resort."
3,"Comprehensive, if you can find it...","I purchased this book to find out which, if any, universities have online PhD programs. This book did not enlighten me. A few easy-reference charts would have made it much more searchable. It would have been great to look at a chart showing at a glance which schools have developmental psychology programs, for instance. If you already know what school you want to attend, the book has a lot of information, including facts such as how many students have dropped out of each program. But don't use this book for your starting point unless you enjoy reading page after page of 6-point font."
2,Too much,This book has too much information if you are interested in a clinical Ph.D. It lists all psychology Ph.D. programs as well as master's programs. I suggestInsider's Guide to Graduate Programs in Clinical and Counseling Psychology: 2006/2007 Edition (Insider's Guide to Graduate Programs in Clinical Psychology).
3,okay,"This video presents basic facts and demonstrates what individuals can do at home. I was disapointed that it showed less video of the recycling process or sweeping shots of junkyards, which the photo on the cover suggests, which is what I had hoped to show students in my classroom. Mostly, the video shows the host sitting in a living room with shots of a family recycling in their home. In that respect, it is good because it helps people visualize how easily they can implement recycling at home."
4,Should be required viewing in schools,This is a wake up call for all. There are many quite easy steps all people can and must take before we do away with the very earth we all live on.
5,volume 6 of his systematic theology,"Moltmann was indebted to Barth for the emphasis on linking epistemology and ethics as necessarily dependent on each other. He also borrowed Barth's ""doctrine of lights""; which receives its due articulation here. You must have volume 6 to complete the series. Moltmann is not an optional read. He is mandatory."
1,Does not fit,"The mirror was 1/8"" inch too big. I ordered the dorman oe fit complete mirror and threw this in the garbage."
1,Doesn't fit Convex mirrors,"This mirror was listed as a ""replacement"" for the passenger mirror of my Chevy.However, this glass is a ""flat"" mirror. The mirror on my truck is slightly ""convex"".This glass would not fit the mirror as it was advertised forBeware when buying."
5,"Good Fit, Great quality",The mirror fit almost perfect. One corner was a bit off but not very noticeable. The only reason you could notice it was because i placed the mirror over the cracked mirror that I was replacing. Installation took around 45 seconds and the mirror quality was a 10. Would definitely buy again.
2,"Good for Famous Authors, but Most Great Authors Left Out","This book is supposed to be something you look up when you like a particular author and want to know which other authors write similar things. The problem I have with it is that the authors recommended are already famous authors which anyone who had read a fair number of books would already have heard of. The non top one hundred chart selling type of authors are not listed here, either to look up their names or as recommendations. These were the authors I hoped this book would help me find not the ones with the million dollar publicity machines behind them. Granted some of these famous authors are great writers with literary masterpieces that readers will enjoy reading but I would imagine most people would have already heard of them and their books. Very disappointing as the theme is a good idea but the execution falls short. There are authors who are at the very least just as good as most of the authors in this book and usually better."
2,"Too Small, Too Superficial, and Too Expensive","I was forced to buy this book to serve as a textbook for a college philosophy class. We covered Woodhouse's small booklet (barely over 100 pages of actual text) in a week. While I understand that the book is to be a preface to philosophy, I found myself covering terms and definitions that I had learned in my middle-school logic class. You definitely do not get your money out of this one. If you have a choice at buying this, consider Introduction to Philosophy by Norman Geisler and Paul Feinberg instead. Longer, more informative, and cheaper."
5,a classic,"Grimsley's Hard Hand of War was published 8 years ago, and remains the best account of evolving Federal war policy towards the Confederacy over the 4 years of the American Civil War. Grimsley carefully outlines the evolution from the conciliatory strategy of the first year of the war through the pragmatic policies of the mid period, and finally to the ""hard war"" which is most associated with General Sherman. his argument is nuanced and well documented. Highly Recommended."
2,Hard Hand of War is Inaccurate,"The primary source of material for relations between the U.S. army and Southern civilians is the Provost Marshal Records of the United States Army. Dr. Grimsley does not mention these records in his bibliography, he seems to be unaware of their existence. No book can be considered authoritative if the major source of information has been omitted.U.S. generals such as Robert Milroy, David Burbage, and Eliezar Paine were very harsh toward Southern civilians, as revealed by their reports in the Provost Marshal records. Grimsley omits all these people from his book, they are not to be found in the index to his book.In short, Dr. Grimsley has selected the information which suits his thesis and has omitted the information which contradicts his theory. The research for this book is woefully incomplete and, thus, the conclusion is flawed.The Provost Marshal records are in the National Archives and are readily available to any scholar."
2,What a Chore!,"Thought this would be good for research, but I might not live long enough to finish it. Sooooooooo difficult to read!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Do not believe the synopsis of this film! The word ""dispensationalism"" isn't even spoken until the last 2 minutes of the film! This is nothing but an attack on Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, etc. And if you're not sure what a cult is, they spend a bunch of time defining that. I am a Christian that worships in the Presbyterian church. So I am not here to defend the churches listed above or even make a judgment for or against them. My point, though, is that I purchased this movie on Amazon Prime Videos because I thought there was going to be an educated discussion about the history and error of dispensationalism - just as the film was promoted. And it is not that! Why they chose to link these above churches with this movement, I cannot figure! Nowhere can I find these churches as being the historical source of dispensationalism. So, again, don't waste your money!"
2,Play Volume Too Low!!!!!,This product is a nice size and to start using it I only had to pull the protective strip out so the battery had contact however the product does not play back loud enough even when I speak very loudly.
2,Little Reminder My Lil' Reminder Deluxe- Set of 2,I got this for a me and a friend. She is 93 years old and very hard of hearing. But this device is not very loud at all. I even have trouble hearing it and I am not hard of hearing. And there is no volume control so is pretty useless for what I had intended. I will not be getting any more of these.The product seems like a good idea but just not that good of quality. Katherine Bacon
2,Doesn't work that well,"This product is a hit and miss. It works for only a brief amount of time and only if you are extremely careful with it. By this I mean making sure it doesn't hit, bang or come into contact with other items as it will stop working. Also the recorder isn't really loud and sometimes your words are garbled.However, for really quick messages and intermittent use; it works fine."
3,Half good,"I had given this as a Christmas gift. Only one of the units worked when right out of the package. The other unit just flashes the red light when you try to record, play, or erase. Not real happy with the purchase. They were cheap enough that retuning them wasn't really worth it."
2,Junk in a drawer,This is the same pocket reminders they were selling on TV about two years ago and is just junk in a drawer. Save your money and write a note.
1,My L'il Reminder,They worked just fine until the second day when the erase buttons no longer worked. Both are pieces of crap.
4,Used Book,I bought this to use with students. I was interested in short stories that can be read in one session. The stories are about real experiences of everyday life.
5,ATotally cool book!,I love this book! I feel it shows true character and promise from the author. I think this is a literary work of art and should be owned by every teen in america!
5,Another great Terri Blackstock novel and series,"Ms. Blackstock's works--her plots, woven with mystery and faith, her interesting characters, et al--are always first rate. ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" ""Word of Honor,"" and ""Trial by Fire"" are no exceptions. These books, along with ""Private Justice"" and ""Line of Duty,"" comprise her five-volume 'NEWPOINT 911' series... a series which will entertain and inspire readers. Highly recommended! --RON HOWE (a.k.a. Toby Martin II)"
4,Must read!,I couldn't put this book down! Such a great suspense series! I can't wait to read the next book in the series!!
1,Predictable,"After reading the 1st book in the series and knowing ""whodunit"" throughout most of the book, I thought I would give this series another shot. About 50 pages into the book I knew who the criminal was. I never finished this series. However, I have enjoyed other books by Terri Blackstock."
2,Weak Characterization...Correct That! No Characterization!,"Wow, it shocks me that this book received so many good reviews. I ended up putting it down after about 130 pages because the book had absolutely NO characterization. Each character was a stick figure, very one-dimensional. All I knew was their name and occupation. How am I supposed to sympathize or like these characters that way? It also was confusing to have two main characters with very similiar names (Allie and Aggie). I also was confused by all the characters introduced throughout and the purpose for them. There were multiple meaningless chapters with just people gossiping...why? What new information does that reveal? This is the first Blackstock book I've read. Are all her characters so one-dimensional?! If so, this will be the last one I read."
2,"Pricey, disposable","It worked well for both cutting and brazing, but I got a little too close to the work at one point and burned the supplied screw-on tip. I searched around and was unable to find a replacement. I evetually contacted Bernzomatic and was told that there are NO replacement parts available for this item!I found it rather strange to have a $100+ (list price) item made essentially useless by not making a $1.98 piece of brass available. I will NOT be buying another one to obtain a new tip. I find it unacceptable to have a torch made useless for anything otherthan lighting the BBQ for want of a replacement tip.The other drawback to this torch was the life of the oxygen cylinder. Under medium use you can get about 15 minutes of working time per cylinder.I would not recommend this item until Bernzomatic makes the tips available for replacement."
1,worthless,"The gases (both fuel and oxygen) are regulated only by their respective valves connecting each hose to the gas cylinders. The valves on the set I purchased today were entirely unable to keep the pressure consistent. I would ignite the fuel gas and add oxygen to get a neutral flame. Then I would hold the torch still and watch the flame change from neutral to carbonizing, back through neutral to oxygen rich... The cycle would continue until the torch extinguished itself from too much oxygen. I spent almost an hour trying to get it to stay lit long enough to heat up a stubborn bolt, but it never did. I used up the whole ounce of oxygen (1.1 cubic feet) that comes with the set, and took it back at the store where I purchased it. Save yourself an aggrevating experience."
2,No Replacement Parts!,"It worked well for both cutting and brazing, but I got a little too close to the work at one point and burned the supplied screw-on tip. I searched around and was unable to find a replacement. I eventually contacted Bernzomatic and was told that there are NO replacement parts available for this item!I found it rather strange to have a $100+ (list price) item made essentially useless by not making a $1.98 piece of brass available. I will NOT be buying another one to obtain a new tip.

Under medium use you can get about 15 minutes of working time per cylinder.I would not recommend this item until Bernzomatic makes the tips available for replacement. If they made the tips available, my rating would go to 4+."
4,It got the job done.,"I'm a DIY'er and have no need for a full oxy-acetylene setup. This little torch allowed me to cut 48"" of mild steel, albeit with a lot of fiddling around (I am a rookie tho). As others have said, it is tough to get the crappy little valves adjusted ""just right"". That said, I got the job done and this little torch only cost me $60. I look forward to the next frozen bolt on my car cause it's messing with the wrong guy now..."
1,"Bad Smells, Bad food, and, oh yeah, an adoption...","There is nothing in this book that you can't get from FCC (Families with Children from China), the apc newsgroup, or other good webbased resources.And as someone who has lived in Asia for the past four years, I found the constant complaints about smells, noise,food, how people acted etc. to be rude and almost racist. I don't suppose the author's husband (because that is who tells the story in this book)has developed much love for the country of his daughter's birth. That was way the book read to me."
1,Adopting in China: A Practical Guide,"I'm so glad I got this one from the library & didn't waste my money on it! Of the many, many adoption stories I've read, mostly on the internet, plus The Lost Daughters of China and A Passage to the Heart (both excellent), this one sticks in my mind as the only negative one. And boy was it negative! I could'nt believe all the complaining this guy did about the food, the people, etc., etc. For most people adopting from China, this is one of the happiest times of their lives. He seemed more concerned about working out & what he was going to eat than his beautiful new daughter. Poor kid; I hope she has a nice mommy."
2,How about a little respect??,"I agree with the previous reviewer. The husband really has no respect for culture. The wife is wayyy too good for this guy! Unfortunately, he's the father of a beautiful baby girl. Let's hope she can help him grow up!!! The book really didn't provide any new information or insights to China adoption. I read the below reviews and bought it anyway. Anyone want to buy my copy now? I love to keep my books but it's just not one I would read again since it's mostly written with disregard for his daughters wonderful culture. Sad."
1,Whiny and Negative -- A Big Disappointment,"I should have scrolled all the way down in the reader reviews. If I had, I would have discovered that others reacted the same way I did to this book (which I was really looking forward to). The book is self-centered and negative at every turn: China is hot and smelly, the food is bad, babies pee and poop, flying coach is the pits. There was little evidence of any attempt to understand or appreciate China, although there was clear gratitude toward ""the China Team"" who facilitated the adoption experience.If you want to read the story of someone's adoption journey to China and to get a real feel for China and how the adoption situation there comes to be, I would highly recommend Karin Evans' ""The Lost Daughters of China."""
1,I wish I could give this no stars!!!!!!!,"These writers complained, complained, complained! I actually threw this book in the garbage. I was offended by the authors' descriptions of the Chinese food, etc. Definitely ugly Americans."
1,Breaks Easily and Terrible Customer Service!,"I have several glasses similar to this one so I know you need to hand wash them and be very careful. I had washed this one and put it on a towel to dry and it shattered. Emailed Central Chef and they basically called me a liar and said I must have hit against the side of my sink rather than admitting that maybe I got a faulty glass. Not happy about their customer service. I would rather have someone tell me ""Unfortunately there isn't much we can do for you, however here is a gift certificate for 10% off your next purchase"". Terrible customer service if you ask me. I will never buy anything from Central Chef again and I will not recommend them to anyone."
5,Return of the Native,"English fiction has many great heroines but none that stirs the imagination more than Eustacia Vye, a beautiful brooding woman."
1,Wow! what a disappointment!!,"I was really looking forward to use this radio. I verified that I have quite a few HD stations in my reception area before I purchased the radio.Disappointment no. 1: I managed to receive only a single HD station.Disappointment no. 2: With the built-in antennas I was unable to receive most analog stations that other radios have no problem with. The external antennas worked a better but only marginally.Disappointment no. 3: Radio stopped working couple of times and the only way to get it working again was to unplug it from the power, wait few seconds and plug it in again.Disappointment no. 4: Everything (power, antennas) plugs or screws into the portable radio and not the base which makes it not very portable.This radio is obviously going back."
4,Nice radio but you need to be pretty close to stations!,"I got this radio directly from Radiosophy which has shipped pre-orders recently. It is an excellent analog radio with fine reception with good AM and FM antennae. As far as the hybrid digital signal, if you live IN a major city like NY you will receive ALL the HD stations easily but as you go away from the transmission towers like in the suburbs you will lose many of the HD signals. However, I must say that the transition from analog to HD is significant especially on the AM band -- quite nice. The FM is also very good, cd-like quality. This radio is well made and has many connection options. I give it 4 stars not because there is anything wrong with the radio but because I lose many stations because of where I live. Go figure!!!!!"
4,yet another side of Fru...,"John Frusciante never ceases to amaze me...This is a good addition to an existing collection of John's releases. However, it's very different from his other releases. There's more a rockin' jam-band feel throughout, but it's still got plenty of John's amazing vocals (although I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of excessive reverb on vocal tracks)"
3,Just not what you would expect from a Chilli Pepper,"This is an album that comes from one of the foremost great guitarist of my life time. This shows you, as well as all of John's solo works, how diverse he can be. This is a beautiful and relaxing album. The singing fits every note in the songs."
5,:),"Extremely beautiful. I love every minute, and I love everything that the amazing and incredible John Frusciante has created. This album is incredible, and you should only buy it if you really know who John Frusciante is, and what he is trying to do. Amazing album, you just can't say enough about Mr. Frusciante. Nice work by Josh and Joe as well."
4,"Very good, but for an audience that is older than the show.","I bought this for a two year old girl who loves the show, but this video is more geared for five years old and up, with live footage of construction equipment edited between cuts of Bob and his friends. I was hoping for a long ""Bob the Builder"" episode, so I was a little disappointed, but if you've got a 5+ year old that likes construction equipment, they'll enjoy this!"
1,Wrong movie on right disc,"I received Bob the Builder On Site, which I ordered but the movie on the disc was Thomas On Site. The pic and the description on both the case and the dvd were that of Bob. It appears that someone burned this dvd in his garage. I am very upset with this vendor and will not purchase anything else from them. The only reason I'm not returning the dvd is because fortunately my son likes Thomas and wants to keep it."
1,Wrong DVD in bob the builder packaging!!,"Very upsetting as I purchased this DVD for my 3yo for a 2 day roadtrip only to open the DVD, place it in the player as we are traveling and realize it is a Thomas & friends DVD disquised in a Bob the Builder DVD! Not happy at all!!"
2,American Bob on site,"Not very good due to the change from english to american accent, (no offence intended to the americans) but after my sons have had bob the builder in english over a year they just dont enjoy the american version. My sons are 2 and 3, the best type of critics."
5,Bob the Builder with Real Life Construction,"My 3 yr old son loves this video. He would watch Bob the Builder from time to time before this video but this video has made him a BIG Bob the Builder fan.The video features Bob and the Gang talking about building roads and bridges and cuts to clips of real life construction. My son loves getting to see the real machines in action. The video is well done and switches from Bob to real scenes quite smoothly.If your little builder is a fan of Bob the Builder and big equipment, he is sure to love this video. We've watched it over and over again."
4,What an amazing compilation!,"Some great, some strange, some experimental, and some that may be better in the original language, but a fabulous cooperative effort by the greatest storytellers of our time. These works show the intricate complexity characteristic of a great short, and most illustrate that more effort goes into 5000 words than 50,000, or 500,000 in the case of Rushdie. (sorry, couldn't resist).I can't pick a favorite. Some will stay with me forever, and a few have already faded in memory, but I am richer having read them all. Thank you, Nadine Gordimer, for this exceptional collection."
2,Astonishingly bad,"Art is ruined by oversaturated and ugly coloring. The story, though--it's obvious, insipid, and *boring*. I cannot fathom why anyone would have given this five stars. The ultra violence feels like it was put in to appeal to teenage boys who want something ""dark."" Batmans fall feels completely fake, so his redemption is not a thrill.This is a terrible, terrible story barely made worthwhile by good art, and then re-ruined by horrible coloring. Seriously, Frank Miller isn't *that* great, but this horrible and sloppy copy makes him look like the genius people think he is."
4,Great self contained Batman epic.,"I picked up this book after an hour or so walking up and down the racks of a comic store. I bought it because it was well priced and quite thick. The art was in the eighties/early nineties style DC art which I was indifferent about, but after reading I found the art to be a big contributing factor to the tale. The story was very well written and I was greatly surprised by this book. I went for quantity of pages and got quality of story as well.Very big story which follows a cult of vagrants reign over Gotham city led by an enigmatic holy man. The story starts with Batman in their hands and goes back to tell the story of his capture and goes on to be one of the most epic Batman stories I've read. Dark, psychological and big.Gotham sees one of it's darkest hours and Batman will be broken and fighting for his own sanity.I highly recommend this book. Enjoy."
2,Bill Wray Wants You To Save Your Hard Earned Money,"Is there any doubt that Bill Wray is the hot shot colorist for the working man? I doubt it. Not after his work on this book. See, Jim Starlin is a lousy writer, always has been, but Berni Wrightson is a really good artist. This book originally came out during the crazy Batmania of '89, and do you know what sweet old Bill Wray did? He did the ugliest coloring job in fancy comics history. Tons of ugly greens, and reds and browns and purples. He knew this book was a stinker, but he didn't want anyone to get suckered into buying it because of Wrightson's extremely alreet art, so he screwed it up the best he could. Way to take one for the team Bill Wray! You truly are an unsung hero of corporate comics!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This nutso leader type certainly provided a worthy opponent for The Batman.He sees how far you actually would have to go to actually break The Batman, whether torture, drugs, or whatever, along with some clever PR and spin."
1,paper quality?,"the worst cheap recycled paper used for this book. colors look bad, bad for your eyes.great story like this deserves better. shame on you DC!!!"
1,One of the WORST Batman Stories ever.,"Jim Starlin's ""The Cult"" is one of the worst Batman stories ever. I had high expectations for the book when I started reading it, because it is widely considered one of the best Batman stories. If you enjoy a cowering, broken, scared vigilante, then this is your perfect Batman story. Batman is completely out of character for the entire book and even tries to run away from Gotham at one point. He goes as far as to kill someone and wishes pain and suffering on most of the people he engages in combat. This is nowhere near the level of praise it has received. If you want a TRUE Batman classic, read. LONG HALLOWEEN, DARK VICTORY, YEAR ONE or DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. If you want a complete joke of a Batman story, this books right up your alley."
1,Insulting to my intelligence,"This video is awful. It is a shame that people out there consider anything on The Discovery Channel to be informative. The whole video is based on the premise that the general public thinks the Freemasons are a ""secret society"" with ""pagan"" and ""satanic"" rituals, cryptic codes, and ""influence"" dangerous to the establishment. I find it hard to believe that any American could be this ignorant. Worst of all, the voiceover/narrator guy speaks with a sppoky, creepy, suspenseful vibe... it's just insulting to anybody's intelligence."
5,"alive, honest, real; evidence of the Truth.","many thanks to ms. price and to God for inspiring this documentation of her story that has so inspired me. we are all drawn to real struggles, real transformation, and real power. God is this power. God is real. this book made me irrevocably aware that the God of the universe cares about the smallest details of our lives and wants to pour out his unfathomable goodness, in tangible and intangible ways, on hearts that are surrendered to his care."
5,Drain Grate,Had 4 or 5 cracked drain grates and bought these to replace broken ones. These are exactly what I wanted and needed.Thank YouSteven k.
3,Brings back memories,"When I was young I remember my family closing all the doors down the hallway and having my cat at the end, then we would shoot these at her. She would go nuts! She would try to swat at them and eat them, it was adorable. Now we shoot these at my dog who also goes nuts over these. This toy does seem less durable than the one I had as a kid. The disks get stuck sometimes and the trigger also sticks. I would not really recommend these to someone because you can just use nerf toys and get those at the store. I mainly bought these because of memories."
3,Not battery operated,"I bought this for my 2 boys to play with! Unfortunately, they are not battery operated, so the trigger is VERY hard for my 5yo to pull. Even when my husband and I use them it is difficult, and hurts my finger after just one round of discs. I should have specifically looked for a battery operated set."
5,Straight Underground Latino,"E-legal, you've got some throwed ass beats, off da chain hommie. Da mucho orgullo oir musica de nuestra gente para nuestra gente. Buenos mensajes, buenos beats, keep up the good work. Ya tienes distribuicion o management? I can't say it enuff, good work man, way better than some of them commercial posers out there, they know who they are. Paz."
5,"Best 12"" Star Wars Figure MADE!!!!!!!!!!","This is a figure that has great play value, for your young Jedi.It will help your child develope a strong imagination. Now for the big Kid's adding this item to your collection complet's the Hoth line. The package art is great. The new head sculpt of Luke Skywalker is great beast likeness yet!!!!!!!Get Luke and his Taun Taun befor theyare not in this solarsystem any more."
4,Good writing crappy artwork,The story and writing continue to make interesting developments as the survivors try to survive winter. Storywise it continues to be interesting and cool. However the artist was replaced by this second volume and goes from Tony Moores AMAZING A+ to charlie adlards C grade work .Luckily like i mentioned the storylines are strong enough to carry the series and is still worth buying if you liked the first volume. there is always the what could have been if the original artist stayed on but i still love this series and will get the next one.
5,Best zombie comic series so far.,Robet kirkman is one of the best writers of his time. The walking dead is truely a master piece. I know this is a review for number vol. 2. But things keep getting better and better further into the series. I hope he never stops writing the story following Rick and the people he meets while trying to survive a zombie invasion.
3,Great Comic kind of weird on the Kindle.,"I bought the comics after I started watching the TV show on AMC. Reading the black and white comic on the black and white kindle would seem to be ideal, but I was rather disappointed. The black and white kindle just does not have enough pixels to do the artwork justice, but it gets the job done. For the price I would just buy the printed version. As a long time reader of comics I don't think I'll be making the switch to digital comics quite yet."
3,I had to squint,"Great story, great graphics, but the text is too small to show up well on my kindle. Very difficult to read."
1,no kindle edition,"I'm sure its worth more then 1 star but hello...will someone get around to fixing the problem with the kindle edition...there is like what ..30pages at the most...come on guys, Ppl are waiting."
4,Fun Read,"I decided to purchase these since I'm a huge fan of the TV show, and I have not been disappointed. The TV show deviates from the graphic novels quite a bit, but it keeps the reading fun."
5,"WARNING: If you start reading this series, you will NEED to read them ALL",Worth the read. Not the same story as the AMC television series but all the entertainment value! The individual panel reader works well with the Kindle or any Kindle Cloud Reader.
4,Great series,"So not like the tv series,but just as good. I love this series and it is one of the greatest series of it's genre."
4,Great Series Made Affordable on Amazon,"I purchased the first two volumes of the series on Amazon, but eventually found out buying the Compendiums through Amazon was a better value. The one advantage the volumes have over the Compendiums, is that the amount is much less intimidating. The Walking Dead is a great but an incredibly dark story. Having something as large as a compendium can make reading more difficult. Also my friends love borrowing the smaller volumes like this one. To each his(or her) own:)"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is amazing as good as the show!!!!!!!!! I LOVE RICK he is the best character in this story
5,A Survival Series that Will Survive Generations,"Go Robert Kirkman! So far no one has been able to tackle this genre quite like Kirkman. I always wanted more intellectual scenerios from my zombie movies, but with all the blood and action, I felt kind of dumbed down. Through this comic series we have a lot of time to explore the human mind when something globally tramatic happens. With the story spread very comfortably, we get fast page-turning when we read about the survivors' personal crisises, and we get cold hard chills when we are revealed the dead. I actually got pretty scared reading some parts. The writing method is very effective.What more could we ask for? We got new characters, a new area, and new problems. I am dying to see how they overcome the next one. Word of advice: ""Do not let your eyes stray"" you will want to read each panel carefully, because when you are revealed the shocking dialogue It's really intense."
1,The Kindle edition would be nice already!,"How long does a typical listing remain ""under review""? I would love to be able to continue to read this series (the first volume was AWESOME), but haven't been able to order the Kindle edition for over a month now. Don't want to skip over to volume three, but waiting for such a long time for an issue like this to be resolved is agonizing! Reading the reviews of everyone that has purchased the paperback is almost a form of torture as so many people are raving about this volume, so please help us Kindle owners out. PLEASE!"
2,"The Walking Dead, Vol. 2: Miles Behind Us","This was a great read for me. I absolutely love the show, and wanted to see what was missing from the original. I have to say, I cannot wait to read the next volume! I recommend this to ALL of my friends & coworkers. I now have so many reading about Rick and his group. Please keep the stories coming!"
5,The graphic novel is a different genre.,I enjoy reading the graphic novels. Mr. kirkman knows how to lay a story down and keep you interested on the edge of your seat.
4,Very interesting,I am a huge fan of the Tv series and I am now becoming as much of a fan of the graphic novels. It is fun to compare the two. G
5,Walking Dead keeps up with the pace!,"After reading Volume 1, I knew that Robert Kirkman had his work cut out for him if he was to match the excitement, characterization, and fantastic story in Volume 2. The short answer: He does. Volume 2 takes the characters we've just started getting to know in volume 1 and puts them into new situations, develops them further, and all the while gives us more than enough zombie fighting. It's a great series and Volume 2 is certainly worth picking up."
1,non-tasty,"I like the idea, but the flavor needs to be changed. I personally thought is was disgusting. If the flavor was better, then maybe the mood of my partner and I would have went better that time."
4,Review,"Order for the book was fulfilled in a satisfactory timely manner. The content of the book was interesting, at times very, very touching and sometimes though not often, a bit of a stretch (fanciful). But I liked it. It is a book about the author's personal day to day observations and impressions gained from living in that particular part of Nebraska and it included occasional glimpses of his family and boyhood in Iowa. The author is someone I would like to be neighbors with----he's obviously a great guy with a warmth and sense of humor that places him well above most of the slobs who inhabit this earth (including myself). Is this review long enough? Can I stop now?"
5,Outstanding book for new investors,"I read this book when it came out last year and I must say in a single year it has changed my financial life forever. Although I don't invest in Vanguard funds, a favorite of the authors, I have found low cost index investing the way to go (if you are in education or non-profit world, TIAA-CREF offers some really good low cost index fund alternatives). I am healthier and wealthier for reading this book. You will too!"
3,Good book but didn't learn anything new,"Like the 'Little book of common sense investing', this book would have been interesting for me if I hadn't read any other investment books before hand. But having read an 'All about indexes' book and a couple of other ones that covered value investing and general tips, I didn't really get much out of it. I ended up throwing it away afterwards, not because it was bad just because it didn't have anything new or interesting."
3,Bought the cut down the forest version,America needs to read books on different typs of investiing. To many Americans are ignorant when it comes to investing their hard earned money.
3,The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing,Very basic but good. Definitely for the beginner is why I give it a three star.
5,Wisdom for you.,Want to improve your life in more ways than you know? Buy this book! Its quite simply the best advice out there. I wish I had this book twenty years ago and followed the great wisdom within. Read and have a happy life of investing and have more time to do all the other things that are priorities in your life. Successful investing is actually quite simple and this book lays out what you need to know.
5,Superb,"If you are going to read one investment book, I hope you are lucky enough to read this one. Its the only investment book that you need. One of the thing I like about the book is the authors give actual advise and tell you a great approach to investing. They don't claim to be #1 but give time tested strategies to make smart investment descions and spend the rest of your time where you need to.Also trying to beat there strategy may only work for a small lucky percentage. So read this book and you really do not need to read any further."
5,The best single investment book I've read,"The title of the review says it all. Some people don't like its reference to Efficient Market Theory, but the folks here aren't hidebound and use it as a means to an end. This single book will do the average investor more good (if read and believed) than any ten other books on investing."
4,Great book,The book covers some very basic but yet very important concepts that contribute to a successful long term investor. If you need to learn these concepts for the first time or just review this book does a great job.
4,Interesting and valuable read,"This book is very well-written and easily comprehensible, even if it is quite basic. Readers looking for anything but a pretty simplistic overview of investing basics will be disappointed. This fundamental approach to investing, of course, is precisely what is advocated by Mr. Bogle and the legions of Bogleheads. The latter 1/3 of the book also gives extremely brief overviews of a myriad of other financial topics, from life insurance to wills and trusts. These brief overviews do not contain enough information to be very useful, but it's a good introduction to the concepts. Overall I do believe that I am a wiser investor after having read this book. Recommended."
5,Should be required reading for all investors,"Of all the books I've read on investing (and there've been many), none were as straight-forward and enjoyable as this one. It's an excellent book for new investors, longtime investors who want to invest with more confidence, and young adults just heading out into the world. I wish I'd had been given the advice in this book years ago."
2,A Hopeless Jumble...,"I am a fan of John Bogle's so I bought this book. I was impressed by the strength of the reviews.However, I now realize that most of the reviews were written by friends of the authors. Take that into account when buying the book.The first review of the book by V. Martinez (who apparently is not a friend of the authors) is dead on. The book is somewhat disorganized and hard to follow. The writing style is dry.I think there are better books out there for investors."
5,Paulette Carlson,"This is a brilliant album, every song is just great. Paulette has the most wonderful and distinct voice you could ever wish to hear.Her newest album 'It's About Time' was a long time coming, so the title is quite apt. I hope she records more albums. Such a beautiful voice should not be hidden away."
3,Not as good as the first line..,"I had good expectations for series 2 but they are not as good as the first,smaller and the detail is lacking.I only ordered Noire and Szaltax just to see how they were before getting the whole set.I have'nt opened them yet ,but in the package they are just,,OK. Maybe the others are better,but I will not order the rest. Maybe I'm just too picky,Just not as good as series1"
3,Cocktail Additions,"Excellent quantity for price. More sugary than pomegranate, but a pretty and fun presentation to a cocktail or any non-alcoholic beverage!Placed it on the rim of the kids glasses, and, as expected, they loved their ""cocktails"", too!Fun and relatively inexpensive addition for any occasion."
1,Did not receive the DVD I ordered!!!!,"I did not receive the DVD I ordered!!! I ordered Leslie Sansone's Muscle Mile, but I received her Evening Walk. I did not want this DVD. I returned it, but haven't heard back. So I guess I'm just out of luck. Buyers beware!!! If I ever do get the DVD I ordered or my money back, I'll post a response."
5,Great short workout,"I also bought the DVD with this title and was so disappointed to find it was not the same workout. And I had given my VHS copy away to a friend before I realized the mistake! The DVD doesn't use the weights and the ""music"" is so irritating. I'm glad to be able to order another video because this is my favorite short work out. Also the VHS doesn't seem to be offered on her website store. I'm just beginning to walk, I have a couple of other Leslie Sansone DVD's and I just love how easy it is to follow her."
1,Those terrible reviews are accurate!!,"This was SO misleading. The back of the DVD suggests this workout uses weights. It does not. Furthermore, it isn't a new workout at all. Remember that awful ""Walk Diet"" DVD by Leslie? Well this is the same one without the added two mile walk. I think it has a new title because after reading the ""Walk Diet"" reviews, no one would ever buy it. So of course, they had to change the name and give it a new cover. This is just outrageous deception. No wonder everyone thinks they received the wrong disc. They didn't, they were just victims of fraud."
1,Worthless,I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone. I was excited to find out she had a new release. I wanted a short tape to do before work. When I received this tape I felt liked I had been ripped off. It was boring and worthless. This tape would only interest someone who has never exercise before. This was a total waste of my money.
3,Wrong workout but I loved it,"After a few weeks I had to add weights to the routine to keep a sweat and after a month I bought a new workout from her that I love, I'll have to agree with the other reviews I do think it is the wrong workout for the description, however it was a great wrokout for me, it was low impact, took no eye hand cordination which I do not have and got me back in shape to do more intense workouts after the birth of my daughter. I would recomend it to someone with limited motion, pre or post pregnancy and elderly, for those of us that fit those categories GREAT workout."
2,Kindle format is very hard to read,"I purchased the Kindle version of this book. Though the material is interesting and thought-provoking, the format of the printed page on the kindle is very hard to read.The type-set used may work very well for the printed book, but simply taking a page ""image"" and transferring into a Kindle format is very unsatisfactory.I love the Kindle for its portability, not to mention it makes it easier to select books based on sample downloads. But more work has to go into the engine that is used to transfer the printed page. It is not adjustable with the traditional tools available on the Kindle (eg font sizing change, orientation, line spacing, etc). Neither can you highlight or connect notes to the text. A simple zoom option would be helpful.Recommend to Amazon:(1) warning on those books that are ""image-transfer"" on the Kindle(2) Add a software ""zoom"" to the Kindle tools.Recommend to the Customer: Buy the hardcopy version of this book."
4,Allie the Allergic Elephant,This was another good buy to help educate my preschooler about his food allergy. This book will also be donated to school to help others learn about food allergies.
4,did the job,"My daughter is 2 and we found out she is allergic to peanuts. I didn't really know how to explain it to her, so I bought this book to help. She totally understands her allergy because of this book, every time an allergy is mentioned she says ""like Allie Elephant and me"". Because of this book she understands that some people can eat peanuts, and other people cannot. It did the job so I think it was completely worth it, but I do think it's important to mention that my daughter hates this book. I only was able to read it to her twice before she would protest it. I think she is scared by the images of Allie with hives, and swollen lips..."
5,Excellent for pre-school and kindergarten,"The book was the perfect book to have my show bring to pre-school for show and tell, or for book sharing time. Every teacher that read it to the class ended up buying one for themselves to keep in the classroom.At kindergarten, it was the same thing.. note from the teacher saying how much they appreciated the book and where did I get it.Finally when my son was a bit older, we gave it to a pre-schooler we knew who had a peanut allergy so that child in turn could educate his own classes.Only useful for the early years (age 3 to 7), but very very well done and on target for that age and understanding."
3,Cute book,"This is a cute book, and I think it gets the point across to a small child, but I did have higher hopes for it, so I was a little disappointed. I will keep looking for a book that better explains the allergy to my child, and how he can be proactive in dealing with it. I think this book is maybe better for a very young child who is first learning about his allergy. My child is 2 but I feel like he needs more than this book offers. Still, I think he'll like it."
1,"Um, there are better books out there...","This book didn't even make it in front of our daughter. The message is just so wrong, the pictures of swollen lips etc were completely unnecessary, and I presume the answers to the questions is no? There are better books out there."
4,Great educational tool,I bought this book to improve my five year old's classmates' understanding of her peanut allergy. It helped me introduce the idea of a peanut safe environment in her school and explain to her classmates why a peanut-safe environment was important for my daughter's health. It is a great book for young children with clear illustrations and an interesting character.
2,"God, please let the old IRS albums be re-released!","To all who read this. If you ever see a copy of either ""Hexbreaker!"" or ""Roman Gods"", buy them! Fleshtones at their best. I kick myself... for never getting ""Hexbreaker!"", but at least I do have a vinyl copy of ""Roman Gods"". These were released on the IRS label."
5,a fun read for mother and daughter,I bought this book for my daughter after she begged me to on our way home from seeing the Catwoman movie. We both enjoyed reliving the Catwoman experience together through Jasmine Jones' adaptation. We took turns reading it aloud and didn't want to stop until we got to the end. I heartily recommed this book as a mother/daughter bonding tool - and just for fun!
2,Trust me on this one,"Out of the sheer horror that someone recommended this book over Baugh and Cable's A History of the English Language and several other wonderful histories available, I find myself writing my first review. I was unlucky enough to have this book as an undergrad a number of years ago, and along with a general dislike of it that I've always carried, I specifically remember that the exercises were impenetrable. Now that I am getting a PhD in the history of the English language, I can safely say that I am achieving this goal despite this book. It is adequate in some ways but nowhere near as good as some of the other options. The only real bonus I can see is that the price is good."
2,My review,I didn't like the book at all. The book did not meet my expectations of a book about etymology. I have returned the book.
4,His Own Impressions,"Fantastic! Christian gives a guided tour of his own work process, and personal advice as a professional designer. It's like reading his diary, or suddenly finding yourself as his closest confidant and assistant designer! He shares his own impressions of himself and his work. He shares details of how his personal life and his career developed - even from childhood- what inspires him, and what are his influences. Four stars because it's not a quick reference: dates, sources, locations not readily found."
5,PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD,"I remember this series. It was brilliant. There was a song sung by a blonde homeless girl about her ""lost"" baby that I really, really want. Heck, the whole show was great."
5,I LOVED COP ROCK,"I absolutely loved Cop Rock. I can not understand how people could not understand that it was a MUSICAL. The concept was original, the music phenomenal, the acting dramatic and enthralling. I enjoyed the show very much and could not understand the criticism. What about ""West Side Story"",""Oklahoma"" or Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"". Do people not understand what a musical show performance is. I feel sorry for the people who could not grasp the concept. And I want to thank the creators for making a ending that was both enjoyable and complete. I repeat ""I Loved Cop Rock and can't wait to buy the DVD.THE WORLD IS READY-BRING IT TO CABLE- HELP START A MOVEMENT NOW!!!!"
3,Saw two songs on youtube and would be interested to see more.,"I saw two songs on youtube ""Guilty"" and ""Be Careful Out There"". I would like to see more now. With song competitions being the rage and Glee on the air. It would be interesting to see. Should be no issue to get the song rights from Randy Newman again. Let's do it."
4,"Well it's not Dragnet, but I liked it.","I hate to say this, but just as this show was finding it's pace, it was gone! As absurd as the consept of singing cops was, it was fun and I have to admit I loved seeing what actor could belt out a tune or not.Let's see this puppy on dvd!!!"
2,"Innovative, interesting, but was it any good?","I remember the show. I've had the pilot episode to Cop Rock since it first aired, and I've even watched it once or twice since then, and I don't think the show is as good as some might remember. It tried to be too many things at once, and while it was interesting to watch, it was difficult to actually LIKE, week-in and week-out. I think another reviewer said it best, it's Fame meets HillStreet Blues meets The Life - but it's not half as good as any of those. 2-stars for innovation and it's a wonder it ever got made."
4,how could i resist?,I plan to buy this DVD (if they ever actually release it) based purely on how utterly ridiculous this short-lived show was. Singing cops? What were they thinking when they cancelled this show???
5,Will giving a review of a non-existent item help it exist?,"I hope so! I loved this show, and I would buy this DVD set in a heartbeat, and I have never purchased a tv series on DVD. DVD's are so cheap to make, why wouldn't they take a shot, and make some money off this show?"
5,"If you never saw it, you should -","The fact that something as creative and innovative as this series could rank on a list of Worst TV Shows Ever is disgraceful, speaking volumes about reviewers, not the material. The quality of the musical numbers and the gritty drama was excellent, and if kept in separate shows, would certainly have worked. Initially that juxtaposition is jarring, but I found I could suspend disbelief after watching only 2 episodes, and fully appreciate the characters, scenarios and production.I would *absolutely* buy a copy if pressed onto DVD!"
4,"LAMOUR, FONDA AND BARRYMORE","In the thirties, all-star action melodramas didn't come much better than SPAWN OF THE NORTH, an eventful yarn of the war between Russian and American salmon-fishing fleets along the Alaskan coast. It was a winner for Paramount, which made several such big-scale mass entertainments in a period when other companies were scooping up all the Oscars and critics' awards. Even some of the reviewers enthused about the rugged vigour of Henry Hathaway's direction of this Barrett Willoughby story, scripted by Jules Furthman and Talbot Jennings. Performances pleased, too: Henry Fonda as the stalwart skipper, Dorothy Lamour as the gal who stands by him, defying the world, the flesh and the devil; George Raft as Fonda's pal (who goes over to the bad guys but thinks better of it). The great John Barrymore is great fun as a grizzled, guzzling newspaperman and Akim Tamiroff is good as the Russian heavy. Charles Lang's photography (the exteriors shot mostly in Alaska) was magnificent."
4,Excellent historical drama of trap fishing in Alaska,I enjoyed the authentic depiction of the challenges and dangers of fishing in Alaska in the thirties and earlier using fish traps. Some of the footage was on site and spectacular!
4,Black is the Colour of My True-Love's Heart,"Ellis Peter's mystery book are enjoyment to read. Amazon and various book dealers who provide me with so many books, many history books, over the years continue to get my orders because the service is always fast and the books in good to excellent condition."
3,An ok place to start,"As with most guidebooks, you can't really expect much depth in this one. I think the book errs in trying too hard to discuss political events and not enough on what the country's really like. It's not at all clear, in fact, that Mr. Ham actually ever visited the country.His political discussions are actually quite dated, even though the book same out only a couple of years ago. Much has changed since 2002, when the Saudis themselves were the victims of terrorist attacks. The country is planning its first nation-wide municipal, elections, for instance. This would come as a major surprise if you were to rely on this book alone.The book's not bad, but it's really for people who know nothing much about the country. There are better books available, particularly Thomas Lippman's ""Inside the Mirage"". That book, though longer, is actually easier to read."
4,Review of The Moon Is Broken,"In this very enjoyable book, the author, Eleanor Craig, who is also the mother of the main character tells the story of her relationship with her daughter, Ann. Eleanor did everything in her power to keep track of her daughter as she fell deeper and deeper into her heroin addiction. In the end, no matter how hard she tried, not even the devotion, and unconditional love that she gave could save Ann from herself. I believe that this story was an important one to be shared, and could benefit many different people, because it makes you realize that no matter how hard you try, you can't force somone to change. This story gives you a real life insight on many topics, including depression, anorexia, drug addiction, and AIDS, and their effects on a person's life."
5,Was a Collector's Item - available again!,"This CD was 75% produced by George Harrison and originally released by Apple Records in 1969, along with debuts by James Taylor, Jackie Lomax (see Is This What You Want - also produced by Harrison) & Mary Hopkin. Liner notes list Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker & Keith Richards among the players on this gem.A must for Beatles completists!!"
4,That's the way GOD planned it,"It was great to hear 4 of the great rock musicians of the 60's on the same track. Billy on organ, Eric on guitar, Keith on bass (also played bass with John Lennon at the Rock 'n' Roll Circus), Ginger on drums. The track seems raw, not well rehearsed, but natural. I enjoyed the whole CD."
3,pretty good set,"Billy Preston is One of the Baddest Organ Players in the Industry.vocally He has had some Moments. this set has some strong Instrumentation,but unlike on later Billy Preston Albums He doesn't really have alot of Knock Out Material. the Grooves are here&the title track is nice."
1,don't waste your time,"The crossbars that are supposed to ""lock"" in place pop out in your face at the slightest touch. This thing is of extremely poor quality! I could not even get it installed. Also, if you are going to use this for men's athletic shoes, which my husband happens to have a plethora of, you can forget it! Not enough room or near sturdy enough even if I could have gotten it to work. This is for very small shoes only. This is unfortunate, as i have been pleased with the line of Closetmaid products, and have all my closets outfitted entirely with their products."
1,Dissapointed.,"This was a great product with potential to be very useful to me and my husband. Unfortunately it feel short of our expectations. The cross bars where you hang the shoes were not strong enough to hold up my hiking boots and my husband sneakers. Also, the hardware used to hold the pole sections together was cheap and not able to secure the poles together. After putting it together and placing all our shoes on the rack it literally began bowing and bending along as the days passed. I will day that we did not act roughly with the shoe rack as the only time it was touched was placin shoes on and taking shoes off of the rack. All in all I would not reccomend this product at all.Note: the lack of confidence in how secure the poles were held together with the accompanying hardware was a bit disheartening as our 7 month old baby is learning how to stand and takes any opportunity to hold on to things to balance with. If you have infants this may not be the best shoe storage option."
1,A generous 1 star rating,"I gave this Shark iron 1 star only because I could not give it zero stars. I just used this iron for the first time and it worked extremely well (for the first 10 minutes). Beyond 10 minutes of use, the steam function failed. Not only did the steam fail but the iron began leaking like crazy leaving trails of water everywhere. My advice is definitely to save your money and a return trip back to the store. Go with the Black and Decker. A Consumer Reports Best Buy and worth every penny."
2,ok but grainy quality,"The quality was grainy, and it didnt really have any instruction, just how to massage a foot. No real information."
1,sucks up tone chinese junk,"I got this cable few years ago for 100 bucks at guitar center. It sucks up tone and ruins the true voice of your guitar and amp. Did well in the studio since its very quiet, but it really fails at live application. Returned it at guitar center and got a spectraflex cable that made my guitar tone as natural sounding and its half the price of this overpriced chinese made junk of a cable. at least the spectraflex is usa made and has a lifetime warranty like monster cables."
3,very lovely but not sturdy,"This is a lovely looking princess play hut but not very sturdy..when my daughters (age five and 21 mnths) tried to play in it, it fell on them..we tried to get it to stay up but when they crawled from one side to the other it wobbled..it was ok in the cabana style or as a hang out place but if your little ones like to really play, get on of the other tents that will probably be better..we returned it...."
1,Don't bother,"This is not the usual quality that Playhut stands for. The tent is held up by one plastic-corded pole that won't keep the tent upright. My daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses. The slumber bag is pretty, but the tent/tunnel is useless."
2,dissapointment,"This is a horribly dissapointing toy - there is no such thing as 5 in 1 - at least with this toy. My daughter was so excited when she first opened it, only to be let down in a major way (followed by a significant temper tantrum). It is impossible to figure out how to set up the tent & comes with very poor directions. The sleeping bag part of the toy now sits at the end of my daughters bed & the rest has been retired to the dump. Do not buy this!!!"
3,My daughter loves it but...,"This toy is really cute, but it definitely collapses rather easily when it is zipped closed like a tent. It seems to help if you connect the tunnel (one is included), but this will only help on one side. As others have said, the sleeping bag IS really nice. The whole unit does serve as a nice addition to the princess castle (also by playhut and VERY sturdy) and these two toys connect with the included tunnel. I certainly wouldn't say it's worthless, but playhut should really look at improving it. The sleeping bag is just too heavy to act as a side of the tent and weighs it down. My daughter still loves it though!"
1,the definition of one hit wonder,"Aside from the novelty hit ""New Age Girl,"" there is absolutely nothing on here worth hearing twice. Not quite rude enough to be punk, not quite smooth enough to be pop, a sort of lukewarm neither-nor 90's ""alternative"" act. Like most New Orleans rock bands, they have no definitive identity, and lapse into near-parodic regurgitations of their influences throughout. Probably best filed under ""Where Are They Now?"" ... Only for people who are strangely nostalgic for the mid-90's."
4,"Better than expected, and worth a listen","""New Age Girl"" really is the best song on this album, but I enjoy listening to the whole thing, which is rare. A decent band that made decent music, now defunct and now this album is out of print...sad, really. If you can get a copy, it's really worth trying out."
4,This cd kicks butt!!!,I used to have this tape but when I bought a cd player I couldn't find the cd anywhere!!! I am still looking for it and I finally found it online. This cd is awesome. I listen to it all the time.
1,Wrong item,If you order P212S4 and you receive P2D414. And someone is telling you that it's good for you. Then you can be sure that you are dealing with GOD. Because only GOD knows what's good for you.Do not buy from this seller.
4,True Cathy,"This book is true Cathy. All the humor that you are used to in her other books come through in this book as well. After the death of her father and all of life's other pitfalls Cathy learned how to laugh again. This book is for you if you have faced trails and are tired of sitting in a sea of tears. If you are ready to move on, this book will help you to do just that."
5,Celebrating It For Sure!,This Product is great. It gives me the answers to the all the questions that i have been asking myself. It tought me to give my wife better messages and she definitley deserves those. You cam tell this book has words of wisdom from god himself. I would recomend this book.
3,Grad School Disappointment,"We recently used this book in a graduate counseling class and many of us were, well, disappointed. The book is highly informative in many areas of sexuality; however, much of our class (especially the females) felt that there was an over-emphasis on ""pleasure"" (instead of exploring the spiritual components of sexuality) and that it was overly-stereotypical in much of its content. For a ""technique and sexual dysfunctions book,"" this is okay; if you want a much better book on the Celebration aspect of sexuality, read Dr. Gardner's book:Sacred Sex: A Spiritual Celebration of Oneness in Marriage"
3,Durable but color was not as depicted.,"The item is durable and meets my needs, but expected it to look better when sitting in den by fireplace."
5,Wonderful,"This is the best way to spend the evening with your children. It is very well done, and the actors made this a Neverland not to forget. We have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it, buy it, but most of all WATCH it."
5,amazing,"This film is absolutly fabulous! It is so cute. I dont think I have ever seen 2 actors with better chemistry, and these guys are only children! Beond 2 thumbs up, this is a must see for anyone who isnt afraid to be a little bit open to a lot of corny cheezy stuff."
5,Best adaptation of the book ever,"Sure, the cute little Disney version of Peter Pan is nice, but as far as sticking close to the wonderfully written original story, Disney's Peter Pan is terrible! This Peter Pan, starring Jason Issacs and Jeremy Sumpter, is the only Peter Pan movie I have seen that really sticks close to the book. Sure, there are some parts that are different and some that are left out, but as far as sticking to litarature, this movie comes pretty close. Not to mention, its great! The special effects are awesome and It's a great movie to watch with any one! I highly recommentd it"
5,GREAT!,"TERRIFIC MOVIE!THE SPECIEL EFFECTS ARE AWSOME!THEY GOT A GREAT ACTOR FOR TINKER BELL!SHE`S LIKE A FEMALE CHARLIE CHAPLIN!SO ANYWAY,THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT!"
3,Peter Pan - DVD FULLscreen - 2003,"The following review is repeated for the FULL screen DVD. The sound wasn't any better. Everyone else that didn't mention this in their reviews must be deaf.""Actually, my rating for the movie is 5 stars, but for the sound it's ONE star, that's why I gave it a '3 star':""""I was impressed with the movie - Jeremy Sumpter is an absolutely PERFECT Peter Pan - just a little dickens of a ""lady-killer"", devilish sweet smile - but NOT with the SOUND. The sound engineers, or SOMEONE, messed with it. When it started to be loud - the music to show excitement - THEY (the sound engineers, or SOMEONE) TURNED IT DOWN. Same with any yelling (excitement), by the children, the pirates, or Hook.""""VERY disappointing! I'LL control my sound thank-you-very-much!""The sound engineers should be VERY ashamed that they allowed this to go out like this!!! I am certainly EXTREMELY surprised, considering the MEGA sound engineers that were used on this film! Shame! on you for being so lazy."
3,Overall it's a good boy's movie,"This the classic story of Peter Pan. Very entertaining and not really anything offensive. There is some minor violence...and a scene showing a bullet hole in the chest of a pirate (who then drops dead). Overall it's a good boy's movie.The special features are actually better than the movie itself. Just be forewarned...there is a scene showing the painted-over breasts of the mermaids, in the feature about the mermaids. You might want to use parental guidance when your young boys get to that part of the speacial features. It is a very well made and enjoyable film though.*** Three and half stars"
3,Seen it a million times before,"The acting was good, the special effects were very good, but it just seemed like I've seen this a million times before and there really was no point in making this film. Much of the dialog seemed to be lifted right from the cartoon or the play. Personally, I liked the cartoon Disney version much better. There was more charm and personality in it."
2,"A disappointing ""kids"" movie","Because of some enthusiastic reviews, I decided to give this a try-what a mistake! This is definitely a ""kids"" movie and not a ""family"" movie. Much too frightening and violent for young children-would probably appeal best to older children and younger teenagers. As an adult, this did not hold my interest. I found the pace unbalanced, the special effects unimpressive, and the content very lacking. Much prefer the televised version which aired in the 60's!"
4,Peter Pan,"Our family rented this movie, and we loved it. My four year old wanted it for Christmas and still loves it. It is fun to watch and visually pleasing."
5,Peter Pan rocks my ... um... socks,"Great movie for anyone who can sympathize with a boy who can't grow up. Some dialog was not taken from Barrie's novel, but it fit in perfectly. ""Sir, you offend reason. I should like to offend it with you!"" Its a heartwarming family film featuring several young, nearly undressed, athletic boys. Some moments really layed the love story on thick, and even alluded to some inappropriate content (Peter and Wendy both look down, roughly in the area of Peter's midsection, then smile at each other). Either way, the DVD has an alternate ending that is less sad than the theatrical ending, but I prefer the original. Kids don't seem to appreciate as much as adults do, perhaps because a small amount of the language is complex (read: British). Overall a great film that brings out the kid in everyone."
3,Peter Pan - DVD Widescreen - 2003,"Actually, my rating for the movie is 5 stars, but for the sound it's ONE star:I was impressed with the movie - Jeremy Sumpter is an absolutely PERFECT Peter Pan - just a little dickens of a ""lady-killer"", devilish sweet smile - but NOT with the SOUND. The sound engineers, or SOMEONE, messed with it. When it started to be loud - the music to show excitement - THEY (the sound engineers, or SOMEONE) TURNED IT DOWN. Same with any yelling (excitement), by the children, the pirates, or Hook.VERY disappointing! I'LL control my sound thank-you-very-much!I will be trying the Full Screen, & if necessary the VHS version, to see if it's only in the DVD widescreen."
3,Adult Story About Kids...Or a Kids' Story About Adulthood,"I cannot decide which it is. Just as in the book, there are grown-up themes about what it means to grow up and take resoponsibility for one's feelings in this more-faithful retelling.My son is 5 and he enjoyed so much about it (especially the crocodile). But the whole girl/boy/feelings thing was just over his head enough to get him all worked up. He hid under the seat during much of that stuff....it was sort of comical, actually.Hook was nasty enough to be a bit scary. The Darlings were....well, darling. Peter looked so much like Peter that before this actor played Peter, he probably had people tease him about looking like Peter Pan. He was really effective. The set design was so real/fantastical that the mood was thoroughly captured. The element that did NOT strike true was Tinkerbell. She looked wrong, overacted, and was just the wrong kind of Tinkerbell.I liked it and so did my kids. Must be good, then, right?"
2,Dissapointing,"The previews looked amazing. Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) looked handsome and mischieveous, the perfect Peter. Rachel Hurd-Wood (Wendy) looked strikingly beautiful yet innocent. But that's just how it LOOKED.The movie followed the basic J.M. Barrie tale, about a boy who never grows up, flys, and lives in Neverland. Sumpter seemed good for the role, but when it came to acting...he just didn't cut it. Hurd-Wood was wonderful, charming and innocent as a girl with her first crush. But it was hard to figure out what made her so infatuated with Peter.Jason Issacs starred as both Mr. Darling, Wendy's father; and Captain Hook. He was the best thing in ""Peter Pan."" As Hook, he was witty and intelligent. He was a good actor, showing different facial expressions and proving the authority of Captain Hook. But he wasn't enough to save the movie.You're better off seeing the old Disney animated classic than this. Go ahead and rent that instead of seeing this!"
2,"try Robin Williams in ""Hook""","Well....my little cousin is doing a play on ""Peter Pan"", so she had to get inspiration. I told her to go a head and rent Robin Williams in ""Hook"". But no, she rents the new version, so I said ok I might as well watch it. I told her to take it back and get her money back from blockbuster. This is a terrible adaption to the Peter Pan story. First goes off as the acting, kids these days suck. This guys performances was worser than Elizabeth Berkley in ""Showgirls"". I mean the special effects have gone better, but this is just too bad. Too too bad actually.This is definitley the worst family film of 2003 next to ""Good Boy"". Please, if you want to show your kids a great family film, try toy story or pee wee's big adventure. Or if you want to show them a peter pan movie, its all about robin williams in Hook."
2,Decent far from exceptional,"My wife was dying to see this movie so I recently purchased it for her. Unfortunetly I had to sit threw an hour and a half of boring story telling. For children, they might enjoy this movie. The littler audience 2-6 probably wouldnt enjoy this film. There wasnt enough interesting moments in the movie. Most kids would probably loose interest in the first five minutes and continue to be bored throughout the first 20 minutes. This film does have some enjoyable comedy. But for peter pan, I would much rather watch hook a couple dozen times. But if you really enjoy the peter pan story you may very well love this move as my wife did. But if you loved hook you will not enjoy this movie because it is not as funny nor as interesting. All I can reccomend is rent it before you buy it."
2,They Still Haven't Gotten It Right,"I read this story as a child and saw the Disney version and unfortunately, this version was more action than the rather cerebral/Freudian book.First of all the special effects were incredibly cheesey and from ILM yet! Peter Pan moves way too fast for an entity weighing more than the bee he flies like. Didn't buy it. The trip to Neverland through outer space, didn't buy that either. Neverland was more like a place in a dream, a fourth dimention you might say.The same actor playing both Wendy's father and Captain Hook (who gets killed by Peter) and then there's nothing standing between the two. That's rather spooky and you can read into it what you want. I don't want to go there.This was better than the Spielberg disaster of 1991, but not much. Disney's cartoon version seemed to pass it on as what the author had in mind. Great music score though."
3,A Very Short Movie Review:,"Jeremy Sumpter plays the title role in ""Peter Pan"" this time, and does a credible job as the boy who wouldn't grow up (although he's no Robin Williams). Jason Isaacs plays Hook, and, although he's no Dustin Hoffman, he does adequately bring the villain to life. Ludavine Sagnier - who's no Julia Roberts - portrays Tinkerbell with a more mischievous bent than I was expecting. Richard Briers is underused as Smee, although he's no Bob Hoskins in any event.The movie is directed by P.J. Hogan, who's no Steven Spielberg."
3,Pan is just OK,"Peter Pan is ok. It isn't bad and it isn't good. There are no great things about this film other than the visual effects, which do not substitute for the flatness of the film and the lack of anything great. Jason Isaacs does an admirable job of portraying Captain Hook and Wendy's father.However, it isn't memorable enough to warrant seeing this film. While the movie does have its cute moments, they are few and far between.There have been better family films this year."
2,Not What Was Expected,"I took my 2 and 1/2 year old son to see this and was completely disappointed. We didn't even stay to see the end because it was very BLAH! It wasn't Peter Pan as I remember it. It was the child's version of a love story. Jason Isaacs was great, but the rest of the movie was terrible. The special effects were all right, but nothing spectacular. They looked fake. I would recommend renting this. It just isn't worth the $$$ for a matinee."
5,An Excellent Adaptation!,"I loved this movie! It really stayed with the storyline in J.M. Barrie's novel, but with a few wonderful extras. It was like the play comes to the bigscreen. I loved how the mermaids were portrayed, very creative. Jeremy Sumpter does excellent in his portrayal of Peter Pan, and his costume was very realistic. The soundtrack added to the magic and playfulness of the film. To see Peter and the Darling children fly the way they did was awesome and breathtaking. I can't stop watching this movie. I always felt that the story of Peter Pan was a love story between Peter and Wendy, and this movie reveals that with gentleness and wimsy. A wonderful movie all the way around."
5,pete pan 2003,"my grand daughter is in love with this movie. Shes 3 years old, so I bought it from amazon and I think she has watched it about 20 times. All the dvds I buy from amazon are just perfect. I tell everybody, just go to amazon.com amd you can find everything there. Thank YOu Carol Papcke"
5,MY FAVORITE MOVIE!,"Omg, I love this movie soooo much! It's my fav movie of all time, I am totally obsessed with this movie. I think my favorite thing about this movie is the romance between Peter Pan and Wendy (I wish they ended up together) and the fact that they can go to Neverland and don't want to grow up. This movie really made me not want to grow up. I'm 15, and I sooo don't want to grow up because it just gets worse (like school) from this age. Gotta watch this movie!!"
5,Well done!,"When I first saw this in the movie theater, I loved it. It was very interesting and the special effects were great. It was much better than I thought it would be, quite a bit different from the cartoon! It makes an especially great family movie seeing as there isn't much fighting or violence."
4,The cleaverness of PJ Hogan,I'm sorry I missed this in the theater. This film is so much better than most of the stuff that's out there. The thing is I loved it and will have to have the DVD for my collection.
1,Awful!,"they should not have relased a new version of the oringinal.peter pan 2 and this one stink.take my word for it,i'm glad i got it through pay per view insted of buying the vhs,dvd,or seeing it in theaters."
2,A Complete Unknown,"Yeah, I didn't see this movie. And, I don't know anyone that saw this movie. I don't know anyone that has any sort of opinion on this movie one way or the other. It got completely unnoticed. There isn't anyone the slightest bit famous in it. So I wouldn't waste my time with it."
4,not your bedtime story peter pan,"Peter pan has always been one f my favorite fairy tales. Maybe because it s full of fantasy & wonder & beauty. Yet not a mamsy pansy story. It was meant as a grand adventure. It was meant for us to get just a bitt scared in places. This is the best film adaptation of that intention!Not for the little kiddies mom. There is betrayel, death, insecurities and cold blooded murder. Insecurities? Yes like the rest of us peter pan has insecurities even issue though he'd never admit it. It ends happily for most. Like most mens minds I can't spak for him too complicated.I would highly recomend this film but not to the very young, simply for content. It's a beautiful; poetic thinking version. very visual & vivid with excelent dialoge. definatly a keeper."
3,Sound Issues,"The film itself is beautiful. However, there are sound issues with the DVD. The music cuts out/is lowered abruptly on a few occasions. For the price, I'm not complaining, but I'd definitely purchase a better product if it were available."
5,Possibly the most well-done film in centuries.,"A great film for Adults and Children. It is played so well with Jeremy Sumpter and Jason Isaacs they both worked hard to feature such a thrilling film. P.J Hogan has done a splendid job of working with the actors, a great film to watch by all. I must say Jeremy Sumpter is such a great young actor, handsome, living and makes you feel the story of Peter Pan come true.My favourite."
4,My Most Favorite Movie,"In my opinion, the Peter Pan movie is the most fantastic fantasy movie I've ever seen, beating The Lord Of the Ring and Harry Potter in my personal record as I've seen it more than 130 times, while LOR or HP less than 100 times.This Peter Pan version is the version I'd wished to see, the romance between Peter and Wendy. Not to mention how cute both Jeremy and Rachel were, what a lovely couple!"
4,The Boy Who Never Grew Up,"This is a wonderful movie adaptation of the favorite novel Peter Pan. It really is a shame, that the movie didn't do well in box office, because it really is a good family movie.The graphics are very good and aren't way over the top like a lot of movies are. The back ground music is very beautiful and fits the story well.Jeremy Sumpter as a very beautiful and rich looking Peter Pan really fits and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wending Darling really paces the mood at the begging of the story.The cast really complement each other and the full package is great to watch."
4,"i do beleive in great movies, i do i do","this movie was quite a blow. in the good way. i loved how both the kid and adult actors acted. i think jeremy sumpters and rachel wood did a extraordianry job. keep up the good acting! the only little hting that bothered me is how they twisetd aroudn the plot a bit, other than that...AWESOME PERFORMACE:D"
5,Great family entertainment!,"My daughter loves this movie and has been asking for it for a while, checking local stores I was surprised to see it priced higher than in Amazon."
5,EXCELLENT FAMILY FILM!,We didn't see it in the Movie Theater... so we decided to buy it... WE'VE WATCHED IT 7 OR 8 TIMES SO FAR!!!!!IT IS THE BEST VERSION OF PETER PAN EVER! The CGI work in the film is AWESOME!!! The music is BEAUTIFUL! The characters are ROCKAGE!!! AND IT IS SOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY LIKE THE BOOK! It's just WOW!Do not mistake this movie for a Disney Film... Disney would've killed it... UNIVERSAL ALL THE WAY!!If You haven't bought/rented/viewed it... YOU SHOULD!!
5,fabulous,This is the best version of this classic that I have ever seen.The casting and directing are flawless. My 3 year old daughter and I cannot get enough of this DVD.
5,Great,This is my eight year old granddaughters favorite movie. She had watched it five times before I bought this for. She was so excited.
4,family friendly movie,It is fun to remember being a kid again... where one's imagination knew no limits. A family favorite tale told in a fun way to be enjoyed by a wide audience. Keep in mind it is a kid friendly film so it will be cheesy but if you know that going into the film then I think you will enjoy it more.
3,It's Peter Pan,Peter Pan is true to Barrie's book. It's an ok adaption. The special effects are the best part of the movie. The worst part is Tinker Bell. She made me wish for Julia Roberts from Hook.
3,Peter Pan,"There are some things that I really love about this movie. I love Jason Isaacs as Hook, I've always loved the story, and I like it that this is a bit darker than the other versions of Peter Pan. They really have a chance to show Peter as a real person, with feeling and emotions, instead of just an always happy little boy.But this movie is flawed from the beginning. It is entirely too childish for most adults to enjoy, and children will like the cartoon version better and will not understand many of the jokes and conversations. It seems the perfect live action Peter Pan movie can never be made."
2,"PETER PAN Can, but Didn't","Written over 100 years ago, the latest version of PETER PAN is said to be closer to the original story than the beloved Disney film. There has been several retellings over the years, but this one just didn't get off the ground with me. Seeing a half naked boy flying around with a ferry and trying to kill people seemed more creepy than cool. It also takes far too long to get to the meat of the film, and then seems to end shortly thereafter. That being said, the audience couldn't disagree more. ""Excellent,"" ""amazing,"" and ""great,"" were the words by the patrons as they left the screening. So once again, don't take my word for it. However, I believe that they may all agree that if you are going to see a pirate movie this winter, rent PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL was one of the few films to come out of 2003 that over-delivered!"
1,Shoulda been called Jason Isaacs: The Movie,"It was lame. It was stupid. Jeremy Sumpter was terrible. The child nudity was unnecessary. The only time I enjoyed myself was when Jason Isaacs was on screen. He was the best thing about the movie. And there were plenty of awesome one liners that were ruined by the next of dialogue like, ""That was no thimble."" Terrible movie all around. That's all I can say."
1,they ruined my Peter's image..,"Peter Pan in this movie..is too..too normal boy.Too much feeling, and just pretend to hide it.In the original tale, his feeling to Wendy..is not this way..I think.Actually, I think Peter's heart is quite cold instead.(although he is a kind of good boy)Too much feeling of ""romantic"" movie."
1,Book and Movie don't sync up,"I read the book about two weeks before I saw the movie. Let me tell you, If it wasn't for the same basic plot and some of the characters being the same I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be the same. Added characters, added scenes, and changed scenes. What was the screen writer thinking? Maybe if I had never read the book it would have been a good movie. The only good thing about the movie was some of the children's reactions in the theatre. It was a lot darker than previous pan movies. One child exclaimed ""They can't do that"" as peter was slammed onto the rock by hook. Save your money and make it a rental unless you havn't read the book or you're sure it won't bother you if everything is kinda off."
5,This is Peter Pan like you've only imagined before!,"What a perfect movie! This is the beloved children's story that I think has never truly been done justice until now. The movie is perfectly cast, perfectly acted, and the soundtrack is the most magical music you've ever heard. Every scene will draw you more into this lovely story. With a slight twist on the friendship between Peter and Wendy, and amazing special effects, this story comes to life in a way that only the magic of film-making can accomplish. This is not just a children's movie! Families and couples everywhere can appreciate the magic spell cast by ""Peter Pan."""
5,Child's Eye View,"Without a touch of sentimentality, Hill shows us the child's eye view of the grieving process and ends her story on a life-affirming note. Children and adults alike will appreciate this heart-warming book."
3,The Bug Cemetary,"This was an odd book about children who made a bug cemetery. When they found dead bugs, they would have funerals for them and pretend to cry. Then one little boy's cat died. They buried Buster the cat in the Bug Cemetery, but they cried real tears. Then they decided funerals were no fun and they planted a garden there instead."
2,Highly disapointed,Not being a customary complainer. I feel compelled to take the time in this case:Highly disappointed with the test analysis service. Alpha Energy Labs who First Alert engages to analyze and return the test results appears incompetent and irresponsible in the timely examination and returning of test feedback.I do not recommend this product to others. Without effective and efficient test analysis management the product becomes a waste of money.
1,Complete ripoff,"1) Wasted the purchase price. 2) Wasted the postage to mail it 3) Waited 3 weeks and absolutely nothing. The web site is constantly down and then I am told that maybe the mail is late. Absolutely a waste of more than $20 and more so the time to find out the test. I should never have bought this bogus kit. This is not a first alert product, it is a small company that clearly can barely run a business."
5,good economy short term test.,"I've used 6 of these for three buildings.I've detected one location with a very high reading,and two others that exceed standards.The process works fine although the printed forms could be handier.Why pay more?"
5,Great product - quick results,"This is a great product, and the price include the lab cost wich can be around $25-$30. I did the test, and then send it to the lab in the enclosed envelope. My only additional cost was postages. I got the result via e-mail quick, which is very good. If you are buying a house and you are in a time crunch, and you want to test it for radon, this is the best way to go... I did this for my peace of mind even though the readeings in the area were very low.Thank you,Victor"
1,Never heard the results,Sent the sample in & never heard back from them - very disappointed - not the usual Amazon quality - hope this gives them a kickstart
3,Consider an electronic detector instead,"I wasted lots of dollars and time with these one-time testers, and waiting for the test results. I since got a Safety Siren Pro electronic radon detector, and wish I had at the outset.These presumably work as advertised, but it's nice to be able to get results in 48 hours, and to track readings, as well as to test different rooms, and different seasons.Buy a one-time test only if you are darn sure you won't need to do more testing."
1,instructions are contradictory - any help?,"The box says to place the kit in the testing location and leave it there for two to three days.The instructions inside say to leave it for no more than 48 hours, though the minimum amount of time is not clear (12 hours?), nor is the optimum amount of time - to get the best results.i am annoyed and do not know how to proceed."
1,LOWER RATED OF BRANDS,This kit was rated 2nd to LAST in Accuracy and Reliability.I would suggest saving your money and buy a Top Rated Brand Kit.
1,Do not Buy This,Lousy service. I submitted the sample per their instructions and never got the results. Got taken I guess.
5,Great Product & Very Fast Results,"I was a little hesitant to purchase this test kit. Since I have Prime, it shipped for free so I decided to take a gamble. We have new granite countertops & a few weeks after installation, someone questioned whether I researched radon in granite countertops. I had not researched this aspect of granite countertops prior to installation. Since I have two small children, this really worried me. I bought this kit & set it up in the middle of the kitchen when we were out of town for a couple of days. We came home, shipped it off on 7/8/09 with 4 stamps & had the results via e-mail on 7/13/09. We were very happy with the quick service & even happier to know our kitchen has a below average amount of radon being emitted.According to the results, the U.S. indoor average is 1.3 pCi/L, and the outdoor average is 0.3 pCi/L. Our level was 0.8 pCi/L.I would recommend this kit to anyone concerned about home radon emissions."
1,never received results,"This was very easy to use, however I never received my results. It doesn't look like the odds of getting your results are all that high. Something to keep in mind."
5,Fast and easy,"Easy to understand instructions, and the results can be emailed back to you. I got mine 3 days after I mailed it. 2.6 pci/L, which is well below the amount that requires action. Weird thing is that they said I could download the results of the test off of a website, but the link was an IP address with a port of 81. I didn't need to access the web page to get the results, since they were already attached to the email."
4,Get your results online,"My results never arrived by mail, two+ months later.However, I was perusing other reviews and saw a comment that results can be seen online. You will need your test number and zip code. The URL is [...]It took about five seconds to download my results report. The report in a nice format, great for saving in case we ever sell the home."
1,Wildly inconsistent results means useless product,"I bought one of these to test my basement, as I've noticed that several of my neighbors now have a radon mitigation system added to their house. The 1st test kit registered 9.8 pCi/L - way above normal. So I ordered another kit (just in case), placed it in the same spot, same amount of time, etc., and the results of this test was <0.5 pCi/L. Jeez, from one extreme to the other. I guess they want me to buy a third kit to get the ""actual"" results. Any test that varys this much, amounts to a useless test kit. Look else where if you want to test your house for radon."
1,Buy something else.,"Easy to use, but useless and a waste of money (for two!!!) because they never send the results. I can't recommend this to anyone."
5,quick and easy,"This test kit was quick and easy to use. I liked that the lab testing was included in the purchase price, the envelope to mail to the lab was included and only required two first class stamps. (No trips to the post office.)I received the report very quickly via email."
1,"bad instruction, unreliable service","bad instruction, unreliable service. I have to read other people's review to know that they will not inform you and you suppose to figure out results yourself."
4,"worked well, results available online","This worked well, as the reading I got compared almost exactly to the reading obtained on a more expensive electronic radon meter. The radon specialist who came out to the house to talk about reduction methods accepted the First Alert results as fact. Good for a first test of suspected radon."
5,Quick and Easy,"We recently purchased a new home, and the inspector tried to sell us an inspection for $150. Instead I got on Amazon and we located this kit.The kits came quickly, as always, and we set them up easily (basically just open and write down the time). We mailed them off and had them fax the return back to us. Received the results within less than 10 days."
3,Not a precision kit,I ordered two kits at the same time. The results for the first one came back from the lab about 3 weeks after I sent it. My basement measured 8.2 pCi/L. The second one came back at 5.5 pCi/L it also took three weeks. I had my house treated based on these results and the company I hired tested with their professional meter at 0.5 pCi/L after the service was complete. I will buy another one of these kits to see how well it tested after the treatment and how it compares to the two initial tests I did. There was a decent about of variability between the 8.2 and 5.5 readings.....would recommend doing at least two.
1,Do not purchase this test kit,"This company lost the first test we sent them. After repeated attempts to contact their customer service, they finally agreed to send us a second test kit. It's been over a month and a half since we placed this order and we still don't have the second test kit. I will update this review if the company ever delivers a test kit and the results are actually produced, but at this point I have zero confidence in any test results the company provides since they've proven so unreliable up to this point. Don't go through this company."
1,Did not get results - waste of money,"This may be a good product, but we followed the instructions exactly and the lab claimed that they didn't receive the kit within the time allotted. We mailed the test kit the day we completed the test. The post office had plenty of time to deliver it, I believe the lab received it in time and was over-committed.There is no recourse...we lost $13, plus shipping."
3,Happy with results,My results were excellent and I am happy. However I had to look them up to find why my results didn't arrive in a timely maner. Then I corrected my mistake but they should have sent me an eMail. Everything worked out but I didn't get good customer service.
2,Bad instructions,"The instructions state to use two first class stamps. The envelope said to use five. I should have used five, I followed the instructions and it got returned to me. Unfortunately with MLK day and the weekend now I'm over 10 days so by the time it would get there it would be invalid.The other problem is that the card you print your information on is unnecessarily small. I don't see why they can't make this larger (perhaps a full piece of paper) and give me more space to enter my information.The kit is good and the idea is of decent quality. But after this mess I'll probably just buy an actual detector. If I did this again I'd make sure the test started on a Saturday morning and ended on Monday morning and I'd take it to the post office counter."
1,Never received results.,I followed all the directions and never received results. Can't get a hold of the company to ask about it. It's been a few months. Save you money and get a different test kit.
3,Questionable packaging,"Good for the price. However, we had widely varying results with the two tests -- one high, one very low. I suspect the return envelop may be to blame for the high result. When sealing the envelop with the sample inside, the envelop cracked when I pressed to seal it. It is made of paper, not plastic. So, on the second sample, I put the charcoal box in a sandwich ziplock bag, then in the return envelop."
5,"Work well, got the same number as what the home inspector got","Work well, got the same number as what the home inspector got.And the results came back in time.I got a spare. Will check the value again in a couple month."
1,No Results,"Total waste of money. A month in and no results. Better off just doing radon.com - costs a bit more, but at least they do what they're supposed to. There are enough reviews that are ""no results"" - I gambled on not being one of those - and lost. Amazon should pull the product."
2,Radon Kit Review,I can't review the kit because I never got the results back from the lab. It has been one month since the test was mailed.
5,ECW? A must buy game!!!,"When I heard that the ECW brand would be present on this game for the first time, I had to buy this and it wasn't a waste of money either! The game for the first time feature's Extreme rules matches where you can find all kinds of stuff, and set them on fire!!! Remember when you were playing a ladder match and only one ladder was present? Athing of the past! Now two ladder's are present for ladder matches for extra fun, and extremeness. The story modes are great and it feature's legends as all ways. Overall 5/5 for fun and E...C....W!!!!!!!"
2,same thing,All the smackdown vs raw are the same thing i mean come on theirs nothing different about this game they just took out some characters and the story mode sucks really bad you can't really play just the computer 07 was the same but the best one
2,Change is bad!,Okay i love wwe games but come on THQ leave the freakin' controls alone! Every game we have to learn a diffrent control system that really takes the fun out of the game. Yea u can have great graphics and cool music (not the rap)but having to press 6 buttons just to move is dumb! 08 could have been the best but thanks to a very difficult and stupid control system you have now made my wallet and pride hurt! I knew i should i have got cena's dvd instead!@#@ Anyways Lets all thank THQ for a bad idea to change the controls again. Buy the game if you love wwe but buy a gun too so u can shoot yourself when Rey mysterio keeps beating you up cause you can't move right!
2,oops i did it again,If you are big into video games you will love this. If you are an average player the controls in this game do not work anything like the last smackdown vs raw. That is where I have the problem. You have different punch and kick buttons that take time to get used to. I wish that all video game makers would get together and make a standard for which buttons punch and kick. You can still have different combo's with all the rest of the buttons and joysticks on the controller but keep the same basics. I am still getting used to the changes and I am not sure I like the changes yet.
2,as bad as WWE has become lately,"crappy roster, slow loading times, dumb angles in the story mode, terrible move controls, its almost impossible to do a reversal cause the opportunity flashes for half a second and in video game time it just doesn't work, it takes a tremendous effort to take the belt off the hook in the ladder match which makes it very frustrating, its hard to make tags, commentary gets old quickly...i could go on....they should make a game where the WWE world is free roaming and you choose your allies, enemies, your angles, etc...and then the computer puts their input based on your choices...I hate being forced to fight people when I don't want to and I HATED that Rowdy Piper came back and turned on me as a tag team partner - what purpose does that hold in 2008 - if I am Triple H why is Piper beating my a** and making me look like a loser??? maybe Kamala can come back too and feud with triple h in the next version, that would be just as smart..."
2,Poor roster and complicated controls....,"Just got the game for the PS2.. Really disappointed that the controls have changed... Why did the developers change the controls from the previous game which had better controls... Damn i'm pissed.All in all, i think this is the worst Smackdown game ever released... One of the worst rosters too and the complicated controls just sums it all up... Where is Deuce and Domino? Jimmy Wang Yang? Kevin Thorn? Big Daddy V? And many many others who are in the WWE now???? Just disappointed.As for the controls, anyone knows how to drag an opponent who is on the ground? Everytime i wanna pin him, i get rope break.. With the new controls, i have no idea how to drag the opponent.... Please help..."
