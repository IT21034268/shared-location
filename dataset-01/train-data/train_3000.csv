4,"Sick, disturbing, repulsive. You can't put it down.","I bought this book because I read a review of it in which the reviewer stated that he hated this genre, and wanted to hate the book, but felt that the writing was so good it trumped the subject matter. I almost had to put the book away, as the descriptions of the violence were so unsettling, but found myself drawn back because the writing was so incandescent. This book is definitely not for the squeamish, but I would recommend it nonetheless because of the author's faultless ear for dialogue and great storytelling."
4,"Haunting, Chilling, Heart-pounding...","William Diehl recommended this book to me after he read an advance copy several months ago. I put the book on reserve with Amazon and it arrived last week... I honestly couldn't put it down and finished it in about six hours. It'd make a terrific movie - something Sam Peckinpah would have delighted us with. Like other reviewers, the images of the book's characters keep flashing thru my head. I was going to loan it to a neighbor, but I think I'll read it again..."
1,NY Times reviewed some other book,"Most of the action happens somewhere outside the story and is described to a man by several different people. It feels remote and uninvolving. Why does each character sound like they are auditioning for a Stephen King reading? People in the real world don't speak like this. Why do the characters in the story talk so much, maybe because, since there is no action, there has to be talk to fill up page after page. The deeper I got into this book the less I liked the writing. The final straw was a sentence that went ""They ran a couple sentences around each other. Nothing special."" How lazy is that?"
2,Not memorable,"It is an O.K. book. Not memorable. I kept huffing and puffing midway through the book because I had already figured out the plot, which is obvious at that point. It kept dragging, and dragging, and dragging. But I had to finish it because that's just the type of girl I am.True suspense books are suspenseful until the end. This one isn't."
3,"The content was dumb, but the story was somehow engrossing.","This book posed a conflict for me; I was disappointed by the stereotype punks, cops, and junkies, and found a lot of the dialog flat-out stupid. In addition, I thought the copy was poorly edited... Yet, I couldn't wait to get to the next page and see what would happen. I hate to admit that I really enjoyed reading this book."
5,"Riveting, mesmerizing, beautifully written.","It has been some time since a book has affected me as has this one. I cannot let go of the place, the time, the desperation, the raw and gritty down-in-the-vein-ness that is this story. I cannot let go of Case, who speaks to a part of me that I do not often address, and am, I guess, sometimes loathe to acknowledge. I came to the end, and started over again. Boston's use of language is rich and passionate and poetic; filled with rhythm,intelligence,feeling. Part of me wants for his next effort, if there is one, and part of me wants there to be no other. How to top this effort? But I sense that he will, and I pray that he does, and I so want him to because of my selfish need to feel this thing he has caused me to feel, all over again. Maybe I'm just a literature junkie."
4,Interesting but a downer....,A pretty good first novel but what a grim view of a side of life I am glad I not involved in. Compelling and strange with a resolution that seemed too pat. It was hard to put down although. :)
3,Boring.,"I bought this expansion with high expectations, as I enjoyed Icewind Dale better than either Baldur's Gate of Baldur's Gate II. However, it did not live up. The areas are just plain boring - there is one area where there is only ONE ENEMY that you fight, and the rest aren't much better. Also, be prepared for LOOOONG sequences of dialogue with barbarians... again, not my idea of an ideal game. Fortunately, Black Isle released Trials of the Lurmaster as a free download for HoW owners (...), so that at least means it gets a three. Other than that, the higher level cap and even Heart of Fury mode (which does little more than make battles extremely tedious ) do little to make up for a mediocer experience."
2,not worth the money,"As a diehard fan of CRPGs, and especially of BG1, BG2, and Icewind Dale I was sorely disappointed in this expansion pack. Unlike Tales of the Sword Coast, which proved to be a challenge, my ""final save"" party from IWD breezed through this easily. I finished this expansion pack on the second day. Sure there were some graphic improvements and higher experience levels, but this thing was nowhere near worth..., not for just the few quests that you get for it. The boss, or ""foozle,"" or whatever you might call him, was a disappointment, too, much less difficult than similar monsters in BG2. If you have unlimited funds, go for it, but I would say that you should wait for it to show up in the bargain bin."
3,Too Short,It's a good game but much too short to be worth the price. I played it in about 20 hours. They speak of going up to 30th level but you would be hard pressed to do that unless you start the game at 25th level. You can count on going up 4-6 levels that's about it. Cut the price in half or add twice the content and you would have a five star game.
3,"Another ""too short"" review","If this expansion were ... cheaper I would go up a star. The fixes to the original engine were outstanding. If you haven't already played Icewind Dale and are playing it for the first time with the expansion, you'll get a lot more for your money. For those who already completed I.D. and are hungry for more, I don't think this will calm your hunger. It's more like a snack than a meal. The bonus missions were a lot of fun, but were brief and simple. At least one extra long term quest would have been appreciated after shelling out ""my money"". My advice: wait for the price to go down."
3,"Fun, but...","The expansion was really fun, Icewind dale was great, Heart of winter was interesting, EXCEPT that it was incredibly short. They set the experience caps to level 30, and playing on hard mode I took my level 11s and 12s (imported) to level 16-17... I beat the game in 2 hours. It would take AGES to get to 30. 5000000+ exp.It's good, But extremely short. If you want something more satisfing, Baldur's gate 2 is pretty good. Pretty long."
2,"""Somewhere in Snora""","John Wayne once remarked that producer Leon Schlesinger's cartoons ""were better than the horse operas he put me in."" The Duke was probably referring to ""Somewhere in Sonora"" (1933) - one of his weakest Warner/Vitagraph Westerns. Wayne's youthful presence, Ted McCord's cinematography and a good supporting cast (including Henry B. Walthall, Paul Fix and Glenn Strange) are the best aspects of this dull ""B"" programmer. More action and far less comic relief would have helped. If you want embryonic Wayne, stick with ""Haunted Gold"" or ""The Big Stampede."""
3,Early Wayne Western,"In the early days of sound movies, B westerns were very popular, with hundreds being made every year. John Wayne started his career in these films, making about one a week. The movies were about the same-plot, production value, and script being almost interchangeable between them. To my taste, these films are a pleasent way to spend an hour or so(they are all about an hour long). I know that many will disagree with me, but if I have a spare hour I wii watch one."
5,Wonderful,Truly a amazing CD!!! This is the first time I bought this artist CD and I became a instant fan. She is truly anointed by God a must hear!!!
5,A Must Read!,"This book made me laugh until I cried! It doesn't matter what age level you teach, this book will keep you and the rest of the teacher's lounge in stitches. Every story is so true to life. You are able to replace a name or item, and it is your classroom situation. A must read for all teachers!"
5,Amazing Book,"I came across this book years ago as a student teacher, and it is still my first line of defense for a bad day. At this point, I have given it as a gift to most of my teacher friends, and we share knowing smiles when our students display the truths that Philip Done has so beautifully described."
5,One of my favorite books,"This is pretty much what teaching a class of third graders is like! I've been teaching for 14 years, and Mr. Done's take on 3rd graders is right on. It's so funny, especially if you've lived it. If you are a teacher, know a teacher, or want to know what teachers go through in a humorous way, this book is for you."
5,Great for anyone who works with children,"Even if you're not any kind of teacher, you know these kids, were these kids or have these kids. I can't wait to share it with my teaching co-workers. I work with toddlers and can already see some of the personalities of the children in this book. I only wish my own children could have had Mr. Done."
5,All teachers will appreciate this book!,This is a terrific and fun book for all teachers to read. Just terrific!!
5,My thoughts EXACTLY!!!!,"This book is the best voice for teachers I've ever heard. It's as if Mr. Done was writing my thoughts. The chapter on speeches and letters he would write to parents were verbatim for me.This book gives the best insight on how teachers feel and think during the year from beginning to end. I've read the book 3 times in one weekend and I've found something new each time.The introduction is touching. It describes to a ""T"" what a teacher is and more. It showed that teaching is more than just passing along knowledge. It is being the nurse, doctor, shrink, comedian etc.Now when people ask me why I like being a teacher I tell them to read this book. It gives just and brief glimpse at what my job means to me and why I do it.Thank you Mr. Done for finally putting into words what I have been feeling for the past 8 years.Oh, by the way, 6 of those 8 years was as a 3rd grade teacher."
5,Great Summer Read!,"This book is absolutely hysterical, especially for teachers like me! Done paints the picture of what it is really like to be in our profession; it's truthful, yet inspiring. I found myself saying, ""That is so true!"" aloud almost every page. It's perfect to take to the pool or beach for a quick, entertaining read!"
1,waste of money,"Buy any other gun, but do not waste your money on this one. I did use it for about 3 months and I was completly dissappointed. It jamed often and was unable to drive 2"" nails into oak at pressure about 120psi. Instead, leaves a nail out and punch another hole next to that nail. If you work with a stain grade materials...get better gun."
1,floydcramercd,the cd from amazon is useless! i put my music in computer to enjoy. the cd has a piracy coding that does not allow me to load to computer. i will not purchase cd's again
4,"LOOKIN' GREAT, MINNESOTA","M is for Minnesota, by Debra Chial, makes this reader eager for a trip up north to put myself in those enticing photographs. From A to Z, we see the state at its most beautiful and its most fun; plus, we get a bit of history and facts as well. This would be an excellent book to read to a pre-schooler, or for a early to mid grade schooler's homework project. If one has a personal connection to Minnesota, or has a need for information about the highlights of our 32nd state, this book will fill the bill. Set up in alphabet format, one gorgeous photograph and simple fact on each page, it is appropiate for reading to preschool children. For older kids, maybe up to age 10 and ready for more information, there are two pages of ""Quick Facts"" relating to the highlights, at the beginning of the book. It would have been helpful had the author listed the page numbers to which these facts pertained, although they are in some order of occurence."
2,Mediocre at best,"This is an OK songbook but it is not really arranged for ukulele. The chords and chord diagrams are good but the melodies are not arranged for ukulele. Fewer than 10 of the 30 songs can have the melody played on a soprano ukulele without transposing the music, some of the notes are below the instrument's range. It does have great songs, but I would recommend it more for guitar."
3,good not perfect,a good book maybe not the best for beginners. w/o a cd/dvd to assist you really cant know what your efforts are producing. unless you read music
3,not very good sound quality,"The device works ok, but the sound quality is not what I expected.When I plugg in my guitar directly to the Amp, it sound way better than pluggin it first to the mixer."
1,Very poor sound quality ... avoid,"I was piping music directly into a pair of old Mackie SRM450s from an E-Mu 0404 hooked up to my laptop. Sounded pretty decent for entry level equipment.Then we decided to have a woman talking over the music. So we put this .. thing ... between the 0404 and the Mackies, and plugged a Shure SM57 mic into line 1.Her voice came out of the Mackies so muffled that i sounded like she was talking through a pillow. Completely lost the high end on the music I was playing. Getting good enough sound required turning up the Hi EQ knobs all the way up, and the Lo EQ knobs all the way down on both the Line 1 input and the main outs.Behringer makes good enough amps and their DSP equipment is a category price/value leader, but they can't do cheap analog mixers with decent sound quality."
4,Lessen guilt and get a better understanding,I am currently in the beginning stages of a divorce. Married my best friend and was married 5 years. Nothing really went wrong with the marriage other than just we grew a apart. I have been feeling guilty about getting a divorce dealing with all the feelings that go along with it but this book helped. I am not a big book reader but I finished it 2 nights. And now I am going to share it with my spouse.
4,Cookbook,"My mother had this. I got this one as a present. It's got all the 'old-world' recipes. I haven't tried them all, but it's got what I want."
2,Low Quality/Overpriced/Beware of Seller,"Anyone familiar with current Teac branded products knows they are a far cry from the old reel-to-reel tape recorders that made the Teac name famous. This is understandable. The Teac EQA220 Equalizer is overpriced. You can easily find this exact same unit at 30% less than it is advertised for here and get free shipping too. And a word to the wise about Discountjungle...it's a jungle out there! If you want to return an item to this company they charge you a 15% restocking charge on the cost of the item AND the shipping charge. Of course you pay the return shipping too. Buyer Beware when your're dealing with ""The Jungle."""
5,Great Puzzle with one limitation,"Great puzzle. Fairly hard, though it comes with a ""cheat sheet"" for those who want to skip the frustration. Only downside to the puzzle that I can tell is the pieces are all a sort of hard cardboard (or paperboard). Suggest spraying lightly with puzzle adhesive once complete, and a water-proofer spray to cover that afterwards if piece is to be used as a display near possible liquid spills. Decently heavy for all that, as the puzzle is nearly 150 layers."
3,Relaxation Therapy for Children,"This CD has a nice selection of pieces that are very calming. However, the entire CD is performed using a synthesizer and thus lacks much in performance."
3,impression,"i thought it was gonna be an sense stimulating chocolate covered trip. i guess i got my expectations too high because when i got the album, i wasn't that impressed and a little disappointed.i think groups like pizzicato five, bis, and even deee-lite have already done what these guys are doing, and probably better. i'm not trying to totally slam this album though. it is a light, upbeat dance music album that would probably work good as backround music at a party or while you are cleaning the house... my favorite songs in that case would be ""speeding down the highway"", and ""we love to rock"".i think its only mildly fun and the plastic taste leaves you wanting some more substantial musical food. it won't leave a lasting impression."
3,Good Enough for a Few Spins,"Think of the German synth duo Yello from the 80's on speed for the late 90's. You get the gist. While this disc has been called everything from an artistic kitschy feat to a...beverage coaster by other reviewers, you can be sure it is anything but dull or mundane. The tracks are very much in the musical techno vein of Euro-Japanese dance music with a 60's retro lounge throwback sound. While it's not exactly Moby or ATB (which many still question ATB's popularity) it's a casual groovy listen. It doesn't break any new techno or ambience territory, but hey, neither did disco...In a few years, even this recording will sound dated and by then who knows what the latest club trend sounds will be...Enjoy it for the moment..."
1,Instant beverage coaster...simply awful.,"BUYER BEWARE! Based on all the positive reviews of this album, I decided to jump in and try it. I was terribly disappointed. This is just a bunch of blips and beeps that sound like they came right out of a Casio keyboard with what sounds like Japanese girls yelling ""We love dancing! Yay!"" over and over again. The music is totally inane, riddiculous, uninventive, unappealing, non-melodic, and tiresome. It remids me of a soundtrack to a second rate Japanese childrens' video game. Even if you can get into the kitsch appeal of this release more than I could, I highly doubt this is a title that will stand up to repeated listening. I have an extensive music collection of over six-thousand CD's spanning nearly every genre, and this one honestly rates among the worst I have ever purchased. Pass on this one!"
4,An invaluable help,"Noel Hume compiled this wonderful treasury of ceramics mostly from his personal collection. This book is invaluable in my Colonial Archaeology class. Even if you are midly interested in ceramics, this beautifully illustrated book is an easy read, and very informative."
1,Beware!,"I bought this book looking for a nice, unabridged version of Bram Stoker's hard-to-find novel. It is definitely NOT what I expected. From what I can tell, Medium Rare Books (the ""publisher"") downloaded the text from Gutenberg (or some other copyright-free site), and merely transferred that directly to print. There are no proper paragraph breaks, no editing to speak of, lots of wasted space--the ""chapter headings"" take up an otherwise blank page all to themselves.Do not buy this book!"
4,overall good.,the case is overall good. it's padded quite nicely but the front pocket is a bit small [i can't fit my charger in it.]
4,Great price for what you get!,"This is a great product, by a great company, at a great price. I was able to install it myself without any problems. The only thing that I wish is that there was a way to listen to it over the internet to see how loud it is. For the price I paid, I was happy with the sound. I just wish it was a little louder."
5,A Touching Story,Trenton Kingsley is a haunted soul looking for the time that he can avenge things that were done to his family.Ariana is a naive but sweet girl who still believes in the good of people. She is also just what Trenton needs.Ariana's past is connected to Trenton's past in a way that she is about to find out in a shocking way. Trenton sees one of the ways to pay back her brother is to have the queen order Ariana to become his wife. She does marry Trenton and begins to tame the demons that haunt him. This story is about two people who are both strong and and protective. It is also about faith in love and in each other.This is classic Andrea Kane at her best. Don't miss this one.
3,Nicely writen,Nice use of another author to bring reality to the story.Theresa reminds me of someone l grow up with.
3,Traditional Romance,"The perfectly beautiful damsel, and who is perfectly humble, wins the heart of a the strong but cold, steely man. Love scenes in detail. Steamy. Predictable but held my interest."
4,Great for toddlers,This sweet board book has simple illustrations and wording to help a toddler understand a few of the basics of Passover. An adult won't learn much but it will familiarize your little guy and help him feel included in the holiday.
5,A Must Read for the Serious American History Buff,"I grew up in a military family, served 20 years in the USAF, and am a devoted reader of American History. This is an exceptional story of a unique piece of American culture, and should be required reading for high school American History studies. Kathy Mays Smith presents a compelling history of the men who were ""Roosevelt's Tree Army"" and helped our nation through the dark days of the depression. The book is well-written, well-documented, and filled with interesting photos and documents. A must read for the serious American History buff..."
5,A Library without this book is incomplete,"It is inconcievable to me that every library in every community and in every school does not have a copy of Gold Medal CCC Company 1538: A Documentary by Kathy Mays Smith. With the emphasis there is on history at this time, to not have this information available to everyone is nothing short of criminal. The youth do not have a clue what the CCC was and a good many adults are also lacking in information. We certainly hear how the depression affected many lives -- why don't we hear how the CCC helped so many lives?My personal belief is that the publisher should make a heavy push to acquaint libraries with the availability of this priceless book. Now!!"
1,F/A-18E Super Hornet Gold,"The only ""Gold"" in this sim is in the title. I had to look at the CD twice to make certain I hadn't loaded the first version in error. Shame on them for charging this much money for nothing more than a campaign upgrade, to an already poor sim. I do not recommend this sim to anyone. Save your money."
5,Big and does a good job,It is a big drying cloth that really does a great job soaking up water. Much better than the AmorAll 'rag' I bought at a B&M; store. That piece of junk started unraveling the first time I washed it. The Cobra cloth still looks brand new after being washed 3 or 4 times.Well worth the money for the quality.Darin
4,I like it But....,"I have an X5 and it's pretty big size vehicle and I like this product. Having said that, I had to wring it several times to use on the whole car. It does a good job but people/manufacturer should ""control"" their over-advertising by telling people there is no need to wring, one towel dries up everything etc. It's a very good product but it doesn't shoot webs or fly like a magic carpet."
5,Awesome product..must have,"I must honestly say this product is very absorbent better thank anything I ever tried I would definitely recommend this item,,,I am a critic but this guzzler works you won't regret and the custome service is on point...I must say they take there product and services into consideration ...and what customers think of them...kudos"
5,Great for singers,"If you are training to be a classical singer, this dictionary will become your best friend!Totally recommended!"
3,2 Reviews in 1,"The book itself appears to be well laid out. The pronunciation aids were the deciding factor for us as several of the other German-English dictionaries did not include them. So for the book itself we would rate it as a 5 star.Lowering our overall score was that we purchased a used book that was described as ""used - very good"". Well, the book is definitely usable but I would hardly describe it as ""very good"". The cover is quite tattered and the pages are showing their age with numerous bends, folds and the like. If I were picking the term for this book I would have chosen poor to good at best. I can only imagine what a copy that Amazon terms ""poor"" looks like."
2,Had so much potential,"and I liked where the author was going, but agree with so many people here that the language and thoughts were just too modern for the period in which the book was set. One major annoyance for me was that he couldn't speak to her without saying her name.....Caroline, Caroline, Caroline....alright, already, we know her name! And, I absolutely hate it when an author tells you that something happens rather than letting us read it as it occurs."
2,expected too much,"AFTER READING THE REVIEWS OF OTHER READERS I EXPECTED THIS BOOK TO HAVE AN INTERESTING STORY LINE AND IN DEPTH CHARACTERS. TO MY DISMAY THE CHARACTERS CAROLINE AND BRENT WERE UNREALISTIC AND RATHER BORING. I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE THAT CAROLINE COULD DIAGNOSE THE DAUGHTER ROSALYN AS BEING DEAF AFTER ONE BRIEF ENCOUNTER. I FELT VERY LITTLE CHEMISTRY EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO LEAD CHARACTERS AND FOUND MYSELF SKIMMING THROUGH THE PAGES TWO THIRDS INTO THE BOOK. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FRENCH SPY/ASSASAIN SEEMED VERY MUCH CONTRIVED, AND DID VERY LITTLE TO IMPROVE THE STORY. I DOUBT THAT I WILL READ ANY FUTURE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR."
5,Wonderful debut book!,"This is a wonderfully written, emotionally satisfying book with characters I cared a lot about.Caroline Grayson wants tbreed flowers, unfortunately, in 1800s England women are not taken seriously as scholars and Caroline's efforts to attend university seem thwarted.Just when she has made up her mind to leave everything behind and go to school (under a name that won't reveal she is a woman) her father determines she is to marry. Her first meeting with the Earl of Weymerth is not a promising one, but after the wedding, Caroline begins to discover just what a wonderful person her husband, Brent, really is.She must still decide whether to give up her dream or to leave Brent, whom she has fallen in love with, not to mention little Rosalyn whom she loves as well. Brent's past as a spy also poses problems.I absolutely loved this book. Caroline and Brent are wonderful lead characters and I hope you'll give them a try."
1,KNOCK OFF,110% NOT genuine abercrombie and fitch hoodie from the typos on the tag to the overly large and awkward fit. Certainly nowhere near the quality exhibited by real abercrombie. Do not purchase.
3,Comfortable but runs large.,"I can't suggest buying a 1/2 size smaller, but note, I've never had a 9 this large before."
4,Sized quite large,"I purchased these so I could have a cute, trendy looking flat shoe to wear this fall. All in all these are very comfortable shoes but be sure you order a size smaller than you normally wear. I vary between a 7 - 7 1/2 so I ordered a 7 because I read that they run large and it is still a 1/2 - full size too big."
5,Excellent and full of good information,"As always, Murach has provided a real working programmers text. This is a combination of the older volumes 1 and 2 with lots of new stuff thrown in. Beware - this is a full instructional text. It goes into depth on just about everything you would really want to know. I use it when I have questions as well as an instructional text for my junior staff programmers. The examples are also plentiful and well presented. Now that I do engagements on the road, I ship this text everywhere I go - wouldnt be without it as I still refer just to be sure I got it right."
2,Disappointed,"I was a foreign exchange student in Paraguay, and before I left I bought this dictionary. I had hoped to study Guaraní from it, but eventually gave up after finding many words that were not accurately translated. Alternate spellings are rarely listed, which makes finding words difficult in a language like Guaraní that is more oral than written, with lots of regional variations. The small number of words and lack of compound words (which is basically all words that you'd encounter) made this dictionary basically useless to me. It may just be outdated, but overall, I would not recommend it. Better to buy a good English-Spanish dictionary before you go, then the little blue Ñe'ryru Guaraní-Español dictionary that nearly every student in Paraguay seems to own. It's fairly cheap, and if you need a real Guaraní dictionary, is definitely worth the few dollars."
3,"Decent video, but some music is very bad","The over all video was not too bad. However, some of the music was so severely depressing that I had to hit the MUTE button on my TV remote in order to keep it from messing me up mentally (aggravating depression). I'm talking about music that resembles acid rock (EXTREMELY depressing and MUCH worse than typical ""rock"" music). Barring this glaring problem, the rest of it is quite good."
5,beautiful voice,"This album transports you to a world of purfumed winds, exotic sands, and other such delights. The french lyrics are beautifully poetic, and the melodies are nostalgic and dreamy.The instrumentation combines traditional sounds with more organic sound effects such as in ""la neige au sahara"" and fuse them seamlessly with western instrumentation. Anggun's voice is deep, rich and melodic.I really enjoy putting this CD in my stereo and turning it up loud, on surround-sound, to get the full effect of the lush instrumentation.I would recommend this CD to all music lovers. Anggun manages to create a unique and multicultural album with catchy melodies and introspective lyrics."
4,Feast For A Fan,"The NOTLD 25th Anniversary documentary was a great pleasure to watch. The sound studio scene with Karl Hardman & Marilyn Eastman was fascinatingly revealing, as were the photographs of the made-up zombies. The meeting between Hardman, Romero, Russo and Streiner could have been a little more sharp, though, as it is now a mere friendly chat between old pals. I also missed people like Judith O'Dea, the late Duane Jones and Kyra Schon (of whom I noticed her own website!) Altogether big fun for a horror classic fan."
1,Horrible,"This was a gift from a well-meaning relative.The audio is unintelligible.The menus are difficult.A $20 toy, not a $200 tool."
2,pay more get somethig better,This is a nice looking racquet but performs below par. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for decent racquets go with the Joola brand of racquets they are far superior.
4,Cowboy Gear,The book has a brief introduction into cowboy action shooting and is about 3/4 on gun values. It would probably be better to purchase Fladerman's gun values if that is what you need.
2,Poor,"Taffin's name brings credibility, but I found this tome dated and severely lacking.A shame because they could have tripled the size of this book easily and discarded the quickly outdated and irrelevant gun catalog section.Avoid!"
1,Found mine! Author needs to update!,I had this little gem of a book tucked away and found it while cleaning. It helped me when I was a Bride 25 years ago. The author should update it; I found the information very convenient and helpful!
4,The Count at his best !,This is an excellent Swing CD of classic Basie with tunes from the 50's and 60's. An awesome CD for those just starting to listen to swing. It is very easy to listen to and gets you jumpin'. It is truely the Count at his best.
4,African Children's Choir is Awesome!,"The African Children's Choir recently performed at my church, and I was so impressed that I felt compelled to take them home with me (so to speak). I went to Amazon.com and found this DVD ""Teach me to Dance"". This video is absolutely marvelous. In fact, I haven't had possession of the DVD pretty much since I received it, because friends and co-workers keep wanting to take it home and watch it themselves. It is wonderful!"
3,So.. So...,I don't know.. after watching the Libera dvd.. it is a big let down when i watch this dvd..The audio recording is not that good.. the quality of the dvd visual is somehow not that clear.. pixelated..
1,"tasteless, and too spicy",i ordered them and opened 1 and tried to eat itbut found it to be really tasteless and way too spicy.my husband almost threw up and said throw the rest in the garbage.next time i will buy solo and try it before ordering quantity.
5,macc rules .,"The daftest band in the world bar none,If singing about flatulent Germans,Hairy French,girls or beer.Every song a laugh till it hurts.Might be hard for non brits,to understand what they are singing[they do provide lyrics on there web page]but when you do fathom it out you will die laughing.A wonderfully silly band."
2,2-Hit Cyborg Combo!!,"(I meant 4 stars, not 2. Oops) If you grew up in the 1980's like me, than this particular Double Feature Editon should seem very savory. Although 2 very different films thematically, both Terminator and Robocop deal with very cool cyborg stories. I remember loving both these films as a kid and the concept of having both these films on one package is a no brainer, especially if you don't have these in your DVD library already. Bottom line, you won't get more wall-to-wall cyborg action in one package than this beauty!"
4,Lifelike Quality Toy,These horses are detailed and durable. My daughter loved them and I have kept them for other young children that come over. We even found one that looks like my daughter's pony.
2,Nothing special,"This books is a collection of the author's ideas about drawing. It's subtitled ""a revolutionary right-brain approach to figure drawing"". I understand that some people really liked the book, but it was only very few parts of it that I found useful, and none of it revolutionary. I'm not saying that this book contains nothing useful. I'm sure that if one studies it carefully, one will learn a few things. But it's nothing special and I really don't understand what the rave reviews are about."
3,You love it or you hate it,This is one of those books that will totally blow you away or make you wish that you had not wasted your energy on. After reading the reveiws I found it easy to relate to the ones that praised the book and the ones that demolished it. There are some chapters that I found amazing and others that I could not finish do to boredom. It is similar to his first book but it does share some new insights that can benefit almost any relationship.When reading this book one must remember that it was not written to just fit there needs it is written to a broad audience.
1,after the horse is out of the barn ...Mr. Gray?,"I read this book and my emmediate thought was ""damage controll"" ,a book to clean up the mess pop-culture and John Gray are already responsible for.The book is just another addition to the ongoing parade of Gray books which lack any new case to present,it reads like the scrambled and re-edited words of all his other books.Making a long story short - John Gray is doing nothing more than selling the same plot under different titles."
2,Don't Bother,I read the great reviews for this book and couldn't wait to look at all the pictures. But the bouquets are not very pretty and there aren't many different styles to choose from. I recommend The Knot's book on flowers instead.
2,Not worth the money,"Although I absolutely love the bouquet shown on the cover, I would have to say that the rest of the bouquets pictured are not worth the investment in the book. It seemed that most were outdated or simply lacked creativity. I was searching for contemporary or even classic looking designs and this was not the book for me. Sunflowers or wildflowers were shown quite often, so if you are searching for a book that hightlights these types of flowers, you might consider it. Skip it if you are looking for new ideas, red or deep colored flowers, or anything related to other wedding flower pieces (no arrangements, few corsages, limited bridesmaid flowers)."
2,Poor content. Not for flowershop owners,If you are a flowershop owner and searching for a variety of fresh ideas for your clients this is not the appropiate book. It has a few nice photos but they are scarce. Definitely not worth it.
3,Nice pictures for your coffee table,"This book was not as good as I expected. Some of the bouquets were creative, but worth the price of the book. I got more out of Better Home and Garden's Creative Collection ""Simply Creative Wedding Flowers"". This magazine was a thousand times better than this book in terms of getting creative and unique ideas for wedding flowers."
4,Great Book,This book gives you some great ideas on the kinds of flowers you may choose and gives you a good idea of how to put them together if you choose.
4,"Comfortable, Functional, Inexpensive Shorts","These shorts feel like a cotton blend, so are slightly heavier than a full synthetic fabric. The benefit is that they are also more durable, and they are still quite comfortable for bicycle commuting in hot weather. I usually wear them over a pair of bicycle shorts for my 8 - 10 mile ride to work. They come with a sewn-in mesh lining; I followed the advice of several other reviewers and cut out the lining immediately upon receiving them. My only cavil is that the pockets are not very deep, and they have only one back pocket - so if you're used to carrying a lot of stuff on you, you'll either need a bag or a different pair of shorts. Apart from that minor issue, though, they're great and you can't beat the price."
4,Better than Country Boy Records,"Man , this Raiheim CD , is way better than anything Thugged Out's ever came out with (plus better than Contry Boy, although he disses them throughout the CD), especially now that they are nation wide with their new Distribution deal w/ Orchard. I havent bought it yet but I listened to it , and if you havent you need to."
3,"Blooody campaign, bloody Haig","Quite a good expose of the limitations of Haig as a general, insensitive, uncaring, obstinate and incompetent, a farce of a man if not for the tragedy of tens of thousands lives wasted by his idiotic tactics."
2,It is okay,"It was not as I expected. It is okay, dont' think I would of bought it had I known what it was really like, but it is okay."
1,WHO TAUGHT THIS DUMB ASS HOW TO TYPE!!!!!!,"The author of this book Michael Lane must have been taught how to spell by his son. this stupid son of a bitch mispelled every word in the book. I can understand why he is so dumb mostly because he is crippled, but the fact the books sounds like it was made by the power rangers makes me think this guy is the next michael jackson. in all if you buy this book you are aiding terrorism, and if you read it you are just making yourself that much dumber. SO PLEASE DON'T BUY AND READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This BOOK SUCKS,"This book sucks balls, it deals with homosexual and really gay text. The way the author refers to the son in the story makes me feel that he himself hates his son. the fact the writer is crippled makes the story really gay.Find something better to do michael lane like ug your son."
1,get something else,this was a not a good book they was alot of stupid things in this book they were trying to tell about plants to eat and not to eat and they had very poor black and white pictures of the plants most of the book is made up of unwanted infromation
5,this book was awsome,the illustrations and the info in the book is very accurate i love to be outdoors and i have spent about 10-20 nights a month in the outdoors and often i do that with minimal gear and not much for the fancy items this book is going to be in my pack from now on and it will be a valued itemthe book was great thankschad
4,OUTDOOR SURVIVAL HANDBOOK,"THIS BOOK IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHILE IT STILL GIVES YOU A LOT OF INFORMATION.I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK TO MY FRIENDS.THNX,BILL CUNNINGHAM"
2,The Outdoor Survival Handbook by Raymod Mears,Alot of the same info.Which has already been written before in previous American books.
4,good book,"I think Konstantinos is honest about his dark interests and is not over the top about being a 'goth' unlike John J. Coughlin who seems to focus on that way too much. I have read all the Konstantinos books but particularly like this one as it goes beyond spells and rituals and starts to explore psychic potential and the power of the mind. It is strange how John J.Coughlin and Konstantinos are both from the New York area, both goths and are writing on the same topic of dark paganism - I do wonder if they are rivals or friends!The only thing I did not like about this book is the title as it is a bit tacky and might give people the wrong idea about the book.Anyway this book is a good read!"
5,finding the current,"This book is by far one that will be by myside. It helps understanding the commune with the dark gods and goddesses of the night, making sence of the nocturnal sabbats. The understanding without making you fustrated and confussed.If you have read Nocturnal Witchcraft then this book is for you."
2,whom do i see about getting the 3 hours of my llife back?,"this is a great book...if you 15 and you've finaly run out of ravenwolf books to read ...otherwise...save your money. While some of his visualization excersises are interesting, its pretty obvious, even before you read the rest of his books, that he's building up to admiting he's not a wiccan or even pagan, he's heading for satanist...or a drug treatment center, whichever comes first. And I have no problem with that, but lets call this what it is...pandering to disafected teenagers, angsty 20 somethings and bitter 30's. If you need something to put on your coffee table to annoy visiting Jehovah's witneses or to scare your parents...this is the author and these are the books, but if your looking for useful information.. its not in here."
1,Not for me,"I really did not care for the works of this author. It just seems, well, off somehow in relation to my understanding of things."
1,"mia malakia re malaka , men je thkievaseis to","akou na dis olan, itan mian imeran pou ekatsa na to thkievaso, eteliosa pou lalis to thkievasma tountou a3iothavmastou book napoumen tzie, etsi egira piso, tzie lalo ma eshi etsi mana plasmata pou grafoun tzie vivlia tzie xorigountous tzie eteries themas, e oi"
3,Meh.,"I got this book in the Nocturnal Witch Collection and read it after having read Nocturnal Witchcraft which imo is the better of the two. This book states that its more advanced , but in the sense that its more advanced than its predescessor Nocturnal Witchcraft. However, this book doesn't bring much new to the table. Many of the exercises in this book would be thought off by anyone who is creative just by reading the previous book. Thats true for me at least. I say get this book if your not very creative or want the ""complete"" set."
5,Ant Bully of Colorado,"This game rocks. It's fun to spend hours in front of the 80"" DLP HD television playing this game. I don't want to go outside or ride on my bike. WOW! Imagine all of the fun I'm having playing this AWESOME GAME. It's so cool. Thank you for having this game for me to purchase. Fast shipping. Packed well."
2,Ant Bully-I thought this would be a cool game for my 5yr old???,This video was very dark on the tv screen. I think my 5 yrs old was bored with it. I wouldn't reccomend buying this game for entertainment.
5,Excellent jazz recording,I had the opportunity to see Irakere live a few weeks ago and immediately came to Amazon.com to find a CD. I chose this one and I'm glad I did. Even though some of the personnel are different this recording is still as wonderful as they were live. Their Latin Jazz groove is an outstanding blend of many influences.
5,awesome chain!!,"This is one awesome chain. cuts wood like butter....prefers hardwood, but cuts softwood good too. stays sharp for a long time and I haven't experienced any significant kickback. It's the chain I will be getting from now on."
3,"Some old concepts, but plenty of applicable strategies that work","I liked the book, but I confess: I still check my e-mail in the morning. And then again later in the morning... and in the afternoon. So I'm not ""cured."" But I don't deal with hundreds of time-consuming e-mails, so I think the point is not as valid for me.3/5 because some of the points were obvious and redundant (do the important work first, delegate what you can, don't be a perfectionist) but some of the others were helpful and all are applicable to work-life in some degree. The book is written for the executives, managers, and busy full-time professionals; so some of her recommendations are less helpful for the freelancer, work-from-home professional. But the concepts are good, especially the ""dance close to the revenue line"" and the ""quiet hour"" ideas. Worth reading if you want to be more productive and could use some help getting organized.-[...]"
2,Disappointed. No useful advice.,"I bought this book for myself, expecting to find some useful advice to help me organize my day a little better and to stay focused on priorities. I have been in management for 12 years and I expected this book to offer some new insights into time management and other daily challenges. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and struggled to find some useful advice within the first half and have since put it down.The book seems to target a junior audience with a certain type of personality that is more focused on fitting in and accommodating others, rather than those focused on leadership and results.The book itself feels really cheap. I is printed on that cheap news-print paper like those crossword puzzle books."
3,"boring, some tips","I found this book too boring to read. The subject matter interested me, but the presentation is not well done. I liked reading about the stories but most of the material was repeated too much."
2,Scrapple at Best,"This book gushes of leftovers. It is a very wordy read and doesn't get to any practical sort of information until the latter half, most of which is not only a repeat of earlier books, but also common sense stuff (this coming from someone who doesn't instinct-wise have a firm grasp on time management) that i have gleaned from many other sources, and in a more concise format. although her other books are great, i don't recommend this one."
2,Gave it away the next day,"This book begins with a questionaire to rate your level of organization at work. I filled it out, scored it, and promptly donated it to my library. I am obviously more organized within my work environment than at home. Only buy this book if you are a mess at work and unable to complete projects on time."
5,Excellent,"I've owned this device for two weeks now. The USB 2.0 transfer speed is nothing compared to SATA or SATA II, but to pay a bill for 200GB of storage (which is equal to approximately 190GB if you're computer savvy) and have a small enclosure is great.So far, I haven't experienced any problems with the drive being recognized on Windows XP Pro SP2 or Windows Media Center Edition. On Server 2003, it loaded but I had to add it as a drive manually using the disk manager utility. Works great if you need a backup drive and plan on doing when not in peak useage.The drive is very quiet and I haven't experienced any reliability problems to this point. I would have rather had an external SATA drive, but for the price I paid and what it gives I truly don't believe you can beat this deal.Highly recommended."
1,Maxtor 500 GB USB 2.0,"BUY THIS HARD DRIVE, if you want to waste $100. I bought a 500 GB hard drive from Maxtor 1 year ago for about $100 that looked exactly like this one. It stopped working after 7 or 8 months. I lost 484 GB of pictures, games, movies, books, and documentary videos (my 400 GB BBC and Discovery video collection!). My friend also bought the exact 500 GB hard drive to store his Japanese animations, and it also stopped working under a year. If you want to lose a $100, BUY THIS HARD DRIVE."
2,A disappointing read,The characters were likeable and the basic story a good idea. Way too predicable- what I read in the first 50 pages- the remaining 300 did nothing to surprise me. Too many descriptions of street scenes and internal dialogue slowed the pace down to a crawl. I tend to read romances in 2-3 afternoons. This took almost 3 weeks.
4,Wonderful historical detail,"I zoomed through the first half of this book thanks to the great historical detail. I really felt that ""you are there"" feeling thanks to Ms. Birmingham's great powers of description. But then it took me forever to finish the 2nd half due to, as the first reviewer said...Nothing happened. I realized all that had happened really was the hero & heroine got closer, but there were no external events, and way too many descriptions of her outfits, and what they ate for dinner.I also appreciate the fact she didn't depict them bickering over Nothing, as so many romance couples seem to do. The H&H; were both likable."
4,Szell in Italy,"This budget-line title from the Aura label features one of my favorite conductors, George Szell, leading the Cleveland Orchestra in live recordings made for Radiotelevisione della Svizzera Italiana. The performances are of Schumann's 2nd Symphony and Berlioz's ""Marche hongroise"" from ""La Damnation de Faust,"" both recorded in 1957, and Debussy's ""La Mer"" which was recorded in 1968. Surprisingly, the great Friedrich Gulda even joins on piano for ""La Mer."" The sound is very good, but doesn't come close to matching the same quality as Szell's first-rate studio accounts currently available on Sony. It is a fun disc for sure, but by no means definitive."
4,adequate basic kit,"functional standard set of components suitable for light home use, plastic parts may fatigue if used in a more demanding situation"
3,New Contemporary More Fun with Dick and Jane,The cover was torn on the book when I received it. The book was what I expected-somewhat up to date Dick and Jane book. Rather funny too!
1,pukey,"My 8 year daughter and I read this book tonight, and both thought it was bad. My other daughter (5) had learned to read with the original books (as had myself), and thought this would be the same type of book. I was very disappointed in this book, and would never recommend it. The part with the boys playing with guns and shooting each other (as Mr. T) was pathetic. I'm sorry I don't agree with the other reviews - but, I thought as a book to teach young ones to read, it was not suitable."
1,this animated series has been rated CRAP,"As an HUGE fan of the series, I have to warn you that this is nothing more than a cheap attempt to make a quick buck on a popular series. Its apparent from the very begining that the producers & writers for this cartoon series have NEVER seen a single episode of Stargate SG1. They DONT stick to the story line, the team looks like they escaped from the Galaxy High cartoon series from the mid 80s. The intro theme song could be used to torture prisoners & small animals. MGM should be ashamed of itself for allowing this series to be made. & heres a final fact about this series: the ONLY things it has in common with the Sci-Fi channel series, is A: the name Stargate, & B: the Stargate itself. & on a final note. for those of you who said this cartoon series features great animation, characters & stories, your either A: Employees of MGM, or B: Dont know what good animation is.Final Verdict:SG-1 Fans should AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"
4,stargate infinity,Its just a show for a kid. Its not an art form. If mom and dad are watching Stargate a child could watch this animated spin off. This is something a seven year old can watch. Its no better or worse vs Buzz Lightyear tv series. The Buzz movies are much better. Better animated shows are out there but for $10.00 for 5 episodes its worth it. Its just a cartoon spin off for gradeschool kids. If your over that age watch the series. Its not much better or worse than the japanese tv cartoons. Thats all.
5,Eye candy,"This book is just gorgeous to look at. The artwork is wonderful. I really enjoy cultural books like this.What child wouldn't want to learn how to count such exotic creatures as leopards, lions, ostriches, giraffes, hippos, wildebeests, zebras, warthogs, monkeys, and elephants. It is an extra treat that the swahili names are added too.This is so much better than an ordinary counting book with it's interesting creatures and cultural introduction to Tanzania. A great way to encourage kids to learn about far away places.We combined this book with Mama Panya's Pancakes and had a wonderful time learning about Africa."
4,Just perfect,These bags were the perfect size and they were very easy to use - the treats came out perfect and we were able to seal them up.
2,UNDER STRESS ORDERED THESE THINKING THEY WERE WHITE PAPER BAGS.,"Under a time crunch preparing for a wedding candy/dessert buffet table, I was looking for this shape bag in paper. Who knows what time of the midnight hours that I ordered these, but thought they were looked like paper and they were cello. I wanted to stamp the bags with a couple specific logo and this just would not work with the cello bags. I hope that I can use them sometime in the future."
3,Good,"Good book, old, but good... I liked the plot, you start to feel sympathetic for Bella, poor old Bella. It keeps you wanting more"
2,Messy!,I didn't even use this product long enough to see if it even worked b/c the graphics on the bottle come off if you get even the smallest amount of oil on it and it gets all over EVERYTHING. Was not worth using again after all the mess.
5,Yey granddad!,"This book is a wonderful read. I learned a lot about his career. And it opened up a whole new life to me. For all 20 years of my life so far, I have seen Granddad as only a grandfather, but reading this showed me what his life was like before we grandkids came along. He has done so much more than I could ever have imagined before.Its an inspirational book from start to finish."
5,Great Deal,This is a wonderful book written by an equally wonderful man. I was so happy to find this on Amazon at such a reasonable price.
5,Wonderful!,"I bought some marble wine chillers for Christmas gifts, and I popped these stoppers inside them, as an extra surprise!So cute!"
4,Very good,"Very good photos and Many new roses,some ítems where in the lástima boom,but I liked it very much ANAd it is useful"
4,lOADED with information,I am just beginning to grow roses and have read many books. This has it all and I like the format.
4,A short parallelist viewpoint,"This book is an overview of the book of Revelation from the parallelist viewpoint (other viewpoints, each briefly described early in the book, are preterist, historicist, futurist, and idealist). In the parallelist viewpoint, each section in the book of Revelation runs parallel, at the same time, but looked at from different angles. Perhaps it is because the book is only an overview and only about 150 pages, but I don't think Bewes provided sufficient basis to make his case for his viewpoint. The book makes some good points and is worth reading, but I would recommend also reading commentaries by other authors on Revelation that are more substantial and that are based on other viewpoints. And if only one commentary on Revelation is to be read, it perhaps should not be this one."
2,Okay.......,"I really like Aly and AJ, but I wasn't too impressed when I saw this movie. It definitely wasn't the worst thing I've ever watched, but it's not worth buying or even watching twice..."
1,Not a good Disney movie,"I usually like Disney movies. They are simple, colorful, delivers a good message and it is mindless TV for about an hour and a half. When I started watching Cow Girls, this is what I was expecting. The movie is about two girls who have to work at their father's dairy company and must soon save the company when things start to go wrong. The movie was awful; it had bad acting, bad, super super bad dialogue, cliché scenes (but to the extreme) and it was just bad in general. Did anyone bother to call the police when the guy stole the money?!My major issue with the movie is the dialogue, it was pathetic. Alyson and Amanda Michalka are not amazing actresses, but they are not that horrible. But, the script in this movie makes their acting horrible. I'd rather watchZenon: Girl of 21st Century,Cadet KellyorHigh School Musical (Two-Disc Remix Edition). This movie was really bad and I was appalled that it made it to the TV screen."
5,"""Lifes Amazing When you're on the ride""",I Love this movie staring Amanda & Alyson Michlkait was their first movie together!SO COOL
3,Light Frothy Disney Stuff,"Anyone expecting a hard hitting look at the realities of life from a Disney Channel Movie is barking up the wrong tree. Yeah the plot and believable dialogue are lacking from Cowbelles, but there's nothing fundamentally offensive about this film. Aly and AJ Michaulka star as pampered sisters forced to work at their father's dairy to learn the value of a dollar. While he's out of town, Bob Fenwick the Dairy's accountant runs off to the Bahamas or something leaving the girls to salvage the family business. Of course everything ends happily with the girls having learned that there's more to life than money and appearances...yay! The film suffers from a bad script...there were no real surprises and the dialogue was really average at best...even the best actor would've been hamstrung in this movie. Of course, if you have a 9-19 year old girl whose a huge fan of Aly and AJ, they probably won't notice the mediocrities."
4,Great Book Must Read,I love this book. Even though I'm just 15. I thought is had an amazing plot and a wonderful ending. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the beginning. It was incredibly slow and boring. But I'm so glad I decided to keep reading!
4,Great home workout!,This a good alternative for going to the gym. I have not done yoga regularly for the past 5 years and found this to be a great re-introduction. It is challenging enough for someone who exercises 3-4xwk and needs to balance cardio/strength training.
5,A really great comprehensive Ravi and Ana DVD!!,"This is an excellent all around yoga DVD. In comparison to other ravi/ana DVD's I would say this one is moderate level, but can be adapted to beginner--it is challenging in a nice way. This particular workout is very well put together, is well balanced, and has plenty of options for the matrix to choose from. Although there is some minor glitch with the matrix option at times when it doesn't always work--but I think that may be DVD player compatibility issue. Overall, I would say that out of other 7 ravi and ana DVD's that I have, this one is at the top. Love it!"
4,Good for Beginners!,I am a Yoga novice so i thought this is perfect for people who are just starting out with Yoga! Highly Recommended!
5,enjoyable,"I really enjoy all of their programs & found this to be fun as well. I am 66 & have been doing Yoga for 20 plus years. I have many of Ana's DVD's & try to do one each day.I have many other exercise programs as well but I always come back to yoga because it can be can be practiced anywhere at anytime.I love Kundalini Yoga,this DVD is a great way to start if you are new to yoga,instructions are very clear."
2,Not one of their best DVDs,"I was a bit disappointed with this new release. The beach background and the music were distracting and the exercises were not as well designed as in their other DVDs. I am a fan of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh. A month after I started the Fat Free Yoga DVD, I withdrew my gym membership and did yoga only. I own several of their DVDs and I rotate them in the course of a week. Overall, I feel healthier, happier, sleep better, and I even like myself better. My favorite DVDs are Lose Weight & Feel Great, Yoga Beauty Body, and Yoga Cleanse."
1,10 pills???,"No matter what any Hoodia products have labled as far as dosage, you must have 1500mg of pure Hoodia in your system for it to work. This particular product contains just 150mg per pill, which means you have to take 10 pills at once! Also, keep in mind, there are only 60 pills per bottle, so 1 bottle =6 doses or 2 days. Save your money and find something stronger."
4,Great Basic Guide for Hikes,"This book is a well written guide to hikes, not hiking in general. It's pages are filled with short explanations of different hikes in New England. Each chapter has maps and directions on how to get to each hike. It also offers information as to how accessable the hikes are to hikers, the handicapped, or horseback riders.The author rates each hike on difficulty and beauty. The range of difficulty goes from A Stroll to A Real Butt Kicker. This was a great book. All in all I found this a very easy to understand practical guide to hiking locations. It even tells which hikes your dog can go on with you."
1,slow and poor quality,"Only one good track (long black veil), otherwise poor production (acoustics bad) and overall is slow and not heart felt."
2,Not the best choice for a two year old,"I thought this would be great for my two year old daughter to have when her baby brother came home from the hospital, but once the novelty of a giggling, moving doll wore off (in a few days) she much preferred her simple baby dolls. This doll is not cuddly and is very hard to hug and drag around the house the way my daughter likes to do. There are too many little accessories and it's just too complicated for a two year old - may be better for an older child."
5,MOTHER OF 2,"hI, COULD ANYONE TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO EXPENSIVE? I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER TO GIVE TO HER WHEN I HAD MY SON IN 2001. i SURELY DIDNT PAY $200.00 PLUS DOLLARS FOR HIM & I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS GOING FOR SO MUCH. THANKS YOU 2 ALL WHO RESPOND! :)"
5,Lovely,"This is one of the most beautiful, light and lingering scents I have ever worn. It has come to be my favorite. I bought it while in Hawaii and was relieved when I was looking for it again that it was still available."
5,The Fragrance of White Ginger,"I have a white ginger plant that blooms in late summer. The fragrance of the bloom is light and one of those scents that you want to inhale over and over and exhale with an aauugghh!!I searched out a white ginger cologne because I enjoy the scent of the bloom. This cologne mist smells strong when first applied, but dries to a light scent that you want to inhale over and over! I like the fragance base as it rubs in easily when applied to the wrist."
4,They look great!,"We love the look of these. We were going for a beachy theme for our nursery while looking to replace the drawer knobs on our baby changing table, and we stumbled across these. They are perfect. Our only problem was that the screws that came with them were too short so we had to go to Home Depot to purchase longer ones. They also cost more than I think they should, but maybe that is just my opinion."
5,GREAT TRAVEL GAME,"My 8 year old niece loved this game. We decided it would be a great game for travel to Grandmas or on a long car trip, or if a child is stuck in bed sick. There are no small pieces or directions to lose. Buzz & Flutter are fun to move around the board and it helps with counting, reading and following directions. If you have children at your house all the time or occasionally this is a must have in your closet!"
4,Haven't used much,"I got this book because it was sugested by one of my education teachers that I get a text for the content I'll be teaching to help writing practice lessons for her class. So i went to my old hs and asked what they used and the teacher seemed to love this book, i however have not spent much time with it and therefore cannot give a full evaluation. i can say, however, that the content is good and straight forward; there is no confusion or jumping around"
3,Denny,"The book is a very good book, but the owner made it out to be in much better condition that it was."
3,"very good, just fell short of great","aldo he is a very good guitar player he does not show the creativity or aventorous spirit a J. Satriani or Steve Vai show, very enjoyable record to hear once in a while. I enjoy his covers very much but after a just one run of the record I kind of get tired of the sound and need to jump to a different artist. Well woth the cost and should complement any electric guitar music fan collection."
5,Can you beleive how good this song is?,"This song is a brilliant one. I've only heard it on a bad quality MPEG clip that lasted about 20 seconds, and I'm still convinced that it's one of the best songs that Rage have ever done. Yeah, we all like a bit Limp Bizkit, and sometimes a bit of Korn (NOT RAMMSTEIN), but we all know that Rage are the best. I was having doubts about Rage after I had listened to Evil Empire about 500 times and the self-titled one about 3000 (no exaggeration) - because it does bore you slightly after that many hearings. But when I hear this new material, I know that they are back on the road. GO RAGE."
3,a simple cd,"I love RATM and I like their LPs better.This cd is alright,good for beginners.Guerrilla Radio is pretty good.Without a face is an awesome song about The White Wall.A fairly good cd"
4,It does work on 64-bit windows,"I was not sure whether to get this interface for my brand new Mares Puck computer, because previous reviewer stated it does not work on 64-bit Windows. I thought I would be able to figure it out, and it turned out to be pretty simple - when USB driver failed to install, I followed Windows 7 suggestion in ""Action Center"" and downloaded the driver it has recommended. To save you some time, here is the Silicon Lab driver required for DRAK software to work: (...). After that Drak worked fine and was able to download logbook from my Mares Puck without a problem. One star is taken off because it didn't work right out of the box."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"It works, but there are no instructions other than for how to set it up and hook it to the Nemo. There are features that allow you to modify tank values and other info, but they are disabled in the Nemo Wide. The Nemo Air and Puck can use these features, so why they're disabled for the Nemo Wide is puzzling, and annoying. It would be good to be able to input beginning and ending pressures and have it calculate your BVR, especially when the features are showing,but don't work.So far, As a Nemo Wide user, I'm not impressed"
4,Wrist Style Dive Computer Interface,"Hated it when I first got it. Software wasn't great and seemed to have trouble connecting but finally got all the soft-ware loaded, updated, computer restarted and then would load soft-ware first and wiat until it aksed for connection. Since then its run fine. Software is still alittle confusing but that's partly me trying to decide if I want it to store all my dives or just the most recent or have a different dive book for each trip I take. Its been very convenient to be able to fill in missing items from my dives that I didn't write down. Does what it claims so my only complaint is the price. Its USB cable on one end with a couple connectors on the other. Why these things aren't less than $10 boggles the mind."
3,Disappointing Conclusion,"I was very much looking forward to Leroy and Stitch, but came away quite disappointed. This feature length conclusion to the tv series of Lilo and Stitch, focuses on what would happen when it came time for Lilo and Stitch to say goodbye. That in itself can open up so many possibilities, but unfortunately they were not made the most of here. Granted the film gets off to a great start and some of the action is edge of your seat stuff towards the end, but the love between Lilo and Stitch that we've come to know and love, is simply rushed by here.This film will be acceptable for most kids I think, but as a big conclusion to a much loved series it is a little disappointing. Still, at least it's not a disaster.If this is the best that we have as a Lilo and Stitch conclusion, then I'd like another Lilo and Stitch feature please Disney."
1,Not even worth one star.,"I just rented this.I was hoping this would be better than the lackluster 2nd Lilo & Stitch, but I was wrong. This was SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD! As a matter of fact, I think this is even as bad as the 2nd one.Here we go with the plot...Lilo, Stitch, and Jumba catch the experiments and find their homes. Gantu has left earth and frees Dr. Hamsterviel out of jail, and together they create Leoroy, who will dominate the earth.I really hated this film. If the 2nd one sucked, why see this?AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
2,Poor quality,There were marks all over the test book and I can't use it without having to erase them one by one.
4,Better than most,This phone works better than most cordless phone I've had and the battery life is super. Range is very good. Gripes: no ringer hi-lo-off switch and I cant talk and use the microwave oven at the same time.
4,A First CD That Shows A Lot Of Heart,"Honor Finnegan is off to a good start with her first CD, ""Human Heart."" Her years of singing with jazz bands, blues bands, big bands and traditional Irish bands (including DaDannan) are integrated to provide an eclectic folk-pop sound with heart - soulful vocals and spiritually-oriented lyrics.Honor has a beautiful voice that raises hearts and stirs something within. She etches a joy and liveliness in each song with her rhythm and tonality. This is earthy and enjoyable music that rocks.Greg Anderson co-produced, co-arranged, and played on ""Human Heart."" Steve Holley (drums), Ivan Goff (pipes and whistles), Lisa Gutkin (violin), and Rufus Cappadocia (cello) are also featured on ""Human Heart."""
3,Good Movie,"this kind of movie were found more entertaining than any Hollywood movie. i was one of those who under estimate the bollywood movie until one day i decide to buy a video betamax(trend at the time)of bollywood movie titled pati patni aur tawaif.and i realize that bollywood movie can be so entertaining. the song,the story, even the dance.were hilariously entertaining.since than i like to watch it sometime. the movie pati patni aur tawaif itself is an average India movie at the time.but the history of how i like India movie because of this film,make me take this as an unforgettable classic"
2,A little disappointing,"I bought this paperweight for a friend who collects them. It is pretty by not very impressive, it is small a rather plain. I guess I should have expected it given the low price. It did arrive promptly and was nicely boxed."
4,I love my first guitar,"No disappointments so far. Very playable. I'm 31 and new to guitars and don't have much to compare this to. That said, the guitar is in good condition, and the DVD that comes with it taught me a lot. The amp is plenty powerful for rockin the basement. It has a distortion switch that will instantly transform the sound to a powerful rock guitar. When combined with the pickup switch on the guitar, you get a good range of sounds. From a clean jazz guitar to a crunchy distorted rock sound.The DVD and Tuner that are included with this package are great extras for the first time player.My package was missing a few items when it arrived (picks, xtra strings, tuner, strap), but I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor, and they got the parts shipped to me no problem."
2,Boring,"I remember playing rampage on the nes with my brother 15 years ago. Several versions have come out since then and NOTHING HAS CHANGED.The controls are as impricise as it was on the NES. The larger selection of characters are just filler, since they all have the same powers. Oh yeah and ""3D neighborhoods?"" No that is total BS. You can move left or right, not in or out. How is that 3D? Oh that's right - 3D characters, 3D buildings in a 2D world. In my book being able to move left and right means that this game is 2D.If you loved the original (it is included), or the 64 version (also included) this may have some value. If you wanted to check up on a familiar franchise to see how they have changed, move on."
4,Fish Napkin Holder Review,"Cute item, but I wish it could have been a little bigger/taller, so that the napkins would hold better."
3,Cute but have seen better participatory books,"Though this is a cute book, it didn't capture my kids' attention as much as others. The drawings were not colorful or interesting and illustrations of just two bears. The activities are pretty fun, except for 10, which is ""start again."" Kind of anticlimactic. My 9-month-old likes it somewhat but my two-year-old was quickly bored by it. We have much preferred Count by Denise Fleming for 0-1 1/2 years old; we made up movement to go with each page. We've really enjoyed getting up and moving with Toddlerobics by Zita Newcome for 1 1/2 and 2 years old. It's really colorful and has many more movements to do. I think my kids will continue to enjoy Toddlerobics for a couple of more years."
5,Really Cool,"Yay! A canadian who is not anything like Shania or Avril or whatever. Personally, can't stand 'em. This guy rocks! You have to love his style, just go with the flow. Punkish/rockish and in between, this can really appeal to almost anyone."
1,terrycloth insoles,I wasted my money buying these. I wear a size 71/2 to 8. they are to small for my shoes. I've only worn them once and i can see that they are coming apart.
3,Not impressed,"First off, it didn't stick well so it didn't stay in place. Because it didn't stay in place it was uncomfortable to keep in my shoe. I wear heels and having so much padding at my heel made me step out of my shoe. I'm tossing these puppies."
5,Life Saver inserts,I had one pair which I have only recently used because I have neuroma pain and general pain in the ball of my foot. I have tried everything for relief and these pads with gel cushions on my toes work the best in combination with anti-inflamatory cream. That is why I am ordering 5 pair.
1,think twice you buy this,"Even, this product was rated as compatible to Mac, it does not work with certain Macs, G3 PowerBook (Pismo) is one. Tech support does not understand why."
2,"Bad Grammar, Bad info, Bad book","This book is the epitome of what a sports book shouldn't be. Mythical stats are surrounded by poor grammar that's hard to read and follow. The highlight of the book is truly it's first chapter on the first game ever. Unfortunately, the book goes down from there."
5,"Tainted Lake is mysterious, sexy, and really scary.","Wow! I couldn't put it down. It really draws you in and won't let you go. Tainted Lake is mysterious, sexy, and really scary. Alister Jak has an amazing talent for telling stories. And, in my opinion he's probably the embodiment of the horror fiction future. It really was a ""ghost story for grownups""."
1,awe inspiring- and NOT in a good way,"I bought this book because I am a huge fan of horror stories and it seemed to have great customer reviews. It was the ultimate waste of time and money. The dialogue was laughable and so pointlessly detailed, to the point where what each and every person at the table ordered to drink was written about. Some parts were mildly creepy but mostly just annoying and childish. If you're looking for something to really freak you out, keep looking. The writing itself distracts far too much from anything that might have been decent about the plot. Atrocious."
4,"Great story, Verrrry creepy","I've just recently finished this book. Yes, there are some things that are not ""great"" about it. The dialoug sometimes is forced and other times the ""lovey dovey"" dialoug is hurried and not fleshed out. With those being the ONLY two things I found wrong with book it's an EXCELLENT read. There are scenes in there that give me goosebumps when I REMEMBER reading them! Not to mention the delicious fear I experienced when I was reading the book.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and if you like to be scared, you will too."
5,This book is the best on the subject.,I have found the flow of the so striking and the effect of it is almost immediate. This is a wonderful book and I recommend every serious learner of Linear Algebra to definitely have this book with him. No matter when but he will always find the book helpful.
2,poorly written text,"The author seem to forget that this is a higher mathematics course. His over-exciting (lots of exclamation marks) habit is annoying at best and distracting at worst. The book reads like a novel which I think is very immature for a higher mathematics text. If the student doesn't already know what the sigma symbol means, then maybe this isn't the class for them. Such juvenile definitions only added to the distraction. The book goes off tangent continuosly because the author is too eager to make students see the supposed beauty of Linear Algebra."
4,nice but needs a longer chain,It's a very nice but needs a longer chain at least for me. very well made.
3,The early years.,"I'm not sure what the point of this collection was, but it's the best of their first few releases. Included is ""I'll Drink To That"", ""Devils Night Out"", ""Cowboy Coffee"", and the big hit ""Where'd You Go"". Theres also odd but good covers of ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Enter Sandman"". At this point I think they need to drop a career-spanning ""Hits"" album, one that at least included ""Someday I Suppose"", and their biggest hit ""The Impression That I Get"", among others. If you're looking for just one of their discs, I'd highly suggest getting ""Live From The Middle East""."
2,An academic in need of a lot more,"Paglia has read everything. Good for her. She is also totally out of touch with the real world. All of her references are taken from books, books, books and pop culture. Her arguments never hold up once you analyze them in any depth. Don't be fooled by her way with words. Underneath it is a vacuum and the final effect is one of a very intelligent woman wasting her mind on utter nonsense and the debris of pop culture. She has nothing to say, but is satisfied to be a character in a culture where image is everything and substance is woefully lacking."
4,"Fun, Irreverent Ramblings by That Woman","I enjoy Paglia. This disqualifies me as an intellecutal which is fine.What a lot of people don't quite get is that this is suppossedto be funny and irreverent. She writes very well and she grabs your attentionand too bad to all her ""enemies"" who don't have her charm. That's life.It's not like people will be reading Naomi Wolf in the next century."
5,"Ruthlessly accurate, which can help nearly everyone.","Ms. Paglia... I find the substances of your books, public dialogues, and values contained therein nearly perfect in logic and useful meaning to societies and individuals. Perhaps your are before your time and ours. But without persons like you in this American society, there would be no seeds for other, better, healthier, and fair qualities of human life. Thank you. And I would like to meet you one day."
3,Not What I really Expected,"I was excited when I bought this book as I loved the Killer Angels, but after buying this book during a recent visit to Gettysburg I was a bit disapointed. Hartwig does not really say what is accurate in the novel, instead he argues against what Shaara writes. He focuses on Lee, Chamberlain, Buford, Longstreet, and a bit on Pickett and Armisted but virtually ignores the other characters in the novel. Tom Chamberlain, Ellis Spear, Kilrain, Trimble, Pettigrew, Kemper, Garnett, and Harrison. I was personally more interested in these minor characters than in the ones that I already knew about, and this nook did not expand my knowledge of them. To me, this book was ok but not really what I expected."
3,Simularities,"""One of the many simularities between goldfish and women is that they like anything that sparkles."" Just kidding, but it was a nice necklace, though I am not sure where it is today since the lady I gave it too is no longer in the picture, not that I think the necklace had anything to do with the seperation, but... you never know. Overall a nice necklace."
2,Subpar,"Though Blue Note saw fit to issue unreleased material from Jimmy's trio of 1961 that established Jimmy as a major musical innovator, this session is surprisingly bland and subpar. The trio renders the tunes competently but without the panache or vitality expected from this potentialy soulful and exciting trio as evidenced by their other Blue Note efforts. As much as I love this edition of Jimmy's trio, perhaps this session should have remained in the can."
5,good jump starter,I bought these to help me get started in the morning and also so I didn't have the jitters and the sugar high as with energy drinks. This works well.I get the energy I need with out side effects. I would recommend this product.
1,Waste of Money,I found these to be a complete waste of money. I took the max as stated on bottle & still needed a 2 hour nap!
4,carla's blast,"I CARLA DID VERY WELL LIKE THE ENGERY BOOST THAT IT GAVE ME, BUT FOR A FEW DAYS ,I FELT LIGHT HEADED, UNTIL I GOT USE TO THEM. BUT NOW IT IS OK, SO I WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE AS NEEDED."
5,Great Energy Supplement,These are some great energy supplements by Bally. They give energy all through the day without the jitters. I highly recommend these who need that extra boost. You can take 1-2 depending on your body's needs. They are also good for when you go walking or exercising.
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,"I used to have this book when I was four and I read it over and over and over. It's simple, calm and beautiful."
2,Nothing new under the sun,"I thought this book was going to intruduce NEW teaching strategies for foreign languages, but in the end, it came out as a summary of methodologies and activities already being in use. If you want a better book (and not so expensive!!!) get Superteaching by Eric Jensen (co-author of Joyful Fluency). I think the book is EXTREMELY expensive for the ""new"" information it provides."
4,good knife,"I like the knife; the blade is solid, it doesn't feel like it's gonna fold back on itself when pressure is applied, the blade is sharp and stays that way. I use this thing on cardboard boxes all day, have for months, and it's still razor sharp.It opens easily and has an ambidextrous thumbstud (my dad's a lefty, so I notice this). The whole thing is well built and last forever. My only complaint is it isn't as ergonomic as the other knifes I own (mostly gerbers and kernshaws). The handle is a bit broad for how short it is; but that's my only complaint. I put my blades through real abuse at work and out camping, and this one takes it well."
3,Great Workout - Terrible Editing,"The workout was great as always, but the editing is enough to make you dizzy. A lot of the time they don't keep one camera angle or distance for more than one count. And if you missed the instructions, good luck with the camera angle showing you what you're missing. It may look cool, but not practical to watch."
1,HUGE Disappointment!!!!,"I would NOT recommend this DVD. It is a serious disappointment. The graphics are poor. Anna does her routines in front of an obvious static set that is more distracting than calming. The cardio section is weak. She dances around and looks rather ridiculous. She is also off beat several times. I expect that a cardio workout would be more involved. There is none of the umph or even excitement that she has in the Dance the Chakras DVD (which I also have and would HIGHLY recommend).I have 11 Ana and Ravi DVD's. All of which I adore! This Cardio, Stretch, and Strengthen is so far below their typical quality that I am surprised that there are so many positive reviews for it. If you get a Ana Ravi DVD, skip this and go for their older workouts. You'll be glad you saved the cash."
3,Not overly impressed,"I have been doing yoga for about 4 years and have been unable to attend my yoga class recently so was looking for an alternative to heading to the studio. I read excellent reviews for Ana and Ravi's DVD's so I thought I would give them a try. I was not at all impressed. Although the yoga did provide me a workout, the cardio part was rather lame, to put it politely. I was looking to get my heart rate up and found myself doing my own workout throughout the cardio session. I would not suggest this DVD for people who have been practicing yoga for any length of time, or for people who are looking for a great cardio workout!"
3,"OK, but not if you are out of shape","I just put this dvd in and could not do it. I am too out of shape and going into plough was hard enough, but then sitting up? Forget it...you must be in shape for this dvd. Sadly, I also prefer the old dvds with calmer music and less talk. I will try this again, after I use the old dvds for a few months, and am feeling brave and fit."
4,Kundalini & Cardio Together as ONE!,"This is one fun DVD. It's got the new set, new music, and new look for Ana. (Keep your eye out for her in her white Doc Martens for the cardio segment!)You will probably want to wear shoes for the cardio portions of this DVD as they suggest. There is some impact in the cardio moves, and depending on the comfort & health of your feet shoes are a good idea.It's yoga and it's cardio. Great combo, great results.Read some of the other reviews for a break-down of the exact content of the DVD."
4,great sound,"sound is better than ever, if you dont ear difference is a problem of equipement, i already have the original jacket edition and this is superior in sound, like the other people im in trouble with sony, if you purchase this item, you are a serious collector , why dont ask for more money but give a complete libreto and info, this is the only problem with this edition,dont hesitate in buy these cds, only the ballets cost more in separate cds"
4,Nice muffler,"Like most of my Amazon orders; I recieved this order ahead of time and in good shape. My truck does have a better sound now. Sounds good and not too loud from idle to about 2500 RPM. When you step on it; It sounds REALLY good! Not sure that I am getting more performace as I have only had it installed for about a week now. Seat of the pants...maybe some. I do hope I get some MPG benefit by vertue of less restriction and a new K&N air filter. That has not been the case in town according to the trucks computer. Probably because I have had my foot in it more just to hear that Hemi go! Overall, I am happy with it."
4,"Well-written, no punches pulled","Hyam walks a thin line in this book, that between the Scylla of condoning or trivializing concubinage and the Charybdis of its single-minded condemnation. He begins with non-technical coverage of the psychology of sexuality, and proceeds to contrast official attitudes and the Purity Campaign with imperial scandal and many highlights from individuals important in the history of British Empire. He is convincing in his central thesis on the origins of these conflicts. This book focuses mainly on India, and deals particularly with how British sexual attitudes influenced race relations."
5,a great book on Hsing Yi Chuan,This book is the best on Hsing Yi that I have ever read. Master Liang Shou-yu's exposition is thorough and clean. The inclusion of the Hsing Yi classics is a stroke of genious as these texts are seldom available in English.
3,Pedestrian,"Although this opera was composed at a time when Rossini was churning out some of his best work, Torvaldo e Dorliska is not an outstanding opera. Few numbers really can catch fire and it is indicative that the extent to which Rossini later used this opera as a quarry for use in other operas is comparatively limited, though some of the best pieces did later show up in other works. Unfortunately, the cast, orchestra, chorus and conducting in this recording are hardly more than adequate, so that it never really produces excitement or even many memorable moments. It is however, apparently the only cd of the opera that is available. (I haven't seen the DVD yet.)"
5,Stellar Woods Is A Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book, even though it was given to my 10 year-old daughter to read! This book had mystery, adventure and kept the readers attention. It is a great example of team work between a brother and sister who are out to solve a mystery. It also highlights a great example of trust between parents and their children.I'm anxiously waiting for the sequel!!"
5,A must-buy for problem-solvers.,"This book has proven: The olympiad problems are not so hard as they appears. For every problem, there is a valuable solution outline ,teaching us how to attack it in a natural way. Furthermore, here is a good list of reference books."
5,Very usefull book.,"I teach students, a mathematical olympic team, and this book will help them to get the training they need in order to have more medalls and achievements in their carreers. It has everything they need to do their exams and practice."
1,Bad science,I bought this book used for 30 cents. I overpaid.there is no aids conspiracy.There is no plot to create genocide.this book is a waste.
5,excellent book,i read this book when it was new or should i say slightly used as it was 1973 and my friend mike k. had a used bookstore called books for everyone in watsonville ca. where i grew up between santa cruz and monterey ca on the monterey bay
3,Tried it with my Ukulele,"Nice pick, comfortable in the hand - good tactile feeling. But I learn (again) that I don't really like playing my ukulele with a pick. Added this product to a larger order I was already making. Info says ""3 pack"" but I received only two picks in the little bag. Not worth the effort to follow-up with company for a refund or fix to the order."
2,"If you like rubber picks, it's great","I tried out this pack of picks and really didn't like them. If you have tried rubber picks before, and you know you like them, go a head and make the purchase. If you haven't tried one, find a music store or a friend who has one and give it a go before you spend money on something that feels as odd as this does."
1,I thought high tech at first.,The only thing this is good for is to use as a shimmy. Can I get my money back please?
4,string separation and attack of a pick with the tone of finger style,"I use these picks on my 8-string made by Bayard Blain to achieve the string separation and attack of a pick with the tone of finger style. They are really excellent for this. The only negative thing about them is the soft rubber flakes of and gets on the instrument. It is almost microscopic and you can't see it, but over time, you can feel it. The good news is that it seems to wipe off fairly easily."
5,Finally a soft and gripping pick,"This is the 5th bass pick that I have tried, and finally this works great. It does not slide out your hand and has a soft tip with a nice sound."
5,"Pick choice is a matter of taste, but I like these","I have these in both medium and hard versions, and I like the sound they produce on my ukelele. They are significantly thicker than the usual plastic pick, so whether you like them or not will probably be a matter of playing style and what you are used to. But, at the price, it is easy to give them a try."
3,"Good bass guitar tone, sticky on strings, uncomfortable feel","The soft rubber makes a good Bass tone. The softness makes the pick grab the string and not slip over easily, so it requires more follow-thru effort and stronger grip to complete a pluck. This pick is 3 times thicker than most. The extra-thickness is discomforting if you're used to a normal heavy guitar pick."
3,"Good for slow strumming, but not much else","Got these to use with my classical guitar because I am not crazy about the sound of plastic picks. The sound is great, but you really cannot do any fast strumming with this pick, it just drags too much. If you are just doing simple strumming while practicing chords, this eliminates that plingy sound you get with a plastic pick. So, I like it, but probably won't use it much, especially as I improve and am better able to do different strum patterns."
1,wrong one,I do not know if this works well or not because it was not what I was looking for. They did not send the one that would fit my breaker.
2,Not what I expected,"This series of books seems really to be meant for pre-readers rather than kids who are beginning to read. The stories are very predictable. For example, in the story The City, every page goes ""I see the ________."" I was hoping for a set of books that was a little more challenging. The Bob books seem like a much better fit for my daughter. They are still very basic, but the pattern of the text differs from page to page so she actually has to read the words as opposed to memorizing the first page and going on autopilot for the rest of the story."
1,Did not advance my son's reading.,"My son really struggled with reading and this set really did not help him advance. When I finally came upon the BOB series, that is when he finally had his breakthrough. The difference I think is this book was repeating the same words with the insertion of the picture for the page, therefore my son was not ""reading"" the word but repeating what he memorized and inserting what he saw in the picture. With the BOB books, it used word families and varied sentences. The varying sentences made him actually have to pay attention to the letters and the sounds and the word families helped him apply the sounds to new words."
3,"Cute book, smaller than I thought","This is a really cute book, just be warned: It is only about 5x5. I've looked at all of the NIR books, and will probably purchase the higher levels in the near future. I was under the impression that this book had the removable books and stickers like the higher levels are supposed to have (I don't own them, so I'm not sure if they really do or not). This is just one little book, maybe about 1/2 inch thick, that has five stories in it and a couple pages at the end to explain to the parents how to use this book in helping their child read.I bought this book for my 5 yr old who starts Kindergarten later this year. I figured it would help her learn to read and maybe get a good head-start for school. I still think this will be a great tool. Amazon needs to update the description, as it states that it has 10 books and stickers."
1,Missing a screw,I got the set for my husband who loves everything chess. It was missing a screw out the box. He didn't tell me to a week later. He wants to find a screw on his own but I'm mad and want to return it. Not happy.
3,small but nice,Smaller board and set than expected. Hard to get protective paper off on the glass. It is a nice addition to my collection
3,"Good idea, but not the best setup",I like the game and overall think it is very nice. My biggest problem with the purchase was that the screws were too big to fit through the board. Ended up having to run a drill through them to make it a little bigger. Once that was fixed everything has been going well
4,Could be arranged better,"I bought this as a gift for an 18 year old family member who has won high-school chess tournaments several times. He really liked the game, but did comment that, with the three boards directly over each other, it was hard to keep track of where all the pieces were. He felt that if they were moved over just a bit, it would be easier. His uncle, who played several games with him, agreed. All in all, though, he was pleased with it and it's certainly a better tri-level choice than the mega-expensive ""Star Trek"" version!!"
3,Fun game...,"Enjoyable game, but a bit difficult to understand and apply all the rules. The directions were not crystal clear, therefore if left up to interpretation, the rules allow the game to go on forever."
1,What a waste of time!,"I was very disappointed in this CD set. Caroline spent most of the time talking about the pit falls of human nature and how wonderful she is as a healer. What an ego! I found myself zoning out so much that I don't even remember most of it. Save your money, but if you must purchase it-get it used."
3,Note to healers.....,"Note to healers......grow a pair. I felt that this was essentially Myss' message to the healing community. Her delivery is rather coarse and I felt that her personality quite often detracted from the point she was trying to make (really.......trickling indoor fountains annoy me too, but not enough to go on about it at length). If you need a tough love pep-talk, this is the guide for you. If you are looking for succinct practical tools without a lot of excessive opinions to carry into your healing approach or practice you might look elsewhere."
2,Healer or Dennis Miller ?,"As a medical practitioner who uses alternative healing methods I am an advocate of Caroline's approach, however this work is not very helpful. Despite the title, it is oriented ONLY toward psychic healers, and she rants excessively and it seems illogically at various sacred cows."
2,disappointing,"With a title claiming ""Essential Guide for Healers"", and having high regard for some of her other works, I was excited to hear this set. I was expecting a positive, motivational, educational, enlightening experience - instead, I was weighed down with her seriously negative attitued about what healing artists other than herself were bringing to the world. It was painful, but I listened to the entire 4 discs, waiting for some of the kinds of gems that have come from her other works. The 3rd and 4th discs were somewhat less negative than the first two, but disappointing is the best one word review for this work. Wasted money - I don't even feel good about passing it along to anyone else."
2,Essential Guide to Discourage Healers,"Although I feel much of Caroline Myss' work is incredible and her span and wealth of knowledge is priceless, this work is filled with discrepancy of thought, negative attitudes and a prevailing grudge against those who have chosen the field of alternative healing or healing arts. Her advice seems to be presented as though it is coming from a place of tough love, but it is not...it is just plain tough and discouraging. Because I have enjoyed so much of her works, I pushed through it and found many good kernels of truth, but you have to wade through a lot of negative and downright rude personal stories and 'advice' to get to something useful...I prefer the facts without so much negative commentary."
1,This book is really just a long ad for the IBS treatment center,"This book is really just a long ad for the IBS treatment center. It has some good basic info, but all that info could have been summed up in about 10 pages. I went to the IBS treatment center web site. It is listed on every page of the book The web site sells probiotics that are much more expensive than anything else I have seen. They also offer medical services if you go to their center.I don't know anything about the IBS treatment center. Maybe it is a good place. If you want to buy a long advertisement in book form, you might like this book."
5,A+,Nicer and sturdier than the other desk organizers I looked at. Didn't wobble either like an organizer I had before. Looks good on my desk too!
4,Ziggy Soul-Dust!,"When I first bought this collection on 8-track in '74 I was shocked: gone were the glam trappings and slick production of his studio efforts. Kudos to Bowie then and now for pushing the envelope with regard to his image and musical direction. Sure there are a few missteps, but what you gain in return is a sweaty, live, r & b fueled gig with jazz overtones. Worth the price of admission just to hear David Sanborn's sax riffing and session legend Herbie Flower's amazing bass-lines which evoke aural visions of Jamerson and Jemmott."
4,David Live....revisited,"I've had David Live on cassette, vinyl, and now of course on CD. I truthfully have not listened to David Live end to end in 20+ years. The CD sounds really great! If they've cleaned it up or digitally re-mastered the CD they did a nice job. This is David at his peak (in my opinion of course) and is a must own CD 2-disc'er. Not any deliberate ""voice overs"" so common to Live recordings either A plus."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"I am stunned that this album receives ANY favorable reviews. I am a Bowie fanatic, having taken in a dozen of his shows stretching back to 1978, and have owned every album of his. This is not just his worst album....it is THE worst live album EVER by ANY performer. The arrangements are sloppily played/plastic soul cum art rock and I am sure his whole band is embarassed at how they sounded on record. As bootleg aficionados know, there ARE good shows from the 1974 tour. This album somehow manages to give them a complete miss. As for David himself, he is in the nadir of his cocaine addiction and simply can NOT sing here. His voice is Awful throughout, making even this hardcore Bowie fan cringe!! Buy ""Stage"" instead--when he was not coked to the gills croaking out plastic soul in front of a band that could not care less--what a difference a few years makes."
3,You get what you pay for,"This chair is a very nice price, but don't expect much from it. You get what you pay for. Not very comfortable."
4,GOOD AFORTABLE CHAIR,"VERY GOOD CHEAP TASK CHAIR IF YOU TAKE CARE OF IT << THEN IT WILL LAST FOR A LONG TIME < I bought this chair in FEB 08 now it is Oct 08 , it is still like new , very good I'm happy with this chair , great price.."
3,Spaced out,"This partners worked well in movies and now on CD. Nimoy, surprisenly, sings. Shatner used to sing in everywhere, but Spock was something different..."
3,"Good, not great",In my humble opinion:Spaced Out is good and worthwhile to me as it supplies the only recordings of Leonard Nimoy songs in my collection. Just owning a rendition of Mr. Nimoy singing the Hobbit song alone is worth the entire purchase price to me.I do hope that Mr. Shatner and Mr. Nimoy enjoyed making these recordings. They have earned more than enough laurels in their long and distinguished careers entertaining us to be allow leeway in the remainder of their careers for fun and experimentation in whatever endevors they choose.
4,A good piece of music to cure a nasty hangover.,"The music of Leonard Nimoy isn't all that bad, I could listen to him any day. William Shatner's music is so bad it is funny to listen to. At least he is not as Bob Dylan, with William Shanter he is an amateur, with Dylan he is professional. Why do people say he(Dylan) is great and Shatner is bad? It is great medicine to get rid of a nasty hangover. I find his lyrics very overdramatic like when he narrated ""Rescue 911"". He is a weird individual, but I do appreciate the Shakespearian twist to modern rock songs. If you want to get some more laughs see Marlon Brando on ""Guys and Dolls"" it is a musical with Frank Sinatra. I can see a tough guy breaking into song and dance. Shatner is doing Pricline Commercials with his singing as a joke now, but when he recorded the album he was so serious."
4,Really fun for diehard fans,The Nimoy offerings really make this fun to listen to. There is quite a bit of variety and more than a few surprises.
1,What a pile of cack!,"Some of the songs sung in here (namely Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds) were absolutely fine in their original form when sung by the legendary Beatles. William Shatner has taken this masterpiece and rung it's neck, kicked it in the head, and I am deeply offended by this rendition. Apart from that it's a funny album. The problem being, it wasn't meant to be a comedy."
1,startrek lost,"I would like to say that bill shatner can sing as good as he can act. But i won,t. He can't even carry it. His voice is one of the worst i have ever heard, and if he took singing lessons for years he might just work his way up to awful. As long as you don,t take it seriousy' it's o.k. sort of. But anything you could think of would be better. He even sings worse than my brother' and that is saying a lot. nuff said."
4,Shatner and Nimoy take flight!,"First Shatners Lucy in the sky with Diamonds has to be heard to be believed- its lunacy and camp at its best. Suprisingly Nimoy's vocals are pretty decent in a deep monotone baritone kind of way(think Leonard Cohen) and his song selection of classic 60s folk and pop numbers are top notch- in fact i find myself listening to his versions more than the orginals.But theres alot here to laugh at - the spoken word stuff by both Star trek legends is hilarious as well as the instrumental songs. But dont be suprised if you dig some of Nimoys stuff- in particular Everbody's talkin-If i were a carpenter and Both sides now. Ps- the ""ballad of bilbo Baggins"" should have all tolkien fans doubled over in fits of laughter."
5,Get ready to have your mind TRANSFORMED!,"In the..... jingle-jangle mornin'...... I'll.... come followin' you.......Genius, Shatner. It is like the face of God has been etched into your musical career and transformed into the purest, most beautiful sound ever."
4,For the love of everything horrible,"Shatner and Nimoy give new meaning to the phrase ""music appreciation"". Definately check out ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and ""Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town"". If you're teased by Shatner's Priceline commercials then this is a must have!"
4,Bizarre!!!,"This CD is crazy, but fun. The best part are the William Shatner songs, especially Mr. Tambourine Man. It is total fun and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. While there are no duets, it is well worth buying this."
4,to go where no man has gone before,"i would have given this cd 5 stars but there was just somthing missing. it mighte be mr. scotty doing a bagpipe solo, or mr soolo playing the skin flute, or bones haveing a drum solo in the middle. i'm just not sure i konw its missing somthing, and that something is missing from your colletion."
5,Great Deal on Heavy Duty Work Supports,"The finish is not perfect but it is still pretty good. The fit is excellent and as good as one could expect for this type of item. The supports do what they were designed to do and do it very well. I use them to support milling machine tables, metal shaper rams, etc. as they are being removed from the machine for maintenance and/or repair. Using a connecting bracket between support posts on two of these (to prevent tipping), these supports (both individually and collectively) easily supported a 1,800 lb. table off a Cincinnati milling machine. These supports are well worth the money they cost on Amazon ($108 ea. plus free shipping). They are much more expensive elsewhere. For the money they cannot be beat."
3,Palmgren Changed the Color,"A little disappointed in this product. When I ordered it the description and picture showed the color as blue, when i got it the color was gray. I paid around $135 for it at Amazon Jan. 1 now it is $108."
3,Silverado Cool,"The product was easy to install, just wear glove to keep from getting your hands cut on the radiator cooling fins. When I installed the cooler the temperature was 104 degrees in Kansas. Needless to say my transmission temperature was getting a bit high also. After installing the transmission cooler the transmission fluid had a lower temperature of about 18 degrees. Now that the weather has cooled considerably the transmission fluid stays in a more acceptable range. It took about 25 minutes to install, and works as advertised. Make sure to order the correct fittings along with your cooler."
1,Not quite what I expected,I was very surprised when we opened this set at the extreme fundamentalist Christian Propaganda printed on these cards. Science made over - in the image of the theory that men and Dinos lived on earth at the same time. I had not read the review of this product and had I known its content was not a scientific one I would not have bought this. We just glued the cards to index cards and wrote the facts of each Dino on those. I would not recommend this.
3,Good practice ball,I have used this Mikasa balls since I was little in south America. This ball is very hard and its great to practice your shot but most people in the U.S. won't want to play with it.
5,The best soccer ball,"tried a lot of soccer balls but this by far is the best soccer ball, great price and perfect for all types of soccer fields."
3,Mikasa Football FT-5,"The Mikasa FT-5 football is the ball used for the Brazilian created soccer-volleyball game, and usually has a good durability and does not loose its shape. The last one that I purchased, however, has been desinflating very often, which is unusual for this type of ball."
2,Doesn't have feel of a good soccer ball,"This ball's shell is altogether too hard for a quality soccer ball, and it feels too heavy. I'm returning mine."
3,nice ball but ....,Its a good soccer ball but its little heavy. The ball is water proof which is great for wet condition but bounce and swing of the ball is not tradition soccer ball like.
5,Best Soccer Ball Out There for You and I,"This is one of the best if not the best soccer ball for those of us who do not play in professional sports arena. Forget Nike and Adidas, their soccer balls lose air and shape constantly and are made of poor quality synthetic materials. This soccer ball is the preferred choice for the hardcore soccer players in Flushing Meadow-Corona Park in Queens NY. Flushing is the Mecca of soccer in the NYC area. I have played there with people from all over the world; Brazil, Colombia, Peru, England, Ecuador, Argentina, Germany, Russia, Belgium, France... just to name a few.This ball maintains its shape and its air. I pumped my ball the first time I got it and have had no need to pump air into it again. I have had the ball for over a year now and sometimes I do not play with it for weeks, and it never loses air.Unlike Nike or Adidas' soccer balls which I have to pump week in and week out this ball is awesome... don't waste your money on any other ball."
4,Not to be ignored,"Batchelor's major work of Cold War fiction floored me the first few times through. His gift to tear into the other side of the U.S/S.U. rivalry, showing both the very worst of Soviet repression and the kind of searing love-of-life felt by characters once they escape the watchful Soviet eye, is possessed by very few. Never feeling like a Soviet apologist or a ""Raa raa, horray for our side"" jingoistic US enthusiast, Batchelors work touches on Orwell's but never feels simply derivitive or hollow. He is a challenging, intense and unique writer and anyone who falls at the feet of Tom Robbins or loves the work of Don Delillo would do good to tackle Batchelor's writing, both this novel and the very wonderful, ""Birth of the People's Republic of Antartica."" Enjoy."
5,Need to own,"This came highly recommended by major guitar makers and works very well. As always, Amazon delivers quickly and for the best price!"
5,Great Toile Bag...,"This bag is very roomy and convenient for use with my growing family. There are plenty of pockets, a nice changing pad, removable storage containger, and a removable tote. The removable storage container is insulated making it perfect for storing breastmilk or wet clothing. The removable tote is another great feature, especially for parents with more than one little one. This bag is by far my favorite due to the convenient features and the BEAUTIFUL design. The black outside is very nice looking and the toile pattern is beautiful yet masculine enough for dad to carry with pride. This bag matches my graco carseat, duo glider double stroller , and quattro single stroller PERFECTLY! If you are a fan of convenient and nice looking diaper bags, this is the diaper bag for you!"
5,"Educational, enlightening, and amazing!","John Vacca never ceases to amaze me with the wealth of information he is able to put into a very concise yet understandable format. His latest book, Satellite Encryption, is no exception. John's books take you by the hand and guides you down a path of very complex subjects and issues, making sure you don't get lost. In the end you will feel the journey was well worth the effort."
5,Coconut Flour,"You cant go wrong when it comes to Bob's Red Mill. It is a good product. Clean, delicious, and fair price."
5,Smells yummy,"I've mostly used this for dog treats because coconut is great for dogs, and they really like the flavor A LOT! I mix it with a can of pumpkin, two eggs and some dehydrated beef (Paw Naturaw), and then either spread our on partchment paper, or extride with a cookie press and dry out at 200 degrees F until crunchy. They love it, and it has plenty of fiber to keep the anal sacs healthy."
2,Not sure if it is the brand or the coconut flour in general,"Absorbed all the liquid in my recipe and as a result the end product didn't taste very moist. I haven't tried other coconut flours, but if they all work like this, I would stick with rice flour for gluten free baking"
2,terrible taste,"this is one of those things that smells better than they taste. the taste is just awful. food suppose to taste good. also it takes just a few spoons to fill the recepie, and there is not space for a regular flour. but two spoons is enough to screw up the whole thing, and sugar and vanila wont hide it!and folks, loot at the price of this thing! i would think it is a good sub for those with gluten intolerance....and that is about it"
1,Processed in a plant that also processes tree nuts,"Absolute bummer!I am looking for alternatives to everything else and coconut floor seemed like the ideal ingredient, but having kids with severe tree nut allergies forces me to return or donate this box of flour.:-("
2,Coconut Flour,"I am not pleased with the results of baking with coconut flour. The levening doesn't seem to work when coconut flour is an ingredient. I will try to use it up, but I won't buy more."
5,Bob's Red Mill Organic Coconut Flour,"I like the flour, but it is difficult to find recipes and know how to use it in conjunction with other flours. If you love to cook and are an experimental type of person, you can really have some fun with this. If you are an average cook who is interested in not having any disappointments, this is not for you. By the way, it is a very healthful alternative for people who need gluten free products."
4,Good for special recipes,"The only recipe I've used this for where its been a hit was in my zucchini bread - I add an extra cup of freshly shredded zucchini to the wet ingrediants, and a 2/3 cup of coconut flour to the dry ingrediants. It soaks up some of the moisture, but the bread is still moist and has good consistency and a great coconut aftertaste."
5,"""Ocean is mine.""","I first heard about Swarm of the Lotus when they released ""When White Becomes Black"" and I was so amazed by it, buyt unlike another users review, I find it to be a perfect record. It was like if you combined the sounds Isis and Mastodon together.""The Sirens of Silence"" picks-up where the first full-length left off. Now they're incorporated more of Neurosis's sound into their style, and I'm glad they were able to progress and grow as a band writing better music than before. I believe the key tracks on this record are: ""Hookworm"", ""Yan Huo"", ""Snowbeast"", ""Vertigo"", & ""House at the Bottom of the Sea"".I hope that many people hear Swarm of the Lotus and see that they are one of a kind!"
1,disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Serpieri's work, yet this book is a collective of his least impressive left over work. The book has few pictures compared to the number of pages because opposite from the picture page is a page with brief commentary. A lot of empty white space is in the book. Many of the sketches are very crude. A better book would have showed the process by which Serpieri gets to his fully finished pictures. If you want quality Serpieri buy his other books. This one is a stinker."
1,A book-length piece of tabloid trash,"This book is nothing more than a sorry attempt at trying to make the life of man who shys away from the limelight seem sensationalistic. Throughout the book the writer seems to be dieing to reveal some bit of scandal, some skeleton in the closet of Stanley Kubrick, and he fails at it repeatedly. Baxter writes like a smug, holier-than-though iconoclast who deeply resents the success of the man he writes about. This book is fit only for the grocery store tabloid rack and even then it wouldn't sell because Kubrick has led a sober and quiet life only surfacing every ten years or so to deliver a quality film to quality-strarved audiences. If you want to read a decent biography of Kubrick, check out Vincent Lobrutto's book..."
2,Baxter Not A Kubrick Fan,"One comes away from this book with the impression that the author didn't really have his heart in the subject matter. This is a kind assessment, because Baxter writes of Kubrick in a tremendously unkind light, highlighting the filmmaker's seemier side.As a long-time Kubrick fan, I felt like I needed to take a shower after reading Baxter's bio. Could Kubrick really be as terrible a person as Baxter makes him out to be? One wonders if Baxter was snubbed by Kubrick in the research phase of the book and took it out on the man in the writing.There are some interesting tidbits, though. I particularly liked finding out about Kubrick's method; he doesn't write shooting scripts - he writes outlines and then suggests dialog and works with his actors during the shoots.Not for everybody. Certainly not for people who want analysis of Kubrick's films (there isn't any)."
3,Enjoyable read for non-expert movie lovers.,"Helps you realize why you love Kubrick, if you can read between the lines and if you don't get fixated on the tales of Kubrickophobism. While entertaining, they are not all that the book is about. The author does not present Kubricks work in 5-syllable Aestheto-socio-philosophical terms, nor does he fuss about the geometrical aspects of panning and scanning, yet he encourages you to re-visit Kubrick, and multiply your viewing experince!Not a text book, for sure!"
2,Does Baxter hold a grudge against Stanley Kubrick?,"While providing the occasional interesting insight and backstage tidbit, one gets to wondering what this book really has to offer. Baxter seems set on focusing on every alleged obsession, eccentricity, shortcoming, peeve of Stanley Kubrick. And to what purpose? In the end, we know some particulars about Kubrick, but the filmmaker remains as much a mystery to us as when we began reading. And perhaps that is the way it should be."
5,Best diaper rash cream ever,I have three children and one on the way. I would not use anything else! It is the BEST! I recommend it to all parents.
4,Works,I used to play table tennis years ago and just recently joined a local league to get back into it. I was looking for a decent all around racket that didn't have too much power or spin and this serves my purposes. I've been using it for a couple of months. Keeping it in a case and rubber clean after matches and it's holding up well.
4,Pretty Good Racket,I still use this racket today and I got it for Christmas of 2010. I love it. It allows me to play a great defensive game and also have some great attacking. It has improved my backhand which was a lot weaker than my forehand and it has great control. It lacks a lot of spin but the control and the power is pretty good. Keep in mind I said pretty good for power. It is not very fast but it can do the job depending on your level.
2,Not a very Good product for your value,Please do not go by the sale price. Other Rackets for the same price (but not on sale) are better than these.Wouldn't recommend for the price.
3,Didn't get a whole lot out of this book,"I did not get a whole lot out of this book. I'm not even sure I really learned anything from it, all I know is that I had to buy it for school."
4,"The soundtrack to the movie ""Claudine""","I've been searching for so long for the CD or DVD to the 20th Century Fox 1974 movie ""Claudine"" for sooo... long. I know that Curtis Mayfield scored, wrote and produced this soundtrack and Glayds Knight & The Pips added their soulful sound to this film. Also, the CD was reissued and was produced by Tom Cartwright. Please help me find this DVD or CD."
2,Not that impressed,"I bought this for my now 3 year older daughter. It would not stay on her graco carseat. The toys were boring and when she grabbed them it fell over. Later, she could just push the whole thing over."
2,"Nice idea, but hard to clip on","This is a nice little clip on toy to entertain your child, however, it is very hard to clip onto my daughter's Quattro Tour Latch Travel System (Graco). I was able to get it on, after about 20 minutes of work, but it wouldn't stay in an upright position. Before you buy this toy, make sure that your stroller or carseat, etc. has a thin bar/rail that the toy can be attached to.One bonus- it did fold very easily and fit nicely into my daughter's diaper bag."
1,DOES NOT CLIP TO A GRACO INFANT CAR SEAT!,"I bought this to attach to my daughter's infant car seat. Big mistake! It did not stay clipped and kept falling down on top of her. I then bought the Tiny Love Sunny Stroll Arch as a replacement as that has an adjustable clamp and though that clamped on ok, the clamp eventually cracked after 1 week of use making it both dangerous and un-useable. I am very disappointed in the Tiny Love stroller arches!"
5,"Happily ""taken"" with the Take Along Arch","We have been happily ""taken"" with our Take Along Arch. My baby has loved it. It has been the one toy we take with us to restaurants. We started using it around 1 month and continue to use it today (9 months). Initially, our little girl would enjoy looking at it, then began to bat it, then pulled it, and now mouths and touches the toys. The toys are removable so she can explore the textures and sounds. When she outgrew her infant carrier we began using it on restaurant high chairs.-Happy Mom & Dad"
2,Doesnt work as advertised,"This is a cute toy, I will give them that. And I didnt realize until much later that it played music. But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING. We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too. It collapses on everything, it falls on her. We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things. We could have done that with toys she already had. This was a waste of money."
1,Better products out there,"We didn't have this toy for long because it would not clip onto anything. I bought initially for the carseat on the road, (can't have the bar up while driving) but it wouldn't clip on to the carseat. It also didn't clip on to his bassinet. There was no point in having this toy, so we returned the item.As other people said it would collapse easily.Instead I use the Lamaze: Link Along Friends. I clip those to the hood of the carseat while driving. He loves to play with those toys."
3,Think Outside the Box...,"When I bought the arch, I intended to use it on my daughter's infant carrier. However, it would not attach. So, instead, I attached it onto her changing table. She just loved it, but as she pulled on the toys, the arch came off on one side. So, I put it at the foot of the table so she can kick the toys. Now we both love it! It's a colorful addition to her nursery."
2,Does not stay on,"I have a Graco Comfort car seat and this does not stay on. It is good in theory but if you have a 5 month old baby who likes to pull on the toys, it does not work. The clips need to be able to attach more securely."
4,So what?,"My freind bought this for her 6 month old son when he was bored in his carseat. He payed attention to it for a while and then just started ignoring it. It's just kinda boring for the kid, it doesn't really light up or anything, and that's what mine like."
3,Doesn't work well with Evenflo Car seat,I thought this arch was so cute (still do) but it is not very functional. I can't get it to stay on the Evenflo carseat. It keeps popping off. I have tried putting it in different spots and positions but you have to open the clips so wide to acomedate the thickness of the car seat that the clips loose there grip. kind of like when you have way to many papers in a paper clip. It does work very well with my Evenflo stroller but that wasn't really what we bought it for.
2,Not for the Peg Perego Venezia,"I bought this stroller arch because it seemed like it would be excellent entertainment for my baby. However, the arch did not fit appropriately on the sides of my Peg Perego Venezia stroller or my Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat. There is a great deal of cushioning on my stroller and car seat, and the sides where the arch should attach seem to be much wider than other strollers. Unfortunately, the stroller arch clips could not fit around the cushioning or sides. Kind of disappointed that I have to make another trip to BRU to return it."
4,Great item!,"We love the take-along arch! It is great because it can go on the carseat, the stroller, etc. I like it because it kind of rolls up so I can put it in the diaper bag or suitcase and ""take it along"". We rotate out the hanging toys for variety. The clips fit on the car seat pretty well, sometimes they slip off if I don't push them on all the way, but overall, a great toy for my baby."
1,Dangerous small parts,My daugher loved this arch her first few weeks. It cliped onto her bassinet nicely and she was able to just touch the toys to get them moving.I had trouble attaching it to either of my strollers and ended up taking the toys off for her to play with. The plastic eye on the bug came off. I called the company to let them know. They said that wasn't a problem they were aware of and offered to replace it. It isn't something I'd let her play with again or recommend.
3,Not quite right,"My very active 4-month old son loves this arch -- he can either kick at it or grab the toys -- but the height adjustment has loosened considerably and doesn't lock into any of the positions. It gets a little boring for him to have everything hanging so easily right in front of him. On the good side, it attaches easily to my Graco stroller -- it clipped to the handlebars when he was still in the infant seat and now clips to the frame very securely. The toys are no-frills but very colorful."
1,It is in the closet!,"I got this as a gift at one of my showers. It looked like it would be great, except it wouldn't stay clipped to anything. It actually popped off and hit my daughter in the face, so now it resides in the back of the closet. I wouldn't even put it in my goodwill box. It will probably end up the in the trash."
1,Great idea..poor execution...,It's a great idea to have a toy that clips on to any seat. It does not clip on to our Graco Snugride and even if I manage to get it clipped on somewhere my 5 mo old daughter has been able to yank it right off..so it's been pretty useless so far... dunno how else to use it... I've found other clip-on toys by Kids 2 and other more useful. Overall bad product if you have a car seat that it doesn't clip onto too well
2,"Great idea, great toys, doesn't fit",I think they made a really great toy. I like the idea of detatchable toys I can rotate or even substitute in. What is frustrating is that adjustability was not a concern in their design of this product. It definitely does not fit on the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Car Seat nor the Peg Perego Aria LB stroller. The clips on either end of the arch do not open very wide. I was very disappointed though--it would have been a great concept.
2,good for begininers,"having already done basics of belly dancing, this was a little easy for me, got bored of it very quickly. didn't learn anything new so i didn't like it much, but it'd be great for beginners who are new to the world of belly dancing."
5,Excellent for beginners,I've been taken belly dance class for about 3 months now. This is the DVD got introduce to beginners. It's very easy to follow and you can really have a good work out for your belly.
2,Novice Instructor,The vidio was ok showing the introductory moves but the dance portion of the vidio wasn't very good. The moves looked silly.At the end of the vidio it shows the instructor dancing. If I had seen this portion of the vidio first I wouldn't have bought the DVD. She looked like a novice to me.
5,"4 year old nieces loved it, they couldnt wait to decorate their own picture frame","I gave this to my twin nieces for Christmas, they couldnt wait to decorate their picture frame. My sister said they loved it. They are 4 years old and love crafty gifts, this was perfect"
2,Wrong size,"This frame does NOT hold a 3x5 picture. The frame itself may be 3x5, the but picture itself holds a wallet size. I was very disappointed by how small it was!"
1,very disappointing,The quality is very disappointing. I was going to give it to my granddaughter but gave it to the wastebasket instead. Don't waste your money.
5,"Everyone needs a Wombles CD, and this one's it!","This double CD picks up all the 'womble hits', and is really the only one you need unless you're a hard core wombles fan. The lyrics are clever, and the way they borrow(?)/satirize(?) such a wide variety of musical styles is wonderful. This stuff is up there with Animaniacs, but more musically oriented and less commercial. A nice present for either kids or adults."
2,Not What I've Come To Expect,"Lunges and squats - two things that absolutely kill my knees. I was very disappointed that the ""meat"" of this workout included 17 minutes of exercises that I will have to skip because it had my knees aching for days afterwards. This dvd reminds me of everything I hate about typical gym class workouts and traditional workout videos. I absoutely adore the Fat Free, Warrior, Ultimate Stretch, and Yoga Body Beauty workouts from Ravi and Ana. The new scenery, repetitive music, and assessory changes throughout the video were also very distracting to me. I'm afraid this one will be gathering dust on my shelf. Very disappointed after waiting over a month for it to arrive."
5,Star Power High Energy Workout!,"I've been taking Kundalini Yoga classes on and off for the past couple of years and I have to congratulate Ana & Ravi on this excellent production. This is the best of the ""old school"" Kundalini workouts combined with Ana & Ravi's genius innovations which make it even better and cutting edge. The exercises felt like balm for my hips and joints. I worked up a sweat and I have to say, the way they present the workout imbues it with a high fun factor. Like someone else said, I felt that this one made me feel expansive and great, filled with star power! I feel like trying out for something, and I'm not even an actor! The upper body work is killer. My arms and chest and shoulders feel it in a good way. This dynamic duo has really outdone themselves with this great workout!"
3,Great workout but who are they fooling,"This is a great workout. I love the combination of cardio and yoga. New stretches that I have yet t see. Ana's execution of the movements is beautiful. Her and Ravi have nice sounding voices.Though, what is up with the music? At one point, it's like a mix of hinduism and hip hop. Not a good combo. Then there is the music segments that sound like I dream of genie, a mix that sounds like sirens/alarms, and I'm pretty sure that you could sing ""Lowrider"" by War at one part. Oh so weird.Also, the background. I understand that it is suppose to be tranquil, but if they want to have an outdoor background, they should be outdoors or at least find a place with big windows overlooking the water. It looks like someone made it on SIMS. It's very fake looking or f you are going to have something like that, make sure it looks real, ie. have the water moving,leaves rustling in the breeze, something. Especially if you have a ""breeze"" flowing through Ana's hair."
2,not what you would expect & hope for from them,"I also was disappointed in this DVD. I am a little confused as to what it is about...is it a cardio/yoga class like the ones offered at the gym? or is it kundalini yoga? I'm leaning towards the cardio/yoga gym class type. The way I feel is that if I wanted a cardio workout I can go for a walk, a run, or jump around my house for 30 minutes which is kind of what this routine felt like. I own all of their DVDs and I was expecting somehting much different. Does anyone even know if this could be considered kundalini yoga?? I wanted more of a workout that works from the inside out...this one seems to focus on the outside too much..i'll try it a few more times and see if I change my mind.."
5,What's So Good About Kundalini Yoga,"In my opinion, this DVD is the best representation of Kundalini Yoga that I've experienced so far. What I love about Ana & Ravi's style is that they are so encouraging and the instruction is first rate, so you're getting the best of ancient and new: the depth of yoga with cutting edge fitness. You always feel with their DVD's that you're in good hands and before you now it you've completed an exercise which has taken you to a totally new level of personal breakthrough. With the Matrix Menu option, you can customize this DVD and work out for a week and never do the same workout twice. In this time of economic strain, I feel that this is a much better bargain than taking live yoga classes!"
5,perfection,This is probably the most fun I have ever had working out. Period. The moves are very original. Its extremely relaxing and energizing at the same time. You feel amazing during this entire workout. Ana has perfect form. Ravi's queues are great. The color/ music scheme is wonderful. I don't want to ramble but yes. You should buy this. Yes you will like it. As far as I can see this video has no bad reviews. I used to be a huge fan of rainbeau mars but after doing this I think I am going to be sticking to Ana and Ravi from now on!
4,It Has a Place in my Raviana's Collection!!!!,"I love MANY of the Raviana's dvds and I have most of them. This DVD is pretty good BUT is not my favorite Raviana DVD; However, it still has a place in my collection!I got a pretty good workout with this, especially on the Superset segment, where Ana includes kundalini style squats & lunges! I found the Tiger Claws segment very challenging. This is where you move your arms up and down from the side for quite a long time... I think this exercise is more mental than physical.... yes my arms were burning a lot but you also need the mental strength to complete this segment. The music on the workout was great!!!!Overall I liked this DVD... the reason why I gave it four stars is because Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen rocks and I enjoy it better than this workout!!!! This is a good Kundalini practice though :o)"
4,Outstanding EP,"Everything recorded around this Come on die young period is stellar..In many ways i wish the band never outgrew the stark formats that in my opinion pushed them farther as musicians then anything has since..Some truly beautiful gems here, almost too good to believe they just didn't put it on CODY and make it the ultimate album of that year..The material is a little more cheery (cheery-ha!), then that of CODY but would have worked well in contrast to so many of that album's empty feelings.."
3,A volume that focuses strictly on Euro dance,"While this series has a good mix of Euro and US club hits, this volume is almost predominantly unfamiliar to the US market. My hope was to finally have the ORIGINAL european mix of Baltimoro that was out well before this song ever hit the states, which had a completely different intro, but this is the US mix!!! bummer. Track times:1. vamos a la playa (4:31)2. u got to know (5:11)3. boys boys boys (5:35)4. tarzan boy (6:13)5. everybody (5:15)6. papa chico (5:58)7. i like chopin (8:53)8. balla balla (5:57)9. stop bajon (7:08)10, Fun Fun hit mix (5:38)"
1,Garbage,Just plain garbage.. Didnt take a full charge..And little by little toke less of a charge.. I finally got tired and junk it about a week later..
2,Just buy a real one,I call myself being reliable and buying this cheap acessory. Never again....It never fully charged and as a week went by it died and since then only charges up to a bar or two..... I'm gonna buy a real microsoft one soon.
1,"battery are defective seller""eforcity"" itself is responsible they take care of the problem would buy again but not batteries.",I would buy from seller eforcity its not them its actually the batteries they look like cheap china made most of them are defectibe again ITS NOT THE SELLER its the prodct!should get all those batteries and throw them away.!!
5,An important correction,"Some remarks posted by the reviewer Christopher A. Stribley seems to be quite inaccurate:1) The songs featured on the DVD edition of the concert are the same present on the VHS edition.2) The concert in fact 'ends' with ""Voodoo Dolly"", but ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Spellbound"" are the songs featured on the bis, so it's factually correct to place them AFTER ""Voodoo Dolly"", as it really ocurred on the show.That said, I must only to agree with the other reviewers: ""Nocturne"" is simply ESSENTIAL."
2,Only slightly helpful,"This book is a light little read, and worth the price if you get it used for under 10 bucks. However, most of the articles are not as in depth as they should be. The author spends quite some time referencing other books for the reader to look into (some are horribly out of date). This book is mostly just a cursory glance at the real subject of changing your identity. I almost feel as if the author is simply trying to make more money by referencing other books he has written instead of putting in the effort to write one really helpful good book. So like I said worth it if you get it really cheap otherwise do some research yourself on the subject."
5,wow,"This stuff can't be legal! But, it did help me catch two deadbeats that skipped town owing several thousand dollars in unpaid judgements from evictions. Every tracer and landlord should buy this book."
5,Essential book for new mothers,"As a family therapist and teacher, I thought I was quite prepared to become a mother. In reality, I was overwhelmed by the abrupt changes in my life after having a baby. This book addressed my concerns in a caring, supportive and nonjudgmental way. It discussed issues that I had difficulty verbalizing, and it normalized my early experiences of motherhood. This is my top pick for every new mother - it is my staple gift at every baby shower!"
5,Finally a book for me!,"I have read many books about how to care for your newborn, but this book was about how to take care of me, after childbirth. Every question I had and wondered if I was being selfish, greedy, overly protective or just depressed was included in this book. It gave examples that I related to. I am very grateful to know that I am not alone with my emotions and experiences of being a new mom!"
5,DVD's are good products,"Lots of footage, but the narration is even better. The quality is very good and plays well in both player and computer."
3,the end of a world dominating dream,some of the black and white pictures have been seen before but now they have been processed and the quality of both the sound and the picture make it well worth the money.the five stories are really interesting and i would suggest that young people would get a sense of what was happening in the whole world in ww2.once again amazon has produced the goods
4,Schadenfreude,"I enjoy any documentary which depicts the defeat of fascism, particularly the defeat of Hitler. These films show that Hitler helped defeat himself because he exaggerated his own ability and made stupid mistakes. He underestimated Russia's ability to manufacture war materiel, to force its army to fight relentlessly, and of course the inevitable power of its climate. He underestimated the RAF and Churchill's leadership. Loyalty to his old political comrade led him to overlook Goring's talent for deception. He underestimated US industrial strength and motivation.All these errors born of a meglomanical ego are depicted in this collection."
1,...,"Is this a single cos it does not say wot it is or is it a album, it should say how many tracks it has on it. And i will be happy if u can email me back answering these qusetions.thanks"
1,garbage but.........,"I think this album is trash, I think Ice needs to quit while he has a little dignity left....maybe go back to the surreal life......but. Someone on here was ripping on all whit e rappers calling this ""a sin"" and ""filth"" and that hes the ""biggest joke in the industry.. Now, not defending Mr. Van Winkle, but how is it filth for him to do this but not EVERY OTHER RAPPER IN THE GAME???, Also, as far as ""white"" rappers, Eminem has talent, and when this ass came out he did too (for his time period). Also, he's not the biggest joke in the game. That title would be a tie.... Jay Z (because he got ripped apart by Camron.. Camron for christs sake!!!!) and of course, who could forget the talentless Benzino.. Benzino is the biggest joke ever.. I could rap circles around him, and I hate hip hop"
1,All flash and no dash,This book basically recycles lots of basic concepts from Mitchel Madison and others with a high tech wrapper in an attempt to make it more compelling and complex. The basic themes are simple enough to grasp. Fortunately it is a quick read although the numerous typos are a bit annoying. The many sourcing stories are fun to read for this so inclined.
3,not high quality,Not the best quality item. Seems cheaply made. No instructions on how to wind cable. It will do.
3,Average,"I bought this CD, because i like the live songs much better than the studio versions. However, this has to be one of the worst live recordings i have heard. It becomes hard to hear the band because the crowd is so loud, and while this is good in concert, it isn't very good on a live CD."
1,materialism disquised as theology,"Once again Mr Ham has taken a sophistic look at the world and written a book whose basis lies not in reality but in the author's beliefs. I suspect that the root cause of Mr Ham's obsession lie not in a misunderstanding of science but in a misunderstanding of Christ's message, ""My Kingsom is not of this world"". If God chose to use the Big Bang and Evolution to form His creation (as the evidence overwhelmingly indicates), then so be it. It does not alter the true message of Christ. His work is a continuing effort to intertwine materialism and theology. Basically an attempt to put God in a box. Just as I will never listen to a scientist attempt to explain God, I will not listen to a preacher attempt to explain science."
1,don't buy for your kids...,"Ham once again is teaching his extrabiblical teachings to our kids. Instead of teaching scripture, he is trying to profit from the new interest in dinosaurs for the benefit of his radical group. We need books that show real biblical teachings about science, not ones like this."
5,Mind body oracle insight,I really liked these cards.The egg type shape is new and can make routines for oracle shufflers a little challenging but the overall look and beauty far outweighs this aspect.The simple words and body mind insights make these cards a valuable tool for healers with clients and those working with themselves to drill into spiritual and body mind lessons.
2,Not sure about this,"I find these cards very difficult to use. Shuffling is impossible and and the instructions vague. That said, I still like and am intriqed buy the idea of these cards. I believe that you can change your thoughts and change your life (Dr. Wayne Dyer). I am still wiling to give the cards a chance."
2,pretty gross,"While some of the original artwork was intriguing, much of it was really obscene. I did like the collections of ""vintage"" cards and album art."
5,Sheer Excellence!!!,"I bought this cd and was immediately captivated by Marilyn Zavidows beautiful voice. If I had to describe this cd in one word, I think it would be ""Magnificent."" The title track, ""When You Least Expect It"" truly shows the wonderful talent of this amazing artist. Other particular favorites of mine are ""I Wanna Be Wooed"" which had me swaying back and forth from the melodious tune. Ms. Zavidow continues with her wonderfully humorous ""Valse Nasale."" If you really like the sound of Broadway, and appreciate the sound of a great female vocalist, I would sincerely recommend picking up this cd. Then, you'll find yourself singing these songs just ""when you least expect it."""
5,"Brilliant, Inciteful, Elegant...","This album is a revelation. Marilyn Zavidow's original songs provide beautiful and unique perspectives on life and love. I saw her cabaret show in New York, and this album captures the essence of that very warm and wonderful act. I cannot recommend this album enough, especially if you are a fan of sophisticated and thoughtful original adult-oriented music, something there is far too little of in this world."
5,"Very nourishing, satisfying thick soup","This is super easy, just be careful to lower the heat after it comes to a boil, it will scorch easily. It's delicious, very rewarding on a cold day.The suggestion to add more corn kernels is a good one; another addition could be sliced frankfurters or sausage. The chiles are not at all too hot;the soup would be too bland without them."
2,Seemed like a deal but...,"Seemed like a deal at the time but after noticing the size of the cans, not so much. I love the taste of this chili and after moving from Texas could not find it in Nevada I ordered a case. Won't do it again. Will suffer with Hormel out of the grocery store. The small can size, which I have never seen in a store is not worth the per can cost."
3,Good but not Great,"Percy is a strong little engine, but one thing that is an issue is that since it's is all wheel drive it will more easily drive off the tracks. Especially if you have a switching track. The diecast is really nice though with good detail. It's really a good looking little engine."
1,Doesn't work,Worked for the first hour or so and then it just stopped working. doesn't turn on at all now. my son really wants to play with it but it doesn't work/wheels don't move at all even with a new battery. will need to return this item sadly. would not recommend buying this.
2,Thomas battery engines: fun until they break,"We bought a pair of the metal, battery powered 'Thomas' trains and one stopped working almost immediately.Upon opening the case (required special triangle driver bits that we had to buy for $10) we discovered that a wire had come loose from the motor (factory solder job didnt hold). After getting all the necessary tools assembled (solder iron, solder, flux, etc) we repaired the motor.Trying to reassemble keeping the gears in place while replacing the body was very difficult. It worked great...for 30 min and now died again.My kids may drop the train from 1-2 ft high (they're 2 years old, so not any higher than 2 ft up), but a $30 metal clad toy should survive a 2 year old who isnt rough with it. I would NOT buy these again. It seemed like fun, but at $30 each + tools to repair...find your kids something else."
3,Percy Died!,"We bought battery-powered Percy for our 22-mo-old son for X-mas. He had no interest in any of his other X-mas presents after opening this one, and unfortunately this was the first thing he opened, so that was that. He has played with Percy EVERY DAY since X-mas, and suddenly Percy died- his back wheels no longer turn. I had hoped that for the price he would last longer than he did. I also must mention that he had some difficulty staying on the tracks in curves- and they were Thomas tracks, not generic. Percy kept falling off, especially when pulling cars. I suppose we'll be returning him, but after reading other reviews we may exchange him for two wooden engines instead- they don't break! And f.y.i.- Brio's and Imaginarium's battery-powered engines aren't much better- they use up batteries like I don't know what. On the positive side, Percy was thoroughly enjoyed by our son while he lasted, and he had more speed, power, and longer battery life than the Brio and Imaginarium engines."
3,"Okay, if played gently..","We have gotten both the motorized Thomas Tank Engine and Percy for our 2 and half year old son. Unfortunately, these things are quite easy to damage---the motor/mechanism can not withstand being pushed while operating for example.Better to get the Fisher Price Trackmaster Thomas sets for the same money--much more durable."
1,No Fun With Percy,"We have four battery operated engines (Thomas, Percy, Lady, James) and Percy was the second one purchased. We had Percy for two weeks when the switch would no longer work properly. The switch turned him on every other time, then completely stopped working. So, we returned him for another. The one we currently have does not stay on the track if you use the small curved track anywhere in the setup. But, Thomas handles it fine. There is no consistency from engine to engine. It is disappointing."
2,Doesn't stay on the track,"The engine comes off the tracks all the time - even when it is used with track of the same brand (Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway). This is a pain. Our child is frequently asking us to help to get it back on the track.But more importantly, it is a disappointment for the child. Our 2 year old was extremely excited about this toy when he opened the present. After playing with it a short while he said ""This train is bad. It's broken."" That's not the memory you want your family to have on Christmas.It doesn't seem like it should be difficult to make a toy train go around a track reliably. Don't buy this toy."
1,Correct train but it Doesn't stay on track,"This is the correct wooden railway train; however, it doesnt' stay on the track much at all. I purchased this for my son who loves Thomas and friends and he has battery-powered Thomas and James. Percy is another likable character so I purchased this for him for easter.However Percy runs off the track frequently especially around curves. You have to be sure the tracks are flush to one another and keep it that way which is not likely with a 2.5 year old. I believe this is because Percy only has 4 wheels as compared to the other trains, like Thomas, which have 6 wheels. I believe that center non-motorized wheel on the other trains work as guidance and keep it on the track. So this is annoying to keep putting the train back on the track continuously.All of these trains burn through batteries quickly so i recommend the lithium batteries. they have a little more power and last a little big longer."
3,It broke within hours of normal use!,My son got it for Christmas and it broke almost immediately! It was an internal problem. The light still goes on but the motor doesn't run. How sad for a $20 toy that was probably made for pennies in some sweatshop overseas. Luckily we will be able to return it.
1,size,"Very disappointed with wrong description. THE TOY IS SMALL. Nothing wrong with toy if you are looking for a small Percy, but when i check it was saying 5"". Well I was going to use that as a cake topper, end up having to buy another one and just waist time and money with time one."
2,Poor quality,We found the wheels were broken when we opened the package. The light was on but the train did not move after putting in the battery. We returned the product already.
2,It does not stay on the track.,Battery powered Thomas is great but this one (Percy) does not stay on the tracks.The battery life is good though.
3,Cheaply made,"This seems very cheaply made. The first one I received was broken. When it was exchanged, it works, but still feels cheap and like it will break with a little abuse."
3,"Fun, but makes annoying noise","My two year old son received a ""hand me down"" train from friends, after a few hours of play, it started making an annoying noise. We bought a new one, and the same thing started happening. It seems like something in the wheels/gears ""rubs"", the train slows down and makes a high pitched noise. My son keeps asking for the ""noise, choo-choo"", and I told him it went bye-bye."
3,Not as good as expected,"Basically, This is a nice toy train. My son does have fun with it. However, it is not as good as described in the product features. For instance, it is described that special magnet helps keep rolling stock on the track, buy actually it does not. In addition, the AA battery is not included although it claims."
2,PERCY Falls ALOT and Breaks!!!!,"My 2 year old son loves trains and his absolute favorite is PERCY!!!!! However of the battery powered trains THOMAS is the only one worth buying..... Percy has a lot of troubles navigating any turns at all on the wooden track, especially if you have any cars attached to him....And that is when he was working... Like many fellow reviewers on here, the Percy I purchased my son died after about 4 hours of my son playing with it, I replaced the battery with no luck.... Then magically 2 days later it was working again for about a week and now has been dead for about 3 weeks..... My son still plays with it because Percy is his favorite and the one nice thing is that you can use it as you would the wooden trains just pushing it around. Only recommend if Percy is your childs favorite but DO NOT Expect much..... Epic Fail on this one... :("
1,Do not buy this bad quality toy!!!,"I bought this for my daughter. It is such a disappointment!!!We put battery on Percy, looking forward to the action. But only the light lighted up, it won't run at all.I should have listened to some of the reviewers who said it has really bad quality.I have printed out the return slip. Percy will be on the way back to Amazon."
3,wait for appropriate age before getting this toy,"My girlfriend and I bought this toy for our 18 month old son. He enjoys pushing it around on his Thomas the train tracks, but presses too hard on it when he plays with it. This causes the wheels to stop turning, and you can hear the gears grinding. After about 3 months of abuse, the back 2 wheels no longer turn, and the front two are starting to go as well. I feel if we'd waited until he was older to give him the toy, it would have lasted longer. All in all, it's a great toy. It does derail quite a bit, but I blame the knock-off thomas tracks for that."
5,Noisy but lots of fun!,"Doesn't derail on well assembled track (i.e. corners are not excessively sharp or forced together because you do not have enough track to make a proper loose fit). It does keep up a fair bit of noise when running on battery power. When pushed while off (or on) it sounds like you are stripping the gears. You know that horrible noise made by a standard shift car when you do not get that clutch in all the way. It does not seem to harm Percy, just sounds horrible."
1,Broke after 3 days,"After 3 days of playing with it, my son's battery-powered percy died. He left it on while I was giving him a bath. When we finally found Percy, he was tucked away in the corner of our bed. He was hot, so I knew my son had left him on. I replaced the battery. While the light still works, the motor is completely dead. I would not recommend this product."
1,Poor Percy.,"This is our 3rd battery operated Percy and he needs to be retired. The price was fabulous but after 3 days of light play he was practically dead, replaced the batteries and within 24 hours he was crawling again. I think theses Percy trains all have a motor/battery issue. Don't waste the time or money on this one."
3,not well designed,"this engine looks great, but it has virtually no power, and more importantly the front wheels don't rotate at all, so if a track has any small curves in it, there is a derailment. most importantly, though, the battery wears out incredibly quickly. really disappointing."
2,Blurry pictures,"We bought this camera so we could take pictures while on land based excursions from a cruise ship. We had booked beach and kayak excursions and I didn't want to risk my camera to the water adventures. The price was right and I didn't really want to spend the amount needed to protect my Nikon from water as I figured only to take 20 or so pictures and probably never use the case again.The camera did and excellent job of taking pictures, but due to the protective case used to protect it from water, almost all my photos came out blurry. I'm sure that's due to the fact that the case is molded plastic. The camera outside of the case is fine for a simple 35MM."
4,Herencia,I recommend this for persons interested in learning the culture and advancing their learning of Spanish; it proceeds at an easy to follow pace.
3,Slow,"Slow and not very eventful, like many other Argentinian movies. (I have nothing against dialogs, except when they are commonplace and boring.) There are no subtitles, so open your ears !The positive aspect is that the actors are excellent."
3,not impressed,A few good instumental R&B numbers the rest are not impressive. Vocalists lacking and most songs boring! Bought based on the CD with Harrison and friends.
3,"Good intro to concepts, wanted it to have more examples","Reading through this book is a great introduction to the ideas of Feng Shui, the philosophy and such, but it does not live up to its title of ""How to Apply..."" I wanted to read little pieces of concrete suggestions to switch the chi in the house, but those snippets are often buried in the paragraphs that descibe the philosopy. A list in a sidebar would have perked this book up for me. As is, I read a lot to pull out the suggestions I found. It is otherwise a full introduction to the philosophy if this is what you are looking for."
2,Superficial & Without Flow---,I have owned this book for a while and never could really get the jist of what where she was going with it. The most interesting parts of book are about the Bank Of China where they follow strong Feng Shui principles and how she became successful in positing her office. This is wonderful if you can move your doors to face your most auspicious positions and havethe clout to tell you CEO you would like to recontruct your office at his(her) expense. I have tried from other sources to position myself in the workspace and will say that my bosses thought I was insane. I think book is poorly written with too much useless information.
2,Very Confusing,This book was very confusing. I have had to buy other books to understand the art of Feng Shui. Not interesting. I would not buy this book.
1,Very poor written Feng Fui Book,"I bought this book with intention of trying to reposition by house after moving to new house in Torrence, L.A. This book does not provide good tip and very confusing points that may not practical for me. A disappointed book."
2,Little or no practical solutions to get started,"The history on feng shui was present but this book was far from a complete illustrated guide. Complete being the operative word here. I found myself needing to order another book immediately so I could now find out how to apply even some basics to my home. Just when she would say you need to position something for good or bad chi she would drop off into thin air. Even the illustrations in the back of the book are minimal at best, actual application from reading this book is almost non-existent. I can't believe I actually paid good money for this. I see she has written too many books on the subject which is why I think this one might be vague, so you need to buy each one to get a little more information. This has only sent me to other authors. I really hope no greed was intended here. Now that's bad chi."
4,Helpful guide but not for the beginner,"I've read a number of books on FengShui, and found this book beautifully illustrated. It offered many details about the background and different types of feng shui methods, which while informative could be very confusing to a beginner. I agree with the other reviewers that although it was reader friendly, it offered few or too brief solutions and the possible need for another book. Perhaps her smaller books would be good companions to this one. Just-A-Note: At the same time I bought this, I also ordered CREATING SACRED SPACE with FENG SHUI, Learning the Art of Space Clearing by KAREN KINGSTON. After reading both books, I consider SACRED SPACE to be a must have, a book that should always be the first feng shui book anyone reads. It can change your life."
5,I DISCOVERED FENG SHUI WITH THIS MAGNIFICENT BOOK,I have just discovered feng shui through Lillian's excellentbook. She makes this subject come alive and she demonstrates herskillful umderstanding of what must be a highly complex practice. I shall be looking to buy her Gardens book next
3,More plot than we need!,"On the one hand, this book is very useful because the writer is a top expert on Austen. But while she gives a lot of information on Austen's culture, she spends too many pages givng long plot summaries. I recommend JANE AUSTEN FOR DUMMIES as a great alternative: the author of that gives a great sense of the culture, characters, and Austen, herself, in a witty, clear style."
4,Finding Jane...,"A longtime fan of Jane Austen's novels I really enjoyed this book as a supplemental for information about the culture, politics and era that the novels take place in. I learned a lot fo things about this time period and how it relates to the books. I thought it was a excellent source of information. I also really liked reading the authors interpretations of the books and her character sketches on what she thought some of the main characters would have looked it. This is a great edition for the library of any lover of Jane Austen's works."
5,"this is the best CD I have ever heard, in my entire life!!","Three words...Buy!, Buy!, Buy! This CD is the most diverse and melodik album i have ever heard in my life. It samples so many different flavors but they all flow together so perfectly. I am into house and techno, but im always open to a good remix of a genre... not only does Tom take his mixing to the next level but at the same time creates an ambience never heard before! This cd is perfect for someone who is avid about mixing, these smooth tracks really hold up against a pumping beat! There is something on this CD for everyone! From the classical funk, to rippin' guitar, and all the way to good ol' house! But This CD now its a perfect gift for anytime of the year!!!!!!"
2,Nifty similes but not very interesting,"Okay, so the purported author is a rambling old woman in her 70s, but that doesn't mean you will want to bear with this meandering narrative. There isn't much to pull you through--smashing idols with feet of clay? Yawn. Gore Vidal is so much more satisfyingly acidic. Concern for any of the characters? Not much. Fanny T. escapes what little peril she's in during one short chapter. White's descriptions of the characters who populate are marvelous but it's not worth the long sludgy haul to get to them. I'm fond of some of White's other work and thus am disappointed in this one."
1,Disappointing,"What you get is only 3 pieces: a Woody, and 2 pieces of fence. I didn't look closely enough at the picture of the cake -- the rest must be done in icing. I thought the price was very high for what I got. I paid over $20 by the time shipping was added in. The only reason I'm keeping it is because it's the only Woody topper I could find, and my son deserves it for his birthday cake."
2,Quality control? I don't think so.,So this is the second pachmayr grip I have purchased. The first one was 5 years ago. It was top of the line And very well made. Today I just got this one in the mail. Holy cow what a piece of crap! It wouldn't even fit on my revolver because all the excess rubber from the mold still around the edges. I spent 2 hours with a razor blade trying to cut away the excess rubber so my gun would fit. One spot in it was so thin that I cut a hole in the grip just by nicking it. After that I had to use 800 grit sand paper so the grip would come together proper not leaving any gaps. Other than that whole issue it would be an awesome grip. It fits comfortably and deadens the sound o the internal components when they operate. Hopefully this grip just got pass their quality control inspections and they still have good products out there.
4,hmm,There is a crack in back cover which was not stated in description. content is fine so i dont mind
2,REVIEW AND SPOILER,ok so it was fun and all but the thing that way bad about it was the fact that you spent more time OUT of your car then IN it. and when you were in it they slacked off majorly. graphics basically sucked and it was just an average game. and to make it worse the bad guy gets away!!
3,"Cheerful, useful, but a little *lite*","I would agree generally with the comments in the 5-star reviews but I would not give this book 5 stars. The author has good advice and some useful recipes but the book itself is very short- carefully double and triple spaced throughout- more material than a magazine article but much less content than the average 284 page book. The index and recipes are useful although limited. For example there are only 5 breakfast recipes, 7 lunch recipes, 15 dinner entree recipes. The plan does not address hurdles and challenges at all but assumes that the reader will 'just do it.' There is no advice on how to change habits and routines although new habits are outlined. So if emotional or social issues are part of your family's challenges, this book would not be helpful."
3,fish safe??,Does anyone have an idea if this is fish safe???? I know there was one negative review.....but not sure if the liner was the problem.
2,What size,"What size is it !.? Nothing states the size. Length , wide, weight ? How do I know if it will work for what I want with no sizes given."
5,Heavenly chair,"This chair was a birthday gift that I received about 8 years ago while in medical school. I suffered from back pain and spasms from working in the operating room and having poor posture. I love this chair! It's cute and stylish and goes well with the room decor. It's has many functions to choose from and reclines flat. It also has a manual function that you can alternate programs to target certain areas.Only down side is that it's a bit narrow, my roommate was a bit heavy on the derrier and could not fit in the chair.Overall though, awesome chair."
5,Buy this CD,"This is the best recorded performance of Chopin's Fourth Ballade, and believe me, I know what I'm talking about. It is in every way superior to his 1950's studio recording. It is dripping with emotion, but without distracting eccentricities (as heard, for example, in Moisevich's recording on the Great Pianists of the 20th Century series).Everything else on this CD is wonderfully played, and the Liszt Sonata is played with an intense (dare I say aggressive?) energy not commonly characteristic of Arrau.You will not be dissapointed by this disk."
5,Specific Techniques Learned,"Being a self taught learner of wood turning, I was getting frustrated with beginner books leaving gaps of specific information that I needed. The nitty-gritty detailed ""do it this way and not like that"" kind of info, and this book has now become the resource beside my lathe that I reference when I am not sure what/how to achieve results with the proper technique.Short of buying DVDs and placing a TV/DVD player in the shop, or traveling to another city to attend a class, I find that a good book in hand with illustration is more immediate and to the point rather than blogging and waitng for an answer."
3,Wrong Region,"Yes, this is an ALL region DVD which wont work on American DVD players. So, I just ordered an ALL region DVD player of Amazon for $85, which should show up early this week. However, this DVD does work in my computer so I watched it. It has 2 concerts on it, one of which I just realized I own on ""The Park is Mine"" VHS I bought a couple of years ago. This is still a good amount of PULP on one DVD featuring an important band in its prime. Worth getting, but like the PULP HITS DVD I doubt this will be released in a US format. I suggest getting an All region DVD player if you are into English music and movies."
4,"If it's ""Pulp"" can't be bad",This DVD contains 2 live concerts: T.H.I.S.F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.I.V.E. (1995) & The Park is Mine (1998) Performance is very good. One thing I didn't like in this release is the artwork. No book inside and very few information. It looks more like a dvd copy. The band is excellent in both shows and image and audio quality (also 5.1) is satisfactory.
2,Maddening.,"About the region problem, the best solution is to rip it and then remove the region code. There's various software out there that can do that. Then you can burn a copy that can be played on any DVD player. Note- I'm not advocating piracy. I did this with a DVD that I bought.But the biggest problem I have with the DVD is with The Feeling Called Live show. Compared to the original VHS (PAL) release, it's noticeably slower causing the pitch of the sound to be flat. Clearly they messed up the transfer from the original film to DVD. Fortunately, The Park is Mine doesn't suffer from this problem. I rate this 2 stars because of the pitch problem; if it didn't exist, I'd give it 5."
1,Amazon format mistake,"While I'm sure this DVD is amazing should you get it in a playable format, I'd suggest buying this from another vendor. Here the DVD is listed as region 1 (though it should be region 0); however, Amazon sent me regions 2-6, and are being inefficient about rectifying the situation. Maybe they've fixed the problem now, but I just want to prevent anyone else from dealing with such a mess."
5,A must read!,I have never been in the military but this book gave me a birds eyes view of what it must be like. There is plenty of humor to keep the reader interested as you follow Daljan from bootcamp through his naval career. This would be a great book for military people wanting a book that tells it like it is.
5,Humurous and Serious: absolutely amazing!,"David LaMotte -again- shows himself as an astonishingly gifted, and extremely funny (in songs like We Are Charlie's Angels) singer/songwriter! His anecdotes between songs make the double-live album simply AMAZING!This might be -along with Corners- the best David Lamotte album there is right now!"
4,backyardigans cups,They are awfully cute. I just wish they have a one way valve on them so the liquids don't spill as easily. But my son loves them anyway.
4,I have an autographed copy somewhere,I just realized that I have a copy of this cd which Ryan sold directly to me and autographed for me... I met him at his first show at World Cafe Live in Philadelphia in early 2005 before he did anything substantial or got big. I wonder how much it's worth?
2,Not my style....,Well I bought 2 CD's on Amazon.com and Eye of An Elephant was one of them. I have to tell you the truth... I don't like this one. Well... Ryan has a great voice but the way he sings is so annoying. Maybe It's just the style of the music. When I finished litsening to the CD I felt like I had litsened to the same song 20 times. But to say something possitive I love the piano. He's a great player.
4,Another for the collection,A nice looking figure! My only complaint is the battery's are not sealed and may explode in my unopened collection.
2,A bit disappointed after all the wait,"I was looking forward to the Mayne and Josie story because I already figured they will be paired together and I loved them in the last few books.I have to say I am very disappointed. Mayne was in love with another woman in most part of the book. He was not just ""in love"", but also lust after her. He didn't get Sylvie because she didn't love him, not because he loved her any less. I totally felt he had to settle for Josie because he couldn't get his great love. What a bad taste for a romance. Yes, in the end he loved Josie. But so what, it's only because he didn't have Sylvie.This kind of relationship we see in really life. Don't most of us fanticized about prince charming and had to settle and love our spouses. I didn't read romances to get a taste of this kind of ""romances"". I can see them everyday around me.I felt sorry for Josie. She deserved a much better story."
3,It took me a while,"I must admit that I didn't catch on to the titles until the third book. Unfortunately, it was easy to see this particular romance coming, but it was done with interesting twists and turns. I almost got fooled somewhere between the time I picked up and the the third chapter or so. If you are like me and have to finish every series you start, read it--you'll like it. If you can do without it, don't read it--you can do without it."
2,Disappointed,"This is the first book I read in this series. I bought it after reading these reviews. Griselda's story seemed much more interesting and I found myself skipping over Josie and Mayne. While I could see Josie falling for Mayne (older man, etc.), I could not see him falling for someone that he had known as a child (15 or so) and he was already in his 30s. I am giving it 2 stars only for Griselda's part of the story. Off to the used book store!"
2,Not as good as the other books,"it was around summer time that I found out about E. James writing and fell in love with it. Of course my ultimate favorite has to be Rafe and Imogen. Anyway, I waited for the last book to finally get published for about 5 months. When i finally read Pleasure for Pleasure, I was so dissapointed. I thought Darlington and G. were good but not Mayne and Josie. I thought the plot line for the two was too short and frankly too boring to really read through. I read the 1st half and became slowly disinterested with the rest. It just wasnt up to par with the other 3 Essex sisters and their stories."
2,okay but...,"I read Kiss Me Annabel and was not overly impressed but the character of Mayne was my favorite so I got Pleasure for Pleasure because it was his story with Josie Essex who I also enjoyed from the previous book. This book was okay but the character of Mayne been tampered down or something. In addition, there was hardly any interaction between him and Josie. You never saw him jealous of any of the suitors of Josie, you never saw them flirt or have tension between the two (although you did see it a bit more on her part). I am not sure but they were never together alone long enough for chemistry to build. Then they were forced into a marriage by a weird circumstance and so I thought it would build during that time, Nope. I enjoyed the read however but the characters seemed watered down and not even moments together for it to be in my favorite category."
2,Eloisa James can do better.,"I too was disappointed with this book, as I also was with the previous book regarding Imogen and Rafe. I feel that both of these sisters, especially Josie, who was hugely likeable in all of the previous stories, deserved their own romances outside of the ""friends of family"" circle. It feels a bit like a TV Soap Opera where the same people just keep changing partners and switching spouses, with very little new blood. I also thought both of these matches were forced and contrived out of very little foundation in the previous stories. It was disappointing given that I really loved the first two books, especially Kiss Me Annabel. I generally am a huge fan of series with different friends or siblings getting their own stories, but it need not be so forced, both Maitland and Josie deserved better."
4,Pleasure for Pleasure,"I do not agree with those who do not know how Mayne ends up loving Josie. He notices her figure, her lovely hair, etc., when escorting her to Scotland. He seems to think of her frequently. He absolutely appreciates how gorgeous and clever she is from the beginning. And the kiss he gives her to make her feel more womanly (the great ""losing the corset"" scene) leaves him a little breathless. His fiancee is completely uninterested in him except as someone who meets her criteria on a list. She is very cold. I believe Mayne loves the idea of her, but doesn't have a clue what she's like on the inside and would be miserable being married to her. I considered a long time before listening to this book because of some of the reviews (also Taming of the Duke which I found completely romantic), but was very happily surprised and satisfied."
3,didgeridoo & tibetan singing bowl,"I am interested in the sounds of the tibetan singing bowls, the didgeridoo element was not a sound I find refreshing."
1,not so much.,"I was really looking forward to this CD. Unfortunately, hte sound quality is really poor. I had my sterio turned all the way up and could still hardly hear it. Also, I was disapointed in the representation of the digeridoo, could hardly hear it but could have been the bad quality too."
1,Pearl/Diamond Disappointment,I was disappointed in this pendant. It is very small. I intended to give it to my adult daughter for Christmas but will be giving it to the teenager next door instead.
3,good price but beware it's very thin/small,"It is pretty inexpensive, and it came in as advertised - I guess, except it still suprised me how thin the chain was (my wife likes that actually) and how small the pearl was (which was a turn off)."
3,"Didn't work for me, might for you","I bought four of these to use in wall sconces operated from a dimmer switch. Unfortunately, the one I opened buzzed loudly and flickered wildly, no matter how the dimmer was adjusted. WattBuster's customer service was quick to authorize a return. They indicated that these bulbs don't work well with all dimmer switches."
1,Only one real brand of dimmable made-in-Chia CFLs,"These have been re-released as ""Harmony"" and as ""U Lighting America"" and they have their own ""UL"" logo to make it look like they're UL listed.It appears that there is only one actual type of dimmable 23W CFL from China, and they all have very high failure rates, 6000 hour ""warranty"".I couldn't get warranty on mine that failed the day they were installed. The seller also wouldn't take them back.So basically, avoid these bulbs. Go for the Sylvania, Earthmate or GE brands with good reviews."
2,Not great - one major flaw,"I have had this pump for a while, and the one feature that I cannot stand about it is that you can't plug it in once it has lost its charge and use it. You have to actually plug it in and wait until it charges, then use it. So if it dies (which they often do when sitting idle for more than a few days), you simply cannot fill your air mattress without waiting to it to recharge first (which takes hours and hours, by the way). It ends up meaning that I have to plan ahead and think to charge this a day before each use, which is a complete pain (and I never remember)."
4,A Great Book!!!!,"With all the bad reviews,You might think this book is not good!!!But it don't!!! I LOVE FEAR STREET books and this is one of the best!!!It's way better then most of them!!!!read this book!!!I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Ghostly girlfriend,"When Cory falls in love with Anna, he puts everything on hold. He skips practice and is losing sleep. Soon he learns the truth: Anna is dead. Now Cory must get to the bottom of the mystery that is Anna.A nice little story, although a bit similar to Stepsister and Blind date."
5,"really amazing,","I think, it is unique and impressive creation by R.L Stine.In this book he is expressing different kind of romance,so it is really good."
4,Great Reading for horror teen lovers!,This was great especially for a new girl who just moved to Shadyside and boy is very inlove with her .She is very mysterious who he has to find out who she is and has to go to Fear Street to find out and that is where the suspense and horror happen! The book is great for young adult interested in the subject that R.L Stine writes! This isnt the only novel that is the best! Read it!
2,How new is a psycho to this area?,The usual run of the mill juvenile fiction that Stine is just so good at creating. This is only memorable for being the first in the FEAR STREET series. And one of the more tamer in the series. The same plot as all the rest.
1,This Book Is A Big Disappointment For R.L. Stine,"I was very surprised by the context of this book. I think R.L. Stine should've done a WAY better job than what he did. Yes, I have to agree, it was romantic, but I thought R.L. Stine was supposed to write Young Adult Horror/Thriller novels, Fear Street anyway!"
2,"Ummm, I wasn't fond of this book.","I didn't really think that this was a great book, because it was very predictable. And how come there's ALWAYS a psycho?"
1,Junk,"Recieved this item in poor packaging (would you believe in a priority mail envelope?) I did not recieve the information I needed to make it work. My father worked 5 hours on this item, I chose Linksys because it sounded like adurable product.I tried to talk to the Amazon client but all he/she was concerned about was he/her rating and he/her would not answer any of my questions.It felt generic and then creepy and then it started to feel like harrassment. I reported them to Amazon and they stopped bothering me about the item.I ended up going to walmart and buying an expensive wireless modem at this point was through chasing cats. Works well."
5,execellent,"I will never buy a router without antenna's again. We live in a two story house and my router is on the second floor in my home office. This was the first router I ever purhased 7 years ago. When it quit working I could not find it in stores so I let several computer repair people talk me into a wireless router without an antenna. They told me they worked just as good. WRONG!! It had very weak if any signal on 1st floor. My brother had the same problem and he found the LINKSYS WRT54G on line, thank goodness. You must have antenna's to extend the signal throughout your house if on multiple floors, it must get thru walls, etc. Great router, I now have full signal wherever I go in our house, which is approx 3200 sq ft."
1,dont buy second hand router,"i brought a linksys router from amazon model wrt54g in sept07 , it cost me 46$ , i would like to tell u all to buy a buy a brand new one instead of buying a used one. My router didnt work at all an there was an inherent problem with it. I tried customer care and everything else , finally i had to return the product to amazon. A new one compatible with vista comes for 70$ and it is much better than buying this, and it will save u a lot of headache , also the new one is available at any tech sore like radioshack , etc"
1,Angelic Upstarts,"Classic live Angelic Upstarts at the end, but it's just not cutting the fabric for me."
2,nivea cream- photos deceiving,"nivea cream is a great product, however the ones that i purchased were so small it was like a travel size and it should have said it. i realize that the measurements were written, but for the price i thought i was getting the bigger version. i still kept it."
5,Great overview of various tarantulas!,I agree with the review of Tom Kavanaugh. I have uploaded some images of the cover and table of contents; which has a list of all the species covered. If you can't read the images go to my image gallery and you'll be able to see them there.
2,Wrong Size,I ordered this item and it was too small. Did not match the dimensions listed in the write up. It was very easy to send back and my account was credited right away.
4,Awesome Bag,This bag is great for a weekend trip. Probably a little too big for the gym unless you plan on changing at 3 times.
5,This book deserves a place on the shelves of Lincolniana.,"This revised edition of the Great Abraham Lincoln Hijack, story of the 1876 attempt to steal President Lincoln's body, first published in 1990, is footnoted with foreword by Thomas F. Schwartz, Illinois State Historian. Bonnie Speer has made a notable contribution to Lincoln literature and this study deserves a place on the shelves of Lincolniana. It is most readable and factual. Wayne C. Temple, Illinois State Archives"
5,Great drum CD,This is a nice CD by this master drummer but it helps to be a drummer to really enjoy it.
1,Same as the guy above,"Couldn't have said it better myself, so I'm just going to copy and paste it. Word for word _exactly_ what I've said about this horrible release of a great movie.""This is not a condemnation of the movie itself which is fantastic. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD is 16:9 and it is not, it's 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire screen or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player."""
5,Different but still good,"This movie (and its a movie, not a collection of episodes) is a little different than the first 2 stages, and the voice acting is different, but its still good and keeps the story going. all in all, a good purchase if you like the initial d series."
1,Blech!,"This is not a condemnation of the movie itself which is fantastic. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD is 16:9 and it is not, it's 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire screen or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player."
4,This machine rocks,The mfg forgot to include a manual so I emailed the company and within 2 minutes I got the manual via email. The machine performs like a champ and there great customer service made up for the missing paperwork.
4,"If you like the ""details"", buy this book","I have just recently come in contact with a classic AC Ace automobile. There are limited resources of information on the web and also in books, probably because there were so few of these cars produced. Rinsey Mills has put together a great book with all the historical details and a bunch of the mechanical details as well. It also has a ton of great pictures, new and old. If you own or are interested in an AC Ace or Cobra, you need this book."
4,flawless artistry ... shabby packaging,"You would be hard-pressed to fault any of the music on here. Kenny Burrell is a supremely talented guitar player, and these tunes are mellow little jewels. Burrell's tasteful guitar technique is a far cry from the funky strumming of Grant Green, but it's still a style I can marvel at, appreciate, and enjoy. What bugs me about these ""40th Anniversary"" CTI reissues is the blandless of the packaging; a paper sleeve with zero liner notes or anything else special. Okay, you get an ""alternate take"" of ""A Child is Born"" on this version, but that doesn't really justify the high price. If labels keep putting out cheap packages like these, they should price it accordingly; much lower."
2,Same problem,"After 13 months the bottom 1/3 of the screen began to dim everytime the TV is on for 40 minutes. Amazing since the warranty is 12 months. Haven't tried to fix it yet. just will deal with it, I don't feel like dishing out more money. Besides that the picture is great."
2,Minor Problems,I've enjoyed this item until a week ago and now I'm unable to get it to power up. I've checked web sites for salutions and I'm unable to get my unit to operate. can someone please help me with this problem. the manuel has not been to kind.
4,Pretty Damn Fine,"I'm a fan of The Greats as far as jazz goes -- Coltrane, Miles, Thelonious, Mingus, Hancock -- and almost everything made in the modern era doesn't grab my attention. It's usually lacking in one main thing that all the greats share: Soul. I've listened to quite a number of modern jazz bands, and this is the first one I've been motivated to write about. They've got style, originality, and, yep, soul. Reminiscent of Coltrane in his quintet days, it's a very, very sound and enjoyable album."
5,Great songs. In the tradition of the best folk singers.,"Even if you don't understand the words, you can understand Mr. Mey's songs. From a tradition dating back to the troubadours, he turns life into music with an incredibly creative innate sense of melody. Even without understanding the text, you can empathize with him as he lost his red bear, Or hear the hope in his voice as he sings: Du kannst Fliegen, Ja, du kannst."". If you do understand the text, then you are certainly in for a treat. Without malice or ""Schadenfreude"", he conveys a gentle social criticism, and a very friendly vision for the future."
4,Long time user,"This really helps my skin. My face has less wrinkles and age discoloration when I use this regularly. Glad I can get it sent to my door, can't get it at the drugstores."
4,Helps with acne...,"I normally use a 2% salicylic acid lotion for my acne. It doesn't completely solve my problem though so I've been looking for something stronger. This stuff is not exactly made for acne, but it is the same ingredient as my acne medicine except in a 3% concentration instead of 2%, so I thought I'd give it a try. One thing I like about it is that it has very few other ingredients (all of which are non-comedogenic), so I don't have to worry about the non-active ingredients causing me problems. It is slightly drying and has caused minor flaking, but nothing too major. I only use it at night though (and my regular 2% stuff during the day) because it doesn't work under make-up. It dries leaving an almost rubber-like coating on my skin, so when I try to apply make-up on top, the gel rubs off in a rubbery layer. It has made a minor improvement in my acne, but not as much as I'd hoped."
4,Perfect!,"This is the best product for treating my husbands dry skin condition on his face. It eliminates the redness and flaky patches after 2 or 3 nights. He does complain of a slight burning or stinging sensation, like alcohol on a cut and he has to use it consistently to keep his face clear. Too bad its not sold in drug stores."
3,"a little slippy-slidey, but okay","These fit, and work just fine, but they are a little slippy-slidey and move too much on the vacuum. Because of the fine grains I am cleaning up in my house, I needed multiple replacements (the fine grains are tearing the rubber up and making the belt snap before its time), and fortunately, these are enduring longer than the other belts I had. So, they are durable. You will just want to double-check the vacuum after each use and make sure it's on the roller and appropriate placement on the brush/head."
3,Belt,These belts fit well and worked well but I ended up breaking a belt when I ran my vacuum over my shoe laces. Seemed like they break pretty easily but it may be because of the vacuum
1,I did not expect to receive a product like this. Especially if purchased from Amazon.,They sent me a belt that is already at the end of its shelf life. It snapped and broke the second day my wife used the vacuum cleaner. I was'nt pleased with the product. I only got about an hour and a half of use on this product.
2,great fit didnt hold up,I am in afghanistan and work on heavy equipment.I bought these gloves because of the reviews and the fact that the mechanics gloves we were provided just dont hold up.Well the gloves lasted 3 days then the finger seam blew out just like the mechanics gloves do.The fit is great and feel like they are brok in as soon as you wear them.Wish i can find a pair that lives up to the hype.good thing they will be a tax write off.
1,peeling finish,"Same as the other reviews. We bought this in 2010, and in less than a year the finish is peeling off of one of the faucets."
1,finish peels!,"We bought the entire Danze Parma collection for our gutted bathroom in winter 2008. Three body sprays, hand held shower, two faucets etc.By summer 2009 the finish was peeling off of all but two fixtures. I took photo's and emailed them to Danze along with product numbers and place of purchase.They replaced all of the fixtures, but once again they are peeling!! I used ""scubbing bubbles"" on the first ones, which I thought was benign enough. On the replacements I used diluted white vinegar (per Danze instruction)and still they peel. I have taken more photo's but have not had the time to send them in, but will now. We are remodeling another bath and although we love the look of the fixtures, we won't use Danze again. They are warranted for life but who wants to constantly be changing the fixtures?! My husband wants to replace everything but that would involve ripping out the tile, so that's not happening."
2,Disappointing,"Had high hopes for this one, was looking for some specific advice on employers and fields outside academia who would hire Ph. D.'s. Found mainly warmed-over What Color Is Your Parachute ignore-the-job-market-realities pap, old-hat interview and resume stuff, and other ideas geared toward helping lifelong academics understand a few basic things about the business world (in which I spent almost 20 years). $35 later I still don't have even a good general picture of my nonacademic prospects after completing the Ph. D. next year, but see no better source out there. Guess that's what I get for choosing a five-year-old out of print book; afraid I see the reason why."
3,Should have listened...,to all of the middling reviews for this book. I was seriously disappointed when I received it in the mail. First I thought they would list different types of jobs available and how to market yourself for them instead I was treated to 10 pages of their backgrounds and then their interviews of others who left the academic world. The interviews were interesting but not what I thought I was buying.
4,VERY helpful!,"I hate that this book is out of print and so expensive! It helped me enormously to realize that there are other options out there than the ones we're usually told about! If you're considering leaving academia, or even staying in it, this book gives some other options and provides hope that there are other things to do in this world!"
4,Targeted towards grad students and other academics,"The real strength of this book is that it is addressed directly at graduate students and other academics. Most of the advice that is in this book can probably be found in other career books but here it is tailored to the needs (and anxieties) of graduate students who are looking for careers outside of academics. The authors provide many anecdotes of people (including themselves) who have sucessfully left academics as well as those who have chosen to remain or return to academic position. Further, they provide concrete advise for making the decision to stay in academics or leave and how to present that skills that have been gained in the graduate school experience to potential employers.As a graduate student who expects to receive his Ph.D. in the next 6 month, I enjoyed reading this book and found that it addressed many of the anxieties that I have concerning leaving academics."
2,broke after 2 weeks,"I purchased this tripod based on editorial reviews such as: http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/VEL/VEL.HTM, right before embarking on a 10 week x-country roadtrip.2 weeks into the trip, the clamp that allows extension in one of the legs broke, making it impossible to extend and lock the leg.It turns out the the inside pieces are cheap plastic!Please note that I was a bit rough with it (undoing the clamps and flipping upside down to let the legs collapse), but given that this was designed for outdoor, 'roughing it' expeditions, it should really not have broken so easily.I will say that the size and weight are fantastic.The inner components should definately be stronger!!!"
4,JUST THE RIGHT SIZE,"Velbon's MAXi 343E tripod is the perfect size for traveling. It easily fits into my carry on bag along with my camera gear. Although it is too light-weight to support heavier gear, it is ideal for my digital camera work. I also love the swivel head that does away with the old arm-mount design. I can set up in a snap. Just level and shoot. It has solved my need to ""travel light"" and recommend it to others with similar needs."
3,"Ok, but there is a better alternative - Bogen 724B Digi Tripod","I have had this Velbon tripod for a couple of years, but I rarely use it. Instead I use a Bogen/Manfrotto 724B Digi Tripod with ball head. The Bogen is 1 pound heavier. It is also 5"" taller at 64.6"" with the column raised. The Bogen is a much stiffer tripod with a much better ballhead on top. Both tripods claim to support cameras up to 7.5 pounds, but I find that more believable with the Bogen than the Velbon. I actually bought the Velbon first, and found the Bogen to be so much more of what I wanted, that I bought that second. I am keeping the Velbon for those occasions (e.g. backpacking) where that 1 pound makes a difference and I will only be using a light digicamera."
1,Occasional use and it broke! Don't waste your time or money!,"I agree with someone below who said, ""the clamp that allows extension in one of the legs broke, making it impossible to extend and lock the leg. It turns out the the inside pieces are cheap plastic!""I owned mine for less than a year, with maybe once a week use, and it busted the same way for me. Never again. I guess people buy Bogen for a reason, and that's the direction I'm going.The 343 does come with a lifetime warranty, so I'm enforcing the warranty coverage and will sell it on eBay once its returned to me from service."
3,Desperately looking for audio cassettes.,"The book itself is good, but it is imcompleted without the audio cassettes to listen to the correct pronunciation."
2,"Not two PAIRS in the ""Pack of 2""","I just got off a very frustrating call with Amazon Customer Service. I was surprised when I received these that there was only one pair of insoles in my order, despite the very prominent ""Pack of 2"" on the product page. After a lot of back and forth I was informed that ""Pack of 2"" refers to the fact that there are two insoles in the package, not two PAIRS. When I asked why all insole (or shoe, for that matter) listings don't state ""Pack of 2"" in their description the reply was ""I don't know."". As far as the insoles go, they are fine, but definitely not worth $13 for a single pair. I'd go with the Pedtag washable ones instead."
2,Not great quality,"The product is a very thin sheet of(maybe 1/8')foam with terry on one side. It comes with a cardboard guide with the cutouts of the different shoe sizes on it, you cut out the size you want and trace it onto the foam and cut it to fit your shoe. The foam is so thin however, that it shifts and bunches in your shoe throughout normal wear. Also the terry was not very absorbent which is why I bought the insolen in the first place. Would not recommend."
3,Misleading ad but good product,I have purchased these before from a shoe catalog and cant get thru the summer without them. Very good product and usually cost more elsewhere. Only problem is this misleading ad and I think that is way the reviews are lower. There is only ONE PAIR in the package - so not the big bargin you think you are getting. Yet the price is fair for one pair. I like these better then another brand sold thru amazon. These can be cut to size and dont make your feet sweat as much.
1,Only came with a single insole not two...,How in the world should one use a single insole? Even though it says pack of two (which I assumed meant at the very least an insole for each foot but the best two pairs) it came with one single insole. I guess if you don't mind getting stuff with no quality control that you can't use then this would be a good purchase.
4,"If lyric is important for you, you'll love this!","This is a wonderful album. The first half of it reminds me of John Denver... I suspect Reinhard Mey was influenced by American country music. Then the latter half of the album reminds me of Yves Duteil: thoughtful, well-written lyric with orthodoxically nice music... If words are important to you, or if you like John Denver or Yves Duteil, (or Die Prinzen, actually) you'll love this!"
3,overall it's nice if you fond of tamboura,"The CD consist of 4 tracks, 1 and 2 tracks voiced by David Wagner and other tracks have just music. I guess I've expected flute to be in both tracks 3 and 4 but unfortunately for me track 3 has flute and track 4 has tamboura, the length 30 min. I would appreciate the track 3 with flute to be longer then 10 minutes but I guess I should've paid closer attention to the description before buying because after a while sound of tamboura gets a bit ennoying instead of relaxing (for me) and I'd rather enjoy flute for as long as the whole CD. I found that the voice of a woman would have been probably more relaxing for me then the voice of a man, in this case David Wagner, may be it's just me and someone will find his voice quite relaxing. But I know for sure I woudn't be buying CDs with the sound of tamboura as much, now focusing on flute :)Overall CD is great for background music or meditating."
3,Outdated but occasionally still insightful,"David Foster Wallace and Mark Costello are too cute by half in this book, and it is horribly out of date. (Just to give an idea, A Tribe Called Quest, who were considered an elder statesman group when they broke up two years ago, had not yet released an album when this book was published.) But most of the analysis of rap's place within popular culture remains somehow applicable to the current scene if you are willing to do a bunch of critical work along the same lines and ignore the dumber flights of fancy. Still a fun book to read and a fun book to debate. Not to be missed if you remember when LL Cool J was good and you have read anything by a master of postmodern philosophy."
2,a bit outdated...but then again IS old...,"i am actually doing a report on rap and selected this book expecting some insight...i was surprised. it seems like some of this was even just put here to take up space; i was dissapointed, expecting something better from costello. a point of view not needed in most situations. of course, ten years ago it might have been close to adequate--now it seems totally inadequate to use in my report."
4,"practical, insightful primer on team dynamics","As a former HR Director for a Fortune 200 firm, I found Dr. Zoglio's work practical, insightful and extremely helpful for OD specialists as well as line mgrs seeking to optimize productivity and contribution from the many teams they are entrusted w/ in todays work environment. The processes and guidelines offered in this piece reflect an in-depth understanding of and experience with the complex dynamics of matrixed team environments so prevalent in todays business environment. I recommend it highly !"
1,"""Where's the beef?"" Too simplistic.","I suppose if you don't know anything about teams this could be useful introductory reading. The book provides very general ideas neatly formated into 7-keys, all cutely starting with the letter ""C"". Each time I got to an area that might provide some guidance on ""how to"" for a topic, however the author left a little icon in the margin advertising her other Training Program. It felt like this book was a marketing tool for her other book."
4,"It's all here in this one book, no pictures though","All campsites of New England with all the possible information you want!!! I especially like the 'Scenic' rating wich tells you where to go to camp on places with beutiful views!!!Very nice and comrehensive guide, too bad that there are no pictures...(rather impossible, it wouldn't fit in one book)"
3,grand funks weakest,"Grand funk put out so many great discs , even their later ones where good, this is really more of a two and a half star release , than a 3 but such is life. I would say that I enjoy every gf release much more than this one, including the two preceeding this one. Those were good + , but this one was a band that was falling apart completely and not very inspired here. Their last two from the 80's are better than this thankfully. This band was so great that when a great band lands something so average it probably makes some fans want to give it a one star. But this is average rock and not terrible, it's just good - and that is it. ""born to die' and 'all the girls in the world beware' were much better and even those two are not as great as what came before but at least they were not at this point, the point of hanging it up for years."
1,GFR LIGHT,"Like the other reviewer stated, this might be worse than 'All the Girls....' LP. If you are new to this band, first get the original live LP Grank Funk Live...pure high energy hard rock...Punk, garage and metal all rolled into one. Then get The 'Red Album' and thier first ""On Time'. Those are the studio versions that make up most of the live LP mentioned above. 'Closer to Home' is their finest studio moment. After that, well they start losing their focus. 'E Pluribus Funk is OK and has a classic...'Lonelness' & 'Foot Stompin' Music'. Survial is musically different, but still interesting and has a couple of covers that are cool. After that, well it gets pretty thin. Phoenix & Shinin' On are marginally ok, Mark Don & Mel is a great comp package, then they really hit the top 40 suck path with We're an American Band. The Lp is ok, but it is so comerical and top 40 that looking back at their hard rock days, it got pretty depressing for old GFR fans. After that they should have called it off."
1,oh come on!!!!!!,"I thought that ""All the girls"" was the worst GFR cd untill I heard this. It is soooo bad, come on guys, it sucks. Frank Zappa should be turning in his grave over this one. Take away everything that made GFR different, add some sub par FZ smoozy songwriting, smother in cheese and sit back to audience apathy. Yup, this really must have killed GFR stone dead, if you like this nothing can save you."
5,Amazing Swan Song,"How is it that a band is on the way out and yet creates its best record before folding up its tent??? I can't explain it, but this disc is easily the best of GFR MK2. I consider the GFR MK 1 to be the power trio years up to the E Pluribus Funk record. They then become more of a pop band and achieve hitmaker status. The pairing of them with Frank Zappa was inspired. The songs are stellar, the playing tight and focused. If you are a fan of either the trio years or the AM radio ones, pick this up and give yourself a treat!!!"
3,Not so good!,"This album doesn't come close to comparing to Grand Funk in their prime. The lyrics are shallow, meaningless love songs. The singing has no force and the instrumentation is uninspired. Grand Funk was defunct when they released this album. They had lost their mojo."
2,"Grand Funk Sings, Dogs Bark","This album was clearly the motivation for the last minute of Guns & Roses ""November Rain"".Frank Zappa appears on this release playing a guitar solo, a reviewer here claimed it was Zappa's best, perhaps they missed the other 74 CDs Zappa released with guitar that was far superior to the solo here.Not even Zappa could save this album of howling and screams that made my dog bark in pain... there's a reason the band dissolved after this debacle and it's made clear when you listen why that happened."
2,Poor Graphics,This is a 10 year throwback in graphics quality. Suitable for a 10 year old computer but not today's modern computers. Game is OK if you want to practice Blackjack but ancient in its graphic display.
5,Donte Stallworth Philadelphia Eagles Black NFL Replica Jersey,"Great jersey, fast shipper, I am very happy with the purchase. Thank you very much."
4,Great book,"I just stumbled across my copy of The Pocket Guide to Military Aircraft. I purchased my copy Feb 1987 for $7.50 while stationed in England. I now have a pretty nice collection of aviation related books, but this one stands out as one of my favorites. Best $7.50 I think I ever spent. This book was first printed in 1986. I carried this book with me during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and one more deployment in 1994. After that,the info started to become dated, and the book was no longer current, but, it's still a fun to read."
1,Less Than 1 Star,"I'm not sure what standards or criteria the prior reviewers used for their critique, but this book was just dreadful. I didn't find anything redeeming about it, and hope that others will spend their money more wisely than my mother did."
4,A Groundbreaking Book,"David Hatcher Childress's book looks at the Lemuria story, the lost continent of the Pacific or maybe Indian ocean, with great imagination and intellectual curiosity. For the first time since the 1930s he approached the subject in detail, and he is not afraid to take on many aspects of the story, however quirky, with an open mind. Moreover, I liked the physical descriptions of the places he visited, and the book can be read as an offbeat travelogue as well as alternative archaeology. Recommended reading for lost continent buffs!"
5,Sparked a fire in my mind,"An excellent book by this fine author. Pennick offers fascinating depth on runic history, the meanings and uses of the runes and on runic magick. Scholarly but written in a tone that manages to refrain from dryness. The differences between the various runerows could possibly have been edited down a bit, but I'd rather have too much info than too little. I even found a runescript - from something carved into a bluff in Oklahoma about 700 years ago, that ignited a flash of inspiration and a magickal rune poem. I enjoyed the in-depth look at the newer runes of the Younger Futhark, and the sections on tree magick; and the section on Runic workings is lighting the flame of inspiration in my brain."
5,Profound,"One of the best books on Hinduism I have ever read. The book is about the conversations between a teenager, Nichiketa, and Yama - the God of Death : how Yama tempts the teenager with all the wordly riches just to test his sincerity and after being satisfied, unfolds the mystery of life and death to him."
5,Enlightening,"I just finished this book, and I have learned to appreciate life more, not get mad as easily, be more compassionate and reasonable. I would suggest it to anyone, with any religious beliefs. It definitely helped me get more out of life..."
5,Jonesing for more,"This is so sexy without the sex and it's tantalizing and sweet without being sappy and it's incredibly well done and thought out and sensual. The magic is great, the good/bad guy fights aren't typical and there are character analysis of each character and the reader understands the motivations for them doing what they do and the choices they make. It's so beautifully done and so engrossing and captivating. A serious must read. Even watch the anime. It's just as good. There really isn't sex, it's more like teasing but that doesn't diminish the story. It's just full on amazing. It holds its own without the sex but like I said, in a way is sensual, and romantic without being nauseating and loving."
4,AN EXTREMELY FUNNY COLLETION...,"Gary Larson's off-sided humour is definatley one of a kind. If you only laugh once, it's worth it!! (But, I feel you'll find a lot more than one funny!) TRUST ME!!!"
5,Far side book,"Who needs a reason! Mind, a postman suddenly put their head in the frame and took the longest time ever."
4,Great funny fanatic is Gary Larson,Gary Larson is the funniest drawer I have ever seen. I got the desk 2001 calendar and got hooked on the comics right away. I now own Far side galleries 4 & 5. I am looking forward to buying more books. Buy this book if you enjoy insane yet funny sophisticated comics. Jake S.
1,MOST TOXIC INK I EVER ENCOUNTERED IN PRINTED MATERIAL,"About one minute of exposure to the inside print ink (could be paper too, but was probably the ink) gave me a migraine within a couple of minutes, that lasted more than a 24-hour day.I am severely chemically sensitive to multiple varieties of chemicals (mostly man-made synthetics), but was never exposed to ink this toxic, not in newsprint, laser copy, or anything printed.It is printed in China, but so are a lot of innocuous books I've read. i.e. Maybe I just got a batch wreaking of shipping container fumigant or some other contaminant in unsealed boxes. - who knows? Like everything else, there is good Chinese and bad Chinese products, but who knows what's in the bad stuff. The country is teaming with toxic waste.Plant-based ink doesn't bother me, but even petro-based ink never gave me a migraine this severe, lasting this long."
4,"fun book, great gift",Purchased this book for my brother as he and his wife were preparing for their first child. Humorous book with truthful undertones. I made a daddy diaper belt for him as illustrated on the front cover and stuck the book inside one of the tool belt pouches. It made for a great gift.
5,Great Idea for new Dad,I needed a special gift for a new dad. This was a great idea. Highly recommend. Funny and lots of laughs.
2,misleading,The add shows a kit but when they send it to you all you get is the book. The book is great but when I bought it I expected to get the whole kit.
1,No toy equals one star,"I first purchased this book over a year ago ... and before I know it all of Tulsa is talking about how much I like babies. I deeply resent the invasion of my privacy. It is well known that I do not care for babies or ""Daddy books"" and only purchased my copy as an insulting gag gift for a friend of mine who has since decided against adoption. What's worse, unlike ""Baby"" Fulghum's other books, this one did not even come with one of those free toys. Total rip."
2,If you are a Deaf parent do not buy this DVD not closed caption,I bought this dvd for my son however the dvd that i recieved was not closed caption despite the fact it was clearly label as closed captions.very disappointment in Viacom and Nickelodeon and the closed caption provider for not doing the job rightyo gabba gabba is one of my son's favorite brand.
3,My kids are happy!!!,My kids really loved this it was very much entertaining them...and even me too enjoyed a lot!!!
1,No DVD!! The case was shrink wrapped and opened for a christmas gift with no dvd inside!,No DVD!! The case was shrink wrapped and opened for a christmas gift with no dvd inside! Very disappointed 3 year old.
1,Terrible Rash,"I was using the product twice a day for 5 days, and on the 5th day had bad itching on both my thighs where I had been applying the gel. On both legs I had gotten huge bumps like large bug bites. They appeared in clusters, one leg had about 10 bumps and the other 4. I usually do not react this way to new products. This is just my experience to it and my skins reaction, but I had never seen anything like it! I stopped using product and they are slowly going away."
2,Doesn't really work.....,"I am on my second tube of the gel, and this is my 4th week of use. I use it twice a day on most days, sometimes just once a day. It has made my skin very very soft....like silk...but the appearance of reduced cellulite is very minimal. I can hardly see a difference, if any."
1,It didn't work for me :(,I used two bottles of Nivea over a two month period. I can't see any improvement at all. I was really hoping it would help. It smells good though!
1,Crappy Product. Does NOT Work!,"This product is junk just like all the other cellulite creams on the market. It does NOT work. Save your money. I am slim and have minimal cellulite. I exercise and eat right and the product did not make one once of difference in my cellulite. The patches are a joke too and you only get a few in a box and they are supposed to be used regularly with the gel over several weeks. You'd be out of alot of money fooling with this. There is no cure for cellulite. If there were, all of the rich and famous people who have money for expensive cosmetic treatments would not have it!"
2,Completely useless!,"I purchased this three weeks ago and began using it as instructed. I chose the 2 times per day route. I find myself looking no different as well as having zits on my backside and my legs. I know that the gel is causing them because they show up within 30 minutes of application. I've gone a few days without using it, and when I start up again, I get more zits (after having them go away when I stop using the product). I rarely ever get zits on my backside. I'm pretty sure this crap is actually clogging my pores instead of doing me any good. Waste of time and money."
1,Does nothing at all,"Thank God I only paid 10 bucks for this cream. I don't have a lot of cellulite so I thought for sure I would see the results. Besides, I work out every day.Well, I have to say I saw nothing. I believe it's a psychological thing - you'll only see something if you WANT to see something."
1,doesn't work,"bunch of crap,such a complete waste of money.I bought a few bottles of this stuff,what a joke,just exercise the damn cellulite away,lol."
3,"not fabulous, but better than nothing","This cream is nothing special. But I use it as a regular skin firming cream, because it is better than nothing. However, there are many other ways to reduce cellulite that work better. I would recommend to start eating right, moving more, and doing massages and scrubs, if you really want to reduce your dimples. There is a course of cellulite reduction program at http[...], this really helps a lot."
1,The powerful scent had me giving up before I could give it a chance to work.,"I ordered this product based on the glowing reviews that I saw on Amazon as well as a few other sites. Excited to have some help for bikini season, I tried it before bed on the day that it arrived. I didn't use a lot either since it was the first time using it. This stuff has a very powerful floral scent. I'm allergic to scents like lavender and lilac. The scent gave me a headache within a few minutes and my boyfriend asked what the awful smell was even though I was on the other side of the room. I wasn't about to tell him that I was trying out new cellulite cream, so I just told him I was trying new lotion out and I vowed to never use it again. Usually, I'll stick with a product with a bad smell if it works, but the smell of the lotion was too much for me to try it again."
3,Buy this book if you don't want to cure meat naturally,"Buy this book if you don't want to cure meat naturally. It defends the use of nitrates and other chemicals, but it doesn't really explore any options or justify why they are needed."
4,Sausage Making Book,I am new to making sausage and wanted some kind of instructions. The book needs more reciepes. This is a good book for explaining all types Sausage making and meat drying
5,An excellent handbook for beginner or experienced home cook.,"Mr. Kutas' style and knowledge is clearly based on his own experience, and he shares all of this freely to the reader. He explains all the steps in this process in down-to-earth language which is easily understood by novices, while experienced home sausage makers can learn new tips. He takes the fear out of trying something new. The questioning reader can relate his instructions to his reasoning as to why he takes a particular step in the process. He practices what he preaches. An added bonus is the inclusion of tons of GOOD recipes (we've tried many of them with success)."
5,"Great Sausage Recipes & Meat Curing, 4th Ed.","This is a very informative book, both for novices and experienced sausage makers. Instructions are clear - very easy to understand. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject."
5,Great Sausage Recipes Book,This book is rich in information and the recipes I have tried so far are excellent in the end product and easy to follow.
4,Go to book for sausage beginners,"Do you want to have sausage that cooks without a cup of grease? Few additives? Wonderful taste? Then make your own sausage! It isn't hard: I make 5# at a time using my Kitchen-Aide pro mixer, a Krups spice grinder & stuff casings with a Gander Mountain stuffer. (I hope to get an electric meat grinder/stuffer in the future.). Obviously sausage can be mixed by hand in tubs at 10# batches & you can buy ground spices or use a mortar, but it is more effort! Shall I also mention I buy the meats on sale & the sausage ends up costing 1/3 of the store price with much better taste? Or that when I give sausage away I get rave reviews?Mr. Kutas has written a definitive book on sausage making, desirable ingredients, equipment, curing/drying, and also has some pretty darned good recipes. I wish the book used a spiral binder so it would lay flat, but I'm adding recipes to my iPad Paprika cookbook."
3,Good info,"This book is a very good source for info on sausage making however, there are many required ingredients that are not available locally with no information for substitutes which the rookie hobby sausage maker would not know about."
5,Sausage Maker,This book was given to my son-in-law. He has become a great cook and was very interested in making his own sausage. I have not tasted the sausage yet but I know that it will be great. Another great gift bought on Amazon.
3,"Very good explanation as how to make sausage. The recipes, not so good.","For me, this book really does a great job of explaining HOW TO make sausage (the process) very well for someone new or unfamiliar who wants to try sausage making at home. I can tell you making your own homemade sausage most definitely pay dividends in flavor as well as freshness, control of ingredients (fat content, artificial or non-essential fillers, binders, preservatives, etc.) BUT, you must have good sausage making recipes to do this successfully. Unfortunately, this is where the book falls flat. The sausage making recipes are bland and in many cases, chocked full of unnecessary fillers which I most certainly do not want. I am not regretful of owning this book but rather, I use this to gain a deeper understanding of the sausage making process combined along with other books, so I can make a better end product for home consumption."
4,Good Beginner Book,After reading other reviews I picked this book as a gift for a beginner and it looks like a good pick. Plenty of instruction and recipes.
4,The book is Good,The book is very convenient and good information. It is a good guide for people insterest in make sausages at home and industrial too.
3,Odd color for an aquarium bulb,"I purchased this bulb two weeks ago to replace a bulb in my aquarium. I expected the light to be more of a yellow, sunlight color than my existing purplish bulbs, but I was disappointed with the color. The light from the bulb is a light orange color which doesn't look like sunlight to me. It makes my aquarium look dirty. While the bulb works just fine, next time I'll go with a different color temperature."
5,The Rap,I have been listening to this tape of Millies for years and I still reckon she is one of the best sole singers I have ever heard. She sings from her heart.
2,Two Great Albums on One CD [2 & 1/2 stars for re-issue],"This could have been a great re-issue if some additional songs were included: b-sides, single versions, remixes, live recordings, etc (maybe a bonus CD or DVD). Still, this is a nice album to have, despite how much it overlaps with Millie's ""Totally Unrestricted!"" anthology. It is a concept album: it plays like a musical; each song is about the same relationship(s) and mixes into the next track. Millie sings from the perspectives of both the wife and the mistress (or the girlfriend and the ""other woman"" that he married, depending on one's point-of-view). ""Making the Best of a Bad Situation"", ""Tell Her It's Over"", and ""I Still Love You (You Still Love Me)"" are must-haves for Millie fans."
5,TELL IT LiKE IT IS,Millie Jackson has never Fronted.Her Music has been some of the Most Honest Ever Recorded.Her Voice&Music Here are Very Essential.She is Very Underrated but is a Great Musical Force.when you hear Millie Jackson You Know You are Hearing the Truth.
5,Fantastic album,"Millie Jackson's album Caught Up is simply the best. I had this album on vinyl years ago, when I was a youngster and I was over the moon to find it on CD. She has such a soulful voice and the story she tells about having an affair with a married man is gripping."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality by manufacturer!! I could have made a better costume. Cheap badges, cuffs, etc for the price"
3,This book is for the novice,"This is a good book for the complete novice, but by the time I got the book in the mail I was already up-and-selling on E-bay. I think people can figure E-bay out without the use of any book."
2,"If You've Sold On Ebay, This Isn't For You!","I was truly dissapointed in this book. As an Ebay seller with a feedback of over 400, I wanted to find a book that would help me increase my sales and give me some great ideas and resources.Not only was there no new information in there, it was information that anyone who did any research on their would have already found using the internet and Ebay itself.Out of all the reviews of all the books about Auctions out there, this one looked like the best for people who were already using Ebay. It's not.If you're 100% new to Ebay and you don't have time to do a lot of research on your own, it's a great reference. Otherwise, I'd suggest putting the money this book costs into your piggy bank."
5,Exceptional Book!,"This is a very well-written book, with a wealth of how-to-do it information. I was especially interested in Dennis's sniping techniques. His internet and server access methods are very similar to those used by experienced stock market day traders. I also enjoyed the entire tone of the book...it was fun to read, even if you never work up the courage to bid."
3,Not What I Expected,"I have always loved The Gimme Gimmes and I was pleased with all of their releases. Have A Ball was good, Are A Drag was great, and Blow In The Wind was awesome.They seem to have tackled on some R&B; songs from all decades. The only problem is that these songs are hard to recognize and arent even that entertaining in their original form.This is just an ok CD. For first time listeners I recommend Blow In The Wind."
5,Fantastic fun!,"I can't believe how well R&B; songs translate into punk. None of these melodies seem clumsy or out of place, it all works very well. The disc is hilarious too, I love the ""IknowIknowIknowIknowIknow"" part of ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" and playing the intro to the Sex Pistol's ""Pretty Vacant"" on ""Save The Best For Last"" was pretty cool too.As a whole, this album is just good fun. They take a very boring genre of music, and they rock its face off! I swear, if the original R&B; songs didn't sound waaaaay tooooo sloooooowww before, they will after hearing this album. Highly recommended for people who don't take their music too seriously."
3,"Good covers, but they all sound alike...","Me First and the Gimme Gimmes hit the scene and it was new and fresh to do ""punk"" covers of non-punk songs. But after going through about 40 songs, I think they have hit a dead end. All of the songs sound pretty much the same, even though the choices are pretty cool. (Sinead O'Connor's 'Nothing Compares 2 U' is an awesome cover!)It's a good effort, it just doesn't quite stack up against their other albums."
2,thpppp,"Me First could have done so much more with these songs. Overall I was disappointed and think the arrangements were pretty thoughtless. There is a novelty to the previous records, but this was was sort of [weak]. So many different songs yet the same monotonous sound."
3,"Okay, but kind of disappointing","After 3 great Cd's and a bunch of 7""'s I was really looking forward to this CD. On this CD, the guys did nothing new with the material. On previous records they added their own spin to the songs.... on this one, the songs sound like the originals except they are faster and the guys don't put their own spin on the music."
2,Probably my least favorite.,"I love Me first & the Gimme Gimmes, but this album hardly does it for me. Not sure if the fact I'm not at all into R&B; music, but I find myself skipping through a lot of the songs.The music sound kind of sloppy and a little slow compared to Blowing in the wind. Their are some good songs, so it's not a total lost. Just not my favorite.Worth buying but I would get Love their country, or blowing in the wind first."
1,Does not work seamlessly with ACT,"I purchased this scanner because ACT recommended it . It works , but takes an extra effort ( and extra keystrokes) to get the data off the business cards and into the ACT database. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!"
3,pretty good,"the bunion reviler was a little uncomfortable at first, but it really helped with some of tighter shoes. after a few hours though it became uncomfortable again, but that could just be my foot still getting used to it. i like it because its really small and easy to use, unlike things like yoga toes that are big and bulky and you cant walk in."
2,Just not right,My only complaint is that the bottom edge of these rubs the skin and makes it very uncomfortable. It just does not have the correct shape to sit between the toes and also be functional. I tried to just walk in my tennis shoes with it one and no way that it was going to work.
2,Seperates toes but doesn't prevent bunions from forming,"Chose instead of the gel ones which were too small and soft to do anything. These separated my toes, but not by much( my tiptoes (big ones) are barely apart). I didn't mind that they were less comfortable than the gels because they did something. I noticed they didn't stop bunions from increasing over time. And I wonder if the spacing pushes my big toe outwards, or lets my big toes push harder on the rest."
2,Didn't work for me.,"Too big and awkward; felt uncomfortable. I later discovered the gel type toe separators, and they are perfect. I agree with most of the critical reviewers; I regret not paying more attention before making my purchase."
2,Bunion Relievers,I did not like this product. It's very soft and did not help my toes. Not sure I would recommend because it is so soft.
2,stiff and uncomfortable,"These are made out of a fairly hard material that hurts my toes and feet when worn. I am wearing them for short periods at a time in the hope they will soften up over time. Then they will be very effective. -- Update a month later shows that this didn't work, because the stiff edges still cut into my toes. Maybe I should put them in the dishwasher for a month, and see if that softens them up. I will probably have to discard them, and change my rating to one star."
1,NOT WORTH BUYING,RUB AGAINST SKIN. NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL TRIMMED UP STILL SAME PROBLEM . NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WASTE OF MONEY
3,wide spacing for bunions,"I've tried a lot of toe separators. These are the biggest, and stay in place reasonably well. It's hard to wear them all day but are fine for say, 3-6 hours. They are easy to clean.I much prefer the foam separators Amazon sells. They are also easy to clean with a liquid soap and they dry overnight. Consider doubling up on the foam ones if you need the wide spacing.All that said, I haven't noticed any great improvement in bunion pain after a long walk or hiking. I have resorted to buying extra-wide shoes at a local ""Wide Shoes Only"" store and had them custom stretched with bumps where my bunions meet the shoes."
4,Smaller than expected,"These toe spacers were smaller than I expected, but they are still slightly wider than those viscose gel ones. Occasionally, I get some friction from the plastic edges, but it's not too much of a problem."
2,Buy the gummy rubber ones instead,"These are hard, stiff and uncomfortable. The same type that are clear and softer are much more comfortable. Look for the other type."
2,Not As Many as it seems,"I was a bit disappointed with this volume. Probably should have paid more attention to the description. I assumed that there would be an exploded view of each gun I own-and wanted to buy. This would then serve as ""do all"" reference for componentry. Not quite--lot's of drawings but not some of the more common Taurus revolvers among others. Some of the drawings are also a bit difficult to see/read numbers part shapes etc..Not a bad investment-just not a great investment. Excellent paperweight!!"
4,Book was good for the guns that were in it.,After being out the aerospace machine shop for a number of years and have begun to get into the GunSmith field and found the drawings for the firearms listed in the book helpful so far. They seem useful enough for me to tinker with some of my personal firearms until I obtain my FFL. I guess you really can't have a reference library that is going to be small.Lee
3,So - So,It was ok but nothing to get excited about. It didn't hold my interest as much as I would have liked.
2,read before,its ok but i know i have read stories like this before even in oliver hardy movies. and in kiddie mystery
5,Penny Nichols and the Mystery of the Lost Key,This for me was a fast read. There was never a dull moment. I recommend those who like mysteries will enjoy this one.
1,Simplistic Waste of Time,"This book was preachy, simplistic, boring and not helpful. It was neither motivational nor informative but it was a waste of money and my time."
1,This record is bollocks!,"This is NOT ""The Specials"" that we all know and love.It sounds like a bad cover band.I feel like a bloody idiot for having spent the money on this record. Very disappointing purchase, do yourself a favour, don't bother!"
5,"Why, oh why?","Why, oh why do I always buy CD's that are allmost unknown, but are so incredible good? This Cd really blew my mind! What kind of music? Hard to tell. Sometimes it's Blugrass. sometimes folk. but all of the time a kind of tight, tight sound, unlike I've ever heard before. The only bad thing with this Cd, is that it shames most of my other ones! I know their version of ""Oh death"" has to be the definite one! Too bad I can't lay my hands on the other Cd's they've made!"
1,Not worth the money,"I had high expectations for anything with the Garmin name on it, but I was disappointed.- The suction device is very poor and falls off the windshield after a few miles.- The holder takes two hands to operate and is very awkward to use. Makes taking the blackberry out of the holder or putting it in a real struggle.- I did not buy the charger cable, because I assumed it would a standard USB-type cable - it does not.- The Bluetooth device has no (or very poor) echo cancelling, so the person on the other end of your call hears their own voice transmitted back to them at a slight delay, making conversations nearly impossible. The work-around is to turn the volume way down - but then you can't hear well.- All in all I think this was a very poor purchase decision."
4,all tracks,"I had the opportunity once whilst in Ingolstadt, Germany (basically an insignificant town, when compared to its neighbour, Munchen)to listen to Bill Bourne live at a small joint, known as the Neue Welt. The least I can say I was subjugated by the bluesy gut feeling performance which was to say the least enthralling. Watching him playing harmonica, guitar and tapping the beat, it was pure magic. I am still enjoying every time the album which I bought then & there. I would not miss any live performance whenever I come across in Europe or else."
1,tri-continental,"This album was a surprise gift from a friend and I've become entraced by their sound ever since. MBO, the House, and Scarecrow Murders exemplify the sweet harmonies and smooth blending of musical styles that is the Tri-Continental sound.If you like the mellow sounds of Ry Cooder, Taj Mahal and the like then this melifluous album will delight you as it has me."
3,Interesting for perspective,"This is a good book to read if you are interested in the history of Bob Jones University. It gives a lot of good information about the University. However, if youare critical of BJU this book will drive you crazy. At times it reads as a 428 page brochure for BJU. One interesting thing about the school is that people tend to either love it or hate it. Melton Wright, loves it. In his mind BJU can do almost no wrong. But, this book gives a lot of good information from an insider and it deffinately gives the reader a feel of the feirce loyalty that BJU has from its supporters.If you are looking foor a more balanced history, also from an insider, read Standing Without Apology by Daniel Turner, or for an outsider view, which focuses on the seperatist movement, read An Island in the Lake of Fire byMark Taylor Dalhouse"
2,"No nonsence, the facts","I was fortunate to find this book early. It is written by a man who was actually on the ground as a local serving Police officer. It is written with feeling and sympathy for the unfortunate victims, who cascaded from the skies on to the small Scottish hamlet of Lockerbie.Mr Crawford then spent the next few years tracking the perpertrators of this unspeakable crime, around the world. He describes the horror at the outset,then follows every little clue, in true Sherlock tradition. He interviews suspects, talking to members of various Middle Eastern terror groups. He shares intelligence with other police forces from around the world, and his travels involving the investigation take you to the most unexpected corners of the globe. This is one great story, told by a very ordinary man who was determined to bring these terrorists to justice. John Crawford is destined for greatness in the detective story genre, and I'm eagerly awaiting his next work. Well recommended!"
4,Granny Did Good!,"My 12-yr. old grandson is always amazed at the stars in the sky at night, and loves science, so I thought a perfect Christmas gift for him would be a telescope. Well, he was so excited when he got it Christmas day, he put it together (with a little help from Dad), and has been star-gazing since. He's even shown me a couple of constellations. Nice product."
2,Telescope/refractor NG70SPR,"My son wanted so much to see the stars and the outer space, I decided to buy this refractor which is 100 dollars since reviews on cheaper ones were not good, I am disappointed to find you can see stars by your eyes much easier and clearer. Somehow it is not working right, I followed all instructions in the booklet and the DVD but no use. It is sitting there in one of the corners and I regret paying all this money for non functioning refractor"
4,An excellent railfan magazine,"""Railfan & Railroad"" is a must-read for the North American railfan. Combining top-quality photography with articles that are insightful and entertaining, this magazine has it all. ""R&R"" covers North American railroading past and present, and is a valuable resource to help railfans and railroaders alike stay up-to-date with the many innovations that are happening in the railroad industry."
5,Love this CD,"""Put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness"". ""Days of Elijah"" is a very good start ! I love this CD."
2,A GHOST STORY TO CURE INSOMNIA,"Looking for a ""polite"" ghost story? THE HAUNTING OF MARSTEN MANOR should please you.You'll also get little thrills, little plot coherence or anything that will scare you.The David and Julie Sapp family wrote, produced, edited, directed and star--Julie plays the ghost of Kate Marsten. Poor C. Thomas Howell shows up near the end as a wounded soldier and a key figure in the haunting.Brianna Davis, Ken Luckey, and Christine Brooks (24, FLASH FORWARD) fill out the cast and probably represent the bulk of the movie's budget.While a gore-free horror film is always welcome, a dull and tedious one is not the answer. The ""bonus"" film HAUNTED FROM WITHIN is no better and I reviewed it previously when it first appeared. For good ghost movies see the originals of THE INNOCENTS or THE HAUNTING and Peter Straub's GHOST STORY."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"These strips are thick and have a wax like appearance. I couldn't get them to stay put as they are very stiff. If you push them down on one side, the other side pops up. They also are too stiff to conform to the contours of my teeth. They don't stay in place. I don't recommend these strips."
4,Best Whitening Strips on the Market,"I read a review before purchasing these strips that these are the best on the market. If used properly, they will whiten your teeth. Unfortunately, after I used up all the strips in the box, my teeth slowly went back to their original state within a matter of weeks. Take note that I was a heavy smoker at the time I was using the product."
2,not so impressed,My son and I used these and didn't see much difference in color to our teeth. He said Crest white strips are the best.
3,Not so swinging,"Many of the songs on this CD are more early rock 'n' roll than any kind of swing. Most of them didn't seem that dancable, at least in the swing styles I'm familiar with.If you're into Lindy, I'd recommend against this. Buy Frankie Manning's Really Swinging Big Band Favorites instead.But there were some good tunes: Cole Slaw is great."
4,1st Person Narrative Really Gets You In Evan's Head,"I really enjoyed the 1st person narrative that the author uses to tell his story. A ""coming of age"" novel in which gay men can relate. Evan longs for love while finding only sex. The sex satisfies his hormones, yet he wants more... he wants normalcy. There's a clear under current hear that his orientation has developed from his enstranged relationship with his father. The characters are well drawn. Some of Evan's fantasies are hard to grasp and relate with in context to the story line. All in all, beautifully written."
3,I really wanted to like it ...,"The reason I bought this book was because an astute critic assured me that this book would resemble a favorite author of mine, Michael Cunningham. Unfortunately, that proved to be somewhat misleading. The only plausible and somewhat interesting character is the narrator, Evan, who is allowed to break out of stereotypical roles and offer to us insights into his mind.Everytime I felt like I was getting hooked into the story, something somewhat unbelievable and predictable pulled me away.Good attempt for gay fiction, not enough for interest.I honestly didn't expect much from Lawnboy, and received exactly that. I found little to be challenged by in this story, and most of the characters somewhat unfounded and cardboard."
4,interesting read,"I truly enjoyed this book especially the ending. He was a very couragous boy. I only have 2 questions, what happen to his brother and is there a sequel?"
3,"Characters Stunned, but Treatment Stunning","A gay high-school boy moves next door with a man, then works at his brother's run-down motel in sunbeaten, subtropical--and shabby, sullen--southern Florida. Yes the regional cameos of decay and blight are graphic. So is the depiction of interpersonal interaction among these gay men--however, they seem to display an also-""drifty"" quality short of true intimacy, mature treatment of the other, valid rapport. This disconnectedness seems to picture classic ""attachment disorder""--does the author either intend or realize this? A strength of the book is that we can decide this ourselves. As also about the ending--contrived, or realistic? It's subtly-enough done for ""each reader to decide."" If you like superb depictions of strip-mall shoddiness, plus insular-isolated male-male interrelations (albeit ignited with sex), visit this fictional corner of the real world."
4,does not work well with mac,"I have had this printer for years and it's thrifty and repair free. I switched from PCs to Mac but Epson does not offer a driver for Mac. After much time, I was able to get it to work, but when our printer drivers were accidentally deleted I had to start over. This setup also seems to get lost when I use my Mac in other locations. It will print from Pages, but Numbers is just finicky. It won't print spreadsheets correctly (no change to inspector) that it printed fine before. The preview looks great, the results are garbled. I try to track everything I've tried before, yet when/if I finally get it to work with Numbers, I'm never sure what was the magic piece of the connection puzzle. This is a fine wide carriage printer for a PC, a piece of junk for use with Mac Numbers."
1,Not a true solution,"I didn't find this method any different than the cry it out method. After all, you are just leaving your baby to cry in his crib...though the authors suggest only allowing so for an hour at naptime. Well, after an hour of sobbing uncontrollably, my baby could NOT get to sleep, and I was heartbroken that I even attempted this. There are gentler ways to help your baby sleep."
5,Good College Fun!,Great series. Clive and Renee are hilarious! Seen every episode at least twice...Can't wait for the next season. :) Keep it up!
2,For Japanese Readers Only,"Although written in English, this book is intended for a Japanese audience. Specifically, it is intended for Japanese businessmen. I found it somewhat interesting, but not at all helpful to me as an American. Additionally, the illustrations are awful (a forgivable sin, had the text been more useful). If you are Japanese and want to better understand Americans, then by all means read this book. If you are not Japanese, don't bother."
5,Good Ideas for home experiments,"I teach in elementary school and though not everything in this book is unique, it was really helpful. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to experiment at home, whether you're a child or a parent or a teacher."
5,"Brilliant, Fascinating, Useful, Easy","These books are brilliant! See also150 More Captivating Chemistry Experiments Using Household Substances. I couldn't be more delighted. I'm starting the entire chemistry program from scratch and Brian's books are SO helpful. Quick, easy-to-do, safe and fascinating demos/experiments with materials you can buy at a local store. I wish I had these books years ago. Brian organizes demos by topic to correlate with the high school chemistry curriculum. He also thoroughly explains each demo. His book is user-friendly. A life saver for chemistry teachers. EVERY chemistry teacher should have these books."
5,"Good book, good experiments","Recommended for highschool students with the help of a chemistry teacher, this book is a good introduction for experimentation extra-class in order to find pleasure for experimental sciences, in particular, chemistry."
5,Black Texas History,"This is a book that should be in the School History curriculum. Me being a white american. I was not exposed to the history of black americans. But the author refers to themselves as African Americans. But I really feel the term should be Americans (Americans with African decents) I was never aware of the history until now, other than media history. Which I feel that if America is going to get past this racial war, than the history needs to be brought forth. This book is a wonderful experience into the trials and tribulations that were experienced by the slaves of yesteryear."
4,Pretty overall,"This is not a large pendant. The peridot is very sparkly and shows up well. The iolite, however, is quite small and dark. Hard to tell it's blue unless you look closely. But it's a very pretty necklace overall. I'm sure I'll wear it often."
3,Pulp fiction is literature,This book shows that pulp fiction doesn't mean poorly written literature. I enjoyed it and would like to read more like it.
4,random read,"Grabbed as a freebie, nothing special but a good read. Goes good with scotch, a cigar and a warm summers night. Give it a try."
3,Great idea in a miniscule package,"Wow, I was thrilled when I ordered this for my husband's birthday...it was sort of for me too (hehe).Then I got it in the mail...This is a neat book with shockingly funny ads such as the following, ""Before you scold me, Mom...maybe you'd better light up a Marlboro""...this out of the mouth of an infant! YIKES!But at 5-1/4 by 6-1/2 inches, I can't read much of the advertising, even with my reading glasses AND a magnifying glass.Yes, I'm in my mid forties, but my eyes aren't that bad! The print on some of the ads is miniscule and I'm very, very, disappointed with that. I was actually searching the internet to see if I got the small version, but alas, this is it.The book is nice and solid and visually appealing though. The photos are beautiful and quite entertaining and the health claims and star commentaries are hilarious.If this book was 50% larger, it would have gotten a five."
5,Cat Watching by Desmond Morris,"The recipient loves this book, published in the 80s. I remembered it well, having purchased it back then. The only glich was that my friend had no idea who sent it, because there was no mention of the 'gifter' in the process. It's a great book and I am grateful that it was available for purchase. jvirden"
3,1st disk didn't work,"I was excited to get it. However, after getting it the first disk froze up and didn't work. It was not good, but the rest of it was okay."
2,The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season,"Enjoyed watching the episode on my kindle fire, but paying $1.99 per episode is too expensive. Will go to dept. store and buy each season. Need to be frugal in this day and age."
3,Ok except,These gawdawful songs yodeling in the background every five minutes ruins what is an otherwise good series.
2,Anti-great show,"I bought this during amazon's black friday event without knowing anything about it. The good news is that it was cheap, so I don't feel terribly slighted.The bad news: I see why it was so inexpensive. Yes, there's lots of taut early-20s flesh on screen, some interesting set designs and occasional snappy dialog, but that doesn't hide the recycled ideas shamelessly stolen from other sources. Nor does any of this succeed in distracting from the obvious plot developments and waiting ""surprises.""I suppose one could argue this series is meant as a tongue-in-cheek parody in the vein of Snakes On A Plane/The Expendables/RED, but The Vampire Diaries utterly fails to make such a case. It's just plain bad and best passed up."
2,"5 Stars For Show, 2 Stars for Price!","Geeze ... com'on CW - do you REALLY need to charge THAT much for a DVD (standard set)? Maybe if they didn't use so much music in these shows, the cost would not be so much! Love the show, but will wait till Amazon has a 50% off sale around the holidays!"
5,Oh My God!,"I read all the Twilight books, and have seen the movies (Hooked), then started watching True Blood (Hooked) I could not start another love of Vampires again, I gave this show a shot.....it took me a few eposides and I have to say I am sooooo hooked. What a cast, this is the first time I have to say that I have loved an entire cast of a show, ALL OF THEM. I also love the loyal, god guy to these vampire shows, Edward, Bill and now Stephen (oh my god) could he get any better looking......these brothers are super hot and the acting I think is amazing. I have decided I know longer want to be a Princess, I want to be a vampire....."
5,The Vampire Diaries is not just for teens,"I am a 72 year old great grand ma and this show keeps my heart beating. All I can say is it is a good thing I live in the country, so the neighbors won't call the cops when I am screaming at the TV. This show packs more into each ep, than most series do all year. The season one DVD has loads of bonus material that is worth the price of the disks. Ian Somerhalder is excellent as the bad boy Damon and I have cried, make that sobbed, buckets with and for him. He has really taken this character to the highest level of acting and looks so hot and sexy doing it. lol I had already fallen in love with Ian after watching the movie Changing Hearts, but have to say Damon is my favorite Vampire.I have all the eps on my DVR, but the disks are a must have and looking forward to season 2."
5,Love the Series,"I not one for teenager theamed movies, but I have to say I love the Vampire Diaries. I can not wait until March 25th to see new episodes."
4,good show,good show better when you can watch stright thre on blu raythen watching it every week on the cw and and the quality is bettervampires are good some of the plots and history sounds more realistic to.
5,Never disappointed by this series!,"The commentary is a good addition, however, I have not yet been able to watch full episodes with it due to its distracting nature. Very informative though. I watched the first season in record time, couldn't pull away! Awesome show!"
3,The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season,"I love everything supernatural, so I try to collect everything that it has to do with that. this season is good, but the only problem is that, back then when I purchase this item, I din't know I could return it if it was damage, now I know that. the season was freezing like in two disks. but the story it self is wonderful."
5,"LOVE, LOVE IT!",It's safe to say that I love the vampire diaries. This is the best show ever. I love the special features and interviews with the cast and crew. I watched the first season on TV but I was so happy to get this on DVD. If your a fan of vampire diaries this is a must have. This isn't anything like Twilight so if you hate that but love vampires this will be perfect for you.
4,I love vampires.,"I will admit I am biased. I like almost any vampire movie or tv show. I loved Buffy The Vampire Slayer. I think I will review it next.This is one I missed when it was on TV so I caught up using my amazon prime.I enjoyed this take. It is derivative but by now all of these are. The teen vampire trying to fit in and make it work with his girlfriend. Sounds familiar right, like a famous movie? Well it is better than the movie I thought."
4,"Ian Somerhalder, you are such a naughty boy but OH HOW I LOVE looking at you...","Let's me be honest here... I watched this series initially because of the fact there's some MAJOR eye candy. Yes, when it comes to Ian Somerhalder, I am amazingly shallow.That said... I tried reading the book series by the same name years earlier and I wasn't really into it so I cannot comment on the transition from book to TV show. I will say however that these actors and actresses can act. In addition, the plot is very interesting to me (a 30-something year old woman), even if it's geared toward a younger audience.If you enjoy shows like Supernatural, I think you'll like Vampire Diaries."
5,My weekly Twilight fix! LOVE this show!,"Stefan is the next best thing to Edward. This show is very similar to Twilight but with subtle differences. The story lines are very entertaining and keep you guessing as to what will happen week after week. It has some gory scenes sometimes but what do you expect when you're dealing with vampires. Damon is a great character on the show. I love him almost as much as Stefan. He's very quick-witted and plays the part of a bad boy perfectly. I love all of his little smart-alec remarks because he's completely serious when he says them even though what he says can be so mean. He cracks me up. If you need your Edward fix between the Twilight series' movies, The Vampire Diaries is a great way to get it."
3,Not very happy!!!!!!,I Love vampire diaries but the copy i just bought from here im not very happy with...even though it came in like 3 days when i opened what seemed to be the new plastic wrap and opened the case there was no clip thing for disc 3 so it was just in the case loose and when i started watching it the 1st episode on the 1st disc was already scratch i was very upset about it ....talk about it sucking your 1st time ever buying something online not sure i like it to much
2,Eye-candy for the simple minded,"If you are a white teen female, love romances, and never want to emerge from your cutesy world....This is for you!"
5,AWESOME!,"Watching Season 1 over again, I picked up alot of stuff I missed the first time. Now the series gets more in-depth. Watch for all the little pans the camera makes the next time you watch the show. There are clues to be gotten from that! Can't wait to get Season 2!"
4,Try it... You may like...,"I was one of the people who said that I would never watch this show. My sister rented it, and talked me into watching a few episodes. Needless to say, I kept watching. It is definitely not without its problems. There are a few annoying characters. The writing is pedistrian at times. These are blaring at points, but for every one of these problems there ia a huge twist or heartwarming moment that keeps me watching. Do not be fooled into not watching this show because of vampires in the title. The supernatural element is the best reason to watch."
5,Even Seniors like vampires,"My vampire memories go back to the days of Dark Shadows with Barnabus Collins.This series comes very very close to that. If you are a horror buff of any kind like myself, this is a wrap hit series for all ages. If you miss an episode you have missed a lot. So I set my DVR recorder to tape all episodes to keep up. Something new and good to look forward to every week.daries a"
4,Playing Unknown,"It is rather a blue paper toTwilightI had commented already, of which a comprehensive volume allows much more and better learning and understanding of the issues dealt with blood thirsty human creatures.A story of a town in Virginia happened being a hub of objects transforming.A work grasped attention with beautiful actors performing while things could be more realistic if producers knew of vampires' inability to reflect in mirrors."
4,Vampire Diaries,"Reminescent of the Twilight story - good vampire gone vegetarian, claiming ""his"" town off limits to bad vampires, protective of the girl. In spite of these similarities, it still makes for a good story. I like the diary angle, since it gives the viewer insight into what's going on in the heads of the main characters.There are interesting complications with one brother who turns to drugs and alcohol because he can't cope with the tragic loss of both parents; another brother who has an unspoken grudge against his brother, and wants to cause trouble for him when he returns to their home town after a hundred years or more; a psychic friend who doesn't quite realize that her powers are real, etc.This pilot kept my interest; I was entertained, and will definitely be looking forward to more."
2,I like it but....,I love The Vampire Diaries tv show but the Ubox is very annoying. When I bought this offline it said that I would be able to do what ever I wanted with it. But Iv tried and tried to download it onto and ipod and things like that but it will not let me. It makes me very mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Great story line but too much teen alchohol, drugs, and sexual content","Although the characters are beautiful and the story line is full of intrigue, I felt that there was too much openly diplayed teen alchohol, drugs, and sexual content that seemed too commonplace. There was none of that with Twilight and it was a huge hit. It is a big disappointment."
3,Vampire Diaries,"The diaries has the potential to be really good. But and here is a big but the previews seemed very highschoolish. Nothing new, same type things, plot as many others. Nothing that makes it stand out from the rest. Like ""Trueblood"" which is out standing. Violent at times, sexy which is great but you never know what happens next, not the same old dribble. Unfortunately unless the ""Diaries"" improve they are headed in the same dribble ""been there done that"" direction.Vampire Diaries"
4,Might be a good series,"I am a fan of the Twilight series, and before watching this I thought it sounded like a complete rip off. In most ways it is very similar to Twilight but after watching it I think it could hold it's own. The story is not bad at all. I do think the main vamp character (Stephan?) looks way too old to be a high school student, but he did say he was, what, over a century old? So maybe they were trying to make him look a bit older because of that. Some of the other students looked more like they should be in college or older. The show could do without the cheesy fog and crow, but I do like the special effects around Stephan's eyes when he starts to vamp out. Overall, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would."
4,Cheaper than iTunes but avail only on Kindle Fire (vs mobile phone),"Love that I saved $1 per episode over iTunes.Unfortunately, you cannot view it on a mobile device except the Kindle Fire."
4,A christmas gift,This was given as a christmas gift however the person that received it loved it and added it to her collection.
2,A little too cheesey,Too many similarities to the Twilight Saga. Good vampire/Bad vampire; friend that can see the future; jealous blonde girl; struggles with resisting vampire nature... The actors are really too old looking for high school. The scene where the brother is drinking a beer right in front of a policeman is ridiculous and the continuity suffers when Elena suddenly loses the red undershirt she was wearing at the beginning of the party. The fog is too much over the top. They don't need it to create a sinister mood.... The show will probably have a cult following but they really need to pay more attention to details and be a little more original.
5,Vampire Diaries-Complete First Session,I love the show. Definitely a nice gift to buy someone or yourself. Worth every penny. Received the product on time.
4,Vampires,"Enjoying the show, downloads to my hard drive so there is no pausing during viewing. If you like Vampire stories this one's pretty good."
4,Love these vamps!,"A friend recommended this series because he knew of my love for vampires. Didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Looking forward to the second season."
4,shades of twilight,"being a twilight fan, and an ardent lover of vampires,werewolves,and anything that goes bump in the night. i appreciate a good movie in that genre. this is a light version of Twilight, and certainly not Carpenters vampires. i enjoyed it, it did catch and keep my interest. i find the little twists that will lead up and onward fun.the cemetary and diary is good and different. although the fog is a little hokey. who knows it may get better as it goes along. i like the fact that it is nt filled with screaming and yelling.i will tune in again."
4,The Vampire Diaries,I think this will be a great series. However the free preview film was horrible!! It was like a stop action slide show. It would freeze and go and freeze and go all the while the dialog would continue. It makes it hard to follow because the dialog was ahead of the stop and go images. If you could get it to work properly I'd love to see it again so it makes better sense!!
3,I'll still watch it,"I like vampire stuff so I will still watch it. That said, I think if you took the prominent elements of Dark Shadows + Twilight and combined them with an overactive fog machine, you'd have it.It's totally unrealistic - every high school, I'm sure, is filled with beautiful people that look like 24 year old models. I haven't seen a zit yet!I imagine that the young kids unfamiliar with Dark Shadows will find this 'fresh.' Maybe I am old, but those kids might want to step back and watch the original (vampire episodes) Dark Shadows.They could do so much better with the sets. I like the crow."
5,I LOVE The Vampire Diaries & I re-watch the episodes over & over!,I heard a lot of good things about this show so I decided to check it out for myself. I am so glad I did as I am now a HUGE fan of the show and never get tired of watching it. I like this show even more than the Twilight Saga movies! I plan on purchasing Season 2 as soon as it is out. Season 2 is even better than Season 1...the show just keeps getting better and better!
5,Great television series,"I love it ! A lot of deleted scenes. Nice blu-ray disc, but it takes a while to open the files on my Blu-Ray player and I had to upgrade the firmware to be able to read it !"
2,Vampires 90210,"I tried. I really did try to like this show. But after a certain amount of stereotypical vamp-angst, teen drama, and bad acting, I finally quit. I gave it a fair chance--I think I quit 4 or 5 episodes in--but I just couldn't stand the level of the actors and even the script. The plot is okay, I suppose. If you're really into high school (or IN high school) and really into vampires... go ahead."
5,Well...,"First and foremost I am NOT a Roger Sanchez fan, (too commercial for me) but these mixes are SLAMMIN!!!...... Great classic tracks on here, and surprisingly, easily became a TUNE! preferred on the ""CHOICE"" mixes for me. Don't expect cheese on this one (plus several remixes and edits by the S-man himself!), Roger is digging deep in them crates!"
2,1st CD = weird,"Had to stop listening to the 1st CD, im listening to the 2nd one now and the first track is better than anything on the 1st. Maybe I'm just not a big fan but this is more lounge than house."
4,"Sketchy in places, but this is the standard history of opera","The paperback is reasonably priced, and includes all of the material of the often-specified-for-classwork hardcover text.The focus of the book is solidly on western opera, and in particular with the works and artists that have become canonical. The careful reader can distinguish between facts and opinions of which the book is filled with the former and has a thin layer of the latter as well.Conservative, heavily illustrated, and reliable are how I'd quickly describe the book."
4,Nice Tribal Progressive House. But expected a bit more...,"Most of the songs on the cd are amazing except for 2 which arent really my type. Some of the songs might start up really good from the beginning when u start hearing the voice and drums kick in, but some of the songs might start up average and as the music goes by it turns really good. so basicaly like in a club u usually hear the best stuff as time goes later.Bottom line is, this is good progressive house but for that price i expected a bit more. But thats just my thing, dont hezitate to buy this!"
3,Why include a R rated movie?,With so many Tom Cruise movies to choose from why did they have to include a rated R movie in this collection. I would have bought this in an instant if not for that.
3,Nice Collection,"Doesn't Come in Separate packs, all the blurays are in one pack.Bought the product when it was cheap.. Good for the price...."
4,Great set BUT...,"The set is great with a great selection of movies but I have one complaint not related to it's condition. Two of the movies, Collateral and War of The Worlds, were filmed using some kind of weird filter that has a REAL grainy feel to them. This makes buying them on BluRay pointless because it's like watching a movie from the 30s. Like I said, nothing wrong with the packaging or anything just these two movies which some director thought it would be ""cool"" to put a grainy effect on them....NOT."
5,Favorite younger male star,"I have watched Cruise become a great star - I do love his acting abilities and how he really gets the character into his head to play the parts so well. Keep up the great work, Tom..."
5,The Latino Wave,The Latino Wave is a must read for anyone wanting an understanding of what is happening in the immigration situation today.
5,Amazing Jewlery Value,"My fiancee and I bought this for her mother, who is a blonde and looks absolutely radiant in this necklace. It adds a perfect touch of class to any outfit, just like one of the previous reviewers said (thanks!).The 6.0-6.5 mm pearl size is perfect. I would not go smaller, especially since this is thirty five bucks.The chain is not itty-bitty as some have suggested. It's not a rope of gold, but it is proportioned well relative to the pearl.The setting for the pearl is nice: neutral, yet not boring.Item arrived in top-notch condition, including a nice clasp box and outer hard box, in royal blue. Only lousy part is that outer box has a big inventory sticker on it, so it gets sticky if you want to give this item to someone in the nice blue box with the fuzzy box inside. A little Goo Gone will take care of that.In any event, that one minor downside aside, excellent value on an excellent piece of jewlery!"
2,good action score that fails on cd,"This score to the Jamie Lee Curtis action horror thriller is scored for full symphonic orchestra and, in one cue, male chorus. The music has no memorable theme to tie the material together and at times becomes very unpleasant to hear. This is not a bad score, just an unpleasant listen away from the movie. This is one CD you'll play once and probably never again."
2,light head sags,"Decent lighting, but the head is too heavy for the arm and sags down from where it is positioned. If I had it to do over, I'd look for a different lamp. Not worth the price."
3,"Looks Like Prince, Sounds Like Hendrix...","...not a bad thing in either respect, but I am hopeful that Ladell steps out a bit more on future releases.Guitarwise, McLin is fantastic...an amazing tone, and there's some real power in his playing...vocally, he sounds way too much like Hendrix, in his inflection and his propensity to talk his way through songs.Good cover of Albert King's ""I'll Play the Blues 4U,"" and while he got the chops down fine on ""TNT,"" give me AC/DC's rendering over it.""Rich Man's Lounge"" is a good track, and in fact they're all well done, and I dig the power trio thing McLin's got going.I expect we'll hear a whole lot more from this one."
1,misreprenresented,"The item I purchased was misrepresented. I thought I was a whole table. I wouls send it back if I could but it will cost me more in shipping than its worth. If this is not corrected I will close my account. You have checked my credit and it is outstanding and I will buy from another consumer and I always pay on time. Thank you Terri Darnell, 2600 shelton mission road Greeneville, Tennessee 37743"
5,"2x4basics Picnic Table Kit, Sand, 17310","This is just what I was looking for to put on my deck. I bought the wood necessary for the table and benches and it was very convenient to put together. However, there was one problem I have, maybe two. The instructions called for spacing the boards 1/4 inch apart on the table requiring new holes in the plastic. The predrilled hows would not line up with the wood with the 1/4 inch spacing/ I had to go back and remove each board after drilling holes and reduce the spacing. There was too much over hang for the last board on each side of the table top. Another problem I see is with the material the screws are made of and whether or not the treated lumber I bought will corrode the screws or not. Only time will tell."
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!,"People, stay away from this ridiculous band!!! They dress like a rock act, They got a lot of tattoos but in fact it's a mediocre pop band with guitars! PLEASE, YOUTH OF THE WORLD...Don't think that this crap is rock!If you want to see rock you gotta search in the past for bands like RAMONES, LED ZEPPELIN, DEEP PURPLE....Forget this Emo pile of garbage!If i could give ZERO stars i give!"
5,Memories...,"Being a fan of Rurouni Kenshin, just having finished the TV series and looking forward to the movies and OVA, this CD was a must. I love Tactics and One Half and already know the lyrics from watching the episodes! I listen to the CD while looking at manga and artbooks.It was a must for my music library. A lot of time and money went into the making of these soundtracks and it was worth it! The CD would make a great gift for kids - upbeat and fun!"
4,Great Saute Pan,"Actually, I'd wanted a 12 inch All Clad Saute pan, but they don't make a 12 inch saute with a helper handle on the opposite end. This (CIA Masters Collection) pan DOES have one, and is every bit as well made (if not better, since it has an aluminum AND copper core). And like All Clad -- it's hefty -- so when you add food it helps to have the helper handle. It performs flawlessly. I'm glad I found one that meets all my requirements."
3,"Good performing pan, but it warped","I bought this hoping to make this my go-to pan for most dishes. It distributes the heat pretty well, cooking my chicken cutlets nicely even up on the edge. Sears pretty well not losing much heat from a cold piece of meat. My problem is that I have a glass top stove, and after about 4-5 uses it developed a warp where the center of the bottom bumped out just enough so that the pan now spins like a top when set on my glass cooking surface. Urrgh! I didn't think I abused it by dousing it in cold water too quickly, but I don't know...must have. I thought the 7 layers helped match the thermal expansion so this wouldn't happen, but no. Don't buy this unless you are ridiculously careful with the cold water wash or don't have a flat cooking surface."
4,Good Geology Book,"Geology is not the funnest subject ever, but this is a good book with my college Lab class."
3,"Don't buy from DJS9, desent book though","DJS9 should not be trusted with time sensitive orders. Placed order 2 weeks ago, and he only now cancels order without any peep before hand, I already missed 2 hmwk assignments."
2,pages missing,The product is in good condition except that I went to start my first lab and there is pages that are torn out. I had to borrow someone elses book and make copies. I dont think you should sell a book back if all the pages are not in the book especially the pages with the questions on them!!
5,Great literature.,The book was exactly what I needed for my class and I didn't miss a beat during class. Recommended if needed for your classroom needs.
2,Problems with Kindle Version,"I saw that this was available for Kindle for cheaper than paperback, so I decided to purchase it as textbooks are expensive enough. The book itself is fine content-wise; it is for a fairly basic geology class and therefore it is fairly simple. However, our professor makes us turn in the lab assignments straight from the pages in the lab book, and that becomes a problem with the Kindle edition. Luckily through other programs I have been able to make it work, but it causes me about an extra hour and a half per week of work that must be done to make Kindle pages usable for the lab. If you are going to buy this for Kindle, make sure that your professor will accept the labs as another format (spreadsheet, write-up, etc). My professor has been very lenient with me on this, but not all will be. I would honestly just recommend that any student shell out the extra cash and buy the paper version. It just makes life much easier."
5,Lab Manual,"great; no problems, shipped on time in great condition! No markings, all the pages were there (in tact) and got a great use out of it!"
2,Manual Review,The last lab manual I got came quickly. When I started class I soon realized I was missing some lab assignment sheets and a tools sheet out of the back. Otherwise it was fine.
1,Falsely advertised as being New.,"Falsely advertised as being new. This manual is full of markings and in poor condition. The manual was advertised as ""new"" though it is clearly used. I could have purchased 5 truly used manuals for the cost of this purchase."
2,missing pages,a lab book is useless if it is missing the pages which have the questions for the labs. Dissapointed.
1,Terrible lab manual,"I inherited this lab manual when I started teaching physical geology this semester, and I told my students to return it to the bookstore. It contains factual errors (such as referring to hornblende and other non-metallic minerals as metallic, which they are not - metallic minerals are opaque in thin section), and the pedagogy is highly questionable. In the rock and mineral sections, it relies too heavily on photographs. Students already have a tendency to want to simply match minerals and rocks to pictures, which doesn't work, and this book encourages this. The book is too much talk and not enough action. Students in a lab should be guided to work with objects, not to simply answer questions out of a book. There is too much explanation provided, with little left for students to figure out on their own. Labs should be presented to students as mysteries to be solved, and this book takes all the mystery out of everything."
1,Geology Prof.,"This ""lab manual"" is VERY thick and far too wordy. Really, it's more of a spiral-bound textbook than a lab manual. Additionally, the lab questions appear in list format at the end of each section, so there is virtually no standardized answersheet for students to record their work on. That not only makes it harder on the students, but efficient grading is nearly impossible unless the instructor makes his/her own taylor-made answer sheets for the students to use on EACH lab. As if that weren't bad enough, the lab manual's companion web site is horrid. I am amazed that the AGI and the NAGT produced this lab manual."
2,pages,"I know that when I buy a used book it's not going to be perfect (although I have received perfect ones. I was very satisfied with this one until I had to do a specific lab for homework and the pages were missing. There was nothing in the description that suggested that there were pages missing. If there was, I would not have bought it, obviously. I take my classes online and don't have easy access to my classmates and it was difficult to find someone who could scan the missing pages and send them to me. Needless to say I was not happy. Very frustrating."
1,Yuck!,"Although I loved my Intro to Geology class, I HATED this lab manual! UGHHHH! It isn't even a lab book, it is more of a ""let's read some more"", and have some very difficult questions at the end, that I could hardly understand to answer, even though I read all the text! I am a 4.0 Student and I hated it! Not to mention there are no answers anywhere to check your work, as I took this course online. This book almost made it impossible to learn and apply the concepts. Luckily we weren't graded on them or else I would have failed the course. Goodluck if this is required for your class! :("
1,Lab Manuel Missing Pages,"I found that some very important pages were not in the book. I had to order another book, which of course cast me more money."
4,Because they asked me to,"I bought this book for school, since my school was out of the book and this one was cheaper. It does the job, it is probably less expensive than your school, and you can't get a used one because usually some of the pages you need are missing."
4,reading,these book has a lot of different learning activies in it. it has words like pig anf dig and the child has to figure out whitch letter is missing. it has rhyming pictures where they have to pick the two pictures that match. It has begining letters that are missing and they have to pick the letter that goes with that word. this activity book is very helpful. i wanted to get this at walmart but they were sold out so i ordered from amazon. if i were you i would see if walmart had it before i payed for shipping. This is a great book for children learning how to read.
3,only have good songs,"I liked the 3 songs from this anime, the opening, the ending, and the insert song. The music is fairly generic anime music with nothing special or outstanding. If you want good music, try animes with music composed by yoko kanno such as escaflowne and brain powerd"
2,Disappointed,"I recently bought James for my 3 year old son. The train works, but is very slow. We already had Thomas' Jet engine so maybe we got spoiled by jet's supersonic speed. It still seems as though James falls off the track and sputters on the hills way too often. Seeing as The Jet engine is starting to fail I'm continuing my search for a replacement (James didn't fit the bill). I just put in an order for Brio's green rechargeable 4 wheeled engine with the battery back-up. I'm hoping that one does the trick.Follow-up:I bought the ""green monster"" from Brio. It is also pretty slow but that's OK.The rechargeable battery is great and the train itself is much more versatile as it can push as well as pull long trains."
1,James broke on day 2,"Ok, maybe it's just me, but you'd think that a battery operated train designed for toddlers should be able to withstand, oh, I don't know . . . toddlers. Our toddler doesn't quite get that he can't push James around like he can the non- battery operated trains. It appears that pushing him (rather than letting him motor on his own) stripped the gears. Now the light goes on, but the wheels won't turn. That was a big waste of $30."
3,it broke,my three-year-old somehow broke the starter. now it's just another push train. a very expensive one at that!
2,defective--only two front wheels are turning,"Our battery operated James is defective. At first we thought that this train is different built than our other battery operated train Salty and therefore weaker. Salty operates almost perfectly, chugs up the hills and takes the turns, whereas James could not go up hills and could not pull wagons, and overall seemed much slower than Salty. Upon closer inspection and comparison with Salty (after return period was already over), we discovered that for Salty 4 wheels are powering the movement (eg., battery makes two front wheels and two back wheels turn), whereas for our James only two front wheels are turning. Of course, it makes sense that this way James cannot move as fast and as well as Salty. So our James is defective...hoping that we can exchange it."
3,"Great concept, poor execution","The battery-power James is mostly metal rather than wood (his tender is still made of wood) and is perhaps more rugged than the wooden Thomas & Friends engines. He is heavy, well-detailed and durable and is a very fine-looking engine. Toddlers will have no problem starting and stopping him, as the on/off switch is a large button that blends into the top of the driver's cab. And the working headlight is really cool.However, once James gets rolling, he frequently derails off of our wooden railway or gets stuck. His pulling power is also pretty weak. Quite often, the magnet is unable to hold more than 3 cars (especially when heading uphill), and poor James speeds off while his freight cars or coaches are left behind."
2,Derails,"We have Battery Operated Thomas and Battery Operated James. Other than the color they look very similar, and, I suspect, use the same mechanics. Unfortunately, James derails very often on the same tracks that Thomas has no problem navigating. I have two tracks: a coal sifter figure 8 and the oval starter kit from Target. James derailes on each one of the tracks separately as well as on the layout I created by combining the two sets. Sometimes it'd go around fine one time and then derail on the second run - very strange. Battery Operated Thomas almost never derails.On the positive side, my two-year old son loves these trains."
5,James and Coal Car,Our 7 yr old twins are still playing with the Thomas set and this was a nice addition. The Battery powered engines are popular with the older children. Plus this had an extra car.
2,If it worked consistently it would be amazing,"As soon as the batteries were in my son was not interested in opening or looking at any other Christmas gifts. Sadly, it stopped working within the first hour of playing. My dad was able to jostle it back to life a few times and we changed the battery once and it worked again for about 10 minutes. Now it is completely dead. And its wheels don't work like the regular trains so my son can't use it manually either. We absolutely have to return it. I have read that the battery powered Thomas works better, so we will try to exchange it for that one. It had no problems staying on our imaginarium tracks, pulling cars or going up hills when it was working. If it worked consistently it would be the perfect toy. For $30 it should be more reliable. It is NOT a ""very useful engine."""
2,Does not stay on curved track.,"This engine is cute and seems to be well constructed. It does a good job of going up ramps, is easy to turn on and off, and takes a single battery. However, it kept running off any curves in the train track. We decided to return it and look for something that will stay on our son's track."
3,"Nice product, but it had short life",I bought two battery powerd trains at the same time. One of them was broken after a month or so. Engine did not work any more :(
3,close but not quite,"This train is well built. The metal work is very nice. It would be better if the tender was made from the same material so that it matched. The only issues with this engine is the pulling power and overlytight fit on the track. The motor will click and grind just going around turns and uphills. The engine will also get stuck on tracks that are just slightly misaligned. The casting is great and the switch is nice as well, but pulling just isn't its thing."
2,"Terrible, and that's why you should buy it.","As the one star review below warns you, this is awful. It's confusing. The acting's hammy even for guy-with-a-camera-and-computer indie horror. I loved it. It has Robert Z'Dar and Conrad Brooks. Why are you still reading? Click that BUY button!"
4,African American Genealogical Sourcebook,"It provides interesting, detailed historical overview along with many regional and state-specific resources for tracking genealogy. I'm just getting started on a search that may yield very little. This may be an important guide."
3,Right idea but could be better,"The ""old"" gyroscopes from my day seem to do better (1960's). I wished it would stay at higher rate of speed to show the effects of the gyroscope better."
2,Lasted One Day,While my son and I were both excited to have this new toy. It broke in one day. First the krank that you pull wore out (the teeth) so you couldn't spin it as fast....then the plastic circle with the ring got off balance.Not worth the money.Pretty disappointing.
2,lacks precision,"inferior quality compared to the metal one that I had as a child. This one spins for a much shorter period of time and is not calibrated well, I can note some vibration on it, etc. etc. Only good looks and no precision quality."
4,Gyroscope review,"The product is really fun, but I was very disappointed with the shipping. It arrived on time, but the packaged was almost destroyed and the contents within the gyroscope box were scattered all in the package. None of the parts were damaged, so I didn't make a big deal about it. Good product though.William Waddle"
4,Interesting,Gyroscope is fine but the pull string is seeming to wear out already. Could use a second pull. Enjoyable though.
2,Good while it lasted!!,"This gyroscope was good intially and my son had a lot of fun with it, but it didn't last very long. The plastic cord is not very durable and it become flat after a few days of usage. It's sitting in his table now, since he cannot use it anymore. Spend a few bucks more and go for a better quality gyroscope."
3,unhappy with compaq,"I love my ipaq but the lack of service provided by Compaq makes this project almost worthless. When you finally get finished being transferred from one line to another the person on the line cannot even begin to help you. Even worse is trying to get anything, or any information from the web site. It is worthless. I have a strong distaste for anything related to Compaq."
1,Do not buy from this seller,This was a $150 dollar item that never arrived. I contacted the seller 3 times without a reply. Also I am not the only one...check the history. Do not buy from this seller! I have waited over a month and I now have to go through a 2 week refund process....
3,"fun, but sometimes a little to tough","my four year old likes this game, but sometimes get a little frustrated with the brigde building activity, he just does not understand that concept, plus there is only 4 different missions to do and once there done, whats left to do???"
5,Tulsa Girl Makes Good,"Recently, I had the pleasure of reading Elizabeth Ashwood's first novel, The Red House. Having grown up in the Tulsa area, I was very proud to see this exciting, mind-bending drama with the Tulsa back-drop. Elizabeth's characters are dynamic and entertaining, they weave their way through this tragic story effortlessly and read like people you've known your whole life. Toward the middle of the book I found myself actually caring what happened to Cera, the main character, which truly had to be Ms. Ashwood's goal. I actually found myself scared at times, not sure if I even wanted to uncover Cera's secrets. I know I'll never look at a rusty old axe the same way again!! The climax when Cera goes back to her home and confronts her nemesis (I won't give this away here!) is just thrilling. Excellent first novel, excellent excellent craft. I would recommend this book to any Tulsan, for that matter, anyone looking for a good read!"
5,What A Revelation,"A book to bring you into the knowledge of how witchcraft is very present in the church and to teach you how to fight, fast and pray against the work of witchcraft in the church, ministry, home or other places that we may not think where it's operating."
1,extremely UNINFORMED!,"In my opinion this book makes it look like SOMEONE didn't do very much research! Quite frankly, I hope that Ruth Brown Never writes another book that bashes any religion, like this book did! If you're buying this book to get a honest veiw of modern witch craft then you are going to be VERY disappointed. Like just about everyone on this page of reveiws has said, This book is just causing more ignorence and hate."
1,HYPOCRITICAL LIES,"TO ANYONE BUYING THIS BOOK I DON'T KNOW WHO THE AUTHOR THINKS SHE IS, BUT WITCHCRAFT IS NOT EVIL.IT IS A BEATIFUL WONDERUFL RELIGION AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SO CALLED SATAN. NO TRUE WICCAN WTICHES BELEIVE IN SATAN. I'M NOT WASTING MONEY ON THIS BOOK AND I'M UNSURE OF EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS,BUT PLEASE,ANYONE THINKING OF BUYING THIS,PLEASE DON'T. ACCEPT PEOPLE OF OTHER RELIGIONS INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN BECAUSE YOU ARE INSECURE IN YOUR OWN FAITH. IT'S SO WRONG TO CRITISICE WITCHES WHEN YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM,AND ITS CLEAR YOU DIDN'T RESEARCH IT. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!! WICCA IS A GREAT RELIGION IN WHICH NO EVIL HAPPENS. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE RUTHY, I'M GLAD YOU HAVE YOUR BELEIFS, BUT NEVER EVER PUSH THEM ONTO OTHER PEOPLE.IT IS A FORM OF BRAIN WASHING. IT'S ABUSE."
5,Just what I needed!,Reading this book was just what I needed. I wish I could have read it one year earlier. I'm sure I would be further along in my journey.
1,"Totally inacurate, a book written to fuel ignorance","I was interested in this title because I have a close friend who is a Witch, and I wanted to make sure she wasn't getting into something bad. This book did not help me at all- I know very little about modern Witchcraft, but this book was way off! It was like I was reading something written in the 1600's, not the 1990's! The references to 'Witchcraft' bear no resemblance to any religion practiced by Neo-Pagans today, of this I'm sure- this book is simply written to feed off of and fuel the ignorance of people who don't know any better, and I actually regret reading it, because that is time in my life I have now lost forever, and I could have done something better with it. I'm ashamed to concider myself Christain if this is the company I keep."
1,Not fair to Wiccans,"If you believe Witches fly on broomsticks, sacrifice babies and worship Satan, this is the book you've been waiting for. However, if you are looking for a reasonable, balanced and FAIR critique of Wiccan and pagan beliefs from a Christian perspective, you'd best keep searching."
1,HATE LITERATURE!!!,"This has got to be some of the most hateful writings I have seen in a long time! This has nothing to do with real witchcraft. It is the same type of propaganda that was used during the witch trials to set humans ablaze.When ceasar Nero did it to early christians it was considered a tragedy.When witches are treated the same way its considered a service.Please do not buy this book.If you want to know about real witches,go to a wiccan website for free."
1,witchcraft in the church.,"My goodness, this is just another book on the market aimed at spreading misinformation and lies to those who will believe it and buy it. This book, along with others like it, are just as bad as televangelists lying to the public, claiming that God told him to collect $10,000 from his viewers so he can buy a private jet. People need to understand that witchcraft is PRE-CHRISTIAN; there is NO devil in The Craft! Christianity took the dates for Pagan holidays (Yule into Christmas, Ostara into Easter, etc) along with gods (into some saints), yet the vast majority of these ""good Christian"" writers aren't even aware of this!Now onto the book...Whatever happened to ""doing unto others""...? Obviously, Brown didn't take this into account. Good Christian? I think not."
5,Excellent Book For Spiritual Warriors - Protection For God's Children. Destroy The Works of Witchcraft,"Excellent Book for God's Children.Destroying The Works Of Witchcraft Through God's Power.Witches are out to try to destroy your life.They must remember that in the end, they are only destroying themselves, because God's children will be saved but they are the ones who will perish in hell fire. As the bible states, there will be nothing left of them and God's enemies will be like dust under the soles of our feet. ""And ye shall tread downthe wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet."" Mal 4:3.Remember: What goes around comes around for all you witches.From Angel"
2,Cloying beauty,"Hardly more then a highly derivative post-soft-rock delivery, but a few tracks manage to get off the ground instead of dragging dead weight."
2,"Old style type and graphics, writing doesn't flow.","It's not a book that makes you want to read it, I find myself just skimming through it. The author can barely go a page without mentioning ""the dot-com global workplace"", I find that very annoying. There are some interesting case studies but she doesn't give any suggested outcomes so the reader is left wondering what is the best course of action."
2,Reads like a textbook,"This book is required reading for a Masters level course, which is the only way it will ever get read. In a subject area bulging at the seams with real-life, practical hindsight, this book truely shows the difference between academia and those working stiffs who are just trying to make a living.I will say one thing however - the teacher made the class enjoyable. I was sitting there in class one evening, enjoying the reparte between student and teacher, when I realized:""Hey! I'm actually learning something here."""
4,useful and thoughtful tips,"This book literally listed more than 1000 tips and tools, covering every detail of presentation. You get ""10 Hot Tips for Flip Charts and White Boards"", ""46 Ideas: Starting Off on the Right Foot""... The author is meticulously thoughtful. First read ""5 ways to get the most out of this book"" and then study the detailed Table of Contents. From there you can select what would be of interest to you. A lot seems to be common sense. Yet it is still good to be reminded, e.g. avoid: starting late, or starting with an apology, or an equipment failure. This is not a book for reading from cover to cover. But it is valuable for presentors or trainers to come back to it again and again."
2,Disappointed,Very easy reading material. This book is for the beginner; someone who has absoulutely never taught anyone before and who had not chosen teaching as a profession. Anyone who has instructed for 6 months or more will already know most of what is in this book. I was disappointed. I was anticipating new concepts and ideas.
2,"Sorry, but no.","Sorry, but I can't take seriously anything that lists Seventeen magazine as a feminist resource for young women. I read this when I was still a teenager, the target audience, and still found it awful."
5,Read this book!,"If you're a feminist or curious about the herstory of feminism, you must read this book. It's a fabulous discussion of the merit and downfalls of feminism. Also, it contains valuable information about feminist organizations, zines, non-profits, etc. across the country. It doesn't read like mundane homework, but makes a clear assertion of where feminism has been, where it is now, and where it hopes to be. Read this book."
2,"Disappointing, but a good start","I had high hopes for this book. I found the authors to be too far removed from the feminism most of GenX knows--the day-to-day battles we face. Instead, the authors are so entrenched in feminism they have lost sight of where everyone else is at. They have created their own soap box from which to spout their opinions on other feminist. They are obviously from a publishing background. Almost everypage seemed to rant about a feminist ""zine"". Maybe I should have been a Second Wave Feminist instead of a Third Waver--I still call them ""magazines"". Although it isn't exclusively a third wave feminist book, I would recommend ""Flux"" instead."

2,Uninspired,"Firstly the tracklist for this single does not match up with the cover art picture shown for the listing, the same goes for the part 2 single listed on amazon.So if your buying this cd based on this cover you are getting the 3 track single + video.In regards to the tracks listed for this item (Silence and Blind), they are fairly uninspired songs with a very 'going through the motions' sound rather than the usual quirkey, emotional or uplifting numbers. One for the completist (i.e. myself!). Both songs are also found on five men in a Hut so you can save yourself some coin and just get that."
4,Good but not exellent.,"This CD is a digital remastering of a recital that Michelangeli gave in Turin. For the sound isn't the traditional on a typical CD, but it can pass. The pieces that Michelangeli offers in this record are from the piano traditional repertoire. All the classical music fans know this pieces and everybody is agree that they are marvellous. But I think that Michelangeli can do a better interpretation that this one. I'm agree that lots of pianists, who belongs to a lower category in this little world, do worse versions than this one. But people in the selected few (and Michelangeli belongs to the selected few of the piano) like Zimmerman or Argerich take a beautiful sound to the piano, this sound that Chopin wants and Michelangeli doesn't offer. Although, Michelangeli does a correct version, but not the version that I would like when I listened his glorious version of the Images and the Children's corner of Debussy.I only recomended this record to the fans of Michelangeli."
5,Good Book,"I read the book in my local library. Being an ex-student of Robert Beck, I wanted to see the final product of something he had been working hard on since before I knew him. I was completely impressed with amount of research put into the book, and the work putting into cross-referencing. Whether you want to look up a subject of a film, such as heart attack, or a film he was in, it is in this book. It is a good book for fans, and a great reference book for those who need the information."
5,Great!,I read this book when I was a teenager and feel n love with the low down character. When hurricane Katrina hit I lost my whole book collection.this was one of the books that was hard to find .thank u Amazon for giving me back something I never thought I'd find again.
5,the perfect heroine,I love strong woman who do what they need with out all the fan fair... yay to Maggie Osbourne for writing about real women
5,silver lining,I really enjoyed this book! It was just a little bit different from what I had been reading. Very sweet book.
5,It's like Psychobilly/Surf. Play it LOUD!! It Kicks butt!!,"I loved ""Savage."" It's like the Ventures on Meth! ""Doctor Brown"" also rocked. They have a ballsy Psychobilly sound, with just a little bit of twang to make your mouth water! Can't wait to see what they come up with next."
1,Disappointing,I thought that this would be gummy. I had some sticky putty like substance that was this size and came in a roll. I used it for flower arrangements and helping candles stand up in their holders. This was basically white paper. It held nothing and was useless. The postage to send it back was more than the cost. So it's just sitting in a drawer waiting to find a use for it.
4,decent amount of content for licensed nhl dvd!!!!!!!,"i got this a while ago. i've watched it a few times and it has great audio and video quality. great interviews with past and present players, and some great extras. the only thing it lacks is MORE HIGHLIGHTS. i'm the type of person who can watch hockey highlights all day long. but for this price its good for the content you get. i think the comparisons from today's great players to former NHL legends is pretty close, also. just an overall well constructed dvd and NHL keepsake. !!!!!!!!!!! :)"
2,What a let down...,"This album made me want to break down and cry. I was really hoping to hear some more of the low end funked out basslines from the ""Attack of the Analog Worms"" disc. I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one let down by Mr. O. this time around. It just sounds like someone compiled a bunch of chopped up and random sounds together and hit the record button. I know there could have been much more to this release but it just didn't happen, at least not for me anyway. If you are expecting the electronic head nodding bliss of ""Flat Beat"" you may consider looking elsewhere."
3,Bull,"Nice Case. but, a little pricey for what it is. Memory stick offered by Office Depot did not show and they would not honor. u might get it for cheaper elsewhere."
4,One Of The Best Fantasy Novels Of The Year,"A friend gave me this novel, telling me I would enjoy it. She was right; I haven't even returned it yet. While this novel occasionally indulges in sentimentalism it is also insightful and full of love. The characters are both quirky and down-to-earth, their plights believable, and their lives touching."
4,A cross between 100 Yrs of Solitude and Fried Green Tomatoes,"Not the fantasy/SF Sean Stewart's fans might expect, but a kind of funny southern gothic, with a little magic realism thrown in for good measure. I've read all Stewart's books, but this one is far and away the best - and includes the most hysterical, and accurate description of morning-sickness I've ever read. (All I'll say it that it involves a revolving restaurant, a Cobb salad, and a voodoo curse.) If you've not yet discovered Stewart, here's the place to start. And if you already know his work, get ready to enjoy."
1,Written for the Intellectual Elite and Not the Average Reader,"Ralph Nader has been around for some time and has had his day.He claims to be a populist, caliming to be for the people. However, when you read his books, you can see that he is really writing for the sake of the intellectual elite. He does not write to acoomodate average readers thus failing to get his point through to them. Well, so much for being a populist and a man of the people.Nader just does a lot of talking and writing and accomplishes nothing.In the presidential election, all he succeeded in doing was drawing votes away from Al Gore allowing George W. Bush to win the election giving us eight more years of Reagan-Bush policies which have ultimately led us to this financil disaster on Wall Street and all over the United States."
1,Nader's Despicablility is On Display Here,"This book from Ralph Nader, George Bush's best ally and secret weapon, shows why the great New York Times writer Thomas Friedman has accurately described Nader as a creature of the lunatic fringe of American politics. Nader's connection to reality is extremely tenous. He is a latter-day Luddite, and his proposals have no chance of ever being adopted. This is why he has chosen the role of spoiler. If he can't be President, he reasons, why should Al Gore? Better to let a right-wing monster like George W. Bush become President and destroy the country!"
1,Loquacious and another world,"For a person living and working in the British Isles, 'Teach Yourself Copywriting' by J. Jonathan Gabay may be a fine read. But I don't live there. Residency aside, I found this book to be overly wordy to the point of feeling like I was slogging through swamps of verbiage to find a useful morsel. And there are useful bits there, it's just that it boarders on not being worth the time and effort to get to them. Someone interested in the topic of copywriting would do better to read similar books by Robert Bly or Peter Bowerman, both much more interesting and succinct; my apologies to Brits everywhere."
3,Meh,"I guess if I was a hungry Kalahari bushman running fifty miles a day this might answer a need but speaking as a plump, hard-working yet sedate French farm wife in modern America, I have to say a couple strong cups of coffee has more effect. Just sayin."
3,Not bad,"This stuff is fine for the money but I have realized I'd rather get my calcium from the eggshells of the eggs I am already using. Why pay more money for a supplement when you're probably throwing out calcium every day?One whole medium sized eggshell makes about one teaspoon of powder, which yields about 750 - 800 mgs of elemental calcium plus other microelements, i.e. magnesium, boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, sulphur, silicon, zinc, etc. There are 27 elements in total. The composition of an eggshell is very similar to that of our bones and teeth.All you have to do is take the shells from raw eggs (rinse them first!) or boiled eggs, lay them out on a baking sheet and leave them out overnight to dry. Then grind them in a coffee grinder. I've read that they can be stored in a glass container but I just keep mine in a ziplock baggie.Think of all the plastic bottles you won't add to the landfills by doing this! :)"
1,this song is really bad,"There is nothing at all original or compelling about this song. It's totally forgettable. Prince hasn't released a decent album since Graffiti Bridge and he hasn't released a decent song since Gold. For over 10 years I've endured his reinventions and promises of a 'return to greatness' which is why I bought this single. Again, I was disappointed. I won't buy this record if THIS is THE hit that the record company is telling us to buy. This song is the final nail in the coffin of ""Prince."""
1,He's gotta be kidding,"this is possibly the worst prince single to ever precede the release of a new album. ""old friends for sale"" has ten old tracks on it and they each are better songs than this (ok, maybe not ""my little pill""). so this is what he thinks will get audiences psyched-up for the new cd?"
3,"Nice Melody, but a little let down","I'm sorry I am a HUGE Artist fan, and I have followed him since DIRTY MIND way back when. I am very psyched about RAVE, but this single kind of deflated my expectations. Sorry, but I did listen to it all day and it never really grew on me. But I say it's got a very cool melody and I love the lyric ""this is where u end and u and I begin"". I remember listening to AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAY and I did not like RASPBERRY BERET so maybe I am just bugging for no reason."
3,HE'S BAACK! IS HE?,"WELL,I HATED IT THE FIRST TIME I LISTENED BUT,NOW I SEE IT AS THE BRILLIANTLY CALCULATED MOVE HE HAD TO MAKE. VERY CATCHY ARRANGEMENT. STILL, PLEASE LET THE ALBUM KICK HARDER. IT'S GETTING SO HARD TO DEFEND HIM TO THE OTHERS."
2,very run of the mill,it is just like alot of his 90's stuff average at best and coming from him that ain't to good. hopefully the album is better.
4,It grows on you.,"Not my favorite song by The Artist, but it does grow on you. I found myself singing the tune upon waking up in the morning. Can't wait for the whole album to come out. RADIO if your listening PLEASE play this song, I want to hear more of The Artist's newer songs. He's truly a genius!"
4,Better than you realize,"Like most, I was expecting(hoping) for something that hit me between the eyes as a classic(When doves Cry, Sign O' the times). And in that respect, I was disappointed. But being a fan, I forced myself to listen again without the expectations, as most non-fans will hear the song. And what I heard was a beautiful melody, a chorus that implants itself in your head, subtle guitar underscoring the singing, and harmonies that send chills. Yeah, it's commercial, but it's far, far better than most of the bland stuff I'm hearing on the radio. And nobody out there could sing a song like this the way he can."
4,Get religion,"I really enjoyed Rocket Religion. The author has an acute eye for character and place that, combined with a disdain for genre, leads to a story that is involving and takes unexpected turns. And at the center of this story is Russell, an earnest and goofily likeable man whose desire to build rockets and be a part of humanity's journey into space is matched only by his desire to connect to the humans that surround him. It's hard not to root for him as he travels across the globe in pursuit of the stars, all the while struggling to make sense of soldiers, engineers, rockets and relationships.Especially impressive for a first novel, hopefully more to follow..."
5,"I'm sorry Visor, I just don't have time for you anymore....","Don't get me wrong, I love you, my blue Handspring Visor, but, I'm sorry honey, my new toy has a screen 3x the size of yours (480*160), with 16 grayscales, and unbelievable sharpness. Yes, I enjoyed all the good times we had, spending time learning Graffiti and taking 10 minutes just to scratch out a quick note, but my Mako has an actual QWERTY keyboard that I can use to type out the same message in seconds. She has double your memory (16MB) and all her built in apps in another 8MB of ROM, and an OS known for its flexibility and stability, and a processor twice as fast as yours (36MHZ). I'm sorry honey, really I am. Maybe if you had only had built-in versions of Word and Excel, and a rechargeable battery, it might have worked out between us, but I have to move on."
5,Exceptional product / value,"After thorough review of similar products, the Mako was by far, the best product for the money. It has an interface, that anyone remotely familiar with a PC would be comfortable with. It accomplishes things that the other devices would require additional software or hardware to accomplish. I highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for an extremely functional PDA / Palmtop."
3,What about the battery?,"I agree with all the features what the others are saying. I agree with the drowbacks as well. What disturbed me the most is the battery is not replaceable and the voltage monitoring circuit is not very strong eather.I went to Europe for four weeks and recharged the battery using voltage converter recomended for turists. The chager died and my Mako doesn't work since. You can send it back for a flat repair rate of US$100 plus shipping.This is a nice little machine until you have battery problem. It can happen in one year or later, but no battery lasts forever."
3,Quantity or Quality?,"I compared the Mako to the Revo (the equivalent PDA with 1/2 the memory). The two machines were identical except for the memory (Mako 16 MB, Revo 8MB) so if that is the most important factor, the Mako may be the best choice. For me, the quality of the Revo was better and noticable enough so that I had to go with the Revo. The Revo was studier, the speakers louder and the screen a bit crisper. The Revo is made in Taiwan while the Mako is made in China. Other than that, everything else was the same. These minute differences may not matter if you are trying to decide between let's say a Palm and the Mako but if you are like me and had to choose between the Mako and Revo, I recommend the Revo."
4,This is my first PDA/Organizer,"I purchased this about 4 months ago and it really is easy to use especially if you are familiar with Microsoft Word and Excel. I use it to copy files from my PC that I want to have handy. The only thing I wish it had is a backlight. But that hasn't come into play too often. I usually have to charge it every 2 or 3 days. I recommend this product if you are not worried about having a lot accessories to go with it, because they are not that many available."
2,"I LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC, BUT . . . .","Nothing outstanding. I'm sure the band is great in person, and the CD cover images are really great, but the music didn't really trip my trigger. It's that Django/Hot Club period music, nothing too spectacular. I selected this particular CD of theirs because it had the least number of standards (such as ""Nuages"") and the least number of catchy cover songs (like movie themes). I thought it might be the one to help me determine how good the band's chops are. If you are planning on trying them out, go for one of their discs with the cover songs on it, so if you aren't impressed with the CD, at least you'll have a different version of a familiar song."
2,Review of Georgia's Eyes,"While there was some new and interesting information in the book about O'Keeffe, I really did not like the illustrations. I thought they were not in keeping (AT ALL) with her work. Also, many important things about her work were not even mentioned."
3,great to see old loudness reunited...........,"after 1988 the latest EP ""jealousy"" of niihara era loudness. we have no chance to see all of them four old nippon rocker on the stage. although they only play five of ten songs of cozy."
4,Nice CD,"this is probably choclairs best cd so far. he did great on ice cold, screwed up on memoirs of blake savage (cept for skunk, love 'em all and light it up which was good). it has nice song like till now with the Circle, all i need, thought train, tell em, and hot this year. he has new thoughts with this album and got rid of the infamous line, face down ass up. he has killer beats with saukrates producing and parts of the circle do little parts in each song (which is sweet), and also has adlibs and big sox from Big Black Lincoln. great cd u should buy it."
2,Realize that these are light-weight (cheap) screens,"I intentionally ordered bargain screens for some rarely used fireplaces. They're OK, but realize that they really are very light weight and cheaply made. Joints had come unscrewed and were in pieces right out of the box. Easily fixable, but... They'll probably serve the purpose, just a little disappointing."
1,Horrible Quality,"This thing falls apart right out of the box. It came slightly rusted, and any handling of the product whatsoever makes it fall apart further. I can't believe I paid for this. I'm taking it home today, and if it doesn't stay up, I'm returning it."
2,"cheap, cheap","I just got this fireplace screen and was disappointed immediately. It had fallen apart before I even opened the box. It was not easily put together...took a lot of work with the screws, caps, etc. to get it together (they kept falling off). Overall, I like the design, but the mesh screen is chintzy, and the entire frame is light weight & CHEAP. Not very sturdy.I didn't expect top quality for $32, but couldn't believe it was made as cheaply as it is. I plan to send it back and look for a better quality item. I don't recommend spending your money on this one...unless you need cheap and lightweight. Too bad, I do like the simple lines/design...hence the 2 stars."
1,not the right region,This was listed as a region 1 dvd but it was a region 2 Double check before you buy
5,Excellent introduction,"While you do need to know your time of birth to get the most out of this kit, if you plan to get the most out of any astrological reading you need your time and place of birth to determine the exact location of the planets. That said, this kit is wonderfully detailed, but also very simple to use. My friends and I had hours of fun casting our horoscope and then reading our personality traits out loud to see if they fit us. A great introduction to the complexities of astrology."
1,missing pieces,"I can't review this item because I got mine and it was missing everything but the book. Can't do anything with just that, so be carefu buying used stuff."
2,"Okay at first, but died pretty quickly...","My parents ordered me these new speakers when they got me a new monitor. For awhile, they did work fine, and the sound quality was great. However, the other day, they randomly died on me after about 3 months' use. I'm stuck trying to find another relatively inexpensive set of speakers (while still giving the audio quality I'm looking for)."
4,Great Little Speakers for Music,"I like to listen to internet radio and CDs while I work. Not listening too loudly, though I have been known to turn it up for the occasional song now and then. For my use and for the price, these are great speakers: not tinny, decent bass."
4,Good for a first book,This one is pretty good. It isn't the BEST romance I ever read but it's probably one of the best I read this year. The hero is great and the heroine is nice but she sometimes does dumb things a little too often. It's funny even when she does so I guess that's a pretty good sign. The kids are the best. If you like kids in books (I don't usually but this writer did it a lot better than usual) you will probably really like this one.
4,Great book. Lose a star for how it was marketed,"I purchased this book to help explain extreme weather to my 3 year old. My daughter is advanced for her age, usually doing well with books ages 4-6. This book was targeted towards that on the searches. This book is fantastic in and of itself, it's just for a child perhaps 6 (MAYBE)-11."
5,Perfect Solution,"This crate provided a perfect solution for our neurotic maltapoo. She has separation anxiety and prefers to be crated when we leave her. But we didn't want an ugly crate sitting around. This crate is not only more attractive than standard wire crates, but since it's on wheels, we can easily move it out of sight when we're not using it. I also really like how easy it is to open and the fact that the top opens as well as the side door. Overall a very nice and well-made product."
3,If you have trouble with math; avoid this book.,"While I haven't finished the book as of yet; I can say the following...the book has a lot of somewhat complex formulas, essentially, it's econometrics for fantasy football. If you don't know what econometrics is, I won't explain it here, suffice to say that it uses a lot of math formulas to attain players values.The writer's theory behind all these formulas is interesting, and may be useful in attaining values for established players in the NFL played for a few years. It does lack however in acertaining values of rookies and players who have yet to emerge (sleepers). Again, I haven't finished the book as of yet so he may address these topics in a later chapter. Again, if you don't think doing math as a recreation is fun, then avoid the book."
5,What a Great Book,"Both my kids, age 4 and 2, love this book. Something about seeing the little bunny making a mess just cracks them up. I find the book fun to read as well; the author and illustrator have really captured the spirit of a toddler and it makes me smile to see so much of my kids in the character."
5,Backstreet Boys voices are the best,"This CD is great, if you are a big fan of the Backstreet Boys you should buy this, you can hear his wonderfull voices everytime that you want."
2,beast,"Remember that story in ""Trilogy of Terror"" where Karen Black was chased around for 15 minutes by a spear-wielding 1 foot tall native jungle monster-man doll with sharp teeth? Well, if you liked that scene, then you may love this movie, which features an entire island full of hundreds of little buggers that seem to be close cousins to said jungle mo'fo'.This low-budget period piece film tells the story of a group of people surviving a luxury liner shipwreck only to be stranded on an island full of the horrible aforementioned ""beast creatures""! Most of the running time consists of the survivors being gradually picked-off as they fend for their lives from an onslaught of tiny terror attacks! You will either find this film somewhat creepy or ridiculously hilarious depending on your outlook of such things!"
1,Crap,"I must say, This is by far the worst tab book I have ever purchased. On top of NOT including the solos, it is very unclear how to play the songs. I have even found a one mistake in the book, and I have only had it one day. I am the biggest Metallica fan you'll ever find, and I am a decent guitarist. This is a horrible book. I have found that all Cherry Lane Music books are disgusting quality. I would definitely recomend you pitch in the extra 3 or 4 dollars and get the other Kill Em All tab book. I can surely say that the other tab book can not remotely be as sh*ty as this. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
4,One problem...,"The collection is great except that the product description indicates that Five Great Stories by Chekov is included, but it's not. Instead a volume of The Cherry Orchard is."
5,Thumbs up...HIGH UP!,"This track ""Bad Karma""...DA BOMB!!! The production is top notch! There are so many hooks in this song, with it`s pulse cuting rythme, it`s a definate hit...Everyone watch out for this guy, i`m not just saying this...i have no idea who the hell he is...and this stuff is excellent...if i could i would give it a 10. Major record labels, are you listening? This guy is gold, nobody knows it though. Thanks for the awesome music Blake"
5,great product,this is a well constructed product. Just as the company described and very easy to put together.
2,Description needs to be written differently,"Maybe it is just me, but when I purchased this item, I thought I was getting everything I needed. It was only after I purchased that I read customer reviews (I should have read it first) and realized I had to go buy and cut the wood. I did finish it and it is quite nice. So, I guess the description deserves the 2 stars, but the finished product and ease of construction gets 4 stars. It took me quite a while to get it put together...I had trouble getting the screws in straight."
1,Scanner,Has never worked properly. Even sat through a tutorial given by the manufactuer and has never read a single bar code.
4,Item was great....I sure paid too much for shipping though,I loved the item and it arrived quickly but shipping cost was outrageous. I will make sure I pay attention to that in the future.
4,Seems to work just fine with the exception of the little cloud cartoon,"Cartoon of clouds doesn't change, but husband is a weather nut so he loves this thing."
4,"A nice, easy to use weather forecasting station","The Honeywell TE529ELW is a reasonably priced, easy to use, basic weather forecasting station with multi-channel receiver capability. The unit ships with one base station one and transmitter with a good remote range of up to 30 yards. The station, once set-up, provides clear and easy to read information. Particularly useful for our family is the temperature trend and forecast functions; we use these each morning to help plan our day. Please note the atomic clock functionality will not register your time zone; you'll need to manually set the time zone. If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive and user friendly model chances are this is the one you're looking for."
1,Unfortunately not worth reading,"For beginners, souhami's textbook isn't what you are looking for. The link between the basic medical science and the clinical aspects is not adaquate enough for beginning medical students."
3,Forget it unless you're a serious getten fan,"Well, the TV series only has 3 songs, the opening, ending and the insert song on the second last episode (Makenaide). What this CD has is Shining Moon (a song that's never been heard of in the series) and 4 extra soundtracks along with the karaoke version of Shining Moon, that once again hasn't been heard of before in the series. The song's nice and the soundtracks are good (makes me wonder why they didn't include it in the series), but take note that NONE of these have been played in the series (unlike what the review before this one claims).If you're after the opening or ending themes, go get the Singles. If you're after Makenaide, go get the Animation Soundtrack (which has most of the BGM tracks that HAVE been played in the series)."
3,Freeze Frame,Tried it for 2 weeks - no signifcant improvement apparent yet. Pot a lot smaller than anticpated and not filled with product.
2,Not much haiku for a haiku book,"As someone who greatly appreciates haiku, I was greatly disappointed by this book. I wanted a book with nothing but haiku. This book is mostly writing ABOUT haiku. It has precsious little haiku verses. And for the ones that were in the book, there were pages and pages of comment on it. If one wants to read a book about what people think of haiku and how they understand it, this book may be for you. But, if you are interested in having a book with the vast majority of what is actually in the book being haiku, this will be a disappointment to you. A few minutes after it was downloaded to my Kindle, I deleted it--a waste of $9.69."
5,This is a true masterpiece of children's books,This was the first book I read in Farsi many years ago. I really enjoyed it at the age of 10 and I still enjoy reading it at 30.Behrangi gave children hope with his writings.His other stories are also delightful. I'm sure you and the kids are going to love it !
3,Finally,"Neal Armstrong is a national hero, brave beyond compare and worthy of all the lifetime accolades he's received... save one. He has never been generous with the experiences that cost the nation over 25 billion Dollars. Even in this book it's a small part; this book is primarily a biography, not an account of the lunar landing.I'm sorry, I just have a really hard time thinking well of this man. In my opinion it's not right to treat these accounts as belonging solely to him when we paid such a high price in Dollars... and others paid for with their lives."
1,"Neil Armstrong, A Good Man","Neil, A Good Man. Too bad he didn't land or walk on the moon.He was presented with a Deal he couldn't refuse. He didn't wantto end up like Grissom, White and Chaffee. So, he went along withthe program.Too bad this book is a book of fiction. No way there was a moon landingwhere men walked on the moon. Too bad James R. Hansen can't stand someonesaying something negative about his book."
4,"Armstrong well portrayed in ""First Man""","Yes, other reviewers have highlighted the somewhat pedantic narration, however, this is about Neil Armstrong and not Buck Rogers. The book did an excellent job of capturing the analytical professionalism with which Armstrong approached the space program. To bystanders like us, it was a thrilling adventure. To the astronauts, it was the ultimate technical challenge to their flying careers.The book does get bogged down with the details of Armstrong's flying career, but I can see that as the price of his cooperation with the book. The book makes clear that Armstrong did not regard his astronautical work as anything more (or less) than a natural extension of his work in aviation.Neil Armstrong is not a naturally colorful character, but through the book his engineering competence and his pride in his professionalism come through helping us understand the man who will always be ""first."""
2,Extremely difficult read,"I was very disappointed in the book First Man. Mr. Hansen is apparently writing to an audience which includes only pilots, engineers, or other astronauts. I found it an exceptionally difficult read, filled with pages of inane (to the lay reader) information about formulation and testing of numerous aircraft. I purchased the book in order to read a biography about a great American hero; instead, I got an in-depth lesson on engineering, flight, robotics, etc. My advice? Forget about this book if you are interested in learning about Neil Armstrong the man."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"How could such a potentially fascinating person have such a boring biography? No, I didn't read it through - I COULDN'T. I simply went to the index, looked up things that seemed interesting, and read those sections.Otherwise, the book is mostly a tedious bore and a major disappointment. It's easy to understand why it wasn't a runaway bestseller."
2,Unfair and not just this CD version,"When writing a terrific book like this one, authors please note how UNFAIR it is allow an ABRIDGED version to be recorded onto a CD. My husband is the biggest fan of space travel. He has read everything accessible to him. This CD is abridged and it is not fair that just because he is blind he can't hear the full version of FIRST MAN. I understand that digital downloads (sometimes) right this wrong, but in this case, the digital downloads available are not compatible with the readers (note plural) my husband has. Both the Kindle and the Nook are inaccessible to blind readers. Please, let's put unabridged version only on CD."
4,Neil was right - EVERYBODY else was wrong.,"While I did enjoy the biography and more specifically the subject matter - I thought the author went a little overboard with what everyone else did wrong and ""Neil"" did right. The author obviously had it out for Chuck Yeager! Too much time spent on a variety of topics such as the subject of who took what pictures on the moon! I did use this book to launch / read several other books on the same era - such as a biography of Deke Slayton and Michael Collins. I wanted to get their slant on the same topics! Enjoy the book but don't take it as the only source! js"
4,A very detailed history od Neil Armstrong,"The life history of Neil Armstrong is much too detailed to be readible in a few evenings. I had to skip pages where to many names and details showed up, not relevant to describe the unusual personality of Neil Armstrong.He certainly was the right person to be the first man on the moon.He did not take advantage of his celebrity status and stayed humble and modest in all his actions after the historic flight. The author did a dilligent and thorough job. He should come out with a shorter edition for the younger generation."
2,One huge disappointment for man... one giant mess for reader kind...,"I have read article after article on Neil A. Armstrong. I have read snippets in the biographies of many other astronauts and NASA administrators. I've read news stories and seen so many documentaries that I could probably tell the story of his NASA experience better than Neil himself. This story lacked anything resembling excitement. It failed from the first page to be interesting and couldn't even interest me when talking about his great accomplishment of landing on the moon. There was no conflict. There was no interaction. There was no impressions of Neil as it relates to his fellow astronauts. There were no pieces to the puzzle of a man who remains just as mysterious on the last page as he was before the book is ever opened. Sadly, this author accomplishes only one thing... Taking an interesting character from history and making him seem about as exciting as watching paint dry."
5,An excellent starting point. ...,"This book is excellent for a deeper introductory look at mathematicalfinance. It is well-written, and strikes a nice balancebetween sophistication and accessiblity. Its companion volume onC++ development in the context of quantitative finance is also wellworth examining. I look forward to seeing the follow up volume, whichwill cover additional, more advanced topics."
3,If you already know the field,"If you already know almost everything it is a very good book. No error and the guy knows what he is doing. However, if you know everything, why do you want to buy this book?Unfortunately, if you do not know everything, the book is very difficult to understand. At a first lecture I never get the point. After reading some others books and implement the problem, I can indeed understand the chapter... but what is the use? Maybe we (the author and me) do not have the same way of thinking...Another bad point is that there is no implementation. So if you are blocked somewhere you are dead.Moreover the authors spend 16 chapter of 18 on equities and 2 on interest rate. But this last field correspond to 90% of the market! ...Well,..., However,... not so bad ... so, 3 stars"
3,I didn't like the book,"I didn't like this book because I thought it was vague and because I was expecting it to read like a textbook. I am giving it 3 stars anyway because the first chapter was interesting. I haven't read other finmath books except for ""Handbook of Mortgage Backed Securities"" which I liked a lot, so this is how I arrived at my conclusion."
3,"Big size, Little storage","I have the large lensed Sony F505 camera - equal in size to the F707. Great camera but difficult to find a case that fits. So I finally purchased the ""official"" Sony leather case. Now I have a case that fits the camera perfectly but has no storage space for the battery(ies), or the charger and cord. There is also only enough room for one or two individual Memory Sticks. And I generally keep those in the ""genuine"" Sony Memory Stick Vault, which holds ten at a time.So, there's a distinct trade off. Find a case that has plenty of room for accessories but little room for the actual camera. Or buy the Sony case which fits like a glove but has just a tiny bit of storage for the extras."
4,Just As Described,"I gave it a four cause it's not quite as big as I'd like it to be, but it's durable, water/stain resistant, and cute!"
4,Fits well enough at a great price.,Easy to install on my planer. Initially there was a bit of a gap along the bottom edge between the planer and the plastic collector but a 10lb dumbell has taken care of that. I will use silcone sealant and see if that works.
3,"Work well, with reservations","This dust collector accessory worked well for me . . . no complaints about performance . . . and shipping was very timely - however, one of the three knobs/screws that are used to attach the accessory to the planer would not reach its mating thread - it was too short (or the plastic on the flange of the dust collector accessory was too thick). I ended up using it with only two of the three screws, which worked fine, but was not the most secure way to attach it."
4,Excellent for someone with no Visual C++ knowledge.,"I picked up the book, because I had the Visual C++ program from my workplace. I have had no prior experience with Visual C++. This book, quite literally, walks the reader through the basic programming tools of Visual C++. I look forward to trying out all the examples in the book. A definate must have for those with little or no Visual C++ background. (Works best if you have the Visual C++ program while you read the book.)"
2,"Money, paper and time wasting ...","I don't know how is it possible to put a 200 pages material in a book that counts more than 1200 pages, but people from a Sybex did it :( Plus, one of the worst thing that author could do is to print complete listings that VC++ generates and really BIG screen dumps...One of the worst books about Visual C++ :(((("
2,"Been there , Done that",If I listen to DJ Tiesto's Summerbreeze and Trance Nation 4 (Mixed by Corsten) almost al of the songs of the Corsten part of this cd are in it. Jesus! I dont pay for a CD to hear more of the same.. Ferry can do much better than this. The Smit part is good though (although he too uses some songs which are used by everyone)
2,Huh? The CD's over? Best nap I ever took.,"Ferry, Ferry, Ferry. WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? I can't believe that you mixed half of this crap. Frist off besides being boring, this complation is the same trance cd with the same songs that everyone else is putting out. With the likes of a genious such as Ferry Corsten, I expected something more. There are only a handful of songs that redeemed this cd. I'm not saying that the songs on it are bad, but rather old and played out. If I have to hear Bt's Dreaming on one more CD this year, I'm gonna shoot myself! If you truly like your trance to make you get up and dance, check Ferry's earlier work on the MOS series or check out any of the Euphoria cd's or Dj Tiesto. If you have a hard time going to sleep, this is the cd for you."
4,Simple and cost effective,"Macally's charger is a simple solution for charging your iPod while in the car (or on airplanes equipped with a PowerPort). You will need a Firewire cable to connect the iPod to the charger! This is important as 4G iPods do not ship with this cable. If you have the cable, this is a five-star product that does exactly what it says. It has a cool blue light that shines while it is charging--and reminding you that you are hooked up. It will fully charge an iPod in just a few hours.If you are thinking about a more elaborate car set-up for your iPod there are options that combine a FM transmitter, a cradle, and a power adapter that would make this device unneeded.Bottom line: four stars for function and design."
1,Inexpensive Because it's CHEAP - Broken After 3 Weeks,"After a few weeks of happily resting seated in it's plug, the spring loaded sides that keep it firmly in place gave out. Now it just pops out of the cigarette lighter hole. Spend a little extra and buy brand name with warranty."
3,Strong character,"I always enjoyed Dark tranquility, and Character leaves no doubt about the quality of this band...its quite strong, it as soul, strength and...character. In my opinion, Dark tranquility have reached a level of status in the death metal scene that only a few other bands have reached...Character, not their best work, but still, good and worthy to listen."
5,excellent reading,"This book allows the reader to trail along the astronauts & their instructors during training, and it also lets the reader get to know the people involved. It's a wonderful adventure with the crew of 41G!"
5,"Simple techniques, beautiful results","In the ""Celtic Knotwork Handbook"" Sheila Sturrock invites the beginner into the adventure of designing and constructing beautiful Celtic knotwork patterns. Don't be fooled by the simple techniques explained in the book. By first teaching how to plot basic patterns on a graph paper, she teaches the student the basic patterns and designs. From these basic beginnings the student then learns how to leverage those skills to create larger more complex patterns.In a matter of about an hour I was able to design and draw basic patterns easily. By the next day I could design and produce much more complex patterns and was quite pleased with the results. An enjoyable book that teaches one of the easiest methods to learn and create Celtic knotwork, it is a valuable reference as well as just plain fun."
3,I guess they're cutting publishing costs.,"I went to the store a few days ago to take a look at this book before I decided to buy it. When I found it I was a bit dissappointed in what I saw. It looks like the same book she made in 1998. It even uses the exact same cover only this time it is brown. Don't get me wrong, that is a great book and I use it all the time, but this book was about 2 inches X 2 inches smaller. I personally prefer the larger version which is 7 1/4 inches by 9 3/4 inches. If you don't mind the smaller size, it has been a wonderful reference. I also love how they illustrate both the two-dimensional line drawing and the final three-dimensional drawing side by side."
4,Celtic Knotwork Handbook,"This book is an interesting beginning for those just starting out in celtic artwork. At first, the lack of detailed instructions is confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it is very simple. This book shows an interesting way of doing complicated knotwork."
2,Great book if you want to create Celtic designs,"Unfortunately, I was looking for different project ideas, and not looking to learn how to design Celtic knotwork. So I returned this book and kept Celtic Quilts: A New Look for Ancient Designs (That Patchwork Place) which was perfect for my needs."
2,A Medium Effort,"I didn't much like the writing style and the central character which was booze. The secondary cast seems to go into liver shock if they are deprived of alcohol for a few hours. I am aware that the narrator is an alcoholic but his regeneration is still fueled by alcohol. I found the people in the book depressing, one of them a rabid overachiever and all of them generally unsympathetic. The book has a grey mist over it which never really lifts.Maybe the whole world of journalism is driven only by over imbibing, but that doesn't make it mysterious or interesting. That theme is overdone in this book. I found it mainly boring, even though I seem to be in a minority here."
3,Same book different cover!,"""Fatal Dead Lines"" and ""Death Notice"" are the same books, only the titles are changed. Fatal Dead Lines does have a Table of Contents that Death Notice does not have.I purchased both books. How do I get my money back?I previewed Fatal Dead Lines and liked it. So, I purchased it and when I finished I ordered Death Notice w/out the preview.Same book different cover!!!!!!!!"
2,Yellow #5,"I wouldn't have purchased this item had I known it contained this artificial coloring ingredient. With that said, the flavor is excellent and the spiciness is very strong. I would love this sauce, if the makers would stick with natural ingredients."
5,My favorite hot sauce,"This is the best Hot Sauce that I have EVER had. It is also quite the spiciest, so you only need a little bit. It was given to me as a gift, and I just love it. This is a sauce for true hot sauce lovers that desire a wonderful blend of hot spices."
5,Best Hot Sauce in the World,"I first tried Baron's West Indian Hot Sauce on my honeymoon in St. Lucia. It added so much to my dining pleasure that I brought back a few bottles in my suitcase. The scotch bonnet is a type of habenero. What is unique about it is that it has a very fruity flavor along with the heat, and the mustard adds complexity. The combination of fruit, heat, and spice is truly extraordinary. I like it on fish, chicken, burgers, steaks, turkey sandwiches, egg sandwiches, french fries, and fruit, yes! Fruit! If you want to completely blow your mind, try it on a wedge of drippy ripe mango. It it is dynomite with omlettes and any egg dish at breakfast, no better way to start the day. Just be careful who and where you kiss after eating this hot sauce. I have also tried Glady's of St. Thomas, which is also excellent, I am a big fan. Compared to Glady's I found that Baron's is more fruity, more consistant, and keeps better over long periods."
5,A joy to read..........,"The singular criterion of a ""good read"" is when you must keep turning the pages, to find out what happens next. In a memoir - always a very personal reflection -- this is a large achievement. Written with much humor the author displays a unique perceptiveness, enormous pluck, and also a poetic soul, in describing ten momentous years of her life while learning to farm in the Dordogne region of France and raise her four children. The animals encountered throughout receive the same love and attention as her family. Readers, both male and female, will enjoy an insider's view of the rural day-to-day life in a scenic and historic area of southwest France. This is a place known to many tourists yet unknown in its mores and manners, until now. I would highly recommend ""CastOff"" by Jan Murra to all readers, of all ages. December 2001"
3,Gundam W Operation V.4,"I confess, I bought this CD for the full-length version of Rhythm Emotion. And just as I though, that one track was well worth the price of this CD. All the character songs are also beginning to grow on me. However, I do wish they would have included some of the television BGM that didn't appear on Operations 1, 2, 3 and S."
1,Um..its ok,"I found this CD to lack good songs compared to the other gundam wing CDs. Although it has a few good songs like tracks 2,3 and 5, the other tracks seemed to be jsut put in there to make a full CD. I recomend buying thi sonly if you want to complete your gundam wing cd collection or are a die-hard fan."
2,This book is outdated...,"This book covers the older version of Mac OS X and is almost irrelevant in some cases to Mac OS X v2. Although it did help me out in some spots, there were a lot of things that I had to get from discussion boards to answer. At most, it is a run through of what to expect. But don't expect it to be anything like the new version of OS X server."
1,Awful!,"This book is so far off topic, its ridiculous. If you have been using OS X Server for some time and want a reference, don't look here. First they include a primer on how ethernet packets work. Then they never get to the point, unless you want to use NetBoot. It is a fairly good intro if you don't want to actually use OS X. There is nothing about NFS, Apache, basic ftp with a terminal, nothing. I can't say how much I am disappointed. With shipping, it was $40 - down the drain!"
1,not useful anymore,"While this book seemed very appealing for someone who is new to Mac OS X server and its Linux underpinnings, it is almost worthless at this point in time since it has not been updated to include the major changes that have been made in the past couple years. Save your money and visit online resources; they are much more valuable."
2,Good for complete beginners - Bad for anyone with experience,"A very light and fluffy book.3/4s of the book is filler. We don't need another book with a chapter on the OSI model, and certainly don't need this much detail on installation and configuration - it's not that hard. Most of the book illustrates and describes rather then explaining why. Certainly there is little attention paid OS X's UNIX roots (expecially OS X Server).The last few chapters are useful if you are heavily invested in using NetBoot or Mac Manager. But even in these chapters there more attention paid to screenshots and descriptions of all the checkboxes then any serious advice or advances discussion."
2,The Manual that never was,I've been waiting for something to provide some information on this amazing server. this wasn't it. Basically its a manual that should have shipped with the server itself. It doesn't provide the insight and detail that was needed for the one thing I wanted to do (utilize the 5 enet ports for load balancing) and most of it is elementary network info. Definitely NOT worth the [money] I paid for it and not worth the 4 mo. wait.
2,Incomplete,"The cover says it all ""An Essential Resource for the Mac OS System Administrator"". Absolutely no coverage for Windows clients using Mac OS X Server - a big omission in most computer installations today. Otherwise a good book to cover the basic concepts."
5,card captor sakura v.1,"tape was in exellent shape. could have been a little faster, but my 10 year old loved it anyway."
5,Can't Imagine Not Having the Battery Powered Engine,"Word to the wise ... use a new battery. The engine has a hard time pulling the coal car on the hills without a strong battery.My nephew loved playing with the train set. I purchased the figure 8 set, along with the bay bridge and some additional tracks ... and I still wanted more! He seemed to be thrilled with what he had.He even used his Lego cars to drive on the ground over the railroad tracks. I can't wait until Christmas so I can buy him some additional sets to connect to this one."
5,Wait a little,"My advice: Wait untill your child is familiar with the Manual controls, than get a battery-powered set/train.I'm pretty much HOOKED on Thomas! This is pretty cool if your bored with the do-it-yourself thing. I advice a strong battery. You can add expansion packs too. Overall 5 stars"
3,Good toy but not awesome,This is a nice toy. My biggest gripe with this toy is that the tracks not fit well on a carpeted floor. The track links also don't join perfectly but I am guessing that is to allow overall track to be of different shapes. Just seeing the train makes rounds and rounds gets boring after a while but making different shapes of tracks is definitely enjoyable.
3,personal message.,"I recieved one of my favorite childhood books ""Tommy at the Grocery Store"" and quickly opened it. Everything was fine in the book other than a personal message written inside. i dont know if it was written in the description when i bought it or not i did not pay that much attention i was just excited to find the book."
3,Another Person In My Shoes,"Although this book was not what I expected; I found it to be a great book for young people just starting to learn about their special gift- being a person with a congenital heart defect. I was actually born with a heart condition as well, and I found it interesting to hear another person's point of view on growing up with the challenges that heart patients go through. I found it interesting to hear someone else talk about their experiences before and after undergoing surgery. As I was growing up I always felt that I was the only one who had to go through with the things I had to; such as hospital stays, surgery, and a scar down the center of my chest. Reading Melissa's story made me realise that their are other special people who have gone though similar experiences."
1,More NT Trash,The entire book is useless. The concept behind the book is useless. The author obviously knows nothing about real computing. If you are in need of good reading check out The Unix Philosophy.
5,Satie plus Albéniz plus!,"This 3CD set is one that I play often, especially Cerdaña and Baigneuses au soleil.Sévérac's music is more virtuosic than Satie's, but is reminiscent of The Velvet Gentleman, nonetheless. Sévérac evokes the music of Languedoc, his home region in the South of France. He was a pianist, and he studied with Isaac Albéniz.Aldo Ciccolini is the perfect performer for this music. I have heard other performers, notably Jean-Jol Barbier. But none with current recordings can touch Ciccolini for Sévérac. There is a uniquely French lightness of touch and a Gallic nuance that are very pleasing.Sévérac also wrote songs. They are not profound or particularly original, but charming? -definitely.Deodat de Severac: Melodies et Chansons Vol. 1This CD features Michele Command and Gabriel Bacquier, and is well worth the horrific price."
1,NO STARS for OTT-LITE,"I received two OTT-LITE lamps (Key Largo and Hampton)directly from OTT-LITE. Right out of the box one of them did not work!! When I got in touch with Customer Service I found out that I HAD TO PAY THE FREIGHT CHARGE TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE LAMP!! I'm sending both back. When I asked why their return policy is not made clear up front, I was told it wasn't in their interest to dissuade customers when they ""rarely"" have these issues."
1,"Bulb: 10,000 hours; transformer: 250 hours","The bulb is rated for up to 10,000 hours, but the transformer only lasted about 250 hours. The transformer is part of the cord and is not replaceable. Ott-Lite won't respond to my e-mail inquiries and doesn't list transformers as a replacement part. I tried a variety of sources for an 18w. transformer that could be modified to accommodate the lamp, but the cheapest I could find was about $30.00. I bought a brand new Hampton Bay table lamp (similar to the Ott-Lite lamp) at Home Depot for $20.00. If your Ott-Lite ceases to work you'll probably assume that the bulb must be replaced and spend $15.00 or so for a new bulb, only to discover that it's not a bulb problem. So you end up with a lamp that won't work and two bulbs you can't use on any other fixture. Don't buy Ott-Lite products...and exchange any Ott-Lite gifts you might receive."
1,Stay Away,"Years and years ago (probably before amazon.com was born) I bought this Ott Lite. It has been a great glare free, easy on the eyes, reading light. Finally the bulb burned out. So I've tried replacing it. The first replacement produced about as much light as a night light, not a reading light. The second replacement worked but lasted 13 months (I calculate much less than 1000 hours). My opinion, these lamps used to be good, but for now stay away."
1,Overpriced Junk,"As a crafter, scrapbooker, etc., I need good lighting, with a magnifying lens, so I paid the big bucks for the Ott Light Floor lamp with magnifier attached. Within a few months, the magnifying lens fell off. It had a screw-on attachment which was made of vinyl and could not hold up the weight of the lens. The vinyl threads are stripped, so I now have a lens lying on my work-table.I had only used the light a short time, and infrequently, when this happened.Recently, the lamp fell over (vacuum cleaner cord caught it) on a soft, carpeted surface and broke at the connection point. Now I have a lamp lying on the floor. I can't think of any purchase I have regretted more than this one - this is the most over-priced junk you need to stay away from!!!!"
1,Ott-lite was used and overpriced,The ott-lite I bought was supposed to be new but was obviously used before. These are expensive bulbs and I was not getting the quality of what I wanted from the company.
1,Ottlite - a Made in China piece of junk,"Bought an Ottlite desk lamp model N30NKA-CA thirteen months ago. Even though I hadn't used it very frequently it's now a defunct piece of scrap metal. The on-off switch bracket broke and the switch has disappeared into the inside of the base. OttLite's customer ""service"" department is about good as their lamps which is useless. DO NOT buy OttLite's junk products."
1,OTT LITE Broke . Poor Custermer relations,"My Husband, bought me an OTT LITE it fell apart , so I contact company in Tampa, and they say too bad , if you want replacement part it $6.95 + shipping! My husband paid $70 for this Chinese Junk, less than a year ago, I had it gently clamped to my quilting frame, the clamp just disindegrated, and they want to charge me $7 + shipping, when we already paid a USA made price, for a piece of Chinese Junk! It made in china, and shipped to company in Tampa.I got runaround for 2 weeks, when I called the company, I emailed pictures, they claim Engineer stated that the clamp was not defected. The Lamp sat for 4 months, not moved, and I found a piece of it , on the floor. It just broke apart! The rest of my overpriced ott lights are all getting returned , to store."
1,Ballast bad,I had an OTT lite die also so I'm not a big fan although they're pretty effective when they do work. I don't trust them unfortunately.
1,Bulb Eater,"I purchased an Ottlite Floor Lamp several years ago. Yhe light was for reading and worked fine. The problem is blown Bulbs. I have reached the point where I am looking for an adapter that will let me use a more standard Florescent bulb. If I can't find a way to change the socket, I'm afraid the lamp is heading for the scrap heap. I can't afford to keep replacing the bulbs."
1,Ott Lite floor standing 18Watt light,"My wife purchased this light to help with knitting and reading. After a couple years, the top cover over the lamp appears to have hardened and become brittle because of the warmth of the lamp. As a consequence, when you grasp the lamp to turn it on, you flex the top which apparently has finally cracked causing a piece to break off. This could cause a shock hazard.I contacted OttLite for a replacement top cover and they do not carry spares for that part. Hmm. I get to fix with duct tape or some other means.I don't think much of a company with inadequate spare parts for their lamps. No help there. Won't be buying another product from Ott Lite."
2,Lamp quit after 2 years,"I have an OttLite desk lamp at work. It quit working earlier this week, I thought it was the bulb but no replacement bulbs are working. I believe it is the transformer in the lamp itself. I liked the lamp while it worked but dying after 2 years of mild use it unacceptable."
2,Only slightly better than Bocelli's Verdi.,"Don't even bother reading the reviews, just download some of the sound clips of this recording. Cura's voice is so artificially created, that even a casual listener can tell that it's not natural. He already has a pronounced wobble, and only occasionally sings what's actually written. Phrases are almost always cut off prematurely, the sign of someone not in full control of his instrument. I can't speak for his acting abilities, as some others here have, because they don't matter here. What matters here is sound, and what's here isn't great."
3,Disappointing after his Puccini CD,"I was favorably impressed with Cura's debut recital of Puccini arias (recorded June 1997), and on the strength of that favorable impression I bought his Verismo arias CD (recorded July 1999) and his Verdi arias CD (recorded Feb. 2000). I found both disappointing; neither is up to the standard of the Puccini disc. What is alarming is that I believe there has been audible deterioration in his voice in the short period of only two and three years between recording the Puccini disc and recording the next two. He is singing heavy roles usually, and advisedly, taken on by tenors later in their careers (e.g., Samson, Otello), and I hope this promising tenor won't sing himself out prematurely.In addition, the Verdi arias CD gives poor measure for a full-priced disc, only 11 arias at 54 minutes timing (both the Puccini and Verismo CD's are over 70 minutes)."
1,Deliberate fraud,"If you have to watch this rubbish, check it out online or at the library, don't waste your money. The computer animation (cartoon) is bunk. Look where they put the back wound on their cartoon and then find the color photo of JFK's shirt at maryferrel.org--There's where the back wound was (over 5 down from the collar)and how could a bullet enter that far down on the man's back and exit his throat.ABC cuts Maclom Kildoff's press conference reply to a question where he answer's,""..It was a simple matter, Tom, of a bullet right through the head..."" But ABC cuts the film before Mr. Kildoff points to his right temple, indicating a shot from the front.Isn't it strange that there have been no documentries on the JFK assassination that expose the ""Single Bullet Fraud"" on any main-stream tv channels!?!? What are they afraid of? Buy ""The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History"" dvd instead.The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist HistoryThe Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History"
2,Too much slapstick not enough kung fu,"I was interested in these movies because I did'nt think that Gordon Liu could appear in two bombs in one package but I was wrong. These two films are strickly heavy into comedy with few fight scenes. But there is one positive to this package and that is the final combative scene between Gordon Lui and Lo Lei in Fist and Guts was pretty good, but the price for two movies is not worth one good fight."
5,Powerful Massager!,"I didn't purchase mine here at Amazon but will when this power horse wears out. This does the job wonderfully. Has two speeds ,the low one is powerful in it's own right' but the high does some serious work on relaxing those muscles etc. Great machine!"
5,Great Massager!!,Both my husband and I have some back and neck problems and I went on line to find a massager similar to the one our Chiropractor uses. I found this one on line and read the reviews and decided to place an order. I must say we are well pleased with the massager and think anyone looking for one would be too!!
5,Maxi rub,"I had bought my first Maxi Rub, the kind my chiropractor used and told me to get. It lasted for over 20 years. This one is lighter, and also has two speeds. It really helps to relieve pain and stiffness in my back."
3,Fair to Partly cloudy.,"My old one wore out so I had to purchase a new one. This Maxi-Rub is not as powerful as the older one, not even close."
4,Can't beat the price!,"Originally I had registered for Baby Einstein's Learning Seat and then the Kick and Play, both of which, are much more expensive than the Safari Bouncer. But after repeated trips to BRU I decided to register for this one as it was a lot cheaper and not so loud in color design. (Although, I know babies like primary colors I wanted something that would mesh well sitting on our living room floor.) Not only is it very cute but it is perfect for snoozing. It is the one item that I could not live with out (besides a boppy) when my son was born. He would fall asleep and stay asleep for hours at a time. Now that he is getting older I could see where a more expensive and more interactive bouncer might be useful but my little guy doesn't seem to mind. I hardly ever use the vibrate mode but the chair is designed so that you can use your foot to bounce the chair as fast or as softly as you see fit which has come in handy."
5,Great seat,"I have been very happy with this bouncer. It is a wonderful specially for newborns or smaller babies, because of the way is cradles the baby. Mine has been washed several times and is still in great shape, seems to be very durable. Doesn't have all the lights and sound effects, but who needs those anyway."
3,not so great,I wrote a good review about this chair when I first bought it. I wrote that our baby loves the mobile and the vibration. After 2 months of having this chair the mobile kept popping out of the slots and the heavy mirror that is attached hit our baby in the head leaving a mark. The vibrator started making this high pitched squeal after a while and we couldnt stand it when it was on. Also the blanket that is attached seems nice until it gets dragged on the floor and it picks up every bit of hair or dust on the floor. So then you don't want to put it on your baby because it is all full of lint. The one good thing about this chair is that it is alot deeper than most. Our baby stayed pretty snug in this as apposed to another chair that we had with a really straight stiff back. I think that with the next baby we have I will spend an extra 20 dollars and get a better chair
2,The Ocean Wonders Bouncer is much better,"I registered for this bouncer due to all the good reviews it received on here. I am a bit disappointed in it. I have 4 bouncers and this is my least favorite. The only thing I do like is it is comfortable for my son to sit in. The downfalls are:*The toys are attached by a small piece of velcro. Once I start bouncing him or he bounces himself, they fly off and hit him. Or they are always falling off and getting lost. They should be attached like the Linkadoos.* The blanket needs to be removeable. It's useless in the summer and just drags on the floor.*The mirror swings too close to him when he is lightly bouncedHe is so much happier in his Ocean Wonders bouncer I had to buy for him to have a bouncer at work."
5,We love it,"My wife and I no longer need to take turns holding the newborn while we eat dinner. With the baby in the bouncer, we can eat at the same time. It's effortless to bounce with a spare foot, too. The vibrate setting is just right, and doesn't burn through batteries either.I think the animals on the bar could be better, but they're fine. My wife thinks it could be easier to get him out of the seat, and that it's a little hard to move around without picking it up. (But: maybe that stability is a feature.) But these are minor concerns - we give it 5 stars."
4,The good and bad...,"The good: The baby likes it... while the vibration seems strong to me, the baby doesn't seem to mind. Good bouncy effect (better than a rocking effect, at least according to my daughter). Good price, cute fabric, washes easily in the washing machine.The bad: Hate the fact that the legs stick out. I and my toddler have stubbed toes and tripped over the legs on a number of occsions. Also, it's difficult to change the battery without removing the baby and a portion of the fabric from the seat (Ideally, I would prefer to change the battery without even taking the baby out of the seat.)"
2,Don't Buy This Bouncer!,"Although I fell in love with the adorable animal prints on the fabric of this bouncer, I would not recommend it to anyone because of the position of the seat. It is at such a steep angle that our son slides to the bottom of it even when strapped in. He can't stand to be in it. His feet have nothing to rest on and even I would find this uncomfortable. Our baby (now 11 weeks) has always been average in size for his age so we know its not him. Also we have put him in several other bouncers that our friends' own and he loves them all. All of them have gentle angles where the baby is slightly elevated. The only way he will stay in it is if we put 3 or 4 blankets down in the seat so he is more propped up and doesn't slip. Also the animals above on the bar are at such a wierd angle that he can't really enjoy them. I would NOT recommend this badly designed piece to anyone."
3,Poor Nancy,"Poor Nancy...mom gets pregnant and dad is apparently too macho to handle things in her absence. So she's pressed into service - has to learn to cook and clean.In spite of the uber-inequality present in this book, I find it a strangely good read. I actually pull it out now and then when I need inspiration for my spring cleaning. It's not only a fictional book; it includes actual cleaning instructions. Much of it is out of date - does anyone still sprinkle their clothes? - but nevertheless, if you want to learn how to make hospital corners, this is your book."
5,Taming Your Gremlin &#65533; Richard D. Carson,"A little book on a big topic, Taming Your Gremlin, by Richard Carson, is a practical guide to overcoming barriers to your success. The gremlin is used as a metaphor for that voice of doubt we so often encounter when facing a new challenge. Carson takes readers through the steps they can follow to pursue their dreams in spite of their fears.His formula of simply noticing, choosing and playing with options, and being in process, is reinforced throughout the book. Carson relates common scenarios encountered through his many years of counseling practice with his patients. The scenarios are oh so familiar!This book is a quick read on a topic that can change how you relate to the fears associated with taking risks. Each chapter builds on the earlier ones. In the end, the reader knows more about themselves and has tools to tame their voice of doubt."
2,Very disappointing,"I've been working in the personal and professional development arena for the past 7 years and this book has been recommended to me many times. I finally decided to read it because limiting beliefs are a common theme with many of my clients.I don't get it!It's not just that the gremlin metaphor gets taken to the extreme, it's that the promised method for ""getting out of my own way"" was nowhere to be found! When I finished the book, it felt as if there were a few chapters missing.Carson goes way too far in describing how to identify your gremlins and even visualize them but doesn't go into enough depth on moving past and eliminating them.I'd recommend this book only to someone who isn't sure what is holding them back and hasn't yet identified their limiting beliefs."
5,Excellent!!!!,One of the best books I have ever read. I think this is the kind of stuff we should be taught when we are very young.
2,Taming Your Gremlin,"This was not as innovative as I had hoped, but is cute. Nothing new to grab my attention."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I wish I would have listened to my gremlin before ordering this book. I thought the cover of the book was pretty neat and that it would prove to be an amusing interesting book based on that and the sample pages. My gremlin tried to warn me that it was probably going to be just another book I'd end up being sorry I bought, but I wouldn't listen to him! Well, it turns out he was right! The best and only thing about this book that I liked was the cute cover; it was all downhill from there. I give it two stars because it you can wade through the poor writing, and the gross examples he sometimes provides (like his teenage ... while looking up a cheerleader's skirt) then you might find some things that will help you; like deep breathing, mindfulness (living in the moment) etc. But there are plenty of better written books about these things and there is nothing new or dramatic in this book to make it worth the hype it gets by so many other reviewers here."
2,Stay out of the way,"I read this on a friend's suggestion. It was ok. Just a little too simple for me and the constant reference to the gremlin every few sentences was kind of irritating. I didn't like visualizing a persons gremlin as the same character all the time, never changing. I just don't believe that, I think it would evolve as we lived our lives and changed.I thought it was a little too simple and I didn't see any real research or fact that backed up the statements so I wasn't confident in the writer's claims. Add that to the fact that most of the subjects were male as were most of the gremlins. I didn't feel like the book was gender-neutral enough to help me. Maybe if I were a man it would have resonated more.It is however a simple read. It's not my style of book though I'm sure it is useful to some people."
2,Self Help Always Works -- (When You Do It Yourself and in your own way),"Self-help is the ONLY thing that works, but there's no substitute for finding your OWN path (not this or any author's) and pursuing it in your own way."
3,No Mention of Zen?,"If you think this book on how to control the dominating, socially-conditioned voices in your head might be useful, but want to find the real think search 'Zen', ""Buddhism' in the search bar. You are sure to find something more substantial for your money to 'get yourself out of the way""."
3,A little bit lightweight,"This book has some great insights into getting past your ego blocks and old personality limitations.The presentation is very light hearted and ""popular"" using cartoon style graphics that would be at home in a children's book.Nonetheless there are some real nuggets of insight into spiritual growth, even for a reasonably self aware person."
4,It worked for me,"I'm no expert but I really liked this book. The first chapter hit a home run for me. I wish I had read it 10 years ago. For me, the rest of the book was just okay...but who knows which part of the book will be helpful to you?"
4,Perfect replacement,I have a kettler ping pong table at work and only needed the net and not the posts but it fit perfectly. hard to find replacement pieces.
2,Stick with the clamp grip posts.,My advice is to stick with the clamp grip posts so they can be used on any table without any problems or having to make a home made adjustment just to make it fit.
1,"Caution, the post is plastic","The post is very weak. It's made of plastic. The picture and review rate are misleading. Don't buy, don't buy."
5,Easy on & off,"This net is perfect for those of us that don't have a permanent spot for the table. It is very easy to take on & off the table. No screws to turn. No clamps. The design keeps the net taut with a minimum of hardware. I have had my table for over ten years and am on my second net, which is pretty good durability."
3,Best I can find,"I love laptop keyboards (good ones, that is.) This is the closest and best I can find to a laptop-style flat keyboard for my desktop. It's nice and flat, with short key travel (but not too short.)The only problem is that the frame is perfectly rigid, and thus hard on the fingers. Many laptops have a slight flex to the whole surface... most people probably think it's a bad thing, but I find it cushions your finger pecks just enough to make it more comfortable to use. This doesn't have that flex, so sometimes my fingertips hurt after a long typing session. I wish I could just ""type lighter"", but when I try I find it hard and I'm not sure why... something about this keyboard just isn't conducive to that."
5,Excellent Basic Keyboard,"This keyboard comes highly recommended from someone who has broken his fair share.I was looking for a no-frills keyboard which will take constant use, has a decent tactile response and doesn't involve batteries or radios. This one fits the bill perfectly. In particular this one has a standard key layout without odd arrow key arrangements, and has only a small inobtrusive row of special function (mute, e-mail, www, etc) keys. I was a little nervous about how well the ""laptop style"" keys would hold but, but a few weeks of constant abuse haven't slowed this keyboard down at all. As usual, logitech knows what they're doing."
4,Good basic keyboard,I bought this to replace a broken Compaq keyboard and it is a very close match. This unit works great and it is small. Nothing fancy here just the essentials. If I had anything negative to say about it would be that the hot keys aren't programmable. They are evidently set by the device driver.
4,Good...But needs improvement,This is great keyboard. The keys are just wonderful. However there are just a few pros and cons:Pros:Good style of key.Vary sleek lookingHot buttons work with vistaWell pricedCons:A little bigger than what I expected.No whist restSharp Plastic make the keyboard look cheapNo volume control for the hot buttons.Overall a great keyboard. If your like me and hate typing on raised button keyboard then look no further. But if you feel have more money to spend go and key a wireless keyboard. But really this keyboard is really good!
3,"Excellent, But Not Good For Heavy Gamers","I purchased this keyboard less then three months ago. I am a heavy user, spending 15+ hours a day at my computer, both working and gaming. As a work keyboard, I have no complaints; it is a sleek, low profile, compact keyboard with good key feel. But as a heavy gamer, I have destroyed this keyboard. I have not only worn the letters off of five of the keys, but I also wore off the texture on those keys. In addition, while those keys still work, there action is a little different then the surrounding keys.I am not sure if I somehow exceeded the manufactures recommended usage for this keyboard, and I would hate to mislabel it as inferior, I just want to let people know that if key wear is a problem you have, then this is not the solution."
2,"This is an FYI, rather than a movie review","Although one of my favorites, Jacqueline Lovell, is listed as the star in this little romp, she is a ""2 minute cameo"" that was filmed in her home by husband, Edward Nyahay. Because I loved her so much in HIDEOUS I made an effort to check this out by contacting her.Forced to give it a rating, I gave it two stars simply because I resented being led to believe Lovell was a major part of this project. On the other hand, if 'walking dead' movies is your style, give it a go and let the rest of us know if it's worth the time and price."
2,We've heard this before...,"I guess we can thank Sarah Brightman for this deluge of pop-opera/classical crossover artists mixing sopranos, tenors, new age electronics with pop flourishes. But this just rates as a lame copy, as good a singer as Mr. Cura is. I've never heard of the female before, but she should really come up with her own gimmick."
3,Sort of . . .,"This can _only_ be mounted (attached) to the wall, contrary to what the Features say: ""Can be mounted on a ceiling, under a counter or on a wall"". It would be very difficult to attach it to a vertical surface and also flush against a fixed upper horizontal surface (e.g. against the ceiling or against the counter bottom) due to the close proximity of the upper mounting hole to the top of the rack. The distance between the top of a drill and the center of the drill bit is larger and will limit how close the rack can be mounted to the horizontal surface.That may be why the picture shows a non-fixed upper horizontal surface (shelf) that could be added after the rack is mounted to the wall.With that said, the unit is sturdy and clean looking. I'll be replacing the supplied wall anchors with more robust connectors. Three stars due to the anchors and misleading (to me at least) description."
5,Metal Glass Rack.,Very sturdy and looks better than wood racks. Easy to install and bought one for my brother as he like it so well..
2,not om yoga FAST YOGA !!!,i love yoga and am welling to try new styles of yoga I had borrow this DVD from a studio I was not happy - i guess I like to take my time with yoga and really feel everything ! I have done yoga only at the studio with a group and i wanted to take my practice home So I thought this DVD would help well it wasn't helpful they rushed everything it wasn't even POWER YOGA! They didn't let you enjoy the breathing or letting you stay in poses they had a like 3 ppl and the teacher and they went so fast! Also the meditation was NOT meditation it was this FAST 2min breathing and then they moved on!!! I wouldn't pay for this DVD
2,Not for beginners!,"There is way too much talking and detailed explanations. If you're looking for a quick yoga exercise, this DVD is not for you."
1,Horrible,"Just horrible, you don't get a good yoga practise every segment is so short that just when you start to warm up it is over."
5,Fascinating document of the 70's New York loft jazz scene,"This is fascinating 3CD document of the 1970's loft jazz scene in New York and a bargain. It's full of gripping, wild and swinging performances by all-stars of free jazz (Anthony Braxton, Sam Rivers, Henry Threadgill, Sunny Murray, Barry Altschul, Khan Jamal, Randy Weston, Dave Burrell, David Murray, Marion Brown, Oliver Lake, Andrew Cyrille, Julius Hemphill, Olu Dara, Roscoe Mitchell, Don Moye, Leo Smith and many others, including Stanley Crouch of all people). It is newly back in print, but who knows for how long...? If you are not up for the full 3CD set, a sampler can be purchased inexpensively (called Jazz Loft Sessions)."
4,"If you just want to enjoy a great read, here's your book.","At a time when book publishers are putting out way too many of the same things - international espionage, plucky heroines triumphing over romantic adversity, murder mysteries, deep dark intrigue, etc. - this book is a breath of fresh air.It simply tells a good story that needs no plot twists, no obfuscation, no red herrings. Its strengths are its characters, its setting, and its straightforward story, all of which draw you in from the beginning.I found myself looking forward during the day to getting back to the book in the evening, and I hated to see it end, and books that have that effect on me are few and far between! If Raleigh's got a sequel in the works, I'm ready for it."
2,Get what you pay for ...,"Cheap. It served a purpose, briefly. The batteries run down in about one hour and you have to remove the device to replace them. Buy a better one."
2,Not the Best,"Tried putting this on my truck and could not really get all the bubbles out and yeah it is removable, along with the Red Ram emblem too, paint transfered to my window.Not exactly what I expected."
2,Professional Guide's Manual,Unable to tell from the title whether this is the pamphlet or book by George L. Herter. If you are a fan of Mr. Herter's writing style then you will enjoy either. His descriptions of the products sold under the Herter name are boastful and exaggerated to the point of parody. If you are looking for equipment advice or outdoor/camping information either of these publications are biased and dated.
3,General use guidebook,"I have used this book several times since moving to Oregon four years ago and have been unpleasantly surprised on more than one occasion. Although it does provide a large scale review of hikes in the pacific northwest, it fails to give accurate and reliable directions. In locating trailheads, I have found the mileages listed to be off by more than a few miles. Additionally, I have found trail directions to be completely wrong. For example, in one Goat Rocks Wilderness Area hike, the book tells readers to ""take a left at the fork in the trail,"" when the correct direction was to take a right at the fork. The book is a good starting point for learning about beautiful areas worth exploring, but I would never rely on it for planning a hiking trip. If you do decide to use this book, ALWAYS consult a map before your hike."
1,NoShow,"Never got the book. I orders 3 things, got one. This is the first time I have ever had problems ordering from Amazon."
5,"Trusted source, and a bargain","Complete, accurate, comprehensive, and entertaining, to boot. Amazing inventory of trails for the money. Maps are only so-so, but functional. BTW: The review below is a joke: Most people would give up on an ""unreliable"" guidebook after about five hikes and skip the other 95."
4,Response to a Review,"This is not a review rather a response to the review written by a ""Reader"" from Canada dated Feb 2003. You mention that you believe that Sikhism is a sect of Hinduism, but you have been misled. Although originated in Northern India, in the current state of Punjab and part of Eastern Pakistan, in early 15th century, Sikhism is a separate organized religion from Hinduism and Islam. I advise that before you publicly humiliate yourself with your obvious lack of knowledge, and defame a book, you learn to educate yourself on this religion."
4,Caution...For Teachers only,"Well-done but...this book is only for teachers. Pick it up if you're a teacher (I can see how these pages are helpful in that they're easy to re-produce), but if you're more than ten years old and areinterested in learning about Sikhism I suggest you pick up The Sikhs (Patwant Singh)."
3,Below average,"If you're not a teacher, this book isn't worth the money. It's just a bunch of worksheets that are designed to be photocopied. Simple as that. Don't waste a dime on it if you're not a teacher. Plus I'm not so sure it's accurate. It treats the religion as if it were distinct from Hinduism when in fact I've read in several books that Sikhism is a sect of Hinduism. I even read this in an encyclopedia! That this wasn't mentioned in a book written for children is terribly scandalous. The people who put this book together should check their facts the next time they publish. Terribly scandalous!"
4,Good for new and old fans,"For anyone interested in the Washington Redskins, this is an excellent book.If you just became a fan of the Redskins during the Gibbs era or later, this book will do a great job in bringing you up to speed on the history of the team. The good times, the bad times, the great players like Baugh and Jurgensen, and the flops like Gary Beban are all portrayed.If you're a longtime fan like me, there are plenty of great pictures and anecdotes. There's the story that Sam Huff, not coach Otto Graham, called for the field goal team in the closing seconds of the 72-41 record-setting game in 1966 in an effort to embarrass his old team. Or the one where George Allen had his team scouring the field at Redskins Park having them stick Q-Tips into holes that they found. There are dozens of sidebars throught the book with such material."
5,EXQUISITE,"Another great from this fabulous pianist/composer! This album is elegant and nostalgic, delivered in grace and style that is all Bradley!"
5,Great!!!,It has such great pictures of the city's and states. I love looking at it! It's so cool!! Two thumbs WAY up!!!!!!!!
3,pretty good For a begginer!,if u r learning dont spend money in a pioneer just try up with Behringer till you get the enough skillsits not as good as the djm400 but its cheaper.
1,garden of the dead,"This movie was so bad...I had to laugh at my mistake of ordering it. Poor acting, background scenes, the whole movie was what my family refers to as a Class F(fluke) movie. The only good thing about my order was, the movie was received in excellent condition...probably because no one else had watched it! I can hardly believe zombies would be interested in the opposite sexfor any reason...the dead also were shot and killed...again.My recomendation for the serious zombie enthusiast would be ""Resident Evil"". If all you want is to spend money and get a laugh ""Garden of the Dead"", which was for me a waste of my time and money, will definitely be your best bet."
4,No color listed,There is no color listed for the contents of the can. I was going to buy some but how can I without knowing the color?
2,Just Ok Product,I does what it say's but I did not find it very useful and was somehwat hard to work with or try and shape.
2,Not for new ipod with video,"I Purchased this case for my ipod video. It doesn't stay closed very well and the hole for the headpone jack is on the top left of the ipod but it is in the top center of the case so you have to skew it off to the side just to have the headphones in. It works ok but it looks like crap because it isn't really designed for this particular ipod. Maybe it would work better for older models, I don't know."
4,"Darn good spatula; not, however, commercial grade","I paid about five bucks for this spatula, and for that, it is a super deal.I would call it heavy-duty home-market grade. It is not, however, commercial grade.The blade is nice and stout; the blade steel extends all the way through the handle.Most people will consider this the largest spatula they'd consider buying. Some will conclude the blade is too long. I would be sure to measure your favorite spatula and compare the dimensions. I plan to buy another one of these and cut about 2"" off the blade for use with smaller fry pans."
3,Very inexpensive BUT handle was loose upon arrival.,The price is certainly very nice and the metal portion is fine and the wood on the handle is fine it's just the riveting that leaves a little to be desired. The turner arrived and the handle was/is loose right out of the box! For 5 bucks its probably an good deal but not to me. If the handle was properly attached this would be a five star review.
5,perfect spatula for a cast iron skillet,This is the perfect spatula for a cast iron skillet. It is a true square at the end.. It is not rounded.
5,"Low price, sturdy product","After searching at several high end cooking stores, my son found this spatula online. It's quality was better than what we found in stores. He's only had it since Christmas, so I don't know about durability yet."
3,OK for the price,Loose rivets on handle. A little too flexible/flimsy blade causes too much flex in the handle area. I tightened the rivets in a press. I just bought these for the camper so they will work fine for that. I would not expect them to last long if I used them everyday.
3,It's just a spatula,"Not sure if it's really commercial grade, but it's pretty much what it's advertised to be. The handle is tight and it works. I ordered this specifically to use with my Lodge Pro Logic 12-Inch Square Griddle. It works as expected. Given it has a wooden handle, that means I'm NOT going to be putting it in the dishwasher. That should ensure the handle stays tight and does not get loose.I guess I could have given it 5 stars, but it's just a spatula!"
1,Light doesn't stay put,"This light looks nice but it doesn't stay put. This light moves horizontal and vertically while you are riding. Yes, I got it tight but it still moves around and you have to keep re-aligning it while riding."
1,Cheap plasticy looking and can't see the light 3 feet away,Buy this if u have money to spend on junk stuff that you are no going to use. I never knew halogen light was so dull. I dont believe personally that this has a halogen bulb.
4,Great costumes,"I love this collection. The colors are beautiful. I have other collections by Tom Tierney, but this one only has 9 costumes per gender. I noticed that some people say there is too much ""near nudity"", but it's nothing compared to what I see on the beach when people are in two piece bathing suits. So if you take your young child to a beach and don't mind them seeing people in bathing suits, then this collection will be just fine for young kids."
4,Beautiful,"Amazing, two dolls, a dozen or more plates of beautifully draw clothing, how can you go wrong? If you love egypt, this is the paperdoll book for you."
1,Rated M for Mature,"I can't believe no other reviewer has mentioned that the girl paperdoll is topless! In a couple of the costumes, she has nothing on top (sure it's covered by props, but not well) and since when do paperdolls have DD cups? I got this for my daughter for Christmas, but there's NO WAY I would ever let her play with this type of paperdoll. Is it too hard to actually make something that's appropriate for children? Definitely not G rated IMO!"
3,0,"There is a better Music single out available. Since Amazon doesn't have a track listing for this single, I got this single. It only has two tracks:Track 1: Music [Original Mix] 7:07Track 2: Music [Bostik Mix] 7:35They are both GREAT mixes, but you should either get the other single (ASIN B00009P57H) or get the full IMPORT album Rush, it's a great album and also has three Music remixes."
4,Heard him on the radio,"This author was on the George Noory Show last nite, and the things he said make sense. I'm not only buying a copy of the book for me, but one for my boss as well -- he's always complaining about losing at the casinos!"
2,Not Worth It!,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from the book, but I just couldn't stand it. The whole thing was examples of people winning money, and showing how some of them can ""sense"" where winning slot machines and such are! I wish it would've given more information on the psychological aspect on increasing your luck by how you luck, but it did not. I would not recommend to anyone!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I expected more about how to create luck, maybe why people feel lucky and how they obtain it, not read pages and pages about luck in the casinos. Nothing really helped me in this book. Explaining others' Gambling and lucky streaks did nothing to help me and in fact bored me. Absolutely no meat to this book. Since I don't gamble, I thought I would scream when more and more pages about gambling began. This book was not what I expected at all. Very disappointed."
5,Real Secrets Of Luck Revealed!,"This book delivered what it promised--real workable strategies for cultivating good fortune, especially in making money, related by truly lucky people. Whether you gamble in casinos, play the lottery,or invest in the stock market, this book tells how to use your intuition, your dreams, and coincidences to chart a path in life that increases your chances of being lucky. He also describes in depth the spiritual dimension of good fortune and how anyone can access it. This is an exciting book!"
5,"finally, an investigative reporter tackles a ""soft science""","This terrific book, entertaining and informative, is a welcome antidote to those, like me, who were frustrated by Malcolm Gladwell's seemingly ubiquitous ""Blink"". Anyone familiar with Randall Fitzgerald's previous detailing of government waste knows he casts an ""unblinking"" eye on his more mainstream targets, and will appreciate his examination of intuition (luck). What many refer to as ""soft"", Fitzgerald reveals to be simply scientific, and explains, chapter by chapter, not only the fascinating experiences of others, but provides a path for the open-minded to really change there lives in the ways that matter most. Highly recommended."
2,"Strange but, listenable",This is not what I expected. I thought this was an all out rock band and to my dismay I found noise. I can actually sit down and listen to this though. Another review mentioned Merzbow...I think they hit the nail on the head. It has a hint of Meat Beat Manifesto also. I think some of Mike Pattons work also is along this same route.
5,holy smokes,"these guys are great....this is a superb album....wolf eyes are one of the few acts in the fringe music scene that completely lack any pretentious bs that usually plagues the avant garde....they are cool dudes who are totally into what they do....there is intention and form to this music....and their understanding of their instruments and tasteful journeys into the psychedelic unknown are inspiring....also, their live shows are unbelievably moving....blow your own mind!!"
1,"Looking for Music, 'Cause this isn't.","This simply is not music...some want to define it as art, however, the BAND i'm sure states themselves as such. This is noise, plain and simple, and listening to noise is not listenting to music. A five year old bangs pots and pans together, cars squeel down the street, and that is not considered music, if sampled and put to a beat of some kind, a rhythm (or any other various MUSICAL terms), then music is made.Making something intentionally horrible does not make it art: It's for profit (somehow...)"
1,The worst band in history!!,"OK. I have to say something about this band because I was unfortunate enough to see these guys open for Sonic Youth. It was shockingly terrible. There was nothing that resembled a song, lyric or note for that matter. Just noise. This is the worst idea for a band ever. Don't waste your money."
4,different strokes for different folks,"the beauty of having endless genres to pick from in this explosion of 'easier access to recording music' participants, is that almost nothing is really new. Music anymore is just the combination of other influences changed and re-interpreted just a bit to equal something that usually reaches fewer people but, at the same time, it reaches them more. Personally i like having a wall of noise in my mind. Searing through the crap and making my thoughts bare. It induces visual imagery in the same way that 'swans' music has done for me in the past, only there's less to get lost in because each moment is like a painful jolt back away from relaxation and it gets to the point where you just numb yourself and it becomes this brain-static of sorts that at once entices and deflects appreciation. I however appreciate it, even though it may not dominate my ipod playlists it's still there whenever i need it."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"This doesn't deserve any stars. This is not music and should not pass for music. It's noise. Awful noise. I'm not just saying that - preview the songs on this page if you don't believe me. Actually, don't be bothered. If you can appreciate this, there is nothing else left in the world for you to appreciate, because you've gone through any and all musical tones from every living or abstract thing and have ended up at WOLF EYES. I'd love to meet you if you've bought this album and disagree with me - I'll come visit you in your room with your rubber walls and nice white jacket."
2,Dissapointment,We had same problem. Train won't make it up the hill unless you push it with your hand. Why do they sell a battery powered train for their wooden railway if it won't work on it???? I can't believe they haven't fixed this problem yet.Don't pay the extra money for the battery operated train.
2,"poor function, died after about 1 hour","This self powered train does not work very well on standard thomas train track. We have a glue-down set up with nearly perfect alignment of all track pieces, yet is still did not run very well (either getting stuck, or jumping the track on corners). Build quality is generally mediocre. Our unit died permanently after about 1 hour."
2,Breaks VERY easily,"I've gone through two of them, neither lasted more than a few hours. Extremely frustrating. Advertised as being able to 'roll' when not turned on (so kids can't play with it manually) but I fear that might be causing the breakdowns. Internal engine is not very durable, despite external die cast metal being pretty solid. Not sure if I will return or tear it apart to try and find out why they keep breaking."
2,Go with Brio instead!!,We used to own Thomas and Percy. One we had to return right after we bought it because it wouldn't even work for a minute. The other one broke within weeks. Every single person I know who owed one of them had the same thing happen to them. First the little screw that holds the top part doesn't work any more after a only a few battery changes which is really frustrating. Then the engine just stopped working all together. The button is not easy to push and release as well. Especially for children. Do your self and your little one a favor and get one of the Brio engines. They last for years! I just gave this one 2 stars because it does look very cute and it sure is strong and can pull a lot of cars. Too bad it's only fun for a short period of time.
4,Obey the warning,"This is a fun toy and my 2 and 6 year olds love it. However, there is a very hard to read warning on the underside of the train that says that hair may become tangled in wheels. They are not kidding! I had to cut that train out of my two year olds hair when he picked it up off the track and lifted it too close to his head. It happened in an instant! It was a bit traumatic for both of us. Fun toy, but can be dangerous."
5,Manual just didn't work,"We bought the track and a few trains for our 3-year-old son. I also read on the box that battery-powered Thomas can be manually pushed, and ours does not. It's very frustrating for a boy who likes to do things on his own! While I get a kick trying to see how many cars battery-running Thomas will pull, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong to make it easily push manually, or if we have a defect. Overall, the set is very fun."
1,Don't buy!,Motor worked for a total of 3 minutes. Not exaggerating! It derailed the whole time. Now I've got a 3 year old crying for his Thomas to work.
2,Won't last long with a 3 year old,"If you have a kid who likes to move the trains by hand, don't spend the extra money on this. I think it's probably a good product, just not for a 3 yr old."
3,not well designed,"we've had this thomas for about a year now. he looks great, and my son was so excited to get him, but his battery wears out, seriously, within an hour or two. he also derails incredibly easily because his front wheels don't rotate at all. He also has very little power, but that's not so horrible; just means he goes slow and can't carry alot."
3,Battery change is adult only,"This purchase was as described, fast shipped, great condition, My son acts out his favorite Thomas episodes with these and the rest of his trains. It look good and is constructed well. Changing the battery is a little cumbersome, but protects the motor and working ""bits"" petty well."
5,Great toy,"Item arrived just as expected. My little guy loves his wooden railway, and this engine can pull several cars around the track. He loves it!"
1,Didn't even last a week,"I was SO excited to give this to my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas, but it has been more of a pain than anything. We have gone through 2 batteries in 6 days with Thomas, he can't seem to make it uphill anymore, and the motor has officially given out. The interesting part is that Thomas was used the least of my sons battery powered trains (Thomas and James). The battery powered trains are pretty useless as push trains, as they are very heavy and make a noise like you are winding them up when they move forward. My son has the James battery powered train which still seems to be running fine (after 6 days), but I'm thinking about removing these and going back to push trains only, as he once had so much fun pushing his trains around for hours and now he just watches James go around the track with so much less involvement."
1,Unbelievable- In a Bad Way,"We bought this Thomas for our son who is a huge Thomas fan, and has a huge set up in his room. He has both the Thomas(this product, bought somewhere else) and the Percy model. The Thomas we had stopped working, and was a older model, so we bought this one to replace it. Our son was very upset when we had to retire his older Thomas, but we promised him a new one.We bought this product, and waited patiently to add it to our son's Thomas collection. When it came, we opened it right away, and were shocked when we were looking at the Percy instead of Thomas.We coulda/woulda/shoulda contacted the seller, but this ""Thomas"" product is already in our Tildsmen shed, since we opened the package with our son.With so many places to buy genuine Thomas gear, if you are paying the premium Thomas price, we expected a better product experience."
3,Always changing batteries,Been looking for this to go with IKEA set. It works fairly well on tracks but eats up battery quickly.
2,broken,"Not work after one month of using, although it was nice when it works. My daughter is disappointed. I will try to repair it."
3,A nice beginner toy for a 2 year old,It was a nice introductory toy for my 2 year old Grand son. Created long hours of concentration and imagination with the toy.
2,Switch broken after 3.5 months of use,"The toy is ok. The engine is low-speed high-torque. So it can run on wooden trails that are less than smooth. However, the switch was broken after 3.5 months of use. Engine is always on and swtich does not function. Return policy is within 1 month of purchase."
4,Like this Series,"These trains are extremely sturdy and well designed (they'll take a lickin' and keep on tickin'), but they're not very fast if that's what you're looking for. I think the speed they're designed for is more a function of track design (If they were much faster, they'd probably come off the curved tracks more frequently). The one thing I'd probably suggest to the designers apart from a little more speed is a sound element. The age of the children this is made for, well they want to interact and play with the trains, and they would love to hear the trains go ""Choo-choo"" or say ""Hi, I'm Thomas, here I goooooo..."" or some such simple thing. I'd like to think that such a design element is not technologically beyond these companies that make so much money off of us parents because these shows and characters are so well marketed."
2,we Love/Hate this Thomas,"We have a love/hate relationship with this Thomas the Train. It is by far one of my son's favorite toys, when it is working. I must say I am very thankful for a husband who is handy, as he has had to ""repair"" Thomas twice (beyond just changing the battery). Just a few weeks after we purchased this, one of the wires came loose inside, leaving Thomas completely inoperable. After a few hours of being in the ""workshop"" and not an easy repair, Thomas was once again working. Despite these hang-ups, my son LOVES to play with him and has had enough enjoyment that it almost makes it worth all of the trouble....IF you are super handy, have plenty of time, and can fix him every time he breaks."
2,Can't turn,"I bought this toy for my grandsons who adore Thomas. They had great fun with it at first; however, as soon as the track was laid, it became apparent that this ""wood railway"" toy could not navigate any but the widest of turns without running off the track. That's no fun after all."
2,Very slow moving,"We bought this to use on our ""Step2 Deluxe Canyon Road Train & Track"" and although it does fit on most parts of the track it is very slow. Real slow.It is made well and powerful though. My son uses it to push up to 9 hot wheel cars around the track.Just wish it was faster. He got bored with it after a day."
1,Power trains blow,I have now bought (3) Thomas battery powered trains and (2) of them have lasted about two weeks. Once you have to take the batteries out several times they stop working-poor product for the $20 price tag!!!!
2,"Almost Great, Until it Broke...","My son recieved this as a birthday gift 2 months ago. He LOVED it even though it didn't corner well on our Mellissa and Doug train track. He mostly let it run on the floor, not the track, so that wasn't that big of an issue. It did, however, break after one fall from counter height. My son let it drive off the kitchen counter and after only 2 short months it is officially broken. It can still be played with but because it is meant to be motor driven it doesn't work that well as a push-powered train. Overall I'm disappointed, a toy that only last 2 months just isn't worth it."
1,Disappointed !!!,"I bought this toy for my son who loves the ""Thomas"" toys. You need one battery to operate the train and it seems to work well - it can pull other cars quite weel and climb up and down the tracks. However, what I was not happy with was the advertizing on the box - which clearly stated that the toy can be also be pushed manually by the child. THIS IS NOT TRUE (unless I had two faulty trains)!! My son likes to watch the train pull the cars on its own, but he also like to the the pushing himself. You are not able to do that with this train. It is just meant for watching."
3,Short battery life,"Was a little disappointed because this train didn't work on the track that we had. It also runs out of batteries very quickly, especially if left on (which is easily done by a young user!). Overall fun toy, but not worth what we paid for it, had higher expectations."
2,Does not work well,Having 2 young boys we have been into Thomas for quite some time over a 4 year span. This was about the 4th battery powered engine I have bought for them. The other ones have been durable and fun to play with and the batteries last for quite sometime.This one has a very sticky on button which is so tight my 4 year old can not even turn it on. Not much fun for him.
2,"2 days after I got it, it doesn't work!","My son had such a great time for the first day and then we had to change the battery the next day because it had drained very quickly.I had to keep explaining to my son, age 2, that it's not good to push it manually, because as everyone else complained I was worried about the clicking. We had decided maybe to take the engine away until he was a bit older and just let him have the track and the other non battery opperated car that came with it (mine was the Sir Topham Hatt set). But it was too late unfortunately and my son managed to break it. He pushed down on it to make it go manually and I think, bent the wheel, or the axel? Now it gets stuck and the back wheels stick and don't move with even the slightest pressure. I works but not as well.I think unless your child is old enough to just sit and watch the thing go round and round and keep the wheels clean, it's best to buy the non battery powered engines."
2,Ok. Battery screw problem,"We have Thomas, Percy and James battery powered trains. All of them have problem with the battery screws. From the first get go, I am unable to unscrew the battery compartment. I find a way to get it out only to use to tape to hold them together. It is a pain. But, my son loves it thought."
4,Battery powered Thomas the train,The train is very heavy duty. It only hold a few car but its exactly what I was looking for.
4,THOMAS!!,My son (3 yr. old) absolutely loves this toy...it is a nice addition to our collection of trains and tracks!
4,Super Fun but a little weak.,"Thomas battery powered is great. An essential piece to our train set. The only sort of bummer is the rubber traction on the wheels loses its grip from lint or whatever which requires you to ""help"" Thomas going up hill. You just have to clean the rubber frequently with soap and water and let it air dry. Other than that he awesomely pulls and pushes lots of cars around flat track."
4,"Bebop is not for the novice ear, but excellent regardless","Bebop = musical fusion gone wild = extremely cool listen. Really, I haven't had this much fine in ages, as it slides from cool sci-fi blues to rangy Western twang to slippery techno and world music fusion. The show is pretty rad too. :-)Response to musical novice: If jazz is an ancient form of music - the dawn of the 20th century being so long ago as to beggar belief, I suppose - then what in creation is classical? By that standard, toss out Beethoven and Mozart and Brahms, they're all far too long ago to matter. So much for classical. And about Rage being innovative, dig beneath the surface and you'll fine that they ripped off downset to find their sound and Zach himself smokes Marlboros while decrying corporate America. Ignorance on the internet, color me shocked."
5,Love it!,"Item arrived promptly and in the condition I expected-- brand new, in its wrapping. Love Cowboy Bebop, thanks a lot!"
3,Drummer looking for inspiration,"I'm a drummer, playing two shows a week (not just some garage battle of the bands guy), and I'm always looking for new inspiration to shake up my playing. I bought the Cowboy Bebop Soundtrack because my brother is a huge anime fan and had played some of the show for me. I found the intro song (Tank!) exciting and enjoyable, so the rest of the CD was worth the few bucks I paid for it just for some ideas. Really, Tank! was about the only track to impress me, and mostly for the horns and saxophone work. I found four songs work leaving on my MP3 player for the random road song, but nothing to run out and share with the rest of the band. About the best way to describe the sound would be Jazz (Aaron Goldberg style) mixed with Country (think Hank Sr.) with a dash of techno (Daft Punk-esque). All and all, not what I was after, but it does include most of the music found in the series. I'm sure a fan of the TV show, played on Cartoon Network, would appreciate the album."
5,Great Product,"This quick cam has a great quality of picture, especially for such an affordable price!"
4,logitech quickcam,Seems to work as expected. I would not keep the software active at startup because of the system overhead.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The planet Burning Bright has a nice, central location for trade. It is also home to a lot of virtual gaming. A young gamemaster debuts one of her new scenarios here, and becomes an overnight sensation.She attracts the attention of the glitterati and some of the more dangerous higher ups in society, and is embroiled in some dodgy situations because of this."
1,"Eh,..",These shoes are a whole size smaller than marked. I wear a 7 and 7 would not fit me. I had to order an 8. But these seemed bulky and heavy and not confy at all! and the metal detail in the front makes noise. Returning. They look better in the picture than they do in person.
2,not what I expected,"I was hoping this would be something similar to the larger Altec Lansing speaker dock (XM3020) I had purchased in the past. I wanted it because it seemed to be pretty slim for the amount of traveling I would be doing. The base does not have an antenna on the back and needs to be plugged in from side of the portable XM. So it looks silly with the cords coming from the unit. Like an XM on ""Life support"" and of course nothing like the picture. The flip out part is also a bit flimsy so I am guessing it won't last that long. The sound is not that great as with the other Altec speaker dock. If I had another chance I would go back to the other base (XM3020). I like that it has a traveling bag and it does connect to my laptop which I am using as an extra speaker. I am ok with it for now especially for the amount I paid ($25). I will give it another few weeks than I may have to go to the other base."
4,Great for camping,"Took this with us on a trip to Maine, little cabin on a lake, no TV no radio. Great for music and news in the morning. Worked perfectly, great signal and all needed parts fit into the travel bag. I did have to add the antenna from my home kit, as I couldn't get a signal without it."
2,Price of product vs. poor customer service,"Had problem with unit w/in 3 mos of purchase. Was finally able to make contact with company after several WEEKS of trying. Even their customer support line disconnects you when you try to keep holding and don't leave a message. And when you leave a message, it must be deleted, because they don't return calls.Product was replaced w/ refurb unit missing parts. Now I can't get ANYONE!Altec Lansing is a poster child for extremely poor customer service. They have your money, and you have, well, a product with their name on it, for as long as it works. Had I known this prior to purchase, I wouldn't have purchased. It's that simple."
5,Pleasantly Confirmed Expectation of Quality,"My previous experience with Altec Lansing speakers has always been very good. This portable speaker system for XM2GO is further confirmation of the quality you can expect from Altec Lansing. The product is easily portable and even has a travel case. The sound is fantastic with rich bass and the acoustics are amazing for such a small system!! Controls are user friendly and very intuitive. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. Shipping was very quick, too."
4,Party Pack for a 1 Year Old's birthday,"My husband is a huge Steelers fan, so when our daughter turned one, I picked a day for her birthday party. Since we don't have many friends with kids, I just picked a random day in Jan. 2011. Well the day I picked was a major Steelers game. So we couldn't miss the game now could we. So my husband said that we can have a Steelers/1 Year Old birthday party. I ordered this as a suprise to my husband. The price was higher then I wanted to pay, but it made my husband happy. My daughter is a Steelers fan as well. She knows the logo so she was happy as well."
5,HAPPY WITH THE EXTRA POWER,I am very pleased the performance of this equivalent product. It's as good as the EOM battery that come with the camera. I am using it in my new EX-Z1050 camera. It fits in my camera prefectly. The price was unbelievable. Great to have! Did not bust the budget!
1,Battery will not charge,My original batteries died and I bought this for replacement. This battery will not charge. Waste of my money and time.
4,Simple but fun!,"I am a person who enjoys a great shooter. This one is not great but it is fun. The power ups are a little annoying to get and the satellite guns are very rare to find. But one thing I enjoy about a shooter is how hard or challenging it can be. This one is difficult. I will be honest, it is not Radiant Silvergun, Gigawing, R-type, Ikaruga, Silpheed or Thunderforce but it is fun. Great game to have for your shooter collection."
2,This is not the Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack CD,"This is not the Secret of Mana Original soundtrack from the game, aka in Japan: Seiken Densetsu 2 OSV. This CD, the one listed above, is also known as secret of mana plus and is a orchestral mixture that contains some of the themes and original music from the game plus other sounds. You will not find the individual tracks as suggested above by the previous viewer and if you are looking for the game music, you will likely be disappointed. Seek other anime stores for that music cd."
5,Dynamic score for an equally dynamic game,"Unless I am mistaken, this should be the listing for the Seiken Densetsu 2 (or, Secret of Mana) game soundtrack. That being said, rest assured that this is one excellent soundtrack. Composer Hiroki Kikuta wrote a tremendous score for this game, supposedly in only a few weeks. The opening title, ""Fear of the Heavens,"" remains one of the most heart-rending passages ever heard in a video game, and makes for a wonderful opening theme. Kikuta's music ranges from appropriately lighthearted to dark to frantic in the blink of an eye, making it an extremely dynamic soundtrack that should cater to any sort of mood.Highlights include the aforementioned ""Fear of the Heavens,"" ""The Color of the Summer Sky,"" ""The Oracle,"" ""Meridian Dance,"" and the wonderful closing ""I closed my eyes."" Great soundtrack all around."
5,Delightful Trip Down Memory Lane,"A beautiful collection of women who are also beautiful but basically not nice people. They tend to carry guns, knives of bottles of poison. On the other hand, they tend to show a lot of skin and to put the men around them into all kinds of trouble.The surprising thing is just how many actresses have played the heavy in films. Here's Tina Louise (Ginger in Gilligan's Island) in a skimpy toga at the 'Siege of Syracuse.' Here's Lynda Carter in a Bonnie & Clyde like movie before she turned in her gun to be Wonder Woman.And of course there's Angie Dickinson, the queen perhaps of the bad girl in fifty or more western, gangster, and otherwise bad girl films. The keynote of the book, perhaps is an excerpt of an interview with her that was conducted on June 8, 2004. In this she discusses her career and a number of the films she was in.All in all, a bit of nostalgia here to realize just how many of these things I've seen."
1,Horrid,Tacky plastic pieces. Took an eternity to arrive. Customer service lacks proffecionalisim. Also was not shipped when it was supposed to. I placed an order on the first. Recieved order today on sept 11. Never again.
3,Some what satisfied,I was expecting at least one of the circular lip rings but didn't recieve one. The rings were okay but they didn't really stand out to me. I wish I could have choosen the ones I wanted.
4,it was ok.,i got 20 pieces but i got a bunch that look a lot alike. wish it had a little more veriety.
3,Body Jewlery,"This product arrived on time, but did not contain all the different piece of body jewelry as are pictured. Disappointed."
3,dull,when i opened the package and saw the piercings the first thing came to mind was that it looked incredibly dull.most of them were hideous but there were a few good ones.
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,"Worst self tanner I have ever tried in my life, and also the most expensive. It does not work AT ALL. I have applied this every day for 3 days and got no color at all. You would do better with something from the drugstore. What a total waste of money."
5,Pema explains so well and the techniques really work,"I've been practising Tibetan Buddhist meditation and tonglen for many years. Even though these lessons are basic enough for beginners, they are useful and encouraging for more experienced practitioners, as Pema describes approaches different from ones I've learned. Its good to have options so that you can apply the most appropriate or most comfortable approach at any given time. I have not listened to the 3rd disc yet on facing your fears, but I'm looking forward to it."
3,"great playing , lame recording","I bought this hoping it could replace my nearly worn out lp DG 2530236, which is a similar program. No such luck, this is a very poorly remastered live recording. You can hear about enough to imagine how great a recital it must have been. Every track includes the applause which is *way* louder than the piano. Anyone have a spare copy of that LP?"
1,THIS IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY,"Do NOT waste your money on this 1 1/2 page of very, very brief definitions of what separates the last four generations. This is stuff you ALREADY KNOW. I thought I'd learn a few new things to understand working with multiple generations but this was useless. That this should even be sold on Amazon is a rip-off!"
5,True Paul,"Harrington is one of the most accessible writers of scripture who is also a true historical-critical biblical scholar. The Jesus of Mark's Gospel and the real Paul and his understanding of Jesus are revealed to the reader with clarity and verve. He also presents a cogent argument that Paul was not anti-woman at all, but was very much in line with the acceptance of women that Jesus held.I have use this text for years in theology classes, with much success.I wish it were still in print."
5,Best kept secret--better than hairspray,I have heard they are discontinuing this product-what a mistake. I dislike the stiffness and stickiness (on your walls) of hairspray. This product helps maintain the body and curl in even the finest hair while maintaining a soft and natural look. I can't find anything else like it on the market.
4,AMazing...,"Seriously... a good quick read... very balanced young man. So ethical it disgusts me. If more people like John Popeo existed, the world would be a scary place..."
4,Discontinued! Outlook uncertain,"This is a great product, but it is no longer made or supported by 3Com."
3,It's been discontinued,"I was looking forward to buying an Audrey, only to find that it's been discotinued by the manufacturer"
2,"Mainly OK, but terrible customer service","The Audrey mainly worked, but Java and Realplayer pages don't work. Realaudio is OK, so it makes a great web radio. Email is OK but some attachments don't get through. Audrey is a great prototype, but it's not ready for prime time.After many calls to 3com support I still couldn't get a Palm V to sync with it and so they decided that the serial port was faulty and asked me to return it for a replacement. That was four weeks ago! Calling their customer service is an adventure - it's patchy at best. I'd wait for them to get their act together. Leon"
1,NOT user friendly,"We bought this for our Mom with high expectaions based on reviews. Unfortunately, there are SO MANY quirks and limitations that it is actually HARDER to use than a real computer. Email would not forward, could only address to one person at a time, printing just does a 'screen dump' so to print an email, you get about five lines at a time, then you advance to the next page and get the next five lines. Very slow, tedious and useless. HTML email just shows up blank , no error message, so you don't even know that there is a problem, very confusing (3com confirmed that it WON'T receive html - I never noticed if email is html or not, now you have to tell people, bogus). Sorry 3COM, you missed the boat big time. We are going to buy Mom an iMac."
5,Brilliant music and superb sound quality,"I am fairly new to the world of jazz and I want to build a solid base for my collection. I bought this album, along with ""Spiritual Trane"" and ""Standard Trane"" in Japan last month. I love all three recordings. The 20 bit K2 super coding of these Impulse releases enhances the feel of the music. The liner notes and graphic style of the packaging are good. I can't think of a better way to get into John Coltrane."
1,Dull,"I purchased this knife because it received excellent reviews. I must have received a defective item, because it was totally dull. Would not cut vegetables, chicken, nothing. It was worthless and was returned today."
4,Excellent Read,"Hawkins provides an excellent framework from which to carefully think about leadership as a lifestyle. He effectively argues against compartmentalizing the different areas of influence (e.g., family, work) in our lives, but instead, encourages the reader to balance the conflicts that are sure to arise. He also provides useful insights into managing our lives in each area of influence so that we prove ourselves faithful in each.The book is written in a concise and very readable manner. I highly recommend it, and have even purchased additional copies to give to friends and family!!!"
3,God and Leadership,"I liked the authors approach of NOT breaking up our lives into separate components of work, personal, and spiritual. His definition of spiritual, however, may be a little different than mine or yours. While I have nothing against the authors spiritual beliefs I found certain chapters lacking in substance and felt he was relying on God as an excuse for his inability to give clear direction. If it was spiritual direction I was lacking I would be reading a religious text, not a book on leadership."
3,Ein...stein.,"Although the soundtrack series for ""Cowboy Bebop"" is nothing short of an awesome listening experience, I have to wonder about this one. It's an EP length album with only six songs, only three of which are exclusive to this CD. You do get the original version of the closing theme (""The Real Folk Blues""), as well as the cute drum-laden clap-along tune, ""Doggy Dog"", and the short James-Bond-esque ""The Spy"" by Seat Belts (Yoko Kanno's bebop band), but the other songs are also on the other soundtracks. It's a good listen, but I'd only recommend it if you feel you must own every Cowboy Bebop OST."
3,Some noises when it is on,"Arrived on time, before Christmas day and it was very great! My daughter was very happy to have her female locomotive! the only problem is that there is a strange noise when it is on, the wheels sound a noise when turn and it is no so strong as Percy or James that we already took in past."
1,Breaks right away.,"We have had bad luck with this lovely toy. I think it is poorly manufactured because it broke, we got a new one and it broke right away. Our battery powered thomas runs fine. Skip this lady."
3,6 wheeled trains work better,"If you don't have a battery operated train yet, then don't make Lady or Piercy your first purchase. You will be disappointed. THe 6 wheeled trains (James and Thomas) handle just about any track with no problems, while Lady derails probably 5 times as often. She particularly has trouble with tight corners (3"" radius curves).Make battery powered James or Thomas your first purchase, then buy Lady or Piercy after that."
4,Powerful little Lady,"Purchased Lady for one of our b/g 3 y/o twins this Christmas. Our kids are into playing with the Thomas train scenes so we bought them 'Down by the Docks' (got it just in time, guess it is being discontinued). We got our son battery powered Thomas and our daughter received battery powered Lady. All things Thomas were a hit. I will echo what another reviewer wrote. Thomas is pokey! Lady has him beat for pulling power and overall speed. She laps him on the track and ends up pushing him and his load while pullin' her own. The button on top of the BP ones are easy for little hands to work. The only thing that stresses Mom is the gear stripping sound that accompanies the act of pressing off the train if the child holds the train in place while shutting it off. One has to pick up the train so the wheels spin free while pushing the off button. Also, we've already replaced the battery in one of them due to tipped-over-train-syndrome(TOTS) that can arise with 3 y/o attention spans :)"
5,Batter powdered Lady,Lady was a gift for my grandchildren to go with their Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway set. They spend hours playing with the trains and enjoy them immensely. They especially like the battery powdered engines. They have most of them.
5,Equisite train!,"My son has this train, which he obtained at the flea market and he loves it. I bought this one to act as a back up just in case something was to happen to his. It is very well made and has the power to pull quite a few cars. Learning Curve has taken the time to make this product exceptionally well and I would recommend this to any Thomas Train collectors and children that want a strong pulling engine. Thank you Learning Curve and Amazon."
4,So very happily!,John Prater's illustrations are wonderful! (Similar to Barbara Firth's illustrations in the Little Bear books). My 21 month old daughter requests to hear the book over and over.
4,"Although it is documentary....not a comedy stand up, it's informative, insightful.","For those specifically interested in the birth of comedy clubs throughout the Boston area, this will be of interest. And, for those who wish to learn the nuts and bolts & nitty gritty of that area where standup clubs dominated, this, too, will be of interest.The premise of the DVD is the rise of young comedians primarily of the Boston area during the late 70's early 80's. They have stories to tell, the big breaks, stardom, influx of comedians claiming to be from Boston, the many clubs, intense competition, etc., etc.,Some names you will recognize, Denis Leary, Colin Quinn, Lenny Clark, Kevin Meany...but others you won't. There are clips of the acts, but nothing riotious as the box cover claims.So don't expect a standup comedy act of the comedians, as this is documentary, and it is informative at that. If you do see bits, the work is average. ...Rizzo"
2,"Comedy Scene, and Not Heard","This DVD will be a disappointment if you get it hoping to see some substantial portion of the acts of the various comics listed on the cover. All you get here are snippets of performance, at best. The rest is just loose-leaf reminiscence about the good old days in Boston, in the early 80's, when a lot of comics were hanging out together and getting their start.It's like a frat house reunion. There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere."
5,Had me laughing,"This is a very funny book, with dialogue that cracks me up. Great vacation reading or gift for someone with an irreverent sense of humor."
3,Does the job,The workbook correlates well with the assignments that my son has received at school. The drawback is there is no answer key. That would be a great help.
5,Biology,"We have not been able to use this for our homeschooling biology yet. We did not realize we needed to purchase the text book in order to even be able to answer the questions, but flipping through the book it looks like a very through program & we are excited to get started!"
2,"Cute, but very thin","I buy many stockings and pantyhose from ILOVESEXY, however, many of the leg avenue pantyhose are so thin, that they rip,just by putting them on. I only weigh 125lbs, so they should fit perfectly. I reccomend wearing 2 pairs at a time."
3,Incomplete,"The three films in this set are excellent, absolute classics of the genre. But because this set is incomplete, what is the point? They should be watched in order to really understand the story, and to see Nami's experiences in the order in which they played out. However ""Jailhouse 41,"" the second film is missing. So when you watch the first film, and then skip to the third, (Beast Stable) it makes no sense, because it starts out with ""The Scorpion"" outside of jail. Part 1 ended with Nami being returned to prison after dispatching the men who raped her, and the cop who used her. Not to mention, many consider the missing film to be the best of the series, and is certainly the most artistic. I believe there are copyright problems with ""Jailhouse 41,"" because it is never available. This is a fine set, but i just don't see the point of it being released with the middle part of the story missing. why did they bother?"
2,Not the Best...,"I bought this CD expecting it to be the same type of music as the hit (When it Comes)... but when I finally got it, I listened, and kept trying to accept it and appreciate the music... But I still can't bring myself to do so. I will admit that I do, in fact, like ""When it Comes"". Its got a good guitar line and chord progressions - even good vocals. In the rest of the CD, Tyler's voice is husky and ""wannabe"" country. Another okay song is ""The Letter Song""... although I will admit that I cringe every time he says, ""I can be romantic, I just gotsta try to be."" To sum it up, I guess I'll say that if you like pop-country, this is probably for you. Otherwise, make sure you listen to all the samples first and you're sure you'll like it, because for me, it wasn't worth the money.Over and out."
5,Tyler is amazing,"I've just become familiar with Tyler's music and its really incredible. Hes a young, very good looking guy who writes a lot of his own music and plays his instruments. He's very talented and plays alot of music that anyone can relate to. His style of music is very unique but very catchy. If you like to feel for music...get up and dance... or just relax...he's def got it all! His style can be related to Hanson, Gavin Degraw, Johhny Lang, and Ryan Cabera. Nice mix huh? He's defenetly worth the money!!!! :) he's too cute too!!!! <3"
5,Tyler rocks!!!,This music is awsome!!!!! I first heard Tyler when I was at a Hanson concert he was the opening act. Before that I had never heard of him. His performance was amazing and so when he was done we went out to get his autograph. He was so sweet he signed the date and my name as well and was gracious enough to do it on my Hanson tour book becuase I had not been able to get anything of his yet. Anyway he is a great person and his music is absolutely awsome. I highly recomend this cd!!!!!Melinda
5,Tyler Hilton is the best!,"Tyler Hilton's EP may only have a couple songs, but all of them are sooo amazing and good. All of them are my favorites. Tyler Hilton has a really good voice. His music is pop. Def. buy this CD....i promice you wont regret it!!!!"
1,What A Slap In The Face To Masami Ueda,"Do NOT buy this cd. Ever. This was probably just released as a test to see if REfans would buy anything that had ""Resident Evil/Biohazard"" on it.How dare this metamorphis guy ruin such perfect scores.Masami Ueda probably had a heart attack when he heard these awful remixes of his songs.Trance....bah."
2,Too simplistic,"While Mr. Harrison makes some extremely valid arguments in this book , I wish he had also explored why the Anglo-protestant culture , which he holds up as""best in class"" went about enslaving the world and what impact this has had on various countries , whom they enslaved.Perhaps some of the progress those Anglo-protestant societies have made, is due to the fact that they exploited other countries and other peoples and not so much their work ethic as Mr. Harrison seems to suggest"
5,My favorite for 30 years,"I had the amazing good fortune to be acquainted with Bob, and Gary, and Doug, when they were playing lounges in Des Moines. Many a night I sat and nursed a beer, and laughed and cried to their music. He writes some of his songs, but when he does Lightfoot or Guy Clark, or whoever, I almost always like his version better. I wore out the album, and the first CD, and still listen to him almost every day. And he still makes me laugh and cry. He's gone now, but he lives on in mellow tones, and silly giggles. Sometimes I can even hear myself in the background singing along, or laughing. He's been my favorite music since the first time I heard him 30 some years ago. You won't be sorry."
3,great features but beware of difficulty cleaning,"This high chair has some great features - storage space for bibs and washcloths, removable fabric liner for easy machine washing, removable tray for easy cleaning.But it is very difficult to clean the seat. My son always wear a bib with a pocket to catch what doesn't make it to his mouth. Even so, a fair amount of little stuff ends up in the cracks on the side of the chair. And though they look great, the wooden slats are way too close to clean effectively. We wipe down everything else after each meal but there is usually still dried food stuck there until we get out a spray bottle and some serious elbow grease!It is a good-looking chair. But if you are looking for a wood chair, I'd look for other ones. I wish we had gotten one that sat directly at the table with adjustable heights."
1,Don't do it!!,"The high chair looks great when it first comes out of the box but it is all down hill after that. It is impossible to keep clean. The finish is flaking off, after less than 6 months of use. It is not worth the struggle to keep up. If you already have it, call the customer service number and order a second chair pad. It is only $12 and does help to be able to switch out when one is in the wash."
2,"Looks nice, low functionality","I have used this highchair for 2 kids now and finally decided to sell it because I did not like it. It's a beautiful chair and looks great in the kitchen. It's much nicer looking than the 'plastic' ones you see. What I don't like about this chair is the day-to-day functionality of it. It does not adjust, at all. As the baby gets older, I want a chair that tilts, adjusts, etc-- and this does not do that. Also, it is very heavy and hard to move; it does not slide on the floor well at all. The seatbelt is clumsy and a pain to put through the fabric cover when you take the cover on or off for cleaning. After being used multiple times, the velcro that fastens the fabric cover down will no longer stick so every time you lift your child out of the highchair, the cover comes with them. I found myself very frustrated with this chair.I would not recommend this chair to anyone. I do think it's pretty though if you are going strictly by looks!"
2,"compact, but hard to clean","We have a small house, and really wanted two of these high chairs for our twins. Space-wize, they are great; they have a small footprint and look nice along side the rest of our furniture.The 2nd tray and the slide-out cup holders are a great addition to this high chair. The shelf under the seat is a great place to store bibs.The downside of the Eddie Bauer high chair is that its difficult to clean. I have toddler twins, I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning their high chairs with a toothbrush! The slats on the side of the seat are close together and food gets slopped in between them at every meal. If you don't throughly clean this up after each meal, it dries and is difficult to get clean.Another downside is my kids never really fit well into these highchairs. They were always too short for the tray, and the tray was always too far away as opposed to other highchairs. This helped create even more food mess!"
3,Hard to clean!,"I agree with everyone else who says this chair is hard to clean. I bought the lighter colored wood chair, which really makes the grime build up noticeable, especially on the foot rest. We clean the high chair all the time, but the wood almost has an absorbency about it and there's just so much you're able to get clean. And I'm not sure why some areas that have been cleaned have a sticky feeling to them except that maybe it's a reaction of the wood to the chemicals in disinfectant wipes. It looks nice, but I wish I had gone with a plastic, easier to clean high chair."
1,what is it saying?,"not sure what this book is supposed to be. It is really just a rehash of very old ideas about Carroll with some pop culture uncomfortably tacked on. The 'myth' has been dealt with far better by people who really seem to understand it (it's too deep I think for Brooker's milieu), and the pop culture is presented without any kind of analysis or penetration.I think you are better off with Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild' or Sigler's 'Alternative Alices'."
