2,"Worked well, but didn't hold up","I purchased this item in February of 2011 and it worked well until this month. It works for a few minutes after it is fully charged, but then it starts to cut out and I have to go to the handset. I just expected that the product would last longer than a year and eight months."
1,poor product,purchased this product and kept it charged up and it still did not work cant send it back because my name has been placed on it i have been purchasing from amazon for quite some time now and have never purchsed anything that didnt work til now
5,"worth the price, no question","This headset has good range, good sound quality, and is easy to use. I strongly recommend purchasing the handset lifter along with it. The glue on the handset lifter does tend to dry out a little--some doublestick tape will solve the problem. Best thing in my office."
4,Plantronics cordless headset works well,The cordless headset works very well. Set up is easy and well-documented. My only issue is that the microphone mouthpiece fits too close to my lips and there's a bit of an echo. When I move it upward it bumps my glasses. I'm working to get proper adjustment. If the wand were a tad shorter the problem would go away.
4,Plantronics Headset,"The product is very nice, although it SHOULD come with a handset lifter without an extra charge"
1,good concept.. needs more,"I was looking for something i can use all the time, connect to my home like and free me from having to sit at my desk.This has good voice quality.The cons:battery doesn't last longhave to connect it to a handset so no can do with cordless handsetsno hang up capability from the ear piece, you have to go back to your deskthey have a higher model with a keypad you can clip to your belt. maybe that might solve all my issues but i would not recommend this one to others."
5,Simply the BEST!,"I purchased 2 CS55 headsets with the HL-10 Lifter and found this system to be flawless with superb audio. No interferance, no static, none the problems one experiences with bluetooth technology. This system operates at 1.9ghz which gives it greater operating distance (300 ft is a conservative number1) and eliminates any unwanted static, or other noises. Well built, and easy to setup up you can now wander your house and yard and never miss a call or have to say ""what did you say? I can't hear you"". Battey life is excellent. Customer Support is excellent: it is free and lifelong!I purchased my complete setup on the famous auction site for 90. (2 headset, base, lifter, and various headset attachements."
1,WARNING! DANGER! READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!,"NEVER buy ANY tow chain that is only 5/16.A 5/16 chain has a working load limit (aka breaking point) of about 4,000 lbs.That is the empty weight of the AVERAGE car in the United States.ANY chain designed to pull or tow a car should be a MINIMUM of 3/8 in diameter.3/8 inch chain has a Working Load Limit of 6000 lbs - adequate for towing any car or truck.Buying a lesser chain is a safety risk - and when a chain breaks under this much strain, it can cause major physical damage to either vehicle, or loss of life / limb.Those figures are true with good quality American steel. If it is made in China, Japan, or other countries where the metallurgy is not as advanced - who knows? I would expect them to be of lesser quality and greater chance of breaking.I don't care if it says tow chain written all over it, and is painted highway traffic cone orange. If it isn't a 3/8 inch chain - you might be able to tow an ATV out of the mud - but NEVER tow a car with it!"
4,Telecom Managers/Directors Must Know,The material discussed in the book is very relevant and the information is well stated and informative.
1,Disappointed,"I read the few reviews on this book thinking there might be something in there worth adding it to my bookshelf of telecom books. I thought disecting the ""Demonstrating Your Value and ROI"" would be interesting. Too bad the book failed to do that. Other than common sense applications and some unintersting ""case studies"", I didn't see the point of the book except, ""buy my software, I have been a global telecom consultant for years."" ZZZZZzzzzz.... The book gave me the feeling that, ""I want to sell you something"" more than imparting any real competitive advantage type of knowledge on the reader, which was distracting and disappointing. Everytime I thought I might be getting to some kind of earth shattering concept or thought, I was left with some lame story that didn't do anything for me professionally. The title on the front is the most interesting part of the book, don't bother opening it."
2,Did Douglass just completely forget about Faraday?,"SEMI SPOILER: so let me get this straight, through out the whole first novel it's all about Faraday. She marries a man she's disgusted with who basically rapes her all in order to guarantee Axis' safety.. then he goes and sleeps with some chick and all of a sudden she is the end all one true love sorry Faraday, thanks for your sacrifice but you are merely mortal. I couldn't even finish the book I was so disgusted with Axis as a character. If you care about the character dynamics in a book and don't approve of cheating... don't read this book."
1,Not up to par,"There are a lot of epic fantasists out there these days. It takes something unique to make it worthwhile buying them in hardcover.Sara Douglass is NOT unique, or even good, really.I might think her worth it in paperback, and if I feel the need to read any more of this dull and uninspired series, I will get them in that form. But there is not enough talent or story here to warrant a cover price of $25.Check out the work of Melanie Rawn, who did this sort of thing early, Elizabeth Haydon, who does it exceptionally well, or Robert Jordan, who while stringing it out, does understand scope better than anyone. Save your money on this one."
2,Douglass does it again...,"The story still has a lot of potential, as do the characters; the best feature, however, is the growing list of made up and misused words. This list continues to make me laugh, and the more books there are in this series, the longer the list gets. Where *is* the editor? Here's one of my favorite examples:Men aren't virulent! They're VIRILE! Douglass misuses ""virulent"" when she clearly means ""virile"" to describe her male characters' sexual energy."
1,I thought it was dumb,I'm not sure what's touching other people's souls about these books. Theyre kinda like bad supermarket peperbacks. the writing is disorganized and the dialog is dumb. I'd like to see Faraday fall off a cliff.
1,Awful and disappointing,"I started out with the Wayfarer Redemption Book 1 and was excited at discovering a great new author. I loved the characters and the path the story (I thought) was taking. So I bought Enchanter (Book 2) in anticipation of a continuation of said wonders. To say I was disappointed is not going far enough. Every character, except Faraday, disgusted me with their actions. I had loved the characters (the protagonists, at least) and what Douglass wrote in that second book destroyed them. In desparation I skimmed through the third book hoping it would redeem the characters, but to no avail. I am a major fantasy fan, and I decided to try to sell my copy of Enchanter, but no one else wanted it either. This is a series to steer clear of, read something else, anything else would be an improvement."
3,Like the basic foundations but not the main characters,"I do enjoy Sara Douglass's books. I find them entertaining, but in this series so far, the main characters are lacking substance especially Axis, and Azhure. I like the basic plot of the first two books, and how the conflict is built, but Axis is very shallow, and Azhure is insipid. I was prepared to like her b/c I thought she was going to be a strong female character, and instead I am just disappointed. I was prepared to view Axis as the hero with one major flaw, but I didn't think he would be endowed with so many powers. I didn't think his major flaw would be his lust for two women. What happened to Faraday is tragic, but understandable. The whole Axis/Azhure both being enchanter's is laying it on a little too thick. I really hope in the next book that either Axis or Azhure die a horrible death."
5,A wonderful book!,"I picked up Wayfarer Redemption on a whim and loved it! Most recently, I ordered Enchanter and I couldn't put this book down. From the moment I was introduced to Axis in the first one, to the moment he embraces his heritage in Enchanter. The twists and turns and intricacies of this plot are wonderful! The characters really reach out and grab you. I found myself wanting to be a part of the Prophecy. Sara Douglass is a wonderful author and I eagerly await the next book in the series!"
1,Horrible,"The first book in the series created a wonderful fantasy world and characters that you could care about and love.In Enchanter and on into Starman, Sara spends her time destroying the characters you have come to care about and leaves you cheering for Gorgrael as everyone else, except possibly Faraday, have degenerated into vile individuals with little or no redeeming qualities. This leaves the reader with little desire to read on and no emotional attachment to the characters other then general disgust.I am an avid fantasy fan and can forgive a great deal but Sara's own assassination of her characters makes this by far the poorest fantasy series I have read. I dont normally write reviews of the many fantasy books I read (and mostly love) but the last two books in this series were so bad it made me throw them out in hopes I might spare someone the misfortune of picking them up."
4,Good game,This is a good game but it is a little boring with 6 players. It takes a while to get to your turn and sometimes you never even get to play with that many players. Will have to see how it plays with 4 or fewer.
5,Kings on the Corners,This is a card game that we have enjoyed with our friends for some time. We just wanted a new set. This is a good product
3,Not So Fun,"This game is not difficult to learn and it is not difficult to play. Younger children with an attention span of 10 or so minutes will easily be able to play this game.If you are looking for an easy to play game that will entertain a wide range of ages you might enjoy this game. If you are looking for a game that you can talk to others and not concentrate on what is going on in the game, this might be a good game for you to play.However, our family has found many other games we enjoy over this one. This game is a bit slow paced, too simple and boring for our tastes."
4,Good for Two,Good game to play for 2 but more it wasn't as much fun. A good game to have in the closet.
3,Classic Game,We all know the game and all you need is a deck of playing cards. But now we have a board to use when we play and some new scoring rules to boot.
5,Thank you!,Product is in EXCELLANT condition as promised. My kids are having a BLAST with this item! Thanks for the fast shipping! Would purchase from again! Thanks!
2,Kings in the Corner,"This game was pretty easy to play, but there isn't a lot of challenge to the game. The adult players were easily bored playing; however, it may be a fun game for children."
1,Boring,"Could not figure out how to play this game. When we went by the directions, it was boring. Would not recommend this game."
3,Kings In The Corner,"I bought the Kings in the Corner Game as a gift for my daughter in law.She works in a nursing home facility and does entertainment with the residents.Among the games they play she plays this game with them. They enjoy it very muchand it is simple enough for their minds to grasp and keep them interested.She also uses this game to teach her 5 year old recognition, numbers and other skills."
4,Nice game,"We were looking for a few new games to add to our board game collection, and I remembered playing this a few years ago when we went away with some friends. The plastic holder is nice, but can be tricky to get too many cards under the clip, its probably just as easy to use the cards without the plastic section.The game itself is really fun and kept us all amused for almost 5 hours the other night!"
5,We adore this book!,"Toot and Puddle is a wonderful bedtime book - my 3 year old adores it. The lessons of respect for different types of ""adventures"" are wonderful and the illustrations are spectacular.Plus, the illustrations contain all sorts of visual puns that the grownups can appreciate (example: when Puddle, inspired by Toot's trip to Paris, decides to paint, he has Van Gogh's sunflowers at his table. Instead of painting them, he paints an endearingly goofy self-portrait.)Highly recommended for children and their readers!"
4,"cool cd, i guess.","i kinda like ragga jungle, so i bought this cd(along with volumes 4 and 5). i don't know why, but the covers of these cd's remind me of that dire straights video hehehehe.ok, so if you like ragga jungle buy this cd. but i highly recomend vol.5 because it has the ""super sharp shooter"" track on it, and vol.5 get's the most play in my cd player as compared to vol.4 and 3.peace"
4,very nice!,"bought this for a SUPERFAN and he absolutely loved it! He's a BIG bbq-er and he hasn't used it yet, so I don't know how durable it is."
5,Great Case for the MacBook User,"I am very pleased with this case. I recently took it on its first trip and was pleased to find perfect-fit spaces for my Airport Express, iPod, and MagSafe...plus plenty more room for headphones and other items.The handles are covered in leather which makes them comfortable. The area your laptop goes into is heavily padded with thick foam which gives good peace of mind.I do wish it were leather instead of canvas, but you can't have everything."
1,Laptop Case,"My 17"" MAC did not fit even though they said it would. I returned item AT MY OWN EXPENSE."
5,"Perfect bag for Mac 17"" Powerbook","I read reviews that said this is ""the"" bag for you mac powerbook. I have a 17"" - and this bag IS perfect. I feel that my powerbook is safe inside this bag. Good sized pockets to carry external devices etc. I would highly recommend this bag for the protection it offers as well as the extra pockets for all my stuff!"
2,Not for Rats!,"The description says you can use it for rats. My girls chewed through it in just a few minutes. It's a shame because they did enjoy playing in it, but they easily got out. The hard tubes are a much better choice for chewing pets."
3,"Decent, sturdy tunnel but could do a lot better.","I purchased this several months ago for my two ferrets. While they do enjoy it somewhat, it always contracts back to being less than a foot long, no matter how much I try and stretch it out. I leave it hanging for days at a time and it seems stretched out so that there is actually a lot of tunnel for them to go through but it just crunches back up. Also, you can't select a color, which is mildly annoying, though I can't say the ferrets care. I highly recommend the Marhshall Ferret Super Thru-way instead. It is 20 feet long, and I was able to unravel it to its full length and it stayed that way, my ferrets LOVE it. While this tunnel seems to be sturdier, its really not more than a little tube because it always contracts. They vastly prefer the other one and while it seems to have a flimsier design, they havn't poked a hole in it yet."
5,My Ferrets Love these tubes.,My Ferrets Love these tubes. They love to chase each other through these tubes. Really gives them a good workout.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is NOT made for creatures who like to chew! My guinea pigs ate half of it in one afternoon & I thought I'd be making a trip to the vet in exchange for my $40!! (I bought two of them to link together)Also the product is SO flimsy that it just slinks around in circles, does not stay put, and will not go up or down ramps as I had hoped.Perhaps a ferret would be ok with it, but guinea pigs, hamsters, rats or mice are GOING TO CHEW IT and it is made of some filmy kind of plastic that (besides being ruined) cannot possibly be good for their stomach!!You'd think the makers of a product FOR ANIMALS would have the animal's best interest at heart!! Major disappointment!!!"
1,disappointing,"Another case of if I saw this in a book store I wouldn't have bought it. Each page is a one liner, many of the ideas are duplicated (I would say at least 20% of the tips all say: Exercising is a good idea). I expected more practical tips and instead a lot of ""tips"" were just inspirational thoughts like: ""if you think you can do, then you can do it"". Not to say that there weren't one or two ideas that were useful, but certainly not 101 of them. I was able to read the whole book in under 15 mins."
1,Waste of time and money.,"This book was sent as a free gift when I ordered a cookbook through the mail. I'm glad it was free because I nearly threw it out! I later sold it at a garage sale. Each page is a one line quote from various Weight Watchers leaders, members, etc. It's a nice idea, but not a very helpful tool. Very out of character for Weight Watchers, as their cookbooks are all wonderful!"
4,Good for Motivation,This book is great for anyone on the weight watchers program. It's informative and motivational. It provides the guidance you get at the meetings in the privacy of your own home. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Fake,you do not get what is in the picture so think again I got screwed and got these stupid white things with rings that don't go to anything
4,Oscar's Orchestra,This video is very entertaining. The futuristic adventure features classical music with a sprinkling of music history. My children were captivated. Great fun!
2,Not worth the price!,"Reading the reviews, this is suppose to be one of Yaoi Press better production but I feel cheated by the main story not even taking up half the book (This never happens in Japanese manga). I hardly got the hang of the plot when opps it is to be continued... Yes we are suppose to spend more if we wish to follow it. Also there are too much clownish side drawings in this main story. The second story on Sir Gawain is not bad but the drawings are sub standard and amateurish. The last story barely sticks, the artist's large drawings trying to fill up the rest of the book. Again a Western Yaoi which fails to impress. Where is the Western talent to match the Japanese Yaoi?"
1,I will Never Buy from this publisher again!,"I bought this book based on the fact that I was intrigued by the art. WOW what a disapointment it was.Yes the art by Kosen was lovely, however it was only in less that HALF of the book!!!! The other art in the book was HORRIBLE and the stories were pure lameness. When a publisher tells you you are buying a book by an author and artist, you naturally ASSUME that is what you will get, right? Yeah, not in this publishers books.Also a good chunk of the book is ads for their other books.I was severly upset, and honestly if I had bought it from a bookstore I would have RETURNED it, yes it was that bad.It also was a PART 1!! If I had known I was getting into a series I probably would not have gotten it in the first place because that is not what I wanted from this.If you are looking for a multibook series, that is only a small portion of each book, and is way too much money, then this is the book for you. I personally think it was wretched."
3,Where is the rest of the story?,"Let me say first, that it made me angry that the title story only took up the first third of the book and ended in a cliffhanger. I mean, come on, if you don't have your story farther along then that, wait a while to publish. I loved the Saihoshi story, I loved the art, I thought the prince was hysterical (what a nympho) But, the story ended just as it was getting started. AAAAAAARG!The green knight story was a yawn. And the story about the bully and the blind kid was vile and creepy.I will buy Saihoshi 2 because I want to finish the story, but only if I can get it used, at a cut rate. A partial story isn't worth full price.Sex, naughty parts hidden."
2,"Not in any way, shape or form quieter.","Replaced Broan model #671, a very loud, cheap fan, with this upgrade kit. This Broan #690 is in fact louder than the original, despite claims to be 50% quieter. Removed immediately and sent back."
2,Lasted 7 Months,"I bought this to replace a bathroom fan that started grinding itself to death after 10+ years of use. This kit was easy to install and I was initially happy with it. However, it is now only 7 months later and it is now starting to grind itself to death."
4,had to do some metal snipping but unit works fine,This replaced a unit of of different type so I had to snip some metal and had to add some ty-wraps to extend the reach of the cover panel mounting springs but it works fine.
2,Broan 690 Bathroom Fan Upgrade Kit,"I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase, the fan is supposedly more powerful and significantly quieter than typical units, but I found that not to be the case. When operating, this fan sounds like a jet turbine. I plan to remove this unit and re-install the original fan."
5,Perfect Fit and Easy,"Ordered this kit to replace the fan in our small bathroom. Product looks great and was easy to install, probably taking less than 5 minutes. I called Broan just to make sure it would work. I had found a model number on a sticker with a barcode inside the fan housing. Broan gave the OK, and I placed the order."
4,"Easy to install, Grill looks better","Amazon shows 2-6 weeks delivery on this fan, so I bought the Nutone 690N upgrade kit from Home Depot store instead for $30. It is branded Nutone 690N but essentially identical to the Broan 690. I used this upgrade kit to upgrade my existing Broan 688 fan w/o a hitch.The installation was easy and took less than 30 minutes. The larger grill look much better than the older one. It is definitely quieter than the older fan but don't expect miracle !"
4,A good upgrade if you manage your expectations,"The good: It's incredibly easy to install. It really did take about 20 minutes to take out the old fan motor and bracket and put in the new one. These fans have small standard plugs, so there's no electrical work to do. The fan cover is also a nice improvement.The bad: It's quieter, but not by a whole lot. The sound is different. Our utility/powder room/mudroom is just off the living room, so I will still have to close the door when it's running. I can't tell if it's better at moving air than the 50 CFM motor it replaced. Removing steam isn't the issue in the laundry room.Overall: For $28 you can't go wrong. If your current fan is burnt out it's a no-brainer. If you have an older, builder-special fan in a bathroom you'll appreciate the difference."
3,Quiter?? Better?,"Bought 2, and have installed one so far...Claims to reduce fan noise by up to 50%.Not sure at this point if there is any difference - hardly can tell, and certainly not 50% quieter...Will update when the 2nd one is installed.To that point, install was very simple and quick, a project even someone with all thumbs could handle!"
4,Broan Model 690 Fan Upgrade Kit,"On the claims made for this upgrade, it is not quieter than the original I replaced. The original was probably 30 years old when it failed. It did take less than 30 minutes to install and the metal needed to be crimped slightly to fit into the space of the original. It seems to be pushing more air than the original. Overall I like it, and would recommend this change only when the original fails."
1,Guaranteed for 1 year,"There is a good reason for the 1 year guarantee too. These Chinese made, pieces of trash last exactly 13 months (both of the fans I bought did, almost to the day). Get back to making these in America, and maybe they will last 25 years like the original fan did."
3,Not Exactly as Advertised,"I bought these to update my existing fans so as not to replace the entire box structure. I purchased three (3) of them because they boasted 50% quieter plus 20% more air movement. I was disappointed once I installed the first one, but thought I would reserve judgement until I installed the second. Just like the first; as noisy or worse.I called the factory and told them my old fan had a lower sone rating than theirs. What was the problem, and how could they say it was 50% quieter? Turns out the standards for testing were changed sometime between the time my old fan and the new ones were manufactured. Turns out I have the same sound level or perhaps a bit louder than my old fan. On the plus side, it does seem to pull more moisture after a long steamy shower."
5,"Great kit, easy to install with great results","Both of my Bathroom exhaust fans had issues when I bought my condo, One would just make an electrical hum and not do anything while the other was so loud that it was too annoying to use. This upgrade only worked on one of the 2 exhaust fans I had - both Broan. The replacement was much easier than I thought it would be and the fan is much quieter than the other fan I ended up replacing. For the money and time I thought this was an excellent value, and I was really glad they supplied a replacement plastic grille as my old one had become cracked and yellow. Once done its as if you completely replaced the entire Exhaust in only 10 minutes. The Broan BP28 replacement motor and wheel that I used on the other exhaust is twice as loud and only is 70 CFM."
4,As Advertised,"I had very old, 19 years old, Broan 2-Sone models that I used these to replace. These were one Sone louder, but my 2-Sone models were no longer that quiet either. These actually move more air and seem to be better made (to my surprise). It only took ten minutes per fan to replace, another shock. I was very happy with receiving a product that met all the advertised simplicity and at a great price point."
4,"Not quieter, just different with slightly more air flow","Upgraded a 50 CFM Broan 688-K with this kit yesterday. Given the size of the bathroom, it should have at least a 70 CFM fan, if not a 100 CFM fan, to achieve the recommended 8 volume changes per hour. Although the sound of the air is lower, the motor now seems to hum louder in relation. The bathroom mirror fogs up slightly less, so the upgrade kit did make an improvement - it's just not quite enough, though. This was the easiest, cheapest attempt to avoid replacing the whole unit."
1,No Difference ... Don't Waste Your Money,Can't tell the difference from the original fan ... just as noisy. Should have bought a Panasonic. Why pay twice for the same fan?
1,bad way to end a great show,i don't want to be a spoiler but i hated this entire season once you watch it you will see why. but still worth watching. i wish they restarted the show one of the greatest TV shows i have watched and funny.
1,Writers blew Season 8,"We all knew Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher were Leaving ""That 70s Show"", but we still watched with eager anticipation.We still had Hyde, Fez, Jackie, Donna, Red and Kitty and even had Leo, this was plenty enough to carry this great show one last season.What we did not have was any writers who gave a crap !!!Could they have made it any worse than Fez & Jackie together (what a joke)!Randy was a stiff, Danny Masterson was just going through the motions along with everyone else just waiting for the show come to a painful end.The last episode was the only positive point of the entire season, having Kelso and Eric come back, but the perfect ending would have been to have Hyde and Jackie make up and Lauri and Midge make cameos in the show.What a waste of great talent for what could have been a great departing season !!!To all the writers for Season 8.......THANKS FOR NOTHING !!!!!"
4,still great!!,"Having read some negative reviews I bought season 8 to complete the set and didn't really expect too much, what a pleasant surprise!Although Eric has left and Kelso features only in the first few episodes this season maintains the standards set in previous seasons.If you love 70s show, you'll love this!"
5,Come on,This season is not that bad. Yes it could have been better and I know a lot of people are mad because Eric and Micheal are gone but at least Micheal stays in the beginning. Randy is not as bad as people think but that's what I think of it.It is still funny and I think people should give it another change. I am writing this review because I hope to be commented on this and have another helpful review. So please give it a change.Oh and one more thing even though the date of this review says 8/16/08 it is wrong. It says that because I reviewed this then deleted it. The date I made this review was 4/28/09.
1,Season 8 Is A No!!!!,"Season 8 was absolutely awful and that was mainly because the show was missing its 2 largest characters [Eric and Kelso] and to further aggravate the situation that added some guy named ""Randy"". Randy's character was boring, phony and just plain sucked - which further pissed off loyal fans. So not only did we lose 2 BIG characters - they were replaced with 1 dumbass. On a more personal note, I also did not enjoy the ""new and improved Blonde"" Donna either.It was sad to see such an wonderful show, end on such a ridiculous note because the other seasons [esp. 1-6] were just perfect, comedic genius - everything from the characters to the stories were just awesome!!!This is why I gave the lowest ranking to season 8 because not only was it awful but compared to the other seasons it was just a rancid mess!!!!I am just going to pretend that the show only had 6 seasons (because I really did not like 7 either) - that way I can continue to enjoy the show in its ""entirety""."
3,That '70s Show Season 8 was just ok,"In this season, Kelso and Eric were not present. That didnt mean that it was horrible. Yes, it had its funny moments. Also, it was hard to get a grip on the show this season becuase two of the main characters were absent. Randy, the new guy, didnt make me laugh once. He was a waste of time on the show. Without him, season 8 could have had some potential. Otherwise, it wasnt one of my favorite seasons. The best seasons were 4 6 and 7."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I've been watching the entire show and am up to Season 8 and 10 shows in.I'd forgotten that Eric leaves after season 7, and Kelso left about 3 shows into the final season. The show is awful. I'm watching and have 10 shows to go, but I find myself doing something like sitting at the computer and typing or looking up things and just watching it out of the side of my eye. It's pretty awful without Kelso and Eric. You can tell they're really struggling to keep it going. Where there were 25 of all the other seasons, it looks like this season has barely 20, it might be 19. I'm on Episode 11 and trying to decide whether to just go to the last show and watch it and be done with it.The people just aren't funny without Eric and Kelso."
4,season 8,"Parts of season 8 were hard to swallow...but i bought the series after watching on-line - mostly because of the last episode...which I'll admit that I cried when Kitty gave her speech and hugged Donna...I loved how they tied in Hyde's line when in the circle that was also in the first episode about the car that runs on water..I would recommend that if you want the total ""70's show experience"" to buy the whole series and watch in order.Am now hoping that they do a reunion show soon...would love to see the show have a complete ending with every character ever on it."
1,Not worth it!,"This is the worst season of the show. I'm a die hard fan of the show and I just can't stand it. The only episode worth watching is the finale, because Eric and Kelso are in it and Randy hardly appears and talks. This coulve been an alright season withot the new character, Randy. He just ruins everything and just kills the flow of the season. I would recommend not buying this, the first seven seasons only."
3,The final season.,"That '70s Show - Season Eight does not live up to the other seasons of this hilarious show. First of all, Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left this season and even though they show up in the series finale, the magic is gone. Jackie and Fez finally end up together and even though people were upset by that pairing, I kinda always thought they belonged together. The rest of the season is pretty forgettable, I am giving this show 3-star rating because the cast is talented and some of the stories do put a smile on my face. Season 8 is a take it or leave it, you decide for yourself."
3,"Funny at times, slow at times, but worth the price","I was born in the 70's, hence I do not remember anything of substance about the decade. I'm told that this show missed a lot of the essence and fun of that interesting decade, but I am still a guarded (PG-style content)fan of the show.This DVD set is really hilarious at times, other times it is slow and drags on. I was glad to see a couple old characters leave for they were boring and seemed to distract from the humor and the theme.At this current price it's worth the price because about one-half of the episodes are really funny. And one must see how it all wraps up!"
2,Its ok,"Ok the last persons reviewed this doesnt even come close. The show had to end because the ratings went down hill after Eric and Kelso left, but if your a big fan like me you'd buy it because its part of the colection, but if your just trying to buy the seasons you like best this one isnt it. other then this season that show is awsome!!! The guy who plays Randy is the worst actor in the world."
2,Bad season. I say bad season!,"Okay... Topher and Ashton left, that's a blow to the show there. But... this season failed in other aspects too. They knew things were ending and some plots moved way too fast. What was that nervous twitch Fez got during this season? That thing he was always doing with his fingers? The last episode had the potential to be totally awesome and a tear-jerker, but it failed due to the writers needing to inject comedy into everything. I mean, I know this is a sitcom, but that ending could have been so much more. Just as Kitty showing the hosue to potential buyers, when she's reminiscing, it was quite emotional for a bit, but they moved it too fast and ruined the moment by ending it with a joke. I got to watch this because it was included with the 70's Show box set I got, but I wouldn't pay for it on its own. Seasons 1-7 are awesome, get those and just think the show ended when Eric left."
1,Bad Season,"I've laughed maybe once or twice through out the whole season, unlike other seasons where it was every episode had me wanting more. I found Fez starting to irratate me with his immaturity and the fact that he became the object of Jackie's obsession just screamed ""we've run out of ideas here""Adding a new character into a group of friends that were so close and having us believe he was instantly accepted and ""one of them"" is fake.Season 8 is just proof that a good thing can go bad"
1,Save your money!,"I am a HUGE fan of That 70's show! I love this show very much and I highly recommend buying seasons 1-7. But I do not recommend purchasing Season 8.In my opinion, the departures of Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher was not the major problem with season 8. No, the real MAJOR problem was that the shows ""powers that be"" broke up Hyde and Jackie! Huge mistake!!Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Jackie (Mila Kunis) were the most EXCITING couple on the show. They had AMAZING chemistry! They could throw banter back and forth and they were so funny and sexy together.That and the writing was lacking in the last season. Subsequently, the show was not the same funny, fresh, and smart sitcom it used to be, sadly."
2,Bring back the funk.,"Look, this season was most certainly the worst. It seemed like the writers lost who the characters were (since when does Fez become a play boy?!) and that they were tired of writing for this show. There were some funny moments but mostly this season was as awkward as they all looked in the first two seasons. I agree with the one reviewer about the addition of Randy, there was no need to add him into the show. Donna could have done some serious feminism stuff (even though she's my least favorite).Point is, unlike Seinfeld or Friends, this great series went out with a whimper."
3,GaGa for GAGA,I love Lady Gaga! This was a good show if you Like seeing her crazy clothes! It also had some really good information on how she rose to FAME! I learned alot about her that i didnt know before. It was worth what I paid for it. Wish there had been more interviews with her personally. But all you get is commentary from people you dont know and a couple of people you do. Im glad i added this to my GaGa library.
2,"Useless, biased","This is just a fan-made collection of random clips of the singer, with a lot of uninteresting points of view from people that ""know"" Gaga (the only one that was actually important was Michael Bolton). And if you are expecting journalistic value...forget it. It is so biased that it irritated me, plus it got really boring and repetitive after the first third."
5,superb Tolkien music,"This the definately the best musical interpretation of Tolkien's songs I have ever heard. You listen to it and do not doubt that this is how it must have sounded in Middle-earth. Different singers differentiate between how hobbits, elves or men sing songs and all the songs follow the guidelines of the book. There is even an interpretation of Galadriel's song in Elvish! The booklet is illustrated by Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and comes with all the texts. If you like Tolkien's songs, this is a must!"
5,The music performed by the Tolkien Ensemble is really great,The music performed by the Tolkien Ensemble is really great. It really captures the spirit of the trilogy by J.R.R Tolkien - don't miss it
2,Not exactly my idea of Rivendell,"I was disappointed in this Cd. Some of the readings of Tolkien's words are done with very heavy accents, and most of the music is very dark, even the ones that are supposed to be elven. Overall, I was not happy with the CD, even though I knew a lot of talent and work went into it."
1,Censored to pieces,"Absolutely nothing left of the original, the censors have obviously had a field day with this one.. half the footage gone. A mere shell of the movie it once was... let's hear it for the censors! NOT!"
3,Beautiful Young Ingrid Bergman in Stilted Melodrama,"This promising but ultimately disappointing melodrama from author James Hilton (""Goodbye Mr. Chips"") stars a very young and lovely Ingrid Bergman as a naive European refugee who impulsively marries a disturbed playboy (Robert Montgomery). Full of self-loathing and psychotic, he accuses Bergman of fooling around with his best friend (George Saunders) and plots their demise.This could have been a fast-paced, Hitchockian thriller, but unfortunately it falls flat. Bergman is lovely to look at but the film was marred by poor direction and a zombie-like performance by Robert Montgomery (who did a much better impersonation of a psychotic in ""Night Must Fall""). His acting is so wooden and flat that it almost ruins the film - fortunately Bergman's histrionics provide a measure of tension the story badly needs. This role foreshadows her Oscar-winning role in ""Gaslight"", with George Saunders (!) playing the Joseph Cotton role."
1,Self Importance At Its Worst,"A shining example of rocks music's glib self importance. A very faux, indie, alternative, wanna be cool, tediious affair, marked by a grating nasal lead vocal for a voice, dreary, trying too hard to be sarcastic/comical, lyrics, and boring redundant riffs. Very typical of most alternative bands out there today that are riding the same tired bandwagon of trying to be catchy, trying to have a distinct ""look"" or image, but not achieving a level of musicianship to have the listeners really care about the music. Soon to be found in the ""where are they now, wait, I don't even care!"" file of rocks growing cabinet of meaningless bands. If you are intent on purchasing Cooking With Lazers, do yourself a favor and save some money at least, and buy it used: it won't be hard to find."
1,This Is My Body: Luther's Contention for the Real Presence...,I pruchased this for a friend and sent it to him. He said he has read it but I have not gotten any more feed back than that.
3,Well written history of the machinegun,"A well written book that covers the history and applications of the machinegun. I learned a great deal about the ways in which the machinegun is used in battle, much different than I had previously thought. The photos are nice quality but far too few. Many of the guns described are, sadly, not pictured. It is an easy to read book for those who are not technically minded while those of us who had some military background will find it interesting too. Another good addition to the Machinegun library"
2,"Dry, historical overview, not very technical.","I was dissapointed in this book because I expected something interesting given the potential of the subject matter. Instead, the author has produced someting hard to get all the way through. There are few illustrations, none of which seem to be related to the text."
3,Nice book for any personell around tanks,"It's a nice book on tanks and how to destroy them. Surprisingly recent information, for an old looking book. Not a glossy photo book, but good facts and good language."
1,What Sony doesn't tell you...,"The problem with all of the Sony MicroMV cameras is that you cannot use them with any of the standard video editing packages such as Adobe Premiere or Apple's Final Cut Pro. Sony neglects to tell you that you can only use their included MovieShaker software which is notoriously unreliable. So, unless you plan to edit in the analog realm, or not edit at all, you're better off with any other MiniDV or Digital8 camera."
1,Great camera.. poor support,"I AM A SONY FAN. THIS CAMERA IS GREAT WHEN YOU ARE RECORDING AND WATCHING VIDEOS FROM THE CAMERA, BUT.. BUT... THE SUPPORT FOR THIS CAMERA AND THE SOFTWARE THAT CAME WITH THE CD SUCKS... I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND I LOST THE CD THAT CAME WITH THE CAMERA AND YOU USUALLY FIND THE SOFTWARE IN SONY PAGE, THIS TIME I NEED THE SOFTWARE MOVIESHAKER VER 3.1 IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THE VIDEO TO THE COMPUTER TROUGHT FIREWIRE CABLE.. AGAIN THIS SOFTWARE CAME WITH THE CAMERA.. AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT.. I CHAT WITH SONNY TECH SUPPORT AND THEY TOLD THAT I NEED TO BUY THIS SOFTWARE AND DOES'NT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP... I WAS SHOCK BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I BUY SOMETHING FROM SONY AND THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE IN NOT IN THEIR WEB PAGE... SO I HAVE AN EXCELLENT CAMERA BUT IT IS REALLY DIFICULT TO GET THE RIGHT SOFTWARE FROM THEM IN ORDER TO TRANSFER DATA.. BY THE WAY. THE PRICE OF THIS PROGRAM IS $ 70..."
3,Caution! Not compatible with Apple Computers,"I was about to buy this little beauty when I found out Sony's MicroMV system (compressing in MPEG2) is not compatible with Apple's iMovie and other editing software. The editing software that comes with the camcorder (Movie Shaker) is PC only. So if you are a Mac user, save yourself a lot of hassle and prefer a (Sony?) MiniDV camcorder.Apart from this issue, I guess it is a great buy. If I would use a PC, it would be on the top of my wishlist."
2,Good tunes if they were the real thing,"This disc was quite a disappointment. I was expecting to hear original artists, especially since their names appear on the CD. IT'S NOT THE REAL THING. I would absolutely love this CD if it were the real artists, but it's some kind of mock-up that sounds terrible. What a disappointment."
1,A Thick Wart On your Wrist,"I bought this as an interim timepiece while an expensive watch was being repaired. I wanted a simple analog display with an easily adjusted alarm. The watch meets these specs.The problem is appearance. The watch is a much too thick, ugly, wart on your wrist. Awful design!! And I have had several Timex products that I thought were well designed, as well as functional."
5,"How to talk so kids will listen, How to listen so kids will",I cannot tell you enough how many families and chaildren have benefited by this book not only in my immediate family but every friend I have and strangers I speak with. This can change your unruly child into one you never imagined! Just give it a try! You will be astounded!
2,There have to be better books,"First of all, this book is riddled with errors. There are typos up the wazoo! Second, a lot of the optical path diagrams of the instruments are very confusing. You cannot make heads or tales from the illustrations. Skoog has yet to enter the 21st century because everything is in black and white. The picture style is very bland and terribly out of date. Skoog also tries desperately to be pedantic. For example, he describes a computer monitor as a cathode ray tube output device. If you like Atkins, you will love Skoog, or vice versa. It's great as a reference but otherwise worthless. Trust me when I say this book is too wordy, too confusing, and way too 'Cold War' era boring."
2,So disorganized a book that it hurts,There is no clear organization in this book. Seems like they took many papers and at random picked paragraphs out of them. The only place they show organization is when they are introducing stuff in a chapter.Works as a reference book because you can look in the back and find the 6 or seven places your topic of interest is scattered in the book. but in general the gain of knowledge through the organization of this book is near to impossible.The authors of this book should be ashamed of themselves for doing such harm to Chemistry students.
1,order was canceled by seller,i do not have a good review of this item because the order was canciled by the seller.
2,very basic introduction to analytical chem,"This book is pretty much standard for undergrad analytical chemistry but it is not a great text. It provides a very basic introduction to analytical methods in a poorly organised fashion. The information is presented in such a way that it calls for you to memorize rather than understand. The mathematics presented confuse the reader more than they help. I recommend you buy this used. If you plan on pursuing analytical chemistry, this book will quickly be shoved aside to make way for much better books, each specific to a particular instrumental method."
3,"Good overview, but not deep enough","Aside from the blatant errors in the text, the book is a fair intro to modern instruments. Skoog manages to explain most everything enough to understand, but then goes into the mathematics behind the machines. The explanations are not detailed enough to understand. The additional explanations do nothing but confuse the text. If one is able to wade through the confusion, the book is not bad. In a later edition, Skoog would be wise to add more explanations to facilitate understanding, or remove them entirely."
2,Style of writing is painful,"Just start reading the introduction, or flip to anywhere in this book to see all you need to know about it's readability: a bit rough to say the least.For example, in the introduction, the concept of carrying binary data in a shorter period of time on a wire than several measured pulses was presented in such a confusing manner that I was forced to read it 4 times to understand what was already a simple and understood concept to me. The excessive formality of this book is a killer.. It reads at times like a formal mathematics proof book, however, at other times it is a bit more readable.Like people said.. use this for reference.. not for a textbook."
3,Nice try,Only get if you want it for beauty treatments. Frozen it's pretty heavy and stiff. Would hurt to put over a sunburn or after plastic surgery.
3,"Great product, horrible container","P21S works fantastic - I wish I had bought more than 1 bottle. It cleans wheels, engine bays, etc. The bottle is a piece of junk though. First, the sprayer broke, then the bottle cracked. I'd recommend getting a good empty sprayer bottle and put it all in there and throw the bottle away."
2,For experienced U14+ Coaches only!,"If you're an expert coach with a team of skilled U14 or older players, you may find value in this book. The diagrams are detailed, explanations and tips are minimal and overall it has not proved to be helpful to me in coaching my u10 travelling team. The restart chapter in Alan Hargreaves' indispensable ""Skills and Strategies for Coaching Soccer"" proved to be much more helpful."
5,A Text of Banking Law and History,"Written as a college text, it covers the general rules, banking statutes and regulations. The book explains the history of banking in the U.S. It explains how Banks are established, Bank holding companys, securities, electronic and international banking.Most management personal I have met in the banking industry would be well served by this book. The majority seem to have no idea of the laws, rules, or regulations of the banking business.This is the book if your looking for a general overviwe of bankingIt does not have all the Federal Statutes and Regulations, but has the most commonly used codes. (Adding the text of the Statutes and Regulations would be a worthwhile apendix for the third edition.)The 2000 supplement is needed with this text, as the rules and laws are developing quickly."
2,Iconcoclasts vs Idolators,"A presupmtious title for a series. It begs the question, who deemed these people Icons? What a self-agrandizing group, a virtual self-love fest. ""Gag me with a spoon!"""
1,Save your receipt,"I own a Brother HL-1240, so of course I have to use this toner cartridge. But if I had a choice, I'd try someone else's. The problem is always the same. After a few months of great printing (and, BTW, I print maybe a couple dozen sheets a week, if that), a vertical line develops down the left side of every page about three-quarters of an inch from the paper's edge. Don't bother with tech support. They'll tell you to clean the corona wire and drum, which I did a million times to no avail. Eventually I gave up, went out and purchased another cartridge, and voilà, problem solved -- for another couple of months anyway. And then you have to trash the old cartridge which, as you'll be able to tell from shaking it, still has a heavy load of toner left in it. Great little printer; lousy little cartridges. Suppose that's how they make their money, though."
2,Brother Toner TN 430,Product works properly as supposed to work.Only concern is the yield. Not happy with the yield.Lasted about 1000 pages and now it shows toner low.For 1000 pages of yield I would buy a compatible one forhalf the price.
4,Easy install,The cartridge was very easy to install and had very clear instructions. Print quality appears good. Hope the page yield will be good as well.
2,"So, so","Next time I'll buy a Brother brand toner cartridge. The first compatable cartridge they sent me malfunctioned after a few days. The low toner warning appeared, I couldn't assume that the cartridge was was full and the warning signal was the problem. Bright light Business was willing to replace the unit, I ahd to pay postage (one way) and they were slow getting my repalacement to me."
4,Sara in Michigan,"The toner came in good condition. However it took almost a week to arrive. It prints well, but on the ""lighter"" side."
5,A fun start into Kenyon's series!,"As a brand spanking new reader of Kenyon's books (I just started reading them this year), I decided to start from the very beginning. While I was a little apprehensive of the book (it looked like it could be cheesy) I decided that at the very least it would be a fun interlude from my mystery fixation. I'm glad I gave it a chance. I ended up enjoying the book so much that I tore through it in one night.The story of ""magical boy meets mundane girl"" isn't very new or original, but I like the new twist that was put into it. (There are so many reviews that I'm not going to bother summarizing the plot like I normally do.) I really enjoyed reading the romance between Julian & Grace. It made for a nice change of pace from my current murder mystery fixation."
3,Trying to ignore the dialogue...,"This was my first foray into the Dark Hunter series. I liked the romance and the story, but I am not a fan of the writer's style of writing. A lot of slang words such as ""Holy Guacamole"" which I can't even begin to guess what decade that's from. But if you can ignore some corny dialogue, it is a fun story."
1,"So, so, so so so bad... could be used for human torture","So I read alot of romance, and if it has any form of paranormal in it, then sign me up. I've been hitting the serious stuff for a while (Black Dagger Brotherhood,the Midnight Breed series, etc...) and wanted something silly and light with a happy ending. Kenyon is all over the place, and alot of the books in this series (Dark Hunter) had some good star ratings. Then I realized SOMEONE LIED!! This book SUCKED with a capital S-U-C-K-E-D!! I tried so hard, but finally after getting about 3/4 of the way through I had to give up. It was so bad it hurt. I would rather clean dog poop off my kid's shoe than finish this book. IT MAKES NO SENSE... AT ALL!! I won't go into it because all of the other people who gave an HONEST rating will list it all for you, but oh man it was just bad. So, so, so bad."
4,Great romance book,"I absolutely loved this story. Julian was so tortured; my heart just broke for him. He just wanted to be loved and suffered greatly throughout his life. I found myself rooting and caring for him, just like a good book should make you feel. I was glad his love interest wasn't some ditz but a woman with her own life and career. She was warm, intelligent and self aware. I loved her for him and again found myself rooting for their love. I loved the spin on mythology and felt we had just enough back-story and info without being overwhelmed by it. I am eager to read the rest of the series and I would recommend this book."
3,"Great beggining, but.....","I read the excerpt from Amazon & I couldn't wait to get the book. It started out great, but I couldn't feel much for the characters, & I didn't like Grace much (the heroin) at the beginning, not someone strong enough for the hero. Also I couldn't connect with Julian (the hero).What I couldn't figure out is that if he couldn't be with her -physically- till the end of the month then why the hell was he jumping in the shower with her at every opportunity???? He must have titanium self-control! Also, for someone who was trapped for god knows how long in darkness, I expected him to feel more interested in seeing the world around him when given the chance. Why not spend the time doing something together that helps them learn more about each other, WITHOUT the temptations of getting naked... ALL the time!All in all it's a light read, no need to use your brains much, only to remember the names.If you like time travel & hunks then I would recommend [other books]."
1,No where near as good as later books,"I didn't discover this author until book #18 - Bad Moon Rising. Since I enjoyed Bad Moon Rising so much, I was anxious to begin with book #1 in this series . . . MISTAKE. It reads like a Harlequin romance. I struggled to make myself finish this book. I'm glad it was from the library and I hadn't actually purchased it. While I do enjoy her later books, this one is awful. I'm in agreement with the other 1-star reviews. If you feel you absolutely MUST read this book - save the money and get it from the library. You'll never re-read it."
3,weird,"I was 3/4 of the way through this book when it suddenly dawned on me that I've read it before. Apparently back in 2002 when it was first published. I can't for the life of me remember what I thought of it when I first read it, but this second time around I found it a bit flaky.You have a guy being used as a sex slave for 2000 years and woman who happens to be sex doctor, whose afraid to have sex. Ooookaaay. I can easily see why I forgot it. What was cool about reading it again is the fun of seeing where it all begun--the Dark Hunter series. Of course, Julian, the hero is no dark hunter, but his only friend from his previous life is, and the reader can go on to his story in the next novel, which is much better."
5,Absolutely breath taking,"This book is the most beautiful book I have read in a long time, and I have been a reader since 6. My manager begged me to read them and I was glued. I read anywhere anytime and lost sleep over this book. It is a definite must read. True love should be like this. Twilight has Jack squat over their love. EVERYONE PLEASE READ! I swear you won't regret it."
5,Loved it!,"This book is still one of my favorites. It has it all: love, heartbreak, action, humor and romance. I read this for the first time in 2003 and it's still a wonderful book. One of the few that make you believe true love is possible. Thank you Ms. Kenyon for the excellent story!"
4,Every Gal's Dream,"So yes it's an absurd premise about a god-like creature trapped in a book that can only be released to be a woman's sex slave but come on ladies. If you're reading romance novels than no doubt you have had a day dream along these lines. What if Michelangelo's David could come to life just for you? Sexy tension throughout the book, nice characters with a sweet plot. I only got frustrated at the end when it seemed to get a little bit overlong. Also,the Gods in the book spoke in such casual and flippant ways that the writing seemed a little bit juvenile. The dialogue could have used some work. However, overall a very nice book that will please everyone who reads it I'm sure."
4,can't put it down,"I have become a big fan of Sherrilyn kenyon, after reading few of her dark-hunter series. I went back and order her other books, thank goodness I was on vacation, I finished the book in 2 days. Couldn't put it down, if you are a true fan, you will enjoy this book. Sex, adventure and romance, just enough balance of each."
2,Poor execution,"Story was very contrived and unbelievable. Just about every paragraph has some mention of Julian ""feeling her pain and seeing her true heart"" or Grace ""gazing into his eyes and wanting to save him."" Come on, they met each other yesterday and I can't imagine them actually caring about each other like that. Plus there were the all too convenient plot twists, and constant mentions of his hot body yet she says she has self-control... Ugh it was just incredibly silly. Felt like a bad YA novel, high school-ish romance type, only with gratuitous adult content. I had a difficult time believing Grace was a true grown adult with the way she acted about her ""trauma"" and overall naive personality, 29 or 30+ years old?? Sounded like a 15 year old to me. Read it if you're bored but it wasn't as good as the synopsis sounded initially."
1,AWFUL,"This I believe is a book women might enjoy, since half of the books is about a description on how good Julian looks, and how erotic his touch over Grace is. The rest of the book might not be as bad, but it has a pink novel ending."
2,"Goofy, thinly-disguised porn","but sort of fun if what you want is sex scenes. More ""hot"" than plot--Just don't buy it for character development."
3,Not a Pulitzer prize winner ...but still a fun read.,"This is definitely a ""fluff"" book. But I still found it an enjoyable read."
2,I skimmed most of it..,"It started off good. I found the writing style to be interesting and funny, and I was intrigued about the plot.But when Cupid and a million other Greek Gods entered the story it all got rather ridiculous. I wasn't sure whether it was meant to be a comedy or drama. Plus all the characters did was whine about their past. C'mon people, it was a very long time ago, lets just move on.All the romantic scenes were boring. Grace ""moaned"" A LOT.I skimmed about 60% of the book.But, that being said, I will pick up the second in the series out of curiosity. Just to see what it is like."
4,An Interesting and Crafty Twist to Romance,"This is not your typical romance, which makes it very refreshing to read. I read the book in less than one day because I could not stop ""reading just a few more pages to see what happens next."" The book is well written and the characters, although some are mythological, are believable. If you are not usually a romance reader and came across this book by accident like I did -- Don't scoff at it! Give it a try and you will be very pleased. I especially enjoyed the sequel, Night Pleasure, and I am looking forward to the next book that is due out soon, Night Embrace."
1,soft porn,"If you like 'soft porn' then this is the book for you, gratuitous sex revolving around a 'no plot' book.Yuck....wish I had my money back on this one.Not my cup of tea."
3,2.5 stars. A little too syrupy sweet for me. Too much like a fairy tale.,"It was ok to read, but I wished it would be over sooner. However, there was an interesting thought that stayed with me after reading the book. Julian was so georgeous and physically perfect that women were constantly coming up to him in public, making passes and invitations toward him. He was constantly surrounded by women and having to say no to women he didn't know. It reminded me that it is nice when strangers leave you alone.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes five. Setting: current day New Orleans. Copyright: 2002. Genre: paranormal romance.For a list of my reviews of other books by this author, see my 3 star review of ""Night Pleasures"" posted 6/19/08."
4,Good Book!,I liked this book. It is not the typical no brain romance novel. It involves greek myth along with a hunky alpha male type. I normally don't like this type of book but I read it for the great use of myth.
1,I do not understand the hype about this book !,"One puerile, stupid, overweight, heroine, falls for one greek god ... All is unbelievable ! The characters are GROSS ! The story far-fetched !All in all, I found this one boring, I did not finish it.One star for the model on the cover !"
1,Relentlessly tedious and simple,"I was looking up mythology and downloaded this hellhole, accidentally, because my husband came into the room and distracted me. Since it was 7.99 and found no way to return it, I read this horrific excuse for a book. Because so little thought went into it, I read it in 4 hours. If I could give it zero stars, I would have, but that was not an option. It was poorly written with the intellect of a 12 year old. It was not accurate. It seemed as if a bored homemaker wanted to create a universe, which was terribly boring for others, but, somehow, not mundane for herself. The publication of this book serves as example that anyone can get published--anyone. If you like tedium punctated by unimaginative sex scenes, this book is still not for you because it does not even deliver that. I don't know who she knows, but somehow I had the misfortune of downloading this text. I regret that I have lost 4 hours of my life that will never gain back."
3,Not so much,"I wanted to love this book, but really didn't like the repetitive lines and feel the way most do the writing was mediocre but have read that the rest of the series is very good and you need to read this one. I will try the next but not so much on this one."
3,Had its moments...,"This has been in my to-be-read pile for quite a while. I enjoyed the idea behind the story, but the plot was a little disjointed and too sluggish at times. Themes/issues were repeated too often (hero wanted to stay with heroine, but didn't want to put her in danger; the heroine wanted hero to stay, but wanted him to go back to his own time if he would be happier... this ""angst"" was repeated over and over again to the end). The author threw in a stalker mini-plot that really didn't seem to have anything to do with plot and didn't move it forward, or reveal anything new about the characters. Some of the dialogue was silly and/or unrealistic, and the sex scenes were flat (very skip-able). All that said, I did finish the book, which is why it got more than a couple stars. The fact that I was able to put it down very easily multiple times before finishing it kept it from getting more than three."
2,boring and I am not sure why...,"This story had a good premise but something got lost along the way. I like a book that I don't want to put down and this was a struggle to finish. There were likable characters in Selena, Julian, Grace. The Greek gods were typical of mythology in that they interfered with human life and had conflicts with one another which spilled over affecting humans. There was personal growth for the H&H. I guess that leaves the actual story telling as the reason the book did not entertain me."
4,Great start to a good series,"I mean who wouldnt want to gread about a greek love god, who has been a sex slave for 2k years! There are a few goofy spots, but I devoured this book in a day. The reader is introduced to a modern world full of the ancient greek gods, once I got used to the idea, goofy, surreal, but it worked. Especially since Julian was so damn sexy! lol"
4,Very Hot,"This is the third book of hers that I have read. They have all been a very easy read so far, of the others I have read though this is by far my favorite. Could not put it down. So release your hold on reality and enjoy this book."
3,I'm currently in a love/hate relationship with Sherrilyn Kenyon,"I think she's a good writer with some interesting plot lines and characters. I just wish EVERYONE didn't turn out to be immortal/supernaturally-abled/Gods or Goddesses, etc. Still, this series makes for fun reading when in between books."
5,wonderful!!,"Verry far fetched but verry captivating. But isn't that what fiction is all about. I liked it so much, I went out and bot the rest of her books. Ha ha."
3,Should be much better.,"The author starts off so well, the pace is good. However, from page 249 you get the impression the author is rushing the end. The last 58 pages just seemed hurried, get every thing in no matter how ridiculious it sounds.It would have been 5 stars had the ending been lengthened anotherthirty pages."
3,This book was good but still...,"This was a good solid book, and I will read her next one that comes out in the fall. But there were a few things I just found lacking in this book. I didn't really like the main female character and I hate to say it, but I usally don't want to read about frumppy female leads in books. I don't read books for realistic characters so I would much rather have the characters attractive."
1,Four stars?? Are you kidding me?!,"I picked this book up b/c of the great reviews. The reviews were so great, and the book was so highly recommended to me by trusted book friends, that I even bought the book! UGH!! Within the first chapter, it was so awful that I contacted said friends to confirm I'd gotten the right book. I swear, I thought I'd gotten the wrong book by mistake. Nope! I'm sorry to say this, because it's not like I can write a book or anything, but this is one of the worst books I've ever read, and that's saying a lot, considering how much I read. I laughed out loud at the dialogue and descriptions. They were just ridiculous!! It makes me mad that this book gets such high reviews, and then I check the reviews on books by other authors, whom I've read and enjoyed thoroughly, and their books are getting 3 stars. GRRRRRR. I don't get it."
1,Don't bother with this book,"I like the concept of the Dark Hunter books, but you don't need to read this one to understand the series. And that is fortunate because it is terrible. It is poorly written as though the author has all these cool characters to write about but doesn't know what to do with them. Sherrilyn Kenyon is usually able to write fun dialogue but here her limited talent fails her. The plot is just dumb. The sex scenes are boring - filled with flowery language and redundant phrases that make the whole thing the opposite of hot. Don't bother."
1,Save Your Money,"If you want to read this book, go to the library. I believed all the five-star reviews and bought it. If I could get a nickel for every time Julian swirls his tongue around Grace's peaks and nub, I'd have my money back.I could buy into Julian being cursed to live within a book for eternity, but I couldn't buy the 29-year-old sex therapist who has had sex once and an orgasm never. Nor could I believe her friend Selena, who has two Ph.D.'s (in ancient history and physics, no less) and works at the mall reading tarot cards.If you make it to the end, you'll get to see Julian fight and get killed, come back to life, fight again, and kill his killer. Not to mention some bizarre conversations with goddesses.I hoped this would be the beginning of a series I would read, but I'll wait for the next book by Charlaine Harris, Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb, Janet Evanovich, and Diana Gabaldon. I recommend skipping Kenyon and trying one of these excellent writers."
5,What an escape!,"I am so thankful Sherrilyn wrote this book. I've read so many romance novels and have become bored with the predictability of them. Sherrilyn's heroine, Grace, was NORMAL. She was like most women today: wishing she could drop 20 pounds, average in looks, etc. She wasn't 5 foot 9 and 110 pounds and model-material, like most romance heroines! This book truly was a fantasy... and I loved it. The lead male was a Greek God, gorgeous, and very captivated by Grace. Meanwhile, beautiful women would throw themselves at Julian and he wouldn't even blink an eye. How refreshing!The dialogue in the book also was hilarious. I couldn't help but laugh out loud through out the story. I highly encourage women everywhere to find a shaded tree somewhere, sit down and escape into Sherrilyn's world. You won't regret it!"
4,"Sweet, humorous, and very sexy...","In Fantasy Lover, Kenyon begins to build a fascinating world in which the Greek gods and heroes, etc. still live and interact with humans. Her characterizations of them and their receptivity to the modern world are quite interesting.Kenyon's elevation of sex over romance makes sense in this book since the hero is a love slave. The heroine's ability to see the man behind the body provides a window into his tormented soul. Still, Grace as a frigid sex therapist is an odd sort of twist.In any event, the book is definitely worth the read, even if some events scream their arrival chapters ahead of time. If you're looking for something steamy with a dose of pathos and a dollop of humor, try this one by Kenyon."
2,Tea: I think I might just pass.,"Overall I found the story boring and and the characters one dimensional.It follows the story of a man, who is cursed to be a love slave forever...ends up with a woman in present day, who sees him for more than his love slave talents.It's a romance, yes...but for me it was a mediocre romance. Seemed like an interesting idea for a story when I ready the synopsis, but it just lacked any real depth to it or the characters. I would classify it under 'Light Read'.I wanted a little more meat on the bones of the story. I wanted it to be one of those books I couldn't put down because it had grabbed my attention so much, you find yourself staying up late at night just to read it. But for me, this was a miss.If you're looking for a light romantic read, this might just be right up your alley and you might be rewarded by trying it out.For those looking for more meat, I'd recommend Kresley Cole, or Elizabeth Vaughan..if you want something that's more stimulating.."
3,Couldn't take it seriously.,"A Macedonian love-slave from second century B.C is temporarily freed from his prison (a book) by a 21st century sex therapist. They have 30 days before he is trapped in the book again.There is definitely more sex in this book than I'm used to. I wanted to love this book because of all the high ratings, but I was a bit disappointed. Perhaps it focused too much on Julian's (the sex-slave) enthusiasm for sex at the beginning, or the twists at the ending were too convenient. This book made me giggle and I just couldn't take it seriously."
5,great book,Great Book. Love Sherrilyn Kenyon's books. She does a great job and keeps the suspense up till the end which is great. The hero is handsome the heroine is beautiful inside and out. Loved it.
3,My First Book by this Author,"Cute, Romance novel, I found it to be a enjoyable way to pass the afternoon. Lots of my bookclub members recommended this series to me so I will go ahead and read the next book in the series. I have been told that each book just gets better and better and that I will fall in love with the series."
5,in love with it,"I was engrossed with this book from start to finish. It was hot, and steamy just the way I like it:)"
5,The beginning of a fabulous relationship,"This was the first romance I'd read in 10 years. So I missed a lot of the build up to the paranormal trend. But I'm glad this was my introduction. These characters, while stereotypical, are not cookie-cutter and actually draw you into their plight(s).The series in general is well-rounded with a fine basis in mythology. This book in particular had me hooked, trying to figure out what the exact governing laws were, and hoping that everyone would get together for their happily ever after. I could definitely see making a tradition of re-reading the entire series whenever a new one is released."
3,Just OK,"The story was good, the characters interesting... but it seems to me as if the author kept repeating feelings, thoughts, etc. over and over.... it was like she was trying to drill into the readers head the same information over and over.... I will read the next book in the series and hope it is better."
5,My first from this author...but not my last!!,I loved this story. Julian's suffering broke my heart and Grace was awesome. Loved the humor and the mythology references. I wonder if Amazon sells the Greek love slave book??
5,Fantasy Lover...Absolutely,A great starts to an even greater series. Definately reccomend. The charachters can be a bit corny at times but they make up for it in great dialog and love scenes to knock your socks off. The Greek Mythology is one of my favorite parts.
4,Nice but certainly not perfect,"This is a real nice paranormal romance and I surely enjoyed reading it, but I must admit is seems to me slightly overated. A very nice book, but there are betters out there that don't have that many positive reviews. Anyway, I would certainly recommend it to romance fans who don't mind a little fantasy and paranormal elements in their stories, but don't expect a masterpiece. If you enjoy paranormal, The Bride Finder is much much better."
2,2.5 stars. Oversimple,"2.5 stars.Julian of Macedon was adorable and I loved him to pieces, but I didn't like anything else unfortunately.I couldn't warm up to Grace. It's not that I don't believe that her first experience with the sex was bad and left her shocked, but she was 24 and really the whole finding out about the bet was - how can I explain - trite. ***spoiler*** As it was very predictable that she would meet the offender again and Julian would take her revenge.***end spoiler*** The writing was oversimple. It was a quick read and although I found it a little bit boring, at least the story flowed, because there were a lot of things happening. The stalker theme left me perplexed ***spoiler*** because I think there was no reason to have the guy killed in such a light book ***end spoiler***.The book wasn't mind-blowing, but it's not a book I'd tell somebody not to read. It's just right for a few thoughtless hours. Plus I think Julian is really a good character."
1,Simply aweful....,"Read all the other bad reviews and add my name. This is another ""damn did I get taken in by the hype"" book. I wish I could ship it back to the author and offer to help her find a creative writing class! Pure trash! Please don't waste your money!"
2,Blah blah blah,"This book was light as a feather. I wasn't sure I was going to get through page after page of ""should she? shouldn't she?"" ""does he really love me"" and all that lusting...honestly! It could be a teenage angst novel. If I read fantasy, I'd like some form of believability to be involved, this was just teenage conflict and lust. Yech."
4,Weird how perspectives change...,"I just re-read this after reading Kenyon's latest, DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.I confess, when I first read FANTASY LOVER, I was sort of ""feh"" about it... it was cute, but I wasn't blown away. As the series wore on, I became a true, abiding fan. Okay, a freak, then.DARK SIDE OF THE MOON was SO bad that when I re-read this, it was like discovering gold in my backyard.FANTASY LOVER is adorable, engaging, the characters deeply easy to love. It's a gem, and I'm glad to have kept it in spite of my initial lukewarm feelings."
2,Disappointing,"The premise of this book was too good to pass up, so even though I didn't enjoy the last Sharilyn Kenyon book I read, I bought it. I liked the characters, especially the male character, and it was pretty unique but it just took these bizarre turns here and there into the utterly unbelievable. Fantasy is fine and you expect it in her books, of course, but it should feel like it fits and it didn't in this book. It was merely a distraction. In addition, I'm not a fan of her cutsey dialouge between the characters (I didn't like it in the other book, either). It wasn't horrible but it really could have been so much better."
2,Bodice ripper,"I picked up this book, this first in a series, on advice (from Amazon) that it was a good paranormal fiction book, the first in a series.It turned out to be a ""bodice ripper"", every few pages replete with lush descriptions of how one of the main characters (or his or her body, against his or her wishes) physically and/or emotionally longed for another one...The facts that one of the main characters was a 2000-year-old general from Macedonia, and that his family and circle of acquaintances included several Greek gods who made short appearances in the story, added an unusual twist. For the most part, though, these characters were not fully developed, and used quite literally as ""dei ex machina"" to introduce or overcome plot obstacles.For fans of the ""bodice ripper"" genre, this book provides an interesting enough twist to be worth the read; but readers looking for good fiction with a paranormal bent should be steered elsewhere."
1,Like watching a B movie - no wait.. a B porn movie from the 80s,"I can't recall ever having read anything as talentless as Fantasy Lover.It was so lousy that at times I was laughing out loud in disbelief which is the only positive remark I can add to this review. I'm from Denmark so sorry for any spelling errors or the like but really... this book is supposed to take place in 2002 and yet one finds one self being thrown right back to the 80's where we (let us just admit it) had no style, no taste, no understanding of quality what so ever.In this story with 80s characters, whenever a problem pops up, a God appears and then everything is alright again. Grace, the main character, is totally unbelievable and so is Julian, the SEX half-god with wool for brains.This book is simply poor writing and poor thinking. There is a lot of sex for women to enjoy but still.... even that quickly feels ridiculous. It just isn't enough of an excuse to publish this book...."
3,Start Of The Dark Hunter Series!,"If you have never read any of Kenyon's Dark Hunter Books, I would say that this book does not really live up to the great writing in the series which starts with Kyrian's story in Book #2. However, as Julian from Book #1 shows up in many of the Dark Hunter stories, it is important to read his story. Kenyon's Dark Hunter series is a must read, I have to say I love each and every one of the stories and looked forward anxiously to the next in the series and I am excited to read her newest book ""Bad Moon Rising"" that is due out in August '09. I would highly recommend this series if you are at all hesitant about starting it! Keep up the good writing Sherrilyn!"
3,cute but a bit cornball........,"This was my first Sherrilyn Kenyon book. While the book was enjoyable, I do have to agree with other reviewers that a lot of the dialog was amateurish at best and not realistic at all. For example-who do you know that says the phrase ""holy green guacamole""?If the dialog had been improved, as well as less time spent on how ""godly gorgeous"" Julian was, how plain Grace was, and finally the cringe worthy ""sleazy"" inner dialog the H/H had for each other then the book would have rated four stars.I liked the book enough to give the second book a try and see if the author's writing gains any depth, otherwise I'll skip the rest of the series.3 stars for a good try."
2,Obviously a first book,"I'm really glad I didn't pay money for this book. I could some it up in one word, ""corny."" This really disappointed me due to all the positive reviews. I won't repeat some of the things others have said who didn't care much for the book. I agree wholeheartedly. It really felt like a first book with inconsistent plot points, dead ends, etc.As a positive, the characters were pretty well developed and quite likable. While Grace's professional life was completely unbelievable considering her personality and experiences, I did enjoy that the ""unpopular"" girl got the popular guy in the end.Speaking of the ending, it felt rushed and it become downright ridiculous at times. I also got very tired of the ""tortured"" hero routine."
4,"Greek Mythology, pizza, and a sex slave what more can you ask for?","From the very beginning this book has caught my attention. Fantasy Lover is funny, sad, has colorful characters, and love scenes are scintillating. Ughhh... there are some things that I want to say, but I do not want to ruin details by being to explicit."
5,Loved It!,"Can't read these books fast enough. This one was very good. I haven't been disappointed yet. I love the strong, sexy, gorgeous guys and the regular, everyday women they fall in love with."
2,Fantasy Lover,Would probably be an excellent book for a female reader. I had purchased it for my son and he found it too sappy.
4,Great Start,"This book was a great start to a new series, it wasn't at anticlimatic as her other books, but it lays a great foundation."
1,Don't bother!,These are bootleg CD's dubbed from poor quality 78's.Decca Broadway went back to the masters for their CD which sounds much much better:A Connecticut Yankee
3,Pretty good,"This is reissue of the first Broadway revival of ""A Connecticut Yankee"" starring Vivienne Segal and Vera-ellen (is her only major Broadway role). The cd is pretty good. Segal's performance is, as always, charming . I love ""To keep My Love Alive"" and i think that her performance is the best!. The CD also include addition songs by famous artist such ad Milton Berle and Bing Crosby, and a very rare song ""The Bombardier Song "" written for the army during the WW2"
1,Do not buy from this seller,"I purchased this book and paid for expedited shipping. Within 2 weeks, the book had still not arrived. I emailed the seller 3 times and did not receive any communication in return. I was forced to go through Amazon to get a return started, which took another 2 weeks. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
5,The best work lamp out there!,"An awesome lamp! Far better than other gooseneck style lamps on the market. The Danray lamp has a stiff neck that stays exactly where you position it - other brands flop and droop. The bulb cover on the Danray lamp stays cool to the touch and is easily moved. With other brands the cover gets super hot and has to moved by the neck only. Accidentally touching the cover burns!The Danray magnifying accessory is great, too!"
2,Just a Picture Book,Just buy it for the picture's. Very little if any help to the modeler. All three books are the same as for helping the modeler.
5,cute,these number plate frames have gotten a lot of comments..they r very cute but not to stand outish..love them..easy install
5,Great to be plastic,they are more noticeable than i thought they would be...everyone sees them and loves them! theyre great
3,These were okay,"It did not take long for these to turn color and look an ugly yellow instead of the white that shows in the picture. They were cute while they lasted, but they broke, in my opinion, way to soon."
2,Didn't last long....,"These frames are very cute but didn't last very long. I bought them like 2 or 3 months ago and today I went out to my car and half of the frame was broken off. They are pretty cheap, made of plastic. The next ones I buy will be metal. Very disappointed in this product :("
5,Zebra print,I wanted a zebra licence plate and this was perfect and you get two! And the price isnt that bad either.
3,"Decent Product, Needs Screws","Not as lightweight/flimsy as I thought they would be. A more flexible plastic, not prone to getting brittle. It would have been nice if screws were included, but from other reviews, I knew they were not. Even so, it might be a note to the company that it is something consumers would like."
2,Pelican Bay,"As a rash of mysterious deaths shake the habitual peace of Pelican Bay, police detective, Maggie Skerritt is determined to find out who is ending lives that were just beginning to come together. There is no apparent motive of gain in more than one of them, but they all do share a link. All of them were involved in the same diet program. As Maggie delves deeper, the case turns sicker and more sinister. If she's not careful, Maggie will never get a chance to get her own life on track.** If you buy this book looking for romance, you're doomed to disappointment. It's very light on that aspect. However, this is a mystery with all the intricacy of a Columbo mystery, though the killer is not revealed until the end. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,This is the perfect protection case for the Cowon D2. I'm very happy with the product and the fast delivery considering that it is coming from South Korea. Very affordable price and excellent communication with the seller. I added it to my favorites! Thank you
5,better than any other case,This is a very protective case. I bought it because I'm quite clumsy and this has done a very nice job protecting my mp3.
4,nice case,"very nice case, fits game perfectly with room for extra cards, etc. One downside is you can't specify color when ordering."
2,third time's a charm,They should have stopped at III.I found one song on IV that I liked.I wish I could get my money back.
4,The Spirit continues,"Like we heard on Buddah Bar II and Buddah Bar III, the spiritual music is quite presentent on the first hand at Buddah Bar IV. With more than ever exotic sounds, the first CD involves oneself on a never ending journey...The second CD, as we could wait, quite impresing and with the often heard techno-music that comes with every single Buddah Bar second hand. A piece of delight for the modern music lovers.Not better than ""Buddah Bar persents Chillout in Paris"", Buddah Bar IV is maybe the second best of the Buddah Bar line.A must have for the spiritual modern music lover..."
4,Cinco De Mayo Everyday!,We love this machine. Although it takes a little time to make this machine is awesome. Follow the directions given and you will have the perfect margarita. A little hard to clean but very highly recommended.
5,unbelievable,"this cd is another dope outing from gil and while this isn't one of gil's legendary albums i am continually amazed by the quantity of good songs he made. different versions of aquele abraco, baba alapala, and mar de copacabana complemented by new songs like vida e quarto mundo -- it's a strong album. there's some funk: aquele abraco and baba alapala; there's some afro-style guitar: vida; reggae: quarto mundo; and even some pretty far out there experimental stuff: musicas incindentais.overall it's another upbeat album from gil to put you in a good mood.recommended"
4,Nipple Nibblers,"I really like this product. I don't think it's something I will be using on my nipples, but it sure makes a good chapstick!"
1,"Sorry, but outdated","Happily, my mother kept all my old Berenstain Bears books from my childhood. I've been sharing them with my son, and he loves them. However, this is the only title which I got rid of. The main reason- Mama's job is just for extra/fun/spending money. In our home, and many homes in the U.S., Mama's job is an absolute necessity. This one is badly in need of an update (look at the publishing date)."
5,Good topic,"Purchased this to get our seven year old ready for mom to return to work. Just like others in this series, this one is good for bedtime reading. The Berenstain Bears are our family's favorite and several appear each year for birthdays and holiday gifts."
5,Crazy quilts!,"Mama Bear has decided she wants to open her own quilt shop because she loves to make quilts. Plus, she is very creative and tailors each quilt to fit the person. (Brother has an airplane quilt.) This book teaches little ones that you can achieve what you love to do. Just like Mama Bear."
1,"yet another boring, mundane Berenstain book","These books are awful. Why should kids read books about boring everyday happenings? The books have no plot and tend to just end with nothing happening. They cover boring topics like nail-biting and Mama's new job. They are full of sterotypes. Why couldn't Mama be a brain surgeon instead of a quilt-maker? Kids should read exciting books by creative, whimsical authors. Even Pokemon books are better than these stupid books."
4,"Basic, but fun","This is basically 20 questions...but that was a new concept to my four-year-old. He quickly grasped the right questions to ask that would narrow the options at the beginning of the game, which actually made him not want to play it more than a few times in a row because it got a little monotonous. However, we have owned the game for a year now and it still gets played fairly regularly, which definitely makes it a four-star game in my opinion!"
1,can find info on the internet..,"This book didn't share any new information. In fact, virtually everything in the book can be found by just doing a Google search.."
1,poor quality,tho the product was used I was not aware it gets stuck at thebeginning or end of each track therefore I have to be right there to change it every time. I was disappointed.I would have purchased a new one if I had none of this problem
3,CD or 45?,"This cd sounds like a 45 with very bad sound quality. I would still buy it because ""Lonely Weekend"" is a hard to find song."
1,The genesis of an american heresy,"This writing introduced the belief that the gifts stopped with the apostles. It is heresy and there is no scriptural support for this concept of Warfield. Unfortunately, many Christians & denominations have bought into this lie because of this book. If you want insight into the rejection of the supernatural work of God, for today, and how it was mainstreamed in the US this is a good read. My 1 star is for false teaching though a powerful writing, obviously."
4,"An intellectualy challenging, well-made case","In this book, B.B. Warfield, a conservative theologian at Princeton who died in the early 19th century, makes an good case for the cessation of the charismata (Greek for ""spiritual gifts""). This is a classic, and a must read for those interested in the topic. The book is a fairly difficult read, given the way Warfield skips around from viewpoint to contrasting viewpoint, but it is incredibly interesting and I highly recommend it. I bought mine at a local bookstore, and it cost me $10, so their price looks reasonable."
4,Very Challenging,"B.B. Warfield was widely regarded as the most able conservative theologian of his generation in the English-speaking world. He applies his characteristic Biblical thoroughness and clear-headed rigor to this topic, with very challenging results. He changed my mind on several issues he addresses. Overall, very good."
1,Formatting for Kindle?,"DO not buy the 7.99 kindle edition, it is NOT formatted correctly, i will have a very difficult time reading this book now, i would like to have a refund and try the 3.99 version( i did not see that version, if it works please respond and let me know) no table of contents, you have to zoom just to read the print, and you must read it with the device turned sideways!"
1,NORDICTRACK CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!!,"BEWARE OF BUYING ANY NORDICTRACK PRODUCTS!!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REPAIR DEPARTMENT ARE SIMPLY AWFUL. THEY ARE NOT HELPFUL, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR EQUIPMENT PROBLEM, THEY TELL YOU A PART IS ORDERED WHEN IT'S NOT, WHEN YOU CALL TO SEE WHERE IT'S AT, THE PART IS SUDDENLY ON BACKORDER, ETC. MY NORDICTRACK HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY LIVING ROOM FOR A MONTH UNUSABLE WITH NO END TO THIS NIGHTMARE. DO NOT BUY NORDICTRACK PRODUCTS!!!"
4,Where's the end ?,The book was AMAZING in the beginning and middle but the ending was not all that great in my opinion
4,Red Light,Great book - a fast read that kept me on my toes guessing what was coming next - look forward to reading more of the same
5,Absolutely positively fabulous,"A sergeant in the Orange County Sheriff's Department, MerciRayborn is a dedicated law enforcement official. She is an honorableperson who believes her calling is to apprehend and bring criminals to justice. Although two long years have passed since a psychopath killed her partner and lover Tim Hess, Merci remains consumed with anger and guilt because he died protecting her... Jefferson Parker has written one of the better police procedurals of the first year in the new millennium. Fans of Ridley Pearson and Linda Fairstein will fully enjoy RED LIGHT because it is a novel that has as much heart as it does action. The heroine is a sympathetic character driven by emotional needs that the audience understands and empathizes with even though they will question some of her actions. The rich sub-plots add complexity to the fast-paced main story line. On a score from a high five to a low one, this book is a strong six.Harriet Klausner"
5,Red Light (Merci Rayborn),I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline in the book. It captivated me from the start. Great read. Kept me ups nights trying to read it all at once.
3,Just ok,"This one was not nearly as good as The Blue Hour, but still held my interest. It just wasn't the page turner I had expected."
3,Strong start-weak finish,One never really warms up to the main character so it's difficult to feel upset when things don't work out for her.
5,MERCILESS MERCI,"Parker picks up with Merci Rayborn from BLUE HOUR and thrusts her into the RED LIGHT. Parker is a marvelous writer, deft at both plotting and character development. And while I agree he's ""somewhat softened"" Merci, I still find her hard to like a hundred percent..and that's good in a way. What she does to Mike McNally in this book only accentuates her driven psyche...she even seduces Mike to gain evidence against him. Then she asks for his forgiveness. It's a shame, I think. I like Mike's character, and his involvement with the prostitute only proved that Merci was neglecting him in a big way. You can have friendship with a member of the opposite sex, and if he found himself ""falling"" for her, he realized that she was no good for him, and he was never unfaithful to Merci.Back to the plot, though. Parker interweaves the two seemingly disparate cases together to come up with a somewhat surprising solution to the murders.A complex, gritty novel."
1,Preposterous!,"I understand this is fiction but I have never read such an absurd crime novel. It is a bit hard to believe that practically all the higher ups in the department for the previous generations are corrupt. And to even involve her father in the scheme. PLEASE! I was waiting for her toddler to somehow be involved as well. This was my second, and last, Parker read. What a disappointment."
2,A book to put you to sleep,"The book opening story line of a murder, including the victim, the suspect, and the police investigator are all interesting and promise a good story. But readingt it thereafter, I quickly found it tedious and boring. If you have difficulty falling asleep, takes this book to bed with you. My problem with this author is his inconsistency. I have found his books to be hit and miss affairs. Some are really good reading while others simply are not and this is one of the latter."
3,NOT THE SAME WITHOUT HESS,I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS THE LACK OF HESS OR THE READER BUT THIS ONE JUST DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT.
3,worth a read.....,I guess it speaks well to the talent of Mr. Parker that even though his heroine is not warm or very likeable he still manages to engross you completely in the plot. Read and enjoy this book for the mystery and prose as there is not any characters you will feel drawn to.Ree-views
3,Merci Rayborn is no Kay Scarpetta,"On the whole the Red Light is a good read.However, the plot took too long to develop. Also suspense was lacking, given that most of the book was dedicated to Merci's musings.The unforeseen climax at the end is worth the time.I would advise against buying the book(since it isn't close to classic), but rather would suggest borrowing it from the library.ATTENTION: Red Light is not for people with short attention spans."
3,TOO LITE,"Although I have enjoyed Parkers books in the past, I found this one to be a bit muddled and the plot convoluted. I loved BLUE LIGHT because of Tim Hess. I cannot stand Merci as the main character in this tome. The story takes far too long to get going and never gets inside the criminals mind like Parkers other books. Skip this one and read BLUE LIGHT."
4,Smashing!,"What can i say? this song has it all. if you like country, youll love this cd. i know i do. and all these great songs for a low low low price like that. why buy all the other cds when you just want the hits. heres the hits, and none of that other garbage. you got it all!"
1,Not the Original Artists,This is Terrible. The music samples posted on Amazon sounded like the original artists but the CD definitely does not!
5,Yoga Nidra,"Having only recently learned of Yoga Nidra, I have tried several different CD's. This one was not my favorite but don't let that detour you if you are looking for a way to meditate for relaxation."
5,An excellent intro to Yoga Nidra,"Having never done any Yoga Nidra practices before, I was looking forward to this CD and after using it for a month or so, am very happy with my purchase. Yes the cons are there - the accent is a bit distracting, and the pacing is a bit quick at times, but once you get used to it after listening to the CD a few times, those are minor issues that one can easily overcome. I normally listen to the CD late afternoon after a long day and have always found it extremely refreshing and energizing, and more importantly, feeling more peaceful and relaxed afterwards. A few times, I actually fell asleep during the session probably for 5-10minutes in between- I am not sure if that is meant to happen, but this rare for normally I can't take even short naps during the day. So far, I don't notice much difference to me when I am doing the short or long version, but am looking forward to seeing how this could bring me more at peace if practiced daily going forward."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"In the first part the mooing cows and other farm animals were too loud and distracting. I love animals, but there was too much of it and I couldn't enjoy it. I agree with another reviewer that it made me laugh, but it was because it was silly; not because I felt exhilarated. Swami talks too fast. The second part had beautiful music. The third part was similar to the first, but longer and not so many animal sounds. I can't say I was impressed with this CD. I returned it for a refund. I love relaxation tapes and usually make my own."
1,annoying yoga nidra,Do not waste your money on this cd. Yuck!! I heard that this was a great cd but he never stops talking and the barn animal noises are too much. Then there is singing and groups of people talking that you can kind of hear but can't understand while the singing is going on and he is still guiding you in the nidra. Perhaps others have never done a real Yoga Nidra. This is a joke The short version he is talking with a stream in the back ground then all of a sudden the voice is louder and the stream is gone it jolts you out of any relaxation you might have had. Bad choice
5,Good yoga nidra CD,"I like this yoga nidra CD. It's useful for relaxing and attaining deeper states of consciousness. It can also be used as a type of self hypnosis to modify your habits. In some ways, its like a guided meditation."
3,Yoga Nidra CD,"I was reading Martha Beck's book Steering by Starlight and she recommended Yoga Nidra, so I looked at this one and another, on Amazon and decided on this one. It doesn't seem to be any better or worse than any other guided imagery relaxation tapes. I must not be too impressed because I've only used it three times."
4,Happy with content,"The DVD was excellent, but it arrived with a broken case, so really my gripe is with Amazon. They should have packaged it better. I love the Yoga Nidra though!"
2,Get the Jap version on this one really!!!,"You will notice during the show there will some music playing in the background but no singing. In the Jap version they had original music by artists that contributed in the show, but in the english it was mute but only the music went on. The Theme songs are still the same dumb english version when the jap version changes theme intro and song. This version is also has alot of bad dubbing. The only english versions worth watching was episodes 1-12."
5,Blow Out In Hell aka: Blown To Hell,"This tape runs approx 150 minutes.Program copyright 2002 Robert Black.Distributed by Goldhil Video, Thousand Oaks CA 91360Spine #GH780Tis tape is exactly the same as the DVD titled Blown To Hell.Nothing less. Nothing more.One of XPWs most exciting matches, the Exploding Death Match"
1,BAD BAD BAD VACUUM,I bought this for about $170.00 one a year ago. The only way I can make it pick up dirt is to get on my hands and knees and use the hose by hand. This gets frustrating because the hose comes unattached every minute or so. Im very tired of buying vacuums that end up in the land fill after only a year. This vacuum should not ever be on the market... BUYER BEWARE.
1,Don't do it - the worst vacuum ever!!!,"This vacuum is such a waste of money. I spent over $100 on this and it worked good for 2 uses. And I only have one medium area rug and a small rug on my back porch and no pets! The filters and the hoses get clogged easily. You have to constantly clean the filters to get a minimal amount of suction. When you empty out the container, the dust flies everywhere even if you do it slow. When you vacuum, all the dust and dirt shoots out of the back of the vacuum cleaner and hits your feet. What a joke. I finally purchased a great vacuum from Eureka (4870dt). Now my rug is clean again! I am putting this thing in a garage sale! This is the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever used. I will never buy a Hoover again!"
1,Horrible product,"This is the worst vacuume cleaner I have ever used. Instead of picking up, it just moves things around. And never lift the vacuume while running or you will get pelted with flying debris. Even after cleaning the filters after EVERY use, the thing still fails to clean the carpet adequately. The extention hose and wand are hard to use, because the hose is too short for both extentions, you therefore have to pick up and hold the vacuume with one hand, while using the wand with the other. Emptying the dirt chamber is a huge mess! I returned mine."
1,Don't Buy this Vacuum!,"This vacuum was a major disappointment. ... I was hoping by going with Hoover again I would get another great product. Boy was I wrong!! The dirt cup on this vacuum needs to be emptied often, at least every time I vacuum and sometimes more. The suction is horrible. Lots of dirt gets left behind. It smells like rubber is burning every time I use it. The cord is way too short so I am constantly changing outlets. I am going back to a bagged vacuum. TRUST ME, DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM!!!"
2,I Thought I Had A Deal,"The thought of not having to buy bags for a vacum cleaner is what turned me on to this Hoover. Save some money and cut down on the dust and allergens seemed like a good thing to me. I used it for about a month and the belt broke, so I had to buy a new one. Now I can't find filters for it! Take my advice find out about where to get your filters, belts, or whatever it is you need for your vacum before you buy it!"
5,We all love this game!,"We bought this game for our kids last Christmas (2010). They were 2 & 4 at the time. It was a bit too hard for them to set up on their own, but the game is enough fun that my husband and I enjoy it as well.Now that they are 3 & 5, my five year old can set it up on his own.This is their favorite game and the first that they reach for. It's challenging yet fun and the quality is great. I would recommend this to a friend, especially if they need a game that is interesting for a large span of ages and doesn't take too long to play."
3,Sufficient,"It took two sticks of honey to sweeten a bitter black tea. I prefer the Ahava honey sticks to these. They are sweeter, and you don't have to use as many. Aside from that, the flavor was excellent once I used enough."
5,"GREAT for children and parents, helps make relocating easier","This book is just what children need. In the hustle and bustle of today's nomadic families, the children's needs and feelings sometimes get lost in the shuffle. Adults sometimes forget the fears that children have about making new friends, and I think this book helps solve some of those fears and questions through a brilliant use of simplicity...Just follow the RECIPE! The colorful illustrations catch the readers eye as the story moves you through the process of a young boy and his frog following the ""recipe for friends!"" I love this book and my children have a ball looking at the pictures over and over again."
1,Cheaply Made,"I was not impressed at all with this replica stadium and returned it. It is smaller than the dimensions given. I thought it was hand painted but there were stickers used for the field and the signs, and they were put on crooked. Definitely not worth the money."
2,Disappointing,"I must say, I was intrigued by the title and ready to read some fantastic accounts of a veteran traveller to exotic, unexplored places...but it reads more like a series of ""Top Ten lists"" saying, ""this is so crazy"", ""this is so dirty""! Really not recommended for anyone who has lived abroad, or had experience in other countries. More for college kids who want to spend a summer or year after their studies hanging out with other ex-pats in tourisy places, saying, ""Wow man, things are really cheap in Thailand!"""
4,This is a parent trap,"Stacey thinks that Mr. Brook is the one for her mom. But his daughter Joni does not think so. She is a real pest but its just because she doesn't want her dad to remarry. But Mr. Brook is too harsh on Joni even though she's annoying and Stacey's mom doesn't think that is fair to Joni so they break up. At first Stacey is upset but then she realizes what's best for her mom. So maybe her mom will find another guy. She sure is dead-set on getting her mom another husband, and getting herself a stepdad."
3,Not really that good.,"I don't really like this book because Stacey didn't matchmake---her mother and John (the guy who Stace thinks is perfect for her mom) did all the work. But I was amused by the way Joni tried to ruin her father and Stacey's mother's relationship. I can't wait to read The All-New Mallory Pike. She is a really crucial character and I'll miss her because we're a lot alike. I think it's also about time Jessi got another book. Book #127 is Abby's Un-Valentine. Abby again? What happened to Jessi? She hasn't spoken in over ten books! ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT JESSI, QUICK!"
1,Factually Flawed Novel,"Here are two facts: (1) the first successful bone marrow transplant was in 1959 and (2) ""The Man from LaMancha"" was first produced on Broadway in 1965.Roy Cohn's role in this novel occurred prior to these dates.Why is this important? Because one of the central characters, Bo, has a successful bone marrow transplant. And people are singing songs from a musical that did not exist.So no matter how brilliantly this is written, a novelist who is writing something call historical fiction--references to actual events in history--has a responsibility to be accurate with the history."
4,cool track,"this track has truly grown on me over time&MJ truly knocks it out with His Phrasing.together with R.Kelly,MJ brings another cool cut.the Re-Mixes are cool as well.glad to see two Great Musical Giants dropping another track together."
5,A good brush,"The Robert Simmons white sable brushes are very nice brushes. I have some. I wish I had all the sizes and types. I am only a hobby artist, but really enjoy the price, feel and performance of these RS brushes. Considering the price and performance, one could pay a whole bunch more and not get that much better performance."
1,Warning .. no replacement parts,"Product functions ok but don't try and get a replacement Oak strip, gaskets and bolts.CS responds promptly to emails but could have saved the phone call. Sorry Charlie ."
4,Celestial take on Byzantine chant.,"Those who are used to hearing full Russian choirs sing the music of the Orthodox Church will be pleased to hear a single voice featured in this recording- and a beautiful one at that- with minimal choral backup. The added voices are never a distraction. Coming from the Serbian tradition, this artist sings mostly in Church Slavonic, but a southern Slavic take on Greek, Russian and Serbian Orthodox chants is refreshing and enlightening. I withhold one star for the decision to include the audience's applause from this live concert recording- it really intrudes."
1,Headphone jack on bottom - Proprietary battery,"OK, first I want to talk to the genious who put the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone. You have to remove your headset to put the phone in the charger. Are you kidding me? At more that 3X the price of other brands, I expected a high quality phone but got this piece of junk instead. The description leads you to believe the case is ruggedized with rubber. Not so, there's a thin band of rubber on the edges only - other than that it's plastic everwhere. It also claims to be water and dust resitant. How is that possible with a cheap plastic back cover with a 1"" hole and no gasket? The voice quality is tinny when using the phone's speaker. There is a annoying delay when pressing buttons and the phone keeps ringing when you pick up an extension for a few seconds. And worst of all, it uses a proprietary battery. If you must have a Siemens phone get the S series that uses rechargeable AA batteries."
3,Great defective phone.,"We received the phone in great time. The phone is overall EXCELLENT. The only problem we had is that we received a deffective phone. It took approx. 10 tries to dial out. Then using the caller ID or phone book, you couldn't ""quick dial"" those numbers. Other than that, the RANGE of the phone was VERY impressive. I just wish we would've gotten a good phone to begin with."
2,So so phone.,"It's a nice phone and all but it's not for me. The phone is way to slow. For example when you're in a call and you have to dial in more numbers for any reason, it tends to skip a few."
1,BAD BUY,I am very disappointed in this phone. Like the other review the clock is very slow and does not update automatically from caller ID - something $5 phones do.I wasted money on several of these and the caller ID and rings takes seconds to reach all of them.The menu system appears to be beta with no ability to preempt an action by pressing a dedicated button.It also cannot do a correct caller ID parse of the area code (1)to the directory and caller numbering rules for the US were set decades ago and my old Siemens phone workedI am currently dealing with moronic customer support at Siemens and trying to get my money back or at least an exchange for a completed product.I liked my 10 year old Gigaset a lot but it suffers too much interferenceDon't buy
1,Do not buy this item from Amazon. They ship it via DHL.,"The item itself is not a problem, buying it from Amazon and getting it shipped via DHL is the problem. Until Amazon agrees to use another carrier, I would stay away. Any electronic item shipped via DHL will breakdown because of the way DHL delivery people mistreat packages."
5,Great Fortune Telling Book!,I have loved this method of fortune telling for years. But I have never been so delighted as the day I found this wonderful hard cover book version with all the meanings to the cards written in it and a delightfully artistic game board included. The board is too nice to use! My original softcover game was wearing out so I bought this to replace it. It's beautifully done and makes a wonderful way to preserve this accurate method of reading the cards. I love this card reading method. It's the best one out there! Forget tarot! You need this!
4,Highly Accurate,"This ""game"" is easy to read and highly accurate. It even comes with a game-board to lay the cards and predict your next 30 days. A must have for beginners and advanced card readers."
2,Too generalized and not accurate!,I bought this game based upon the reviews. This is a book and game where you lay regular playing cards on a mat and then read the book to interpret what will happen that month. It was soooooo wrong for me it wasn't even funny. I ended up selling the item.
4,Gong Hee Fot Choy Book & game board,"Great book, but I was disappointed that it didn't come with a game board. I must of misunderstand when ordering thinking it was the book & game board! But still, I do recommend ordering from Amazon, because they are very prompt."
1,Never Received,"I ordered this book in early December and I never receieved it... I wasn't even sent a tracking number. I wanted to give it to my cousin for an upcoming exam, and I still can't get it to him."
2,Kind of boring.,William Shatner's narrative is not that impressive. It seems a bit like he is showing off his knowledge too much or maybe he doesn't like doing this gig or something. VHS quality doesn't help. I like the subject matter but this one is not my favorite.
3,For the serious Shatner fan only.,"This is essentially an alternate version of Chariots Of The Gods with William Shatner hosting (think Leonard Nimoy-style ""In Search Of..."" complete with mock sincerity).I like it because of it's sheer cheesiness and unintentional camp humor.If you laugh at Ancient Aliens and enjoy 70's docs than this is for you, otherwise I'd steer clear!"
3,A little Wacky but Fun,I like all the von Daniken work and this video features a very young William Shatner which makes the purchase price worth it for this fact alone! It's a bit staged and silly but still good. I am not disappointed at all.
5,beautiful ring,This ring is beautiful and just what I was looking for. I have looked for a long time for a ring with citrine and garnet together in white gold or sterling silver. My husband's birthstone is garnet and mine is citrine. This ring and shape is perfect - now our HEARTS will always be together.
2,Frustrating for new users,"Although the author writes well and obviously knows his stuff, he seems to have totally forgotten what it's like to be a beginner. I frequently found myself scratching my head, wondering ""Did I miss something?"" Two examples: To do most things in Photoshop you have to select, but this topic doesn't even arise until chapter 6! Similarly, layers are crucial, and yet there's no basic explanation of how to use them. (The book directs you to the publisher's Web site for a tutorial on layers, but it's nowhere to be found on the site map or via a search. Feeling stupid, I bought the ""Dummies"" Photoshop book. Even though I hate that title, and the constant cornball humor is distracting--at least things are clear. Voila! I can do something after all. Even though this book is marketed to beginners, a giant thumbs down from this one."
3,Wish for a little more,"My 4 year old daughter was so excited to receive this for XMAS. However, she only played with it for an hour or two and it hasn't been played with since. The dance floor is cool but that is pretty much all it does. The swing is not worthwhile as the pony falls off as soon as you try to swing. I also wish that it came with more than one pony. Buy this only if it is on sale or you have another Ponyville set so your child can use it to make a pony ""village."""
4,Great Toy,"I grew up with My Little Pony, so I'm happy to buy them for my 4 and a half year old now. This Teapot Palace is a great toy. It is large, and I am surprised it only came with one pony. I gave it 4 stars for the fact that the plates and cups are teeny weeny. ZThey are easily lost, and they hurt very bad when you step on them. I know from experience. :)The door also doesn't close all the way like its supposed to."
5,The best birthday gift,I gave this to my granddaughter for her 5th birthday and she said this was her favorite of all the gifts she received.
1,Perfect gift for serial regifters!,Super dull book for the people who gave me a broken food processor with chunks of food left in it last year! Wraps up nicely and looks like a real gift but easy on the wallet. I think they'll get the hint and just forego the gift exchange next year.The Everything Toasts Book (Everything (Reference))
1,Hoover Windtunnel V2 poor performer,"Purchased five months ago, 08/25/2002. Have a dog with medium length hair and a wife that sews occasionally. Hair and thread wrap around the cheap and poorly engineered plastic bushings designed to protect agitator bearings from wearing and debris. Bushings have dissolved away and agitators no longer spin. You would be wise and buy a better designed brand or be prepared to disassemble and clean bushing and bearings frequently...A useless vacuum to me and only for dust pick-up."
1,Lots of power but breaks easily,"I bought this vacuum less than a year ago and have had nothing but problems with it. It picks up great, but is very heavy to push around. After about 3 months of use the foot lever to rotate the vacuum down broke and cannot be fixed as it has a plastic spring. The door to the tools accessories will not stay shut and constantly flops down. And recently both the rollers melted where they connect to the frame. My mother also owns this vacuum and has had numerous problems with hers also. I took the vacuum back to my local store where it was purchased and they graciously let me exchange it (even though it was almost a year old) for a new dyson vacuum and approximately the same cost. The new dyson is everything a vacuum should be and more. I have written a review on the Dyson because I am thrilled with it as so many others seem to be. Do not buy the hoover vacuum, you will be sorry."
1,Waste of money,"This vacuum worked great at first, but it is now just over one year old and I'm ready to throw it in the trash. Hoover service told me it needs a new motor, gears, height adjuster and brushes (This is the second set of brushes). I reluctantly agreed to have them fix it, and after weeks of waiting they tell me its ready. All they have done is replace the brushes and charge me $30 for labor to install them. I could have done that myself in 5 minutes. It still runs for a few minutes, gets hot, starts to smell and shuts down. This vacuum has only received moderate use for one year. My old fashioned hoover ran fine for ten years, and was still fine when I gave it away. This machine is not anywhere near the same quality. I'm not going to waste another dime on it. Avoid this expensive piece of junk."
2,don't buy this one!,I have had this for a little over a year and it started out fine. Was supposed to be a high quality model when I got it. Within 6 months of very moderate used the beater brushes stopped turning. The little motor that turns the brushes is dead and they were not always used since i would turn them off when doing the linoleum and hardwood floors. I would estimate they had maybe 10 actual operating hours on the motor. To get it repaired was going to cost over $100. It was a gift so I didn't have a store receipt so warranty is useless because they don't know when the 'year' started. It had not been manufactured for a year yet but that doesn't matter apparently. What a disappointment
2,"WOULD LOVE TO GIVE IT GOOD REVIEW, BUT","I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BACK IN NOVEMBER OF 2002 AND IT'S NOW MARCH OF 2003 THE MOTOR HAS GONE OUT IN IT......WHICH TO ME FOR THE AMOUNT I PAID IT SHOULD LAST ALOT LONGER THEN 4 MONTHS NOT HAPPY AT ALL ABOUT THAT AND 1 MONTH AFTER I PURCHASED IT I LOST THE USE OF THE NICE POWER ATTATCHMENT GREEN, SO ALL IN ALL THIS WAS A BUST MACHINE FOR ME.....SO NOW I HAVE TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO GET IT ALL REPLACED....THE ONLY SMART THING I DID WAS PURCHASE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, SO PERHAPS IT'LL ALL BE TAKIN' CARE OF......THANKS.."
2,Great suction bad design,"Like another said, it has issues. It has the best suction of any vac I've ever owned. I love the bagless, and it has a large collection cup on it, plus no belt is a plus. Unfortunately, one of the dual motors just died on me, which is why I am here shopping for another vac. But before it died on me, one side was always getting clogged up, which was annoying. I used the crevice tool to vac out the clog from the bottom, rather than a coat hanger (I tried that too.) Another issue is the hose attachment, which pulls out easily, and is hard to put back without using a screw driver. Trying to get it to stay is impossible, and I ended up taping it up. Also the upholstery attachement with the agitators no longer works, and the plastic cover where the attachments are won't stay close. Duct taped that too. For what I paid for it, I expected it to last a lot longer. I was very disappointed with it. Think I will just buy the cheap vacs from now on."
1,"Have a pet, don't buy this vacuum!","Bought it because of the two brush design. Hand tool failed after the second use and had to completely disassemble it to remove the hair that stopped the brush from rotating. Two months in, the pet hair wrapped around the spindle and starting to heat the roller brush and melted/stripped one roller. Took it into the Hoover dealer to get it repaired and he indicated that this was the most returned vacuum he had seen in a long time. That was allI needed as I quickly returned it to the store for a refund. For the price, it's nothing but a huge piece of junk."
1,Do not purchase if you own Pets !,"Do not buy this vacuum if you own Pets !We purchased it two months ago. We liked it very much until we found out that Dog hair (2 Labs) becomes tangled in the roller brush mechanism between the mechnical drive spline and the roller brush. Three of the four rollers have melted where they attach to the mechanical drive due to the dog hair heating up and melting the plastic. We had another Windtunnel for 6 years with no problem. This new V2 has a major design flaw. We are returning it ASAP and need to look at a different design. If you have pets, take it apart and see if yours is melting as well. I consider it a major safety concern and have written the company."
1,The Honeymoon is Over,"I had a windtunnel with a bag before and had a good experience with it. This bagless has been frustrating to say the least. At first it worked great and picked up an amazing amount of pet hair (3 dogs) and dirt out of the carpet routinely. However after a few months it started clogging up with pet hair such that I had to bang on each clear plastic tunnel several times while vacuuming each room to dislodge the clogs. I've never had to do that before. Then the end of the hose that goes into the machine started coming out repeatedly. I've never had that happen before either. The other day the brushes on one side just stopped turning. I took the thing apart, cleaned it, and it still did nothing. Thanks to the other reviewers I will trash this one and not bother with ordering the metal brushes or professional repair. Just take my loss, learn my lesson, and move on."
1,I HATE THIS VACUUM,This vacuum was a waste of a lot of money. The wheels underneath it broke off two weeks after we bought it. The hand tool quit working and the lever that adjusts the carpet level broke. Do not buy this vacuum.
1,Fell apart after one month!!!!!!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner one month ago after doing alot of research. At first it was great. It vacuumed really well. THe powered handtool is absolutely useless though. Then about 2 weeks ago the release lever (the one that holds it upright that you release to vacuum) broke and now I have to lean it against the wall when I'm not using it. Then today, the small wheel under the front of the vacuum broke off. Now I can't use it at all. This was way too much money for it to fall apart with in one month!! I will never buy another hoover, I should have known better."
4,Cool enough cleaner!,It is very good and convenient...only drawback I could see so far is that lots of dust (lint) gets stuck in the roller!
1,dissatisfied hoover user,I PURCHASED THIS VACCUM LESS THAN A YEAR AGAO-I HAD HEARD VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SWEEPER. AT FIRST I WAS VERY PLEASED BUT THAT LASTED ABOUT A WEEK. THE CLEAR VACCUM TRACKS BECAME CLOGGED VERY QUICKLY AND WITH NO WAY TO REMOVE THE CLOG EXCEPT FOR BANGING IT ON THE FLOOR SEVERAL TIMES TO LOOSEN THE DEBRIS. DUE TO THE CLOG THEN IT OVERHEATED WHICH IN TURN BLEW THE SAFETY SWITCH ON IT. THIS WOULD HAPPEN WITH EACH USE. NOT TO MENTION THSI SWEEPER IS VERY HEAVY AND FORGET ABOUT STEPS-IT IS TOO BULKY AND HEAVY TO MANOVER-CONTACTED HOOEVER THEY WANT ME TO DRIVER 3HOURS TO A SERVICE CENTER TO LEAVE IT THERE FOR REPAIRS OR TAKE TO A REPAIR MAN NOT COVERED BY HOOVER AND PAY FOR IT MY SELF AND WAIT TO BE REIMBURSED. YEAH LIKE THAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER BEENING ON HOLD FOR 30MINUTED LONG DISTANCE-THIS SWEEPR IS IN THE YARD SALE TOMORROW!! NO MORE HOOVER-FOR THE MONEY SPENT I SHOULD HAVE SPENT ANOTHER 100 AND GOTTEN AN ORECK-NOW THATS A SWEEPER
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!!!!,"Its heavy and loud. You might be okay if you dont have kids, animals and a head of hair. It gets clogged and you have to take the whole vacuum apart to unclog. Than it just clogs again. And hair get wrapped around the bearings on the brushes and then melts and fuses the bearing together than you have a wonderful option of paying 90 bucks to have it fixed or just throw the junk away!!! Dont buy this vacuum!!! And if you write Hoover with your problem, they will not respond!!"
3,Tight fit,"I have really small fingers, but their even medium is still pretty tight. If you don't have really small fingers like a young Korean boy, you'll probably want to get the large. Doesn't pluck well on nylon either. These are strictly steel string."
3,"Loved them at first, but then they stretched out","I'm a bare fingerpicker who is trying to learn to use picks to get more volume. I've tried several kinds, and at first I loved the Alaska Picks as they gave me the sense of still being able to know where I am in relation to the strings (which I had trouble doing with Dunlops). But after a few weeks, they began to stretch out a bit and not fit my fingers as well as they did at first. Also, they have to fit under the nail, and I keep my nails short since I work on a computer all day, so I'm not into the classical deal where you let your nails grow. Nails break too. They're a good idea but in the end I chose the Fred Kelly Freedom Picks. Your mileage may vary."
1,Waste of time--don't bother,"Sorry guys, this is not the holy grail. The picks fall off immediately and they also have a tourniquet effect---so when they do fall off, it's a releif. If you want long strong nails, have your local nail place put on acrylic nails--the tone is best if they don't put the plastic under the acrylic; but then the nails break easier. I find it a little uncomfortable getting my nails done, especially if it's a dude doing it-----but, it is absolutly worth it when you hear what you can do on the instrument---no finger pick for nylon strings can ever match that function."
4,very good for someone used to playing with nails.,"If you're used to playing with nails, Alaska piks are one of the only options. They're a bit goofy looking, but really do work well and sound great.Also, if you like flatpick/strum with your fingernail (as I do) then Alaska Pik's are the ONLY fingerpick I know that works like your fingernail that way.You do need to order them on the smaller side - which is a bit uncomfortable - if you play hard and want to keep them on."
3,I will keep trying.,I don't like using fingerpicks period and had hoped these might change my mind...so far that has not happened. They are closer to working like your natural nails but I have not found a comfortable way to use them yet....I am willing to keep trying and if I find that way will re-post with an update.
5,The Coach I've Been Looking For,"The workouts are challenging, but they are very specific and will help you achieve your goals! :) A timeless treasure worth much more than it's selling for these days. I have friends ask me for advice from this book all the time. It's that good!"
1,Leaks Like A sieve - Buy something else!!!,"I don't often get as angry at an inanimate object as I did at this P.O.C. Only the second time I used the machine, and when I attempted to mount the clean water tank/soap dipanser the clean water just rushed out the bottom of the tank and sturated my carpet in several areas. I've read other reviews on this product which state that the clean water tank cracks and causes the leak.So tonight I'll inspect the clear water tank to see if it is cracked because I suspect it is another problem. If I find out exactly what is the problem I will post the answer on this review board."
1,One of the worst products I have ever seen,"The V2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about $250. Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality."
4,Good for small jobs,"If you are cleaning your entire house, consider a professional. But for spot cleaning, or cleaning one room, it is great. The problem is it uses a lot of water, so large jobs will require long time and frequent stops to empty the dirty water and refill with clean water. I used it in an area that had pet stains from my cat marking the carpet, and it did a great job."
1,FILL TANK LEAKS - 4 th TANK,"The plastic tank is designed too thin. The rubber check valve push's on the plastic bottom of the fill tank when it's put on the machine. Hoover knows all about the problem, but it will cut into their profit if they make a stronger tank. This is one product that you have to buy the extended warranty. And ask them to keep those tanks coming."
1,Quality of Steam Vac,"The first time that I tried to use the machine, it leaked almost all of the cleaning detergent onto the floor. I got about 24 square feet done and had about 4oz. of cleaner left in the resevoir. After checking very carefully under the tank looking for problems and found none, I continued on with the same results. Needless to say, I was unhappy with the machine and will have to ship it out to a Hoover repair facility and let them take it apart and look for the problem. The machine did clean very good and was not as loud as I had assumed. Except for the leak and the inconvenience, it cleaned very well. Watch out for leaks!!!!!"
1,Dont waste money on this,"I purchased this steam vac 8 months back. The plastic dispensing tank is too thin or brittle at the corner with the dispensing valve. It cracks and breaks and leaks. I have replaced this couple of times. It makes carpet really messy.This is my kind advice to you all!!Updated -- 11/30/04Finally, Hoover has made design modifications to the tank and sent me another one. This one works fine.."
1,Don't Buy It.,"I usually wouldn't take the time to write a review of a product, but I'd like to save other people from going through the same difficulty I have.The Hoover V2 seemed to be a good carpet cleaner. It received good reviews from Consumer Reports. Unfortunately, however, the CR reviews do not take the machine's durability into consideration. After 3 uses, the clean water tank cracked. The valves at the bottom of the clean water tank conceal the problem. However, upon removing them, you can see that the EXTREMELY thin plastic forms stress cracks. These cracks grow and multiply across the opening for the valve until one day you notice water pouring from your machine across your carpet.There's no way to correct it or even prevent it. If you use this cleaner enough, you will eventually have cracks in the clean water tank. The replacement tank costs $59 -- 1/4 of what I paid for the cleaner originally. I'm going to check our other products today. I can assure you, it will not be a Hoover."
1,Ready For The Garbage Can,"One year and 2 months the solution bottle can no longer hold solution and the brushes dont work usually, 10 uses and no service centers in NJ!!!!!!!!! and no parts online, GARBAGE!!!!!!!I WAS RIPPED OFFFF"
1,"Why call it a ""steamvac"" when it doesn't heat the water","Just take note of the fact that you need to put in ""hot tap water"" to get any steam out of this thing."
1,Great - but defective...,SteamVac Dual V Model F7220900 could be a great product. Comparing to my old Bissel Big Green Powerbrush machine F7220 cleans and dries my carper much better.What makes it unacceptable is the inferior construction and manufacturing quality of the clean water tank. The plastic this tank is made of is so weak and fragile that it breaks the first time when you fill it with water and insert it into the machine. I tried three machines over the period of two weeks being patient enough because they clean so well. But the tank keeps breaking always in the same place (where the black bottom part is latched to the clear container) and starts leaking.It's a pity that I had to return the machine three times to the store and had to give up on it finally because of this engineering defect in the clean water tank construction.
2,Same leaky problem,"I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one who has a problem with the clean water tank leaking. Hoover replaced the tank--no questions asked--once already (the machine is about six months old). Now, however, it's leaking again. I'm also not convinced that detergent is actually making it into my carpet.It cleans well, but obviously, the problem with the tank leaking is not an isolated one (and yes, I do know how to assemble it correctly, thank you). I'd say give it a try, but don't hesitate to ask Hoover--or the store--to make it right if it doesn't work. And be sure to send in your warranty registration!"
2,It leaked bad!,"I didn't like this machine at all. Although it did clean the carpets reasonably well, it was somewhat heavy and bulky to handle. But the biggest reason that I didn't like it was that it leaked the whole time I was using it. I was worried that it would be a fire hazard because the leaking water was running down in the motor area. Needless to say, I returned it."
1,Clean Water Tank Cracks,"I was foolish enough to beleive that the problems experienced by other Hoover owners were special to them. After a few carpet cleanings, our Hoover Steam Vac V - clean water tank cracked on the bottom where the connection is made for water supply. After so many complaints from unsatisfied customers, why would Hoover continue to sell a product with a faulty part? Answer: They don't care. They assume (probably quite accurately) that most consumers will experience the problems after the warranty period, thus creating new business for themselves. SHAME ON YOU HOOVER!"
1,A big disappointment,"I had high hopes for this product based on the many reviews that I read. However, after only using this product for under 5 minutes, the motor began to smoke. Needless to say, I returned the Steamvac and will think twice before I purchase another Hoover product."
2,It Sucks!,"I have always used Hoover products. This V2 does leak and the brushes do stop working, as everyone has said. We switched to a Dyson vacuum and can't wait for a Dyson steam cleaner. Please don't waste your money on Hoover, but bissell sucks too."
3,Ensure you get the new water tank,"The old water tank leaks after about 3 months of use. So much so, that the vacuum is unusable. Hoover redesigned the tank and is sending out new tanks (3 month wait time). Don't buy this style without ensuring you have the new water tank!!! (12/21/04)"
5,"Works great, and it is easy to load and clean","We have used it for 6 months pretty much every month, mainly the manual attachment for spot treatment (most of the time is from food and drooling from our three Goldens, more recently from not being able to read when our new adoption wants to go out), and it has worked great. Today we did a lot more cleaning throughout the house and I have to say that this machine really works great, even for larger areas.It has a lot of flexibility on the settings (rinse only, shampoo, brushes on/off, and different tools for hand cleaning), and it is easy to clean/load.We also ended up getting the Hoover Premium Pet Formula Carpet/Upholstery Detergent and it has worked well, for older stains we had to pre-treat, and sometimes clean the spot twice.More convenient than rental units at the supermarket, and better than less expensive models we had in the past."
5,Gracious Lord,"One of the best Gospel Albums you will ever hear. First time hearing about this dude, was browsing through other Cd's and His album came up and I thought.. why not give it a try. If you ain't heard it, my word to you would be get it, get it, GET IT!. Some deep lyrical content combined with an anointed voice."
5,Great Album,"This album was very well compiled and I felt his words. He was conveying my thoughts and words in his music. I like his rendition of ""I Can Only Imangine"" you will enjoy his album."
4,Rattie approved!,"I had bought one several months back for my three rats, and decided to get another so I can alternate.Overall quality is good, and fits in my cage perfectly! The bottom-side is very durable, and the top is very plush. The only problem is that rodents are chewers, and will eventually chew away the fabric straps that attach it to the metal clasp, which attaches to the cage.It would've been nice to get to choose the color, but I really like the forest green hammock I was sent.My boys also took to it immediately, which has not happened with the handful of others ive gone thru."
2,Missing Part,It's nice but it came without a corner clip. I would like them to send me the clip that is missing.
2,The book is very pricy.,"I am taking a Spanish Conversation class at a local community college, using this book as the text book.The book is very pricy, for a 300 page paperback text book. I am assuming that the high price is because it has a web site that provides some additional resources.However, most of the items on that web site are locked. I do not know which locked resources are accessible by a student. In addition, to create a student id requires a course code. Neither my teacher nor the school administer has the code.There is a 7 day trail access option to access the locked resource, but that option requires user to provide credit card information.I do not recommend this book to any one, unless it is clear what resources can be accessed by a student or a book owner and the content of the web site has been evaluated."
2,Not worth the money!,"Required textbook for Conversational Spanish class. Must spend extra money to purchase CD's to hear pronunciation. The book ""Basic Spanish For Getting Along"" was also required (same authors). Both books are extremely expensive. I don't feel this book was very helpful but it must be a great moneymaker for someone...."
1,laura,"the book was full of writing and was not like new , i am completly dissatisfied but i dont know how to return things from the internet."
3,Basish Spanish Core Text,"I was somewhat disappointed in the degree of usage the shows. There is a lot more writing in the book than was advertised. Other than that, I am satisfied with the purchase."
5,Bethie's really silly and really fun,"This video is fantastic! My 2 & 4 year olds got it as a gift. I think we have watched it every day since. It makes a great change from Barney. The songs are catchy, clever, and fun to sing along with. My only complaint is that there aren't more Bethie videos out there! If they re-release this one jump on it - your little ones will thank you."
2,Didn't Care For This Book,I found lots of errors in this book. Many dogs and owners are misidentified. I did not find much about this book to be helpful.
5,The best book about tounge diagnosis,The best book about tongue diagnosis. Many examples with diagnosis of western and Chinese medicine. The only missing item - lack in theoretical description.
5,Excellent!,"This book was so wonderful. It was practical and easy to follow and stocked full of hundreds of simple, creative decorating ideas!The reason I think I loved it so much was that her ideas were actually good! She has wonderful ""real life"" decorating sense. Also-for someone like me-a beginner, this book was a God-send.Thank you Donna Babylon!!"
2,More splash on Clutter!,I read this book for hopes on Decorating and felt myself getting closed in with ideas on how to find more room to hide my Stuff! While some of the ideas were great I found most were repeated from chapter to chapter and some ideas were not cost savings. All in all I was not impressed with the ideas to create ledges above my doors and shower to store stuff and to put nick knacks on my window sills. I would of liked to have seen more ideas on making lamps and accesories for our home. Maybe I watch to much HGTV.
1,More Hype than new ideas!,This over hyped book is filled with very few new or fresh ideas. Most of the book filled with bullet point ideas and very little instruction. The book was a good concept but fails to deliver.
4,A beautifully illustrated guidebook.,"This book, which was developed from an exhibition catalogue produced for RIBA, provides many beautiful photographs of antique drawing instruments with a descriptive text. Although the text is divided into thematic chapters (published works, instruments for drawing circles, for measuring, cases of instruments, etc.), the illustrations seem to follow no particular order, and captions are written in the style of antique sale catalogues. The lack of footnotes makes this work less useful for the scholar than the collector, and there is the occasional indication that the author's expertise is based more on an art historical than a practical perspective, but there is a large amount of useful information here; the section on published works is especially well done. A must read for those interested in the history of scientific instruments in general and specialists in the history of technical drawing."
5,AWESOME!,First episode of season 3 definitely blew my mind.The only problem I'm having is waiting for the next episode!
3,Slow moving...,"Not nearly as action-packed as the previous two seasons. So far not as thrilling, more like a soap opera with a zombie theme."
3,"The writers are having characters make dumb choices,for drama's sake.","We are only 6 shows into the new season and the writers are apparently running out of ideas.They are resorting to the old hack tactic of having characters do dumb things to heighten tension.The really bad thing is they do it in such an obvious way,like the prisoners stand off.There is no way a cop would have played it out that way,not even maybe.This is one of the hottest shows on tv ,and this is the job the writers do."
5,Never Miss It!!,"This is my favorite tv series. I rented the first season from the video store. I had never heard of it before. I was hooked instantly. I could hardly stand the wait for season 2.My husband has never been into zombies. I tried to get him to watch the series with me before without prevail; however, he listens to Bob & Tom every day. He came in last week and said, ""I must be missing something...Bob & Tom said 10 million people tuned in to watch the first episode of season 3."" So we spent the whole weekend getting caught up on the past episodes. Guess who's hooked now?It keeps getting better and better!"
5,walking dead,kept hearing about this show and started watching the first season just before 3 began I was hooked now i cant wait for each new episode of season 3.
5,is a really good serie,For me It is the best series at level global has excellent graphs are very real I love this series
5,I love Walking Dead,"This show is great. Has nothing to do with where I got it, just the fact that it is available to watch outside of when it is aired is OK with me!"
5,VERY VERY INTENSE!!!!,"An unbelievable show, I couldn't stop watching it. I cannot wait for the rest of the season in February!! I'm not a big TV show watcher, but this is a must!!!!"
5,What can I say....,"Love it, love it, love it. The last one I purchased ended up being cheaper when it actually shipped. Amazon gave me the difference back. Super cool. This series RULES!!"
5,OMG!,"I can't believe they went on Hiatus? How could they!? I mean they get you all hooked up and then this! Seriously, is not like I'm hooked or anything but can you please hurry back!?"
3,Great show....wish Amazon had closed captions,"I love the Walking Dead & the 3rd season has been fantastic after the second one dragged. But I'm dinging it two stars because Amazon's streaming has sometimes been patchy, & they still, after all this time, do not provide closed captions."
5,My family loves it!,My family is addicted to this series!! We are waiting on pins and needles to see the next season. They just do not come out fast enough for us!
5,Great,"Great. Season was great. Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word."
4,awesome show,"awesome show720p not quite so awesomethis was the so-called hd version, which was only playing in 1280x720 resolution, which feels like a jip because, although it is hd, you can get higher hd elsewhere for the same price."
4,Best Show Ever,"So addicted to this show. Everything about it is great. I can't miss an episode. The acting, the writing and special effects are the best. Makes you want to go out and kill zombies."
5,Awesome Series!,Can't believe they s[plit the season in half and I have to wait until February to see what happens next!
3,waning.....,"this show is seriously in need of some excitement, at the rate its going I;m going to root for the walkers to bite everyone. BORING!"
5,Best Yet,"Best story line . Best ""cliff hangers"".More action. Tense , evocative.Can't wait till the rest of the season three....."
5,Awesome!,Great intense television show! Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Highly recommended to whom ever has watched the last two seasons.
4,Love this show,Love this show and the fact Amazon has it ready for me to watch so quick. This show gets better every season!
5,Great writing and acting makes this a continued hit!,"Season 3 is full of non-stop action, and is just keeping me on the edge of my seat. I can't get enough of this show, and Season 3 has not dissappointed at all!! Highly recommended."
5,Worth every penny,The feed was very good quality. There wasnt any skipping. I was very pleased with my purchase. And i love the amazon instant streaming feature because i dont have cable.
5,Good Stuff...,this season is starting out intense...a lot more action than the second season but still has dramatic and heartfelt moments...so far so good guys
5,Not a Zombie lover but love the show,I originally got into this show because my husband found it on Netflix. He is a hardcore zombie lover but I am not at all. I really got into the second season because of the relationships between the characters and their struggle for normalcy in a non normal setting. Netflix doesn't have Season 3 yet so we had to stay caught up by turning to Amazon
5,I now have Zombie Nightmares,"Woke up in the middle of the night after killing 4 walkers - and then one got me. Pretty amazed that at my age (43) this show can get me startled and wide awake from a deep sleep after having not seen an episode for days. Great actors, great production staff, such an awesome movie."
1,junk,slipping into the dark nest.these stories of undead and the end of the world are junk.its hard to write anything about hopeless crap
1,GARBAGE Service/Never Played,"I spent hours trying to get this video to play, it never went passed 44 seconds. Huge waste of time and money."
1,STILL WAITING FOR COMPLETE THIRD SEASON !!!,"Only giving 1 star because I ordered & paid for the THIRD SEASON early Dec. along with the previous 2 as a Christmas gift. I purchased the DVD knowing that this would be on backorder, but, to date I have not received the DVD nor have I been given an idea as to when to expect it. It would be nice to know when I might receive it.The Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season"
2,In stock?,The desription says Season 3 is in stock. So why can't I watch the first episode. Your wording is a little more than misleading.At least they haven't charged my card yet.
5,Bodacious,Love it. This has been a great season! The governor's eye looks so gross!!!! Go team Dixon!!! I hope Merle isn't the douche he acts to be!
4,Perplexing Stupidity Excused,"Having watched seasons 1-3 within the past 3 weeks, I certainly enjoy the series. However, Season 3 as with the previous two required that I place my brain in zombie mode in order to avoid being overly annoyed by things happening that made absolutely no sense at all! Granted, we're talking about reanimated bodies and by no means do I expect some high degree of consistency, however...--When people have the opportunity to put on riot gear that would potentially save their life...but they DONT!? I get frustrated at the ridiculous level of stupidity.--When they attempt to secure a cell block, place markers indicating the proper direction back, are confronted by zombies in the front, somehow get lost on the way back, and somehow have zombies show up behind them...well yeah...stupidity levels go off the charts.--When Walkers, who hobble and wobble, suddenly become ninja stealth fighters that show up behind someone unnoticed...I notice! :)"
5,Awesome!,"We LOVE this show! We watched this season through instant video, and will definitely be buying the DVD version when it becomes available!"
4,"Series is great, streaming poor on lower speeds.","Thought we'd try out Amazon streaming again after being disappointed a year ago. Netflix and Hulu can stream without stopping but the Amazon video pauses often. We only have a 1Mbps link so most people won't experience this, but if you don't have 2Mbps+, pass on Amazon streaming until they offer better streaming to PCs and PS3."
5,Great Episode very sad overall though,"This episode was extremely sad as two main assets to the group die. Also Andrea is beginning to really like woodsbury and wants to stay against michonne's want to leave. Michonne fiugures out that the governor killed the marines and she wants to leave, but andrea stops her leaving us questioning even more what will happen next episode.Overall a really good episode well worth watching."
5,great show,"great show, excellent story that does not follow any of the current formulas for popular TV...you never know what is going to happen"
5,Enlightening,"Entertaining to the whole family, thought provoking, an insight toStress Management in a Hostile Environment. Thinking outside the box extreme."
5,Great!,Great! Keeps me on the edge. Never know what will happen next! We have watched all 3 seasons and can't wait for the next episode!
4,"Good, but....","I can't say I enjoy this episode as much as the last two, I don't really care for andrea and the episodes about Rick and his group are way more interesting than this one, you know cus rick is a boss ;)"
5,awesome,This is a great way to keep up with cable that I do not subscribe to. I would love to club Zombies
3,HD video but Stereo only??? REALLY BAD!!!,"Ummmmm..... I need surround sound to hear the zombies coming from behind me!!!!!! Dish has HD and 5.1 sound! Why is this in stereo ONLY?!!! Ladies and Gents! for our feature film tonight! STEREO SOUND! I mean come on, REALLY? What am I gonna watch it on? my laptop! IT'S THE WALKING DEAD IN HD!!! If that's all ya got then fine, but I was overnighted a ROKU with 5.1 audio just so I wouldn't miss this show and boom. Great picture but eghh so so sound, nothing that's gonna scare my wife into thinking a zombie just grabbed her! The show so far is FANTASTIC!"
5,Awesome Show,"I just love this show, am so happy that it is back on. First show of the season and it was worth the wait, love it already, lots of action"
3,Lots of filler but cool at the end,"It seems like all of the Walking Dead episodes go like this one: Action at first, useless dialog in between, and really good shocker action at the end. This episode is no different and marks the point where Rick really starts to become the bad guy. Yes there are better episodes, but this is worth the money for sure!"
5,awesome,My family and I love this series ...watched season 1 & 2 on Netflix and were thrilled to find the first half of season 3 on Amazon! Loved it...can't wait till February!
5,We are hooked.,"My son's and I are hooked on this series...never watched it when it ran in real time...but we love the fact that we are able to catch up on Amazon. Now we are counting the days until the series resumes in Feb. Not a series for young kids...however my 13 yr old and 19 yr old both enjoy it. More gruesome than I normally would watch, but I love the actors and am hooked into the story line. Can't wait to see what happens."
3,the show was not clear.,"I was just happy to catch up with the third season - I couldnt find it on netflix, hulu etc. The show was not as good quality /clear as I was expecting."
5,Love it,I never knew zombies could be sooooo interesting. The story & characters are awesome...the writing is fantastic! I highly recommend this series.
5,This Episode Made Me Cry.,"The episode, ""Killer Within"", made me cry. How crazy is that? A series about zombies and I end up sobbing. This season has really amped up the action. Every week you never know what will happen next. Anyone can live, anyone can die! I am a little afraid that the sequences with THE GOVERNOR and his town could possibly slow the pace down but who knows? So far season 3 is on a par with season 1 with non stop surprises at every turn. The idea to have the setting at a maximum security prison was perfect. With all the dark corridors and never ending zombies popping up when you least expect it is brilliant. I hope these kind of thrills and chills keep up throughout the rest of the season."
4,Best season so far,"Season one was good, season two was slow, this season picks up the pace. If you like Zeds this season is for you."
5,The Tension Between the Living and the Dead,"The caption on poster says it all: Fight the Dead; Fear the Living. I've noticed that the group takes the walkers in stride now. No fear, as long as they are not outnumbered, even leaving one stray walker alone. The focus of the show has shifted from fighting the dead, though that is still a big emphasis. Now, it seems that learning to live among the living in peace has become the order of the day. And it's not going real well. I've said it often... this is not my normal genre of show. But something in the first episode captured me and has held me rapt for every show since then... it's not a show about dead people, it's a show about relationships among the living in a world gone mad. If everyone is infected, the situation will probably never change for these folks.That provokes a sort of desperation in their living and clinging to each other. I could go on and on about this show. I don't watch any other show with this type of theme. Nothing compares."
5,One of the best series.,This has to be one of the best series out there. Not for kids and kind of gross but GREAT stories and plot lines.
5,this is a awesome series,i love zombie tv series and this is the only one i have seen before so i like this series alot
5,Great show.,"One of the most creative shows put out in a very long time. Always leaves you hanging, wishing the next episode was ready."
5,Awesome!,The show lives up to the last two seasons. Always keeping you on your toes and surprises you constantly going left when you think they're going right. Awesome!
4,Suspenseful,This season kept me wanting more. The mid season cliff hanger...Arrgghh... can't wait to see what happens. Season 3 is much like season 1 which is excellent mix of story and character development.
5,Great series,"This series is not for everyone, but if you enjoy the post-apocalyptic genre, it's one of the best. It has both high production value and excellent writing. I consider it one of the best series on TV."
4,Great Fun and Gore,Good Sci-Fi. Worth your time and keeps your attention for the most part. Always curious to see whats coming next.
5,The most awesome show of all times,I really like this show and I'm very sad that is going to end... I hope that the comic writer star to get some new ideas about the comic...we want the show come back... excuse my English. ;)
3,Too much inconsistency,"If you like zombies that are inconsistent with their mobility this is for you. I don't particularly like how theWriters take liberty with character inconsistency as well. Sometimes they make it 98% clear that a characterIs going to be eaten by zombies in a cage, but somehow miraculously he shows up again to create havoc .. . no explanation how he survived 12 zombies in a small room,… just that he comes back to create problems.Characters personality constantly change,… story is getting a bit stagnant, and predictable. The writers claimTo fame is they don’t mind killing off anyone. Oh boy."
5,Unexpectedly Entertaining,"To be honest- when all my friends kept saying you HAVE to watch the walking dead.... I was like...Really?? How good can yet ANOTHER zombie show/movie be...never mind a long running series... OK... I was WRONG.... this show is great.... mainly because it isn't really about zombies.... that is just the background to set the stage for how all of the ""living"" interact and react to this apocalypse. Season 3 really starts to develop with two plot lines that eventually intersect...well more like CLASH. The turn over in cast (due to a high death rate) was originally annoying because key characters you liked would die, but new ""survivors"" were constantly introduced. Now you see that all the former cast ""deaths"" have really helped to shape the remaining core characters. I don't want to spoil any plot points here.Definitely suspenseful, intriguing, and makes you look forward to the next episode. Also definitely NOT just another zombie story."
5,Nothing like it on TV,My life is so much better watching this amazing show. The morals and messages are very timely. Don't miss it.
3,Where are the zombies?,There needs to be more emphasis on the zombies and less on the humans. What happened to the days where the zombies were the human's worst fears?
5,Hooked!,"I was told about The Walking Dead a few weeks ago (yes, I tend to get a little behind regarding television lol) and I watched season one and two within about a week and a half. I LOVE IT! I started watching season three on Amazon. This way is muchless expensive and I look forward to it! The Walking Dead is definitely a must see thus far!"
5,Hubby and I are addicted!,This show will suck you in the moment you start watching. We can't get enough and can't wait for the next season on Prime!
3,Want it to be so much more....,Feels like they're stretching out the story line in order to have a longer season to sell more advertising. The first season - awesome. Second season - pretty great. Third season - becoming more and more disappointing. May not even bother to watch the rest.
5,We love The Walking Dead!,This season so far has been a game changer! Can't wait for the story to continue... the end of episode 5 just makes us upset because now we have to wait until Sunday for the next episode! It gets your anxiousness revved up for sure!
4,Best Season By Far,Not even halfway through season three and this is the best season yet. There have been jaw dropping moments in nearly every episode and the return of great characters.
4,Great tv series,"I would have given 5 stars but the audio is only stereo...no 5.1. :-(If you haven't yet, make sure you go back and watch seasons 1 & 2."
5,Awesome!!!!,Love this show! Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Looking forward to the next season. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
5,Wow wow wow,"This show just keeps getting better and better, one of the few shows that improves ... well written and thought out. My favorite weekly must see."
5,Love it,Best show ever!! I would watch it over and over. I'm hooked every second. Will buy the whole season. Perfect.
4,Pretty good,"Just started watching season 1 and 2 of the series on netflix. We were anxious to see season 3. It's tough to wait a whole week to see what happens next, butso far the season is progressing along well. The family is glad I purchased."
5,Our favorite new series,"We got hooked on Walking Dead via NetFlix - we watched all of seasons 1 and 2 in just a few weeks... but Season 3 is already in progress, unavailable on NetFlix and the first 2 episodes were not available on our cable's in-demand selection... so Amazon to the rescue! We used our PlayStation to purchase and view the first 2 episodes of season 3 (and a later one that glitched on cable) - thanks Amazon for getting us our Walking Dead fix!!!"
5,A+ show,"Huge Fan. Never thought i'd like a zombie TV series but the walking dead is great. Stumbled across the first 2 season on Netflix. I could write a 10 page review about how good of a show the series has been and why, but i am lazy; so i'll just say that i can't wait for new episodes to enjoy."
3,Walking Dead 3,Great season this season definitely picked back up after a slow season 2. Can't wait for the season to resume
5,LOVE IT!!,AWESOME!!! AWESOME!!! AWESOME!!! THIS SEASON IS YET ONE OF THE BEST ONES...I AM SO ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW!!! I TRULY RECOMMED WATCHING IT!!!
5,Well-rounded Zombie Series :),I thought I'd just watch a couple episodes and wait for it to show up on Netflix. Watched the whole season...in 2 days!!
3,"Psychologically Realistic, except for...","I like this show, but there is a gaping hole in the representation of human behavior. I'm writing this review specifically to soapbox about it because I think it's important.One kind of character that is missing is the smart, strong, or lucky guy or group who has a bit of economic intelligence. That kind of character is a blessing to find because they're capable of more than what they need to do to survive, and this ""extra"" provides them with something they can trade. In such dire circumstances, nearly everyone who survives would be like that. Walking Dead unfortunately overlooks this and therefore sells short the nature of human intelligence and our fantastic and versatile abilities to cooperate.So watch it with this in mind and you will see how dreary and miserable life would be if we, as individuals, don't exploit our abilities and circumstances to create this ""extra"" that makes us valuable to one another."
3,More complex,"I don't know what to say other than I am still enjoying TWD. I bought season 1 & 2 and love the progression of the characters (even though we lost a few along the way). In this episode we follow Andrea's POV and see that she ""gets rescued"". She meets up with Merle again inside a walled up city patrolled by armed gaurds and ruled by a man called ""Governor"". This might not be the best season but its a change from at every turn they are killing zombies. Ok, we get it, its the Z-pocalypse. It's been a while now so there hasy to be a point things start to ""heal"". I think this season we will see that, also the Governor keeps heads in jars and looks at them from time to time (haha!)."
5,This is an AWESOME show !!!!,This show is very addicting. I love it !!! If you haven't seen this show you are missing out. Watch the series from the beginning though and you will be amazed how addicting it is........
5,I do love it!,Gets better every season. The character development is amazing. I am getting attached to these people more evry episode. Cant wait until episode.
2,Not as good as the previous episodes,"I have to say episode 3 was the first ep to disappoint me in this series, and I actually felt irritated at the end of this episode. I found the story line to be very choppy and forced, and far too predictable, especially with Andrea and Michonne. Andrea's character has stagnated instead of continuing to develop into an interesting person to watch, and Michonne is a clone of the archetypical comic book dark hero, complete with angry scowl and flat personality, who can't even recite her very few poorly written lines without sounding forced and stilted. Get rid of that character, she doesn't actually do anything for the story line. I'm hoping this was a fluke, and the rest of the season gets better."
2,A good show down the tubes,"As soon as they brought that baby in, the show went down the tubes. Now it's no more than an angst-fest."
2,Great show..but don't buy from amazon if u stream,Great show but amazon will not allow this content to be streamed to appletv. When I purchased the episode I though it would be a simple deal to watch the episode I just paid for on my tv. Not what I thought I was paying for
2,First 2 episodes of Walking Dead Season 3,"Irredeemably gory, to the point now where I question why I could possibly watch a TV show that might feed unstable viewers' blood lust. More gaps in plausibility than before. A certain young male character continues to grate, but then his parents are no better. Not sure the series will sustain my interest for a whole season. But not giving up quite yet..."
4,not as good as seasons 1 and 2,"It has had a few weird twists so it will be interesting to see how this season ends. I would have taken the story down a different road. Interesting plots and some mind bending killings I wish had not happened but it is a thriller, horror, and suspense film."
5,Favorite show!,"Great show, great acting, great writing, etc. Can't get enough. Just wish it wasn't so long between seasons. Love that I can get it from Amazon so quickly."
4,Awesome as usuall!,"So far season 3 has been pretty good. I like how they switch back and forth to the gang at the prison and Angie and Newbury. The fall finale will leave you on pins and needles, ugh February is so far away. Almost every episode is jam packed with life and death decisions and of course Walkers. I only gave it 4 stars because some episodes are a bit too heavy on the gore and not detailed enough in character development. Sometimes it's like okay we get the point Zombies are gross and gooey and bloody. I just think some of it is overkill. I would like yo have seen more develop with carol and Darrel."
4,"More action, less introspection in season 3","I like that everybody who is still alive has become very competent fighters. Also, Grimes seems to be willing to kill bad guys more now, which is reasonable, though he still retains his humanity, which means we can still root for him."
4,Sony PlayStation 3 and Amazon Instant Video plug-in,"I only have a 2mbit/sec Internet connection but most of the time, to my surprise, that bandwidth is adequate to watch a non-HD episodes of Walking Dead. My wife and I were hooked on the series in Season 1... We couldn't wait for Season 3 to show up on Netflix so we purchase on-demand episodes from Amazon. If Netflix doesn't start providing on-demand instant video just released content, like Amazon, we're going to make the switch from the Netflix subscription service to Amazon's Prime. Amazon, your ""Kindle for PC"" product sucks but your Amazon Instant Video, as it runs on my PlayStation is pretty darn impressive.Re: Walking Dead Season 3: we're not as crazy about this season as the other ones. We're losing hope in the fate of the characters. Although, we're glad Shane is dead, I mean, really dead. He drove us nuts from the start."
5,One of the best shows on tv,It really doesn't get any better than this. Still waiting for them to turn it into a movie. Can't wait till season 3 part 2 comes back on in February.
5,Love this show!,This show keeps you guessing. It is so intense and makes you very impatient to see what will happen each episode.
5,Walking Dead,This show keeps you on yours toes and under the blanket! It's not just about zombies but survival of a cast you grow to love. Definitely a thrill ride!
4,Andrea,She always has bad judgement when it comes to men. She couldn't see that Shane was bad for the group and now she doesn't she what governor is all about. What makes it worse is she is so stuck in her ways and beliefs. Still good episode.
4,Thank you Amazon Instant Video!,"Since I was not really monitoring what or when Dish stopped carrying AMC, I was shocked when trying to set the auto-tune to go to The Walking Dead! But when researching on myDish.com learned I could find my favorite show here.Thanks for continuing to expand and carry so many series, shows and movies. I am a fan of watching on catching up by watching on computer. And I am a great fan of Amazon."
5,Awesome show!,"I live out in the sticks and don't have cable and never bothered with satellite as I don't watch alot of T.V. I only have internet and I happened across The Walking Dead seasons 1&2 on netflix. Since then I am addicted and have been ordering the new ones from Amazon. I don't usually get hooked on shows, especially zombie/vampire/monster stuff, but this one is awesome."
5,Best season yet,"Lots of action, gore and plot twists...best season yet! Every week it gets harder to wait for the next episode."
5,great show,"The drama and suspense in each episode keep you on the edge of your seat, before you know it the episode, and your wait till next one comes out."
5,Hooked on Zombies,Watched the first two seasons recently and wanted to get caught up for the premier in February. Fast-paced mindless entertainment - love it!
5,Great show,My husband and I really like this show. The picture is also really good when we were streaming it online through amazon.
5,Awesome story. Gross Gross Gross!,"I love the story and the characters, I really, really hate all the gore. Seriously, no need to show so much of the violence and blood. I get that zombies are eating a person, I really don't need to see it in gory detail."
5,Walking Dead Season 3....I need more!,Love it! Can't wait for the rest of Season 3. The show is too addicting. I need me more Walking Dead!!!
5,Keeps you watching,I haven't jumped out of my seat so much in a long time. Like the characters. Keeps me on the edge wondering whats going to happen next.
5,Hooked,"This is seriously great television. No show on right now beats it. So convenient via Amazon Prime, too. Highly recommended."
5,Walking Dead Addict,"Was told about WD, watched 1st show and spent the entire weekend watching 1,2, and 3 to catch up before Sunday night!! Best show on TV!!!"
5,Walking Dead,I love this show....i saw the first 2 seasons of episodes on Netflix and now I order each episode of Season 3 on Amazon...its sooooo good!
3,A little disappointed,Just watched the the mid season opener and was disappointed. It just seemed empty. To many sub-plots and an anticlimactic ending. I just hope the next comes back on par with the previous episodes or I get to find something else to watch. Was just up to the hype given the last two months.
4,They call it a comeback,"After a fairly disappointing second season, I was pleasantly surprised with Season 3. Although I wish the Governor would take a long walk off a short pier, I am loving all the new characters and their development. I don't want to say too much so I spoil the show, but if Season 2 left you lacking after an awesome Season 1, come back to Season 3. You must see what happens to Rick. :)"
3,"Good, but not great","Addictive show that makes me want to continue watching, but character development and motivation seems painfully thin at times, and a lot of opportunities to make the show great (e.g., how to rebuild life and society after/during an apocalypse) are left on the table in favor of gore and cheap thrills."
5,Love ot,"Love that i can pause it, play it from any computer any where. When i log back in its where i left it so i can resume"
5,I love it!,AWESOME SEASONS! We look forward to every episode.It's one of the best shows I' ve ever watched. Great special effects specially in the zombies.....
5,Favorite Show On TV,"I love the genre of zombie invasions, and this is the best of it's kind.I've grown to care about the characters, which is a plus to me."
5,"REAL LFE,MAYBE","I JUST SIMPLY LOVE THE SHOW,I NEVER MISS IT AND RECORD EVERY SHOW TO WATCH OVER AND OVER,I LOVE DARYLE!!!"
3,The Boring Dead,"Somehow you've got to make the zombies scary again or else change the name of the series to the ""Boring Dead""."
5,Hooked,Randomly caught the 2 hour premier and managed to get caught up on 3 1/2 seasons worth. New episodes can't come quick enough. Absolutely love this show!
5,Cliff hanger every episode,One of the best shows on television right now. Almost makes me consider getting cable again but prefer watching commercial free.
4,"Great show, Expensive per-episode price","If you have not seen the walking dead, you are missing out. The show is great, it focuses on the humanity (or lack there of in most cases) and of course, gut wrenching zombie gore. This show is an instant classic, hopefully it plays for several more seasons.Can't justify paying a $2.99/per episode price though, what the heck... if it were $0.75, yeah maybe."
4,Not as good as Season 2,"I really enjoyed Season 2. Season 3, maybe the setting of the jail, the fatigue of zombies makes it a little less interesting.now I've watched through the latest episode and it did get more interesting so 4 stars now."
5,Best show on TV!!!!!!!!!!!!,Love it! Love it! Love it! I never thought that a show could be so realistic and scare the crap out of me! Great acting. Great story. Pretty true to the comic. The best show on TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,READ THE COMIC,"Or better yet, DON'T read the comic. You'll probably like this more than I do.What have they done to Andrea and Michone?My God. Andrea is the furthest thing from a good character. Whiny, whiny, whiny. And Michone? WHAY WON'T YOU TAAAAALK? Jesus, that's annoying.Rest of the cast is great. Can't wait for a zombie to munch on Andrea and Michone to cut off her head!!!"
5,The best show on television,"See above. The best show on television. Period. Action, suspense, lots of twists and turns. I Cannot wait until February!!!!!"
3,Good plot; too gory,"The plot draws you in and the well played characters keep you on the edge of your seat. But the bloody gore, descriptive killing, and sex scenes are just too much for prime time television. The same suspense can be achieved without such explicit detail."
4,Good,"Poor special effects. Suspenseful but sometimes characters act unreal. Otherwise, a good show.And here are the other seven words."
5,greatest zombie show ever,"Can't wait for the next episode! Every show keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation. Thrilling, exciting, just plain great!"
5,Great Show,This is one of the best shows on T.V. right now. I will definitely continue to watch as long as The Walking Dead is on the air.
4,Behind the Scenes look into a great show.,Fairly entertaining look behind the scenes of the Walking Dead. Its cool to see some candid interviews with some of the cast memebers. Who knew the actor who plays Rick has an english accent. If your a fan of the show you will enjoy this look behind the scenes.
4,More great writing and action,"This episode sets up another great season: more great character moments and, of course, action.The quality was good, though I wish Amazon would make the show available as soon as it is purchased (or at the same time it is aired). The show airs on Sunday, and I can't watch it until later on Monday, which is frustrating."
5,Best Zombies Ever,"What can you say, great acting and Zombies, doesn't get better than this. One of the best shows on TV."
5,Awesome,Love this show!! It's just soaks you in the moment and has you sitting on the edge of your seat!!!
5,I love Zombies...,This is not the fake type zombie... Great show.Love itLove itLove itLove itLove it L
4,"Watch it, if you like tense, gripping dramas.","Way better than season 2. I'm looking forward to the second half of this season, starting this weekend! It's really about the people, not the zombies."
4,Excellent,"Very good quality, and season 3 of the walking dead has kept me on the edge of my and amazon lets me watch the shows even if I miss them on tv."
4,Different kind of Zombie Series,"Has a decent plot and no single character is immune to getting Zobiefied. Does a good job on characterizations and how the stress of these long term disruptions in 'normal life' can work on everyones mind. A managable number of subplots and twists keep it absorbing. The constant 'kill off, run off, bug out' of characters allows for introduction of new blood(bad choice of words) and characters into the plot. Overall a really entertaining series."
4,Brain Dead Souls,Great episode. I'm completely hooked on Walking Dead. This show has got me dreaming about zombies. I can't wait to see the next episode.
4,Walking Dead Season3,i like the story but the acting is not the best. l am looking forward to the last half of season 3.
5,Just when you think it's gotten good,"Most show seasons have peaks and troughs. This season so far has just been a steady increase in action, drama and twists. I don't want to know how much farther to the top!"
1,AMZON SUCKS AT STREAMING!!,"This review is for Amazon's ""Streaming"" not the show itself...because unfortunately I was unable to watch it since amazon doesn't know how to have reliable streaming. It literally just errors out before I can watch any of it. This kind of sloppy tech just isn't going to cut it nowadays. On a side note, they had zero problem charging me for the show, at least they have that right. Don't waste your time and money, go somewhere else more reliable!!"
1,Walk With Me,"I am very disappointed with this season. It is not very exciting to watch. It started slow in the first episode and 2nd. I was hoping the 3rd would flare up a bit. Unfortunately, it did not. This use to be my favorite show. I will continue to purchase, but hope it gets more exciting soon."
1,Where's the episode?,"I bought the episode pass, so where's the first episode? All I'm seeing is the ""Inside the Walking Dead"". Am I missing something or does this really not make sense? I would think there would be something that says the next available episode will be ready to watch at this time. Nothing though."
1,I'm PISSED,"Amazon just took 45 mins out of my life for nothing Some stupid error in regaurds to my one-click account. Tried to resolve to no avail.... 45 mins later and I still have not seen my show. Talk about a waste. Can't even call for help cause tech companies don't hire enough real people, it is just easier to add another button to push to send you to some FAQ page in hopes you'll figure it out and pay them more. This tech stuff is going south.STILL PISSED. STUPID AMAZON..."
4,Getting Better!,"At the behest of a commenter below, I've decided to update my review and focus more on the actual events of the show. After watching Season 2, I was skeptical about the direction that the show would take in its 3rd season. For lack of a better way to put it, the majority of Season 2 was, um, well... a little slow. Thus far, Season 3 has given us a return to the action that I found so engaging in the 1st season. I'm certainly looking forward to continued developments within the prison. I'll leave it at that, as I'd rather not provide any spoilers for anyone who hasn't yet watched the episode. If you haven't seen it, watch it!"
1,Dish Stinks,Waiting 24 hours for the season premiere stinks...How disappointing!!!!!!!!!! I agree with all the other fans who have been sent here by Dish... Now I just hope the straming works well in HD without glitches...I may cancel Dish soon as well....and what about next season???????
5,Still kickin' butt!,The seiries is still kicking butt after three seasons. I have always been a huge fan of the Zombie genre and this series has consistently gone way above expectations. LOVE IT!
4,Zombie Entertainment,"I'm normally not into shows like this. However this was well written and directed, with convincing actors. It keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat"
1,Video does not load,can only watch the first 24 second of this video?? I paused it for an hour to let it load but still can't get pass the 24 second mark. I should have just looked for a free video on the internet. no more buying from amazon.
1,"Love the Walking Dead, Hate the fact that I cannot see the videos I purchased due to a glitch with amazon.","Actually love walking dead season three (and one and two). Don't particularly care for on demand video as the last two times I have tried to watch the videos I purchased, I was unable to do so. One time I can't get on, I can overlook. Two separate days that I cannot access the videos and I think that amazon is charging me for a service that they cannot deliver on and should give me a refund."
2,Half a episode,It's bad when I can describe what happened in this episode in barely three sentences. Could of missed this episode.
1,This is review of amazon video more than S3E1,I watched S3E1 today and the sound only came out the right speaker of my home theater system. It sounded horrible. I was disappointed.
5,Best!!!!!!!!,Best series ever made! Can't wait for new episodes to start. This show will be hard to beat! Awesome! Best!
5,Love the Walking Dead,"Absolutely love the Walking Dead series, watched season 1 and 2 on Netflix, bought the first 8 of season 3 for my Kindle, does anyone know when the rest of season three will be available to watch? Can hardly wait."
4,Amazing!,"Walking Dead continues with beautiful photography, complex plot lines and suspense! Renting episodes is a great option for those of us with no cable who miss our weekly showings at a friend's house! :)"
5,Best Season So Far,"Let's all be honest, the Walking Dead is amazing, but there were a few slow points in the first and second season.Not in this season though. It starts off with a bang, and while others episodes might not be as action-packed as the premier, all of them are interesting and have some great scenes.Also, almost all the characters have changed for the better. Carl and Lori for example redeem themselves for the way they acted in the first two seasons.This is a must-watch for any zombie lover."
5,awesome,so far so good. just on 8 th of the season. They better not kill off Daryll I will be hot if they do.
5,Great season for Walking Dead,This season has rocked with lots of action and great characters. Going to be hard to wait out this break for the rest of the season.
5,Best season yet!,"I won't say it's ""best ever"" or anything, there are still a few things that don't quite make sense but for this show I feel this is the best that they've done so far. The season isn't over, but it's keeping it's momentum week to week as of the halfway point."
5,I like zombie flicks,Don't look for anything more than a zombie soap opera and you'll be very happy. Here are five more words.
5,Surprised Myself,"Was surprised when I first watched this series that I was instantly taken with the plots and drama amoung the many interesting characters. Have found myself on the edge of my seat each week. Sometimes crying, sometimes cheering, sometimes holding my breath. A great series that delivers excitement and keeps one coming back for more. Not for young viewers by any stretch!!"
5,Even My Girlfriend Will Watch It,"If you love the zombie genre, you probably have already seen this or are watching it now. But what you may not realize, is that it is so good, even you girlfriend(or any non-zombie loving significant other) will watch it and like it! Well written with characters you want to cheer for."
5,Amazing!,This season will not disappoint! The action is great and the characters continue evolve. The is the best show on t.v!
5,Such a great show!,This season has been the most intense of all three seasons thus far. The acting is superb and the storyline can literally go a millon differnt directions. The creators of the show have done an outstanding job with this. Please keep it going!!
5,best show ever,Love this show! There hasn't been a show this good since the Sopranos. I can't wait for the next episode.
5,walking dead all episodes,Love this series cant wait for the next episode in February. I have watched all 3 seasons so far the episodes can't come fast enough!
4,Like It!,I just started watching The Walking Dead. I had to purchase the additional episodes that weren't On Demand. I enjoy this series.
5,Awesome show and the best season yet,This is the best season so far and it a great series. I have see all the seasons and this is so far my favorite but you need the context of past ones to really get some of the characters.
4,Keeps you interested and in suspense,"Keeps you interested and in suspense. If you are still watching the show in Season 3 you've gotten past the gore factor. The story line continues to evolve and despite a lot of blood and violence, it's about human behavior, relationships, morality and more."
5,BEST SHOW ON TV PERIOD!!!!,"All I can say is that, this is one of the best drama series in the history of TV! The others are of course BREAKING BAD, THE SHIELD AND THE WIRE!"
5,Amazing show,"By far one of the best originals from AMC. Mad men, Breaking Bad and this show puts AMC in a league of its own. All these shows have great acting in common and are not hesitant to push boundaries. The only downside is the irresistible urge to watch all episodes in one sitting :)"
5,love it!,"its a great show i cant stop watching it, i really wants to know whats coming next!I totally recommend it!"
5,"Awesome show, My favorite","I Have watched Walking Dead from the beginning. It is awesome with wonderful acting. I especially like Andrew Lincoln. His acting is believable in the story, he has sacrificed his life for the group. I don't like David Morrisey's character but it is good acting if you don't. I'm sorry to see Lori gone, that show was emotional for me. I hope that Rick survives with his humanity and love for his two children."
4,Much better than season 2 so far,"Halfway through, Season 3 is much better than Season 2... more action, less soap opera drama, the acting seems better"
4,Love the show,I do not have cable or satelite so this works perfect and its good quality and very easy. Wish i had all shows on here
5,This show is awesome!,This show is awesome. I wasnt really into Zombie shows but decided to give it a try after listening to friends comment on it. I got hooked after the first season and can't wait for season four.
5,Addictive,My wife loves it and I find it entertaining. If you are into Zombies this is very well done with great acting and plot.
5,A true fan,I am a true walking dead fan I don't miss any of the shows I like to retain coppies so I can watch later
5,Great show that leaves you wanting to watch every episode back to back,Definitely more than just a Zombie show. The other story lines are weaved together beautifully. Some scenes are bloody and hard to watch.
3,Underwhelmed,I was really looking forward to this current season but I'm disappointed with the storyline. It doesn't seem to be going anywhere and it is excessively violent this season. If I wanted to watch 40+ minutes of zombie slashing I'd play a video game. I hope this season improves quickly or I'm cutting my losses.
2,"Interesting Concept, Brain Dead Choices","I really wanted to love this show, honestly. It had a great plot and interesting development, but the gratuitous gore and forced depression when the characters die is the making of a gore-porn, watched to get those ""sick"" feelings in your stomach when watching it and craving for more because it's different. This goal of the writers is to bring people in that way and not so much a straight up good story by itself. So many characters die stupidly when all they literally needed to do was turn their head or pay attention. Re-watch the deaths and see what I mean, almost all are related to unnatural stupidity that normally would not be an issue in the real world, which this is trying to simulate. I guess you can make a case for ""Darwinism"", but as soon as enough characters die, more are introduced into the story to ""fill the gap"".So much more potential, too bad it got hung up on the shock factor routine."
2,"Walking Dead, Season 3","I'm very disappointed in Walking Dead, season 3. I have, at this point, given up on the series, and I will wait for it to come out on DVD at the end of the season. I can appreciate the need for splitting the attention between two groups. There are, after all, only so many different ways to present life after the Zombie Apocalypse, but I'm getting the impression of no forward movement to speak of, in spite of the different groups. I'm also finding no sympathic characters this time around, which makes it difficult to care about what happens to who.Hopefully the series will prove me totally wrong on all this, and it will work out. I have enjoyed the series the first two years."
2,I should have only watched the first season.,"After 6 episodes, I was hooked. Then Season 2 kinda lost me. Now I'm done. I should have known you can't drag out these end of civilization shows this long. It just seems like the writers are grasping for anything now. The tension and scare factor from season 1 is gone. Glen is the only character I even ""care"" about anymore."
2,My thoughts,"Well I love this show but when watching it on this site I get alot of my video saying for me to try again later. It does a lot of buffing so I should've stuck with the one that is not HD,it's cheaper and buffs just as much as the HD. I will not be purchasing the full seasons from u all. I'll stick with Netflix."
2,Boring,I have loved every single episode of the Walking Dead since the first episode until this one. Talk about boring! I really hope this is not where The Walking Dead is headed.
4,"No problem with the series, but not into the Amazon service so far.","How is it that I have supposedly ""purchased"" each episode so far, yet if I accidentally click on a previously-viewed episode I'm charged again, and supposedly ""purchase"" it again? I'm a big fan of Amazon in general, but this isn't going well. Customer support! If you give me a sausage, or explanation (look through the records) I'll support your bad-ass further. Otherwise ""meh"": you're toast. We're talking 5 bucks or so."
3,Seedy,"It was Ok, but did not update the main group at all. It should have focussed on the group, and some updates on those seperated."
5,killer,this season is grate killer you need to see this it is the best tv show out their you you will ever see . it is a must see.......
4,Just waiting for the rest,"So far so good, im waiting for the rest of the season to see if its a five star rating"
5,Its only getting better,"After the midseason finale of season 2, the show has been climaxing ever since. Now we hit season 3, where the governor comes in, and everyone who has read the comics knows that when the vroup meets the governor, it gets good. This season has to be the most jam packed and intense season yet, it blows all others into the sky. The only bad part, iz that since its going so fast, they're going to run out of comic material, so they're gonna have to be creative, like their past episode, #10. I recommend this series to everyone, as its not just blood and goar, but its how people react to the situation, and that's better than any blood and goar you'll see."
5,Easily the Best Series in years!,"To be quick, the writing was great to begin with and it is even better this season. Plenty of mysteries to keep you guessing.Just try it you will be glad you did."
4,Addicted to Walking Dead,"Missed this show when it was televised, I am now trying to catch up to get ready for the next season."
5,Walking Dead Rocks,"I love this show, and I love watching it with no commercials! I can't wait to see more of it."
5,Best Season Yet,The third season has continuously shocked me and kept me invested every episode. Much better than the second season! I recommend watching Walking Dead just so you can get to this season where they are pulling out all the punches.
5,LOVE IT!,"Wow! Can you even imagine a world where there is no government, electricity, or communications and you do pretty much anything and everything you can to survive? Granted the number of people isn't that many since most of them are walkers or actually dead and i only count people as the living ones. They are constantly in danger but they are strong and the group does a pretty good job looking out for one another. It is really cool to see all the different things they come up against and the interesting and creative ways that they get out of situations. If you like fantasy and sci-fi shows and movies this is definately the show for you."
5,Best ADULT series ever!,"From the make-up to costumes to superb acting ability, this raw creation will leave a lasting impression. At the end of each episode, my man & I realize that we've held our breath through 95% of it. Gripping, unique, thrilling, and oh-so-suspenseful. Thank you, thank you, thank you AMC for putting such a kick ass series out for the general populous, not just that geeky comic reading subculture who obsesses about the zombie apocalypse. No offense (unless of course you're 30 years old and still living in your mother's basement).If you haven't experienced The Walking Dead yet, you're missing out!"
3,Season 1 and 2 Wayyyyyy better,Season 1 and 2 where great and had some original content. Not sure what is happening to season 3. Zombie kills are cheezy and losing interest fast.
2,favorite show but...,"the walking dead is by far my absolute favorite show, so I have no complaints on the content, but I ordered episode 1 of season 3 (not in HD) and it froze up about 7 times. I had to restart a few times. I don't know if HD is different, but I would go with HD if you're going to watch a movie/series on Amazon instant.other than that, wonderful service, and was downloaded within 2 minutes"
3,worth the wait...I guess,I love the walking dead and I will continue to finish out this season but I'm hoping it is not as boring as the 1st episode of season 3:(
3,Declining,"They are really dragging this season out, frankly I'm getting sick of all the boring stuff, and the episodes that nothing happens at all that is relevant are just dumb. I don't plan on finishing the show."
3,I got to watch it,"I got to watch the show, that's a big plus.However; I was watching on my tablet and when I tried to view in full screen, the screen went black. The sound was still working, but It was almost as if it just couldn't buffer the video.. When I hit back to return to the normal size, it had some color issues that went away after 10 or so second. The problem from there was, every few minutes a message would appear, while playing the show that said 'Internet is not responding and needs to close' 'Wait' or 'Ok'. Clicking wait allowed me to continue watching, but the message would reappear a few minutes later and I lost the ability to pause or fast forward/rewind. Stopping the show, closing the internet session and starting over fixed the message problem. Full screen, on the other hand, never worked.Quality left a lot to be desired, but I did not spring for the HD version. Get what you pay for I s'pose."
4,Modern Dark Shadows?,"I watched the entire first season in two days, desperate to like it. As an avid zombie/post apocolypse eater, it seemed right up my ally. I HATED it and, proceeded to ignore it's existance untill a month ago. It's just so freakin' slow and the characters...I still hate most of them. A friend practically tied me down and about half way into the second season, I couldn't get enough. The concept of ""aquired taste"" has always confounded me some. Why continue to involve yourself in something that you do not enjoy? Maybe because some small part of you is aware that an epiphony is near? But, don't take my word for it, you won't anyhow. Wait untill that one incredible friend of yours says ""trust me, you're going to love this""."
3,Quality.,More scenes & longer episodes not to mention HD should be Standard. Netflix allows viewing the whole season as standard instead of $1.99 per episode.
4,Best Zombie TV Show Ever,"Zombie fans, this is the show you have been waiting for. The makeup, the effects, the nastiness, all first rate stuff! Never seen a better looking zombie ever. On the other hand, you will cringe at the stupid plot points and writing. This is a good show, just sad that it couldn't be better. The show is missing Frank Darabont but it's still fun.R.I.P. T-Dogg"
5,The incredible walking dead,A must see for any science fiction fan. leaves you w leaves you wanting more. I cannot wait for February 10th.
4,Like the Series,Good story line. Looking forward to part-2 of Season 3 in Feb. I finally understand why someone may want to own an AR-15.
4,Watching on line,is a good idea but I would prefer the DVD in my collection. This was an affordable alternative to DVDs and cheaper than DirectTV and cable. Thanks!
5,The Best,"So much fun and suspense, always on the edge of our seats. The only problem is the seasons are too short and the time between seasons is TOO long, almost to fault."
5,walking dead,It's a great show with high quality. I love this show and I would extend this to other people totally
4,Mid-season premier,"For a Premier I would expect more, but as this was mid-season, it is understandable not to out-do the finale or the next season premier......This episode started off big and then became very anti-climactic.... also, the reactions everyone had when Rick started hallucinating about Lori and flipping out were too mellow and out of character as compared to everything else this group has been to"
4,DAWN OF THE DEAD RELOADED,best zombie tv show ever!!..this show is like no other on TV watch it and love it YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED
3,eh...not as good as other seasons,"This season isn't as good as the others. For every awesome show, you're forced to sit through 3 really boring ones. Still love the show, but this season hasn't impressed me"
5,ZOMBIES,"I think the headline of this review says it all. As a member of the undead, I had been waiting for a show to come out displaying my daily interactions with the ""living"". Needless to say, this show accomplishes this, showing the hardships we must endure (stabbings in head, arrows to skull, clubbings, mutilation, etc.) as we search for food and try to get hugs from the ""living"". They rarely let us get close enough to show them just how much we care, but when they do, they typically come around after a hug and sometimes they even join us!"
5,Walking Dead is the Bomb,"The best TV show ever. Great acting, Great story, Great effects and Great Intensity. Move over True Blood this show is number 1 now."
5,Braaain's,After the first couple of shows I was hooked and have remained so. Every season more twists and turn's and characters are added.That keeps me always looking forward to the next show or season.
4,And I thought I was sick of zombies,I thought they had run zombie s*** into the ground.....I was wrong.Finally somebody baked the zombie cake just right...
5,"Walking Dead Season 3, episode 1: AWESOME!","There are more walkers out there, and it makes for much better television. Last season was slow IMO, but this season has started off with...well, I was going to say the typical ""bang"", but there's no dialogue in the first few minutes, just zombie killing and running like hell. The stay-alives come upon a prison, and, lots of zombie kills later, decide to stay there. Lori and Rick are barely talking, and she's worried that the baby will be born a zombie. If this first episode is any indication, season three is going to be AWESOME! If you haven't watched Seasons 1 and 2, do so!"
5,Love the walking dead !,Thank you Amazon for providing me with this show. Absolutely love this show! Love having the new episodes in a timely manner! I can now talk with my coworkers about the show with out them mentioning any spoilers.
4,Hooked,Can't wait for Sunday nights... Always look forward to new episodeds and it was great to catch up on the ones I missed.
4,Decent,"I don't know about other fans/viewers for the show. But last like 2-4 episodes seem like disappointing filler episodes almost. Least for season 1 and 2 if I recall, least each episode seem to have a purpose of some sort. I just home last like 2 episodes something crazy happens."
4,Such a great show!,"I love the show but sometimes the show takes awhile to load and its not the internet or computer. I watch Netflix all the time and loading time is never more than a few seconds but with amazon instant tv, it doesnt always load and when it does, it takes a while. Other then that, I love it!"
4,Interesting Twists...,"Although I don't know that all of the twists contained within season three are going to pan out, it has been a riveting season thus far and has definitely kept me coming back for more every week without fail. I do like how the story follows what I would think, psychologically, would happen in a post-zombie apocalyptic world in that people who deal with them regularly become almost desensitized to the zombies themselves, they simply become a hazard to avoid and the real dangers come from other survivors, who aren't mindless drones."
5,The best show ever,The walking dead has to be one of the greatest shows ever created off one the most action packed comic book ever invented.
4,Review,Last episode is a real cliff hanger. Can't wait to see what happens next...I really need to get out more.
3,"Ehh, it's ok, should have waited for Prime","Started off really good, but now mid-season it's pretty slow and boring. I wish I would have saved the money and waited for Netflix or Prime."
4,"Continuity err wrong eye, lol.","I've been follow this series for some time and I love it. Suspenseful, scary, and full of surprise in every episode. I enjoy every characters arc and how they all become a cohesive family unit. However, I've notice near the opening scene the Governor of Woolbury is pulling the dressing off his damaged left eye then towards the end of the episode where Andrea is in bed with Governor's now his patch is over his right eye instead of his left eye that is suppose to be damaged. I don't know if this intentional or a spoof for future out takes for a DVD gag reals. For crying out loud that's just too funny!"
5,2nd best episode of all time,2nd best episode of all time. Wish they would kill the kids though. Carl is a bad actor. Please kill him off soon!
4,very interesting.,Interesting! Shows Zombie puppets and the person who made them. The walking dead show is one of the greatest shows about Zobies ever!
5,Season 3 is great so far!,"I love the Walking Dead! This season is good so far! I like the characters and this season, The Governor, seems very interesting."
5,Great characters.,"I hate zombie stuff and anything scary. In fact, I usually scream at least once through each episode. However, the storyline is interesting enough that I'm willing to watch it still."
5,Awesome return,I love this show and I think it is awesome that I can get it on Amazon. One of the best shows I have ever seen.
5,Survival at its best,"If you like movies about how the normal citizen would handle survival in the apocalyptic afterworld of zombie ridden American wasteland then sit down, strap in and hang on...this one is a doozey! Although we don't seem to understand how everyone's clothing is being washed or just exactly how the survivors are maintaining protein levels high enough keep their Hollywood physiques in shape but we do get a look at the types of stresses normal everyday people go through when iPhones and Netflix is permanently gone...oh yes and also when millions of the undead are roaming the planet!It's a gore feet though so no kids allowed!"
4,"It doesn't make sense, but I like it!","First episode in season 3 kept me wanting more.Doesn't make sense taking the only DOCTOR on a patrol through the prison?Rick... ""I understand my wife is pregnant and she'll need a doctor, but lets take Hershel anyway. I know he's old and slows us down but I can't risk him just sitting around in a secure holding cell, a zombie might get him."""
5,Awesome!,My wife ( who hates zombie movies ) watched te first episode and got hooked! She showed me and in one weekend we watched both season 1 and 2! Now we had to get season 3 and I love that even if my dvr doesn't record my amazon will have it for me the next day!
5,Best show ever!!,The Walking Dead is the best show on TV! The writing is so well done and the acting is simply amazing!! It's like rideing a roller coaster! It has evolved from being a stroy about zombies to a story of how the human spirit can endure. What is possiable when you are faced with absolute extention? Anything!
5,Dead,Nothing more to say than 5 stars!!!! Only bad part is I have to wait for the next show in 2013.
1,:(,Unfortunately i havent gotten this item. I cant say I recommend this because I havent seen it... I already payed my credit card and its been too long...:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
1,I love the walking dead. I hated my Amazon experience with streaming video.,"Walking Dead rocks!! Amazon offers so many quality products at great prices. I have had nothing but positive experiences before and since. I will not buy TV seasons from Amazon until I know they have improved the experience greatly however. I never found out how much the entire season was going to cost me. I had lots of trouble streaming the episode I bought and could not download it. It would not stream at all at first. Then when it did stream the overlay to pause and stop would not go away. I could not see half the screen. As a result, I cancelled after one episode and went to the other guy.Amazon, you do great things but this was uncharacteristically bad."
1,FAIL on this special Inside of the ......no captioning.,No captioning on this special portion of TWD so i have no idea wtf anyone is talking about. Why can't they caption the special features as well as the movie? Is it that hard?
1,Why does it take so long to get the episodes up on here??,"Ill start by saying I love the series. It isnt the series that gets the one star, its Amajoke.Episode 8 aired on December 2nd. Today is the 20th. Where is episode 9??? Why does it take this long to get them posted up here? Im better off just DVR'ing them rather than paying Amajoke all this money then having to wait nearly THREE WEEKS to pick up and episode.....This is the last current season Ill ever buy-----just isnt worth it!!!!"
1,NOT IN HIGH-DEF,"I've purchased/rented many [HD] movies/shows on Amazon, and this CLEARLY is not being streamed in High Def. I streamed it using three different computers and three different high-definition TV's and it is displaying in Standard Def. To make sure it wasn't possibly something going wrong with Amazon's streaming service, I streamed HD episodes of Hell on Wheels, which looked crisp, clear, and stunning.Do NOT get cheated; this is NOT HD.And, if anyone wants to know, I have a download speed that ranges from 18-25 MB per second."
5,This show is completely awesome.,"Need I say more? If you like it, watch it. If you don't, go see what the kardashians are up too..."
5,Awesome!,Loved this season!! This show just keeps getting better!! Seriously....I've gotten so 'into it' that I've caught myself yelling 'go back go back' at the tv like they could hear me lol XD
4,No subtitles,Love this show but subtitles need to be added. Otherwise the hard of hearing will have to watch it somewhere else.
5,Great show,"I do find this show difficult to watch due to the content, however I also find it well written and must see TV!"
5,What do you get a Zombie that only wants to eat you?,"It is season 3 and time to move from the farm into a prison. Once you have all the Zombies locked out, you've got nothing left to worry about, right? ... Right? ... Oh come on now. People need to all be on the same team. Can't we just get along? Evidently not."
2,Please kill the new characters quickly,"They are boring and lack personality.All but the black girl with the sword, you can live her. But kill the governor with all the people in the ""new city"""
5,Best show on TV!,I am currently in preparation for the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse and this show is the best resource I have found.
5,Great Season!,I love this show! I'll have to admit the first season is the best but the 2nd and 3rd season are right behind it. I always recommend this to people. Trust me you'll get hooked!
5,Zombie Central,"This is a well written escape from reality that always keeps you guessing about who's going to bite the dust next. The acting is pretty good, and the zombies look real. The storyline is exciting and often surprising. Watching the Walking Dead is a good way to spend a Sunday evening."
4,better than i expected,This is worth watching.I enjoyed the writing for this show. It is not as predictable as one may think.
5,BRAINS!!!!!!,Simply love this show. A little disappointed that they didn't follow the comics a little more close to story but a great rendition.
5,Great characters and story!,Just can't wait for the next episode and when Dish network took AMC of this was my only real choice!
5,Great stuff!,"I don't even like zombies, but TWD is one of the best shows on tv. With the introduction of the Governor, Rick and the gang have an adversary just as intresting as they are. Keep it comming!"
5,get past the gore,great show once i got over the grossness factor. Unpredictable and keeps you guessing. who will get be the one to go next?
5,Love it,This is one of the best shows on tv. Great acting and engaging story line.If you like character development this is the show for you.
5,Walking Dead season 3 - Seed,Great episode! A little more gore this season! The story continues though. They are in the prison and meet some interesting characters!
5,Excellent!!,"The only thing wrong is that you have to wait for the next episode, lol. Hopefully they continue this for several more seasons"
4,A classic survival tale,"Great acting, and an ever-changing plot make TWD a real drama and thriller. Beyond just a horror movie, it shows how people might react under frightening conditions they have little control over. The struggles they face, the heroes, cowards, and evil doers all play their part in keeping the story fresh, with new surprises always around the corner."
5,Walking Dead!,This was very easy to purchase at a very reasonable price. Story line is very entertaining. It leaves you waiting for the next installment.
5,A must see!,"All my friends kept posting Walking Dead on facebook and after a while, I said ok I'll bite ""no pun intended"" and then I got hooked."
5,Totally addicted,"Once you get past the grotesque and ravenous hunger of the zombies, this show is full of great character and plot development. The producers/directors have no qualms about killing off main characters, so there is a lot of risk and suspense in each episode. I ""devoured"" seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix in just a few days and now wait impatiently each week for a new episode in season 3. I would rank this series as just as entertaining as some of my other favorite shows: Breaking Bad, Mad Men and Sons of Anarchy."
4,Good show,More to it than just killing zombies. My wife does not care too much for it but she doesn't like violence
5,A+++,This is a great show better then most zombie films. I would be happy to watch this over and over daily.
5,the walking dead season 3,"I only watch this series so that i can see sexy Norman Reedus, that is one hot hillbilly. The plot is pretty good too"
4,season 3 not 5 stars,"my fav tv show, thought season 1 and 2 were better, many of the prison scenes were graphically dark, all of the gore and killing is fun but lets do it where we can see some scenery!"
5,Walking Dead,Love this show keeps me on the edge of my seat. I recommend this show to every one and the acting is awesome
4,walking dead..,"Zombies, undead or just people with really bad skin conditions...who cares? the show is about the survivors and how they manage to get along in the post apocalyptic world. So many layers to the story. I don't have cable, but yet, i manage to fork 1.99 per episode for this show. Why? it's a good show!"
5,Ground breaking,Ground breaking show that always leaves me wanting more. The unpredictable manner of the show keeps waiting to see what shoe drops each week
4,Slow at times,It is good but to slow sometimes. There us one episode of intese action and then one or two of drama.
4,It's worth a the time,"I've enjoyed the previous two seasons and the drama that is unfolding in a bit slow, but an evolution to what is to come so I 'suffer' through it. Overall I enjoy the trials and seeing the evolution from city slickers to hardcore zombie slayers and what each week will hold."
5,Dont miss out on this show!,"I love being able to not pay for cable television service anymore! I can use my expensive flatscreen and blueray player to watch only the shows I like. The walking dead is great, its a cool show for zombie lovers but its also got the drama ad storyline needed for everyone else. The zombies although scary looking do not pop out and scare you so I got my mom and dad addicted to this show! I wish we could purchase them on sunday night after they have been aired, but so far the earliest purchase date for this show seems to be the following day. So every monday we all get together little sister (14) my brother (24) and my mom and dad (mid 50's) all come over to my house to watch this show and hang out. I recommend this and breaking bad, both really great shows and fun to bring the family together, shocks my mom and dad but i know they love it and its great for young adults to."
5,The Walking Dead is the best Tv show !,"alright so The Walking Dead is the best show on TV for sure and the majority of folks will have to agree with me on that one. the thing I really like the most about this tv show is its all about the story and the character's which to me are very believeable, lisen if you havent watched season 1 you need to like now."
5,Gripping,"I'm not a zombie apocalypse kind of gal. Probably more of a Downton Abbey fan. But, this story lines in the this series are totally captivating. After the first few episodes, I got over the gore, and was completely sucked in by the characters. It's just too bad they keep dying...it feels like losing friends."
5,Great TV drama with a bit of shoot em up and zombies!,I thoroughly enjoyed this TV series! This show should have been nominated for an Emmy. Definitely pulls you in. I'm looking forward to future seasons.
3,Good to see other survivors,"So we've seen there are other groups out there surviving, all of them doing it more in Shane's style than Rick's. I think this gives us a taste of what Season 3 under Shane would have been like, only Shane could never keep his cool like the Govenor."
5,AWESOME,"I would not classify myself as a ""zombie lover"". I don't read books about zombies or watch a lot of horror movies but I love Walking Dead. They're is depth to the characters, the senerio is somewhat realistic, and of course, the show is suspenseful. WATCH IT!"
1,Disappointing Amazon,"Normally, I would be getting my Walking Dead from AMC directly...however circumstances beyond my control have left it to Amazon and they have failed miserably. If I buy a TV pass, then I should be able to watch it the night they premiere, not some 4 minute documentary on how they made the zombies. REALLY? This blows!!!"
1,the worst show so far,"Andrea and Michonne are not that interesting anyway ... and the governor and his group are unlikeable. If they have too many shows focused on this group, they're going to lose me ... and I was a serious fan!"
5,Walking dead,This is a real good series. We can't wait for each new episode to come out. We also love the high definition.
2,hmmm,I guess I have to be the one that says it but the first season was definitely the best so far.Don't get me wrong this season is still better than the second season(god that farm was getting old).But I wish there was that same level of emotional suspense as there was in the first season. I feel likenow the walking dead is a soap opera instead of a suspenseful drama.
2,Lame,"I had to cancel my season pass after episode 9 and 10, those were possibly the worst fight scenes I have ever seen. I don't think they consulted anyone on those scenes, as they were wholly unbelievable and totally lame. I'll wait for the show to hit Netflix or something because that was just sad."
2,Acting is awful,"I dont understand. I try so hard to love this series and I can;t even stand to watch a whole epsiode in one sitting. Seen about 15 episodes and still sick of the horrible acting and horrible story line. Stupid things happen every episode, such as his son being shot by a random hunter, huh?. How ridiculous. The show moves nowhere. AWFUL!!! The sound track is terrible, things are quiet, other things are loud, sound mixer needs to be fired, actors need to be fired.. I love the intro though!! Its the only good part!!!"
2,Season 3,Season 2 was about the worst show I've ever seen. Season 3 is better but its still awful. Amateur hour on amc.
1,loved the actual show... amazon gave us trouble though,the show is amazing an have nothing bad to say about it. amazon however ....when we bought the show it wouldn't play for 20 min. it kept saying we were playing things from amazon on too many devices but we didn't have any other computers up an running at the time. huge let down on amazons part. you pay a lot for a HD episode and then it won't play...not cool.
3,Okay .. .,"This is a Zombie TV series right? It's called the Walking Dead so I guess so.So when the series departs from a theme that has Zombies as the primary focus I get very uncomfortable.This episode has 'bout 30 seconds of Zombies as a ""part"" of the plot. Most of it is related to a really crazy guy who controls a town . . . a really sick SOB.A couple survivors who were separate from the main group are caught up with this settlement.I'm okay with this for right now but I have this creepy feeling that the rest of the season is going to get caught up in conflict between this small town and the group just like it did in the horrible second season on the farm.I'm not going to buy the season ticket as I'm waiting to see if this season tanks like last season did."
5,Best season yet,"We have been captivated by this season -- eagerly awaiting each new episode, with many suspense-filled moments each week! Best season of the three so far!"
5,Best season yet,"Probably the best season so far. Right from the start, every episode is gripping and downright brutal. Absolutely fantastic. Cant wait for the second half of the season next year."
5,I can't get enough!!,I love this show. i can't wait to see what happens next. This is one show that my husband both enjoy watching togather.
3,Fun but not great,"I think the acting is pretty bad, and the dialogue leaves something to be desired. But the visuals are good, and the design of the plot is pretty interesting -- I'm sure you can thank its graphic novel heritage for that. I devoured every episode within the span of a week. Each episode leaves you hanging, so you have to keep watching to find out what happens. It's fun, but it's not great."
5,Walking dead,"This show is awesome. I like how you never know who will get killed off. The show is always action packed and exciting.The down side is each episode is too short. A good cast, works well together."
4,Satisfying despite its plot holes,"Look, you know what you're in for if you're already watching Season 3. There are some good shockers and plot twists. There are still the same problems with the thin characterization of women and apparently the writers think that you can't have more than one viable black character at a time. However, watching everyone deal with their internal issues is really compelling and the main characters do grow in ways that make them more believable. I have to say that the best characters are the redneck brothers - Merle and Dale...I mean, who knew that rednecks would be the ones with all the necessary survival skills to make it in the zombie apocalypse??"
5,How could anyone not give this a five,"This is hands-down the best show on TV. I am typically not into series, but I watched the first season on Netflix and was immediately addicted. I could rave all day about the show, but just take some time and watch the first season and you will have the same addiction. Guaranteed!"
5,Best zombie series ever!,I'm hooked! The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever. I can barely wait every Sunday to watch it!!
5,Amazing,"Definitely the best season so far in the series. Some drama, character development and of course, lots of Zombies! LOVE IT!!!!"
5,Can't get enought,Just a great show. Just a great story on human perserverance and confrontation plus Zombies. Five stars for this great show
4,Needs more gore and action,We love the fact that they kill off a character that was pretty annoying to sheriff. And now it should be even more action because a new comer has been added to the group.
5,The Saga Continues,"The writers of this series are not resting on their laurels for the third season of The Walking Dead, and neither are the actors. The survivors are continuously in danger of being bitten and none of them are safe from being killed.This is the most intense season of the series so far."
3,"Sometimes, I'm not sure if I hate this show or like it.","I definitely don't love this show. I'm hooked though. The show is progressing so slow. I just wish they would ratchet up the action and/or drama. This season has taken quite a while to get rolling. Lately, I've found it difficult to stay awake. But dammit, I'm still compelled to watch."
3,This season so far...,"This season I hope is better than last. Thus far, I'm not as thrilled as I was with Seasons 1 & 2."
2,Not good this time,"Hi everyone, this episode wasn't good and I didn't like the last one either, so hopefully they will better episode next week."
5,Worth every penny!,This show make you forget it's a show. Story line is amazing. Acting is great! Me and my husband watched all of them
4,Post-Apocalyptic Ideas to Get Existential to,I watch this show and begin to deeply consider if my existence is worth the effort. It helps for me to remember to not take life for granted. Then I go about providing value to others. Yep.
3,Interesting back-stage zombie look,"Short, but interesting preview of upcoming new season... Some special effects inside view of how all those zombies are built and used in show.. Lot more blood promised for season-3 if you can believe it!"
5,LOVE IT,"Finally something different. I don't watch much TV, but after buying season 1 at Christmas, I'm hooked. Bought season 2 and downloaded season 3. I'm caught up and can't wait till Feb 10."
5,Never though I would like gory...,"I am not usually a horror show watching gal, but this series is so unpredictable, gripping and well written that I am completely hooked!"
5,LOVE!,"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Give me more more more! Best show on television, if you haven't seen it you don't know what you are missing."
5,best season yet,"it's like a really well-written, acted, shot, zed movie that keeps getting better as the story progresses. love it. lots"
4,"Love the show, hate Amazon's glitched delivery","Read the review title, says pretty much everything. They seem to be getting worse vs better in figuring out this content delivery process. A few more issues like this week, I'm rethinking prime."
5,Good,This is a great purchase from amazon. I had to have it and it was well worth the price.I love it
5,I'm hooked,"This is one of those great series that I can't wait to see the next episode of. Not everybody likes zombie apocalyptic tales, but in my opinion this series is great entertainment."
5,A Really Great Show.,"This show has taken a popular subject to the next level. Very entertaining, good character development and a great story line that keeps changing and keeps you guessing, so that it does not become predictable."
4,"After a disappointing Season 2, Season 3 brings back what we love about this show.","Like many other fans of this show, I was disappointed by the slow moving Season 2 filled with more drama than survival. Season 3 has been action packed with interesting characters and more of the dichotomy of which can be worse, the humans or the walking dead? I am looking forward to the future episodes of this show."
5,I love this show!!,This is THE best show out right now and it is good to be able to watch it at my own pace.
2,Time To Right This Ship,"For the first time in a long time, saw and episode that I regretted paying for. And that is a bad thing. I gonna stick with this series for a while, but it's just not as layered and complex as it used to be.The brilliance of this show is its ability to address ""virtue"" on a very physical level. I think they have of lost their way in this manner."
4,The walking dead is the walking awesome!!!!,The gore and the drama and thrills are awesome captured on film. You never know whichcharacter may or may not make it through any given episode which keeps you on the edge of your seat.Fall in love with a favorite character and your setting yourself up for a hard fall when they go down with just one bite!Great series!!!!
5,Great show!,"This is an awesome show, and although a little gruesome at times, the story lines are engaging and entertaining!! I would recommend it to anyone who can watch an R-rated show."
5,Why is this show soo great???,Wow this show is amazing. Im a 38 year old man and im literally crying over the ending part to Episode 4 season 3. Words cant explain how great this show has been week after week after week. Its addicting and thank you amazon for giving us the option to buy the episode a day after it airs for those of us who don't have cable. I just cant think of a way this show can get any better. Thats the gods honest truth.
2,It's become all about the drama,"By all means, watch the series. It's pretty amazing and addicting to watch, but the 2nd part of the 3rd season... well... changes. It becames more about the drama for the first 90% of the show and then, at the end of the episode, it feels like they purposely add a 5 minute cliff hanger. Not sure if I am going to contiunue buying the shows anymore. Maybe when it becomes free someday I'll watch it, but for now, not worth buying."
4,A little slow,Better than most of season 2 but still a little slow. Would like to see Rick snap out of it soon.
5,Awesome.......,Best episode in a while! Love this show. Why is it so addictive?? Can't watch enough. Need more episodes per season.
5,Enjoyed this season the most!,I think this was the best season of the 3 that are currently out. . . . . . .
5,Completely hooked,I am counting the days until the next season comes out. The Walking Dead is the most addicting show I've ever seen.
5,Addicted to this show,Was a great way to get caught up having missed the first few episodes. I thank my 12 year old for getting me hooked lol
5,Awesome!,"Great episode, cant wait for the second half of this season to begin again! Love the show so much thxs"
5,A great start,"After too long a break, my favorite show is back. Major characters are going insane, secondary characters are coming to the forefront, and new characters are introduced in more depth. My only problem with the series is that they are too short."
2,Why?,"What is the meaning of using a baroque violin if you don't take advantage of it's abillities? If mr. Biondi would have made this cd playing on a modern violin, then it would be a lot easier to accept and enjoy his playing. But to play the baroque violin like this... It think it is tasteless and boring from the beginning til the end. Allessandrini is though a brilliant harpsichordist. I still love the classic recording with Reinhard Goebel and Robert Hill. THAT...is taste, passion and genuine baroque-playing!"
5,Candlestick Thanks,"Fred did a great job describing our life that year. I can attest to the B-52 foul ups with TFA etc and know of the nav who inadvertently bailed out.I was eager to learn of the ""Bat"" training methods since ours were very informal.We did have a tactics book, but we were lucky to have very senior aircrew. Bottom line 4 missions and you go!Thanks again for the memories!Candlestick (Head Beagle)"
1,not worth the price,"this is a monitor that i bought from bestbuy as a combined deal. i have a compaq 17' monitor, and when compared to that this is bad. it causes a strain to your eyes, after a couple of hours. the resolution is bad at the edges. overall if you get it as a package deal fine, but ot worth buying it as a standalone on its own merits"
5,Saves your winter hide,"This is a staple product for my husband and me during the winter. The second ingredient is oil, so it really moisturizes. It doesn't have a strong scent, though I wouldn't say it's entirely fragrance free. It definitely has less fragrance than a typical Dove product. I don't really even consider it a wash -- it's more of an in-shower moisturizer. It doesn't lather, but it has a nice, creamy texture that makes it easy to rub on. It's also paraben-free, which is important to me. It makes the bottom of the shower temporarily more slippery, but it rinses away pretty quickly."
1,ITEM IS NOT CHROME,"Chrome is short for chromium plating, item is NOT chromium plated and is only silver colored.. LAME!"
4,Famously good,"I have gotten extremely skeptical of ""chick lit"". There is just so much ""garbage"" out there, written in the name of chick lit.However, this book is NOT one of them.Our main character meets up with a guy, they fall in love and get married. During all of this, the guy gets movie star famous. This story tells us of the struggles of living in that world - from the side of the non-celebrity (the wife).Although I found Jody to be a little annoying at times (speak up for yourself kiddo!), overall the story was told with intelligence and charm.We actually do get an ""inside"" peek at just how difficult it must be when you are the *insivisble* wife of a celebrity.This book is utterly charming and is definitely a notch above many of the chick lit books written today."
4,Different chicklit,"This book isn't like most other chicklit, there are no laugh out loud scenes or satirical looks at Hollywood life. It looks at how life in the spotlight isn't all it's cracked up to be, and can almost be too serious at times when the subject matter (a woman dropped into Hollywood and forced to deal) could have made fun of la-la land instead of painting it as such a distasteful place. Caldwell's writing is wonderful, and I really loved Kyra's relationship with Emmie, the woman who's taken care of her and become a mother figure. The variety of characters, from opportunistic female stars to the best friend back home, make this story enjoyable."
2,Formulaic and unbelievable characters,"I'm all for chick-lit. We read this for our book club, and we knew coming into it that it was chick-lit. But this is not recommendation worthy at all. From bland poorly created characters, unfinished relationships, and no time dedicated to creating a believable plot... the best I can say is that at least it fits the genre of chick-lit, or dust-catcher. I did have a great time laughing..."
3,"Enjoyable, but I felt my brain shutting down...","This was a fun mental junkfood book to read, but I really felt a little like my brain was slowly shutting down. I found it just a little too cliché, even for chick lit. And, I hate the phrase ""chick lit,"" but yeah, I can see this fitting into that category.The main character, Kyra, falls in love, gets married, then her husband gets famous. Being followed by rabid photographers is a real pain, and having her life examined under a microscope is a downer, especially the part where it helps her own faltering career and gives her the chance to work for the famous.I thought it was a little too preachy about the poor main character who never ASKED to be famous and now lives a difficult life because she is.It did have funny parts, though, and I did read the entire thing. So, three stars is my rating."
3,I think I would still like to try this for awhile!,"This story is about a fashion designer who can't get anyone in New York to look at her designs. She meets Declan thru a mutual friend and he is an actor and they fall in love. He asks Kyra to move to California.Right after her move- they struggled for a while and then a big break for both of them happens. She starts designing dresses for the ""well known"" and he lands a part that gets him nominated for an academy award. Their peaceful life starts to turn completely upside down and they become ""hunted"" people.One of their ""crazed"" fans starts to stalk Declan- and life becomes scary.The story is cute and I enjoyed it alot."
5,"Subtle, realistic, stylish and touching","As you do with a delicious dessert, I saved this book as the last to read from a large Amazon shipment, simply because I knew it was going to be the best. After reading ""A Clean Slate,"" I was mightily impressed, but ""The Year of Living Famously"" was even better: subtle, realistic, stylish and touching. I've added Ms. Caldwell to my list of writers-who-can-make-me-cry-on-public-transport, as well as to my list of automatic buys. She's an author I trust to tell a good, solid story with unexpected moments and not a cliché in sight. Bravo! When's the next release??"
2,Hoover SteamVac V2,"I have had as many as 6 bulldogs at one time and a hubby who won't remove or wipe dirty shoes. Clean carpets are a priority for me. There is no question that the Hoover SteamVac gets those carpets clean but Hoover charges a premium price and uses cheap, very breakable plastic parts on its product. I have had to return the under warranty machine and get another more times than I care to count. Number 1 problem? Little black rubber gaskets on a spring that control water and solution flow give out. Number 2 problem? Cheap plastic parts that break, even with the utmost care. Wake up Hoover -- you have a great technology -- now put it in a product that lasts!"
2,Buy the EXTENDED WARRANTY,"I never bought an extended warrant until I bought this. I read how it cleaned rugs well and broke often so I bought it.I like using it until it breaks, and it breaks every other time I use it. It is always the two water containers. I bought it at best buy and it has been back there 7 times in about three years.The handle will snap off or chip so that when you try to pick up the dirty water bucket, the top falls off. One time, the clean water container committed suicide! It just shot off the machine and broke.If the container breaks when you are just starting to clean, it may leak water.I hope that there will be no spills when it is off being repaired.It doesn't matter how gentle or careful you are, it will break anyway. Assume that when the warrant is over, your machine will be no good.By the way the hand tool sprays wide and so is difficult to control."
2,Cleaning: great! But....,"I was almost laughing reading these reviews. I thought it was just me who had problems! This machine cleans wonderfully! However, I had the same leaky strip of water when I used the attachments, I had the springs ""fall out"", I had the detergent leak everywhere, I had the clamps that hold the dirty water break off, and I had a cracked tank that was replaced for $45. I hope that answer's any questions.I really like the Hoover Brand and would buy another if I knew these details were fixed! All of these negative reviews don't lie."
2,"Poor quality parts, plastic parts break","The cleaning quality is far superior than the previous version. Thats where it gets two stars. On the 10th use, a little piece of the plastic handle broke, so now the capture tank lid is tough to seat. Then the other morning we come home and find our bathroom full of soap. The valve on the bottom of the soap tank failed and spilled the entire contents of soap on the floor. Good think it was on tile. Bad thing is thats were we keep our little dog during the day, I hope the soap didn't harm her.Only store your unit on concrete, or tile. It leaks even when working correctly (ie by design) keep off wood floors, carpet,etc."
5,Better than I imagined,"I have area rugs and wood floors. This product worked incredibly well. I didn't know if it was worth the investment since I did not have wall-to-wall carpets. I have expensive oriental area rugs and usually pay alot to have a specialized laundry clean them with just water. It is definately worth it. I now have a squeaky clean house and it feels great!It is powerful, easy to handle, and very efficient at removing the water and dirt and I was able to do it myself which is far more economical and convenient. I also used in on my kitchen linoleum to spruce it up and it worked great!! My carpets were dry in a couple of hours and it was not a summer day. Other friends at work are raving about theirs too. It made my pottery barn rug look better than new. Hope it makes your household happy too!!"
3,BUILT CHEAP,"THE CLEANING POWER IS GREAT I HAVE TWO DOGS THAT SHED ALOT, IT DOES GREAT GETTING OUT THE HAIR AND DIRT. MY PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO TREAT THE MACHINE LIKE GLASS. IT WAS USED ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES NEVER ABUSED AND THE CLEAN WATER RESEVOIR HAVE ALREADY BROKE. UNLESS YOU HAVE AWHILE TO LOOK FOR REPLACEMENTS YOU CAN'T FIND ONE"
1,Terrible - Buy a Bissell instead,My Hoover V2 never did clean my carpet well and then it broke after just a few uses. Even when it did work it was practically useless. I replaced it with a Bissell that sells for the same price and it is FAR better than the Hoover.
2,Quality Disappointment,"While I really like the results from this carpet cleaner, it is very cheaply made. The plastic water tank has a weak spot at the valve that just becomes brittle and renders the machine useless. I think it's time to try another manufacturer sinch the last Hoover I had wasn't up to par either."
2,Loses suction,"Our last (Bissel, I believe) steam vac was used monthly in the office and in our home, lasted 10 years.We bought the F77412 dual V steam vac in ~ 2010. We use it infrequently, but it has just lost suction a second time. It sucks up liquid into the front carriage area, which you can see, but not into the reservoir. When you turn it off, it dumps the liquid back down onto the rugs. I believe it is currently sucking up about 1/2 the liquid that it should. The first time, we took it apart and cleaned everything, and it worked for about 4 to 5 times. Now, it has lost suction again.We are very disappointed; We never had this happen with our first steam vac, which was a more basic model."
1,BIG Thumbs Down,"I give it a BIG thumbs down. I bought the cleaner when it was fairly new and paid $3oo for it. I thought since it was a Hoover, that I would be getting a long-lasting carpet cleaner. (especially at that price) The first thing to go was the clean water tank. I had to replace it at a cost of $65.00! Then I started having trouble with the shampoo bottle falling off the tank. The next thing was the shampoo leaking into the clean water. What next right? Well, as of yesterday (2/13/07) the little scrubbers will not spin/rotate at all. I thought I'd look at the reviews on this cleaner to see if it's just me, but glad I did because now I know it's not just me! And to think I was going to buy another one, hoping the newer model would be better. What a joke! I wouldn't suggest ANYONE purchase this cleaner! I'm considering a Bissel. We will see how that one rates! LOL"
4,L Clark,"This Hoover steam-vac appears to clean the carpets well. However as others have stated I too experienced some water leakage. My solution was to simply back off on the amount of water I used to fill the container. That seem to elimate the problem for me.The results upon completion seemed almost as good as what I got from the hired yellow truck people, and for the same price I get to keep and use this machine again.I would be remiss however if I did not mention that when the machine is filled with clean water, carpet solution and dirty water, it is heavy and a bit hard to move about."
2,hoover steamvac water tanks,I have bought three tanks for this machine. the last one i bought lasted one time use and the bottom of the tank shattered. im tired of buying tanks for this machine and i will probabably throw it out. this machine is poorly designed and hoover doesnt seem to want to do anything about these tanks. dont buy it if your smart.
3,"The Good, The Bad, and...","In response to both Arthem and Christine's reviews: I have had my steam vac for about 2 years. I have had the LEAKY water tank replaced by Hoover, free of charge, twice in that amount of time, through contacting them from their website (don't know why Arthem could not find a way to do this.) The replacement tank works well for about the first two whole-house cleaning escapades, then it starts all over again. When the machine is not leaking, it does a fabulous job on the carpets. I am wondering if the newer models have had this problem addressed. My brushes quit working yesterday (in the middle of a room - arrrggg), and I am not about to buy another Hoover model if the leaking problem has not been taken care of. I am hoping that the fact that the brushes are not turning is the result of a broken belt, which can be easily fixed by the consumer. I don't suppose Hoover publishes the manual online?..."
2,"Great short time steam cleaner, not for the long haul","I bought this steam cleaner one year ago and have used it roughly 4 times. Each time I used it, I found I had to turn the rotating brush switch from off to on a couple of times to get the brushes turning. I didn't take it to get serviced, because Hoover won't cover the service charge, just the parts and labor. It worked great until the day after my warranty expired, which is today. The brushes won't turn at all and it will cost you about 75.00 to get the turbine replaced. And as an added bonus, the clean water tank has started leaking. A common problem, according to the repair guy. Save your money and get the Bissell steamvac. The service guy said by far he has had the least repairs on it."
2,"Repair, repair, etc.",Had this and a previous for several years. You'd better be handy.....cleans well but numerous parts and breakage issues. There was good customer service and parts follow up but be prepared to maintain.
1,Brush does not work,"After about a year of infrequent use the brushes quit spinning. After careful cleaning and inspection it can't be fixed. This is an expensive lesson. Save your money, a cheap one won't break any sooner!"
2,Cheaply made,"This steam vac is okay. I like the spin scrub and it does a pretty good job on the carpet.The hand held attachments are other story. The spin scrub hand tool stopped spinning after the first time I used it. Not a big suprise because the one on my Hoover Vacuum did the same thing. The upolstry attatchmen cracked the first time I used it. I was using a lot of pressure, but that was the only way I could remove any water. When I finished I noticed there was no water in the dirty water tank. What little water I managed to suction could not even make its way to the tank. When I detatched the hose I found the water. It poured out of the hose and onto my carpet. I am sorry I spent the extra money buying a steam vac with attachments. They are a rip off. I guess I am just tired of spending a lot of money on things that are so cheaply made."
2,Parts are crap,"My Hoover SteamVac V2 cleans just fine - but the parts are so cheaply made that the machine leaked like a sieve after the first four uses, though I had treated it with utmost respect when filling, using and emptying. The clean water tank is made of a very thin, brittle plastic that cracked all on its own, right where the plug goes, so I can't seal the crack - and costs a minimum of $45 to replace, based on the ones I've found online. The carpet cleaner was way too expensive to justify this expense within the first year. I would not recommend this model to anyone else because of the shoddy construction."
2,Assembly Tank Sucks on this model,I had the older model (F5912-900) before I purchased this one. I had purchased it through Best Buy and I also bought the extended warranty on it and it's a good thing I did. This machine cleans really well the problem I kept having was with the assembly tank which holds the water and cleaning solution. It's really thin plastic and kept cracking. I never had that problem with the older model the tanks on it was really sturdy. It lasted me approximately 4 1/2 years and I only had to exchange it once during that time. I will never purchase this model again--I'm going back to the older version.
2,Broken only after one use...and still in the shop!,"After paying almost $300 for it, I expected a durable machine, but it wasn't. I used it only once to clean a few rooms. Nine months later, I tried to use it again and the brushes would not move at all. I took it to the local Hoover shop and the replacement part was on back order. I called the shop twice and they still have not received the part from Hoover. It's been over three weeks and it's still in the shop. This machine has too many moving parts that it's really easy for it to breakdown somewhere. I would not recommend this machine unless you want to spend a few hundred dollars for it to work only one time."
1,Broke after ONE use,"Worked great, and did a great job cleaning, up until it broke - which was ONE whole use. Now the brushes will not rotate. Although it is covered under warranty, I still have to drive 30 miles one way to get it serviced. What a pain. I see by the other user reviews that this is not an isolated incident either. Buyer beware - YOU ASKED FOR IT!!!"
2,Disappointed mom with 2 kids,"My husband just ordered this monstrosity to clean the tiled first floor and the carpets upstairs. Well, the bare floor attachment fell off three times in the first ten minutes - I think that my $5 broom and my $7 mop do a better job! As far as the carpets go - Cleaning the stairs was an daunting task! They are still wet and really don't look any cleaner! If you have a straight staircase it would be nearly impossible to clean the stairs without carrying the vacuum from top to bottom (it's too big to rest on a stair) - Fortunately, I have a landing half way up! Cleaning the upstairs was fine!If you have a high traffic staircase like mine - a better investment is the dirt devil spot scrubberfor $40. It's small, easy to carry, great suction,inexpensive, and does an awesome job on stairs. I've also used to clean the upolstery and carpets in my car."
3,You need to be handy with tools,"I've owned mine about 5 years now, and I will say that it does an excellent job removing pet stains from my carpets. But they are high maintenance machines. I've found that this can be minimized by emptying all the tanks (this includes the detergent tank) and letting them completely dry before putting them back on. Also thoroughly clean all parts such as the front clear plastic piece that sucks up the dirty water, brushes and filters. I've had to disassemble my twice now to fix brushes that wouldn't spin. Even following advice found in blogs, it took me a couple of hours the first time, but only 1/2 hour the second. I think a most of these Hoovers steam-vacs are based on the same flimsy design, and I'd look around a bit before I purchased another, but I don't think that there's much out there that will clean as well as these do."
1,Do Not Buy,"It is a shame that Hoover has not corrected the leaky tank problem, because the machine does a great job of cleaning. Since we purchased an extended warranty, the first machine was totally replaced. Guess what? the second has the same problem and I only used it twice!"
1,Another water tank victim,"As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, my water tank leaks like a sieve. the unit is completely unusable. When you see how poorly constructed the water tank is, you realize Hoover has built a clearly defective product. Save yourself trouble, buy another brand of cleaner. I will never buy a Hoover product again."
1,Clean water tank is empty before I can get it from the sink to the unit,"...which renders this unit worthless. This is my 4th Hoover (Including one I gave as a gift to my sister), after only one year owning this one it is useless. Where are the lawyers on this site? I think we need a class-action suit. It's ridiculous to spend this kind of money for faulty equipment."
1,Prone to breakdowns,"While the machine is effective at vacuuming, the machine has been a dud. I've used the machine four times and its already broken down two times. Once the spin brushes jammed and more recently, the top water tank seal broke. These problems seem common based on other reviews. I would avoid this product until Hoover fixes these issues."
2,won't use again,"I've used plenty of carpet cleaners in the past due to the fact that I have a dog and this by far is the worse one I've ever used. I would not recommend it if you have to clean any kind of spot up- i'm sure it does sort of cleaning but darn if I can tell- after several passes the spots are still there. Unless sommeone has another suggestion I'm going back to using the Bissell Pro Heat, it wasnt perfect but it didnt leak all over the place. Yuck now i've got to clean up the mess this SteamVac created."
5,excellent product,"I have three dogs so i use this every three months to clean the carpet..... and used it once a week when we got the new puppy.....it cleans the carpet like brand new, easy to clean and store..... this cleaner can easily stack up against the once you rent at the carpet stores...."
1,Works great for 3 months - then starts breaking,"Here's a big HINT. If they start offering loads of parts for an item, it means it is a lemon in more than one way. I loved it too in the beginning. Then about 3 months in, parts started breaking, the repair people blamed me for shoddy parts (ie the spinbrush is connected by one little green rod that breaks) I am now so disgusted with it that it sits in the garage, waiting to be loaded off to someone who wants to tinker with it or spend money on parts. (ie the only thing that I haven't replaced is the handle or the motor)It also decreases the amount of water it extracts as time goes on. So you end up with carpets staying more and more wet.I am outraged that I spent 280 for this for it to break so readily. Sorry Hoover, but I am going back to RELIABLE Bissell."
2,Chinsey piece of junk,"I got online this morning to find out about replacing the clean fill tank on this machine since it cracked and leaked water on my third time using it--past warranty. Luckily Google took me to this Amazon site and to the reviews that warn us about how chinsey this unit is made. Now I realize that although I could replace the tank, it will most likely crack again, and I will probably have to repair the brush assembly next, and that repair probably won't last. I speak as a person who usually has excellent luck with electronic products--they usually last for me many years past the warranty. We all know that things aren't made to last anymore, but Hoover made a big mistake making a $300 product that has parts that only last through one or two uses. This product really is a piece of junk with parts that are not worth replacing because the parts will still be made of that same chinsey plastic and won't last."
1,Worst Company,"Worked great the first 45 days. After that it just wouldnt suck up hardly any water, followed by complete failure of agitation brushes. Complete waste of money. Same with there vaccums."
2,Worked great - the handful of times it worked,"I've owned several Hoover vacuums, one is over 25 years old and still works perfectly and the other has outlasted even my pricier Kenmore vacuums, so I didn't think twice about purchasing a Hoover steam cleaner. And, as expected, this steam cleaner does a really superb job, when it works. The problem is, it doesn't work very long. The clean water tank cracked first, then the shampoo bottle started to leak, and now the whole machine is literally pouring out water - leaving behind a trail of saturated carpet. Hoover really blew it on this model!"
1,Should have learned.,"This is the second Hoover of this type that I have purchased. Threw away the first one as the cost of replacing leaking clean water tanks was just not worth it. Hoover will give you a free tank if you are within the 1 year warranty period but that ""Improved"" tank will not last either. You fill the clean water tank and watch it empty onto the floor from the back of the machine. Duh, buy a new Hoover, Yep I had always trusted the name. Not any more. The new model has the same problem with the leaking on the second use. If you really search their web site you can find a contact email address but you really have to look for it hard. Anyone giving 5 stars on this machine or it's predecessor are either VERY luck or work for Hoover. Expensive junk to get 2 uses out of before it is not useable simply because Hoover cannot solve the leaking tank problem. Really to bad since it did do a good job for 2 uses with 2 new clean water tanks."
3,Great Performance when new,"I have used this product for the past two (2) years and not unlike everyone been pleased with the quality of the cleaning. Yes the water container leaks when you take it off, yes the spring valves break very easily, however, you can purchase replacements from Hoover at a low price. All in all it has served it's purpose for two years, the most recent problem is that it does not suck up the water, so instead of having it repaired I am going to toss it and buy a new one. I figure if I can get 4 complete house carpet cleaings out of it that works out to 50 bucks a job, still cheaper than commerical. I really wish they, Hoover, would read these compaints, charge a few more bucks, and make it more sturdy."
1,The tank always breaks,"I, like many others, am very happy with this product when it is functioning properly - I love it. However, I've owned my steam vac for 3 years and am in need of my third clean water tank. When the first broke, I didn't think much of it. I just bought the replacement thinking this would never happen again. To my surprise, I need yet another clean water tank. I decided I would NOT buy the next one and that Hoover would send it to me. After contacting Hoover customer service at 330-499-9499 and escalating my phone call through two management levels, they are sending me my third clean water tank. Of course, I was told this was a one time deal, but I fully intend to contact them when the new tank breaks. They should either warn us when we buy that we'll periodically have to replace the tank, use stronger plastic, or replace the tanks for us!!"
1,Stay away!!!,"What a lemon. The first few times I used this machine I loved it. Then the tank started leaking. Then the springs fell out. Then the motor went 2 days after the warranty expired, but Hoover was kind enough to fix it for free. Then life was good for a few months. Then the leaking got so bad I finally called Hoover and they sent a free tank (I guess the problem is very common). Then the motor blew up AGAIN!!! The only good thing about this machine is its ability to suck the water out of your carpet... when it works. I went out and bought a Bissell Proheat 2x and am much happier with it."
2,Great when it works,I have had three of these machines. The only reason I have had three of them is I keep returning them and getting replacements due to manufacturing defects. The biggest defect is the brushes stop spinning. When it works its great and really cleans well. When this last one dies I will not buy another. Dependability is just not there.
4,Great little carpet cleaner ...,"We found this to be a great carpet cleaner. Leaves the carpet almost dry. Only draw back? The tank tends to be a bit small for the size of job we had to do. We found none of the problems listed in some of the reviews we had ... re:breakage. Like all equipment, one has to take care with the installation and removal of parts!Would recommend it for anyone living in an apartment or small home. If you have TONS of carpet needing cleaning, you may want a larger tank unit."
5,Hoover F7425-900 SteamVac,"I have used this twice and the amount of dirt that it removed from ""clean"" carpet was amazing! It is easy to use and leaves the carpet very dry if you do a couple of extra ""extract"" strokes. It is a little heavy to push but it should be manageable for most adults. No problems with leakage or anything else so far. It replaced our old Bissel ""Green Machine"" and it is a quantum leap above that system!"
3,Hoover Steam Vac,"I too have a leaky clean water tank. I thought it was something I did to damage it but in reading the online reviews I realized it was a defect in the cleaner. If it were not for that the machine cleans great, but I would expect to get more than a few cleanings out of it!!! I guess I will try and order another tank and hope for the best with the new one."
4,Love it!,"I spent a lot of time researching the best steam vac, after my old one, a much cheaper name brand, broke. This one turned out to be a great investment! I love being able to rinse the carpet when I am finished cleaning. The dual chambers for soap and water is a good feature, and the hand-held scrub brush is great at getting out tough stains. I have two small children and an inside dog, and I love this steamer!!"
2,Same story from 5 stars to 2,"Just have to echo what other folks are saying...Machine is AMAZING...until it starts to fall apart. First the handle on the clean water tank (used a bungee cord to get around that), then the brushes stopped turning. Took it in for service...and they still only turn about half the time.And no the unit was not abused, just used normally.Its too bad because this product is so close to awesome."
2,"Second Hoover, Same Problems","If you are interested in a well-built product, I highly do not recommend buying anything Hoover. This was the second steamvac I bought that had the Hoover name. I expected the manufacturing to be top of the line this time(my last one had part after part break). Unfortunately, the water tank does not hold very well, and having said that, can fall off and break the handle rendering this item completely useless. Once again, Hoover has proven to be a very bad manufacturer with even worse warranty service. It took one day for this item to break on my family, and it will take one day for us to return this and never go back to a Hoover product. I am now going to Bissel. I hope I have better luck with their line of steamvacs, and I recommend anyone interested in buying a good product to give Bissel a chance first. All the technology in the world doesn't make a difference if the product doesn't last."
3,cumbersome hose wont stay put,"Hoover is a great company that is why i am so disappointed in this latest model. I owned the widepath model from 2 years ago and unfortunately it stopped working, (it was a wonderful peice of machinary)so i had to replace it with this. This one,the hose wont stay put and the whole thing is a lot flimsier than the earlier models. It seems like hoover doesn t care about design anymore. The old model everything went together perfectly and the hose was never in the way, with this beast i m going to have to keep the hose somewhere else. The unit is functional and does what it is supposed to but the design is poor."
4,Hoover F7425-900 SteamVac Rocks!,"The Hoover SteamVac F7425-900 does a great job - comparable to that of a professional service. I had a Bissel model several years ago and this runs rings around it. I really like the separate water tank for dirty water. Much easier to use than I expected. It will pay for itself in two cleanings when compared to a professional service. It is a little pricy, but if you are going to spend $200 you might as well spend a little more and get a machine that you will be really delighted with.I have now had this machine for 2 years now of moderate to heavy use since we own several pets. I am giving this item 4 stars instead of 5 because I have had to replace a few parts - all of which are available on Ebay for at a reasonable price. The items that I replaced were the two tanks caps, the 6 brush floor part, and the cord hanger."
3,who knows,"If I ever figure out how to put it together I might like it. My sister has one and loves it. When she looked at mine, she couldn't even put it together. I have always liked hoover products, but the instructions are terrible."
1,10 Uses's and its garbage,"It appears 5 cents were invested into the water holding tanks discharge nossels because one has failed after only 10 use's. Also my brushes only work (sometimes) but usually not, after carefull maintenance,, which means water&solution is discharged in streams on your carpet. So like the lady above I went searching for parts to repair it myself and all the site offers is cleaner for 3x the store cost. And service centers!!! god forbid there would be one in NJ!!!!!!!!!!! Talk about a rip off product, And while im here i hate my two hoover vaccumes also, GOODBYE HOOVER FOREVER"
1,"Cheap plastic, find another product","I've used mine 3 times and the clear water tank cracked. Part #42272104 and this part is the ""better"" replacement part for some earlier models. $40 minimum for the replacement tank. Total disappointment!"
2,Cleans OK but does not last long,"Pros:Cleans carpet wellCons:NoisyFrequent trips to dump/replace waterWater tank broke after less than 10 usesHose attachments clip is only for storing the hoses in the closetLike others reviewing this cleaner, my clean water tank cracked along the bottom and leaked water everywhere after only a few uses. I only used hot tap water, so excessive temperature isn't the problem. The cracks formed at seam near the rubber valve and spread along the seam across the bottom.At first I assumed I had accidentally broken it, but after reading the reviews on this and other sites, I see than I am far from alone with this problem.At almost $50 for a replacement tank and a virtual guarantee that it will break shortly after use, I'll spend the money towards a better brand. After seeing so many other bad reviews on the quality of this, I don't see another Hoover/Maytag product in my future."
1,clearly defective,I have had my steamer for 1 1/2 and I have had the same problems as the rest of these reviews. The machine cleans very well but it is extremely leaky and clearly has a plug defect. I am on my 3 tank because the spring valve plug on the bottom of the tank that holds the detergent pops out and you can not put it back in!!
1,Cheaply Made,"I have had my cleaner less than a year, probably only used it 3 or 4 times. The plug/valve on the bottom of the tank that holds the detergent just popped off when I was refilling it. We tried unsuccessfully to attach it back on. I went to the website to see about ordering a new plug or even a new tank. The tank not only holds the soap but also the clean water. Neither part is on the website to order. I took it to a registered Hoover repair place in the area they said the plug can not be replaced or fixed. But I could order a new tank through them.If the cleaner had been used alot or was that old maybe I could see this happening but neither is the case. It is just cheaply made."
1,Brushes Stopped after 2nd Room,"When the SteamVac worked, it did a good job cleaning the carpets, however after cleaning ONE carpet and starting a second the brushes stopped rotating. The manual does not give any direction to repair and refers you to a repair shop. It's under warranty, but good luck finding an authorized repair shop. NONE in the RI area.I am very disappointed with the Hoover repair system and am stuck with a new, unusable carpet cleaner."
1,Does not stand up to repeated use,"Yes, this cleans really great when new. But I have replaced the plug in the bottom of the dispensing unit several times now and it is still leaking. I have even replaced the entire top clean water tank. I have had it. I am going to order a Bissell next!"
5,Hoover Steam Vac Dual V w/ scrub tool,I just purchased my steam vac! The instructions could have been more explicit! I steamed two of my Oriental rugs which are both placed in high traffic areas. I must say they came out BEAUTIFUL!!! The steamer was very easy to use. It can also steam bare floors! I haven't tried that yet. All in all I am very pleased!!! It's very good buy! Especially from Amazon since they had the best price!!
5,Best Carpet Cleaner,This carpet cleaner is fantastic! It is so easy to use and it really deep cleans the carpets.
1,Shopper Beware!!! Waste of money,"In fairness to this item, it does clean the carpet great when it works and when the parts don't break. I borrowed this vacuum from my mother and it works wonder the first time. Then the second time I used it the clean water tank split. Thought I did something wrong so I purchased a new water tank for $40. After one use the second water tank split again on the same spot. For a brand name, this vacuum is a waste of money. I would expect a more durable product from Hoover.DO NOT BUY IT!"
3,Clean Water Chamber Flimsy,"We really liked this product, and thought it cleaned well, until the clean water chamber started to break in several places due to the plastic being too thin and flimsy. For that alone I would not recommend it."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"I purchased this product a little over a year and a half ago. The first 2 times I used it it worked very well. After owning the cleaner about 13 months, I went to use it a third time and the brushes didn't rotate any more. I ALWAYS clean the machine and dry everything before storing, only use Hoover soap, and baby the darn thing. I paid $60 to get it fixed, used it once, cleaned and stored it. I pulled it out to use a couple days ago and the brushes won't spin again. I contacted customer no service when it broke the first time and was told ""sorry, the warranty expired last month."" I contacted customer no service at Hoover again this time, and haven't heard a peep. I will NEVER buy from this company again. What a $300 rip off."
2,Cheap plastic,"This worked great on first use. Second use resulted in a broken piece of plastic, but still usable. Next experience was fine. Tried it the other day, leaked all over the place. Don't see a crack, and won't be bothered with it anymore. My new machine will probably not be a hoover."
1,Don't buy!!! Breaks easily!,"We have bought two of these cleaners. The water tank has broken both times within a few uses. After the first one broke, we tried to get a replacement tank at Sears. Since they didn't sell a replacement tank, we bought a whole new cleaner. Well, just when we needed to use the cleaner again, we realized the tank on the second unit is broken. Needless to say, we are extremely frustrated."
1,hoover spin junk,"Don't waste your money. Hoover needs to hire an Engineer.Leaks, clogs, breaks, etc.Junk"
1,Do Not Buy This!,I don't write a whole lot of reviews but I feel the need to warn people about a manufacturing defect in this machine. The bottom of the clean water tank is extremely thin plastic and there's a good chance it will crack over time just with regular use. We've had our machine a little over three years and have probably used it twice a year. Yesterday I filled the tank and it started leaking all over. Turns out the plastic around the valves had cracked. Amazon won't allow links in reviews but if you search for replacement clean water tank and this model you will find hundreds of similar complaints. Some people report being on their 3rd tank. They are $50 a pop to replace! Save yourself the aggrevation and steer clear of Hoover carpet cleaners.
1,"cheap plastic, leaky","Hopeless thing. This is my first steam vac and worked great intially. but after 4-5 uses, problems started appearing. Water tank is made from cheap and fragile plastic, it broke and had to replace with $50. Detergent keeps leaking all the time, hardly able to use. Brushes also stopped working. DON'T BUY THIS."
2,Cleans Well - But Breaks Easily,"This machine cleaned very well for about 30 uses. We were not rough with the machine, but after this many uses the plastic washer and spring mechanism cracked on the clean tank rendering the machine pretty useless. Still saved money over Stanley Steemer for our dogs, but disappointed. The same thing happened to our neighbor's machine.Not only is it 60 bucks to buy a new water canister, but to find a place that actually sells the one you need is just about impossible! I am switching to the Bissell today."
5,Hoover brand steamvac,I have tried other brands of carpet cleaners and the Hoover SteamVac out shines them all. I especially like the rinse feature. No more soap residue left in the carpet.
5,Greatest rug and sofa cleaner ever,"I bought this hoover machine because I was told it could work on all kinds of carpet, but I was really impressed by the features. Unlike other customers, I found no leaking. My carpet dried in a very short time. It was so easy to use. Just like you vaccum. I love the rinsing when you pull back. I used to have a canister bissel, and every time I used it, I would pull the canister over and dump all the dirty water back on my carpet. This machine is so easy to fill, so easy to use and so easy to clean when you are done with it. I can't wait to use it on my sofas. I hate dirty carpets and sofas. So this is the machine for me. I love it. When you use it just take off the hose carrier, it does get in the way. But if you are not using it at the time, no need for it to be on there."
1,Hoover Windtunnel,"I have had my windtunnel for less than a year. At first the Vacuum seemed to do a great job, but as time went on, I noticed the rollers were not turning. I took the vacuum apart to find that the bushings in the rollers had melted the inside of the roller. It does not work so well now."
1,Not what I expected from a Hoover,"Both my mother and I have had hoovers, and we have had the best results from them. I currently live in a one room house with 2 dogs, a cat, and a laundry room with access for the landlords 3 cats that I often vacuum for her. I was immediately impressed by the suction of this vacuum, however after a few months it inevitably locked up and wouldn't work. Like all the other reviewers, we found that not only was it clogged but the plastic had melted and locked up the wheel.I ALSO STRONGLY DON'T RECCOMMEND THE BAGGED, or any bagged with this design. The bag is very small so I end up changing it all the time, and it is very akward to get in. I also read the reviews for the bagless and they had the same problems with melting as the bagged (reccommend you read these also- theres more of them).I am surprised hoover let this vacuum get out their store."
4,It sucks ...... up the dirt,"I really like mine. I have had it a couple of months now, and it works much better than my old one. I like the ability to turn the brushes on and off which works well on my tile. Also the automatically turn off when the handle is fully up, which is great for using the hose on the furniture or baseboards."
1,Overload Problem,"Same problem as RuppMan. Unit less than a year old. Good battery. Tech support tells me that I must have an internal error. Perhaps, but it's not my fault. I won't buy APC again and this was my sixth APC UPS."
2,Overload error,"As several others have reported, this unit is not dependable. Mine went into overload state on the same 400-watt load it had been supporting for about a year. Unplugged everything, it still says overload. The ""warranty"" is to ship it to APC at your own expense, to get a repaired one back. I'm not going to spend fifty bucks to get something that probably won't work any better, so I guess I'll spend [...] bucks to have this safely disposed of."
1,"Another ""overload"" malfunction","Same exact experience as Ruppman and 71 Torino - shows ""overload"" with only 1/5 capacity being used. Will not reset, battery replacement will not help, unit is a costly paperweight. Warranty probably expired (two years old). I could have made a much better purchase for $300.00... Not recommended. (also manuf in Bangladore)Correction: My unit is the RS1500, not the XS1500. That said, units are essentially the same. (differences clearly explained in the RS1500 comments)"
3,A Good Tribute - But You Can't Beat The Real Thing,"There have been about 4 or 5 Madonna Tribute Albums out (Truly Blue, the two Virgin Voices CDs, etc.) and this one is pretty much like them. This CD does have it's good remakes ('Beautiful Stranger,' and the only half-decent remake of 'Like A Prayer' I've heard). But there are some disappointing tracks. There's a reason it's called ""Getting Into The Grooves"" : ""Skin"" , ""Into The Groove"" and a few others are basically just instrumental tracks with little or no lyrical content. This CD is one for the Madonna fan with an open-mind about their Queen's music. So you could like it, love it, or hate it. Buy with an iffy-state of mind!"
1,"bland madonna ""covers""","i'll make this easy. don't waste your money. most of the tracks do not have any vocals and the songs that do are not good. plus, this sudden craze to remake all of madonna's older songs through electronica is getting tired...especially since most of it is not done well."
1,Boring,I got this game for my son's birthday.He only had it for one day and he was asking me to take it back. He did not like it. He found it boring.
2,Not Current,"I agree with the reviews that praised this book a couple of years ago. It is just as good as other O'Reilly quick reference books, but the standard has changed to UML 2.0 and you might want to consider that strongly when you make a purchase. UML 2.0 is not covered in this book."
4,Very useful reference book,"Like O'Reilly's other Pocket Reference books, this book is designed as a quick reference with an ultimate goal of making the reader as productive as possible. It is really useful for people with knowledge of UML but need a quick refresher.I found it to not only be a very quick read, but a good reference on UML syntax and usage. The book is divided up into sections, which cover the various UML diagrams you might encounter. The brief discussion in each section will quickly bring the reader up to speed.Again, if you are already familiar with UML and need a sort of quick reference book, then I would recommend this as an addition to your library. If you are looking for a more thorough UML explanation or are not as comfortable with it as you would like to be, I would recommend a more involved book, like O'Reilly's Learning UML."
4,A much needed reference!,"Wow. I'd been looking for this book. A long overdue additionto the C and C++ pocket reference. This book is just what it said it would be - a UML reference book. Easily fits in thebackpack (or lost on the desk). I look forward to other books written by Mr. Pilone. This one is easy to read, informativeand well worth what I paid for it. It would have been a five star book, but it's a pocket reference!"
3,Plastic containers broken,I bought my first steam vac 2 almost a year ago. I had to take the 1st one back because it lost suction the 2nd time I used it. Then I had the 2nd one about 4 months and the plastic containers started falling apart. First the handles fell off then it just got worse from there. Now I cant use it at all. The only thing is is that it really worked well when its working. I am trying to decide if I should just buy another one. I saw some place that I can buy the containers (top and bottom) but they are like 35.00 a piece. Thats a little expensive. I know I should of done something about it when it first happened but I just borrowed my moms (who has a broken top tank but has it duct taped). Now its probably to late.
1,Don't do it,"There were 4 families in our neighborhood that borrowed the same older Hoover SteamVac for years. No problem. We moved so we purchased a Bissell of our own. They responded by replacing the cheap plastic parts as they broke until the warranty was up. It was a pain it the butt. It was useless after a year and it was only in working condition for a few months.So we decided to go with a Hoover - the new model. BIG MISTAKE.Cheap plastic again. Only Hoover says it our fault the handle broke and the solution container cracked. I'm still fighting them on this.Approximately $50 plus shipping for a new solution container. Looks like it's made out the same plastic as a 2-litre bottle - only worse, it's more brittle. You can't tell me this container makes up a quarter of the cost of the machine.This is seriously flawed product as is most of the competition. The BIGGER PROBLEM is that Hoover does not stand behind it.Beware!!! Sad to say about what used to be a reputable company from my own state."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I loved our first SteamVac, bought in 1997. It was well-made, sturdy, and did the job. The new one we bought last June, however, is a piece of junk. Clearly, the quality Hoover once demanded is out the window.Like others who have complained, we experienced the leaking from day one. Two months in, the handle on the top tank broke, had to duct tape it. Just recently, the handle on the bottom tank broke.There is an inherent design flaw and the top tank does not seat properly. Soap, water and dirty water leak all over floors and outside/inside the machine. Using it is like aversion therapy. We dread it.When I called Hoover this morning to complain, they acted as if this problem doesn't exist, and appeared to not care at all. Didn't even ask for my name, address, purchase info, etc.Today, I am going out to buy a new machine and it won't be a Hoover. If I could rate this lower than one star, I would. Do not buy this machine unless you have money to waste!"
1,Trash,"I've logged less than 5 hours on my steam vac. It's been in the closet for the last six months and when I pulled it out todato fill the water tank, I found that the bottom was rotted out. How can this be??? I kept my vac clean between uses and never stored chemicals in the holding tanks. The manucturer's date on the bottom is August 2003.I've read some of the complaints about this vac and had thought I was alone. My deduction is this... it's a piece of trash. Maytag/Hoover should be ashamed to put this product on the market.I'm a machinist by trade and found that the bottom of the tank where the 'rot' occurred is less than .020 thick. Folks, that's about the thickness of 3 human hairs. I'll follow up this post with a complaint directly to the manufacturer. It's disgusting."
2,Doesn't last more than 6 months,"We bought this carpet cleaner about 6 months ago, and have used it about 5 times since then. After 3 uses, the push-valve on the soap container broke, so we could not put anything in there and have to mix the soap directly in the water container. Just recently, after the 4th use, the push valve to the water tank came loose, so now it leaks water all over the place. The dirty water container on the bottom has always leaked dirty water once you remove it to empty it. We have to use a bucket to carry it to empty so it does not drip dirty water everywhere. Now, after after our last use, the water pump broke and now we can't use the machine at all. What a waste of money! We plan to return it to Hoover, but I don't want a new one, I want my money back! I'd suggest looking into a different brand if I were you."
2,Worked Great! for a very short period of time,"We purchased this unit a little over a year ago for approx. $300. I have a total of 4 rooms that are carpeted in my home so this unit was not overly used. Like other reviews I have read, the top water tank/soap dispenser is leaking the contents quicker than it took to fill it. The seal will not stay in the bottom on the water side. The soap side leaks the same and the seal is tight. The plastic seems to be of less quality than a pancake syrup bottle. I am very disappointed with this product and the local Hoover repair shop that has yet to return my call. I will not have a Hooveriffic day."
2,Worked wonderfully - when it worked,"I've owned several Hoover vacuums, one is over 25 years old and still works perfectly and the other has outlasted even my pricier Kenmore vacuums, so I didn't think twice about purchasing a Hoover steam cleaner. And, as expected, this steam cleaner does a really superb job, when it works. The problem is, it doesn't work very long. The clean water tank cracked first, then the shampoo bottle started to leak, and now the whole maching is literally pouring out water - leaving behind a trail of saturated carpet. In addition, it seems like I spent more time filling and emptying tanks, then I did cleaning. Each tank had to be filled/emptied at least 2x for each medium to large sized room. Hoover really blew it on this model!"
1,What a piece of junk,"I experienced the same problems as the previous reviewer. Have used it 3 times, and the plastic cap on the water holder broke off and leaks water everywhere. Unlike other reviewers, I was not that impressed with how it cleaned. We are getting hardwood floors soon; I am sick of the messy carpet with two dogs and two kids. You may like the job it does right out of the box, but sooner or later it is going to crash because it is plastic junk. No wonder Hoover is downsizing."
4,Dirty Water spills and leaky containers,"I've had this about 6 months and have probably logged 5 hours total on it. The cleaner works great, but if the waste water container gets too foamy (no way to control amout of detergent dispensed), it starts spitting the dirty water back onto the rug. The dirt doesn't show up again until it dries, so its very important to empty the waste water before it indicates.Another problem that has surfaced is that the clean water tank has developed a leak at the bottom valve and becomes a steady stream when the system is running...the net result is water everywhere...making for a slippery mess. I think the system is great, but it takes a while to learn the quirks of this machine."
2,Brittle plastic,I was surprised to see how many people have had the same problem.Our soap/water tank just came apart.We actually got pretty good use out of this item for a year or so then it just started discinegrating!HOW annoying. We have an old dog and are getting ready for our baby to come. We really don't need the expense of having to buy a new carpet cleaner so soon.. but we need it so I guess we have to.How disapointing. I have always had good luck with Hoover products before. Makes you wonder about getting their brand again however after the horrible quality of the cleaner.
1,Hoover really sucks!,"Yep, I have been searching online for replacement parts because the detergent valve broke and the water tank cracked at the handle insertion point. Just for fun, I thought I would check the reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else has had similar problems. After reading these reviews, I don't want to give this company another dime of my hard-earned money. I will never buy another Hoover product again."
1,Falling apart,"Like so many others have already said, the upper water container is defective. First the valve for the small soap container failed, so I had to add the soap directly in the water container. Now the water container valve has failed and whatever water goes in quickly comes out all over the floor. I guess it's time to search the internet for parts since the thing is unusable the way it is. C'mon Hoover, I expect better quality from a brand name like yours."
1,What is shown is not what was sent to me,"One of the pictures is correct but the other is of the smaller chuck-it launcher (13""). In the description it indicates the launcher is 21"" long (which is what I was looking for). I received a 13"" launcher. I have just contacted the seller for next steps. Very annoyed."
1,Wrong Product Description,"In the description it indicates the launcher is 21"" long. Instead they shipped me one that is 13.5 inches long. I can get that at any pet store. It was the 21"" unit that made me order this. Amazon should fix this product description. Do not order if you want the 21"" model."
4,"Provocative, intense, thought-provoking.","One of the better offerings of the arthouse genre. From my reading, I have noticed that critics have been quite divided in their assessment of this film. Good! It has provided food for thought. I find it honest and heartfelt. Not its least attraction is its exquisite photography. Muti's fallen angel 'Cass' has never been displayed more beautifully and the beach scenes are impeccable. Gazzara is completely believable as the the world-weary poet who neglects his talent in favour of indulging in alcoholic and sexual excess. The poetry he recites is terrific. I hope viewers who enjoy this film are encouraged to read more of Bukowski's work. The film is sensitive, has a solid musical score and captures the spirit of Bukowskis work. A tragicomic delight."
3,"SAD, FASCINATING,POETIC,SPELLBINDING","I just first saw 'Tales Of Ordinary Madness' yesterday. I like this film. At times living through the eyes of Charlie seems gluemy and useless, but I'm constantly fascinated and wondering the outcome. I only brought this film because I'm a hugh fan and LOVE Ornella Muti, but I'm glad I've had the chance to see this film. I recommend this film. And not just because Ornella is in it.Although it does't hurt because Ornella is really good in this film. Ornella is just beautiful as always but her acting always leaves me wanting/craving for more. If your a Ornella Muti fan this should definitely be in your collection. But other than that this film is fascinating but if you havn't seen this film don't expect a uplifting, happy film. This film may not be for every one.By Justine Ryan"
4,"Not As Good As Barfly, but Worth Watching","The best films showcasing the world of Charles Bukowski were Barfly, Love Is A Dog From Hell (Crazy Love), and Tales of Ordinary Madness. Although Ben Gazzara resembles Buk, he never captures his sense of life as Mickey Rourke so brilliantly did in Barfly. Still, this moody film is worth seeing -- but only if you are a fan of Charles Bukowski."
4,"Bars, Whores, and More Bars and Some Hillarity","Gazara shows his range in this LA montage of bars, whores, and more bars. I liked the story and its wandering plot. The NY job scene alone is a riot. The ending, though, does not feel very Buk-like."
5,Not a review of the game.,"I received the Mutate figurine when I preordered the collector's edition of Prey. The item is no longer available at Amazon or anywhere else it seems.It's ok but not quite as well-crafted as the figurines I received with my copies of Doom 3 (Pinky Demon, Baron of Hell, and Mancubus for those who are wondering). Still I'm glad to have two of them (I preordered two copies of the collector's edition) as well two sets of the other figurines also."
3,Missing Figure,"If you've purchased the Limited Edition Prey for the XBox 360, you are aware it comes with 2 out of 3 figurine. This is the missing figurine. Complete your collection and buy it."
3,"Prey, ok, but could have been better....","I played this game for awhile but lost interest. It does have some innovative features (portals, ability to become ""spirit"" at certain points). But overall I found it to be pretty much a copy of Doom and UT as well as other FPS games. I have the two figurines that came with the limited edition box. But, wouldn't waste anymore money on anything to do with this game at this point."
2,One trick pony,"OOO... Portals. Aside from walls textured with photos from a lower G.I. exam this game has nothing new to offer. The storyline is dull and plodding and the hero is hard to empathize with. The dismally small array of weapons includes uninspired gems like; a machinegun, a slightly large machinegun, and grenades. Prey mimics other games like Unreal Tournament, and Half Life, it just doesn't do it very well. Save your money, wait till it's a $9.99 ""classic."""
1,Save the time and the money,"This book summarizes a lot of trivial knowledge that is known and can be obtained from books by people who have a lot more to say. If you need to find out how the web works read Nielsen, if you want to find out about how communities work read Philip's and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing by Philip Greenspun. If you are an executive, read them anyway. Both are very well written and a pleasure to read, making them a fast read as well. Then come back and find out whether this can teach you any more - chances are it won't."
5,Black Widow (1955)l,"This is an excellent film. A gripping murder story, it is well directed, expertly cast and very well acted, especially by Peggy Ann Garner as the murder victim. Ginger Rogers si in good form as a bitchy actress, and Van Heflin and George Raft do excellent work as the chief suspect and a police detective. Gene Tierney is as lovely and stylish ss she always was in her movies. The transfer, from the original CinemaScope print, is splendid. Nice t0 see it again after more than 50 years"
5,Noir Gem in Grand and Colorful Cinemascope!!!,"Fox's Film Noir Series has its titles that stand out. This is one of them. As I started watching this film, I had a hard time believing it could be characterized as noir. But as the film progressed, it became apparent. What starts out as a bubbly 50's romp devolves into an intriguing mystery that keeps you guessing. Dutifully played by veteran actors, the characters in this film are sure to entertain. Not at all what I expected! And the extras are fun too! Check it out if you can. And as of this writing, it is at a great price!"
4,the black widow,i thought this was one of the best movies of the late fifties ginger rodgers wasgreat i recommend this movie to everyone who likes mysteries and buy it from amazon.com
3,"Not noir, but not bad","First, although this is part of the Fox Noir series, it's not noir. It's shot in color, brightly lit, mostly done on stages, and has no ""hard boiled"" or low life characters. It's a slick ""Who done it,"" and a reasonably enjoyable one. You can read some of the other reviews for more details on the story and cast. Fox gives us a nice bunch of extras in this DVD -- good commentary and two nice featurettes on Gene Tierney and Ginger Rogers. It's far from a classic, but it's a pleasant way to spend an evening."
4,IN THE BEST WHO-DUNNIT TRADITION,"Younger viewers would be unfamiliar with the type of story telling which needs a little concentration and attention to plot development. Black Widow leads us into a situation few of us would want to experience. Being involved more and more deeply in something out of our control, finally being suspected of murder. I saw this movie when it was released over 50 years ago and it still holds interest for me today."
2,Not worth the money,I have used carnauba waxes for years. This is the first time and probably the last I use P21S. There are too many other carauba waxes that do a better job at a much lower cost!
5,out of the classroom,"I have been watching, listening to, and reading information about marriage for many years. Never before have I gotten so lost in a marriage book that I hated to put it down. In DNA for Couples the lost art of story-telling is found. As you read about the lives of these other couples, you will find yourself understanding your own relationship better. It feels like the authors have taken the subject of marriage out of the classroom and put it into the living room where it belongs. Just when I thought every marriage book was going to be a revamping of all the others, I waded into this one and realized that there are new ideas and better ways to present them. What a breath of fresh air. You've gotta give this one a try. It is amazing!"
5,This book gives you the tools to make a great marriage!,"My small group from church is going through this book and it has really given us some practical tools to apply to our marriage. A lot of books out there give you very encouraging things, but not real techniques to use everyday. If you take this book to heart and really practice the tools with your spouse it can take your marriage from good to great. My husband and I have found this book so helpful and has made our marriage so much more enjoyable."
5,interestingly enough...,"interesting that amazon would want me to review this product...i ordered this video for my son for christmas...it arrived, i wrapped it, and set it under the tree...well, when he opens it christmas day, he's excited because he is a hardcore pink panther fan...however, when he opens the dvd case, the pink panther movie was not inside...instead, there was a dvd of ""the princess bride""!...so, my son is bummed out and stuff, but my wife is pumped, cause she loves the princess bride...so, she decided to keep the movie, and we went to get my son another dvd during the after christmas sales events...as far as the pink panther is concerned, you can't go wrong...classic cartoons are the best by far!...they contain no suggestive themes or slang words or reality violence...just plain fun!...as far as amazon is concerned, they are a reliable company striving to offer us the best product at the best price...but we all make mistakes...i just thought it was a funny story..."
4,Takes me back,"Loved it as a kid, Forgot he smokes a ciggarette in a holder in a couple of episodes. My kids enjoyed it"
4,"Great collection, no wait","Giving this one star because of a typo in the date of release? Please. I was thrilled to be able to watch my favorite childhood cartoons, and my kids love them, too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because there is no Ant and the Aardark included."
4,Brings back memories,"The kids watch it over and over and it brings back memories for me.The comics themselves are very simplistic, very little dialog and such. But that is what makes it great. Just good old fashion humor."
5,Pink Panther,"I purchase this for my grandaughter as a gift. She saw an episode on tv and fell inlove with Pink. He is one funny panther. The sound quality is fantastic and the picture clear and complements the funny eisodes. Family members also watched this and we just broke out in some hard laughs very creative he is and funny. The seller delivered quickly and in good condtion. I have since purchase others of Pink. Go ahead and treat youself to some good ole' cartoon fun, you will be pleased."
3,Kondo rocking,"While not as powerful as ""Brain War"" that was to follow some time later in 1991 , this is still a good album that reveals Kondo's personal style in playing trumpet and accentuates on the strong punk-jazz idiom that will culminate later .Three and a half star material , actually."
2,Hmmmmmm,"Bought another one of these from the same vendor; a spray can - much better. This thing seems cheap. When you open it, you can see it is just a vitamin bottle glued in upside down. And it being cardboard, after a couple openings, it seems flimsy. Find the metal can-spray."
4,Good item but...,"Is a good item, but I think that fails a bit because it has nothing to put inside to prevent, for example, that if you put in coins, rings, etc, if you shake the can, content moves inside and do noise of coin, ring, etc."
1,"Do not bother, a nice piece of junk !!!","I am writing this review just after opening the bottom part of the can with a bleeding finger. They have not even provided instruction how to open and use this product......I am wondering how can such a product receive such a glorious review. I was misled by glowing review at amazon and compelled to buy it hoping that it would be a great item to store my valuables. Yes i agree, it looks like the original ajax bleach box. But i am wondering, why we need to use such copy item when there are more than enough original junk (original bleach box or similar item)laying around us everywhere. A nice way to dump out hard earned money !!!"
4,an early gem from the dawn of sound,"King Vidor (""The Big Parade"", ""The Crowd"", ""Show People"") was one of the first major Hollywood studio directors to feature an all-African-American cast in this visually striking film from M-G-M in 1929. Produced in the first full year of sound production, Vidor's film (like Rouben Mamoulian's ""Applause"" released the same year)manages to avoid the staginess and overcome many of the technical limitations inherent in the early talkies. Forget the stereotype-laden plotline: the lust for a city vamp (Nina Mae McKinney)leads a sharecropper-turned-preacher (Daniel L. Haynes) astray--this film gets 4 stars for its climactic sequence alone: a bravura expressionistic chase through a fog-shrouded swamp that is worthy of Murnau or Lang at their best--definitely worth a look!"
2,Amos and Andy dialog,"This film is a depiction of black people in the souththat isn't much like what they were like historically, but is like what white culture stereotyped them.The music and dance is the best of this movie.The plot like the dialog is bad: the country cotton picker is shucked like corn by the city slicker woman and her friends in the fast crowd."
3,Good One!!,What a gem of a movie! I purchased it only because I wanted to see more of Nina Mae McKinney and it was certainly worth it. The extra footage of the Nicholas brothers makes this one a keeper!
4,Cuts great!,I am not crazy about the feel of the handle on this knife but it cuts great! It feels kind of light and hollow at the handle--maybe I'm used to a heavier handle BUT it slices and cuts as well or better than any knife I've had. I've used it on all types of fruits and veggies and even a cake with hard fondant icing and it made quick clean cuts.
2,crappy covers,"The only reason that I bought this was the price. I think that I have 60% of these songs in different compilations, and will just build a compilation from my original artists' versions, only using the covers where I have holes iin my collection."
2,Hitler and the Nazis,"Not that interesting the three videos are somewhat boring.The cross and star sucked badly and the Eye of Vichy, you had to read the whole movie because in was in French, it was decent except for the fact of langauge.The Archticture of Doom was alright but I already owen it.Mostly stock war footage, that I have seen before.The title is somewhat deceiving, but its my own fault for not reveiwing the biography."
3,"Expensive, small, useful","I purchased the Warn rigging kit to use with my portable Warn PullzAll Cordless winch. I was expecting a good sized case that might hold other gear as well, however, this is case is just large enough to hold the strap and hardware. Even though the Amazon price is competitive, this product is overpriced. The individual parts in it cost about the same when purchased separatly as they do in the kit so no savings here."
5,"Come Slowly, Eden","Come Slowly, EdenCharlene Keels pens a sensual erotic story about students at Florida State University and their rites of coming into adulthood. From Tom a shy virgin freshman, his savvy roommate, grass dealer, ,and party animal to Amanda Carey, a poor woman who worked two part time jobs with a risque night job, was leagues ahead of anyone at the college, it is Julie Carson, the freshman southern belle that captured my heart even though she was the spoiled only daughter of prominent state supreme judge.The book starts slow as the author introduces the characters but once they all appear the book comes together perfect and is a MUST READ!"
5,Gets out the smells and stains,"The Hoover SteamVac worked really well in getting out old stains. I have a dog, and it got rid of old stains that no amount of hand scrubbing could get rid of. The carpet smells fresh now, and did a terrific job of removing old pet odors. It is very easy to use, and not bulky at all. However, if you think you want to clean your stairs or upholstry you might be better off getting a more expensive model that includes a hose attachment. This machine is great if you already have one of the portable units to do your furniture and stairs, and you just want something to clean large portions of your carpet."
5,The Rocky Mountain Berry Book,"The amount of information packed into this little paperback book is incredible! This is not the usual vague, dry field guide since Bob Krumm writes about wild berries from his own personal experience. The descriptions of the plants, info on where to find them, color pictures, and cautions about poisonous plants and wild animals make it possible for even the most inexperienced berry pickers to safely find these little treasures. The hints and recipes from diverse sources make this book unique - it's more than a field guide,and more than a cookbook. I love this book."
3,Take a Cruise with Jeanne Crain,"This is a fun little film that keeps building in suspense until the final payoff. The cast is competent and attractive and the production is pretty much first-rate. The mini feature about the making of Dangerous Crossing is interesting, as it explains how movie production in the old studio days was incredibly fast. To think this movie was filmed in 19 days, with the polished look of an A-picture, even though it was filmed with a B-picture budget. Sets from Gentleman Prefer Blondes and Titanic were reused making the film seem more prestigious than it really was. An important film for Jeanne Crain (who looks beautiful) fans, Dangerous Crossing won't disappoint."
4,Dangerous Crossing,"Dangerous Crossing is a little known and short Film Noir and carries itself well. The acting abilities of it's featured artists Jeanne Crain and Michael Rennie are believable and the actors who pull together to make sure Miss Crain's character seems to be going out of her mind do a superb job. Note the stewardess' who is helping her lover(the husband of Miss Crain), it is Kathryn Grant (future wife to Bing Crosby - 1957). It's well worth the viewing."
3,A Fun Example of the Genre,"""Dangerous Crossing"" was not intended to be a great movie, nor is it. But it is a lot of fun and incorporates many of the characteristics of its genre. The acting is good, the plot fun (with a twist), and the ship setting creates a special atmosphere. I recommend this film, and the DVD is of very good quality."
2,please stop the fog horn,"l read the other reviews before l bought....well l am sorry but l love british mysteries but this one was so boring....dark ship, fog, woman looking, looking, and the fog horn never stops...yes the end is ok but the getting there is way, way too long....l really fast forwarded some places just to boring, spend money on another please."
3,Fair,"Jeanne Crain is the best. This is basically a one-woman play with her as the star. So if you're a big JC fan, then get it. The restoration job by Fox is good. Why aren't they doing more of these in widescreen?!The movie is just fair. Nothing special in the dialogue. The constant foghorn effect gets really monotonous. The plot is pretty ridiculous. There are some good visuals though."
3,"good, but not quite as good as i remembered","this is a movie i've waited years to see again. i totally enjoyed it for that reason. also there is commentary that i really enjoyed. i like jeanne crain, so i enjoyed her. but you can tell that they made this movie really quickly. the dialogue's not great. and the performance is a bit overboard in places. but i still thoroughly enjoyed it and am glad that i was finally able to see it again."
3,NOT ONE OF JEANNE'S BEST,"AS MUCH AS I HAVE LOVED MISS CRAIN FOR YEARS, THIS IS NOT ONE OF HER BETTER MOVIES. I HAD NEVER SEEN THIS ONE AND ORDERED IT SIGHT UNSEEN WHEN IT WENT ON SALE. IT'S VERY INTERESTING, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER AND ENDS A LITTLE QUICKLY."
3,Dangerous Crossing (Fox Film Noir),This movie was bought as a gift. My stepfather requested it.I have to say he is enjoying it.
4,Basic webcam - serves the purpose at a great price . . .,"This Xbox 360 Live Vision Camera was well worth the $10 price. It is a ""no-frills"" camera that is a true ""plug-and-play"" for the Xbox 360 and serves its purpose well . . . for our 12-year-old son to ""see"" his friends while playing on Xbox Live. An added benefit is that it also allows us (his parents) to ""see"" who our son is gaming with. Comes with an extra-long USB connection cord, has both auto-focus and manual focus adjustment, adjusts well to minimal background lighting, and allows for snap-shot pictures which can be used as a personal avatar and even inserted into some Xbox games as an overlay for the characters. I would recommend this product"
5,GREAT!!!,"Hey it works and its pretty good, also works with PC apparently, i'll give it a try. bought 2!! 1 used and the other new!! Well worth it!!"
3,Parents buying for kids please read.,"I got this for christmas (i asked for it) and to be honest, its not very satisfying. It comes with a code for the game UNO which is fun. Any parent with a younger child, beware people aren't always clothed or showing very nice pictures on the UNO game. You can turn the other peoples video off so you can't see it."
3,Not so great picture quality but better than most in low light,"This camera has mediocre color. Has an unnatural green tint compared to my other 2 cameras. However, in very low light conditions it had the best picture quality. If you do not need a camera for low light conditions, I'd probably get something else that has more natural color. Mine also had a handful of pixels that were dead. For the price the camera is okay but the greenish tint is a bit annoying. The room I am in uses CF bulbs. Have not tried it in natural light or daylight."
3,Service satisfaction,"The article I received was not as i expected HOWEVER I contacted the seller and he quickly remedated the situation by giving me a full refund,trusting i would return the unwanted item,which i have done so. I was pleased with the quickness of his actions and although dissappointed the item was not what i expected I would recomend this seller."
3,xbox vision 350,"useful, it will be better when it's more mainstreamed and more people have it and use it and when there's more games that use it."
3,Good Family Fun,"Pretty decent game, isnt all i hoped it would be but then again the vision camera was kind of a gimmicky product 2 begin with. U can have good clean family fun however. Yet it wont last no more than 2 to 3 months which is solod in any case. I just wish the game had more varied instances to keep it going."
4,Works great even in low light,Great little unit. Allows for the use of video in the older games that don't recognize the Kinect camera. I would recommend leaving the settings on auto if you play in low light as it seems to be able to give a better image overall than the manual settings. Only reason for 4 stars is that the focus ring is a pain. You wind up moving the camera almost every time you are trying to adjust it and it is hard to get adjusted properly without a second person there to sit in your location while you twist it.
3,Xbox 360 Live Vision Camera,"Bought this solely to add my face to my Rainbow 6 character. Once it was captured it went back in the box. This is not a high resolution camera 640x480. Great for playing around, wouldn't try to use for video communication though."
4,Great for XBOX 360 and PS3,I bought this camera about a year ago and was going to buy the PS3 camera and the XBOX camera works with both XBOX and PS3 systems. Works fine on both.
3,Xbox Live camera,I bought this product for the Imac to video chat with others on-line. The camera works but the only down fall is that there is no built in mic on the camera. But for the price it works just fine. The picture quality is OK......Thanks
2,GREAT Webcam,"I actually do not use this webcam for XBOX. I have a MAC laptop that does not have a built in camera (its a Powerbook) and waned a Webcam. This one is GREAT because it is one of the few (and maybe the only) webcam that you can actually just plug in and use right away on a MAC! There are tons of cameras out there, but almost none of them work on a MAC. I would totally tell anyone with a MAC to get this camera! P.S. I can't change the stars on this rating, but I would TOTALLY rate this camera a 5."
1,this is not a game.,"This is advertised as a Webcam not a game. The seller sends you a game ""in the movies"" worth $19.00. You do not get what you pay for. You pay $34.00 for a Webcam, headset and trial version of XBOX live and you get a game, no headset, no trial version of XBOX live. This is a ripoff. I complained to Amazon and they did nothing. I complained to the seller and got no response."
3,Live Vision Cam,This is not fun using. I thought you would have the ability to record video footage but you can't.
4,Convient Cheaply priced webcam,"I just got this mostly for it's video chat & webcam ability. Other than this all I have is a polaroid camera collecting dust, so the xbox vision really helps when I want new pictures today. The video feature is a easy to use with windows movie maker, you'll have new photo & videos for youtube and myspace with audio in less than a half hour when you learn how to use it.Works with a microphone headset or a mic, and actually it comes with a headset but you'll need a separate headset for pc, I use logitech. Overall I recommend it & say it's a best buy. Read the booklet provided for setup instructions."
2,Dissapointed,I got the cam but was hoping it would come with a mic instead it came with the game and no mic or month live. Oh well
3,Pretty Good.,This is not really a necesity but more of a luxury. It can't be used with every game. The only reason why I purchased it was because you can take pictures of yourself and put them on your licenses in a couple racing games. Not really a necesity but if you have the money to get it then it will serve its purpose.
3,"Nice camera, but MS doesn't max its potential","I was on the fence about this camera, but decided to go for it when I read that it can also be used on a PC. This is my first webcam and I've had a lot of fun with it. That being said, there isn't much on LIVE that you can use it with unless you love UNO for long periods. The lack of titles that can use this camera should deter anyone who wants to be anonymous on LIVE and not reveal your mug. Of course, you could point the camera at something else and still play the few games out there."
4,Don't use for outdoor camera!,"I purchased this camera on the basis of online reviews saying it was great, and I wanted a camera with manual focus, and I didn't need a mic. However, I planned to use it pointed out the window, and the outdoor light blows out the picture - strangely enough, it is ok to a point at which it suddenly is completely overexposed (could be mac driver under os x leopard, or internal to the camera).So, it works as advertised I believe, indoors - but don't subject it to extremely bright light, the type which is common out the window with full sun or snow cover under sunlight."
5,A Great Xbox 360 Add-On,"I have used this camera in video chats and interactive games, and it works great in both! It also works well as a PC web camera if you don't already have one."
5,xbl vision camera,"great little web camera. I am always more clear than anyone I am webcamming with. it's easy to use and has a nice green led ring when hooked up to the xbox 360. it comes with a free 1 month xbl, free uno subscription and a free xbl headset. for the price, this camera is a 10/10"
3,It's an OK product that could use some updates,"Decent product that could have better resolution and more features. It is however, a good value for the price. Setup was very simple."
1,"Just Bought, Just returned it","I just bought the Hoover Windtunnel Bagless for [money] at [my local department store] and...i just returned it. The vacuum started sparking and smoking after using it for about 12 minutes. The people at [my local department store] said that they ""never had this problem with this model"". After so many positive reviews, including from Consumer Reports, I am thinking about giving this model another chance, but...we'll see."
2,Stinky!,"It actually started off as a good vacuum...Good suction and I liked the bagless feature...But not even six months after I had bought it, it started stinking up the whole house with the smell of burning rubber. I did everything I could to try and fix it, but nothing worked. I returned that one for another (identical) one and about nine months later the exact same thing happened. This time I am dumping it in the trash and buying a completely different brand. I gave it two stars because it worked pretty well for the first few months, but unless you are a vacuum repair man, I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,not pleased,We bought this after moving into our new home...new house=new dirt=new vacuum...lol...well needless to say i was thrilled to turn it on and use it for the first time...vacuuming was enjoyable...the first time anyway!!! After that the vacuum couldnt be used for more than 10 minutes before it would overheat and turn itself off...and not able to run again for 20+ minutes!!...Nothing like trying to clean your house and the vacuuming alone would be a all day thing...i was VERY disappointed :(
4,Not really steam,"Work very well, but the only ""steam"" is how hot the water is that you fill the tank with."
4,Great Machine as Always!!!,"Ok first--I have two small children and a farm. I use my steam vac ALOT. I mean ALOT. Once a week if we are on vacation. Seriously, I use the Steam Vac until it dies of exhaustion...I have had 2 Steam Vacs in 5 years. They were both Hoover's and are just fantastic.I do have ONE issue with this machine. I prefer the spin brush hand held tool. This hand tool is wonderful for some things but I have ALOT ALOT ALOT of GRIMY NASTY stairs. My first Hoover Steam Vac had a spin brush hand tool. This machine does not and I have found that to be problematic. You just can't get the grime out of those stairs without some scrub... Also, I have some problems even getting the hand tool attached properly.I am moving on to the All-Terrain model. But this is a nice machine, especially for a ranch style home.WORKS GREAT ON WOOD AND TILE FLOORS TOO."
5,A great devotional overview of the minor prophets,"This book is an excellent introduction to the minor prophets if you are unfamiliar with them, and a fantastic resource to get to know them better if you are already acquainted with them. It's arranged in one page daily devotional format chapters that summarize the chapter and highlight an applicable point. Often times daily devotionals suffer from out of context verses and/or a heavy emphasis on reader response interpretation instead of authorial intent.This book suffers from neither of those pitfalls, it is thouroughly exegetical, (it really brings out the meaning of the text) as well as devotional (encourages the reader towards love and good works).David Guzik's written resources have been a great blessing to my studies these past 4 years and I trust that this book will help you to understand these often overlooked books, as well as spur you on to a nearer and truer walk with the Lord.-Mike Neglia-"
2,Mustek Adventure DV3 NOT Mac Compatible,"I bought this camera for a birthday gift. Since no one has this in a store, one really has to trust the advertising. It is a solid little camera, really, but don't be fooled by the MPEG-4 advertising. It will not be compatible with either Quicktime or iMovie on a Mac. It saves files as a .asf, which you will need a video converter to convert to use on a Mac. You might get lucky on a PC, but even then the files were compressed using a weird ""codec"" and there was additional software plug-ins needed. If you are not a tech geek, avoid this camera."
5,Great Camera!,"The Mustek Adventure DV3 camera is fantastic. The battery life is long, outside video was fantastic, and the camera is wonderful. Only one problem found: mp3 player only lasts 25 minutes on new batteries. I added a 512 M SD card for 30 bucks. I still can't believe the camera w batteries, shipping and tax was just $84."
4,NOT ON THE TOP BUT CLOSE TO IT,"THIS LITTLE CAMERA AND CAMCORDER IS VERY USEFUL FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS, THE ONLY KICKBACK IS THAT IT MUST BE USED IN A VERY LIGHTED AREA........OTHER THAN THAT IS A A GREAT INVESTMENT....."
3,a bit long,"I could have stood for this book to be a bit shorter. It was fairly predictable, with a surprise about Dale's childhood thrown in. I got a little tired of the ""will-they-or-won't they"" and was just ready for them to get together already."
2,My rating,"I've done a lot of cryptic puzzles. These are too dry in their clues. Many others that I have been challenged by are more ""playful"" or ""cute"" in their unraveling. The Mensa book, Frank Rich's of The Nation magazine to name 2 were much more fun.These are just plain hard and don't give me nearly the same sense of pleasure doing them.Maybe it's a British thing."
3,More Challenging than Traditional Crossword Puzzles,"This was purchased for my husband who is an avid crossword puzzle fan. He does them in several different newspapers daily - in pen - and completes them. However, he seemed a little intimidated by this particular book and style of puzzle. I notice he picks it up every once in a while and does one - but he doesn't seem to enjoy the challenge as much as I thought he might! So, if your crossword puzzle lover is used to the New York Times crossword puzzles and such, you may be better off to stick with those."
5,Not just for the beginner,Steve and Megumi Biddle seem to have collected a nice array of contemporary folds; I would rank a few of these as high-intermediate. This is one book that I'm happy to have in my collection and I heartily recommend it.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Perhaps the mistake I made was basing my expectations of this book upon the ratings and reviews and others. I think I may have expected too much from this book. Though it kept my interest and I enjoyed the perspective of adultery we get from the protaginst, I felt there was something missing in her and the story as a whole. By the time I finished the book, I was left needing more than the story and main character gave."
5,A real sexy read!,Both lyrical and sensitive this book has a whole new outlook on adultery and its motives!A must for all husbands who wonder what their wives are doing in their afternoons.
2,Lacking,"I purchased this book with the intention of having a thorough reference guide for my 2000 TL. I was quicklly disappointed and surprised when 95% of what I referenced was not available, or lacked so much detail that it offered no assistance at all. This book may be a gem for integra owners (most of the examples and instructions are integra focused) but TL and RL owners beware, and take a peek at it in the stores before you commit. You could be highly disappointed."
1,"Overrated , stay away from this subjective review","Margo Jefferson hits a low point in her career. If you look beyond the factual blunders (like not even getting Mrs. Katherine Jacksons maiden name right) and getting dates of events wrong (where was the publisher's fact checker? Or was this piece sent out the door ASAP while the MJ topic was still hot?) there's still plenty to be said of the overall sarcastic tone of this book. You'd hope 13 years after the Oprah interview, the thought of Michael Jackson sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber would be abolished. Margo Jefferson used remote and outdated sources to help her describe Jackson family members. I wish she'd spent some time with the Jackson family members. A far more positive, truthful and entertaining book would be on the shelves today. One of a family with incredible talent on many levels, togetherness, unity, faith, love & laughter. For those who're still interested in the book I suggest the libary so you don't waste your money."
3,Elegant Prose with Michael at the Center,"This Pulitzer prizing-winning author has an elegant way with words and a turn of a phrase. She strives to place Michael in the center of what was culturally happening at the time of his ascendancy and subsequent decline (at least in the press; his fans remained loyal). However if someone is looking for a book of Michael this is not the one. This book is ""about"" Michael or rather on how Michael affected, was perhaps affected by, and perceived by the culture in which we live from the standpoint of how our society has always treated the freak, the oddity, the thing that is different from the ""norm"". This very slim book is a good and quick read. One complaint, the author got a couple of her facts wrong and for me that takes a little away from the book. Especially, when they were facts that are well-known and easily checked."
2,I agree w/ moonlighter,"I am a Michael Jackson fan and was thrilled when I saw this at the store. I read it and read it but there was really nothing new for me. Some of the info isn't correct (like someone else said, the dates aren't right sometimes). It is clearly for the non-fan who isn't familiar with Michael Jackson at all. If you're a non-fan I would suggest reading this if you want to understand MJ better. But for the fan I'd pass."
2,who's bad?,this is a tremendous piece of writing. unfortunately i waited over a month for it despite expedited shipping.
3,A biographer's perspectives of Michael Jackson,"7/4/09 the *copyright page*(Page 1) of the book(ISBN 0375423265),(Publishers:Random House,2006) describes exactly the 5(five) categories that the book covers: :1.*""criticism and interpretation""...2.*""psychology"":motives and methods of various entertainers as interpreted by the author based on her research (Notes,Pgs 139-144).... 3.*""popular music""...4.*""social aspects""....5.*""popular culture""..... and their influences."
2,No Literary Value,"If this is a real bio on a superstar who has been an entertainer for over 40 years - it seems it would call for more than 160 pages. With that said, this book is not the worse book out there on Michael Jackson. Yet, I would not recommend this book because the author crosses the line with playing doctor with her opinion and besides that, there's no literary value here!"
1,Typical Buffon Writer,"a 137 pages on Michael jackson??? it takes 78 pages alone to write about Off the wall&Thriller's Impact alone still to this day. this is some Buffon writing,but a non talented,half hearted hack who has no business writing books at all.another generic fast Buck at the expense of Michael Jackson.folks need to leave the Brother alone."
1,Horrible,This book was just awful. It included no new information (and in fact quite a bit of inaccurate information) and was very poorly written. It was difficult to read and not at all worth the money I spent on it.
1,another person who dares,"Ms. Jefferson does not take definite position on whether Mr. Jackson is a child molester. Good grief, another person who dares write about someone with failure to research. This gets tiring. The facts regarding Michael's innocence have been out a few years. All she had to do is go on the internet. How dare her. Michael's true honor is coming forth despite so much ignorance, false judgment and the perverse sensationalism over Michael Jackson."
5,This book makes learning the Bible fun and interesting!,Let's face it . . . preschoolers do not have a long attention span. The Bible stories provided in this book are not only educational but they are kept to 2 or 3 pages. . . just long enough to spark the child's interest. They also provide faces to the characters which helps the child to remember the stories. My daughter and I have enjoyed the this book as well as the Beginner's Bible videos. Reading this book to your child will give them a great start in their christian lives.
2,Very disappointing - Not Mr. Beers best,"I purchased both V. Gilbert Beers' ""Preschoolers Bible"" and ""Early Readers Bible"" for my niece. They were very similar in text, illustrations, reading level, and layout, but the ""Early Readers Bible"" was vastly superior. I tried to return the ""Preschoolers Bible"" but with shipping costs it would have cost me as much to return as it did to purchase it in the first place! A very disappointing purchase, and I already know which will become one of her favorite books, and which will languish unread. Not recommended, there are better children's bibles out there, even by the same author."
2,Leaves you hanging,"My 3 1/2 year old son enjoys reading this bible BUT he asks a lot of questions because the stories are too simple, lack depth and kind of leave you hanging. I'm searching for a new bible that has more details with accurate information in it. His language skills are advanced so that is part of it but also just reading it to him makes me feel like I'm not telling him accurate information because the important pieces have been left out."
2,Very disappointing,"This edition of the Bible definitely deals with concepts... and that's about it.The stories are so over-simplified, they are not even interesting.No 3-yr-old wants to listen to this (p. 119):""Some people listen to Moses. They want to follow God. That makes them happy. But others want to worship the statue. God punishes those people. Now everyone knows that God is the One to worship.""Come on, kids deserve better writing than that.And the present tense is just awful!Stories should not be in present tense; it's not clever or meaningful, and it sounds ridiculous.I can't recommend this at all.I gave it 2 stars only because it is a Bible, making it inherently better than a lot of the trash out there."
1,Bike manufactured incorrectly,"While assembling this bike, my husband discovered the mainframe was incorrectly manufactured. The front bar, leading from the handlebars down to the front wheel, was manufactured too narrowly. This makes it impossible to put the front wheel on. We took it to a pro-bike shop and even they were not able to stretch the steel frame apart enough to insert the front wheel. This is a poorly manufactured bike and I will not purchase a Huffy again. After this experience, I would strong recommend against purchasing a bike online."
4,needs better organization,"Very good information...once you find what you're looking for. It is organized by zip code, which makes searching difficult. Especially for larger cities that encompass a variety of zip codes. Good book, but could be improved."
4,"Neglected book parallels ""Titanic""","I read this book about 8 years ago and enjoyed it immensely; it was one of those riveting page turners which are so hard to find these days. It came back to me after seeing the movie Titanic, because I was reminded of various parallels between the two stories; notably the uncovering of an woman's mysterious background set aboard the great ship. It also centred on the enigma of that most mysterious of ships. It reignited my interest in the story and I was desperate to read the book. Unfortunately it appears to be out of print. It seems an ideal moment to release the book and capitalise on the renewed interest in the Titanic phenomenon. I would be very interested in finding out more about the book and it's author, Donald Stanwood. Any feedback would be much appreciated."
5,A great book for foodies and history buffs alike,"This lovely book brings a slice of Hungarian Jewish culture to life in a uniquely three-dimensional way - the sights, the tastes, the details of everyday life. I found the recipes easy to follow and the pictures charming. The author's great-grandmother whom he profiles here is a refreshingly complex character - her views about such things as religion and national identity change over time, along with historical changes, and some of these shifts are even reflected in her food! For example, this is one Hungarian cookbook that is light on the paprika - apparently ginger was the spice of choice in the 19th century. Who knew?"
3,racing galore,"filled with cool racing scenes and Grieco's wanna be James Dean attitude. though I think Grieco ripped off Dean's red jacket. some scenes are lame as hell. the lead actress is hot(fogot her name) but she is hot hot hot. Born To Run is for the dragracing fans and fans of the cars and the ladies, yeah. fun for a while. the ending is good to."
2,tampa bay blanket,"This product is not in stock. it is the older model of the blanket and if you order it like i did, then you will get a different model which is newer. its ok, but i didnt like it as much as the one pictured here."
3,Why so obscure?,"I'm surprised this book isn't more well-known as it is extremely controversial, everything you know about Christ was wrong: he was in many ways an ordinary man and the evil fanaticism of the Apostle Peter has created a suffocating, tyrannical Catholic Church.I agree with the above cusomer in that I wanted to know how much of this was fact, since Barnaby Williams has apparently based this book on his research. Williams really should have written a note as too what he fabricated, and what he discovered.I did not finish the book however, as I found it stodgy and depressingly violent. An earlier appearance of Jesus Christ would have held my interest."
2,no title,"Very odd, makes me wonder how this book ever got published in the first place, doesn't really make the Amazon appealing. It almost reveals more about Allen than about the area she toured, alone, in 1987 when she was 41. It prepared me for rain, mud, and all the insects in the world. And so much of it, to Allen, was dirty, and poverty-laden, and slovenly. She kept trying to find meaning in everything, searching for something she obviously needed. She is always fearful, feels alienated, and men seem to scare her, though she seems to fall for almost every one she meets, especially her guides. Maybe being alone makes a difference. She had no group support to fall back on. This book has very little of beauty, or wonder, or just plain fun. It is haunting, but in a thoroughly depressing way."
4,"Part How-To, Part History","A fun book to read and study, it reminds us (woodworkers) that having the proper power tool isn't necessarily needed for achieving the end goal of finishing a project. The book is not so much a How-to but a How-was, informing the reader that although 200 years ago our forefathers didn't have a 3 HP table router or a 12 inch Jointer, they were able to produce furnishings that are still highly prized and beautiful today. Roy's conversationalist style of writing is often more like talking with a 200 year old carpenter and is as informative an enjoyable. Rather than giving specific plans with cutout diagrams and where to nail/screw the work he provides us with the inspiration and basic techniques for making our own unique pieces that will stand the test of time."
2,Hollywood showbiz,Don't be fooled by the featuring of Lotte Lenya great though her Pirate Jenny may be. This is a sanitised showbiz version of Brecht which fails entirely as satire or political comment.
5,classic hard to find performance...marvelous,"this is a hard to find performance, the original off broadway performance...but better yet would be the Papp Theater performance available from Sony reissued in 2009 of that performance at the Beaumont Center with Raoul Julia, that is even bettere and the orchestration is marvelous, the singing superb and the recording magnificent."
1,midnight ramble,Amazon.com:I never received this CD...sent e-mail on 10-29-08 to seller and no response....I want a refund...!!! Victor Chavez
3,This one is not the best book in the series.,"This is the last of the ""first generation"" of Robotech. Lots of main characters are killed off. The book ends on a grim note. Humans seem to have no hope. The next book begins the ""second generation"". This one is not the best book in the series."
3,Superceded,"This book has a lot of interesting background on the Lochner case, but it's based on a Ph.D. thesis written in the 1980s. Since then, the author's interpretation of Lochner, that it represents an attempt by the Supreme Court to impose Social Darwinism and laissez-faire, has been superceded by several much more subtle works, especially Howard Gillman's 1993 The Constitution BesiegedThe Constitution Besieged: The Rise & Demise of Lochner Era Police Powers Jurisprudenceand David Bernstein's more recent Rehabilitating LochnerRehabilitating Lochner: Defending Individual Rights against Progressive Reform, which can be seen as a direct response to, and demolition of, Kens's book. This book needs some serious updating in light of the more recent scholarship, but it doesn't look like the author and his press are inclined to do so."
2,Not in OEM Packaging & 3 times the shipping,"I was a little disappointed in these because they were not in the oem packaging and only one had the protective coating on it. Were they used or returns, don't know. I understand costs for shipping but 3 times the cost for buying 3? How about a little bit of a break on shipping when you purchase more than one item."
5,Subtle Sun,"This record is perfect in a rather safe way that will keep it from ever being my favorite, but I do love basking in it. Kind of how I really prefer pre-storm tension and a fierce wind to 75 and clear skies, but if you can manage to really hate the latter, I'm not sure I want to know you. Actually the lyrics are rather dark sometimes, but goshdarnit, it's sunny darkness. The best kind. I'm gone now. ::basks::"
2,PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIKE CATS WERE MICE IN ANOTHER LIFE!!!,Let me just say REGARDLESS of what animals you have if any the vacuum is not very good. It lacks the suction and for the price it is frankly not worth it. I would not buy another Hoover unless you plan on spending more money.
4,After 4 years I did some maintenance,"Well... Here's an update.Replaced the agitator and belt.Easy.If you read my former big review I broke the top cord wrap.I ordered a new one. Much better design; only cost a few bucks.Snapped in place; newer ones shouldn't have this problem.2 new belts, 1 agitator, new cord wrap hook, delivered(1 day) 28 bucks.We have burber(sp?) carpet so it knocked out a lot of the bristles and I replaced the belt cause I was there. (lost the extra one that came with vac.)Cleaned out the agitator area LOTS OF DIRT!!!I still think for those of us with less than 5 cats this vacuum works great. I'm really amazed by those who complain it doesn't work or lacks suction. Like I said in my original review for me suction is the smallest issue of all!!!!I've had this vac at least 4 years and besides some minor annoyances it works fine, especially for the money."
2,Onboard stretch hose - JOKE,"This vacuum cleaner may be good price. It is loud. It vacuums fair to poor. The ""Onboard stretch hose"" is, at best, a joke. This ""Onboard stretch hose"" is a dumb idea and has no utility. It can barely reach the distance of the extenstions. Unfortantely, I bought it."
1,Hoover WidePath or WindTunnel,"What a piece of S**T... Hoover used to a top of the line brand in cleaners, at least I used to think so until I purchased two of their WidePath. Problem is it goes through belts at about every third cleaning. The ""agitator"" belt runs directly off the motor with no cooling measures. I run the head as high as possible trying to relieve some of the friction stress on the belt but it has little effect. It has to be design because both cleaners are doing the same thing. I'll be buying a new cleaner in the future and it WON'T be a Hoover!"
2,Not Impressed,"I have owned this vacuum for just over two years. I have never been very impressed with its cleaning power. The suction is poor and I'm forced to go over the same piece of carpet repeatedly. With four cats and a 7-year-old boy, I need something that will actually suck!The final straw was when the motor blew 3 months after my warranty expired. I would NEVER purchase this vacuum again."
5,king kong/ son of kong./might joe young set,very nice gift set ! came timely and in great shape. movies were very good and met my expectations. the discs were perfectly filmed and modernized.
5,Only one disappointment...,"What can I say about King Kong? I've seen it over 300 times, and I've been waiting for the DVD since the day I bought the first of my 1,200-title collection. Loved the MCCooper documentary. The other 7-part documentary, however...an hour about Kong and an hour of Peter Jackson spouting? Sheesh. It's a sad commentary that this ALL-TIME CLASSIC was released only because some upstart filmed a remake. All that was missing was an interview with Dino DeLaurentiis and Jessica Lange..."
5,Kong alive and well,It's amazing how well this film has held up for over 70 years. The special effects although not as flashy as todays were very good. Just the right mix of horror and humor. Film makers today should watch and learn. Same kudos for Mr. Joseph Young.
3,doesn't know University of Chicago,"I got this as my first Sheila Travis mystery because it was set in Chicago. That obviously was a mistake, as Ms Sprinkle has slight knowledge of the city or of the Hyde Park/University of Chicago area or terminology. For example University people wouldn't meet where Sheila was asked to meet, but at the Point or further north. And UC is on a term system & the fall term ends by the middle of December, so few students would be around campus the Friday before Christmas.In any setting, I can't imagine how an institute's president could be so ineffective & keep his job for so many years."
3,Sheila Travis in Chicago,"I recently discovered Patricia Sprinkle and have read many of her books, including the entire Sheila Travis series. Unfortunately, this was not one of my favorites. While Sprinkle's plot lines were impeccable, and it did make for a great mystery, the description of the setting - Chicago - was not as vivid as her descriptions of Atlanta and Charleston, where other books are set. Clearly, Sprinkle is more comfortable and familiar with those settings. This is still a great read, especially if you have read other Sheila Travis titles."
1,"WARNING, I give this 0 stars if I could","This is NOT the real singers, they are a bunch of studio sigers. If it was the real singers the songs are totally unrepresentitive of 90's music. BAD BAD BAD."
4,Great product!,"Always in stock in my garage! A must for engine, door jams and other hard to reach places. Has the cutting power of a major degreaser without harming your paint finish."
5,A True Television Classic!!!,"One of the quintessential television comedies of the 1970's. While it is difficult to summarize 7 seasons of outstanding acting, directing and writing in only 7 video cassettes (two episodes per tape), this collection does a rather good job of highlighting each seasons' best. Wish they could have expanded the collection to include more classic episodes... ""Ted's Wedding;"" ""The Good Time News;"" ""Mary's Delinquent;"" ""SueAnn's Sister."" Maybe we can look forward to another Best of the MTM Show Collection, Volume II. Kudos all around!"

2,Not very helpful,"This book is not a bad place to start, but it's not very helpful either. It does not list all preschools in San Francisco. The information about schools seems to come from the schools (schools provide mission statement, for example) and is not consistent or particularly informative. The guide does not give an insider view of preschools, nor does it indicate which schools are particularly hard to get into. I liked that lists schools by zip code, but it doesn't provide a map to show where the schools are, which would be more helpful."
2,"Fairly generic, publicly available information.","This book didn't give me anything I couldn't have found without looking in the yellow pages or online. It is a comprehensive list of SF pre-schools with contact info and description, but not much else. I would have liked to have known which schools have waiting lists, what their entry criteria are, etc. It would also be nice to get a feel for relative school popularity."
4,Great book to help parents with select preschool,"""You've got to start early with your child's preschool registration, especially with the baby boom."" I had heard this a lot, but did not know where to start until I found this book. It lead me all the way from interview with school to pre-registration."
5,Ravel of great delicacy,"Ravel's solo piano works contain some remarkably beautiful music. Paul Crossley's survey is surely one of the finest. His ""Gaspard"" certainly produces plenty of atmosphere, and the shorter pieces at the end of the disc are very finely executed. For me, though, the highlight is his "" Le Tombeau de Couperin"", which is played with such delicacy. Crossley's approach is beautifully crystalline, and he brings out all the subtlety of Ravel's harmonies with unerring skill. Indeed, his lightness of touch throughout the whole programme is most telling, making the music sound as evocative as you could hope. Very highly recommended."
4,Full-color workbook-style history for 3rd or 4th grade Catholic student.,This is a primary Catholic-American History book which may supplement a broader curriculum. It's a book of stories which are written at a third grade level with a set of short answer questions at the end of each story.Two of the stars are because the artwork is wonderful - an affordable teaching source for art history for those who want books to do double duty.
3,Cerberus,"Plot: Steal the sword of Attilla the Hun...unleash a 3-headed dog(made of BAD CGI) to wreak havoc amongst a village in the hills of BFE...bring in good guy and good girl to save the day...OK, my take on this...not really a BAD movie...typical plot line...BAD CGI...definitely not worth the $24 to spend on it...I can think of a LOT of other things to spend $24 bucks on...good for maybe 1/2 price rental...but I actually did like it...would have been better if it had GOOD CGI...goes down as a ""good"" movie after drinking a few beers late at night"
3,"Well, they tried","The scifi channel (as usual) manages to try and create a could-be-awesome movie and fails to deliver. They kinda sorta stuck true to the legend and all but everything is ruined by bad CGI, I recommend this movie only to scifi channel movie fans. Its hard rating this one, it'd be more like a 5/10."
2,"It's bad ,trust me on that.",Steal a sword and unleach the devil ...there is a three headed dog and special effects straight out of sci-fi tv. The acting is not quite as good as a grade 4 drama class and basically we've all seen this type of film before.Is it watchable ?? Yes but only if you're watching Television for the first time.Please oh please dont see this...certainly your 1hr 32 mins can be better spent.I'm the first to review this and certainly I hope to be the last to do so.
5,Another great read!!!!!!!!!,"Luke Walker is the brother of Matt from ""Men of courage"". Luke has said some unkind things about a clinic that treats patients using natural treatments instead of drugs. Luke has to work at the clinic for 3 months as a punishment. Sparks certainly fly between Luke & Faith & both of them realise they both have things to offer their patients.But can they offer the one thing they each need from the other..."
2,From Back Cover,"E.R. head Dr. Luke Walker saves all of his bedside manner for his patients. With the hospital staff he's outspoken, tough, no-nonsense... until now. Disciplinary action from the hospital board has landed him a three-month stint at the Healing Waters Clinic. And working around aromatherapy, accupuncture and yoga seems to be having a remarkable effect on him. But not nearly the effect Faith McDowell - the fiery redheaded director of the clinic - is having on his libido!The truth is Luke and Faith clash over everything - excpet their passion for healing people... and their passion for each other. Making love to Faith has a remarkable healing effect on Luke, puttin a sexy smile on his face. Problem is, Luke Walker, who has done his best not to need anyone, finds himself needing her. So now he has to use his most persuasive bedside manner to convince Faith that this passion is for keeps.[3rd in the American Heroes series; follow-up to Men of Courage.]"
3,it was okay,This book started out slow paced and didn't pick up speed. It was an okay book but it was quite boring and slow paced and that's all I have to say.
1,awful,"how to say it without using bad words ....... very disappointing.a) the book is so cheaply constructed, several pages simply fell out when I first opened it, they had not been bound (they were NOT errata or an addendum).b) many, many pages are simply repeated, I assume to get the page count up. ""famous people from the bronx"" was repeated a couple of dozen times.really bad."
5,Photos and Stories of my Memories,"I found this group of stories compiled into one book form was truly wonderful. So many of the photos were of another era. It's amazing that they ever surfaced and can be found in this book. The stories, some made me laugh, some made me cry, but all were delightful. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Interesting stuff, but crude binding","The ""book"" is very interesting and has a lot of great pictures, stories, and classifieds... But.... It really wasn't bound properly... Pages keep falling out of the binding and you feel like you have to be careful turning pages or the whole thing will fall apart...Wouldve been 5 stars if it was properly bound.. And based on another review here, it seems that my copy wasnt the only one that had this problem."
5,Authentic Hallmark ornament,this ornament came in the original hallmark box unopened and in excellent shape there was no defects to the product and the colors for the team were dead on
5,Well worth the money.,"BUILD BOOK: From Concept to Reality, is an amazing book. Most of the photos were taken by Scott Killeen, whose used to shoot for Super Rod, Hot Rod, Motor Trend, and Street Rodder magazines. The book covers Troy Trepanier's build up of a 1970 Cuda that belongs to Joe Rogan from Fear Factor.BUILD BOOK features over 800 color photos in 180 pages along with tips and tricks that Troy used to build the car. Even if you're not a Mopar guy, the book is good for reference for any build. I liked the quick read setup, and the photos are really detailed. I saw the Cuda at a car show this year, and it was awesome! It was also on the Rides television program. I saw Scott at a car show, and he said there's another BUILD BOOK due in December on a car called Aeroliner that Posies is building. This is well worth the price; I can't wait till the next one is available."
1,Badly done,"No chapters. You cannot go in and find what you might want to watch. . You have to watch the whole thing again. It is so badly done, you cannot even fast forward. Worst dvd i have ever bought. And, she doesn't explain the products by brand sothat you can find what you need. Terrible disappointment."
4,Good Vacuum,"Powerful suction and complete accessories. The only drawback is it is too noisy...But for this price, it is a good vacuum..."
2,OK but liitle detail,"This map has the major roads but there are no blow up maps for cities and we encountered some errors. It was somewhat helpful, but in many cities the highways through the cities are not clearly marked and it would be very useful to have more details for at least the larger cities."
5,We drove over 2200 kilometers with this as our guide!,We read that there aren't road maps at the airports or gas stations in the Yucatan so we took this map with us. Are we glad we did! We found it to be quite accurate and easy to read. The local road signs gave us fits but with this map we were always able to figure out what we had done wrong...where we were...and how to get back on track. Very durable construction!
5,Wonderful Product,Great transaction. Shipped in plenty of time for my trip. Would have been lost without it!
4,Enjoyable Book for the Price!,"Basically I bought this book just to have access to a couple of illustrations in it. However, as it was in hand, I ended up flipping through it more than expected. I usually view these books as knock offs for general consumption at the discount book stores, but I think this one surpassed that level, at least at the price it can be purchased for. Great illustrations peppered with diagrams and photographs. The chapters were short, which is about all I wanted them to be on some of the battles chosen. I found interest in battles/wars that I never thought I would have. The biggest challenge the author had was in which battles to chose. Personally I would have picked a number of different ones, but never-the-less, for the price, it is worth some causal reading."
2,Looks good on the coffee table,"I agree with a few earlier reviewers that this is an attractive book with opaque explanations and confusing illustrations. For me, it brought to mind Stephen Hawkin's ""Universe in a Nutshell"", a fascinating book of impenetrable text, beautifully illustrated with incomprehensible drawings.Probably experienced cabinetmakers would read this book and nod their heads that old Andy knew what he was talking about. But I'm NOT experienced and I could not find (or maybe, understand) the answer to any questions I've had about projects I have in preliminary stages. In my quest to develop a new hobby to go with my new retirement, I have found ""The Complete Manual of Woodworking"" by Jackson, Day and Jennings to be way more helpful - much more clearly written with illustrations that are much easier for me to figure out."
5,Excellent reference,"As the author states, this is a book designed to be used. Its not a book of projects, but it will make building your projects easier. There are very detailed pictures accompanying each chapter, along with descriptive text that's easy to understand and follow. Each aspect of furniture and cabinet construction is covered in depth, with multiple options given equal treatment. Attaching doors, building drawers, attaching legs and feet and on and on.Overall, an excellent book and one I reference frequently."
2,Not a how to book,"Had some ok spatterings of information , but overall I found it a bit dissapointing. Its a fairly big book but doesnt seem to really show anthing ground breaking. If I had seen it before hand I wouldn't buy it again. Thats not to say in the right hands this book wouldn't be handy .Has some interesting info on how to make your own hinges, apart from that the rest is pretty standard stuff."
1,Very basic level book,I am reluctant to put much effort into writing a review about a entry level text. The information contained within is generic and simplistic. If you can distinguish between a hammer and a nail this book is not for you. I'm going to give mine to my 10 year old neighbor.
3,Too General,"I found this book to be too general and as a result not necessarily useful to me. I am a beginner and for me this book provided a very high level overview of construction techniques with rarely enough detail about each to actually apply them. In order to actually build something I would need additional books that provide the hands on detailed explanations, tips, best practices etc. that would help me to achieve good results. The author seemed to assume that the reader has a basic knowledge of woodworking already. However, I can't help but think that if I were an intermediate level woodworker that already had some experience with the techniques highlighted here then most of the content of this book would be obvious. As a result I basically don't understand who this book is for."
3,A little too general,"Given the scope of this work, I'm not sure what I expected, but I feel like, after reading a book on furniture and cabinet making, I ought to have some idea of how to construct a basic cabinet. While this book covers a wide variety of general techniques and types of joints commonly used, at no point does it tie them together; it discusses possibilities, but never synthesizes them into anything tangible, leaving me, at least, wondering which of the book's assorted grab bag of clever tricks might be combined to actually produce a cabinet. I already knew what a sliding dovetail was before I bought this book; what I sought to learn was the architecture and structural elements needed to design a cabinet. Strangely, I feel like I'm no closer to that knowledge than I was before I read the book."
5,Very usable,This book is very well organized and has many excellent examples of cabinet construction. He goes into great detail on all types including frameless cabinets.I have been looking for something which would give me the basics as well as provide for more advanced concepts. I am very pleased to have found such a thing in one volume.I highly recommend this book.
3,A good book that should have been great,Elusive prose. Lacks definition of new terms. Mediocre photography. Needs more closeup photos. Better choices of background images would have helped mostly washed out color photos.Book is a disapointment considering that it comes from Taunton Press.
2,Just pictures,"I bought this book after only browsing it in a local library. I was impressed with all the pictures on it. When I bought my copy, I realized it is nothing close the title of the book. It does not follow a complete project at all. Basically, it is an overview of all the parts involved in making furniture and cabinets. It is more like 5,000 different mini topics jammed in one book. Each of this mini topics gets a half to a one page coverage. There a no plans or projects done in this book."
2,disappointed,I found this book very disappointing. The pictures were very pretty but that is pretty much it. The illustrations were confusing and of little use. It gives too much of an overview and no real specifics. I found woodworking for dummies to be a much better book for the beginning woodworker.
4,EXCELLENT PICTURES but missing some basics,Some of the terms are not explained so this is not for the beginer even though it seems to be written for one. I guess they assume any person that enjoys wood and want to know more already knows some of the terms given. oh kerf it all.
4,The Complete Illustrated Guide to Furniture and Cabinet Construction by Andy Rae,"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Furniture and Cabinet Construction is a great library of information for planning, setup, ideas and just looking at furniture construction techniques you may want to learn. I am very happy to have this book and look at it regularly for ideas. More than a shop book. This book will present solutions you may need when building or designing your next projects. Tools needed for the furniture and cabinets are discussed with helpful layout and use of needed materials and accessories and jigs. I enjoy just thumbing through it in the evening. You would be wise to have this Taunton Press Publication."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know...and then some.,"I really like the approach taken by all of the books in this series -- contextual background, good mix of both illustrations and photographs, and helpful commentary on the techniques. This book is VERY comprehensive and likely has the answer to whatever question you may have, which leads to my one criticism: it goes overboard in a few places and overwhelms you with information that isn't necessarily critical to building a cabinet."
3,"Looked ok, didn't fit my silverado that well though","I had Weathertech mats in my Infiniti FX35, but when I bought an old truck I thought I would save some money as these are about 1/3 cheaper. I was not impressed with the fit though, and they aren't as rigid as the weathertech mats either. The look was ok, but for the price I wasn't pleased. Amazon took them right back so no problem there though. I went with a set of 30 dollar mats from my local auto parts store and although they don't give the complete coverage, they don't get in the way and are a little thicker and certainly cheaper. So I would suggest either going with exact fit mats, or something cheaper and which you can see in person."
4,Good series--good solid mysteries,"I liked the first book and the third book in the series best - but this one is very good. The main character, Annie, rather than picking up where she left off in book one--moves dramatically ahead emotionally. Most of the favorite characters come back--Madame Mina especially and in this book, I got more attached to her. Instead of mother-in-law, this character is more developed and is truly enjoyable all by herself. The gypsy factor (Madame Mina) makes this book unique, gives it a quirk here and there and ads dimension. Worth a read."
4,Brain Candy,"This is a cute book that can be read in on sitting. I call books like this brian candy, you can read them in one sitting and they make you feel high like a suger rush. The woman in question wants a baby very much. To the point she is going to get a sperm doanner. Enter our hero, her best friend he hates the idea of doing this. Passion errupts and need less to say the baby is concieved the old fashioned way. A delightful book well written modern and very funny in places. A book for a day at the beach."
1,Warning,"Note that the artists of this is the Countdown Singers, and not the original artists. Just something to consider before you fork over 5 bucks."
1,Simply a waste!,"Ok, I wanted to get this album since I absolutely love 80's music! And since this was on sale, I jumped to get it! UNFORTUNATELY, there's a problem with it... NONE OF THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS ARE PLAYING THE SONGS! On the bottom of the album it says simply ""The Countdown Singers"". And plus, these remakes are in no way better than the originals, take ""Bad"" by legend Michael Jackson. ""The Countdown Singers"" have it all wrong.My suggestion? Don't waste your money on this, get an album with the original people doing their own music. True fans of such classics like ""Every Breath You Take"" or ""Addicted to Love"" would probably not appreciate the lower quality of these remakes."
2,"""The 80's was really like this?""","This 80's chartbusters exibit many great qualites, and also not so great qualities. Some 80's chartbusting hits were not added to this CD,some songs like "" Billie Jean"" and ""Wake me up before you Go Go"" highlight some of the best 80's pop that there was, however famous bubble gum pop that shouldve been added was not. Hearing the Go-Go's, Tiffany, or Wang Chung wouldve highlighted this CD greatly. I would recommend this CD to the not so avid 80's listener. Or is it maybe I havent caught up with the new Millenium?"
2,Don't waste the money!,"It just is not well constructed and so although it is a great design and idea, it won't last for long no matter how little you use it. My vent clip came apart a little over two months into using it, and the clear plastic cord holder on the side broke off within a week. Spend your money instead on a different car mount cell holder that fits a variety of phones and Ipods- one that is better quality and has adjustable arms. My boyfriend likes theHeavy-Duty Universal Car Mount Holder for Cellphone, MP3 Player, iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry, Droid, GPS Garmin, TomTom, Magellanso I think I'll try this one next as it also has a car vent clip besides the window suction arm. Hope this was helpful!"
1,CAUTION!!!,"This will not hold an IPOD!!!The IPOD mini ceased to be produced in September 2005!Although it clearly says IPOD ""mini"", the picture leads you to believe that a current IPOD would fit.Why would they include a picture of the IPOD mini when they have not been produced for SIX years?I think you know why!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"Product seem to be good, however my phone did not fit in it. I have a Tmobile Dash (HTC S670)and it is way too big"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this item to clip on my car's air vent.Well, my Treo fell off in less than 1 hour.I didn't think it was going to feel this cheap.Also, my treo didn't fit into the holder either. I had to push it in.I wouldn't recommend this product unless you have a flip phone."
4,It works but hard to remove it from the vent,"It works by holding the phone in place. However, when I tried to remove the holder from the vent, it took some effort to do it trying not to damage the vent in my car."
4,"High quality, easy to use, with handy remote.","Mine doesn't like Memorex CD-R audio disks, yielding a 50% OPRFAIL result, but so far 100% success with other brands tried. Very easy to use. Looks nice, yields superb quality digital audio disks. Wonderful for archiving ""lost"" oldies that can still be found around on tape in your closet somewhere. Would prefer the display numbers were a little clearer, since a ""7"" is hard to distinguish from a ""1"", but this is a small concern. Instantly see how much time is recorded or how much remains available. For manual track incrementation (where no clean, three-second pause exists between songs), has excellent pause feature and automatically increments track when resumed, with the remote providing a very handy and reliable means of doing this. Couldn't be easier to use, and the quality is superior."
4,Needs CD Digital Audio CD's,"Handsome unit, well made and laid out. However, just so that you dont make the same mistake we did, it does require Digital Audio CD's and not the standard Recordables you can get for allot less money. I did not know this at the time I purchased it. I admit to not reading allot about electronics but I would consider myself at least an average consumer. You need Digital Audio CD's and, if you want to record from another CD Player digitally, be sure that player has digital output. If it has only Optical digital output, you then need a fiber optic chord which is rather expensive and does NOT come with this unit. So be aware of what else you will need before buying. Otherwise, a nice unit."
1,Hate it.,"We have had this phone for a year and will be replacing it asap. The voice quality during phone calls is good, but the voice quality of messages is poor. Sometimes we can't even understand what the speaker is saying. I've called home and heard our greeting on this machine and it is also poor voice quality. We find it inconvenient that the message-waiting signal cannot be seen from across the room. We have to walk over to the phone to see if there are messages. Also, very annoying is that every time the phone plug has become loose or electricity has been otherwise interrupted we have to reset the clock or we'll get nothing but error messages!"
2,2 STARS BECAUSE IT STILL WORKS A LITTLE,i have had this phone since march 2004. the answer machine cuts off before the people can leave a phone # and short message and when i have an apartment for rent and pay about $135.00 for the ad in the newspaper and get home to 25 or so messages. most of the phone #s are cut off because the people leave their phone # last after their short message. Also i just bought a new battery at thanksgiving and it is almost dead now and the phone is not used that much for talking.GE GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND PUT SOME QUALITY BACK IN YOUR PRODUCTS
2,The phone I got had an echo,"I got this phone and returned it the next day. It had a very annoying echo when you spoke. I dont know if I got a defective unit or if it's a design flaw because I opted to get another phone instead.Note that I have a wireless network in my apartment, so who knows if that had any effect one the phone; however I have another 2.4ghz Panasonic that works just fine."
5,Not bad for the price,We replaced a 2.4 ghz uniden when we installed a wireless network because of static and noise on the line....The Ge phone works great no problems so far. very clear reception...
5,Good place to get used books with fast service,I am very pleased with the book I received in a professional manner. I will buy from this seller again for my library needs.
5,Understanding the Middle East Conflicts,"This book thoroughly covers the basics of the history of the Middle East while giving a better understanding to the reader of the complexities of the reasoning of each side.Mr. Campbell begins with a historical balanced perspective of each of the religions of Abraham: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He follows with details of the conflicts among these three religions.The final chapters examine the current situation in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, and make specific recommendations how the US can best resolve the dilemma of our involvement. Suggestions for decreasing the US dependency on Middle East oil, reducing our military requirements and political solutions for the Israel - Palestine conflict are outlined for consideration.I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to gain a more thorough understanding of the history and conflicts of the region.."
3,Not for Vista,"Very real, very good directions and support. Plan on spending a lot of time reading and studying directions and tactics. Just like being there. But it will not play correctly on Windows Vista, even set to XP compatability."
2,Too Many BUGS!!!,"This sim. has too many buggs to work well. I had to load thee new drivers for my graphics card befor it would run at all and it runs like pooh! I have all the problems that other reviewers had. I also don't get the campaigns, i have flown on all three forces and it is much easyer to win the warif you fly for Germany. Iam very dissaponted in this game CFS1&CFS2 are much better . Don't buy this game!"
1,Combat Flight Simulator,"I have read reviews that state the you need a top end machine to play this game, that is not true, I have a top end machine and this game still does not play. This game is not worth the box it comes in. If you like combat fight sims, get the older CFS2, or CFS1."
1,Not good enough,"Taken back to the store. I've been a player of WWII Aerial sims since the good ol' days of European Air War.CFS1 was medium, it's flight model lacking in several aereas, and this isn't that much of an improvement.If you want a WWII thrilling feeling, be it ground, air or sea, check out wwiionline.com in stead. /Much/ more fun, not to mention realistic.Cheers"
1,I should have read the reviews...,"I wish I would have read the reviews here before I went to get the game. I have Combat Flight Simulators 1 and 2 and enjoyed them immensely, so I figured I would pick this one up. Especially after looking at the minimum requirements. I have a pretty fast machine (1.6 GHZ P4, GeForce3 with 64M, 256M memory) so I figured it should be no problem, right? Wrong. The game was so choppy that it is almost unplayable and I had the sliders set to the middle.Anyways, I would not recommend that anyone buys this game. In fact, I'm going to be hard pressed to get another game of Microsoft. It seemed like that was the one division they actually cared about, now apparently they don't."
1,Rushed for Christmas Delivery?,"I think the marketing folks at Microsoft rushed this one to market before it was ready. Like the others who rated it I too had it bring my fairly new computer to it's knees. It has less combat missions than any previous version (CFS1,CFS2). For the money, CFS1 is still the best. The great graphics came with CFS 2 along with less missions and bugs. This release is just too resource intensive and does not have enough missions to keep it interesting. I brought mine back to Costco for a refund after 2 days. Microsoft, next time take your time and do it right!"
1,Save Your Money,"Do not buy this game. The graphics are semi good. You have to press the number pad 2 key to view the instruments, and then they are too dim to read, not to mention being out of focus. The sky is so dark you can't see the other airplanes. The gun sights are off target. As you play, the program jerks and skips and eventually locks-up your computer. The only thing that will restart it is the main power switch. If you want a good program, get Combat Flight Simulator 2 WWII Pacific Theater."
1,major disappointment,"CFS3 strikes out on all the requirements of a combat flight sim.The terrain graphics, touted as new and better, are muddy and look artificial. The aircraft graphics are no advance.The game play is poor--no advance over cfs2 in any paramater.The flight modeling is arcade-like--no real feel of flying, and all planes feel pretty much the same.The 'virtual cockpit' is a step back with poorly detailed instrument panels.The 'stutters'--widely complained about--are the final straw.Even on a high end system, the graphics stop, jerk, start again for no apparent reason, far too often.MS would have been far better to continue to evolve the CFS2 model than to go with this--it's certainly not better in any respect.Overall, I'd give it a 0 if I could, based on it falling so far below what was the state of the art in flight sims even 2-3 years ago."
1,Save your bucks,"Having been a big fan of CFS2, I was excited about buying this new simulator. I like to think that I have a pretty good system, graphics package, etc. But this thing is so buggy it causes my computer to crash everytime I try to play it. What a major disappointment. I know people who have had success with it.........but several more that have had the same problem as I have. Save your money!"
1,"Microsoft Flight Sim 3, the Battle for my Dollar: LOST","This is my first Combat Flight simulator. I wish I could take it back. I have M.S. Flight Sim 2000 pro, and love it. This sim 3, Battle for Europe, bombs. Or I guess, I should say doesn't when it should. Anyway, nothing but aggravation. Most of the keyboard commands don't work. How to text is sketchy, at best. The training movies not only didn't run, but locked up the computer. The booklet implies that once you load the software it is just a matter of double clicking the icon on your desk top to run it. Not so. I have to load to ""the proper disk"" each time I try to play. It is definitely not worth the trouble or the money I spent on it."
1,1 Star isn't low enough,"After purchasing a new P4 1.8 processor with 510mb of ram and a 64mb 3-D controller I discovered that Microsoft does not support the driver or controller.Microsoft tech support went on to say that they don't support ANY Intel Graphics cards, and that they know that they don't list this on the product requirements...."
1,A total waste of $ & time.,"Short and to the point... This program [is bad]! I'm a veteran simmer and I own a 2.53GHz P4 with 768MB RAM and a 64 MB NVIDIA GEFORCE4 MX-420 Video card. You would think that you could run just about anything with a system like this right? Wrong! After rolling back my NVIDIA drivers and making numerous changes in the included configuration utility (which I might add you probably need a software engineering degree to fully understand) I managed to get the game to run so that it only stutters a little with the clouds (the best looking part of the game) turned down to 1 and the rest of the sliders at 4. The result is a game that neither looks as good as the two previous versions nor plays as well and worse yet, since this is a major departure in format from the first two games, none of the aircraft or scenery are compatible."
3,MS combat flight Sim 3..WORTH IT????,"I run a p4 2.4 with geforce 4ti 4600 and 512 mb ram. I thought it would easily run cfs 3 but boy o boy, it has a lot of chop. Have played it with the graphics tuned down and if you have to run it this low you may as well stick to European air war. With everything turned up to max the game is real pretty but the frame rate drops so much that targeting is hard on occasions. The game is not smooth at all. It would be a great game if it was smooth...Microsoft..you need to help out the dedicated sim fans out there...and fast"
1,unable to review,"I cannotrun this game on my windows 7 computer. I loads ok, but when you try to run it the piture on the screen jerks and fades in and out(blank monior screen). the selection options never appear at all. other times it has case the system to crash with an error message saying the system has been shut down for itsown protection. is there a solution. HEIP."
1,"Great game, If you love to fly as I do.","This game is for a person as I who enjoys to fly planes. The person I ordered it from was verygood with service,as to, shipping & quality of game."
1,Stiffed,"Don't buy it.We own a new Sony VAIO with a 2 Gig processor and 500 Gig hard drive, and the game won't run. Tried all the MS online fixes and recommendations...and the opening video plays...and the screen locks. I also own FS 2000 and Combat FS on this machine...which both work fine. The MS online help is available for a price that equals the cost of the game. Look, I'm probably commiting Operator Error and I'm not aware of the fix. So be it. After two days of this nonsense, this game has exceeded my interest level"
1,Tragic Results,"Having purchased Flight Simulator 2002 , and using the marvelous Corsair a lot, I certainly looked forward to getting my hands on CFS3. To say I was disapointed is an understatement. I paid good cash for this, though mail order . Which means it cant be taken back to the store for a refund. When it arrived I hot footed up to install. Initialy with all the slow graphics and strange flight effects, I thought I'd installed it incorrectly. After 3 re-loads I came top the conclusion that its the game...and not my PC, which is only 5 months old . Of course it could be the XP. Pity the great graphics and smooth movements on FS2002 has not been carried over to CFS3. Tragic ..and a waste of money. Avoid it if you can..."
1,Save your money,The promise is great but I can't even get the thing to run. I have a brand new HP computer and it tells me my graphics hardware is not up to par. This has been the most difficult program to install/run I have ever encountered. I've had every prior version of FS/CFS to date. MS needs to fix it. Very Disappointed.UPDATE: It won't run because MS does not support Intel graphics. How much more mainstream can you get than Intel!? And MS doesn't support it!?! I hope a fix is coming for this soon.
4,Great Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered this game a couple days ago and am HAVING TONS OF FUN. I have a PC with 512 RAM and a 96 Mg Intergrated graphics card with a 2.5 Ghz Processor and it runs perfect with the sliders at 4. Great game for anyone who loves WW2 and dogfighting.A+++++++++++++++++
1,worst in CFS series,"I've been looking forward to get into the CFS3 cockpit after experience with previous CFS & CFS2 titles, as well as long time fan of MSFS series.... after MSFS2002 I've been expecting a lot; wrong. Badly disappointed, won't repeat what other reviewers already mentioned; the game is just plain bad.Don't buy it; get Il-2 Sturmovik for a decent WW2 air combat instead, or even old WW2 Fighter from Janes will give you more fun."
2,Disappointing,"Time will tell if outside developers can fix this mess. Only buy it if your looking for something along the lines of Crimson Skies. For WWII flight simulator buffs I'd suggest sticking with CFS1 and 2 as modified by the wealth of available add-ons, or IL2 Sturmovik, which is head and shoulders above the rest. Don't bother buying a MS FFB stick either, as it is NOT compatible with this game, even though the documentation states it is."
3,cfs3,"well I must say I expected more coming from the teams that gave us fs2002.Itis no were near as smooth and unless you have a super comp or play on all the lowest settings then it will glitch which proves very annoying im running 500mb ram and 64mb nvidia g4 and it still glitches and to be honest it aint that challenging ive retaken most of europe in 4 days on the hardest realism. The multiplayer is hard to get going and you need the disc in to play. All in all a bit dissapointing, shame because i thought it would at least compare to fs2002 on a good note the clouds are pretty good."
1,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"In Summary: buggy, slow, system hog, no real sense of speed or excitement, planes' appearance and flight model not very good, no compatability with CFS2 or FS2002. Product seems unfinished.Definietely don't buy it unless a patch becomes available to remedy most of the deficiencies."
1,This is a horrid game,"I have always been a fan of the microsoft flighsim series but this CFS3 really puts an end to it. The graphics are great and the planes and everything is really good but the campaign missions are all the same. Dont buy this game. CFS1 was the best...Nice and simple, non of this other lead your campaign poop."
2,"Combat Flight What??? No, not a simulator","First, this game has great graphics, although, way to demanding on the video card. I have a high end PC (AthlonXP 1.8ghz, 512MB DDR Ram, GeForce3Ti500 64MB DDR) and i could't get the graphics to run smoothly on anything above the average setting.The flight models really, in my opinion, [stink]. A great game, but definately not a sim. Got to make you wonder why FS2002Pro was [$$] and this is only [$$]. I guess price says alot. IL-2 is [$$] in stores, and is alot better.Overall, microsoft flopped."
2,A Suprising Disapointment,"I was suprised by this game, as a fan of Combat Simulator 1 & 2, I thought this game would be an evolution of those great games. Unfortunatly, this title leaves little to be desired. I must set the graphics setting to the lowest to keep the game at a decent frame rate. This game could have been great if Microsoft would have stuck with the same graphics engine as F2002. This game doesn't even feel like a Microsoft Combat Simulator. If you must have this game then save your money and buy this one used!"
1,Flight Simmer,"After CFS1 and CFS2, this is a real disappontment. There are many graphics card conflicts. It has the feel of an unfinished product. I have a P4 2.4Ghz computer with 1G RAM and an Nividia Ti4600 video card. Even with this setup the sim is slow.It is boring - you just don't get a sense of excitement, even in the thick of action.Take my advice and pass on this. Try IL-2, you'll be much happier."
3,Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3,"This software will usually result in ""Screen Lock"" and is unusable with Windows Vista. The problem occurs only occasionally with Windows XP. Disappointing in the limited selection of Bomber Aircraft included (no ""heavy"" B-17, B-24, Lancaster, etc). The flight character of various aircraft modeled do not represent those of the actual aircraft very accurately in terms of firepower, energy manueverability, and vulnerability (Typhoon particularly)."
1,Unbelievable,"It is truely amazing that a ""reputable"" company like MS would release something this bad. It's like they figured, ""what the heck, our customers will finish it for us."" The planes are NOT realistic, at all, the interface is silly, the scenarios are less than Jr. High quality, and it really boils down to you, after having paid how much?, have to squint and fiddle and make up excuses for this thing. Do not waste your money on this product. There are simply too many much, much better FS games out there. I could go into the particulars of exactly why this game isn't ANY fun whatsoever, but I don't think Amazon would appreciate a review that long. Believe me, this is one game that Microsfot should be paying YOU to play."
2,Good graphics but not much fun.,This game is o.k. they could have done a bit beter at the action and fun. The planes are pretty fun to fly. To aim at other planes you have to have very good hand eye cordination. It is the type of game you may play only once per month.
1,This is a piece of manure from Microsoft,"Short version: It. Does. Not. Run.Take your money and set fire to it, you'll save time trying to troubleshoot this piece of crud -- it just wasn't written very robustly. Or, if you'd rather, buy it and spend three hours downloading various patches and trying to tweak various settings on your machine trying to get it to function.The emperor wears no clothes. This is badly written software and it should not be purchased by anyone for any reason. Microsoft produces trash as far as I'm concerned and I'm angry with myself for not remembering that, I wanted to play this game, I wanted it to FUNCTION on a basic level AND IT DOES NOT DO SO. THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT FUNCTION. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
4,MS Flight Combat Flight Sim 3 is great!,"I recently purchased this flight sim (my first one) on the recommendation of a friend. It was easy to install. The updates were easily obtained and installed. It pretty much worked well right out of the box. I use a Logitech USB joystick. I learned the basics of flying and the commands to do so pretty quickly. We had to tweak our home routers a bit at first but after doing this, we have enjoyed playing MS Combat Flight sim over the internet together. Hours and Hours of great fun. I am going to purchase MSCFS 2 in the near future also."
1,Not as good as CFS2,"Microsoft really missed it with this one. I was excited about getting this after really enjoying CFS2. But this isn't that good. I have a fair system(P3@1Ghz, G4Ti500,512ddr,XpHome)and I have to run this game and the lowest graphic settings to play without my system locking up. Im also disappointed at the game sounds. They are the same ones from CFS2(ie:engine noise, guns firing). So if you really like CFS1 and 2 dont waste your money on this one."
1,Sim Junkie,"One star is generous. This sim, and I have them all, is a travesty to the genre. After 4 long days of tinkering with this sim I finally gave up and took it back. I so wanted this game to be a worthy successor to the CFS franchise but it would seem that they have taken a step backwards. With sim's like Il-2 Sturmovik out there Microsoft had there work cut out for them. Over at the message boards for the flight simulation community this ""game"" is taking quite a bit of heat. For the time being I would hold off on purchasing this title and wait and see if they develop a patch. Not Recommended!"
1,why no better?,"i can't believe that microsoft released this mess of a flight simulator. after sturmovik, i thought the bar had been raised high enough that microsoft would leap over it and show how to make a graphically beautiful, easy to use, and challenging combat flight simulator. but, no. this game looks like something from 5 years ago in terms of format. buggy, and with the screwiest warp feature i've ever seen. i'm sure a lot of work by good people went into this game, but the team directors didn't do their job. i hope some good mods come out of britain and russia to make this game enjoyable and useful."
1,Just Dull,"Setup was easy. Compatibility problem with my NVIDIA video card (which was fixed after a quick visit to the nvidia web site for an updated driver). Unlike some other reviewers, no problems with my MS Force Feedback joystick.Onto the game itself - the plus points of the game are those lovely clouds and err .... that's it. This game is simply boring. The long periods of inactivity followed by a brief dogfight / bombing mission probably reflect the reality of WW2. However, this is supposed to be a game and for those who enjoy shoot em ups, there is probably not enough action for you."
2,Fix the .exe file!,"I went around in circles for a few days trying to get this program to work, with no success. Then I went to http://gf.wiretarget.com/ and downloaded the fixed .exe file for this program. It now works as poorly (or as well) as Microsoft planned. They put so much security on the cd to make sure you can't copy it, the darn thing won't even work under optimum conditions. Luckily, the people at Wiretarget are able to come up with fixes for quite a number of games.This program now works, but I'm not sure it's worth the money. Very poor views when you're flying these aircraft."
2,"Accurate flight models, but less than stellar game play","CFS: 3 should be a sweet game for those who appreciate realism. On my 2.5 Ghz Pentium 4, w/ 64 MB NVIDA, the scenery is dead on, the flight models are accurate, and when enemy fighters come on, one gets the felling they are right in the middle of a WW II fur ball.That said, campaign mode totaly betrays the CFS: 3's virtues. You can't win. It's as if there is no correlation between what you do on the battlefield and the movement of the campaign. I've run missions where I destroyed not just my target, but several targets, and stayed in the air until all my AI wingmen have destroyed targets as well. No positive change in the battle whatever.Microsoft says on its CFS: 3 website that it has fixes planned in the future, so if you are willing to be a paying beta tester, there are many virtues to the game, but as a complete experience, this game needs improvement."
1,Huge computer power requirements,"This game is frustrating in part because of the grossly understated computer requirements. It takes a really powerfull system in order to see anything other than a jerky slide show. My middle class system--Pentium-4 at 1.3GHZ with accelerated GeForce-4 graphics card just will not cut it. I benchmarked my sys and it is performing OK and I have done EVERYTHING to make it run faster. Just when the intense action starts, the display gets jerky and your plane jerks from one attitide to another leaving you all out of sync. with the fight. The guns keep firing at nothing when it freezes. I had to turn off all the quality and detail controls just to get that! They should have been honest in stating the actual system needs. Don't but it unless you really have WAY more computer than I do."
1,TAKE NOTE BEFORE BUYING,"I bought the sim and it just wouldn't work. I have a good spec PC 2.5mhz P4 with Radeon 7500 card, 512 meg RAM etc and it didn't want to know. After messing about on Microsoft's knowldege base and going around in circles I decided enough was enough. I'm not prepared to risk updating my graphics drivers when this is the only sim of many that I have that doesn't work. (See also a customer review in Feb 2004 listing problems with graphic cards.) MICROSOFT, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! Luckily I bought from a source where I could return my sim for a refund, which I've done. CFS 2 will have to do!"
2,Limited LAN ability,Touts itself as a great LAN device yet customizing for multiplayer contest is extremely limited. Aircraft responses are more like flying a Bomber rather than a fighter in combat. For a Microsoft product one would expect a higher level of performance. If you're looking for a realistic flight simulator don't rely on this one.
1,Save your money ... buy IL-2,I should have believed the majority of reviews ... Microsoft should go back to the drawing table.
1,impossible game,"this game is horrible!!!the controls are near impossible!!! They are so touchy its impossible to keep the plane headed in a straight direction!!! And it has a really late reaction.i guess if you werea huge gamer and practiced for hours on end it would be great, but for the average gamer, do not even attemp this game."
2,Combat Flight Simulator 3,"After all of the hype that was going on about CFS 3 before it came out I was realy surprised and disapionted how it actually did turn out. One, it is a real frame sucker way worse than IL-2 Sturmovik. Two, the planes do look nice but some of the sounds are way off, some sound like lawnmowers like the Messerschmitt 109 and the Focke Wulf 190 :(. Three, it seems to have a dark look to it..almost kind of muddy. Four, the flight models are a joke, on the hardest settings you can still yank your stick way back and you dont have to worry about stalling...not to cool :(. This sim would be alright for people who want to learn how to fly and fight in a WWII aircraft in a few short hrs. But because of the bad flight models (way too eazy to fly) lame sound bad frame rates and dark look I cant give it a thumbs up. If you are a hardcore ""WWll Sim Fighter Pilot"" IL-2 Sturmovik is still the best thing out there for you, especialy for online play at ""Hyperlobby"". Salute :)"
2,Great Expectations; Poor Delivery,"If I had only played CSF1, I would have given this a higher review. But I have been playing IL-2 and now know that IL-2 is the superior combat flight simulator, bar none! CFS3 does have interresting ground vehicles to attack. Aircraft flight dynamics appear unrealistic, too simple. Scenery is FLAT, tree & object detail is very nice but where is all the raised mesh detail I would have expected? MicroSoft did ok, not good and definately not great. I'll give CFS3 2 stars and go back to playing UbiSoft's IL-2. ""C ya in the clouds"" Mtn."
3,"Good flight sim, but lacking dimension","This is a pretty good combat flight simulator, but it lacks the dimension of a really good campaign mode. There is no story to follow and the missions you accomplish don't really seem to have an affect on the movement of the battlefield front. If you are looking for hours of fun flying this is a good game for you, but not if you are looking for a campaign type game."
1,Low Grade Flight Sim,"I went out and spent 45 dollars on a flight sim I expected to be out of this world considering all the hoopla I saw on the net about it. Instead I got this...The same game Janes's came out with 4 years ago, with a different title, same graphics engine and everything. (Jane's WWII Fighters). Anyways, choppy gameplay..for some reason my 900mhz w/ 64mb video card isnt enough to go above graphics Lvl. 1, and i still have choppy gameplay. Why? Why does the creator of Flight Sim 2002 do this to their fair name? I went to great lengths to find a site I could say something about this horrible product on, but..obviously about 5 people already beat me to it."
2,Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3: Battle for Europe,"I expected much more from Microsoft on this flight Sim and they let me down. Oh well. I got started years ago with the Red Baron and really enjoyed it. I even bought the ""New"" Red Baron II later, but it was far too ""buggy"" and so I quite playing it.This effort at a flight Sim is a failed effort by the Microsoft programmers. BTW, I've had a private pilot's licence since 1971 and have flown tail draggers and am presently rated up to a dual engine 310. Still, I'd like to find a realistic WWII flight Sim that works. The FAA doesn't allow you to really blow people out of the sky."
2,Not particularly impressive,This is not a very good sim. If you want an outstanding combat flight simulator purchase IL2 Sturmovik 1946. I should have known better than buy this Microsoft turkey. I've been playing all the versions of IL2 since 2003 and it's still the best. IL2 + TrackIR + Saitek X52 joystick and throttle + Saitek rudder pedals = many hours entertainment.
3,Good sim,Graphics are a little outdated but still good and the play is very nice. I hope Microscoft will come out soon with CFS4 to go with FS4. I will buy it immediately.Buy it!
1,Don't believe the hype!,"This game was a waste of my money. I have CFS 1&2 and this version was a step backward. Frankly I was shocked that Microsoft would release such an inferior product. Save yourself some bucks and buy CFS1,it runs flawless and is very user friendly."
1,"Unless you've got a warp-speed computer, don't buy it...","My dear wife saw me looking at this game repeatedly (I'm a CFS1 and CFS2 player, avidly) in nearly every store we went to and out of her good heart got it for me for my birthday.I have a P800 with plenty of RAM and all my other simulators run just fine. When I first tried to run it, it said my video card wasn't supported and I needed to download other drivers. I did so and now the game ""runs""...barely. Even with graphics set at minimum detail it looks like a bad cartoon.I'll continue to play 1 & 2 but until you get the fastest computer ever built, don't get this..."
2,Nose dive,"I feel the same as many who have played CFS3, very dissappointed! For the amount I paid and the inability to return it, I feel as though I have been robbed. It does however have the potential to be really enjoyable if only MicroSoft would create a patch to clear up the vast amount of bugs in the program. If you are thinking of buying it wait for a patch to come out."
2,Graphical Problems just make it not worth while!,"I have a relatively strong system I would say(Athlon 2600, 512 pc3100, 100gig hard, geforce 4600) and I get nothing but stutters!!! I have tried many different configurations, even at low graphical detail, it doesn't stop stuttering! I went the websites that they say to go to for more help, I did what they said, including disabling a few things in the configuration program, and alas, nothing worked! I like the choices of planes, I love to fly sims, but I don't love this game. I would suggest not buying it, unless you can assure yourself a stutter free game. I know that I won't be reloading to my computer, darn waste of money!!!"
1,SHOULD I HAVE BOUGHT CFS3??,"As I am waiting for my shipment to arrive, since I purchased CFS3 via Ebay, I am now wondering if I made a terrible mistake in buying this sim so soon. After reading so many negative reviews, I feel that I may have done so. Yet, some of the reviewers did not mention the systems they were running to operate the sim, but I will see what happens when I load it on to my 1.47 Ghz, 20G hard drive, 64Mb Nvidia Gforce2, 1G Ram, system. I am also an avid flyer of Il-2 and will unlikely find any other sim out there that will touch the superior quality of Il-2. Maybe Microsoft should take some lessons,eh?"
1,Don't Buy cfs3 or you will wish you didn't.,"I have cfs1 & cfs2 already and my hopes were high that Microsoft would deliver in cfs3, the improvement they boasted of. But other than the nice clouds cfs3 is not nearly as nice as either cfs2 or even cfs1. The cities in cfs1 have better graphics. In multiplayer there is no lobby anymore, you can't land to repair your plane. The planes fly-ability have taken a step or two backwards. You can not open a second window like you could in cfs2 to watch your back. I am sad that Microsoft thinks so little of its loyal cfs gamers. The instrument panel is weak and the instruments look less real than in cf1 which did a pretty good job on their airspeed indicators, altimeters, compasses and so on.I hope they fix it fast."
4,Great overall game,this game is awesome i love the dogfights the bombing runs are excellent the realism on it is unnelievable. great game i recomend it to all.
1,I'd Give it 0 Stars if it weren't for multiplayer capability,"It does run fine on my P4 1.6GHz, 512mb SDRAM, GeForce4 4200Ti.However, the gameplay is aweful. You can't influence the campaign much at all even if you fly around for hours with unlimited ordinance. Seems oddly unrealistic that reincarnation seems to be normal among ships in a sector from mission to mission.Flight dynamics are OK. I'm an instrument-rated pilot and find it's close to what I'd expect in a video game.Multiplayer is the only thing worth playing and even that is full of bugs.(i.e. Aircraft crashed in water sit on top for a while and you are able to run into them).Documentation is terrible...especially regarding campaign gameplay. You have no idea what you must do in order to advance the campaign in your favor; if it's even possible to affect the campaign at all from the cockpit, and I have no evidence to suggest that it is.Spend your money on something else!!!"
1,cfs 3 a major disapointment,"this simulation seems like a throw back to a time when flight sims were in there infancy.lifeless cockpits,repetitive missions,not much fun at all.if microsoft is planing a cfs 4 i suggest they review il-2 sturmovik,this is the benchmark of combat flight sims.my advice is to save your money or buy il-2 instead."
5,The best simulator ever!!!!,"This is the second simulator that I have bought and out of the two, this one is the best!! It's like flying in real life!! It doesn't have any of the big bombers such as the B-17 or the B-24 or Lancasters but I love it anyway.If you are trying to decide between CFS3 and CFS2, get this one! However, if you want it to run well and without stopping often, you need to have a very high-speed computer or it will not be any fun at all. (Which is something that I had to learn the hard way.) I love to dogfight, it is one of the funnest things to do on the program.Alden savoca"
5,I disagree with most of the reviews!!!!,"I have to admit the game is hard. Most people are writeing stuff that isnt really true. The game has great grafics. The planes dont look like snap together models done by a four year old, compared to otherflight sims its a great game. Most of the reviewers that hate it probably are not good at it so they hate it. There are Gforces I like the game. If your good at flight sims you might like this game. Dont be fooled by the other reviews. Its a great game. Its worth the money."
2,Ten steps backwards,"I bought this on eBay for $[...] (shipping included) I thought I was getting a great deal. Bah! CFS2 is far superior. I cannot use the padlock view because it is so shabby. There's no online combat anymore,too. Microsoft shut down the servers! I'm barely able to gain altitude with full throttle while the AI pilots fly circles around me. I generally hate this game. I'll be leaving the disk on the book exchange shelf at work. What a waste."
5,One of the Two Best In The Later! series,"This, along with Later... with Jools Holland Legends, are the two best DVDs in the series by a LONG shot.Unless you are really into contemporary British bands, stick with these two.Highlights are Ray Davies ""You Really Got Me,"" Ronnie Wood ""Oh La La"" (now theme from TNT's ""Men of a Certain Age""), and Procol Harem's Gary Brooker doing a magestic ""A Whiter Shade of Pale.""Folks I had never heard of who did startlingly good appearances, Roisan Murphy (tall, thin and with a sexy and unique one-sided half dress that makes her charismatic performance evem ,pre enjoyable), Beverley Knight ""A Change is Gonna Come"" and Sam Brown (not a man) ""Drown in My Own Tears"" (British soul at it's best)_, David McAlmont ""Misty Blue"" (so charismatically and strikingly done that you will revisit it many times - WOW!) and Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews sultry duet on ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" which works all year 'round.Don't Miss it!"
5,Heidi,"This was one of my favorite books as a child--I don't think I've read it since then. I loved this 2011 edition translated anew. I didn't even remember how beautiful the story was seeing it afresh as an adult. This was also a favorite book of my mother and her 2 sisters when they were young. She encouraged me to read it like she always did, while eating Swiss Night cheese (those little foil-wapped triangles)--I used to climb into my backyard tree, eat my cheese, read Heidi and picture being in the beautiul Swiss alps! Thanks to Amazon.com and this perfect new copy of an old classic."
5,Es un cuento hermoso,Lo lei de pequeña y es una historia hemosísima... ahora de grande la estoy leyendo de nuevo para recordar la infancia.... vale la pena
5,Heidi,"I love this childrens classic and bought it for my granddaughter, age 8.- Since it is for young readers, the print in this particular book, is not age appropriate. It is very fine & small, overwhelming the reader. It should be much larger, with less words on page."
5,Cool,Love this book reminds me of Pollyanna !!!!! !!!!!!amazing whatThe mountains can do love love love this amazing book!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,more free classics!,"Hoping the Kindle library continues to offer great classics like Heidi for free.What else can I say, it's a classic novel and it's free."
5,Best children's literature for adults!,"My granddaughters had read this book and were surprised I never had. So I wanted to share in their delight. I was not disappointed! The book captures the innocense and unselfishness of a little girl whose greatest love is taken from her. This classic is well worth reading whether you are young or ""young at heart!"""
5,Very fun to read & stress releasing,"The days when reading it was fun, I would say was in my free time when I was in middle school. Good story to read when school just brings stress. Can also be helpful when in college or work place."
3,"OK, but cheap feeling overall","This is a paperback CreateSpace book, which I have learned means is printed and bound by Amazon directly (?). The previews looked fine, but when I had the actual book in my hands, the paper used for pages was thin, rough and felt cheap. I also found the font difficult to read (seems darker in person than it appeared onscreen in the preview). We had bought the book to read together with our child and this is not the version for us--I will be returning it to find a higher quality version for our library. I am sure if you just want to own the text of the book, this would do it, but I am looking for better quality reading experience overall."
5,Delightful!,"I have always loved Heidi ever since I was a little girl. The way she delights in the smallest of things helps me to accept how lucky we are to llive in a world filled with such beauty. I reccomend this to readers of all ages with a bit of patience, who don't mind reading thick books."
5,Beautiful,This book is beautiful. The sentiment behind the story has made it a classic tale that has been passed down from generation to generation. It should not be overlooked by our own.
2,Heidi,This book was slow and boring. There was no climax and stayed one speed throughout the whole book.I didn't like this book at all
1,Heidi,"To me, Heidi is much too slow and does not keep my attention. I do not recommend this book to anyone who needs something fast-paced. Heidi was not a very enjoyable book. Also, one of my other friends has read it too, who has the same opinion on the book as I."
1,Heidi,"I never got to listen to it! I had to send back the CD because it wouldn't play. Then, when I got the second CD, it did not play either. I still haven't had time to send the CD's back yet. It is most inconvenient. I think CD's should be tested before they are sent. At least, they should begin to play! Georgann Kates"
3,The Hills - Down Hill,"The only reason I bought this episode to watch, I couldn't remember how weird Heidi looked after her decision to undergo a disgusting amount of plastic surgery. After I saw her face, I shut it off. I was a huge Lauren Conrad ""The Hills"" fan. Although I do like Kristen, the show just wasn't the same w/Conrad. The seasons after her, I felt were just pure ridiculousness. I mean , c'mon....if Spencer was REALLY that crazy and looney, he should have been locked up in a padded room."
2,Still Waiting,I cannot review the product as i am still waiting for it to arrive in the mail. I had to request a second replacement order as the first order from November dThe Hills: Season 6id not arrive. I am still waiting on both orders.
1,Not Happy :(,I was really disappointed with this purchase. On the products page it says that it is for all DVD ranges so I was expecting that it would work in Australia. When it came though it was actually only able to be watched in America so it was a waste of $25.00
1,Double check DVD zones before purchase,"Unfortunately the item description stated that this DVD could be used in all types of DVD players. I live in Australia and upon recieving the item it clearly states on the cover zone 1, which doesn't work in Australian DVD players. Luckily Amazon.com refunded me!"
