3,Need to fine tune the product.,"Goes together easily, construction a little flimsy, comes in three sections, sections do not bolt together so if you want to move the rack to a new location you can't in one movement. Biggest draw back rack bearly fits two bicycles."
2,It Works But What A Pain,"There was another review that was right on the mark: the pieces do not fit together well. In fact, I had to pull out my tool box and in particular my hammer (the ""Persuader"") to get it together. It was quite an undertaking. Once assembled, it was ""wobbly"" and I anchored it to the wall even though it is a ""gravity"" rack. So much for gravity. All in all, I won and beat the beast and it does work. It was, nonetheless, poorly made and a complete pain to assemble. Be warned, you will need to work to get this put together."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The price was right on these bike stands. They were the least expensive I could find, but they were a challenge to assemble. There were some welding bumps where the supports were supposed to hook into the main part of the frame. In order to hook up the supports, I had to spend about an hour filing down the bumps. Also, the plastic end caps for the base will not stay in. They keep popping out.Once I got the things together, they seem to work just fine and I'm glad I got them."
3,Practical space saver for garage,"I just received this bike stand, and putting it together was super easy requiring no tools. Note that it requires at least one bike on the stand to be able to stand upright, otherwise it falls backwards (they could have extended the U-shaped base just a tad longer towards the rear.)Unfortunately, one of the arm brackets had a faulty weld that held the hook holding the bike resulting in the arm hook detaching off the arm bracket. Looking at the design of the arm hook assembly, I'd warn anyone to be careful when attempting to twist the hook to a different angle - first loosen the Philips screw under the rubber cover.I'm hoping I can return just the arm bracket without having to ship the entire package back."
3,Holds the bikes but it's not really a freestanding,"I bought a couple of these stands and mounted four of the bikes I had on them (two each of course). The problem is that unless the bike is big and well balanced (front/back) the stand will bend over due to the middle joint. It's on the verge of being dangerous and so I don't let my kids be around it. Of course it comes with screws to attack to the wall, but it's supposed to be free standing and the screwed are against a child pulling the bikes rather than a permanent fixed solution when holding bikes passively.The stand is holding the bikes gently and in place using a rubber coating on the hooks and you can adjust the hooks' height.I wouldn't use this stand as a free standing bike rack.Pros:- Holds two full size bikes- Gentle firm holding of bikes- Looks nice and impressiveCons:- Rather unstable- Requires perfectly balanced leveled ground."
2,"It could work, but it did not for me","The ""Gravity Freestanding Bike stand"" did not work for me. I could see the product working if it was firmly bolted onto a wall, but ""free standing"" did not work. In the instructions it recommends you put the safety bolt, but as poorly as this product stood up, it would just have ripped the bolt out of the wall. It needs to be fastened securely to a wall with more than just what it came with.One good thing is that it was very simple to assemble. Also, the material felt sturdy... it just didn't manage to balance as advertise, at least not for me.I don't recommend this product unless you plan on bolting it to a wall."
2,"Poor quality, look elsewhere","We purchased this bike rack a little over 2 years ago. Not only does the rubber covering easily tear and come off the two pieces of metal used to hold each bike, but the metal column does a poor job of holding the top bike without a constant fear of it collapsing on whatever you have below. Have something custom made at your local metal fabrication or welding shop instead of buying this poorly made product."
5,Great bike rack!,Very happy with this product. Installed in our garage to help with clutter and they have done the job. I would highly recommend using included screws to secure top of stand to a stud. Makes them much more stable.
4,Great Product,"I looked and looked for a bike rack that suited my needs. This one was it! I've since mounted this thing to my wall in my garage, and have my wife's and daughter's bikes securely out of the way. I gave this a 4 star because I wish they incldued a longer lag bolt (which I went to the local hardware store and bought) and some sort of clips so you could latch the bikes into the arms once they're hanging (for safety reasons)....but I will most likely buy another one as I recent purcahsed a bike for myself and love the fact of getting it up off the floor and out of the way (especially in winter when it's not being used at all)."
4,Novel and useful,"Definitely does the job. Easy to set up and use. Does work as free-standing unit, though a bit unsteady. The directions recommending using an included fastener to attach the top of the unit to the wall, but I haven't done so, and it hasn't fallen over. I would recommend this to a friend."
3,pakscott,"They should rename this the gravity fall down rack. To safely store bikes, plan on securing it to the wall. I'm using it in the garage, so it wasn't a big issue. Spent $1.99 on cement. Filled the base tube and the first vertical tube. Added some weight to the base, but not enough to compensate for the rack's inherent instability. I looked at adding lead to the base, but the cost exceeded that of the rack. If you truly need a free standing bike rack, look elsewhere."
3,Not bad but a little flimsy,"Pros:inexpensivelooks niceeasy to installholds men's and women's bikescons:must be secured to the wall (not sure why it's called ""Freestanding"")cannot support my bike that has a bag rack on the back (the metal arms bend because of the weight distribution)"
1,Just like the picture - but USELESS,"The stand looks and does just what it should. But it's in no way a space saver. Infact it take a lot more space then the two bikes put next to each other. You need a whole wall of empty space to use this stand, while I could have put two bikes between any two things in a space filled with stuff. So I will be returning it. The only thing it does is keep the bikes off the floor...if that's important."
1,Gravity too much,Put the stand together. Lifted the bike to the top rack and the hook immediately broke off. Looked to see that the spot weld was very poorly done. Makes me think the rest of the welds may be as bad. Think this stand would be prone to breaking apart.Poor workmanship. I'm done with Racor.
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware! This rack is not as advertised.To start, the box that the rack came in was so disheveled it looked like someone had already opened it. Additionally, the pieces themselves were dirty and had scratches all over. Assembly of the rack was easy, however the pieces of the vertical post do not lock into place tightly which results in complete instability. The top section of the vertical post leans away from the wall ~1/2 foot instead of resting against the wall. When I placed a bike in the top rack, the whole thing almost came crashing down because of the severity of the lean.I do not recommend this product which is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to it."
3,I agree with others,"I agree with many of the other posts. When you join all the pieces the stand is way too wobbly. I won't hang a hat on it much less 2 bikes. Per the advice of one person's post, I ordered 2 braces to see if I can clamp the pieces tighter together. The rack is barely standing on its own in my garage. Once I get the brackets, I will see if it works better. Otherwise, the rack looks nice."
4,Bike stand,The bike stand was very easy to assemble. It fits both my bike and my son's bike easily. You have to work a little to adjust the arms to hold the bikes level. I did not secure it to the wall but it supports the bikes without any problem and doesn't seem to have any problem with staying upright.
1,not recommend,this stand is definitely not freestanding. One must screw the stand into the wall in order to secure the bikes.Not claimed as it advertised.
3,Pretty good product,"It arrived several days late in spite of my trying to rush the order. It is somewhat unstable unless you use the stabilizing screws against the walls which are labelled as ""optional"". Take my advice, it is NOT optional. You also have to realize that the bike support hooks all come facing in the same direction and that you have to loosen the screws holding them and turn them to the right direction, if you do not, they will all face in the wrong direction making them unusable. This step is not in the assembly directions. I would put them there for neophytes like me. Once I got all the pieces working and stabilized it on the wall, it is a very sturdy stand and it looks good!"
4,good buy,purchased this Item from amazon easy to assemble don't understand why some people had trouble?? Only complaint they give you a 3inch screw to hold it to wall but directions say to use a 4 inch screw. would recommend to a friend
4,Saved my garage,"This is the second Racor Pro PLB-2R Two-Bike Gravity Freestanding Bike Stand that I purchased. Without these stands I would not be able to fit our bikes (2 Road / 2 Mountain) in a small one car garage. They ship in a suprisingly small box, are easy/quick to assemble and a great way store your bikes whether you ride daily or on a less frequent basis."
5,Great product!,"Have owned this product for a few months and I've enjoyed it. Never had a problem with it.One small complaint:I live in an apartment so obviously I couldn't really take advantage of the hook you connect to the back. Instead I have to just lean it against the wall, which isn't a problem. but it would be nice if the company offered some optional cushion that you can easily remove if you'd rather use the hooks.I was okay taking care of that problem myself though. I just got an old yoga mat and measured a piece big enough for the area that would be hitting the wall and super glued it. Problem solved!"
1,Junk Rack,"This is a piece of crap. The advertising is all BS. You WILL need to anchor this piece of crap down to a wall stud with a screw if you don't want the whole thing wobbling around. Certainly NOT as advertised.The three pieces never seemed solid enough when they were put together, and the box it came in was very battered. Some of the flanges were bent on the rack.Overall, this is trash. Save your money and go elsewhere. Any business that falsely advertises their products don't deserve your money.I rate this one stars just because there's no option to rate it 0 stars. AVOID!!"
1,Piece of Crap,"I'm not exactly sure how this thing has gotten such high praises, but it's nothing short of worthless. It's highly unstable, unless it's attached to the wall, at which point, I question why I would buy this unit, when I could just buy a wall mount, which takes up less space.I put my bike on it and it toppled over and we're not talking about a 100lbs huffy, we're talking about a 20lbs carbon bike!I don't recommend buying this! There are better solutions out there."
3,Good for road bikes,"This bike rack is great for some and truly bad for others. It will work great if you have two light road bikes. If your bikes are pushing 20 pounds, things are going to get interesting. Like other reviewers' have said, this is a lot of shaped metal for $50. If you are creative and have access to Gorilla Tape, tools, and a drill, most of the problems with the poor fabrication can be easily modified. When I received my rack (that's what she said) the top part was not even drilled out for the handles. Customer service was great and a new drilled section was shipped at no cost. Overall if you are looking for a no hassle fix look elsewhere, if you don't mind making it work, it's a cheap fix.One last note, if you are putting some expensive bikes on this thing you might want to reinforce the end of the handles because the welds are extremely weak."
1,Not happy at all,"I first starting putting this rack together the moment I got it. Once I really got into it, I thought for sure there were pieces missing. It was not stable at all and swayed if I even touched it, forget putting bikes on it. So I tried screwing the top portion into the wall with the screw and anchor provided. It still was not at all stable and the entire thing came crashing down on me. I've now taken it apart and put it back into a box. I'm going to contact the company and ask for a refund and will never recommend this product to anyone."
2,"Flimsy, and poorly constructed","The bike rack is easy to assemble, and does (sort of) stand up on its own, but leans away from the wall and should probably be anchored with the optional hardware. One of the moveable arms had a poorly welded piece, and doesn't fit right in the slot that it is made for. I had to pound it in place, and now it is very dificult to remove."
2,Misleading,"This product says that it is freestanding when in fact it needs to be mounted to a wall, nore do I see what advantage gravity Takes on in this product"
2,Bike Rack,I expected it to be a liitle more sturdy. The piece that holds the two straight pieces together could have been designed better.
2,Very unstable and dangerous rack,"This product is NOT a free standing bike rack. It is very unstable and will fall over easily. Do not buy if you can't drill into the wall to hold it up. Even with the stand screwed into the wall, the different pieces do not line up straight, so it is still not safe and looks tacky. Do not buy this product. Spend a little more and buy a safe rack."
1,Not what described,Beware. This is NOT a freestanding rack. I called the manufacturer and they say it must stand against a wall and for best results you should anchor this to the wall with the bracket provided.
1,tripsteam,Piece of junk. I would put my bikes outside and rust before I use it. Amazon was great on the return.
2,DO NOT TRUST REVIEWS OR STAR RATING,"Amazon is mixing in the reviews from the PLB-4R and the PLB-2R and giving both products the average of ALL the reviews. Which is why you see awesome reviews on the PLB-2R page talking about how good it is at being completely freestanding... and negative reviews on the PLB-4R talking about how you need to secure the top to the wall.If you expand all the reviews and look close enough you'll see which product the review is ACTUALLY about.This is likely happening on many more products on amazon. So NEVER trust the 5-star rating average information, you need to read the reviews and make sure it's about the product you're interested in.I'm giving 2 stars because I'm forced to put something. I'm placing an order for the PLB-4R and will review once received."
3,Basic Function,"Works Ok. I lean it against the wall since it won't freestand too steadily. The bikes, even when the holders are max spread, still hit each other unless I move them this way and that, primarily the top tire on the bottom handle bars. So big bikes may have a real issue. Otherwise, it does OK"
4,Not Freestanding,This looks great but beware; this stand must lean against the wall to work. It is NOT freestanding.I do not have the space for that and had to return it before assembly.
3,Racor Freestanding Bike Stand,"This product is only ok. It is not tall enough to be able to keep 2 full size bikes separated. In other words, the tire of the top bike hits the seat or the handlebars of the bottom. Disappointing."
4,Serves the purpose.. a little awkward though,"I guess it serves the purpose for the price. It is a little awkward though. The two bars that form the vertical column dont fit in perfectly while leaning against the wall as a result of which there is a slight angle at the joint.. makes it look a little unstable. I did have to bolt the thing into the wall.And yeah - trying to hoist two bikes (one ladies and one mens) was next to impossible. I can see putting two mens bike, but with the slope that a ladies bike has, it makes it imperative to put one bike on the floor..."
3,Not a free-standing stand,"I expected this to be a free-standing stand, but the instructions tell you to put the unit against a wall and recommend that it be secured to the wall. It holds my bicycles OK."
3,Functional,"I was looking for a rack for my garage. For the price this rack is quite adequate. The box came in pretty bad shape; scraped, dented, and taped together. Some of the pieces inside were slightly bent, but nothing I couldn't fix. The rack is extremely easy to put together.If you are looking for an inexpensive rack for your garage this is a good choice. If you are looking for something to put inside an apartment/house, keep looking and plan on spending more money."
3,Assembly was far more difficult than it need be,"The assembly of this item requires bolting through a series of pre-drilled holes in tubular parts that are male-to-female fitted, the second hole threaded. This is on the oval base assembly. If the pre-drilled holes don't match exactly you will have a problem. They didn't and I did. I got it together with a lot more work that it should have been, and with the threading on one hole stripped.The U shaped bike holders bend much too easily to suit me.Not all of the tools listed listed for assembly were there, not a problem for me but might be for those who do not have tools, and some of the hardware was loose in the large carton.The design of this item is excellent. The manufacturing engineering, mmmm, not so much."
2,A bit shaky,"Thought I'd purchase this to better organize my garage. The vertical bar is composed of three pieces: top, middle, and the base. There is wiggle room at the connection joints. As a result, the unit will bend towards the front and lean away from the wall, even when it is not loaded. My unit pulled away from the way at least three to four inches. You will definitely want to install this where you have something to strap the vertical bar to; ideally some studs where you can anchor the screws for the straps."
3,freestanding?,"i enjoy the need for no tools to assemble, and the general shape and size of the stand...but there is absolutely 0% chance of it free standing or even leaning on a wall without the mounting screw..which others have complained is too short but it worked fine for me, the fact that it needs to be mounted though means you need to find a stud which means its actually only useable in a limited amount of places, i got lucky that there was a stud where i needed one."
5,Great stand.,I needed something stylish and solid in my newly refinished garage. I purchased two stands and they worked wonderful. They're very solid and hold the bikes well. Very pleased with them.
3,Decent stand,I agree with the other review which advise this stand is not very sturdy. Once you put the bolt through it and into the wall it helps a lot. They should have included bolts which would have connected the individual pieces. I ended up going out and doing so in order to make it sturdier. Overall it does the job needed.
2,Made me nervous,"This rack is very flimsy and made me nervous even after screwing the top to a stud. There are multiple pieces that loosely fit together. I am really surprised that many people give this product 4 stars. In the end I had to drill holes into the metal and used ""L"" brackets at the top and then used some pieces of metal to hold the pieces together better. Now, it is sturdy, but this was after a few hours of ""alterations"". It is not a product ready to go out of the box. I wouldn't recommend buying it."
5,Perfect for Apartment,"This storage bike rack worked out better than we thought, especially because it is so easy to use! It's balanced so well that even my wife, who's 5'5"", can get the bike off the top holder without it toppling over. Excellent purchase for any situation."
2,Spend More Money....,"I just got this today. It was extremely easy to set up, which worried me since it will be loaded with two bikes.First of all, it swayed and leaned considerably. So I took the bikes off, re-arranged everything and tried again. No luck, it leans even more now. Not to mention while trying to get the bottom bike off it caught on the top bike and everything came tumbling down on me. That was fun.I bought this because I live in an apartment complex where I can not mount anything to the wall. However, this does need to be mounted, otherwise it is dangerous. It does come with screws to mount it, but this does me no good. It may be a good buy if you can mount it.Also, it is not much of a space saver. Imagine two bikes side by side, they would take up less space!All in all: KEEP LOOKING and SPEND MORE MONEY,(This is priced low for good reasons!)"
3,Racor PLB-2R Gavity Bike Rack,"I was disappointed in how unstable it is when put together. The individual pieces themselves are very sturdy, but as a unit, it wobbles. I don't see how you could use this as a bike rack without inserting it into a wall stud, which they list as ""optional""."
2,Too much sway to be safe without mounting to wall.,"Product components are constructed well (by themselves -- read on). The bike ""arms"" attach to the rack securely. However, the main vertical spine of the rack joins together so loosely, that there's too much sway in the upper portion of the rack with a bike mounted on it. Securing this rack to a wall is a must, or, adding hardware of your own to firm up the joints in the product. I would NOT purchase or use this product otherwise."
2,Bendable material,"The bikes hold and it's stable, but the material is bendable and cheap. The was not welded properly and I had to manually fix it in order to put the pipes together. The first time I use dit one of the handles bent the first time I used it with the weight of the bike.It's made of cheap, bendable materials and not put together very well. It works, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you want a really cheap price and cheap quality option."
1,Not Freestanding,I don't know why it says freestanding in the name because it has to be placed against a wall to keep from falling backwards when the bikes are removed. It's not freestanding so I'm returning it.
5,Great and Works Perfectly!,"I will cut to the chase and will be briefly. I am a consumer who always relies/checks the reviews of a product. I bought this rack 8 weeks ago. Based on this span of time and my observation, this rack...Rocks! It works perfectly and it is really a space saver. And it is easy to set up. It is pretty sturdy I didn't even use the screw anymore. I use this rack for my bike and my wife's bike. I highly recommend this rack."
2,Poor sense of balance,All parts and pieces were in the box and it was easy to put together. But the floor legs are so short that it will not stand upright unless there is at least one bike hanging on it. The three sections of the frame fit together loosely and tend to allow sagging in the upright when bikes are loaded on it. It is also not tall enough to put our two adult size bikes on it and keep them separate. I will keep it and bolt it to the wall. I just wish this had been better engineered in the first place.
4,space saver,"It is a definitely space saver, easy to install, and ""stable"" if you use screw that comes with it and screw it to the wall. Hence, I'm very satisfied with my purchasing."
4,Excellent Bike rack for the money.,"I looked at a couple bike racks and most were priced 2-3 times this price of this model. This was easy to assemble and does the job, holding 2 bikes securely in a relatively small space."
3,Somewhat disappointing,We tried it a couple of different places and decided it was easier just to leave the bikes on the floor. It leaned and really didn't save any space. Just put the unit on sale on Craigslist.
1,worst purchase ever,"The pieces would not fit together, after hours of trying lube, force and then the hammer, nothing worked. One of the tubes finally split and now there is no hope of making it work. It seemed like a good idea, but I was just taken for $60.00.Don't buy this product"
1,"Doesn't hold one bike, much less two","I purchased this product to hold two ""city commuting"" type bikes (ie not mountain bikes, not racing bikes). Setup was very easy, but it was unable to hold even one of the bikes without tipping over. I can't say for sure if it is because our apartment floor is slightly uneven or whatnot, but regardless, this product wasn't able to handle it."
4,Easy set up.,I put this together in 10 minutes and hung 4 bikes on it with no trouble. Worked as advertised. I could use another one. Great space saver.
5,Great rack,"Saves me heaps of space in my apartment. I am thinking of getting another one, because I seem to not be able to stop getting new bikes."
1,waste of time,"This stand wouldn't even hold itself up, much less two bikes. We live in an apt were I'm not able to secure to the wall. Don't waste your time or money on this. Amazon does stand behind what they sell, which is the only bright thing about this transaction."
3,Racor 2 bike stand,"OK so I read the mixed reviews on this product and ordered two of them.I totally agree with the others that say the product is lacking..It went together quick but is super wobbly and unstable. I was not expecting much for the low price but the two I received were a disappointment..I am a professional welder and will have to weld all four of the main pieces together to make this thing safe to be around. With two of my 24"" BMX bikes (25lbs each) on it the top leans out 6 3/8 inches form the wall. While the bottom is touching ..Also no matter what I do it leans almost 3 inches to the left and is super wobbly..The people who stated in their reviews that they did not need to bolt/screw it to the wall must have gotten a completely different Item than I did.."
5,Great Bike Stand,"This stand is great. Stable, compact and secure. We can fit it in between our cars in the garage with plently of space. The kids can get their bikes off of it with no problem. I am getting another one."
1,Disappointing,"Received the package with holes in it. One minor part, a plastic end-cap, was missing. I put the stand together per the instructions and it would not stand upright. There was a manufactory flaw. I exchanged the stand for a new one and it was flawed as well. The stand was crooked. I returned the second one for a refund. Very disappointing. This product shouldn't even be sold."
3,Stands alone against wall only,Described as stand alone but in reality will work only when leaning against a wall.Add velcro padding so wall not scratched.Better to anchor with hardware
4,"Works great, looks great","I bought the Racor Pro 2-bike Gravity Bike Stand because I moved to a new place with extremely limited garage space. The bike stand solved my problem of how to get my 2 bikes out of the way. It's easy to assemble, attractive and works great."
4,Great Value!,What a great value!Not only did I find the Racor bike stand priced right it was easy to install and very stable. I used the accompanying anchor to secure it the wall to make sure it does not fall if someone accidentally bangs into it. With free shipping it was the best value I found on the net!
4,Works well,Easy to put together. Needs to lean against a wall for stability. Can be bolted at the top(bolt provided) but isn't necessary. Holds 2 bikes as advertised.
5,Easy to install,Great space saver in the storage room. Installs in 2 minutes. Recommended to screw it to the wall.
4,"2 bmx bikes, free stands. no wall needed","Unlike some reviews, my bike rack really does free stand. i don't have to lean it against a wall.My setup: Hardwood floors, 1 old school GT mach one bmx, and 1 ARES DITA flatland bmx bike. Both are on the rack pointing the same direction simply because if I set them in opposite directions, the wheel from the top bike, will rub against the bottom bike's handlebars.This looks WAY better than have my bikes just lean against the wall. I give it only 4 stars because it still feels a bit flimsy. Since I'm from california, it will definitely fall down during an mild earthquake."
5,JUST AS DESCRIBED,"EZ to assemble, arrived earlier than expected. No blemishes, heavy duty, easily handles two bikes."
4,exactly as advertised,"I don't usually review stuff. These were perfect. Just as advertised. Easy to assemble, very versatile. Fit all 4 of my bikes, each with a pretty different frame design, without any problems."
5,Makes the garage so much nicer!,Took 5 seconds to put together withou directions. Looks great and is so cheap. Saves the bikes from getting damaged and the car. Best one I own is the RACOR!
1,Easy to assemble but bad design,"Got my bike stand today. The piece I got was defective and didn't lean against the wall straight.Also, the gear cable which runs underneath the cross bar of the bike will be under pressure when the bikes are hung on this stand.Definitely not good for the long term as it will possibly loosen or damage the gear cable. I think this is a bad design.I am returning this right tomorrow!"
5,It works great without nails.,"Thanks God, it works. I have read many reviews on untrue nail free (gravity) bike racks. Since I live in a rental apartment, no nail on the wall is a must when I consider buying any house good. This product is an ace."
3,Racor Pro PLB-2R Bike Stand,"I found the stand not to be ""freestanding"". It must be bolted to the wall for stability. The brackets for resting the bikes are not the best design for holding the bikes."
4,Works as advertised- mostly,The bike stand was easy to put together and holds the two bikes effectively. The ability to vary the height if the two arms allows the bikes to be suspended correctly and not tilted. The only thing I would add is that the product name and literature suggests that attaching the stand to a wall is optional and suggests that simply leaving it freestanding against the wall is an option. I would not recommend that. It needs to be attached to the wall for you to have any confidence in it staying upright.But it's an inexpensive article that mostly does the job it claims.
3,"Only holds one bike, doesn't stand up straight.","1. The packaging was poor and the base was badly scratched when I received it.2. I'm 6'2"" and I have two tall bikes. The rack is too short for both of them. With the top bracket at the highest setting, the bottom bike won't fit below it. I paid a welder $30 to change the angle of the top bracket so that it goes up 45 degrees. Now there is room for the second bike. Now the rack costs $80.3. The joints in the rack are wobbly, so my rack tilts to the right about 5 degrees. I think it's ugly. I'm going to screw the top of the rack into the wall to fix this. That kinda defeats the purpose of a ""gravity"" rack.Now that I've got it fixed up, it does what it's supposed to. Kind of a pain but it works, and it's still pretty cheap at $80."
4,So far So good,"I wanted a bike rack that wouldn't take too much space and have the option to put more bikes on other than my own. I found this one and read the reviews about it being wobbly, but to my surprise the base can be pretty sturdy if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. So following the instructions I got the base to sit fairly level on the concrete floor and was a little upset about the hooks that hold the bike up and noticed them to be bendable plastic. I found that I could bend those enough to hold the bike sturdy and in place so problem fixed. Overall, I like the design and the number of bikes it can hold, but would have liked a better hook for the bikes to rest on. Then again bike frames come in different shapes and sizes as well as frame thickness, so it was probably best that it does bend to adjust to different bike frames."
4,Bike rack works but may have flaws,"I assembled the rack in 10 minutes. Holds 3 adult bikes and 1 childs bike no problem. The hooks however are weak, the hook on 1 arm has pulled loose. The hook loosen after only being used twice."
4,Great Item,"This rack does what it says. Really easy to set up and frees up so much space. Holds my family's 4 bikes of varying sizes. And, Amazon had the best price. I had it in 3 days."
4,"It does not make you garage bigger, but it helps","Pros:- easy to assemble- easy to adjust- what you see is what you get (almost)- stable enough with one or two bikes- no drilling, movable- play around and you may discover absolutely unpredictable place for it (I did)Cons:- it is not *really* easy to adjust it initially to hang two bikes - plan to spend 15 minutes shuffling your bikes here and there (good exercise, though); also note that at the product picture the top bike is half a feet higher than the stand - that may not be your case (not mine, for sure, but two bikes still fit)- plastic parts (there are some covering rotating hooks connections) break easily, though it does not break the product- it is not very stable without bikes - not dramatically, just be carefull; Racor includes parts to attach top of the stand to the wall, but to my mind that defeats the whole idea of ""freestanding""Conclusion: good, solid (speaking of metal parts), cheap product. Works well."
4,Product as good as advertised,The rack works well for 2 bikes. No need to secure to a wall but you can if you want. If you do secure w/the top bolt it does come off from time to time and need to be refastened.A definite must have if you need to save on space. I have mine inside the house and it works great.
5,perfect!,"This is saving us so much space, I love it! Didn't use the wall mount and no accidents yet..."
4,Very satisfied with my purchase,"This is a relatively inexpensive bicycle storage option for a place with limited floor space. It is a practical design, better balanced than I suspected at the time of purchase. It is slightly more movement between joints, but it is probably a consequence of its simple assembly."
3,good basic rack,"I like that it stacks the bike however they do touch each other (my bikes are 20"" with 29"" tires). It it also very unstable without bikes loaded on it. Otherwise it is a great rack and looks good in a mud room or similar room."
4,Good Value for the Product,Installation was very simple and did not require tools. I did have trouble assembling one of the arms that holds the bikes since the holes in pole and the pins in the arm didn't quite line up. I may be able to fix this though.
4,good product for the money,"Nice rack for a garage or area with low traffic. The price is unbeatable for a bike rack, but it has a chance of toppling over if you don't set it up right. Don't have kids running around it since it may topple over. Overall, I'm happy with it since my bikes are stored away from foot traffic."
5,Great way to store bikes out of the way,Great item. Fits up against the wall and is easily secured to the wall. This Bike stand is perfect for the garage. Easy to assemble. I had it put together and secured to the wall in less than 10 minute. I wish I would have bought it sooner.
4,Works for Me,"They must have made product improvements since some of these older reviews were written. I purchased this 2/2012 and it worked very well as a freestanding bike stand. I had read the reviews that it was wobbly and needed to be fastened to a wall and I was prepared to do that but it didn't need it. Setup and assembly was super easy (less than 10 minutes) and it holds four bikes (road and mountain) just fine. For me, freestanding works perfectly."
4,Solid for the price!,"I was looking for a rack that would save space by storing my bikes vertically without having to drill into the wall. This seemed to be the best option.This rack came out of the box and was assembled in less than 5 minutes. It does require that you lean it against the wall, and has the option to anchor as well, but I haven't done this as I've moved the rack a time or two and may do so again.The only thing that would really improve this rack is if it were freestanding.I do recommend placing something (I used a small piece of rubber flooring) between the wall and the point of contact to prevent any damage or scuffing.This rack is a great value for the cost."
2,Bike rack,"Package was ripped upon arrival. The bike rack is not very good quality, at least not the one I received. With two bikes on the rack it bends forward and is very unstable. The rubber trim that protects the bike from scratching ripped just from putting the bike on with no other movement of the bike. Very unsatisfied with the product."
5,"Love it, I only wish I had a larger garage for the 4 model!","I love this, in fact it was one of my first amazon purchases ever! I have had this for several years now and it certainly holds up. The kids are not easy with it, pulling the bikes down, putting them up, but it has handled all of their abuse over the years."
1,Ehh stay away from this product!,"Racor actually makes some very good products for mounting bikes but this is not one of them. Very flimsy construction (the main pieces don't even bolt securely together!). It has to be leaned up next to a wall so I don't see how this is ""freestanding"" at all. It would not fit 2 full size mountain bikes. I called Racor and asked if they could send me some kind of extension piece and they refused and told me to return the product, so I did."
3,I guess it serves it's purpose.,"The manufacturer really needs to omit the word ""freestanding"", unless by ""freestanding"" they actually mean ""falls over if it doesn't have any bikes on it"".I like how they include a screw to secure this ""freestanding"" rack to the wall. Hello? It's supposed to be ""freestanding"". I especially like the fact that you couldn't secure it to a wall even if you wanted to because when you put the rack flush up against the wall, the base comes up off the floor. Nice engineering, jacklegs.The parts fit together quite loosely, and the quality is 3rd world at best. However, when it has bikes on it it works quite nice. Bonus points for not needing any tools to put it together. Unless I wanted to secure it to the wall. But I don't need to do that because it's ""freestanding"", right?"
2,A little better fit would be nice,"While this bike rack does fine for the purpose it is intended, I found the construction to be a little shoddy, and I don't like the way it leans forward with two bikes on it. I have a similar rack from another manufacturer, and I don't have the leaning problems that I do with this one. I would highly recommend attaching it to the wall, as it is not a true free-standing bike rack."
1,Horrible,"Very dissapointed in this product. First of all this has been a nightmear to put together because of shoty craftsmenship and parts. When putting together the base unit the holes did not line up. Second, one of the nuts in the package does not have any threading, therefore you can not screw it onto the bolt. Do yourself a favor and go with another company! :("
3,It Leans Forward,"This is a great product only if you want to put a big hole in your wall. I bought this for my apartment and did not want to put the huge bolt in my wall. It works great without the bolt but the center joint fall forward so it is not completely flush with the wall. Its not as tall as i thought it would be. I have my mtn bike on top in the highest position and my road bike sits below. it is not tall enough to hang both bikes so my road bike sits on the ground, so really its just a 1 bike rack. You have to have pretty small bikes to get two to hang. all in all steady construction and a good price."
1,"Rack is not ""freestanding""","After seeing this, I was excited about the thought of a freestanding rack I could move around my garage.There is no way to move the rack around, any attempt at moving it and it pulls apart! None of the connections are secured - they are simply shoved together.This rack has an ""optional"" wall mounting kit - the wall mounting kit is an absolute must. Without leaning against a wall the rack would simply fall over - with or without bikes on it.Not worth the $50 - I returned it, went to Home Depot and bought $5 mounts for the bikes."
2,Freestanding it's not,"The name for this product is quite confusing. It doesn't (as the name suggests) stand freely on its own. It actually leans up against a wall. Which works fairly well, if you have a nice free space on your wall as long as your bike. Which, if you did, you could probably just install some hooks and be done with it. So, in all, not the most useful of products."
4,space saver,"This bike rack was a huge space saver for us...we have 2 adult bikes, 2 kids bikes, and 2 scooters. The adult bikes fit perfectly and are easy to put up and remove. We placed it against the brick wall of our carport and have had no problems."
2,Bad Kindle Port,"Length:: 1:52 MinsOne of my favorite children's books, but it just didn't work well on the kindle. For children's books I prefer text mixed with pictures (vs. alternating between them) and this book didn't do that very well. I will rate the paperback version 5 stars."
5,Wonderful book for siblings,Have always loved Bloom County. So when I was looking for children's books for my nieces I found this and the artwork is fabulous and the story is too cute for words. Great for someone tired of fairy tales and little princesses. The girls loved it very much!
2,"The boy is disturbingly grotesque, the story over the top","I don't think war is humorous, even against space aliens. That boy is bizarre-looking, I'm not sure why the author gave him that appearance. The verses seem to be a direct knock-off of the Dr. Seuss style. The art is beautiful, the story is not particularly warm or appealing - almost a parody of a children's book, for the adults to snicker at."
1,I returned this purchase,"I purchased this book for my 5 year old niece. I'm glad that I read it before I gave it to her because I ended up returning it, instead. The book can be detrimental to a young girls self esteem. The book is about a boy who lies. The boy, Edwurd Fubwupper, has a sister. To get the boy out of trouble, the sister takes responsibility for the lies and than everyone loves her more for doing so. Growing up is hard enough without sending this mixed message to little girls."
2,Dedication dissapointment,"I enjoyed the story of Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big. However, when I read the dedication page I knew I could never recommend this book to others who buy children's books. I do not believe a children's book is the place to make political statements."
4,straightfoward and sensuous!,"Hot and heady...this one has sparks flying everywhere! Characters are well developed and plausible. A fun book that keeps going without any thinning spots. Crosby kept me smiling and heartfelt when necessary. I just wish the cover was more like the characters in the book...Scarlet, appropriately named, is a dynamic character but she looks more the image of Summer on the front cover and vice versa for the book former to this one ""Cause for Scandal"".In fact I became more empathetic toward Scarlet and liked her even better than Summer, her twin. When a man is dumped for a one night stand, his obligations are to himself not the one who dumped him...this was the only thing that irritated me. How could someone even be in anyway angry or hurt about a ""forbidden"" love affair when s/he was the ""cause of the scandal"" in the first place. Go Scarlet and John;I feel you were soooo real & have passed me on the street in true to life forms...A+ for Sue Crosby!"
5,Cowboy Andy,Cowboy Andy was my favorite book when I was a kid. I checked it out so many times from the library that they finally gave me the copy. I was so happy to learn that I could order copies of the book through Amazon for my 3 granddaughters for Christmas.
2,Wonderful table - poor chairs,"We've been using this table just about 2 months. Took some time for your kitchen makeover to be ready for the table. We love the table - it's the perfect size for the 2 of us, and we can add the leaf when we have visitors.But, the chairs are a mess. Already, 2 of them have broken - the breaks are where the legs attach to the bottom of the seat. The piece of wood that holds the two leg spindles has split down the middle. Now the legs wobble, and we're afraid they will just collapse. We're on the look out for some similar chairs that will hold up longer."
3,the chairs,"I have had another dining set, not oak but same type chairs. The chairs with the other dining set are breaking also, except it is the backs of the chairs. I love the looks of this set. However, the chairs are a poor design."
1,Not the version pictured! Buyer beware!,"Beware, the version of The Wall tab pictured is NOT the one that Amazon is selling. It is a newer version. While not bad, I was really expecting the other version after seeing it in a local store. (I liked the older one better...)Amazon, please update your product image and description."
3,"Rhetorical, but ok","I had to read this book for a history class. It provides enough incite on the origin of conservatism in Orange County, but to me, she overemphasizes her status as a historian. Instead of telling one point just once, she repeats it again in another segment, which, as a reader, I already knew because she said it before. She is non-biased in her approach of the conservative uprooting, yet she does seem to make them out to look like the enemy rather than a large group of people that were encouraging enrollment for causes they believed in. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read the word ""Knott"" over and over again."
5,Very useful,"This is a very useful item, in part because it isn't cumbersome when you're trying to drain fat or liquid from a pot or pan. It also takes up less space in your dishpan than a colander would, and you can easily slide it into a plate spot in your dishwasher. Wish they made a slightly smaller one."
4,Great for big pots,"I often make pasta in a big pot and this item is such a convenient item to have around.I don't have to bust out my colander to drain the pasta, instead I just need this thin piece of tool to place over my pot.It's too awkward to use for a medium or small pot since the handle on the sieve and the handle on the pot won't overlap perfectly."
5,Nice item,"Really handy for its purpose, draining out of a pan. The description is confusing (are you getting the 9.5"" or 13""?). The one that they sent me fits maxes out on my 10"" Calphalon pans, however it does fit them quite nicely. You can also use it on smaller diameter pans. I have not had any trouble straining hot water, say from noodles, and avoiding burning my hands. Solid construction. I have gotten several items from MIU and been pleased with them all. All in all I think you will be glad you bought this."
4,Good Strainer But Needs More Center Clearance,"This pot strainer works well except that it is only 3-1/2"" high in the center. So you have to be careful, when draining a pot, not to tilt the pot too quickly or food will fall out over the top of the strainer. The large width allows it to handle 9-10"" diameter pots easily. It is very easy to hold at both ends when the pot has two handles."
5,making my life simpler!,"I cook pasta a lot and hate trying to pour out water without also dumping half the pasta down the drain. This sieve allows me to tilt the pot forward without spilling any food, and the handles makes it easy to hold on to the pot. I'd recommend this product to anybody."
2,The instructions are vague at best.,"I am nearly done with this book and I must say that it has been a rather grueling experience at times. The author needs to improve how he writes his instructions. He'll tell you to do something but won't tell you HOW to go about doing it. And this book is for beginners? It has nothing to do with the software. Maya may have a high learning curve, but if you are willing to work hard at it everyday you will get through it. That said, it seems that the author was in a hurry to write this, and at times rambles on about nothing."
4,Good book but not for Mac Users,"I purchased this book to learn Maya. I am a Mac user and expected to have shortcuts and hot keys listed for both Mac and Window$ OS ... well, not in this book. The whole book is written for WIN users. The author mentions some little things here and there for Mac OS but that's about it. So if you are a Mac user get ready to figure out the hot keys on your own since there will be no Insert key to activate the pivot point on a mac keyboard and etc... very sad since maya is a cross platform application."
3,Not the best for sure. . .,"Sure, this book covers some stuff, but a lot of the information you can learn online/tutorials. Also, I learned much quicker and easier using Digital Tutor's stuff (dubyadubyadubya dot digital-tutors dot com )It's an OK book, but I regret that I bought it."
2,Good X-Mas Gift for single female friends,This book is typical of Cathy humor plus some really good recipes. I am recommending it as a good Christmas gift for single female friends.
5,A Miracle After Two Years of Pain,"I had severe knee pain for two years following meniscus surgery and some complications. I was told about Flex Now from a friend who suggested I try it in combination with Egg Shell Membrane. Since I was desperate for relief, I said I'd try anything -- even oil from the African shea nut tree. It took about 30 days to kick in and 40 days to feel like my old self. I can run and climb steps easily for the first time in over 25 months. You need to stay on these products to have continued relief and that means a monthly outlay of about $60. It's well worth it. By the way the product is 100% shea nut oil. Nothing added."
5,No more pain in my hands!,"I can not take NSAID pain relievers (drugs such as aspirin, Celebrex, and ibuprofen) and was desperate to find something that would help me with the pain in my hands. An employee at a local natural supplement shop recommended Flex Now to me. I have been taking it for about 6 months now, and it keeps me completely pain free. If I stop taking it, the pain comes back within 24 hours. I can not state how much Flex Now has improved the quality of my life, and I have experienced absolutely no side effects from it at all. I highly recommend this product."
5,Flex Now Miracle Formula,"I started using Flex Now about a year ago. I was on several medications from my doctor and getting no results for the pain in my joints and feet. After using Flex Now for a month I could tell a big difference. I came off the doctor medicines with the doctors approval and I feel great. I dont have swelling in my finger joints or in my feet any longer unless I stop taking the Flex Now. They are wonderful! I recommend this product to anyone and everyone who has a problem with joint pain or swelling, you will not regret it. It will improve your quality of life.Michele form Palm City FloridaFLEXNOW, Flexnow Joint Formula - 90 softgels"
2,No significant improvements yet,"I have been using this product for about 45 days for lower back pain caused by facet joint arthritis. The product seems to help some but I would not call it a miracle drug. May be more effective for some types of inflammation but seeing limited help for my condition. Directions for use recommend a 30 to 60 day period until relief may be obtained. I `ll use the remainder of the my second bottle, if still no improvement I'll discontinue its use."
1,disappointed,"This product may be good for osteo-arthritis, but certainly not for rheumatoid arthritis. The manufacturer should state in the literature that this for osteo-arthritis. Product did not help at all - I don't give it any stars."
2,Well...,"I gave it two stars because I like the smell of tea tree. That said, this stuff does not work. Smells like it ought to, but does nothing to combat itchy scalp."
5,Nice healing cream,"This cream moisturishes while not leaving a sticky residue. A good facial cream for delicate skin. As a foot cream it is pure luxury, especially now when it is time for wearing boots."
3,quite disappointed,"this cream might work on cuts, bruises and among other skin blemishes but it does not work on acne. But i kept them for my kids incase they get cuts..."
4,Derma-E tea tree and E antiseptic face cream,"This is a lovely product. i have sensitive acne prone combination skin, and this product allows me to moisturize and treat acne simultaneously. it has a somewhat medicinal smell, but it is very tolerable. I like it!"
3,STINKS!!! the smell is horrible!,I hope this stuff works as it smells like burnt tar mixed with cat pee! it almost makes me gag to have this product slathered on my face!!!
3,Disappointed but I don't regret the purchase.,"It's not as good as people said it was. I think my skin is more sensitive than I thought. :/ I really wanted this to work, though. It helped a little in clearing my skin but I thought I was going to get a good result overnight like how people described in previous reviews."
2,Not the same,as it used to be years ago. I was looking for more coverage..this is very drying and sheer. It does not dissolve well with water. I will not buy this again.
4,Max Factor Pan-Cake,I have been using Max Factor pancake for years and was delighted to kow I could still buy it online as it is no longer avaiable in retail stores. Please continue..
1,this thing stinks,I used it once and it charged my ipod only 80% after about four hours. The next day I tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely. This thing is garbage!
1,waste of money,"It worked for about 6 months and gave up the ghost. Replaced it with a Griffin PowerBlock/AC Charger, a much better product. I haven't had a simple device malfunction like this in years."
2,IM AN IDIOT FOR BUYING THIS,"Ok so, so i ordered this thing on the 10th and it just arived today (19th) nine days later, of course the last day of there so called ""Delivery Estimate"" . The package came from walnut california, i live in humbolt county california, i can dive there in 9 hours9 HOURS!and on another note the thing doesnt want to worki plugged it in my wall and my i pod shuts off, ok coolit finaly starts to work and i unplug it freezes for a second then... shuts offits not somthing i want to trust with my $300 i poddont buy this thing pleaseyou think oooo 2 bucks for a wall chargeryoull be thinking oooo when it frys, electrocuting you instantly putting you in a coma for the next 20 years of your lifepeople you get what you pay forlove, joshua"
1,Stay Away From This!!,"One Year! This thing lasted for EXACTLY One Year!! Then NOTHING!! It completly just stopped working. Yes the price of the product was cheap, but with all of the shipping charges it was about the same price as if I had went to the store to buy it. The disappointment isn't worth the price, it lasted just long enough so that the time limit to return or exchange the product ran out!"
1,Ipod killer potential ire Hazard.,"Had this charger for 2 days. I thought it was working fine till, it blew up. Yes I say blew up. It was plugged into the wall charging my ipod when the plastic case blew off the wall leaving the metal plugs in the outlet. Thank God it blew a breaker in the process. Did I mention that it also killed my ipod. Yep it is now defunct, inoperable dead. Here is the kicker, apple refuses to honor warranty because I was using a non apple approved charger."
4,Simple and works great for me,I bought this charger as a charger to keep at my desk at work. It works great for me. I've purchased other chargers that did not work so I was pleased when this one worked fine. I own the second version of the iPhone.
4,It really bounces,"My daughter loves this toy. She's 13 months. My son likes it too, and we enjoy taking it apart and reassembling it in different configurations. My only complaint is that both halves of the base don't stay together very well."
2,Too flimsy for the price,"While the concept of this toy is great, it was just to flimsy to play with. I bought it for my daughter when she turned a year old. The pieces don't really ""snap"" together so when she would lean on it or try to put the balls into it, it would tip over and completely disassemble. My 3 year old nephew loves the toy but he even has trouble keeping it all in one piece."
1,Doesn't work,"It is useless. Pieces don't hold together, particularly the base and the trampoline. I returned it."
2,This toy has one too many flaws,"I bought this for my young toddler because he's obsessed with balls and bouncy things, and what a disappointment! The ball bouncer works, but only when the parts stay together. The two bases come apart constantly due to poor design. That makes this toy more trouble than it's worth. Secondly, the plastic is so flimsy on this thing that the parts of the tower are constantly becoming misaligned thereby causing the balls to all over.Do yourself a favor, save your money on this shoddily designed and implemented toy."
2,Parts don't stay in place,"I bought this for my 22 month old. The bottom part is separate from the tower but they overlap to attach- not permanently though. Every time my son puts the balls in the tower and puts the slightest pressure on the tower, it disconnects from the base= no allignment so no bounce. Nice concept but unless you wish to reassemble this toy every time your child plays with it, don't bother. Too expensive for what it is as well."
1,Comes apart too easily,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas because I had seen it on the Today Show, but it was a waste of money. It is too flimsy and she falls down trying to pull up on it. And the pieces come apart too easily so she spends more time taking it apart than actually playing with it."
5,"Brilliant, minimalist anime RPG","BESM is an ideal roleplaying game for the anime genre. It is stripped of any overhead and concentrating on what makes anime anime.The rules are fast to run and easy to learn, but with more than enough depth for the genre. This is not GURPS - you are not going to use BESM for every possible campaign you want to run - but it is the acme of anime gaming."
1,"Should have been called ""Little Book, Big Mistake"".","*Some of the artwork is nicely done; a lot of it is little more than childish scribbles. *The book's presentation is at times less than professional; there are numerous spelling and grammar mistakes. *The game essentially has very little to do with anime. For example, in the section ""Role-playing in an Anime World"", the author's advice is to ""Watch lots of anime"". Not very helpful. *The volume is VERY flimsy (79 pages + about 12 pages of almost useless ""resources"". *The rules are simplistic to a fault. The author even states, ""There are many other fine RPGs on the market should you desire a game with a more complex system"". Amen, brother. *Fans of anime and role-playing should instead check out the Ani-Mayhem card game (similar to Magic:the Gathering)."
2,An obsolete volume,"This book is approximately 25 years old and is now obsolete. The direct drive VW engine is no longer common and a number of conversions and new designs are available, and the blower cooled 2-stroke is about gone from the scene.The aircooled 1940's technology Lycoming and Continental certificated designs are still the most common power, but that reflects more a trend toward convenience and uniformity in the homebuilt market-people really want a production aircraft but want to be free of perceived high parts prices and maintenance and want airplanes more fun to fly and challenging than the Wichita product-than a failure of ""the alternative"". Turboprop engines are showing up, in fact, in greater numbers, despite the cost and fuel burn.Except for a historical overview-what was popular in 1983-it's quite useless now."
4,Well Organized Guinea Pig Care Book,"This is a well organized book on guinea pigs for both the novice young owner and a more experienced owner. The graphic designs and page layouts are especially well done. ""Tips From the Vet"" are highlighted effectively for the reader and there is a sprinkling of humor throughout. Almost all phases of guinea pig care are covered in a practical manner for both adults and younger cavy owners. I recommend it highly."
3,good for coin holding,"Make sure to check its real size when you' re about to get this pouch. it measures: 4"" w x 2.75"" H x 1.25"" Dwhich makes it excellent for a LEATHER purse that holds coins.Do not be fooled by its apparant purpose to hold a camera."
4,Pentax Soft Leather Digital Camera Case,Pentax Soft Leather Digital Camera Case for Pentax A10 and A20 Digital Cameras Is a nice small case that fits these cameras.
2,Nice case but the listed dimensions are wrong.,"I ordered this case for my Canon SD 870IS based on the listed dimensions and some of the reviews. Please note, the dimensions are closer to 4 by 2 5/8 by 1 5/8. My camera will not fit. Otherwise the case is of decent quality for the price. I hope these comments help other buyers."
2,Pass this one by,"This album does confirm that Ovations are crappy sounding acoustic guitars. Unfortunately, even the old Gibson couldn't have saved this album of weak recordings and poor performances."
2,Yoko needs to redecorate her Summer home?,"Looks like we're getting down to the bottom of the barrel as far as unreleased John Lennon tracks. I can't fathom why this was released, apart from the need for more money. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not a Yoko basher, but I feel this release is subpar. There is no cohesion (apart from the fact that all tracks are in some way acoustic), and the sound quality ranges from excellent studio to okay home demo. I love most of Lennon's material, but some of the song choices,Woman is the N***** of the World, Luck of the Irish (with Yoko), What You Got, just aren't anything special. If you're looking for something truly excellent from John, check out the newly remastered and expanded Rock and Roll album. Maybe next year we'll get the One to One concerts or at least something more worthy of becoming a part of Lennon's body of work."
4,Classic!,"This has a nice mix of true John Lennon styles : creative and whimsical, stretching the envelope of the times. I really enjoyed this and glad to discover it!"
2,I Should Have Known Better...,"I love the Beatles' work, as a group and individually. They inspired me -- I learned to play guitar by playing along with their albums. Though Lennon was not my fave of the Fab Four, I think he amassed a pretty impressive catalogue of masterpieces and plain old good tunes.Unfortunately, many of his best songs are not included on this album. ""Imagine"" is there. ""Watching the Wheels"" is there. ""Love"" is there. And a couple others. All nice renditions. But the rest is, in my humble opinion, filler. And to make matters worse, the audio quality on a number of tracks is pretty poor. Truly disappointing.I was looking forward to hearing John Lennon unplugged, but this album fell short of my expectations. If you are a hard core Lennon fan, you should buy this album (although you probably already have the box set, so what's the point, really?). Otherwise, give it a pass."
2,What a mistake!,This recording is in such a pure condition that it is clearly only fordie hard fans.Lennons songs are truly amazing no matter what - but this package does not give them justice.Die hard fans - get the albumAll other fans - save your money and get the fantastic Lennon Collection instead.This one sucks!
2,A porly produced Yoko Album,"John Lennons newest release, Acoustic has many flaws.First, The album contains many very rough cuts including those of imagine, real love and Watching the wheels. These track could have very well have been remastered but Yoko had to produce it.Second, The tech, Yoko, have played with a few to many effects such as terribly sounding reverb and underwater chorusey effects and have thrown them on everything! Matter a fact.....it was so bad i shut it off after track five later finding out that the rest were just the same.Also, the version of cold turkey is terrible due to Yoko's imput of John's voice.Over all this has been one of the worst albums released of John's.....thanks to Yoko Ono. If only it had been produced by Jeff Lyne or even his son, Julian."
1,Never should have been released,"Ok, the quality on this album is really really bad. Most of the songs on here are home recordings that should never have been released as an official CD. I can understand releasing this for free so the hardcore fans could hear it. This is at best a bootleg quality recording except they are charging full price and acting like it is professionally done. Which is a complete shame. They tried to ""improve"" the quality of the home recordings and all it did was turn the recording into a really strange tinny, unnatural sound. The is barrel scraping and money grubbing at its worst. DO NOT BUY."
2,Only a gem or two...,There's just no escaping the fact that most of the tracks on this CD are of a quality you might expect from the kind of never-intended-to-be-released demos you could find on KaZaa or Napster. That's not to say they're worthless -- just not what you'd expect from a modern release on a major label.The 'live' tracks work best... especially a terrific live performance of 'Imagine'.The inclusion of guitar tablature for each song in the enclosed booklet is a nice touch.
3,Lennon will live on forever,The best cut is Working Class Hero. Others are fine. Best part of CD is that is has all the words and CHORDS so you can sing and play along. A nice gimmick I'd like to see more of !!Dennis
4,Passionate One,"I just got this today. I'm sure glad I did. The passion John displays in these songs is pure. Great songs with meaning. The best ones are Look At Me, God, Cold Turkey, John Sinclair, and of course Imagine. Get it if you love the truth. The master speaks."
3,Stripped Down and Missing Something,"This album is mediocre at best. It only gets three stars because it is John Lennon playing these songs.This album is like a demo tape. The sound isn't there for most of the album and it just seems like not a lot of thought was put into it. If it had been advertised as ""John Lennon Acoustic Demos,"" I wouldn't feel cheated. That is not the case, however.There are highlights of the album, of course, but even those grind my gears because of the sound quality.Check out: Working Class Hero, Luck of the Irish, Imagine, Watching the Wheels."
2,A Yoko money making scheme!,I was so disappointed that I spent money on this CD. I am a Beatle's fanatic and have never regretted a Beatle's related purchase (except maybe for the bootleg: McCarntney II The Lost Album). This collection sounds like rejects from the Lennon Anthology. They should have remained on the cutting-room floor. The guitar is often out of tune and the playing sloppy. I don't think Lennon would have wanted this stuff released. This is only something I could listen to once; and only as a matter of interest.
2,Lennon Unplugged,"""Acoustic"" should have been a cause for celebration. There were plenty of acoustic recordings and demos in the John Lennon vaults to warrant a 75-minute disc. Instead, we get 44 minutes - with most of the material PREVIOUSLY released. No wonder the bootleggers continue to thrive! Despite a few Lennon gems (notably the superior demo of ""Watching the Wheels""), ""Acoustic"" is a money-grubbing letdown on par with The Beatles' ""Let It Be . . . Naked."""
4,ONE BIG THING MISSING HERE,"And that is the unbelievably great acoustic demo of the song ""Woman"". I would like to buy it. I suspect that it may be on the Dakota Diaries bootlegs, but if anyone knows where I can buy it legaly please let me know. josephmarkdavis@aol.com"
2,working class hero?,"i don't think I'm enough of a Beatles fan to appreciate this album... actually I'm not really a big John fan. truth is i like the Beatles but i don't like the Beatles solo work... which brings this album... it was very hard to get though... at one point i was angered that John wrote a song called Working Class Hero where at the end of the song he begs the listener ""if you want to be a hero just follow me""...i might be wrong but John was never a working class hero...Then there is Yoko.... god how in the hell did he stand her... to hear her sing ""Luck of the Irish"" or hear John complain with her before a recording makes me want to scream ""John!!! why??? why!?!?""the recordings on the rest of the album are crappy and the selection of the songs are poor (ie. ""Woman is the Nigger of the World"").the only saving grace for me was the song Love that John sings so beautifullyi would advise anyone who's not a die hard John Lennon fan to not pick up this record."
3,"Response to NATHANIEL NEASE 'review' on Lennon ""Acoustic""","So basically what you're saying is, if someone is deceased, their music or art sucks and is invalid.""Music has time and a period in which it should be listened to""?! This is hysterical! If ANY art has its time and period, then why not tear down the Sistene (sp?) Chapel in Italy? Or just get rid of the Mona Lisa!Or tell that to the millions of classical music fans who listen to Beethoven and Mozart every day. They're long dead! They must really SUCK!I suppose this pertains to Kurt Cobain as well? It's been TEN years for him!I see you reviewed or bought Papa Roach. Well, when they stop selling records and disappear from memory, tell me the same thing about them.My suggestion to you is simple- grow up."
1,What a sham(e)!,"This CD is the final rip-off of JL's legacy: home demo or live versions of songs that exist in superior versions on his regular albums (especially the non-remixed, original LPs and CDs!) or on the John Lennon Anthology. And these are not simply the cassette-demos cleaned up and presented in style, most tracks are actually treated with some flanging or chorus effect to make the guitar and the voice sound more 'full'. This only results in a cheap, artificial sound, that completely takes away whatever charm these demos might have had for the JL-fan. If you want to play the songs on guitar, you better buy a JL songbook with guitar tabs. 'Real Love' can be found on the Imagine soundtrack album in its pure form. Dont buy this CD!!!"
5,Perfect Insight into development,"This album is a collection of demos and live songs that are meant to expose Lennon's songs completely and to give an insight to the core of his songs.It works. All the songs are just Lennon and his acoustic guitar. So you get the bare essential of the music. This is definitely worth buying if you like Lennon's work.But make sure that you've listened to the studio recordings before exploring this album. I highly recommend the brand new release, ""The Definitive Lennon""."
2,Not for the casual John Lennon listener,"Although I basically enjoy this disc, I was hoping for something a bit more listenable. There are three or four excellent tracks, sampling what John did best ""raw"" and without the trappings of full production sound. However, if you have only a passing interest in John Lennon or are expecting a collection of polished acoustic works, forget it. The sound quality on several tracks is terrible, the vocals are rough (remember, these were sub-demo recordings never intended for release) and you wonder whether Lennon himself would have wanted us to hear them. Maybe. Listen carefully to the Amazon samples from each track before you decide."
3,scraping the barrel; but some good tracks,"i think this latest lennon release was scraping the barrel, and completely uneccesary to his discography. however there are some good songs on here, for example, i love the version of watching the wheels(proberly more than the proper version), and the luck of the irish, imagine, john sinclair, working class hero, dear yoko, and look at me are all great, but theres only about 5 'decent' songs on this album, and some of them are ver bad quality, and only 50 seconds long!it is nice to hear john raw, and acoustic, but i think this was a pointless release...get lennonlegend, or double fantasy instead."
2,Disappointed!,"I was very excited to get this CD as Im a HUGE John Lennon fan. So disappointed! The tracks are muffled and the sound quality is very poor. There is only a few songs that sound clear (one of which is the song that plays when you preview the album so thats very deceiving). Some of the songs, while John is playing the guitar, you can hear Yoko talking in the background. If you want to hear old tapes of John recording in the studio this is your CD. The quality of the sound is what is so annoying...but at the end of the day its John Lennon, and we listen to it anyway."
4,Acoustic,"Even though I admire John Lennon's music very much, I would say that this collection is for fans only. Having said that, however, Lennon fans will enjoy hearing him in the rough, so to speak, since his studio work was quite polished. Some of these songs went through some changes in the process, and hearing them in demo form is really interesting. If you picked up the boxed set ""Anthology"" then you have already heard some of this. As a guitar player, also, I appreciate the chord charts, etc, but it kind of seems like a sales angle. Does anyone agree? Still, i'ts a nice set but how many more repackages can there be?"
4,The way John liked it,"It's great that after 24 years, we have more of John. Are these as good as the versions we all know? It all depends on your musical tastes. In my own opinion, WATCHING THE WHEELS, IMAGINE,LOVE, and REAL LOVE sound better acoustic. A few songs, including GOD, WHAT YOU GOT, etc, are obviously rough drafts that John didn't know where he was going to take them yet. WORKING CLASS HERO sounds just like the album cut. The last song,IT'S REAL is a funny little tune that John probably didn't even expect to be released. It doesn't matter if it's good, IT'S JOHN LENNON! Plus, Yoko cetainly does not need the extra money. I'm sure she simply wanted John's fans to have more of his brilliance. Besides, if you listen to John's music, most of the songs, Beatles included, were played acoustically."
2,Too Much Duplication,"Like so many others, I was very excited about the prospects of this release, but was diappointed (big time) upon purchasing it.Out of 16 songs, only 7 have not been released before. For those completists out there, here's a list of the tracks unreleased before:3.Well Well Well* 5.God* 6.My Mummy's Dead* 7.Cold Turkey*11.What You Got* 13.Dear Yoko* 14.Real Love*Of those, only Well Well Well, My Mummy's Dead and Cold Turkey had no version on the aweome "" JL Anthology"" set from a few years back, which already had a bunch of demos and acoustic tracks. So, all in all, I think Yoko let us down with this one..."
4,A Great Introduction Into the Beauty of John's Songs,"I love the premise of this album to begin with -- so many of John's songs need not be overproduced to really convey the depth of his lyrics and music.Having got this album as a free demo, I can't say it was worth *my* money; but I would definitely suggest it to any John Lennon or Beatle fans. It's a gorgeous album, overwhelming even in its simplicity. Not all of the songs are masterpieces -- but even so, most are catchy and/or meaningful.When I'm already acquainted with an artist, I generally hate ""The Best Of...""/""Essential...""/""Greatest Hits"" albums. This is a nice take on John's songs, however: just John with his guitar."
1,Don't hold your breath on their warranty...,"I purchased this watch a couple of years ago...the tritium coating on the illuminated portions of the watch have faded into nearly nothing with regards to illumination.I sent the watch to Universal Watch Repair, Traser's official repair shop. They wanted $168.00 plus shipping to replace the failed illuminated components.Traser won't cover them, despite their bragging on their websites that the illumination is guaranteed for ten years. They say that it is normal for the illumination qualities to fade and that my watch, which has no illumination left in it, is normal per their guidelines.Interesting that the repair place said it needed to be replaced, but Traser would not honor their warranty...Buyer beware!My friends, much less cool Timex watch has out performed this watch at far less the cost...this is very sad to me.Very Disappointed!"
3,Classic doco,"A comprehensive historic evidence the USA/California/San Franciscoof the late seventies of the twentieth century had been, is of a sure interest to human rights scholars and activists, especially."
5,"You Must See This Documentary - Even if you saw Sean Penn in ""Milk"" 2008","I keep telling all my friends about this documentary that I stumbled across on www.imdb.com. I watched the TV in shock as Diane Feinstein announced to the press that Harvey Milk and Mayor Moscone had been shot and killed and the suspect was Supervisor Dan White. But I never knew that a documentary was made. Even if you have seen the tremendously popular (and now Oscar winning Sean Penn as Harvey Milk) movie, ""Milk"", you need to see the up-close-and-personal interviews with everyone in Milk's life, just a few years after he was assasinated. You will be in tears and it is a completely different feeling than watching the movie - no less moving or emotional - just different. Just as some other reviewers said, the interviews with those who were close to Harvey are amazing. This is one of the most amazing documentaries I have ever seen. I will watch it over and over."
5,Joyous and warm saxophone playing,"I was moved to review this because other reviews make it sound cerebral, or ""difficult"", part tribute to Coltrane, part modernist German literature, and so on.Nonsense! It's a really enjoyable jazz album from start to finish. No duff bits, the leaders sax swings joyously, with a warm tone that induces happiness, and sounds as if he is happy. No skronk at all. The pianist has a kind of liquid fluidity, the bassist has his mournful bits, and the drumming knits it together so well.Perhaps we have been spoilt by the modern jazz of the 80's, 90's, 00's, but this is a relatively straightforward swinging slab of modern jazz that came out a bit ahead of its time and rocks along from start to finish."
5,"""A Little Lemon""","Mark Lemon's is not a famous name, but it should be, for he was the first editor of ""Punch,"" the British humor magazine that was in some ways, for decades, the British New Yorker. The founders of the journal said, when announcing his editorship, ""Every good punch needs a little lemon"" (Mark Lemon was short). To have his collection of jokes, stories, and sayings is to give an insight into part of the mentality behind the magazine. The humor isn't modern American, but some of the zingers are funny. It will me in my own work on older jest books."
3,Sailing,Good for technical operations of a small boat on the deep blue. Not a film for entertainment per'se. Great for the avid landlubber.
5,'re the beginning,This volume contains the start of the best run of Thor tales the comics have produced to date. For anyone interested in Marvel 's take on the character and mythology this is the best place to start.
4,Great DVD,I have followed Michael Card since he began public ministry. I have to rank him in the top ten of Christian artists and also top ten of all singer songwriters. Years ago CCM magizine described him as a Dan Folgerberg like performer. That was all it took for me! This DVD will have all your favorites and more. The only reason I don't give it a five star is that it is not in DTS or 5:1 sound format. The sound is still great though.
5,On target,"Michael, this is so on target, and focused on HIM. Blessings to you. Come back in 2013 for a new start...David Hoyle family"
5,I loved it!,"As I read Dream Tapestry, it struck me how perfectly named the book is. But to say why would be unfair to other readers. All the characters are woven together with the story, each one written so you WANT to know them, you care about them and what happens in the end. They are believable people in a believable situation. Being familiar with the Maryland area, I also enjoyed the descriptions of places I have visited. I felt the book flowed very smoothly from past to present, and drew me into the story with little effort. The whole package was tied up neatly in the end, I didn't have to 'wonder' what happened to these people I cared about. I give it a 10!!!"
3,Enough with Breakout! Please!,"Swing out Sister is about the only popular group I can stand to listen to, and I was looking forward to receiving this collection.The first disc is the best, with many good songs, the second disc is a washout- most of the stuff sounds like elevator music. You can listen to the entire second disc and not even remember what you heard- and nothing to make you hit the repeat button on the CD player. It's not terrible, but you keep hoping that the next song will be better.The third disc is all remixes. Most of them are fine- except for ""Twilight World"" which is irritating- mostly from the stupid voiceovers.And, as the title of this review states- enough with BREAKOUT! There are three different versions of it on this disc. Talk about beating something to death!If you want this collection, look for it on sale somewhere- or try E-bay. It's certainly NOT worth the price they are asking for it here."
4,not perfect,"I like the selection of tunes from various albums over a 15 year time span, and the sound quality's excellent. However, the third disc is basically re-mixes of songs already on the other CDs. Yes, some people want to hear three version of, say, ""breakout,"" but not me. First, the re-mixes are obnoxious. Second, hearing too many version of these popular songs makes you sick of them that much faster... not what you want. I would have used the third disc to include several of their other good songs, rather than these annoying re-mixes. Would Bach or Mozart (or Sinatra) do a CD of remixes like that? just kidding. But, speaking of Frank, I just wishing they had done it ""my way."""
1,expected better quality,I THOUGHT THAT THE QUALITY FOR THE MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. ONE OF THE CARS THE GENERAL LEE WOULD NOT EVEN ROLL. I SHOULD HAVE SENT BACK BUT SHIPPING WOULD HAVE COST ME. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET FOR QUALITY.TONY JOHNSON
4,An excellent intuitive tool.,"The deck is beautifully illustrated with delightful colors and detail. While not your ""typical"" tarot deck, it is similar enough to be familiar to an experienced tarot reader. The major arcana are represented by characters from various ancient children's stories. This set is somewhat complicated to learn initially, but is an excellent tool for intuitive guidance and contact with the inner child which lives in each of us. It is also useful in examining the various fairy tales and stereotypes our culture presents us with as children. While beneficial spiritually with adults, it is also one of the few tarot decks I feel comfortable in using for and with children"
3,Cool Rug,"I debated a long time about paying this much for a rug for my son's room. The price is high, in my opinion, but this rug is really cool. The colors are bold and he was crazy about the planets and space ships. It's large and really became the center piece of his new space room. It had to air out a few days to get rid of the vinyl smell, but once that was gone it was fun to sit on and play. It's not at all plush, this is more of a decoration than anything. But it's a good one and I am happy we splurged on it."
3,The Last Half Made The Book,"I have to be honest with you. I was tempted several times in the first half of this book to give up and not to finish it. But my curiousity got the better of me and I continued on. And I am soooo happy that I did! Once I past the half way mark, I couldn't put it down. The pace picked up, the characters came to life, and it was wonderful! I encourage anyone who starts this book not to give up on it. I believe you will find the patience worth it once you get to the end. I sure did!"
3,Ye Gods! What's wrong with the woman?,"Burke, there are lots of ""fishes in the sea"". This could not have been a match made in Heaven. Heck, I don't even think Hell would have it. With Burke's honor, trust, charm, loyalty, love, not to mention good-looks, Alys still manages to shun the man. Ye Gods! What's wrong with the woman? The only thing a liked about this story was when Alys finally met her dad. A King's Ransom, indeed."
2,Not Worth Finishing,"I am not one for prose, but I did want to say that at some point Alys needs to grow up. The constant conflict or confusion was just too much. I could only get half way thru the book before I decided to quit reading. Read at your risk."
3,TOOOOOO long to the climax!,"Delacroix is a very talented writer, however, it felt as though she was attempting to make certain the required number of pages were filled. I skipped about 50 pages and was still aware of the plotline. Burke was toooo wishy washy for a knighht, Alys' character didn't come alive for me at all. There were some feelings of life in the middle ages, however, the plot could have been in 1999 and played out virtually the same way. I'm all for happy endings, but this was a bit too contrived. THE PRINCESS, also written by DeLacroix is fabulous!!! Strong characters, great plot. Be sure to read that one. And, I will of course read the third part of the trilogy, and hope, with fingers crossed, the charcters jump out at me!"
2,Medieval Romance In A Parallel Universe,"This is definitely a fairy tale. A medieval castle with no guards, and there is not even a hint of medieval life at all. Even the Cook is as literate and eloquent as the lord of the Castle.I just imagine this is all in a parallel universe and continue reading.Things get worse when the hero does a lot of stupid things that compromises the heroine's reputation, and she recipocrates in kind by grumbling and whining but never actually doing anything to rise above her miserable lot.The writing style is never interesting or engaging. Hence, I'm bored flat by Chapter 14."
3,"Mediocre writing, great pictures","Mr. Messick was, for his time, a groundbreaking journalist when it came to organized crime; a reporter known for his guts, his persistence, and his ingenuity. Unfortunately, some of his conclusions have since been convincingly discredited (check out Mr. Lacey's biography of Meyer Lansky, as an example). Part of the problem, too, is that Mr. Messick is just not an engaging or exciting writer. I've always found his style to be pedantic and as dry-as-dust. His prose never animates the events he describes. Also, not a lot of dates or substantiation to some of his stories. However, there are a lot of great pictures."
1,"This is the hook, avoid the line and sinker","This book, like the other non-fiction works by Hubbard, is intended to hook the reader into joining the Scientology cult. Like most attempts at intellectual entrapment, it contains some degree of truth, but is not a valid or honest attempt to offer help.I would recommend that anyone looking to buy this book do research into the life of L Ron Hubbard and particularly the nature of the cult that he created."
2,Don't waste the money,"This book is out of date and a mere compilation of information you can get free from school's websites and from on-line business journals (US News, Business Week, etc.) I bought this after reading a much older version, which offered in-depth reviews of leading programs. I was disappointed to discover that the book had devolved to nothing more than an index of numbers. Definitely save your money!"
4,Great 'til the string breaks!,This one definitely dries the lettuce the best of any I've tried. That's the good. The bad is that the string breaks after about a year.I'm still going to order another one. I tried the X0X one. It's OK but the lettuce just doesn't get as dry as this one.
1,Not as it seems....,"In reading all of the reviews, I carefully chose this product. When I received it, it did not come with instructions, but I thought, no problem, I am sure I can put salad in a bowl and pull the string. I was wrong. I can have a dinner party for 30 people and watch my two kids at the same time while talking on the phone and folding clothes, but CAN NOT get this to spin without the lid flying off.In order to get it going, I needed my daughter to hold the thing down so the top did not pop off. Why has not one person said that the top has no latch feature to secure it to the bowl? If anyone wants to scan and emil me the instructions, that would be great, if not I will give it to my daughter to spin her barbies, like a carnival ride."
3,Bowl Cracked During Shipping,"The string on my old Zyliss spinner similar to this one finally broke after several years of heavy use so I bought this one to replace it. When I received the package, the plastic bowl was cracked (shattered on one side, actually). Other reviewers have noted that the bowl is hard plastic and could crack if dropped. My previous spinner had a similar bowl and it never cracked so I didn't give it much thought when I ordered this. However, after receiving a broken one, I'm hesitant to order another and will buy something else. It's too bad because the I really like the pull-string spinners - they do a great job drying lettuce and it stays fresh much longer. Zyliss just needs to make the bowl more durable."
2,Shouldn't Spinning Salad be Easy?,"I bought this after my OXO spinner broke, and I've had it for a year, and am desperately waiting for it to break so I can get something else. The trouble isn't the string (which might appeal to you if you miss the old-fashioned lawn mowers with the pull-start) but the amount of parts. Most other spinners have 3 parts: a bowl, a spinning drainer inside, and a lid/spinner. This one has a lid AND a spinner top. 4 parts. I know, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but you have to get the lid on exactly the right way or the mechanism doesn't work. It adds an unnecessary step, which gets frustrating when you're just trying to dry some lettuce. The pull string works fine, though sometimes it slackens and doesn't go back into its housing, and you have to kind of coax it back in. A little too much effort."
5,At last. A salad spinner that really works!,"I saw this salad spinner recommended in a magazine, and they were right. My husband who rarely buys anything said, ""Why did you buy this?"" But now he's a convert. He loves it. It's quick, easy, gets greens dry, with a hint of moisture, and is easy to clean and dry."
1,"Again, great till it breaks",Loved this until it broke. Only two years old & the string flew out. I took it apart & there is no visible way to fix it. I looked on line & it said I had to buy a new lid. NO WAY! I paid $30 & now it has to go to a landfill!!? 2 years later! It just looks like it came undone. Shame on you Zyliss!
2,A funny smell that doesn't go away....,"I bought this salad spinner a little over a month ago. It seems to work fine but has a funny moldy smell that has not gone away even after repeated washings in numerous different cleaning products. I've tried liquid dish soap, vinegar, soaking in baking soda and water, all to no avail. I store it uncovered, which takes up more space. Overall, I wish I would have bought a different brand. I can also see that one drop on the floor will break the outer bowl, because it's a rigid plastic. I had a white Copco brand salad spinner that lasted me 15 years. Might go back to that brand if this one gives out or I decide I don't want to put up with the funny smell."
2,Works well but is not durable,"This spinner works very well...but the clear plastic is breakable. Drop it once and you've bought another. This is the reason for the tabs breaking off.Our previous one was made of flexible plastic, with a handle that worked a gear mechanism within the lid. It lasted ten years. I'll be lucky to get a year out of this item.Good functional design, poor choice of materials.Update: less than three years laterIt finally died - no more of the tabs broke off, as I got used to holding the top down firmly. The handle, however, broke in two and my arm flew backward, causing a shoulder injury. I had to go back to my previous model, which lasted over ten years but I ditched it in search of greater capacity."
1,MILDEW ALERT,"This spinner works okay and does its job, and I was delighted with its visual appeal UNTIL THE MILDEW DEVELOPED. :( There is no way to clean between the layers of plastic in the lid. There is mildew in there from trapped water and moisture, and it looks gross. Zyliss should either make an airtight design, or allow users to take it apart for proper cleaning. If you read the other reviews on Amazon, other users have the same problem. I was super lucky and got the mildew. Ewwww! ;)"
3,Gets the water out,"This product does a great job getting the water off the lettuce however, it doesn't keep it any fresher than just leaving it in the bag. I will admit this is the only application I use it for so if you are using it to rinse other things it probably works fine but I am disappointed in the way lettuce turns bad rather quickly. I will say however that it removes the water very easily and clean up is also easy."
1,Loved it when it worked...,"I really loved this salad spinner when it worked. The string, however, was unable to spin the lid and bowl after less than 30 times' use in total. The first time when it failed, it miraculously came back to life the next day, but this time I wasn't so lucky. I wish I could open the lid and find the problem. If it is fixable, I would give it 3-4 stars."
3,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Bought this in Oct 2011 and have been enjoying it since then. Needs lots of spinning and string pulling BUT! Someone pulled the cord too hard tonight (no longer retracts) and I contacted Zyliss to buy a repacement lid. They told me that there is a 5 year warranty and that just for sending them a picture and a description of what happened they will be sending me a new part for free! This is an amazing story, especially if it turns out to be true. I will let you know."
5,Nice Item,"Product works as described. The salad spins around very easily, as the water drains through. Good storage capability."
4,Make Quick Salads For Dinner,This handy device works well to dry lettuce quickly so that now if I decide I get home too tired too cook I can make salad fast. The puul cord makes this work fun too. The only draw back is cleaning the cover. Water gets trapped and takes a while to dry properly. Otehrwise a neat little gadget.
1,Great until it breaks!,"I used this spinner less than 100 times before it broke. The little dingus which keeps the lid and spinner mechanism together is a cheap piece of plastic junk which just dropped off one day. Until then, I would have given this spinner a five star review. BTW, I tried to get Zyliss to live up to their ""lifetime"" warranty to no avail. Stay away from this until the fastener quality is improved."
3,EH,"This spinner does the job, but I've definitely used better ones. The top doesn't stay on very tight and it tends to pull off as you're pulling the string. I'm also not a big fan of the pull-string mechanism. Water likes to get trapped in the space in the lid as well. Overall, not the best. I guess I prefer salad spinners with either a turn crank or a button to push. (but it DOES spin my lettuce...also makes a good lettuce keeper, so can't complain too much!)"
2,shrinkage,"Twin size pad was comfortable. Though first time I washed it, used warm water and put in dryer and pad shrank so much, I could not use it again. Recommend washing in cold water and only putting it in dryer for a couple of minutes."
1,No mention of any anti allergen features or capability on product or packaging,"Although the product description lauds the anti allergen features of this mattress protector, I found no mention of this anywhere on the product or its packaging. Either Amazon's description is a complete fabrication or they sent me the wrong Sealy mattress protector. To spend $40 for a full sized polyester protector without the added benefits to protect against bed mites seems a bit too much."
1,find something better,"I have the queen, and it didn't fit very well the first time, and got worse each additional time I washed it...even though I followed washing instructions.I know it's not waterproof or stainresistant, but I thought I would add that my dog peed on it, and I removed it immediately, but couldn't stop the brand new mattress from staining. The stains didn't come out of the mattress pad either. (Just in case anyone is thinking of putting on a kid's bed)"
1,Does NOT fit california king mattress,"This mattress pad is too small to fully fit over my california king mattress (which is neither an extra thick, nor a pillowtop mattress). The sides of the cover do not come close to stretching over the sides of the mattress, as this type of cover is designed to do. I am very disappointed in the product."
2,Doesn't fit well...,"Don't try to fit this on a water bed ~ which IS California King size, because I use regular CK sheets all the time.... I'm trying to re-sell at eBay right now!"
3,Interesting attack on communism,"The main character's love of architecture (and, in particular, the houses he owns) and his genuine emotional attachement to them might seem odd at first (such as the fact that he gives classic Serbian women's names to them), but, over time, the message becomes clear. Pekic's take on communism: the fact that we should not give up our possesions to share with others, whether they be our human relationships, or, as in this case, material things. To add to this thought provoking theme, the book is also a nicely done chronicle of this century's history of one of the major Balkan cities (Belgrade) ; it is a story often overshadowed by Holocaust memoirs and the like. All in all, this book was a provoking , and , above all, very entertaining (due to its irony) read."
4,Wonderful game - Sierra does it again,"Well Sierra did it again with Trophy Hunting 5. The graphics and gameplay are superb. I went out to buy a different Sierra game (Trophy Bass 4) could no find one and bought this instead. I had a preveous version of Cabellas Hunting and was very dissapointed, took it off my PC in a matter of weeks. This one from Sierra will remain. Also noted on the manual for Trophy Hunting 5 was a promo for Sierra's Trophy Bass 5. So I guess I was lucky I did not get the older version I set out to buy. If you like hunting try this one, it's wonderful............and nothing really dies."
2,lack of game support,"Hello I felt like sticking my 2 cents into this stuff . I bought this game for the online advertising they pasted everywhere and from the bottom of the box in the requirements .Serria hasn't ever bothered sticking a server up for the online play when you log onto the online menu and create your acct they tell you there is no server up and they do not have any ETA to get a server up ,(2 YEARS NOW) no server yet .Game play is real good can't lie and tell you that it isn't and the AI are very intelligent , but from lack of company support and the company lies I wouldn't recommend anyone buy a seirra/vivendi game (These people have lied with every word that has fallen from their lips about their games ) .if you like single player this game is awsome but never count on this game being online ....."
4,"Finding ""Dave Berry""","On the sleeve cover of the ""Very Best of Dave Berry"", Dave mentions playing at the ""Club 60"" in Sheffield in the mid 60's. I was the owner of that club, and Dave used to play for me for $50.00 a gig in those days, always packing the house out, he was along with Joe Cocker, one of the biggest draw cards in the North of England at that time. I was absolutely thrilled to find Dave's CD collection of his 60's hits when browsing the net. For anyone who loves 60's music, this is a must for their collection, the quality and presentation on this album are as good as anything put out today, it has truly stood the test of time. Please pass a message on to Dave, and say its time he put another ""masterpiece"" collection together. Regards from an old friend, Tony Land - ex Club 60 (ps. I wonder if anyone out there remembers the ""Club 60"" in Sheffield)"
4,This is an enjoyable compilation of British 60's pop.,"Since Dave Berry was only popular in the UK and Europe I had never heard of him until I came across his name and some of his available CDs while surfing on-line CD stores. Looking at track listings I was familiar with some of his songs as covers, but I had no idea how he sounded. His Top 5 hit ""The Crying Game"" was included on the soundtrack of the same name, so I sampled it at a CD store. I liked the sound enough to take a chance and buy this CD. I was pleasantly surprised to find the CD an excellent compilation of British sixties pop. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I wish I had learned of Dave Berry years earlier. As a fan of British beat music of '63-'66, I have a growing collection of CDs by many of the UK groups which did not gain popularity in the US. I believe Dave Berry should have. He was as good as, if not better than, many other male vocalists of the time."
5,relevant to continued existence,"the is the only place where the layman can hear the full truth about the impending carastrophe. i for one will expose everyone i can to this film and i beg others to do the same.its obviously too late, but we must try."
2,Big disappointment,"Too much text and too many pictures, not much information that you would not find in most PB books. Part tutorial, part reference, and part practical guide, but nothing special as a whole."
2,Not impressed,"I agree with Mr. Boyes. Having borrowed a copy of this book, I count myself fortunate I didn't pay for it. It is a basic tutorial for novices, without a clue on ""where do we go from here?"". The technical information appears to be a regurgitation of machanics availble from many other sources. Nothing new here...a basic anthology of known methods. I seriously wonder how many of these reviews were written by the author himself?"
5,Very Helpful,"The Definitive DataWindow by Richard Brooks has been very helpful to me. Recently I have been assigned to learn the application and without the opportunity to take classes I found it very challenging. Rik's book has been incredibly helpful to me. It gave me basic concepts and it provided me with detailed instructions on how to execute each command. Not only that, but Rik answers my questions online! He and his book have been very helpful and I look forward to an advaced book."
1,&1.50 was too much to pay for this,I saw this author present at tech wave on this same subject and he was incompetent and totally disorganized. I had hoped he was just having an off day but having picked up this book at a second hand book store I now know that he really is! This book is as poorly put together and thought out as his class was. The material is disorganized and when you find what you are looking for it is incomplete. I think these other reviewers are either friends of the author or work for the publisher because the $1.50 I paid for this book was too much! I sure hope Richard programs better than he writes!
2,Disappointed!,"The book is good if your first starting to learn PowerBuilder, or programming for that matter, but not if you have used PowerBuilder or are a PowerBuilder Developer. Too much of the book is dedicated to how to use the DataWindow painter and what the various controls are and not how to exploit the datawindow itself, the functions, datastores or templates.Entirely too much of the book focuses on normalization and database design....enough already...I wanted DataWindow 'Meat and Potatoes' and got a leftover 'tv dinner' instead!VERY DISAPPOINTED!Can I have my money back?"
1,The book's title is a lie.,"This is a terrible little book. The only good thing about it is the front cover (and that it is mercifully short). This book has little to do with Zen. The majority of the quotes are by people who are not Buddhists or Taoists of any stripe. The quotes themsleves have almost nothing to do with Zen. The quotes tend to be taken out of context and are much too short. The overall effect is to make great thinkers sound like followers of New Age mee krob (that's a South Park reference). The only purpose of this book is to make guests in your home think, ""Oh look, they have a nice pretty little book about Zen. They must be intelligent, enlightened people."" That only works if they don't actually open the book."
1,"typos, typos, typos","This book represents one of the poorest editing jobs I've ever seen. The number of typos, images that don't match content, and outright errors make this book a pain to read. While there is useful info throughout, the poor editing quality is distracting."
1,Awful !!! Thank God I can eat normal food,"I have been reading about the benefits of a gluten free diet recently and saw the Bob's cookie mix on the shelf and gave it a try...As usual I ate a little dough in the mixing process and the taste had me pessimistic .. but what the hay .. let's try it.. Well...They were dry and cooked up very strangely but were cookie-like nonetheless. So down the hatch and the taste and consistency was AWFUL !.. Lesson.. !! If you want to be healthy, eat a piece of fruit! - and have real cookie once in while in moderation.. If you have a gluten problem..eat something else..I am trying to think of how much beer I would have to drink to think these taste good.. a 12 pack at least ! I am serious."
1,worst gluten-free cookies,"I am a cookie lover so was really excited when I found a cookie I could eat! However, the prepared dough from this mix smelled really bad. I didn't even lick the bowl like I usually do. I hoped that the cookies would be good after being baked, but boy was I wrong. They were so bad I couldn't even eat a whole cookie, honestly! If you gluten-free folks haven't yet found the perfect gluten-free cookie, check out the line of cookie mixes from Colie's Cookies ([...]). It's a new business and the products are only available online. I tried the sample pack consisting of 6 different flavors.. and all 6 were super yummy! Even my non-gluten-free friends and family said they were EXCELLENT and couldn't taste the ""gluten-free"" aspect! If you haven't yet tried them, you are in for a real treat!"
2,weird taste,"At first I thoughts it tasted like soy flour was used as it had a similar smell; however, it is garbanzo bean flour???????????? This is the first miss for Bob's. I won't reorder."
5,Yummy,"Such a super tasting cookie! This is a very delicious cookie, just don't over cook it and it is perfectly sweetened!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"I made these cookies today for my daughter who has a gluten allergy and the rest of my family. The kids were so excited to try these and boy...were we disappointed! The substitute for flour in this mixture is garbanzo bean flour. Really? There are so many flour alternatives on the market and they put beans in this recipe. And the dough really does have a bean aftertaste. It starts off sweet and then the lasting effect is garbazo beans. Not what I want in a cookie. To make them better, we added more vanilla and then rolled the cookie dough in sugar. It was the only way to cut the bean flavoring. Also I think they only add 25 chips so be sure and add more to your own recipe. Betty Crocker's gluten free version is so much better!"
3,Gluten free choc chip cookies,"My son was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease. So now were on a quest to find good alternatives to wheat products. A hard job at that. Just baked these cookies today. Be warned DO NOT TASTE THE DOUGH. It tastes awful. Also, do not bake these cookies to be soft. They need to be baked through. You'll understand if you taste the dough. He's nine he'll eat just about anything if it's sweet. I will be trying other brands in the future with 5 stars and better comments."
5,So yummy and so easy!!,"My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, rice, and oats (plus more). It is nearly impossible to find cookies he can eat as almost all wheat free cookie recipes call for rice flour or oats. We were hesitant to try these because the Bob's wheat free brownies are pretty bad, but I'm SO glad we did! These were delicious and free of all of my son's allergens (the chocolate chips contain soy lecithin but his allergist said that does not contain enough soy protein to cause a reaction)! Not to mention so easy to make! It has directions for substituting the egg right on the package, and we used Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Spread instead of butter. I did have to cook them for about 21 minutes instead of just 15 as the package states, but they outside is nice and crisp while the middles are still soft and delicious. I will definitely be buying this mix again!!"
3,OK if you don't mind the bean-flavor,"These cookies are easy to make, and maintain a nice shape during baking. However, the flavor is not so great. Gluten-free baking has come a long way in the last few years, and you can find good recipes and mixes that don't involve bean flours. The bean flour flavor is pervasive and lingers in your mouth long after you eat the cookie. Since we gluten-free eaters are sometimes desperate for baked goods, we tend to overlook slightly off flavors, but this was too much for me. I will not buy the mix again."
5,"Chocolate chip cookies, sans chips","This is a great cookie mix. I have not found a better tasting glutin free cookie mix. Unfortunately, I don't like chocolate chip cookies, so I sift out the chocolate chips and cook my cookies without the chips. They are great.If I knew which Bob's mix was the same w/o the chips, I would buy it instead."
5,Nothing Better,"Agreed. These cookies are amazing. When my non-gluten-free friends come over they ask if we can make these cookies. Plus the fact that they require only 2 ingredients, these cookies are the only ones I will make at my house!"
2,weird after taste,After finding out that my girlfriend needed to eat gluten free we went on a search for a good chocolate chip mix. At first they have a good taste but moments later they leave a weird after taste. This is the first Bobs product I can't recommend. I guess I will just make them from scratch unless I can or someone recommend a brand to me...
2,Looks can be deceiving,"I also had one of those metallic tasting cookie experiences. The dough was a little nasty, but even after baking, they tasted off. You get the ""maybe this is going to make me sick/be bad for me"" feeling that generally accompanies food on its way gone bad. What is that metallic taste?!"
1,Not worth the money,"Unfortunately these chocolate chip cookies were a huge disappointment. The dough does not hold together very well and the taste is overwhelmingly ""ricey"". We won't be buying this mix again."
5,weber 426001,wonderful just what we ordered delivery was great can not wait to use it my hubby does not like to grill in any temp below fourty degrees
5,Great product,"Typical Weber, very good quality, I've had the Genesis for years, I use a Q220 for tailgating and now have purchased this. Great product."
5,great grill,"This grill was easy to put together and it took about 45 minutes. It heats up quickly and lights with a push of a button every time so far, I've had others that were hard to light and had to use a lighter every time. This is perfect for a single person or small family."
5,Weber Q300 Gas Grill,"I bought the grill to replace a larger Weber that came with my husband. I love the grill - it was easy to assemble, its size is perfect for our patio, and I like having two burners. It's everything I expected from a Weber.The only negative I have is that I managed to grab the front of the hot grill rather than the handle. It was a stupid error, but it has certainly made me more cautious about using the handle.There are no ""deals"" on this model because it is fairly new. But Amazon had a free shipping offer, so I feel like I got a bargain. And the grill arrived 48 hours later!"
5,Everyone was right,We've been too busy grilling to post a review.My husband is totally impressed by the quick & even heating and one-click start. I was looking for a smaller profile (have you seen the SIZE of some of these grills???) and non-stainless steel as I've heard they're a pain to clean.We're very pleased and would buy this again in a heartbeat.
4,Weber barbecue,The unit is very stylish and works well. Some parts are ordinary steel like the hinge rods and will rust with time but is almost impossible to find an all stainless barbecue without paying over a $1000 dollars.Mike
5,Delightful product,"This gas grill is delightful. I am horribly mechanically-disfunctional and I put this grill together.Wow! There are 2 of us now and the grill is just the right size, flames- up on a dime, is easier to clean the other models,and is small enough to fit in a corner out of the way. The grill itself gives all the food a marvelous ""gourmet"" char. I love it and have tried many new recipes and with great success."
5,Great Grill,"When I first looked at this grill, I thought that this grill would be too small because it looked so much smaller than the Webers with the large base cabinets. What I have realized is that the cooktop surface area is well proportioned and that the grill holds a lot of food. The cast iron grates leave wonderful line marks in the food and that not much falls through the grates.although the base holding the grill is not fancy, what the base lacks in the WOW factor, the quality of the grill makes up for it. For the price to have stainless steel componenets and cast iron grates, I feel I did very well for the $$Happy grilling to all who read this post!"
4,Great product // Very easy to install,"I have bought this product 1 month ago and I have to say, it is just perfect for my need.It is my first bbq, so without any other experience I cain't compare it to others.I really appreciate the way we can cook the meat , with 2 different pipe (external or center).I recommand it."
5,Great,We have this grill for more than a month now and we love it. It's a great grill for a small patio.
5,Wow! What a BBQ,"I have had the WeberQ 300 for a couple of months and I love it. I debated about getting this product because it is pricey. Now that I have it, it is well worth it. I have a small patio and the unit fits nicely. It was super easy to put together. Even though most of the unit is plastic, it is very sturdy. It has more BTU's than I will ever need. In fact, it has taken some adjustment getting the temperature low enough to avoid burning. I live in Southern California so use my BBQ several times a week all year long. I am looking forward to a long relationship with this grill. Highly recommended!"
5,Best of the best.,"The Weber Q Series is a great series of grills. I had the Q200 and loved it for the RV and camping. When my old grill passed away I immeditarely decided to order the Q300 for the home. It is even greater with the two burners. The porcelain coated cast iron grill is so easy to clean and the heat is so even. The price is a little high, but the quality and performance are certainly there and Amazon's price was the lowest with the free shipping. The only downside was the wheels were left out of the box. Weber got those to me very quickly and registered the grill over the phone. I am very happy with the grill, cover and drip pans."
4,Light and Simple,"Received the grill by 2 day shipping today. Took about 45 min to put it together by myself. Hooked it up and cooked dinner on it. Heats up to 550 F in 10 minutes just as the manual says. It's slightly misleading that it says portable, when they really just mean, it's easy to move around your back deck/yard. The steak and asparagus were perfectly cooked. I'm slightly skeptical that all of the plastic parts will pass the test of time but for now I'm pleased."
3,Beware of fires,The shape of the grill has a tendancy to trap grease. Last week we got to experience having the fire department put our grill out. Be careful and do not place on a deck.
3,BWG,"Grill is nice, had problem with burners clogging up, also grates are very hard to clean and keep from sticking even when wiped down with oil before use. Would not purchase this grill again."
5,Weber Q 300 BBQ,"Box beat up from shipping,but very well packed-no harm done! Took about 45 minutes to assemble. The igniter didn't work,but a call to Weber customer service had a new one on the way--recieved new igniter about 1 week later,now I have the BEST BBQ I've ever owned!!! Get the Weber cover,fits great,keeps bugs and debris out of it very well A++++++"
4,good little grill!,"Cooks like a champ,perfect for single guy,like me.Impressed by the even heating,unlike cheap grills...I'm smelling a faint gas odor when I cut on the tank,but have't taken time to track it down,yet.Also,only starts on the small burner,not the large as instructed...oh,well...used it about 10 times,with great results."
4,Weber Q 300 grill,The unit was dropped off at our doorstep by UPS with the package obviously damaged as it had been dropped somehow and the corner crushed. We opened the box to inspect and found that part of the handle had been broken. We called AMAZON and they arranged for a pick-up by UPS but we had to repack and re tape the box WHAT A PAIN ! Amazon did reship and we got the replacement unit a few days later ..opretty easy to assemble
3,I bought the E-310 instead,"This grill may be suitable for one person, a couple or small family. It will handle basic grilling well for a while. I decided to go with the Genesis E-310 instead. Why? The warranty for this grill's plastic parts and aluminum shell is only 5 years and 2 years for its paint. And the rest of the parts 2 years. Because there are no flavorizer bars covering the stainless steel burners they only have the 2 year warranty.The Genesis had a 10 year warranty on its burners. It has 25 years warranty on the cast aluminum and porcelain-enamel shroud. Also the Genesis allows a rotisserie to be added. Indirect heating is a bonus with 3 controlled burners too. That was enough for me. However, if you don't do a lot of grilling the Q300 may be just what you are looking for on your condo's small balcony. It all comes down to the function and necessity. I hope I have helped someone."
3,"Serious, are you really?","And now a review from the Gurrrlz. **UPDATE*08/2011*** Im docking 2 stars from my first review, as you should not have to offer fixes for this. Portable, if you mean around your yard, ok, I wouldnt take this to the park or beach. Porcelan coated grates, I have my doubts. A rotisserie- not even. Beer can chicken youll have to play with. Smoking roasts, and chicken thats on you to figure out. If you wanted a sophisticated BBQ this aint it, if you just want to cook steaks, burgers, sausages, pre-cooked ribs and chicken, and roast veggies, this is a perfect BBQ. For this ammount of money I would have expected more, but this is what I bought, so I have learned to live with it. So for everything this BBQ lacks, its back to my charcoal Weber."
3,Don't be shocked,"Okay I admit I haven't used this grill yet but I do want to let everyone who is considering this purchase know that other than the parts that ABSOLUTELY have to be metal this grill is ALL PLASTIC. I am replacing a ten year old metal and wood Weber (which now by my own admission I probably should have tried to fix!). I fear for the safety of this grill in a strong wind storm due to how light it is! Oh well, maybe my neighbors will enjoy it!"
2,A grill with no racks and one burner? COME ON!,"First off there are no racks in the grill, so you have to heat up buns on the grill itself? Then are you going to cook everything at the same temperature? No place else to put kabobs and corn except on the grilling surface. If you are cooking a lot ofone thing it is great. Not so great if you're cooking for a family with different needs and wants."
4,Review of the Grill,"The grill that I purchased is fantastic. It was easy to assemble, it cooks evenly, it is easy to opperate, and the style hides the unattractive propane tank, so it is asthetically pleasing. It did arrive, however, with a small plastic piece broken off of it. This may have been the result of careless shipping or faulty merchandise. From my experience with delivery packages, I would confirm it was due to carless shipping."
1,Non-existent Customer support,"I bought this for $30 and less than a week later, I see it is $24. I can definitely see why they dropped the price. I have sent several questions to Tech Service with no response. I sent a question to Sales and got a single line response and a FAX form to upgrade for $49. The electronic help is rudimentary at best. The program is a few versions old and has many bugs. I would not recommend this to anyone. They do not list a phone number for support and did not respond to my request for one. They used to win awards for a good product but this seems to have stopped around 2007. I think they are just milking it for suckers like me."
1,Peter's Rabbit Maintenance Formula,"Neither one of my rabbits like this food! I didn't even care for the way it smelled! If rabbits do not like the way something smells , they will not eat it!!!!!"
5,great for pain,"I was having serve pain in my right hip and was told I had degeneation in the spin causing the hip to become painful climing stairs and sometimes walking. I started the MSM and within a few days, it was as if nothing was there. I could walk and climb the stairs with almost no problem."
4,outstanding lyrics and rhythms!!,A very pleasant surprise for those new to African salsa...very well known band from Senegal and popular in the New York City latin salsa clubs. These guys will make you want to get dancing and moving to smooth salsa beats!!
4,Worked fine for me,"They shipped as expected. I ordered 2 coils for my old 1969 Johnson 25. My old ones did not check out with the ohms meter. These were a good replacement. Fit fine. Just had a little difference where the plug wire goes into the receiver on the coil. Didn't affect the results at all. So far, a good product for a decent price. AND, my motor runs like new."
3,PRO-CYCLE TACHOMETER,"ITEM WAS RECEIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION, COMMUNICATIONS WAS GREAT, PROBLEM IN DELIVERY BUT SITUATION WAS CORRECTED. AUTOMETER TACHOMETER IS VERY DURABLE AND LOOKS GREAT WITH THE COBALT BLUE BACKLIGHT"
2,Dog allergy,I gave this to my 70lb dog twice a day for two weeks and it did not stop itching. Not sure if it helps humans but definitely did not help my dog.
5,I use this for my cat.,I just started using this for one of my cats who has really bad allergies. I have been spending lots of money on vet visits and all they seem to do is prescribe antibiotics even after telling them about all of the sneezing she does. She just got done with zithromax after 3 weeks and she still sneezes and seems to have a lot of phlegm that she coughs up and swallows. I found this on Amazon and started using it. I had a syringe left over from when I have her antibiotics and I just cut half of the pill and crush it up and mix it with water. She seems to tolerate it well. I have only used it one day so far. We'll see how it works. I will update this with her progress.
1,Heed Side Effects Warnings!,"This medication did absolutely nothing for my dog's allergies and skin itchiness/inflammation but did give him dry mouth and diarrhea. He's a 58-lb pitbull and I gave him two 4mg tablets at night (I was worried about lethargy so I opted for a bedtime dosage). He didn't poop at all the next day, and didn't poop (or drop a puddle, frankly) until the following evening (that's TWO DAYS!). He also whined and cried and was often sitting in the ""sphinx"" position (indicating his cramping and discomfort) and he drank more water than his usual intake. I basically had to let him out every hour or so. Obviously I stopped after 2 days of the medication and the diarrhea stopped in about 18 hours or so.In all fairness, the side effects are clearly listed, I just want to encourage other pet owners to take them seriously. Now we're on a soap-free veterinarian-prescribed shampoo and good old-fashioned Benadryl."
3,Works for the most part,"This seems to help our dog's allergys, but not completely make them go away. Maybe her allergies are just worst then most."
3,works ight,"not the best but worth the price! only last for a hour or 2, got it for my dog- helps a bit"
4,It works.,I have tried other products but they did not do much if any for my dog. I can see the difference in his behavor.
4,Allergy relief for Irish Wolfhound,"A friend recommended this medication for dogs with allergies. It has calmed our Irish Wolfhound and saved his skin - thanks! But I was surprised to see it advertised as a dog med and the bottle was a people med.???Anyway, it worked without $100's in tests. Great!"
5,ggreat,Great product! My dog had really bad hives and they cleared up quickly. Nothing else worked. Quick delivery and the price is right!
4,Best allergy relief for my dog!,"My dog has terrible allergies, especially in the Spring. When she broke out with the hives, the vet gave me antibiotics and Chlorpheniramine 4mg tablets. She seems to respond to this antihistimine better than any of the others I've tried. 20 tablets cost me around $15 from the vet. I found them here, and 100 tablets cost me just over $8 delivered. OH HAPPY DAY! I received my order within a few days, boxed, and in a tamper proof bottle. If you're having trouble finding relief for your dog, I recommend trying these pills. 1 tablet twice a day for my 40lb dog. Also, I just received another product that has been highly recommended by a local dog rescue to help dogs with allergies...The Missing Link Canine/Feline Well Blend. They were singing its praises, so I'm jumping on board! Hope this helps, and good luck!"
4,2beagles,"Bought this to help relieve my dogs allergies,Had her on steriods that work for a short time then give up, 1/2 pill of this Med. every other day works really good,and is a lot cheaper than the Vets Meds"
2,Pills,The product was as advertised. Bought it for my cat that sneezes constantly. Did not work for him. He still has respiratory problem.
2,Maybe the dose is to small?,"My dog is allergic to the world, I picked these up to help. They didn't do anything. Not even when I was giving him six per the docs recommendations. I'll stick to benadryl."
5,Very Good! Buy This Book!,"This is an *excellent* book! It's a coming-of-age novel, combining very good character development, a well-developed science fiction device, Man-vs-Nature adventure, ecological ethics, and a rousing dose of good-American-boy vs. evil-Government-agents. As in Steven Gould's first novel, Jumper, issues of alcoholism are examined in a sensitive manner.If you are an aviation buff, you will want to read this book. If you are a Heinlein fan, you will want to read this book. If you live in Texas, you will want to read this book. If you were ever an American teenager, you will want to read this book. Get the picture? :-)"
4,Smart Fantasy !,This is an intelligently written fantasy with an innovative plot. The characters are well developed and the interplay among them enough to keep me interested in their own stories minus the fantasy aspects. The narrator is a likable hero and come through smarter than his age. The only complaint I have is too much descriptive technical jargon which tends to slow down the pace of the story. A few times I just skiped how a certain object is built or how a plane is flew! More effort could have been invested in the wildside itself and the characters. A pity!
4,a door to another world,"I would say that this book is aimed at late teen readers. However, the author writes well enough that it is also entertaining for adults.When Charlie Newell discovers a door in his barn that leads to another, pristine world, where humans never evolved, he puts a plan together. In order to finance his plan he sells some carrier pigeons (extinct birds) to some zoos. Things get tricky and very risky from there.The author has created very sensible and intelligent characters in this book. Despite the fact that the major characters are just out of high school they they act in many ways with more sense than many 'grown up' people.The only thing that ocassionaly lets this book down is the author's love of describing 'gadgets' and processes, which can make the prose a bit dry at times.Worth a read if you like 'reality' based fantasy-adventure novels."
5,Great read,"Really enjoyed this, lots of detail without getting bogged down. Moves along well and really drew me in to the story, you won't be disapointed with the read."
4,Way Better Than My Expectations,"This really surpassed my expectations. I mean, it was marketed as a young adults' book, but I thought the concept sounded fun. I was in for a pleasant surprise when I found a real page turner with great characters and a really interesting storyline.Don't let the cover art fool you, this book is a lot more cerebral than two kids being attacked by a mammoth, sabre tooth tigers and a helicopter. In fact, the charm of this book is that there are no Ridley Scott-type theatrics and ""our heroes in peril"" situations.Steven Gould may spend too much time on very detailed descriptions of various contraptions rigged by our hero Charlie, but once I skimmed through them, I was really happy with this book.One final note, as an aviation enthusiast, I loved all the flying."
3,Great concept but too much description of logistics.,"The main weakness of the book was its endless detailing of building sheds and wiring and purchasing equipment, etc. Relatively little time is spent in the wilderness on the other side. It was, however, well written."
5,Adventure & Coming of Age,"Yet another book by Gould that delivers! He's one of my favorite authors. It's exhilerating to join the main character as he discovers a link to another world, and really comes into his own as an independent young adult and entrepreneur. All four main characters bring a very realistic human element to the story, and at times I found myself even more interested in their interactions than the ""business"" at hand. But perhaps that's just me... ""Wildside"" is a great adventure story, sure to make you wish YOU had your own link to an alternate universe! Since you don't (am I wrong?), the book is the next best thing."
1,German schlager music,"I neer heard a musiclike this. and i don't want to listen to it anmore. a typical German schlager music. very cheesy and happy. listen to it if you have a lots of bear, a fat girl by your side and lots of bacon to drum up it all. satisfaction guaranteed:)"
3,Perfectly Servicable,"These do just what you need them to. They are sturdy, seal well, and can fit most average sized paperbacks or small hardcovers. However, and this is a big point, it WILL NOT HOLD INK from a sharpie. Your address will smudge, even a day after writing it. You'll need to use a basic ballpoint pen."
5,Poly Mailers the Answer to Rough Handling,"Because shipments packed in paper bubble-wrap envelopes frequently are torn and content damaged during postal system's processing and delivery, I decided to try these poly bubble mailers to ship items to my customers. I have been greatly pleased. No more damaged shipments and customer complaints. If the item is fragile (DVD, CD, thin paperback, etc.) simply reinforce with stiff cardboard for extra protection. Poly bubble mailers are difficult to tear and they keep content clean and dry. They have a slight flexibility for inserting a tight fitting object and are light in weight."
3,Very Lightweight Mailers,"I find that these mailers while being very lightweight are not as protective in some ways. The bubbles can be popped with little pressure and for books, they give little rigidity to the package like a manilla paper envelope does. You take some risk that for possibly saving 17 cents in shipping your item is more likely to get folded over. The plastic IS more puncture proof though."
1,pretty chintzy,"I find I have to double these up when I send a book in the mail, which of course dips into the savings I thought I was getting by buying them in bulk. They're pretty thin and not substantial enough to trust on their own."
3,"Kinda cheap, but got the job done for now.","We bought these when we ran out of our normal supplier. A pretty lightweight envelope. Cheaper than our normal envelope, but we'll go back to it since it's more sturdy than this one."
4,Usual great Weber quality,"Weber 9933 Premium Q Cover Fits The Q 300Very good cover, holding up well outdoors on our porch. Only knock is it has turned somewhat brown, losing its black luster. Maybe it's collecting dust, maybe it's fading, I don't know. However, it does its job well and is holding up fine."
5,Premium Q Cover,This is a great solidly made cover. A strap was sewn on the top for ease of pulling the cover off from the grill. A winner!
5,"Great Grill Cover for the Weber ""Q""","This is a great custom grill cover for the Weber ""Q"" Model Gas Grill. The material is firm but flexible to slip on & off with ease. Mine is not tight fitting (as some reviews note) but, rather, has just a enough play to make putting it on no problem at all - - - and the top handle really makes it easy to pull off. No need for any draw string, as far as I'm concerned. Due to the fit, (and maybe more particularly the style, because the grill side trays do have to be down to slip on the cover), is just right to keep the grill covered, even with wind. I like it!"
4,tight fitting cover,"Well I like the cover, but I it is hard to put on. I hoped that it would slip over the grill easily. It does not, it is a tight fit. The quality of the cover is excellent. I just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier."
4,COVER THIS,"I purchased this cover for my Q300 and it fit's nicely but loosely. I can't say it fit's like a clove as another reviewer says, because I have hardly ever been able to put a glove on as easily.I was a bit disappointed that the product feature column which listed a front draw string and elastic band to draw it closed is mis-information. At least my cover does not have those features. None the less, I think it's an ok item to do the job of keeping it out of the weather and elements. Since I've never had a grill cover, my only question is how many spiders (black widows) will find a new home inside of it?"
4,perfect fot the Q,"This is a great cover. The ONLY thing is that if the side trays are up, the cover will not fit. I have to put them up and down."
4,Tight fit,Good quality contruction. Just be aware that you must lower the two side tables each time you put the cover back on for the night. The tight fit does make the cover less at risk of blowing off on a windy day.
5,perfect!,"This cover fits the Q 300 like a glove. It is heavy-duty, waterproof, and extremely well-made. This is a much better cover than some of the cheap one-size-fits-all covers that are out there. If you want to keep your Q 300 in excellent condition, then spend the extra money and get this cover.4/12/2009 - I took the cover off after it's second winter in New England, and the grill was in excellent condition! I had it on the grill through this past winter of multiple snowstorms, so I have to say this thing does it's job! Highly recommended if you want to protect your Weber Grill!"
3,Be wary of some reviews,"I have not purchased this item but I was interested in it. Review from T. Jones makes me wonder if this person is the patent owner that you find in government patents under patent number 7,231,030 submitted by Clifton T. Jones. The patent is relative to devices like you are looking at today. One thing is for sure, the concept of this product is great. I am a little skeptical at spending in the ""C"" note category for a product that doesn't have a lot of good PR."
5,It Works.,"It's metal, not plastic, looks good and works.Very inexpensive with two wires to connect and two screws to attachI believe that says it all."
3,Good as a supplement,"This is a good product overall if you already know the alphabet, as the previous reviewer said. It also helps to know basic words so that stringing them together is easier. I would recommend this video only as a supplement to other basic materials because there are several typos throughout. I have found misspellings that are obvious if you're playing close attention and some other mistakes where the wrong word appears on the screen, though the pronunciation is correct. So be careful not to base your Russian on this product alone! Having said that, I borrowed it from my local library and don't regret it."
1,Did Not Worked,"When i got the product, it wasn't the one i had order, it was old model, and it didn't work, other than that, i received, the product 2 days after i order it, shipping was fast, and even getting the RMA number was a breese, In And Out computer, representative was really nice, like i said to bad the product did not work."
3,Sangean Review #1,"The radio produces good quality sound despite its small size. The controls are a little strange, there being but one knob-button on the radio itself. The remote is pretty straight forward with controls for sound, tuning, on-off, and a host of other features I have not yet used."
1,Poor performance,"I do not recommend the Sangean HDR-1 radio. The clock does not keep time. It loses about 5 minutes a month. The reception is terrible. This $200+ radio cannot receive stations that the radio it replaced, a $15 Sony cube, could. The controls are poor. The remote is very cheap. The radio does not show the time if the radio is on. I was not enamored with the looks, but compromised because I thought it was a good radio."
5,A Great HD Radio,"This table top radio perfectly fit my needs. The sound quality is great and the volume is sufficient for a large room. It even makes nice background music for a large party. Even the non-HD radio signals sound rich. It will not replace a 500W stereo system, so have real expectations. The telescoping antenna unscrews from the back and you can attach a roof-mounted FM antenna. I live about 60 miles SW of Chicago and this radio finally allows me to pick up my favorite stations without static. I am using a Winegard HD8200U antenna to improve reception and both were worth the money. The one con I see is that there is no battery backup to keep the clock and station presets during power outages."
2,Single point of failure,"Unfortunately, I can't recall dates and times, but I purchased this item as my first venture into HD radio from Amazon (at about $250). I was very pleased, being about 35/40 miles north of Denver. I received the few NPR stations that I used to listen to plus more (the text of the program, music cut, etc). Granted, I was not interested in CD quality music, and so cannot comment on that - I was interested in picking up some of the frequency/monetarily/politically shifting things going on here in Colorado. After about a year, the front LED(?) display quit working. Everything, tuning, display, re-programming depends on this display. Now all that visibility is gone. Everything that I programmed before still works just fine as before but I guess trying to re-program anything with a non-functioning display may be possible but is too challenging for me. I am, maybe foolishly ordering another HD unit (this time from Sony)."
2,Sony HD radio is better,"This radio is ok and it sounds fine. It is kind of a pain that you have to do most things with the remote. Once you get use to using the remote it works fine. But if I ever loose the remote, the only thing I will be able to listen to on the radio will be FM. I also have a the Sony HD radio, it is head and shoulders above this radio, but it does cost about double what I paid for this radio. The reason I got this radio is because it was on sale on Amazon for $114. And it works fine, but the Sony HD radio blows this one away in every way."
1,Power surges fried four of these,"I originally bought two and found them lovely. They produced wonderful sound. Within a year a transformer in the neighborhood exploded and the radios no longer worked--no lights came on, nothing. Sangean exchanged them for two new ones. They produced wonderful sound etc. Within four years another transformer explosion and again both radios no longer work, even though i had them on heavy duty surge protectors. And I believe Sangean no longer makes them."
1,Over priced and under performing,I was really disappointed when I found how few stations I could bring in even with their antenna's attached. I was equally disappointed that the control of the radio was primarily from the remote. My previous $30 Sony actually worked better!
4,does everything promised,"i bought this because i wanted a clock radio that gets hd fm stations. the radio picks up all the local hd stations and the sound is fine for a small radio. Not the fault of the radio, there are many more stations on the internet. The manual gets you through all the programming. It is kind of like programming an old vcr. Once you get the hang of it, there's no problem. So the pluses are: it does what it says it will and does it well. The only minor issues I have are that you need to look at the display nearly head on and HD radio is limited. But i wanted an HD radio and i'm very happy with this one"
1,It loses the time and its settings if it loses power.,I purchased this as a HD Radio Alarm Clock Radio. I returned it for credit since it lost it's settings and lost the time if it lost power.
1,"DON'T BUY THIS, IT HAS QUALITY PROBLEMS","You'd think a radio this expensive would have better QC, but it has bad quality problems...mine was erratic on its set-up parameters, losing some, locking up on others. And it doesn't even hold the time a few minutes after a brief power interruption. Sheesh, even the cheapest 10 buck clock radio can do that! Buyer beware."
2,Not what I had in mind,I bought this cookie cutter thinking it would be big enough to make cookies on a stick. I was very disappointed at the small size of the cutter. Normally I would use one cookie per skewer but because the cookies are so small I would have to use at least three cookies per stick to make it look decent. This product in my opinion is only worth 99 cents.
3,Vivabeat mp3 album,"This is a great album. I would actually rate the CD version higher than the mp3 version due to Amazon's inability to encode mp3 files well. Also, there's noticable tape hiss and you'll probably want to remove it with your favorite audio enhancing software. The music itself is fun 80's new wave. It's really a shame this band didn't become more well known. My personal favorite from this album is ""What We Talk About (When We Talk About Love)."""
1,Not for movies,This product works great for kid's DVD like Seasme Street or Thomas. When we try the Avia on movies the picture fades. The sound disappears. On the whole a bad buy.
4,Bring it on,"I never have heard of this before. I was listening to it expecting nothing. It is a semi-folk record. It is mostly a one-man band. That man is named Hrishikesh Hirway. It is sometimes a very intimate record. Songs like ""Under Thunder and Gale"" and ""Drowsy Haze"" set the mood of the album, which is very sadcore. Some other songs use more electronic elements. It's much more at times like Xiu Xiu or Arab Strap. Most of album is composed of songs about uncomfortable states. The One AM Radio is all about saying things without saying them. It is worthwhile but understated. They are touring a lot this year and it's interesting to see what they will be like."
4,sounds great on vinyl,"I saw these guys at Koo's in downtown Long Beach the other night. They absolutely took my breath away. Very intimate, beautiful music. As the name suggests, it sounds great late at night. Reminds me a little of the soundtracks to Lost in Translation and Solaris."
3,hmmm...not sure,"hmm not sure,i know this product cointain controversial hydroquinone ingriedient, but i do think its a great bleaching agent. if you are scared to use it do your research! I found that it was only tested on rats and they fed them with the hydroquinone..well a lot of staff we eat is cancerous. I know it goes to your bloodstream so dont use it when you are pregnant. My only problem with this product was that after few days of using it left me with dry patches all over, i was really really dry. did see a slight difference (slight cause it was short time)Stop using it and switch to Ambi we will see how it goes. also the smell of the product was kind of intense.texture was light and you dont need much so i belive its going to last a long time since the jar is pretty big.hope that helpsloveJ."
2,Esoterica Fade Cream,"I bought this item from a retail store a while back after reading online reviews. Many people had good things to say about it, so I figured I'd try it. I used it on my face in hopes of fading some dark spots. I used it twice a day for a month and never saw a noticeable change. I don't know if it's just my skin type or what, but this product has not worked for me at all. Now I have moved on to another product, hoping I will find the cheap and easy solution. I can only hope!! :)"
3,Works,"Ok so it really does work, but the smell, in my opinion, stinks! It gives me a head ache!!! I would return it but throw away receipt... Ugh"
2,Only ordered and Used it once...,"It didn't work quick enough for me, so I moved on to another product. You can stick with it and see if it works.I prefer Ambi cream."
1,PLEASE READ B4 PURCHASING,"THIS CONTAINS hydroquinone, WHICH CAN AND WILL GIVE YOU CANCER. ITS ALL OVER THE INTERNET IF YOU GOOGLE IT IT SAYS TO STAY AWAY FROM ANY PRODUCTS THAT HAVE THIS CHEMICAL IN IT. IT IS ILLEGAL IN THE US AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE AND SELL THIS ITEM SO IM NOT EVEN SURE HOW THEY ARE SELLING IT ON HERE. BUT IF YOU GOOLE ESOSTERICA IT WILL SHOW YOU THE INGREDIENTS AND hydroquinone IS IN FACT IN THIS CREAM. IT IS NOT SAFE! BECAREFULL IF YOU DO END UP BEING FOOLISH ENOUGH TO TRY THIS."
3,Hustling Huskies,"DVD does not capture true feeling of achievement though eyes of players and coaches. Season game to game action is a bit tedious with it's sameness. Relate it to an ESPN highlight segment. Not very well done, although hardcore Husky fans may find it of some interest."
1,Dogzilla,"This dog costume must have been designed to fit a dog that has no neck! I bought it for my pom. and it fit his body fine, but the hood part didn't even come close to reaching his head. I also bought this same costume, same brand and everything for my golden retriever and the hood part didn't fit either. I was very disappointed by this product!"
3,The Strangler,"Though I loved Defending Jacob by William Landay, I wasn't nearly as dazzled with The Strangler. The storyline was not as developed as I would have liked it to be. The potential was there for a great book, but fell short...in my opinion. More development of characters, more action, and greater detail would vastly improve this novel. I liked the book; I didn't love it."
2,The Strangler,This book contains a number of characters that at times proves confusing to follow. The book tries to cover several plots simultaneously and can discouage the reader from investing more time. I found the book to be slow reading and disappointing after having read Defending Jacob.
2,not so good,After reading defending jacob which was amazing i bought the strangler and found myself uninterested with the stories going on. I wouldnt recommend reading this book.
2,Disappointing,"I read Defending Jacob first. I was expecting an engaging story with this Landay novel. However I lost interest about half way through but read on and then skimmed the last 30 pages. I wanted one of the Daley brothers to emerge as a hero or at least an anti-hero, but no. All the rest of the characters were just as flat and unlikeable. The violence didn't add anything to the story."
3,Not his best,"I bought this one after really enjoying Defending Jacob. But the pacing on this one wasn't as compelling. I'm struggling to get through it. Good author, just not his best on this one."
2,Okay...,Plot interesting but went off in too many directions. Characters were not well defined. Couldn't relate to any one of them. Didn't finish....
3,None,"This was not a good book. It was terribly profane, just for the sake of profanity. The story line has been hashed ane rehasahed enough. I am very glad I read his 3rd book and then his 1st book before I read this one or i would have never read them. That would have been a shame. His 3rd book, Defending Jacob was very, very good. don't miss it."
3,The Strangler,The StranglerIt's well written but all the characters are losers. The story is a real downer. An imcmplete ending relative to the outcome of some of the characters
4,Boston at its worst,An entertaining tale set in Boston in the 50's. It is a story that kept my interest to the end.
4,Good quaity,The Canon LP1019 camera bag is of super quality and holds my Canon EF 75-300 lens very snugly. I'm traveling to Australia and need to protect my lens and this is perfect for my needs. Great price compared to my local camera shop. It arrive exactly on the max. day noted for delivery.
4,Good option for heavy lenses.,When people spend a lot of mony on camera lenses it is good to keep them protected either in a pouch or carrying case. I gave this as gift and it was received with great joy.
4,Bayonet style lens hood users take note,"Remember, this pouch does not take into account you're using bayonet style lens hoods..The diameter is to small..Otherwise it's a pretty nice professional looking pouch.."
4,Excellent recording,"Goetz's charnming version of The Taming of the Shrew held the stage in Germany for much of the 19th century. It is a tuneful, engaging score similar in style to Nicolai's singspiel version of The Merry Wives of Windsor.This opera used to be only available in a 1944 radio broadcast issued on Urania records and recently available on CD from Preiser. This version on Gala is a 1955 broadcast in much better sound with superior conducting from Keilberth and a superior cast headed by the great basso Gottlob Frick who was also featured on the the 1944 recording.At Gala's bargain price, it is a steal. No libretto unfortunately, but decent notes and synopsis."
4,Life just got sweeter,"Real nice CD to add to my ""paradise"" collection. Great voices, a little jazzier than the others."
2,made to rust,"This is a decent antenna and I purchased two, however the spring base developes rust and if you don't get rid of the rust it will discolor the spring and may look strange."
2,If your a fan...,"As previously stated in other comments,this is a re-issue of 2 previous documentaries. I didn't know this when I pre-ordered it. I feel ripped off a bit. Though, the DVD's are great, if you don't own them already. The "" Hounds of Love"" analysis is especially well-done. I agree with the other reviewer...that in the wake of the slight re-emergence of Kate Bush, I expected something extra than a re-hash...however, this is not authorized by Kate Bush...so it is what it is. Oh well...."
5,classic!,This is one of their most ambitious albums in their career. Unfortunately it's hard to come by but if you ever do come across it I'd strongly suggest you buy it!Anyone who's into hearing latin goth music with a great female vocalist will enjoy this very much!
4,TwinTown....Yeah!,"I believe this film is superior to the one it was often compared to- Trainspotting. For some reason this movie was billed as the Welsh version of Trainspotting when only on a superficial level do they share anything in common. This movie is my kind of family values, as they get serious in avenging their family's death against the fascist bullyboy rugby magnate. Buy this film, it gets better every time, and buy the soundtrack because of Catatonia and SFA( Rock on!)"
4,MySQL and JavaBeans,".... Connecting from a different machine is covered just fine in the book. A simple matter of the URL and port 3306.The book was a great help in configuring MySQL in a J2EE environment. This is easily the best book out at this time. Looks like some other references are coming soon which may turn out to be better. However, as of this writing, I couldn't have succeeded with the JavaBean config without Core MySQL."
5,Easy and quick to understand; needs real examples,"It is very good at covering the ""core"" of MySQL and gives an introduction to relational databases in general (the relational model, SQL, normalization, etc.).My personal opinion is that Atkinson should have assumed the reader was already familiar with the relational model and spent more book space on MySQL. Atkinson's info on relational databases is decent but lacks depth and takes away space that could be used to give real examples of the uses of MySQL.I'm giving this book a five star because I feel the other reviewers were unfair."
1,Absolutely the worst technical book I own,"I own at least 25 current technical books written in the last 3 years, and i have to say this one is the very worst ever published. The entire layout and approach reads like a pontificating madman who lacks the ability to ever gets to the point or dares to give an example. Where subjects should give a brief description, and an example, the author ramblings on in paragraph form bolding every other key phrase and usually leaves you more confused than you started WITHOUT an example. I am fluent in SQL and have been an internet engineer since 1996, and this book still wasted my time. If you need to learn MySQL, most definitely buy a book at Amazon.com, just don't buy this one."
1,Missing vital basic information,"The author seems to think that you'll always be connecting to MySQL from the same machine it is running on because he gives no clue how to connect from another machine. This is a question that comes up over and over again on the MySQL mailing list - without any answers. I hoped to find the answer in this book, but he didn't address the issue.The index also seems to only have the first couple of entries for the words indexed."
1,worthless battery article,The article was less than 1 page and was just general info. Article was over a decade old and did not have current technology. Did not have any usefull chemistry..
4,Excellent acting by Johnny Ferro,"Excellent acting by Johnny Ferro as ""Johnny Roberts"", the directing could have been better as there were parts of the story line that didn't transition smoothly and missed opportunities to add more tension where it needed most for the story to have more drama and intensity. I would have appreciated a different ending but I appreciated the story's spiritual undertones nevertheless. Johnny's character was sweet and intriguing, and made you want to know more about him. ""Romeo's"" character played by Stephen Tyrone Williams, was likeable as he worked through his inner conflicts and tension with his family and friends Again, some better directing would have helped develop this character better. Overall, I gave it 4 stars as I enjoyed the movie very much."
4,Very worthwile movie,This is a really good movie-- a compelling story line and great characters. I thought the acting was very good and the cinematagraphy was beautiful to look at. Definitely worth the time it took to watch.
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"I don't know about the 5 star rating given in 2005. This piece of junk is nothing but trouble. Drivers fail to load, apps freeze. There is little to no documentation. No FAQs available on driver conflicts or on how to avoid them. Search the internet and you will find more than a few frustrated people trying to resolve problem after problem. A simple query to Leadtek was never answered. Even their uninstall app for the driver froze the machine.BTW my PC is new and in good shape. You want to capture video? Use something else."
2,Audio/Video Sync Nightmares,"Easy to set up and use. The video capture also is of high quality. But any attempt to edit the video for DVD burning fails with sync problems. If you just want to watch TV/videos on your PC this is pricey but OK. If you want to burn the results to DVD, avoid !"
4,Sunshade for the Ute,Covercraft sunshade are not made like your flimsy cardboard shades. Covercraft are made to the exact specifications to your vehicle. Provides great UV protection and keeps the vehicle cool.
1,Pretty pointless,"This book meandered a lot. On and on about boring, boring details that never mattered. When something did happen, it was confusing and poorly described. The birth of the baby was disgusting and disturbing. I'm never reading anything by this author ever again, that is how bad this book was."
3,"Good, but","This was a thoughtful and interesting book, but there were some major flaws, too. With a good editor, it could have been five stars. First, there is a ridiculous, anatomically impossible pregnancy that seems to have been thrown in for fun, and second, the last third of the book drags on and on with needless complications that do not serve the plot. Worth a read if you like sci fi, as it has all the good *and* bad points of the genre. Not for the general reader."
4,Nice little rug,"The picture used for this item differs from the actual item - I like the actual item much better as the bat is not a separate protrustion, but is actual more central in the rug. The rug completes our club usa theme in baby's room. Yes, you can use it as a wall hanging, but I prefer using it as a rug. With a little care, the rug cleans up well and is well made."
3,"For all the praise on the bookjacket, I was underwhelmed.","I guess Dembo's concept of regret applies here. After reading glowing comments by Peter Bernstein and Steve Ross, I was really excited to read the book. I finished it wanting more.The book does make some very good conceptual points - specifically that risk management should be forward looking and not backward looking. But the hype for REGRET is overblown. After bashing economic theory, the authors present Expected Upside Value - constant*(Maximum probable loss) as a decision metric. Hmmmm, let's see, if the constant is greater than one this is essentially a simplified utility function. Smells like economic decision theory to me....For the mathematically inclined, the book is a quick read and worth a quick look. For the non-mathematical manager the concepts are definitely worth reading and thinking about. Nothing earth-shattering, but better than most."
1,Even worse than his prior book,"I read this book hoping to find an improvement on the Rules of Risk. Sadly disappointing. Its filled with technical errors and claims of discovery of great truths on areas already commonly understood. When I discovered technical issues in the book I turned down a corner of the page. 87 pages were marked when I finished. This book is a unique combination of badly written, frequently incorrect and restatements of the obvious. I strongly recommend not wasting your time and money."
4,Excellent!,"A methodical and quantitative treatment of risk (as opposed to uncertainty). The Sweet Regret chapter, alone, is worth the price of the book. An insightful and pleasant read, almost a surprise discovery. A future reference. I recommend the book to all serious investors who wish to approach their investments more objectively. Don't expect it to be another book on how to make big profits with the stock market, though."
2,Nothing New; For Beginners Only,"This book is a loose collection of highly watered-down ideas from standard portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In order to appear more original the authors have renamed conventional concepts like reward and risk to ""Upside"" and ""Regret"". Their technique which they call ""marking-to-future"" is the same process that forms an integral part of the binomial and trinomial lattice methods which have been used in the financial community for many years. The authors have also introduced a term which they call ""lambda"" to represent an investor's degree of aversion to risk, which is represented by the curvature of the investor's utility function in conventional economic theory. The book contains a number of numerical errors, particularly in the examples. For those comfortable with calculus a much more comprehensive yet still readable book is ""The Risk Management Process"" by C. L. Culp."
3,Good enough for a fieldguide,"Good illustrations, a couple of sentences about ecology per species. Broad topic, small book, does what it can."
2,Too much padding for me.,"I love Harbinger gloves, just not these ones. It's a personal preference. They are excellently made, but my complaint lies in the rubber pads on the palm.When I'm lifting, I like to ""feel"" the grip and the weight. These pads just put too much distance between me and the weight. They're too thick.If this glove was the same thing but with the traditional leather pad as opposed to the big rubber tires they got on these, they'd be excellent.If you are a casual lifter who's not really into it, you probably won't have issues with it, like I said, it's well made.But if you are lifting heavy weights and/or a gym rat, you know what I mean when I say you want to feel the weights."
4,Pretty Good,This is a good product. I have had some other gloves from another company and they're not even on the same level as these gloves. I have ordered some more gloves from the company. I'm currently deployed in Iraq so when I get some free time then I put my Big Grip Wrist Wrap Gloves to work. I can't wait to get back to states and use my new ones. This is a great product and I would recommend these gloves to anyone that is currently or thinking about working out.
2,Padding is too solid and does not conform to clenched fist well.,Padding is too solid and does not conform to clenched fist well. Works well only if you lift very heavy so that the weight forces the gloves to conform to you hand. I'll use this for lifting very heavy weight and use another for light weights.
2,Only if you can get going with them,"As others have mentioned, in the initial phase the leather padding will be too stiff and intrusive. I got them yesterday, put them on and the fit was OK. Just that I was not able to close my fist properly as the hard padding was digging into my flesh.As others have said, it may subside and become softer/more comfortable after few days, I dont have patience for all that and have returned them."
2,Bad smell,"I've been using harbinger since mid-90's and all of them share the same problem: after a few months the begin to smell like wet rag, a recurring odor after handwash, machinewash, sun exposure. I am embarassed to use them. This particular model is in its second year of use at first, they seemed too bulky to completely clench your fist without some feeling of vascular obstruction an effect exacerbated by the rubber pieces that form the non-slippery grip; sometimes i prefered to use my basic pair without all that fancy stuff. Now that some rubber has fallen they feel better. As of now they are dismembering at the seams, they still smell bad (3-4 working sessions a week, <2 hours, good care). I am moving to another brand hopping they will behave better maybe GoFit or Valeo or Nike. Try neoprene perhaps?"
4,Very durable gloves,"These are great gloves for really heavy lifters. I would buy them again. One downer is that the rubber pads on the fingers don't quite allow for your grip to be closed far enough. I'm a size large and these fit great, but they do pinch my index fingers with curls and pull ups. I thought they would break in, but it's the design of the pads. Other than that, I really do like them."
4,Well built,"These gloves are extremely high quality. They do a great job of protecting your hands, and for most exercises, they do help your grip. The have the best wrist support of any glove I've used to date. However, as mentioned: if you have small hands, the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts, chin ups, etc. Also, the material inside is a bit like felt. When your hands are sweaty, these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. They may just need to be broken in more, but I've used them for 3 weeks thus far."
5,Great hand held grater!!,"I love this grater, it is convenient, and cleans up quickly. It goes through hard and soft cheese in no time."
2,Better off with other washable paints,"This is a good idea, but doesn't work well in practice. First of all, they are very hard to squeeze out for small hands. My 3yr old cannot do it. Second, they seem to get clogged, so when you squeeze, the paint ends up squirting out near the cap (the brush cap), not the brush. And when there is only a small amount left, but still some usable paint, that doesn't squeeze out. We had to take the brush cap off, and dip our paintbrush right into it.We have both the glitter and non-glitter ones. I threw out the glitter ones. They may say washable, but they don't wash off the kids hands easy, because its very sticky. You have to almost peel it off using your own hands. The regular kind washes off fine.I have other kids washable paints, and washable watercolor paints, for them that are much easier to use."
4,Precise View of Madison,"Recent scholarship has revealed a much more consistent 'Madison' than some historians have granted 'The Father of the Constitution'.Scholars Rosen, Banning, and Rakove have lead the way in this regard. Reads contribution although brief is as Rakove pointed out a deft work.By highlighting the concerns Madison held about the excresent powers of the Continental Congress, amidst the environment where the Congress was frustrated from performing the assigned tasks, revitalizes and reinforces the devotion Madison held for Constituional integrity reconciling the thoughts and actions of Madison in the 1780s, to the 1790s. It is only wished this essay could be expanded, and that the author could apply a more expanded study on Madison's contributions."
2,STILL NEED TO SHOP AROUND,Received the batteries in a very short time but no where in the add does it state that these batteries are dry and no acid is provided. I must now shop around for battery acid or return the batteries at my expense. When I called customer service they explained that the maintenance free batteries come with acid but no where is that mentioned in their add....the gentleman just apologized for the inconvenience and hung up.
4,Great for Homeschooling,"This is an excellent elective addition to our homeschooling. Well writen, clear and intereesting."
5,A must for anyone interested in Calligraphy as a business!,"This is an excellent book for those starting in the Calligraphy business. It is well written, easy to read and has many fine illustrations. The author has written a book that caters to the artist. He knows that a lot of artists have a hard time with sales and are often very critical of themselves. His philosophy is to jump in and start working with easier projects and you will gain experience and clients as you go. There are many helpful tecniques I haven't found in other calligraphy books, such as how to address envelopes, the proper way to fill in certificates, and what to do if you have made a mistake! A small book packed with extremely useful information. Note, this book does not include instructions on letter forms and basic calligraphy, you will need to refer to other books for that."
5,Definitive,The voice from the man who actually lived the experience. This is eye-witness history so the reader gets the real picture.
4,stranger than fiction?,have been a hornblower fan for over half a century and read a few of obriens novels. thought them all good yarns. then this. the real thing. i never expected someone to match the action in the novels. read the intro and stop reading when the lawsuit starts imo. until the lawsuit is is like all the hornblowers packed into one real life. amazed me.
2,Chatty exposition with no active plot development,"This story is all chatty exposition via dialogue interspersed with occasional kidnappings, beatings and hospitalizations. Characters say: ""I did this, and then he said that and then I went there and came back here. . . ."" and on and on and on.All exposition with very few real ""situations"" or plot turns. Occasionally, the descriptions of Venice life are entertaining."
1,Definitely Not one of Leon's Best,"I had discovered Donna Leon only recently and most of the books Ihave read I have really enjoyed. However this one I simply could notget into. It seemed long, drawn out and boring to me. The violentattack on Brett twice was just too much and too graphic. I think oneof the problems in our country today is TV and authors believe thatwe will not buy their merchandise unless there is loads of violenceand sex in them With Leon, it,s the violence. I agree that most ofher books do not have that much graphic violence in them but this oneand one other have. It is sad it has to be in there as the maincharacters are drawn up beautifully; Brunetti and his lovingfamily and his care for the underdog. This book really consistedmore of Flavia and Brett-to me it just got tiresome."
2,Doesn't quite work,"For me this book didn't work. I found myself skipping bits and getting bored. The author tries, but does not succeed, to merge the daily life of her characters with the tension of the crime story. None of the characters quite come to life. Brunetti seems bland. I will not read any other books by this author in this series"
2,Lacked interest,There was really not enough here to hold my interest. I don't mind a gay couple's portrait but why harp on and on about it? Their were not enough IDEAS in this book. Just a plodding story line. Only read about 1/2 and then skipped to the end to see how Leon put this out of it's misery.
1,Don't bother,Melodrama with little redemption. Bad guys too ridiculous and unbelievable. How can anyone sneak anything into China? Ridiculous and poorly thought out. Waste of time from an author who has done a lot better
3,Not quite a winner but worth the read,"Brunetti ventures into the art world in this story and the city and its flooding become one of the characters - even more so than usual. One or two of the plot devices used to explain the unfolding of the forgery are not too satisfactory, but if you're a Brunetti fan you'll forgive him a lot. Not quite a winner but worth the read."
4,Poorly proof read version of a fine author,My review refers to the Kindle edition which contains quite a few copy errors. I assume the publisher did NOT in fact proof this copy. At the price they should do a better job. This is a well written series that makes me want to visit Venice.
5,Venice with Donna Leon,My world-wide traveling is now done by reading a good mystery set in a distant location. Donna Leon is the perfect introduction to Venice and to life in that part of the world.
4,Grows on you,"At first, this book seemed to me to be trite, full of little aphorisms and such. By the time I reached the end, I finally understood the underlying message. As with our personal relationships, what counts in our daily living ARE the little things. The author presents this insight with a gentle hand that matches the mood of the message. Thank you, John Izzo, wherever you are."
4,Intriguing,This book was interesting how it came from so many people's view but all tied in together. A good cooperative writing.
2,boring,"I try to finish a book once I start it, but the first chapter of this book completely turned me off. There was nothing exciting going on, the story was a over the top...I am glad it was a freebie"
4,"Mossy Creek -- a fun read, great characters","I recently finished the Kindle version of this novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not serious literature, but it never waivers in the entertainment it provides. The chapters are all stand-alone novellas, but are intertwined in a clever way so as to make the whole much better than the individual parts. The author skillfully changes the narrators throughout to give insight into characters that earlier appeared to be simply minor characters. This was one of those books that is hard to put down for the sheer pleasure one feels from reading a well-written, entertaining novel."
3,It's OK,"I started reading this book and got half way through and stopped, I just didn't like Miss Ida. I found her to be so manipulative, I don't like people like her in real life and I don't want to read about people like her especially since she is being glorified. If she was a man, she would be the bad guy, but since she is a woman, she is being considered as eccentric. I did like the stories that she wasn't in. I found them to be very quaint and fun."
4,Fairly Good Read,That's about it! Isn't it ridiculous how you have to enter a minmum amount of words to give a product review. Makes you not want to leave a review.
4,Interesting formula,"I found this book to be interesting because when I began reading it, I thought it would be a combined anthology of stories that all fed off of one another and created a book as a whole that flowed together. Instead, I felt the writing was really good and the stories alone were pretty solid, but as for combining them, they would not make much sense. When the book is titled with one single title and all of the stories must conform to fit under that one title, I just felt they should have connected together easier. I struggled with giving this book a three or four star and eventually decided on four, as it was a fine example of writing, even if it was a little confusing. I think if you are to pick up this book knowing that the stories do not link together like connect the dots, then you will most likely enjoy this book."
3,Mossy Creek,I have not had an opportunity to finish reading this book. I have laughed and enjoyed the very real characters who have reminded me of many people I have known in the South where I have lived for most of my life. I read four books per week if possible and watch very little TV. With the holidays I have been busy and feel that I can not honestly say at this point exactly what I think of Mossy Point.
4,Billythekid,"I am enjoying the Mossy Creek series. I love to read about the south and the people that make up the south so this is right up my alley. This series is a good, easy read."
4,Friends and Family,This book reminds me of Fannie Flagg and Pat Conroy books in that you move into the book and get to know the characters. It's not about exciting or action it is about the characters and caring about them. I plan to move into the next one.
5,Mossy Creek is a wonderful place to visit!,"I am not usually a fan of short stories, but this book was different. Each story is character sketch and many of the characters make guest appearances in other stories. This is truly fiction, all the characters are big-hearted people who trul y love their town and each other. I loved Mossy Creek and also couldn't decide story I liked the best"
2,Not an attention grabber,"""A delightful new collection of original Southern stories""Collection is right... a bunch of short stores that confused me and didn't seem to flow together. You would end a chapter but the next would be a totally different story, a different person telling the story and whatnot. It was hard to follow though I was able to finish the book."
2,The book ends right in the middle,"A bit disjointed but I was interested enough in the book to finish it; however, it will be the last one I read by this author. It ends right in the middle and you are told to read the next book. A huge disappointment."
2,Interesting concept,"While I think the multiple authors had an interesting idea to create a story about a small town by each creating one of the colorful town characters, it might not be the best read. Personally I found it boring, and am not sure why I continued to read to the end. I simply do not care enough to continue with this series and find out what happens to these characters and their town."
4,Great Small Town Read,"I just finished reading Mossy Creek, and thought is was hilarious. This is just an uplifting book with so many different characters and intertwined stories. It makes for an interesting read, at times laugh out loud hilarious, but also with some serious life lessons. Would recomeend it a great weekend or beach day read."
1,Too unbelievable to keep reading,"A Southern matriarch/mayor feuds with her governor nephew.Another story that lost me at the beginning. The mayor is sentenced by an obviously prejudiced judge but doesn't appeal it. I can suspend some disbelief but this was so blatant I couldn't ignore it. Also, I have suffered enough injustice from the courts in real life that I don't enjoy reading about it in fiction."
3,Great little guide,"This is an outstanding little field guide that can be used by children, but which doesn't talk down to children in the slightest.I'm picturing a young beach-goer who has taken an interest in seashells. Many children like to pick up the shells they see, but what do they mean? Where do they come from? How does one associate them with the animals that used to live in them?This book will provide the answers to these questions, and do it in a way that will foment a lifelong interest in scientific study. It demonstrates that when you want to get something out of a book, you have to put a little something into the book, but it falls short of being difficult or frustrating.The color illustrations are very well-done, capturing both the indentification points and the beauty of these amazing creatures."
4,Swashing,"Overall this is a fine product. It works well and the setup was easy. There are two small issues: 1)There is one detection mechanism (which allows the seat to function; it is triggered by weight). It is under the left leg. You must adjust the seat so it is in contact or the seat won't work. 2) There is no ""battery is low"" indicator on the remote. When the battery is out the seat will not function.These were two problems I encountered on set up. It was frustrating, but once I figured them out the seat has worked flawlessly."
5,As advertised,"Seemed worth the money and arrived promptly. Am trying to go wheat free, so this was part of a medley of alternatives I ordered."
3,it's ok,I thought I could stick this on my rear window of my truck but the sticky side is on the back not front. otherwise the product is fine.
4,I ordered a chain; I got a chain,I ordered a replacement chain and it came very quickly. It was in a brown mailing envelope with no additional information or packaging--just the chain which I thought was a little odd. No way to tell whether it was new or a sharpened used blade. It fits on the saw and cuts wood just fine.
4,A solid early effort from OSC,"This is one of Card's earliest efforts and, at times, it shows. His maturity of style and characterization is missing. But the stories are extremely imaginative. It is not hard to see how he built up such a loyal following of science fiction fans."
1,"Cheap,Cheap,Cheap.","Poor product all around.Thin glass that dosn't fit the mounting fixtures,insecure mounting system. Nylon screws that tighten on glass strip out,ect."
4,NGK Wires for my 99 Civic Si,"Car has 188k miles and is the second time i have decided to go w/NGK wires. Along w/new plugs, my car runs alot smoother and better gas mileage. Amazon had the lowest prices for the plugs/wires."
3,Browse a copy first,"As others have noted, the designs here are a bit dated, that's not always a horrible thing. But, there are many newer designs available with contemporary building methods that might be more suitable for beginning homebuilders. It is a good deal for plans for 16 plans, but the truth is that building any boat, even the simplest dinghy, is a pretty good investment in time and money --- so if you are not willing to pony up for the price of plans, you may not be ready to build a boat to begin with. Not saying that these plans aren't good, just that you shouldn't get this book soley for the ""bargain"".Take a look, if there is a design in here that moves you, then it's worth it, but there is not much in the way of instructional information that is not better handled by other books, and there are a wealth of more contemporary designs for stitch and glue, sheathed-strip, or glued lapstrake construction, that will probably be better for most people looking to build their first boat"
2,Wrong specs,"Based on the product description that listed the frequency response of this driver at 100 - 20000 Hertz, I bought two of these drivers. I built little cabinets for them and tried them out on my home theater receiver. It sounded rather mediocre, so I got suspicious and did a little research. The actual frequency response of these drivers as listed in Parts Expresses' catalog is 63 - 12000 Hertz. The price is right but be aware that the product description is erroneous before purchasing."
4,A pleasing installment.,"""Boston Jane: The Claim"" is the third ""Boston Jane"" book in this series, and while it's not as adventurous as the other two, ""Boston Jane: An Adventure"" and ""Boston Jane: Wilderness Days,"" it gives off a familiarity, with new problems. Even though Jane can handle grizzly bears and men, she shows weakness to her female peer that is definitely realistic. I was disappointed in her friends for befriending Sally so quickly, and discarding Jane hastily, but the ending is satisfactory. Hopefully, we won't have to wait two-years for a fourth installment, like we had to before. I good read - I recommend."
3,Not the best for last,"I really enjoyed this series. However I feel it went downhill a bit at the end. I strongly agree with a previous review that stated it was hard to believe how weak Jane was in this book. She was a very strong character in the first two books which made those books much more enjoyable for me. I found myself skimming chapters because I was just so annoyed at the lack of backbone Jane had. She couldn't stand up to a childhood bully. Overall it's a must read in the serious, but it did not compare to the first two. I did however very much enjoy the ending."
3,Not quite as good,"I was expecting much more from Jennifer Holm when I recieved this book. I totally enjoyed the first two, but this one just didn't keep up with them. I think Jane lost her spunk in this last book. She just wasn't as fiesty, and almost boring. Jehu was hardly ever talked about, or made any appearances.Above all....this wasn't HORRIBLE ,and an alright quick read (I finished it in one night). I just wish it would have been more exciting.(...)"
2,dissapointed:(,"This book wasn't even half as good as the first two! In fact it was quite annoying! Im sally shows up again? And williams back? I thought it was a bit sad that holm had too bring back old villians instead of makeing up someone new and interesting. And Janes ""friends"" are quite a dissapointment as wel. None of them stick up for her and jehu is a horrible rotter in this book! He barely comes in except to disbelieve her and be annoying. And there is barely any romance! All and all it wasnt the worst book i've ever read but it certainly wasnt the greatest."
2,Terrible production,I have eight or nine Malmsteen albums and this on is my least favorite. It sounds like it was done on a four track. Obviously the guitar work is excellent but between the muddy sounds and the singer's voice it just doesn't hold up. I would recommend Seventh Sign or any of the first five albums before this if you want to get a better sense of Yngwie's talent.
1,pathetic!!!!,the production is really bad on this album! yngwie must have been thinking too much about his looooooooong boring guitar solos that he forgot everything else! the song writing lacks all good elements! worst of all his albums!
1,What the F---?,"Yngwie is more than talented. The guy can play. Period. And he's even written a good song or two in the past (Soldier Without Faith, Blackstar), but this album is unforgiveable! There might be some genuinely good songs on this album, but I can't tell! The production is so headache inducing that I haven't actually made it through the whole thing in one sitting yet. I've had to break it up so as to let my migraines subside before continuing. How could Malmsteen put his name on something so amateurish and poorly executed? Nothing AND I MEAN NOTHING should ever be lobbed at an unexpecting public if it has production quality like this! Unforgivable, unlistenable, unacceptable, yet wholly understandable, since it seems Malmsteen has been working toward something this bad for several years now."
4,The most explosive guitar but...,"I've listened all discography of Yngwie Malmsteen, personally I hate when the ""magazines"" said: obviously had to be M. Voals the singer, the best who Yngwie ever had! I think the best vocalist is Jeff S. Sotto, for example you can star to buy MARCHING OUT or INSPIRATION (tracks 1,3,6). Even with this vocalist, this is the most explosive guitar album."
1,Disasterous...,"Guys who like Malm's Alchemy, do not read further. But ones who like malmsteen's earlier albums and wonder what has happened to him, since Concerto Suite, will find these lines familiar. First of all, the bad musical perspective in the Alchemy continues. Speed without emotion and musicality was malmsteen's biggest drawback since Rising Force album, but somehow most pieces were listenable. In alchemy and w.t.e.a.w, you can't resume listening after several seconds of a track. It is very bad to say this but, he even made Pagannini's caprice a disaster with his playing... Yuck!!"
1,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen!","My God, what a disappointing album this was. Now we find out what an album produced and engineered by Yngwie sounds like, without the objectivity of a good producer to keep him from hanging himself. As much as I hate to say it, this garage-quality recording is poor even by Shrapnel standards.If you can get past the poor lyrics, poor sound and just plain shock value, there is some phenomenal soloing here - but does Yngwie need to prove himself anymore? We know already!"
3,WHAT'S UP YNGWIE,"I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE OTHER COMMENTS,THE PRODUCTION WAS TERRIBLE.YNGWIE IS STILL THE BEST,BUT THE OTHER FACETS OF THE BAND NEED TO BE OVERHAULED.ORIGINAL YNGWIE IS MUCH BETTER WITH MR.SOTO AS THE SINGER AND THE JOHANSON BROTHERS I HOPE I SPELLED IT RIGHT.ANYWAY THE FACT THAT YNGWIE CONSTANLTY CHANGES BAND MEMBERS DOESN'T HELP EITHER"
3,a reviewer from canton massachusetts,"people say; it sounds like the same old stuff and the guitar is weak.''well you cant get crunching guitar from a stratocaster'' but the chizzled frettboard of his guitar sounds better than those other la.guitarists.what made yngwie so popular in the 80's is that he blended acoustic guitar with metal,and was supposed to be a sort of paganini prodogy,complete with finger tapping,as well as other kinds of interesting guitar stylings,most common in la.another thing that sepperated him from most is that he,even with his english accent was supposed to be swedish.although andy laroque was and is as talented as yngwie really is from sweden lives there and records most of the king diamond tracks there.no one has ever heard yngwie speak swedish.the problem is most don't get the joke.im a viking,heathens from the north etc......from someone from florida.your's truely someone really from the north.........."
1,Time for a change,"I bought this CD and had the luxury of listening to it over a 4 hour car ride. Here is why you are better off spending your money elsewhere:1) Same solos as always only more out-of-time 2) Does Yngwie practice or is he just filling holes in the songs? 3) Yngwie's claim in the 80's was he listened to classical musians. He must have lost his hearing 4) His playing sounds sloppy although it is hard to tell because of the ... production (Yngwie produced the CD) 5) What's next? How about spending more time crafting logical solos instead of writing stupid lyrics.I saw Yngwie on the War tour in Pittsburgh before he fired his band. It was my fifth Malmsteen concert and by far his worst. There were no new amazing guitar licks but rather, sloppy playing of the ones he repeats almost every song. This CD is the same - a poor repeat performance."
3,HUGE!,"This monitor is nice but it is SOOOOO much bigger than the picture and description make it seem. Very bulky and heavy. The screen itself is 17"" but the monitor is much larger. I wanted just a small monitor as a second monitor for my macbook 13""...not really what I was expecting."
1,It sucks,"it had crappy resolution, then, it stopped working out of nowhere and hasn't worked since. get the apple cinema display."
4,Back Cover Description,"A Heart, a home... a husband?All her life, the only place that represented the loving home Melanie Visser always yearned for was a stately, gingerbread Victorian in the town she grew up in. Moving back home, Melanie discovers that her dream house is for sale. And though the long-neglected manor needs some loving care, its embittered owner needs God's healing touch-- and Melanie's kindness-- even more.Widowed Adam Engler can't wait to be rid of the crumbling Victorian. Haunting memories lurk in every dusty corner-- including the memory of his young wife's tragic death. But with the help of Melanie and his young daughter, Adam slowly begins to see that the house could be HIS dream home... but only with Melanie by his side..."
2,juvenile style of writing,"This author's style of writing is totally different from the books she wrote for Guidepost in the GRACE CHAPEL HILL series. I was surprised and disappointed to find that it was more of a ""beginning writing class"" mode. I much prefer the stories she wrote for Grace Chapel Hill and will not be wasting my time on this series from Steeple Hill. The story line was okay, but nothing to hold my interest. A couple of twists at the end were so obvious that its hard to believe an adult wrote this as a book for adults, I'm sad to have to say. This is the only book published by Steeple Hill that I've had the opportunity to read but if this is an example of what they specialize in, it will be my last book from that company."
1,don't try it,"This is single worst product I have ever bought. It is NOT 26 but 18 ounce, top and bottom halves join poorly, and it often does not even make espresso, but spits coffee spots loudly around the stovetop while creating half a teaspoon of mud in its handsome top."
1,Very DANGEROUS coffee maker!,"This espresso maker is very poorly (or cheaply!) designed, causing a severe danger to any users. The threads for the screw-on top are not secure. With the build up of internal pressure from the boiling water, the top half of the espresso maker blew right off, spewing boiling water/coffee everywhere. So much for the pressure release safety valve. Had I been anywhere near the stove at the time, I would have been rushed to the emergency room. I've been using stovetop espresso pots for years so I'm quite familiar with proper usage. It wasn't due to user negligence. Just to be sure, it was tested again with the top screwed on as tightly as possible. And, yet again, it blew off. Luckily, I held a tall stockpot over it and was able to contain the blast, but only seconds before it happened. This product should be taken off of the market, it is by no means safe to use."
1,I wish I could give it less than zero stars,"DO NOT BUY THIS ESPRESSO MAKER!!!. It may look stylish, but it has such bad functionality. When I used this, and did EXACTLY what the directions told me to do, the whole thing was a disaster. When I made it the first time, it was not even brewed correctly, not even to pass for regular coffee. The second time I used it, it boiled over, making a mess of my stove and leaked while it was brewing. AND, it is too hot to hold it by the handle after you're done.THIS IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! I returned it the next day, getting that nightmare of an espresso maker far away from me."
1,Don't bother!,"When the handle on our old traditional cast aluminum stove top espresso maker broke we thought this would be a good replacement. Stainless steel, dishwasher safe, nice looks. All of those are true. Unfortunately it takes the strength of Hercules to get the top on tight enough so it doesn't spit out the sides. When you get that done it spits coffee out the top and makes a mess out of the entire top of the stovetop.I did manage to get one decent pot of coffee out of it however. What I did differently I don't know. Screwing the top on as tight as humanly possible and not packing in the espresso grounds seem to help. The old one was still better (and cheaper)."
2,Ok But too small for me,This is good but it was too small for me. The pic they show makes it look way bigger than it really is
4,Good Book,"Pretty good for a new skydiver, i haven't finished the book yet, but there is a ton of info in this. I ALWAYS run anything i learn or read by my jump master and would recommend you do too before changing any of your emergency steps.buy the book, you'll be happy you did!RonAFF #5"
5,Inspirational Book,This is an awesome book! I really enjoyed reading it for the first time years ago and I re-read it every time in need some inspiration. I have bought this book as gifts for several family members and friends and I highly recommend it.
5,amazing,I am really enjoying this book learning a lot and growing at the same time. This is one you will definately want to purchase to help you open up to Holy Spirit and be free to paint and not be so critical of yourself or your work..we are all gifted in varies ways..you are beautiful the way he made you your art will not look like everyone else's because God made you unique..you are not a clone but an artist. Even a stick figure is art.
2,It seemed rather evangelical to me.,"I usually like books with an element of spirituality, but I wasn't expecting an explicitly sectarian viewpoint. As a non-Christian, I'm having trouble getting past the first couple of chapters. I wish someone had mentioned that this is a very Christian book with a very Christian message. No criticism of her path implied, just pointing out that it is not my path.w."
5,Creative Call a Great Adventure,"I was looking for a book that would encourage me to move forward on my creative journey. I love to journal and make paper crafts (including handmade books and cards), but I've never really seen myself as an artist. I was also looking for a Christian tool, because the philosophy is so different. This book is perfect!I'm enjoying the exercises and I'm reminded that God created us in His own image. He is the Creator and I am a co-creator (imagine that). This book is helping me with my daily devotions and I'm moving forward with more artistic pursuits.For those who are looking for a way to improve their relationship with God, and find out how God wants to create through you, this book is immensely useful. It includes scripture and thought provoking exercises. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
5,My Creative Call,I grabbed up The Creative Call in the midst of artistic anxiety. I earnestly read and did the assignments. Some of the assignments reaffirmed what I already knew but I had not been taking action. I am thankful for Janice's words encouraging me to stay on task. There are other parts of the book which required me to do some deep spiritual digging.Then some people call it synchronicity others know the touch of God's hand as people came into my path and events started to emerge. To my joy a group began doing the book on a weekly basis. We share and discover more. The memorization verses spring up as we immerse ourselves in His word. I came to such an epiphany and will continue to follow the guidelines in the book. I had always believed in the Lord working through my hands but now I see my work as a form of worship. I have passed on my enthusiasm and belief to everyone at Gallery523. Wishing you a good journey too.
4,Getting to know me,I have been enjoying this book. It has helped me to reconnect with the God given gifts that I had forgotten about. I like it because it is not just a straight read. You are encouraged to take you time and reflect or take action. I am discovering a sense of purpose.
2,Not as good as a Remington Rotary Shaver,First thing you should know is that it needs to recharged every other day and the charge indicator doesn't work. The second thing is that it is too big and bulky for travel. It does a fairly decent shave once you get use to it. But I prefer a rotary 3 floating heads type of shaver for a closer and neater shave around the neck. I bought this simply for the price and curiosity of a foil type shaver. Oh well.
3,First oscilating electric after rotaries all my life,"I bought this because it was on sale, for a backup, and a chance to try a ""decent"" oscillating/foil electric razor.These just don't compare to the rotaries. I started out with a Norelco rotary as a teen, have owned another Philips/Norelco rotary, and currently own a Remington three head rotary.Whether you shave every day, or have a longer beard, this just doesn't compare to any of the above three. It is not as close, *even with dull blades on my current rotary*, takes a long time to mow down any left over longer hairs-- having to go over and over to catch them just right.Next purchase, I'm back to a rotary. I believe the Norelco/Philips is the best brand. Remington rotary batteries have had a much shorter charge life."
4,So far - So Good,"This is replacing a Remington DA-407 that I had for 10+ years. The DA-407 was simple, inexpensive initial purchase and replacement foils), cordless and corded use and manufactured by an American owned company. The f720 was the closest replacement I could find.This was the first day I used the product but I was eager to post a review and my review is based on comparing it to my old DA-407.This unit is very lightweight and simple to use and gave me a very close shave. It met my two most important requirements 1) American owned company 2) cordless/corded use.Pros: American owned company, cordless/corded use, power indicator, rinses clean with water.Cons: manufactured offshore (China), replacement foils are more expensive and more difficult to find"
5,So far so good. Best electric shaver I've used.,This is the closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver. I have been using a Braun but I decided they were getting a bit too high in price and lower in quality when I looked for a replacement.
2,Give me no roses,"After being into Warp label artists for a long time, this album was the first grave disappointment for me. This is a very inconsistent and weird collection of sketches and snips that doesn't stand up to such great electronic listening albums as ""Bytes"", ""Spanners"", and ""Parallel"". It's an interesting idea, running in the same vein as Brian Eno's ""Music for films I-III"" series, but it comes out very boring. Not a complete failure, but concerning Black Dog's stunning discography, this album is barely more than filler."
2,eno would not be proud,this album is pretty damn silly. first off - if your going to link yourself to Eno whether it's a joke or not (i really can't tell) then you better deliver the goods. the pieces are generally short (like eno's music for films) but they usually don't go anywhere and certainly don't leave you wanting more. there are a couple of decent moments worth wading through some garbage to get to but this CD will soon be at my local used CD store. maybe it'll be worthwhile for someone if they cough up $5. oh - there are a couple of tablets on the back jacket (maybe Sumerian?) that are interesting - much like the album though they don't seem to serve any purpose.
3,Stories need a little help but pictures tip top,"I must say I was astonished to see how remarkably well Vipah was able to reproduce the artwork of the late H. A. Rey. Too bad they couldn't quite come up to par with the stories all the time. Case in point, My three year old was confused as to why the chocolates started going faster, since the text doesn't point out that george steps on a lever to make it go faster, you have to see it in the picture. Three year olds don't know anything about levers marked EXTRA FAST.One great thing about these new series of books is they are mercifully short. The classic george books check in at 48-64 pages which gets really tiresome after 30 or 40 readings!!I personally think the pancakes book is better. But Chris loves George so it doesn't matter much what I think. :-)"
2,not good,"My daughter got tired of this book while reading it. If you're looking for a book about a chocolate factory, then this is it. If however you're looking for a fun book about a mischievous monkey, then this is not it."
3,"From the golly gee years, lightweight but enjoyable","Okay, this was one of those B movies...an add on at the flickers. No deep thoughts, but like a merengue--delicious for what it is."
1,"A Thousand Names for ""I am so Fabulous""","Someone gave me this book on CD and I have to pull over sometimes to the side of the road it has me laughing so hard -- not because I am experiencing joy and rushes of insights but because I can't believe what is coming out of this woman's mouth. The whole 6 CD set can be summed up thus: OMG -- I am so fabulous! I don't believe for one moment that Bryon Katie has not had a negative thought since 1987 -- pleeezzze! The content of her material is from Course in Miracles and The Work is very similar to Ken Keyes -- always good to be reminded of deep wisdom -- however, the narrative and Katie's stories are brimming with ego -- though she says over and over again that she doesn't have a story -- hilarious! I guess people still drink this kind of ""I am enlightened"" Kool-aid. When the Dalai Lama was asked if he is enlightened,he giggled and exclaimed absolutely not -- ah, that's true humility -- the spirituality of humanness."
5,thoughts,Byron Katie gives insight as to how to change your thoughts and find peace about everything in life.
4,A Great Companion to the Book,"Being a ""kinesthetic learner,"" it's been nice to have this audiobook as a companion to the book A Thousand Names for Joy. I feel that I am absorbing the truth of this book and of the Tao more deeply as a result of both reading and listening."
2,Ego trip,"This is what happens when an author has a super successful book. They lose touch with communicating from a place of genuineness. They let their ego overtake them. That's what happened here. Trying to take the simple and complicate it. Trying to take a unique position to be marketable. If you think about it the whole idea is ridiculous. Instead of embracing the gambit of emotions that consitute the human experience, Katie advocates/distorts acceptance as joy."
2,Not right for everyone,"My book group chose this book so I wasn't sure what to expect. I have not read any of her other books but have read alot of other self-help books and have done some reading about eastern philosophy. This book was annoying! I don't know if I didn't enjoy it because I hadn't read any of her other books or because I already had an understanding of what she calls ""The work"" from studying eastern philosophy. There were paragraphs here and there that I liked but most of it felt like the same thing over and over again."
5,Meet The Queen of Unconditional Love ~g~,"By far the BEST book I have read on the power of unconditional love in its purest form ... where you come away with the feeling of profound freedom and peace after doing The Work.In order to see things change, you have to change the way you see things. And this book delivers! Once you put the info into practice, all heaven breaks loose. ~g~"
2,This and loving as is...,"I read both the books and giving a collective review - the work works no doubt as questioning gives answers which are RELATIVELY true.I personally found both the books disturbing low of energy and a lot of gloom.Secondly the author keeps herself in a high point of reference and 'bestows' her observation to 'these' people. How interesting ? And i did read her chapter about humility!Save your money, just my opinion."
1,Disturbing interpretation of Buddhism and Taoism,"When I saw Stephan Mitchell's name as a co-author, I expected a wise work on spirituality. Byron Katie only used parts of his translation of the Tao te Ching as chapter headings.Byron Katie's message is that all events are joyous. To think this way would be to have no empathy and no compassion for others. The ""accepting of what is"" in Taoism is not a message of ""joy""."
5,Great entertainment,The film is charming. It is tragic and funny at the same time. The griots' chanting is magic as is Senegal.
2,doggie costume,The picture makes the costume look better than what it is. It is poorly made because it does not fit the dog properly. the neck is too short and the little hat/hood cant stay up and the supposed dragon tail is way too short. My dog is only 3lbs and it was still to big for the costume
5,5 Stars from a Germ Freak Parent,"This is a great book to help prevent you and your family from getting sick. When I brought my premature twins home from the hospital I was told it was very important to keep them from getting sick that first year because they were at such a high risk for contracting RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) which can be fatal. This book helped keep the germs away. Despite the unpleasant subject, it is a fun read. The author is really funny.Dr. Jenn Bermanwww.DoctorJenn.comAuthor ofThe A to Z Guide to Raising Happy, Confident Kids"
4,Serious Topic With a Light Approach,"With concern about a possible flu pandemic in our future, the tips in this book seem worth the effort. I know I've been coughing and sneezing for a month since my last airplane flight. Maybe with the preventive methods in this book, I could avoid such a miserable result.I knocked off a star because I really just wanted the facts and not some cutesy comments and a list of celebrities who are germ freaks."
3,Better then the First,"This is better then the first book, Something's Cooking, in that she does attempt to develop Angie a bit more. Unfortunately, this book and the next, Cooking Up Trouble, is probably the best Angie is going to get: after this she just gets downright annoying because she can't see past her own viewpoint. In this one though, you can somewhat accept Angie's ditziness as inexperience in the real world and her outgoing manner... too bad as the series progresses she doesn't seem to learn anything from what she encounters. The next book is Cooking Up Trouble."
3,Cookbook Mysteries,"The book was ok, but a little draggy. I read several mysteries where the main character is involved in cooking, and Angie is just not as exciting a character as the others."
2,terrible follow up to black-trash,"i was looking forward to the new sticky album after his first solo album ""black-trash"" which was a very good album, and had alot of consistancy. but after one listen of ""decade"" i was already bored, and thinking what had happened to the old sticky. i mean some of his lyrics are still very good and ill give him that, but the production is absolutly awful. i dont think theres even one good beat on this album, and even the guest appearences are lame. at least on black trash there were good appearences (i.e raekwon, redman, dave hollister). if your a hardcore onyx fan then this album may appeal to you, but if u didnt like the last onyx album ""bacdafucup 2"" then dont bother with this, and in my opinion this is a complete waste of money. my rating would be 1.5, just for the fact there are some good lyrics."
1,Dissappointment,"I've given this album alotta' tries but it's just not any good. It's completely devoid of Sticky's grimey style vocals and instead has these commercial street trash songs. The beats, as mentioned above, are garbage. They're something you'd expect fabulous or ludacris to spit to. There's one song that has alotta' features which is pretty good but still sticky's outshined by another rapper in that song, maybe X1 I'm not sure of his name. Either way, after Blacktrash sticky had become one of my favorite rappers, second only to the JediMindTricks crew. But after this, I'm thinking he just lost it. went the way of DMX after It's Dark and hell is hot. Save your money, buy a RassKass or JediMinds cd."
1,1.5 stars,"Sticky Fingaz was a dope MC in the 90's. Most of all the ONYX material is worth checkin out and as far as solo efforts, his first and Fredro's first were both excellent releases. This LP makes a great coaster for your studio. I was extremely let down by 85% of the material on this record. The beats were boring and average at best--The lyrical content I slept through. I just couldn't vibe w/it, for having so much respect and love for his work in the past for droppin ill tracks this was a huge let down."
1,what in the world happened!,"I WISH I WOULD OF CAME TO THIS PAGE AND READ ALL OF THE COMMENTS LEFT ON HERE BEFORE I WENT AND BOUGHT THIS GARBAGE, BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WAS STRAIGHT TRASH! NOTHING, AND I MEAN NOTHING, COMPARED TO HIS FIRST ALBUM!"
3,What happend to onyx,damn they used to be straight fire now this damn this album is better the dacdafucup 2 and triggernometry but god this is dissapointing as much as i love your music kirk jones7 of 10 lyrics 5.5 of 10 beats
3,Sticky,What has happened to the old Fredro and Sticky? they ain't the same no more. They've the lost the grimeyness from Onyx. They gotta go back and try to make it underground again and get back the old stuff.
1,garbage,"blacktrash was dope as hell and i was waiting forever for this album. of course, it sucks. I dunno what sticky was thinking, but he shoulda kept the same beats as the first instead of going the club-commercial-ass hip hop crap beats that are playing on the radio. w/e, dissapointment. check kirk jones, that ones dope. leave this where it belongs, in its original packaging box, taped and sealed.."
3,sticky's came a little unstuck!!,"The one thing you're GUARANTEED with a sticky album is entertainment baby and this is no different. Only not as entertaining as the previous joint he dropped ""kirk jones...."" As usual his lyrics are on point, sharp, funny at times and original. He has a knack of telling a tale or spitting a bar that other rappers spit but in his own style and with his own twist. Its just this album lacks the quantity rather than the quality. There's about 10 cracking joints here but there's also 6 weak ones with his boys on them,(they lack his skill and style and pure charisma),that really didnt deserve to be on this. ""Lets do it"", ""Hot now"", ""I love the streets"", ""Girl"",""Shot up"", and my two favourites ""Cant call it"" and ""I dont know"" with fredro starr are unbelievable. Theres at least another 4 bangers too. All in all, damn good album, worth the money, just not as good as ""kirk jones"". That said theres very little out there that is."
4,All the Things You Need to Know About Foreign Countries.,"As an artist I travel alot because it is required of me, but when one tours a country they'll never truly know what to expect, especially since tour guides only reveal the good things about their country. This book is really excellent for people who are interested in not only the physical beauty of a country, but its social and political standings. It's very informative and gets staight to the point."
5,"Soulfully Rocks without ""alternative"" pretentions","The latest album from Acetone rocks more than the self titled cd. York Blvd. is more along the lines of Cindy but more refined. The quiet moments are still here like on 19 and ONE DROP, BONDS but ITS A LIE, LIKE I TOLD YOU, and the opening track are great grooving rock that you can feel deep in your soul. Richie Lee's lyrics are perfect. they can be taken literally or in most cases seem to be impressionistic potraits of episodes in life.Buy this album, put the headphones on, relax and feel the the warm music of Acetone, dont worry Things are gonna be alright."
5,R.I.P. Richie! Long live Acetone!,"Even though I bought this album after Richie (Acetone's singer/bassist) died, I still believe I would think this is the best Acetone album ever! They really hit their peak with this one! Liquid smooth vocals over bluesy trippy guitar and bass lines have always been the Acetone formula, but on this CD they've PERFECTED it! Mark is one of the most underrated guitarists out there now and Steve's drumming always hits the mark perfectly! Stray is definitely my favorite track on this CD! It's really a shame we'll never get to see what else they had up their sleeve! I really hope Steve and Mark continue to jam and put out some new music, because talent like this should not go unused! So do yourself a favor and pick up this CD ASAP! R.I.P. Richie!!! Long live Acetone!!!"
2,Buscemi strikes out,"This movie is one of those primarily character-driven indie movies where, instead of interesting characters, We Duh Audience get to see several kookie/zany/offbeat/quirky-with-a-capital-Q characters tossed together, and then: Let the indie-zone ""comedy"" begin! (For other examples, see ""Inside Monkey Zetterland"" and ""Buffalo 66."")Trouble is, in this ""Vegas,"" 'quirky/offbeat/etc.' equals 'annoying and/or unpleasant.' I don't particularly require a movie's characters to be likeable, just interesting. The characters in ""Goodfellas"" are morally repugnant but fascinating. Here, Buscemi is a spineless gambling addict, and that's pretty much all there is to his character. I should care about him exactly why? Sarah Silverman plays his ""love interest"" but I saw no chemistry between them. Sarah S isn't given much to do except act uncharacteristically ""perky."" The actors are the only elements making ""Vegas"" watchable at all. For Buscemi fans only!"
3,So so,"A couple of funny scenes but otherwise pretty lame. It is a short indie film on a very very low budget. It seems that they just sat down in cafe and said, lets make a movie and went off and made one without much thought. I wouldn't pay money to see this or even to rent it. This movie could have been a lot funnier if they actually sat down and designed a script."
3,Texas Caves - Great Book except for spine.....,"The content of the book was wonderful, as were the pictures. I felt as though I was in the cave. Though I am alittle upset, the spine has already come apart after I read it a couple of times."
2,Difficult to read. Ambiguous. Pedantic,"The work is an arduous read, no doubt about it. Regrettably, though sociology and history (the two genres of the work) can be communicated in a clear fashion, the authors seem to be trying to one-up each-other to see who's the most intelligent. Unfortunately there is probably a paucity of works available on this topic, and there are diamonds scattered about in the work-but rest assured, you will have to dig deep to mine them."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Even for the avid ""Daily Show"" fan (like myself), this book is a bit disappointing. Despite a witty and well written introduction by the Craigmeister himself, page after page of Five Questions tends to wear on the nerves a bit. It was interesting to read through once, but it is not the kind of book you'll read again and again. I suppose you get what's advertised, but you could always watch reruns."
2,Beware Mystery Lovers,"Don't let the title mislead you, this book is a poor excuse for a mystery. I was surprised to find that I had actually guessed the murderer and motive before I was even a third of the way into the book. Perhaps for someone who isn't a hardcore mystery fan it would take a little longer to figure it out, but still there's no genius to the murder mystery part. The plot was fast-paced, perhaps a bit too fast paced for my taste, but by being fast-paced it always has a interesting change of scenery. The romance in it was okay, at times it dragged unlike the story. Jim Walker certainly makes use of his knowledge of civil war history. (as far as that's concerned I'm impressed with the book) Anyone who enjoys reading Gilbert Morris's work will enjoy this book."
3,Fun Collection...way better than the film!,"Skip the film and but the DVD of the TV Series Season One. As far as the music goes, this is a fun little collection of assorted ""witchy"" music. Nothing out of this world original or amazing, but a fun compilation of familiar tunes that will come in handy when you're stuck in the freeway and in need of some toe tapping.Noteworthy are Ella Fitzgerald's jazzy spin on DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD and Steve Lawrence's swingin' version of the TV theme song."
5,Amazing.,"The movie, Bewitched, is truly a bewitching movie to say the least. I adore it incredibly and the music chosen was perfect for the movie. City of Love and 'Bout Time I feel are wonderful songs, just lovely for the selection. I like especially jazz and swing genres which was what many of the songs are based around in this soundtrack.**Great cd to all who aren't quite sure and are contemplating buying it, if you enjoyed the movie, you can take it with you wherever you go in your cd player or your mp3 player with the music from the title."
1,What a Failure,"This soundtrack could have been awesome. It is such a dud! First of all, prior to the film's release, the trailer shown in the movie theatre's had the most awesome, funky instrumental version of the Bewitched Theme and it never made it to the soundtrack. That is what I wanted the most. Nora's chop job on the film really took what could have been an amazing film and soundtrack and destroyed the concept. There are so many great tracks that could have been used on this LP. Nicole could have recorded Sabrina's I'm Gonna Blow You a Kiss in the Wind for instance. This was a failure in my book. One star is too much. Boring!"
3,Good oldies but...,"Some really great music on this one, but definitely not worth $15. Wait till the price goes down some, because if you like this music, chances are you already have most of it. A nice collection overall"
1,A Waste of Money,"This CD should have been all studio tracks. I think that she needs to polish up on her live singing. Maybe if she gets some vocal rest, she'll sound better."
5,Wishing You The Best,"I love this album. I have the cd and the DVD (if you don't have the DVD, then go it.. now!) This album is a blessing to me. I love I'm Still Here, I'm Coming Out, and It's Not Me. I like the rest of the album too. I think every believer should purchase this album, it will minister to you, and the DVD will make you shout where you may be watching it. I urge any and everyone to add Dorinda's DEBUT album to their collection.I CAN'T WAIT FOR #2 DROOPING THIS FALL"
4,Could be better,"I loved the album there are some anointed tracks on here but at the same time, some get too secular for my flavor! That is good in some cases but just not me. There are about 3-4 that i love extremely so I give it only a 4."
5,JUST AWESOME!,Dorinda is an awesome minister and songstress. Her album is only an extendsion of the things that God has blessed her to be able to encourage not only elder persons but also the younger generation to follow God. She ministers through her songs in such a way that you have no choice but to feel God's presence and her debut cd is no.1 in my book. I would encourage everyone and anyone who loves a cd not to only have one good song but the whole cd present itself in such a way that you can relate to every song to buy her cd.
5,Dorinda Clark-Cole,"~This album is beyond anything that is imaginable. Sad to say that I never really listened to the Clark Sisters, but after hearing the first song on this CD I am forever a fan of Dorinda. She exemplifies what an anointed woman of God can really become when she allows the Lord to use her accordingly. Her heart is in this album and so is the Anointed One. After purchase I put the cd in my changer and have not stop listening to it yet. I am a college student and I listen to it until I absolutely~~ have to get out of my car and go inside. I also have an extra copy for my apartment. I have begun to listen to hear in the mornings as I am getting ready for work or school. Keep the faith girl and do what you do best sing and preach. Thanks for being used by God and being an inspiration to all Christian Ladies. I have no one favorite, but I sincerely love them all, because they are gospel.~"
1,off the hook,"Well i think this Cd was off the hook. My favorite was you don't have to leave here, That song has been on repeat on my CD player from the first day i got the Cd. I love that Cd and hopes that it will bless others just like it has blessed me"
5,Awesome CD!!,"I've had the personal pleasure of being taught voice lessons by this dynamic WOMAN of GOD! This CD is AWESOME! In review of this CD, she gives you exactly what the Holy Spirit gave to her with you as a listner feeling the spirit right along with the music. This CD encompasses a style of variety for all age groups to enjoy. I recommend this CD to everyone to add as a part of their Gospel Music listening for the enjoyment of a lifetime!Dorinda (The Jazzy One),May God bless and keep you forever safe in his arms! You are so BEAUTIFUL and I Love you!Rafael"
4,It Feels Like Sunday Mornin',"The debut album from the beautiful Dorinda Clark Cole is an exceptional collection of down home ""Chuch"" music! Isn't that what we love about Dorinda...she takes us to church. Just listen to ""You Can't Take My Joy"" or ""Nobody Like Jesus"" and tell me it doesn't feel like Sunday morning. It was refreshing to hear the Clark sisters reunite on ""Show Me The Way"" and even more, to hear sister Jackie(whom we rarely hear) participate with ad libs. Of course there's Twinkie - wailing and giving the ""black flem"" like no one else can. Love it! ""It's Not Me"" will have you dancing while ""I'm Still Here"" will have you shaking your head and closing your eyes in agreement with Dorinda's majestic voice telling you about the grace of the Lord.Bottom line - It feels like Sunday morning! If you like good ol' gospel music, this CD will bless you."
4,Good Poker Book,"I agree completely with the last reviewer. I like the supportive and down to earth style of this book. He also presents stuff in ways that I haven't read in oher books and helped me to see it in a different light. Thanks Matt. A very good deal,+EV, for under $10:00."
4,Culinary holiday,I fell in love with this book (hard kind) in Istanbul. Sadly only available in softcover elsewhere. This book whisks me back to Turkey every time I take it into the kitchen. Food is exactly what we enjoyed off the tourist track while there. Home cooking not restaurant cooking. I can see the book wearing out!
1,Ingredients,"Most of the ingredients called for are not available in the average super market or even in a ""gourmet"" food store. I couldn't find most of the ingredients even in a community with a large international population. It was most frustrating as I was anxious to try the recipes. The photographs were gorgeous."
4,From a Turkish cook,"I am Turkish and (so I am told) a very good cook for 30+ years. I found some recipes in this book (Klasik kofte, salepli dondurma) that I could not find anywhere else and worked wonderfully.If you are having diificulty finding ingredients, try online sites like penzeys.com or tasteofturkey.com."
3,"Life, rivers and a philosopher","In the essay in which the author describes her initial encounter with graduate level philosophy, Kathleen Moore gave away a major distinction between herself and myself ... her first paper topic was on Descartes - as a undergraduate philosophy major, I thought Descartes marked the point at which Western philosophy became a waste of time. Admittedly my view has mellowed, but Kathleen Moore's essays lack the almost mystical quality one finds in the essays of Kim Stafford, Annie Dillard etc.Several of the essays, however, are charming especially her meditations on poking around, on her elderly neighbor, and on the funeral arrangements for her father. From her essays as a whole, one gets a sense of life fully lived in the details.This is a book I enjoyed, am glad to have read but am unapt to read more than one or two essays again."
2,"the word ""rivers"" caught my attention",I thought this book was about the rivers themselves--perhaps she had floated these rivers and was writing about the sights and scenes. My mistake. The essays are very well done and I appreciate her sincerity and insights. Although there is not a description of the Brazos River in the essay about the Brazos. I enjoyed the human interest but was left wondering how the daughter's relationship turned out!
2,Sluggish,"The concept for this story is very promising--one boy DOESN'T have magic, as opposed to the predictable boy who DOES have magic. And the world was beautiful and interesting. But the writing was so sluggish, I couldn't get into it. The paragraphs were too loooooong for the target age group. The plot chugs along at an agonizingly slow pace. Even the action scenes are sluggish, rather than exciting. I tried skipping every other sentence. A good editor should have eliminated a quarter of the pages, which would have improved the pacing. It's a shame no one did, because the idea is worth the effort. Instead, the intriguing concept fails due to the slow pace. I read stacks of books every month, and it's extremely rare for me to stop in the middle . . . but this one did me in. I stopped half way through and put it back on the shelf. I didn't even read the back page to see how it ended, which shows how bored I was. Sorry."
3,Fall in line with the harcore/metal legacy that Combat created decades ago,"This release completes the trilogy that is the Combat Records relaunch campaign. Just like their label mates, Look What I Did fall in line with the harcore/metal legacy that Combat created decades ago. Barry Donegan is a schizophrenic vocalist that screeches like Cradle of Filth and harmonizes like Incubus. The rest of the band takes their cues from the thrashers and metal gods of the past with furious riffs and pounding drum beats."
1,Worst band ever.,"Look What I Did is to music as Hitler is to the Jews. This band's live performances sound like the term ""sound check"" was never invented. Upon seeing/hearing this band, I instantly think, ""Between the Buried and Me"" wannabes, and ""I wish I made my money by randomly slapping my instrumet behind lyrics about my urges to rape women."" Worst band ever."
5,Perfect match...,...to go along with the shower curtain and towels that I purchased from Amazon. Framed these prints and hung in bathroom. They are pretty quality prints and tied the bathroom decor together nicely!
1,Palm Tree's pic(2),"I have traveled alot and with my new camera,I out do these pics that I had bought a few years back,to some one who dont travel there just fine,but now with my camera,would not have needed to buy these."
2,8x10,"I expected to get a much larger print. The picture led me to think they were atleast 11x13. These arrived and I was very disappointed. I matted them in a bigger frame and will use them. They were inexpensive, sometimes you get just what you pay for."
1,Not what I expected at all. :(,I bought them thinking I was getting something worth while. I was sadly disappointed. They look dull. They just look like they are very dark and not worth putting up at all. Sad. :(
5,Super Spinner!,"I use this salad spinner nearly everyday. It's perfect for a few small salads or a big one for just me. I like the pulling function, it seems to work very well, without a lot of effort on my part. I would recommend this particular model to anyone."
4,The product was delivered as promised.,I bought it as a gift to a friend. It is how he likes it that counts. I like it enough to be tempted to keep it though.
1,poor construction from zyliss,"Just tossed this salad spinner in the trash. This was my second zyliss salad spinner. The first was a different construction and very solid. Unfortunately, it got manhandled by a small child and broken. So, naturally I went with zyliss again...the new design is flawed. The mechanism stripped and the product stopped working. Don't buy this if you actually plan to use it."
2,not as good as they used to be,"Like the vast majority of products these days, this Zyllis spinner is not as good as its predecessor. I know because my old one just broke and I went out and bought a new one. The spinner is not as easy to work and it does not do as good a job of spinning the water out of the greens. Also, I can tell that the plastic will not last as long - its thinner plastic. And the spin mechanism is likely to not last as long because you have to yank on it more to get the spin going fast enough to do some good. Disappointing."
3,Great while it lasted.,Like some of the other reviewers mentioned. This style of salad spinner is fun and works great... until the pulling mechanism gives out. My attempts to disassemble the lid to attempt to fix it have failed. The spinner I had gave out after about a year and a half of frequent & vigorous use. It could likely last longer if treated gently.
2,"it worked great, until it died","I have both large and small Zyliss spinners. They are the greatest, except that the pull mechanism eventually gives out. On the larger one, the string pull got out of whack, and somehow i got it working again, but the with the smaller one, it just seems to be out of commission for good.It's too bad, because they improved the design by making the lid two-piece, so you can pull it apart to clean it. But it was too much to pay to have to fiddle with it to get it to work, and then eventually have it stop working entirely."
3,billy bob sings the blues,"first of all i have to say i love this album, billy bob amazed me with the choice of musicians to work on this with him. although i find it more comical than musically stimulating. the music under this album is great its definately somewhere between george jones and pink floyd. the lyrics could have been thought out alittle more as well as the vocal deleivery but all in all its a great peice to listen to definately not for everyone but if you like weird country music made by the dude from slingblade then you're good to go. if you dont then buy it anyway the trippiness factor of this album makes it worth buying and listening to atleast once so youc an say to your friends i own a record by billy bob thornton"
3,Good but not as great as I would have expected.,"It's a good CD, but only a couple of songs were really great on it. I wish the music would have been available for MP3 download, as I would have only spent money to download the 1 really good song from the CD and not bought the whole album. If you can find this album MP3 downloadable anywhere, I suggest saving your money on buying the whole CD and just download ""Burning Desire."" Not throwing off on the band, as they are rocking to uplift our Lord. I just wasn't overall impressed musically with this album."
2,Not The Original Versions,"Out of the 20 tracks on this 2-CD set, only four tracks are the original versions (Ya Ya, Moon River, Raindrops, The Mountain's High). The rest are re-makes. If your truly love oldies, this is not the CD set for you."
2,Did get what I ordered,I received a different product than what was shown. I received the plastic version of this which is great but not as durable as the metal one.
4,Great quality,This works wonderful - only gave it 4 stars because of the title - it's not what I would have thought of as coarse. I should have ordered the extra coarse for my needs but will get lots of use out of this one.
5,Perfect grater,"Have had this grater for a couple weeks now and have used it to grate hard cheeses,(ie.parmesan, romano, etc) and it's been perfecto every time. The size of the grating is just right, the blades are very sharp and cut clean, and clean up is a breeze. Haven't used it to zest anything yet but I'm sure that I won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a desent grater then this is it."
3,Great grater.,The grater on this thing is great. The handle not so much. Have had to distort the tubing of the handle a couple of times so the head stays in the handle. It's time to do it again. :(Underwhelming. This company's grating products are significantly hampered by their execution. The plastic version of these things are a joke as they last about a week.Too bad
3,good grater for some things only,"I bought this grater for parmesan and pecorino cheese thinking it would be easy to grate but it did not do the job; there was a lot of resistance. My old regular box greater worked better. It is good for citrus rinds ,if you want some coarser grind than the longer stick grater does. I olso tried to grate dry bread ( I make my own crumbs )and it woked great . Maybe I won't need to use the food processor anymore."
1,Aweful book,"This book was assigned as class reading material for my ethics course. I find this book nearly impossible to read. from the very first page it is plagued with poor sentence structures and a plain-black type on white background format that is NOT easy on the eyes. There are no bold words, simple concepts are explained in confusing ways... It has the format of a novel...But it is a education book so it is nearly impossible to pick out key points...You will not be able to scan through this book for the important content....seriously wtf I want to burn this book."
4,Essential reading,"Sets the standard as a reference book, gives useful reference points at the end as source material, much better than pallets."
1,Not Biblical by any stretch,"The book of Jasher will be a big disappointment for anyone looking for some sort of lost scripture. Superficially it reads like scripture but with even more ""thou's"" and ""thee's."" But the plot lines are obviously not biblical in nature and in fact contradict scripture. Don't waste your money. Spend it on the ESV Study Bible."
1,Beware Christians!,It is sad that a man who claims to be Christian can lead others down the wrong path. This is not the same book mentioned in the Bible. People please take note----The book of Jashar does not exist any longer and is a forgery of the same title. Lumpkin is just cashing in on people's lack of research on the book. Do your research on the book. This book was written by some fool hundreds of years ago and people have retranslated it passing it off like it is the real thing. Beware of false prophets and read your Bible.
5,One of my Favorites,"This is one of my favorite PC games. It's a classic, and I don't even know how many hours I've spent on this game. Creating parks and making your own roller coasters is so much fun. The roller coaster editor lets you make roller coasters with unlimited money. Great fun."
2,ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON 2,"COULD BE FUN, GRAPHIC GLITCHES AND I COULD NOT RESSOLVE THE ISSUE EVEN THOUGH MY MEMORY AND GRAPHIC PROPERTIES ON COMPUTER WERE TOP NOTCH HAD TOO MANY ISSUES SO I DON'T PLAY IT. BETTER LUCK TO YOU!"
1,oh my gosh don't even waste your money!!!,this game is so much fun!!!... until you install time twister. it is basically crappy graphics thrown onto the original designs with boring themes. it's really not worth the money. corkscrew follies and loopy landscapes are a much better value because they look like they haven't been thrown together in an hour.
3,Expansion Pack,"This is one of the Expansion packs (the other is Wacky Worlds) it adds levels to the game - but they're harder than ****. they have new rides as well, but mostly canvased rides that are already on the game, just themed to the level."
3,"Not worth the money, not a great addition","Where is Chris Sawyer when you need him?The game does have some new scenery, that is about it. Not a lot of new rides. Didn't really ""add' anything to the game."
2,Still can't think of a title,"Ok, ENOUGH WITH THE SCENERY!!! There is so much scenery, omg, it anoys me. They couldn't have put something else in like a ride your ride thing. Ya the scenery is nice and now some of it actually moves, but I don't really use scenery. Even if I did, there is still too much of it. New rides? Ya right. They did the same thing that they did in Wacky Worlds, replaced the old car with a different looking one. Some new ride.To conclude... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. YOUR NOT MISSING ANYTHING. But if you really wan't all that scenery and new scenorios, borrow it from somebody cause you don't need the disc to play it (you use the RCT2 disc). Just borrow it and install it and you will have it. Again, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,What is the point...,"of this expansion pack? It doesn't really seem to serve any purpose. It's basically a bunch of new scenery, alot of which seems borrowed from other games, like Age of Mythology. The title of the package Time Twister is really misleading, what's the time twisting element in the game? You get a bunch of era themed scenery. Great. Don't waste your money on it, if you must have it, wait until the price goes down. I give it two stars because it has a few new era themed rides that are fun, but that's it."
5,Sound fun,"This is a much needed expansion pack. After Wacky Worlds expansion (which was a 2/10) this is hopfully going to be better. I hops sence it's Time Twister there will be night and day. And seasons (winter, autome, summer). If it has those qaulities this will get alot more people into the game, and it will make the game what it use to be....-keith"
3,Oh Jeez,"Oh great. It's probably just going to be another scenery pack. Not that I don't like scenery or anything but with the current limits on objects, this expansion pack will be living H-E-double hockey sticks(if you know what I mean :) ). I am looking forward to getting this but I'm not dancing around my house about it.P.S. My rating is based on my expectations of it."
1,What a Waste-Cs if your still alive die,"Atari has taken a great game(rct) and utterly ruined. WW(wacky worlds) was a huge and total waste. The origional was supposed to have a sandbox mode(which it didnt), so dont get your hopes up kids. The true fans out there are doing the exact same thing atari is doing by creating scenery. Yet oddly enough, ours is better. Chris you have ruined the game we all so loved by selling out to atari. F You atari thanks for the peice of crap that youve made..Btw you wont be getting my money."
4,Can't wait till tomorrow,Hooray its finally OCT. 20th. I have been counting down to tomorrow and right after shcool im gonna ask for someone to take me to toys r us and buy this game because its only $16.00. I wanna get there early as possible so i can beat the crowds and the games not sold out. I hope they at least stocked more than like 20 because this game might be really popular on the first day. I wanna also be the first 1 on the computer cause everyone else is usually hogging it.......So in other words beat the crowds to the nearest store and ask today so you dont worry tomorrow. Oh yeah and i hope my mom doesnt say i have to wait for Christmas. I'll be like WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,G reat Game!,"I think this game is awesome! It has lots of cool rides like Hall of Mirrors, and the Fun House! You also ger different types of shops and rides! And the animated scenery rocks, it even has a shadow! I recommend the game if you want more things for it!"
2,Think long and hard,"I think you really need to buy this for the right reasons. YES, it will crowd your computer more. NO, it's not as good as the box claims. New rides are fairly much cockamammie new designs -- like new carts or something. Scheme. I think that yes, it's fun, no it's NOT worth it!"
3,Rollercoaster Tycoon Game Fan,I hope it will be allot better win the new Rollercoaster Tycoon Time Twister Expansion Pack comes out I hope it be allot better. I hope they add time to it like Day and Night. When gets dark all lights come on. And they should add a life gaurd to save people in the water. That what someone else told me. Also they should add some cars like they drive by and people come in out there car. And come in the park. And I hope the new Add-On for this game will make the game hole lot better just like the cover should show in the real life.
4,Good Fun Movie - Great Carny Feel,"While some of the sequences in this film are lacking in production values, it's great to see a horror film based on the carny lot. As being an ex-worker of a sideshow myself, the things Gunnar Hansen says in the film are very true to form. It's a fun story and a decent flick. I personally LOVE the low budget horror films and this one rates very high in my book! Give it a try. You won't be dissapointed."
2,relatively speaking,"I am currently taking a course in which this text is our primary learning manual. Relative to physics textbooks in general, it went into great detail concerning fairly advanced topics. However, it did not do a good enough job of laying down the fundamental principles of physics, which makes it more difficult to comprehend the more involved topics. The book also lacks a glossary and a comprehensive index. The examples are either too complex or too simplistic, and I have been forced to use several other books as auxiliary materials. If you are a physics instructor, I implore you, please DO NOT USE this text in an introductory course, unless the primary goal of your class is to drive away students from the study of physics, ranting madly about."
1,Not very pedagogic,"I am an introductory student in physics and our techer told us to buy this book since he thought it was a very good book.I don't agree.The book contains a lot of interesting material, but has few examples which can tell you how to use the new knowledge. The examples in the book is either very easy or hard to understand beacuse they don't tell you how they came up with the equation they use so solve the problem.Don't buy this book. Buy University Physics instead. Much better"
1,Boring and non-illustrative,"The book has a lot of boring and non-illustrative methods to show how to get the formulas derived. It uses just the colors; black, white, blue and grey to make illustrations, this make the figures hard to understand.Das Buch hat eine Menge das Bohren und nicht-illustrative Methoden zum Zeigen, wie man die Formeln berechnet erhält. Es verwendet gerade die Farben; schwarz, weiß, blau und Grau zum Bilden der Abbildungen, diese Marke die Abbildungen hart zu verstehen."
4,Neat salad scoopers,I bought these as a gift after I used my friends at a dinner party. They hang on the side of the salad bowl until you're ready to use them. They also allow you to scoop up a good helping of salad without dropping lettuce all over the place.
4,More than one knows,"This book probably has about 600 ""things"" listed in its almost 400 pages. It's fun, it gives one a chance to really think about our likes and dislikes in things we didn't even know we had favorites. It includes fun game ideas for using it!"
2,Too good to be true or everyone would be doing it,"Not realistic, as most athletes train pretty hard for their spor"
4,"They taste pretty awful, but they really do the job.","I choke one of these down after 40 mins or so on the bike and it helps keep me going 'till the end of my ride. They're very small and store well, so I can easily cram a few of them in my rear bag on the cycle. Drink some water after them and the taste goes away almost instantly. so it's survivable. :)"
2,nope- not a fan,The taste plus the amount of sugar to make it taste more like frosting ....can't say I recommend it at all
4,Good energy,Great quick energy in a small easy to use package. I always carry one or two packets with me when biking.
5,Best energy goo. Love Vanilla.,"I really like the vanilla flavor. I used these during the Ragnar and they were golden. I only used a GU every 3-4 miles, however, which is less than they recommend."
5,Great for Tough Mudder,"Just got done running the Tri-State Tough Mudder and it was awesome. I would take one Gel every 4 miles and I had a ton of energy. I never cramped up or slowed down. I would highly recommend this product for any Tough Mudder event. Trust me, you need every last bit of energy to get over that final wall."
4,GU Peppermint Energy Gel,My wife is a working towards running full Marathons and Triathlons. She reports an amazing boost in energy when running distance. She even reports that the peppermint flavor soothes her stomach/acid reflux. The package size & shape fit well into her running belt as well as the package is easily opened while running. The few drawbacks are that it is very thick and sticky. If you get it on you fingers it is getting on everything you touch and as a distance runner you cannot just stop and wash your hands. The other thing she was concerned with is the refined sugar content of the gel.The performance is great and she will probably purchase it again.
4,Tasty easy energy,"I purchased the Tri Berry flavor for some longer run training and have been very happy with the product. I didn't initially like the taste of the Tri Berry flavor but by my 3rd gel I actually began to enjoy the taste. They're definitely an easy and efficient way to maintain nutrition on long runs/bikes. I make sure not to consume anything from two hours before a run because I have a pretty fussy stomach, but I had no stomach problems whatsoever after consuming these on runs.Like others have said they are a bit thick so it's best to take them with water. I've seen people empty a Gu gel into a water bottle then mix it up with water to get a sort of Gu drink but I've never tried that. The only other minor con with these is that they are very very sticky so try to avoid getting any on your hands.Those little setbacks are the only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars. I'm definitely going to order some more and try some new flavors."
5,As necessary as a calculator,The book covers every conversion that will ever be needed and most professors will allow it in the classroom. It saves time and prevents simple math errors from lengthy conversions.
4,Remington Shaver,"I've used this electric razer since it came on the market serveral yearsago and found that it gave a close shave, and trimmed my sideburnsand neck areas with excellent ease. There's more to grooming a face thana shave....check the hair around the ears and neck areas. This Remingtondoes it all and reasonably. It also runs about 1 week on a charge and chargesin about an hour. Very portable."
1,I can see why they are discontinuing this razor,"This one OK for a shaver, but it's ridiculous to have to spend $10 to $20 per month or so for a replacement head (if you can even find them) when the head fills up. What were they thinking???? I guess they thought people would be stupid enough to make monthly payments on an electric razor. Since they have discontinued making them, I guess they found out otherwise."
1,black and white- seriously?,I was very excited to get this book as i collect gemstones. But let me ask you this: how can you appreciate gemstones in all their glory if this book is in black and white? are you serious? a description of brilliant green can not be done justice if everything is in shades of gray. This book is a waste of money unless you are using it as a text book. I'd return it if i felt like making the trek to the post office.
1,Outdated information from outdated author,"These ""Secrets of the Gem Trade"" have been old news for years. This outdated book continues to offer the same old content that is simply reworked with a new cover every few years. The ""secrets"" are not secrets and the information it contains is outdated and fails to include many of the new developments of the gem industry including treatments and synthetics. While the author is a great showman, the contents of this book are old news and fail to include several important gemstones. There are many other books out there that are far more accurate, and contain updated information and the latest developments in the industry. Simply stated, the ""Secrets of the Gem Trade"" stopped being secrets years ago. Its just a matter of how many times RW Wise can rework the cover and make it appear that he has produced something new."
5,Very informative,"As an admiring neophyte in the gem world I found this book to not only be very informative but also very entertaining. It almost reads like a novel. At one point, I remember not wanting to put it down. The information is put in plain language for anyone to understand and is not cluttered with a lot of technical jargon that is not basic. Very well organized. Brenda"
4,Great information and images.,"With wonderfully good information and great images, the writer introduces a wide reaching and vast amount of valuable information through a fascinating, personalized journey. However this otherwise excellent treatise could be made infinitely better by a more professional publishing house. The typography, layout, and copy editing are awful, albeit I absolutely love the riveting cover."
5,amazing,"i don't really want to draft my personal thoughts on each song, as a few of the reviewers have already hit that mark.. i simply want to expres my love for this album and broken social scene as a band.. if you are into indie, and chill instrumental/experimental type music.. check out this album.. its not perfect, but the first 5 songs, and last 4 songs are more than enough to earn this album a rating of 5 solid stars.. give it a listen, it's beautiful."
2,"Heavy on drone, light on substance","2 1/2This popular indie rock band's earlier material consisted of little more then rambling, ambient soundscapes with the occasional vocal thrown in-a far cry from the brisk, intelligently structured songs the band became known for, although holding much aesthetically in common with their latest, heady release. Like their '05 self-titled release, Feel Good Lost quickly becomes a rabbit hole of studio experimentation, though unlike that disc, this one usually lacks a moving center despite all the heavy textural noodling."
2,Its ooookkaaaay...,"Ive heard the ""best"" tracks off this album, which include love and mathematics, guilty cubiicle and passport radio and i must say im unimpressed. Its sad background music and by no means anything close to how good you forgot it in people is. In comparison to you forgot it, this album could be a single star."
1,sucks madly,"i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out!"
5,This is great,"I use this for kayaking trips fairly frequently. No leaks yet, I like the smoked look. Durable and quite nice."
4,Great for storing stuff at theme parks,"Very easy to use. Kept our stuff dry during water rides at theme park. The vinyl does stick together, so it isn't meant for repeated opening and closing throughout the day. It held the complete contents of my backpack, which made it easy for the security check at the entrance."
4,Keeps grooming products and clothing items separate!,"When traveling shampoo, toothpaste and the like getting into you underwear is never a good thing, regardless of what Martha Stewart may think. The SealLine keeps your grooming products out of your clothes."
4,"Nice, but makes me worry","I purchased this dry bag to keep my stuff dry while kayaking. Generally, I like this bag. Its main advantage being transparency. It makes fishing out contents so much easier while holding it from different angles. Also, if you have a couple of them you know exactly which one has what. The reason I took one star off is because the appearance of a seal around the bottom started worrying me. Specifically, at the point where it meets the vertical one. The see-through plastic started curling up from the black non-transparent bottom at that particular spot. While the seal joint is thick, the degradation has me worried a little."
5,Great Bag,This waterproof bag is used in a kayak and has served the purpose of keeping everything dry that I have in it. It fits into the opening where I keep it which isn't that big. Fits because it is long and not fat and bulky. Love it!
4,"Beautiful stories, beautiful artwork","The stunning illustrations will draw you and your children in to this book, where you'll find wonderful stories -- some of which have overtly spiritual themes, some which explain Easter traditions, and others which are just fun. The shorter poems can be read to younger children. I would have given this book 5 stars except that it quotes from the King James Version of the Bible - please, authors, give us more kids books that use age-appropriate versions of the Bible."
2,Not-too-happy Easter,"I was hoping from its description that this book would offer a sort of Unitarian Universalist explanation of Easter and its symbols - one my young children would be able to understand and appreciate, without being scared. Unfortunately we started with the Oscar Wilde tale of the scary giant who eventually meets a boy with big holes in his wrists and immediately dies. Uh...what? Not good bedtime material. We tried some others that were more factual, but unfortunately they either completely blew the cover off the Easter bunny or read like dry essays. The illustrations are pretty, but I'm sending this one back."
5,this is the 21th century,"the product arived in two days as stated, welds, paint, bolts, overall apperance were top notch, all holes lined up properly. the bolt snake sent with hardware package made job a lot easier to get bolts in place.time factor was off-I used air ratch, then finished with torque wrench was done in 15 minutes. hitch fit tight no rattle"
4,Raymond Burr is Great,"I watched this movie primarily to see Raymond Burr in an early role, and while he only gets ninth billing, he gives by far the most interesting performance. As was usual for him at this point in his career, he portrays a villain, but plays him against type, i.e., though evil, he's an amiable and charming fellow. This was ten years before Burr achieved fame as Perry Mason, and it's great to see him so young (about 30) and in a very different role. Otherwise, this is a typical Hollywood western, nothing much to distinguish it, but entertaining nonetheless."
4,beautiful lamp,"I ordered this lamp because it was a perfect choice for above my very casual dining room table. It arrived in a huge box, seemingly wrapped well. Unfortunately, after the lamp was hanging for more than a week, we noticed that two of the pieces of glass had a crack in them. Since they are not obvious unless you really look, we decided it was not worth the trouble/expense of returning."
4,"Generally good, lacks some vital info","I appreciate this dictionary for its consistant knowledge of major authors, books, countries, mythology and other traditional information. It is, however, missing most current pop culture information about movies, actors...etc."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This video just glosses over the history of the falls and throws in some fluffy depictions to make people feel warm and fuzzy. I watched ""Niagara-A history of the Falls"" by the History Channel first which was 100 percent better than this DVD. Without the knowledge gained from watching this DVD first I would have not understood parts of the IMAX DVD."
1,ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz....... so boring,This is a badly produced IMAX film. There is a tale with mediocre imaging and sound... what a waste of time and money!
1,"FAKE, FAKE, FAKE!!!","This movie is extremely bad. Do not buy it. I want to know is what the hell was the director thinking($$$). I myself could've done a better job. Black cat goes into the barrel & after the fall she turns white, must've been terrified from the fall & her hair turned all white. Don't insult people's intelligence, we are in America, not China or India. The guy walking on the rope across the falls looks so fake, you were better off just telling us about the guy's story and not show what he did. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. You will waste your money, I guarantee it. Stupid, Stupid movie. I'm hoping I can return this movie & get my money back."
2,A Story So Simple,"Your five your old child could have wrote it. This is what I don't like about Imax films. They try to tell a story but it is so elementry you wonder what is the purpose. If you can not tell a interesting story why try. Niagra is certainly a beautiful place; but the movie would have been better serve if they went the educational,historical,adventure or eye candy route. Instead we are treated to a story a seconed grader would appreciate at the expense of some beautiful photography."
2,ok at best,OK - we've got battlesuits instead of robot planes I guess so we can have people be put in harms way.Pretty much this was blah and boring.And it's got a stupid sex scene in it - Dale Brown's characters tend to be on the iffy side anyway but he should just NEVER write about sex.Stick to airplanes!
1,Who is this author???,"Wow...was this written by Dale Brown's administrative weenie alter-ego. Let me sum it up! If you like books that exhaustively delve into government forms/procedures/ and meeting rules/regulations...stop...because you've found your book!! If ,instead, you remember the Military action/adventure writer named Dale Brown then I am sure he's still out there somewhere...just not present in this book! BORING!"
1,Each book gets worse,Dale Brown had been going down hill for years and reached his low point with this one. Time to take up a new profession.
3,"Good concept, average story","This book started out like a real page turner. The concept of terrorists detonating a nuclear device in the USA should make for scary,thought provoking reading. However the book turned more to a science fiction theme with contrived situations and enormous plot holes. There was not much suspense since the reader knows all the players or can easily figure out who the bad guys are. Not at all up to par with Brown's earlier works. Wait for the paperback."
3,SLOW READ,I WAS HOPING THE BOOK WOULD BE A FASTER READ. THE PLOT SEEMS TO JUST GET TO A LEVEL AND COULD NOT GET TO A HIGHER LEVEL. HOPEFULLY THE NEXT DALE BROWN BOOK WILL BE BETTER.
3,"Here we go again - a new ""Tin Man""","Just when you get to the point of taking the Tin Men battle group for granted Dale throws a new technology twist at us, CID. Climb in and take control of the robot and have all the super powers...But the plot of a nuclear bomb going off in Houston and possibly other American cities keeps you in for the long haul. Add the typical back-stabbing treason, Russian terrorists (this time) and you have Act of War: A Novel.Push the raised eye brows over the new technology aside and you have the classic Brown novel, flawed main character and all. A good read, not a great read. This is not Flight of the Old Dog, arguably Brown's greatest (and first) novel but if you are an avid Dale Brown reader you will enjoy this one as well."
2,How many stars?,How many times can you read lines in Spanish? Russian? Or Portuguese that you don't understand?How many times can you read how an awesome machine works?How many times can you read how the goons were armed and prepared for a raid?How many times these goons can escape?So my last question: how many stars?
2,Blech.,"What character development there was tended to be stereotypical, empty and wooden. Premise less credible than most techno-thrillers. Filled out, this could have been good."
1,TEDIOUS!,"VERY SLOW DEVELOPING, AND, ENOUGH ALREADY WITH THE ITALICIZED PHRASES IN PORTUGESE, RUSSIAN, AND WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT ELSE. IT REALLY GOT IN THE WAY.COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT TO END--NOT ONE OF DALE BROWN'S BEST!"
1,"Oh my.. bad, bad, bad...","And Suddenly, there was a flash.. and so starts at least 4 battle scenes. We never learn how the task force gets it's intelligence to be where the terrorists turn up, how they get into position, what planning is done or if there is any plan. Each time, they just suddenly appear at the right time and surprise the terrorists.The action in each of the battles is slow. You can almost count the minutes that the task force is standing around idle whilst the terrorists are firing away.. and of course, most of them get away each time.The dialogue between characters is incredibly weak and could easily have been written by a 14 year old. That is not to insult any 14 year olds, just a comparison to the language that you would expect from a young teenager of today.Overall, extremely poor written book and boring cartoonish action."
1,Really bad writing,"This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy."
1,Did Dale Brown really write this?,I haven't purchased a book by Dale Brown in many years but enjoyed those that he wrote such as Hammerhead 20 years ago. The plot on this was loose and painfully unbelievable. The characters were unidemensional and basically it is one of the worst books that I have read of this genre.
1,"Just silly, not even stupid.",This book is so silly it doesn't even qualify for being stupid.Worthless. Shame on Dale Brown and/or his factory writers.
1,In a Word - Juvenile,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. This book seems to have been written by a 12 year old boy. Simplistic, almost cartoonish, plot and character development. I found it so unbearable after about 50 pages, it went in the trash."
1,A complete wast of time & money,"I cant imagine any one accepting this unbelievable story line. It's garbage, probably one of if not the worst I've ever read. I made it through 30-40 pages before it ended up in the trash.So much for this author, he may have had a winner or two but from this point on he's on my ""do not buy list""I gave it a one star because there was nothing lower."
4,Makes me laugh.,Steve Byrnes is funny without being too crude or over the top. Enjoyable DVD- I look forward to seeing his other work as well.
4,Surprisingly good!,"Steve Byrne was pretty funny. I laughed out loud a few times. Well worth the watch. And I would say Steve Byrne has a sobered version of Dane Cook style about him (he even talks in a lisp like Dane Cook sometimes does). By sobered, I dont mean Steve Byrne is incredibly less funny than Cook just less spastic. The bulk of Steve Byrne's act concerns being Asian, dating girls, having sex with girls, and not being sexually attractive enough to girls so he can have sex with them"
5,HILARIOUS!!!,"My friend got me tickets to the taping of ""Happy Hour"" with Steve Byrne and it was unbelievable funny. I am not that big into stand-up comedy but this was some of the funniest stuff I have ever seen in my life. Since the show I can't seem to get enough of Byrne. I've seen all his stuff on youtube, myspace and comedy central and its all HILARIOUS! I already pre-ordered this DVD and can't wait for it to come out. I know this is going to be on TV for free, but the 10 bucks is worth it to get all the dirty jokes that won't be aired on Comedy Central."
3,It's ok,Saw Steve Byrnes in the Kims of Comedy. This one's ok. This had most of the materials from Kims of Comedy but wasn't executed as well. Still pretty funny.
1,Same as FAA book,Everything in the book is from the FAA Instrument Flying Handbook which was published as printed in this book in 2007. The content is great. All the FAA publications are and none are copyrighted as our tax dollars paid for them. But Sky Horse does not have a right to claim this publication is more recent that what the FAA or others publish.
5,Beware of scams...,"First off... this is an essential book. Do note that it can be downloaded for free from the FAA:[...]...but many times it's better to have the print version. There are some vendors selling illegal CD versions of this on Amazon when you purchased that are not paperback as listed. Do NOT accept this if they send you a CD. Demand the print, book version if you purchase it - and do not tolerate the scams."
3,Poor Images,Book is a reprint of the FAA version. The publisher should clear up some of the images. They are hard to read. Printed in China.
1,So Many Blurred/Barely Legible Figures Printed,"The reason I bought this new manual is the earlier version has a lot of erroneous contents(explanation/figure showing); FAA issued a 12-page-changes in 2009, I don't like the inconvenience when reading the earlier version. I wish the new one I bought will have no issues like these, but it comes out with new problmes. There are so many figures printed with blurred words and/or numbers which are just critical in understanding the relevant concepts. I contacted the publisher, Skyhorse Publishing, and all I got was a standard answer-return it. I wish Skyhore could do a good job, or let others do it.Samples of blurred fighures with barely legible words/numbers on pages:1-15, 1-18,..., 3-7,3-23,3-24,and many many more throughout the manual."
2,Pass...,The diagrams are blurry and the size of the book is too big to fit upright in a standard bookshelf...
1,dont buy this version,"the book was created with a trial version of some epub to kindle software. a message appears every few pages stating so. the developer is stealing from that software company, you, and I."
4,Good Facts in Book,"Does a good job explaining things past what is on the practical exam. Not a lot of 'how to' but a lot of 'what to do'. Not a book to buy if wanting to get into IFR flying, but a great book if you are already IFR rated and want to improve.Lucas HartfordEvergreen[...]"
3,Good Overall Grater,"This grater is efficient and sharp. However, I feel that it is a little too large to use for citrus zest and a little too small to use for grating an onion. If this is the size you are looking for, this grater works really well, I just felt like it is kind of an awkward size."
3,not what I expected,"I was looking for the grater that grates carrots into thin pasta-like strands (for Korean carrot salad). My Mom has one that is very hard to use, so after a long search this one came the closest. It grates carrots into short shavings that other users called ribbons, but it was not what I was looking for. I already removed the labels (I had to to try it out), so I'm stuck with it now."
4,2-4-6-8...,"Excellent video! Nice scenery choreographed into several steamy vignettes. Good variety of tastes all wrapped into one package. Delightfully beautiful ladies shown exercising, showering, playing, and stripping. Carmen Electra performs a cute song toward the end of the video with several cheerleaders, but doesn't even take off her bra. If she's not nude, then why is she in this video? That drops the rating down one star for a score of ""4"", and that's my final answer!"
5,Every Angel in the Bible,This was a very in depth study about Angels. It is based on scripture without a lot of opinion added. I believe it is as accurate accounting of Angels as any available.
2,what about the subject of the book,"Very good, but he doesn't stick to the subject of the book. He does a LOT of preaching, which loads the book down with way too much information to be readable. Good stuff, but I only wanted the relevant material."
5,Authentic Oi,"Look, this is what Oi is all about, I'll spare you the Blah Blah Blah about working class, I'm 38 and this was my scene when I was a teenager. This album was one of a series of Oi compellations that came late, I believe they were originally released by Link, or better known as cheap Link due to the quality. Brings back memories, buy this if you want to add the authentic Oi sound to your collection."
4,Strength Thru Oi,this is bar none one of the greatest oi comps to ever be compiled. the only reason i wont give it five stars is because of the spoken word. sorry garry im not english and todays youth have slightly different problems. this album is nothing but the best skinhead music of the day and the songs are about a lot of the realities of living on the streets that youths today as well as yesterday can relate to. if you listen to oi and dont like this album you should consider changing genres.
5,malawi suffered in silence,To all those who help in taking power from Dr Banda I have to hand it to them for a job well done. This book proves how Dr Banda and his so called government treated people in Malawi and how Africa dictators are so greedy and have lack of human respect.
2,disappointing,"While I have a lot of respect for Thursell (Snog and Soma are both outstanding bands in totally different genres) I am unimpressed with black lung. The beats on this album in particular are... uninteresting. At best they are boring, at worst they are headache-inducing. And the nature of the music is such that there's not much to talk about *besides* the beats.When the album dips into more ambient territory, the quality picks up, which earns it two stars.In the end, I'd say don't gamble on this disc unless you know what you are getting into. Thursell's bands with Peiter Bourke are far better."
4,Classic ligabue style,"Ligabue's latest release has several short comings that caused it to lose the fifth star in my book. While vacationing in italy i found myself channel surfing one day and i saw a live ligabue concert on rai due. I immediately fell in love with the bands sound and character, as well as zanny yet powerful songs. However many of the songs rely heavily on slang and play on words, which makes understanding very difficult for the average american listener. Also many of the best songs are explained much more in depth by their music video, and as i have yet to see an italian song on MTV...However ligabue is good enough that their lyrics do not need to be understood, the music can just carry you away."
5,Good homeopathic remedy for blocked milk ducts during breastfeeding.,"Very helpful in clearing blocked ducts. Must be steeped in boiling water before applying to breast, which is a little more involved than I would like. Very pleased to have an all natural and organic remedy. Would recommend this product to others."
2,too much hassle for new mom,not sure why people would want to use this. it seems like too much hassle and not effect for my issues. case of 3 is over kill. planning to give the extras as baby shower gifts.
1,Unbelievably poor,"I was amazed how such poor poetry could be published. One can only assume that Kim publishes such rubbish himself. The poems were uninspiring, boring and lacked flow or direction. The material contained within these poems was childish and totally inane. Some of the poems contained material of an explicit nature. I was disappointed at the number of basic errors and typos. One wouldn't expect that from a supposedly top class author such as Kim. I feel that Kim's poetry needs to improve considerably if he wishes to pursue a career in that field."
1,peurile,"When I purchased this book from my local Borders, I was expecting an interesting and lively set of poems. After reading the first few poems, I realised that I've been duped. The poetry was pathetically poor and very dull to read. The content was very childish with inanimate objects taking up human properties. I suppose the author was targeting readers that are stupid enough to believe that a computer mouse squeaks in a similar fashion to a real mouse. Kim really has a lot to learn when it comes to writing good poetry that is suitable for an intelligent, mature and inquisitive readership."
1,"Far fetched, wierd and nonsensical","I found this collection of poems by Kim to be the wierdest I've ever read. They were so far fetched e.g. we had computer cables taking on human appearence and personality. I feel that even five to six year old kids would find these poems rather peurile and babyish. The quality of poetry was some of the worst I've ever read, it was badly edited and appears to be the work of an amateur. Some of the poems were sexually explicit and could cause offence to certain readers. This collection of poems represent poor value for money and there are many cheaper poetry books, which are of a higher quality."
1,deceiving ad,"This is only for one brush, not a set as shown. When I got a huge box holding only one small brush, I was sure there was a mistake. But no, it was just my mistake for trusting the picture and not thoroughly reading. It's not even that great of a brush."
3,I don't get it,"I enjoyed reading this book, however I did think the General talked so much, I really missed a lot about the guest's role.And I really didn't understand the very end!"
1,a waste of time.,"this book was boring... i hated it and still do... it was a complete waste of my life reading this book. it goes nowhere... absolutely nowhere... it sounds really interesting, but dont do it."
4,Lovely writing in this small dark novel.,"This is the first of the new Márai translations that I have had the occasion to read. His writing is a discovery that I am happy to have made, and I will be looking read more of his work in the future. His style is lovely. Mann (as the editorial reviews note) comes to mind, as does the more modern Thomas Bernhard.The subject matter of Embers is very specific and may limit its ultimate audience. It is very concerned with ideas about male friendship, power imbalance, and the insider/exile relationship. While I found the book lovely in its writing and occasionally very moving, I also found it overly heavy and sonorous. The writer was a great find for me; the book itself was somewhat less so.Embers is a deceptively quick read. The straightforward plot can carry the reader right past the point where they may need to stop and think about what Márai is saying. Recommended."
2,Boring and Forgettable,"It is a good thing the book was so short or I would have tossed it aside. There is one thing I hate in a story and it is the constant appearance of the phrase 'as if'. It was in the book about three to four times per page and when it appears that often I come to near tweeking myself near to a stroke. Okay, the story was interesting enough even though I had practically guessed the whole plot beforehand, but even though the general explained everything down to the teeth, there were still too many unanswered questions. I nearly screamed when he threw Krisztina's journal in the fire. COME ON! You seriously kept your wife's journal sealed for forty-one years without opening it and just tossed it to the flames in front of Konrad. No one is that noble when such a thing as attempted murder and infidelity are on the table, no matter how old you are. How is this book an international bestseller? Beats me."
4,embers,I found this book utterly fascinating and look forward to more of this master's work being translated. Sylvia Winner
4,Embers by Sandor Marai,The product was in great condition although it was used. It took some time to receive the book as it was shipped ground and I don't think that it was shipped right away. Good value.
5,Finest piece of literature I have ever read,"Once in a while I come back to this Amazon page to see what others readers have to say about this book, trying to add another dimension to this book I love so much and inspire some more hours of elucubrations. How can a few hundred pages bring so much philosophy?Marai was able to create a narrative that seems like two mirrors in front of each other, with an infinite succession of stories behind the apparent main story. From each interpretation you can affirm this is a book about friendship, romantic love, class relations, hierarquies, war, Europe's fall before WWII, or whatever. The two friends, their families, the deceased wife and the old maid play many roles in countless parallel interpretations."
2,Disappointing,"I think the many high reviews for this book have more to do with what it promises than what it actually delivers. The title, itself, calls up wonderful images and the story line is, in theory, fine material. The actual experience of reading the book was frustrating, though. I simply got bored by the oblique narrative style and the dolorous atmosphere of the book. Marai shoots for a very sophisticated and roundabout way of introducing the facts of the narrative, but he doesn't quite pull it off. Two novels which do a better job of playing out the same basic story line (i.e., recalling youthful friendships later in life, in a European historical context), are Olaf Olafsson's Absolution and Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited."
2,this not a translation from hungarian,"I find it shameful that this book is not translated from the original Hungarian, but that it is a translation of a German translation (I dont know about the Penguin edition - I wonder). Of course presses save money by hiring translators of more common languages (competition drives translation prices down, therefore a translator from GErman might cost less than one from Hungarian). However, I would think that an author of this statue would deserve an original translation, and that a press of this caliber (Random House) would have the honesty to hire a Hungarian translator. I can't believe that in the entire English speaking world there would not be qualified writers to do it. In all other languages, the translation is direct from the original(and, in the case of Spanish, beautifully I must say). What we are reading here has little to do with the original: this is cheating for the sake of profit. It's shabby."
3,Embers,Took time to become completely involved with this story line. An interesting story. I would recommend it to many but not to all.
3,'two old friends on whom the sun is setting have much to remember',"Wonderful atmospheric start as an elderly widowed general receives a letter from an old friend, Konrad, whom he has not seen for 41 years. As they sit down to one final meal together we learn of the history between them and the general raises a number of points about the human condition: love, hate, old age and friendship as he seeks closure on the past."
4,Brillant Idea!!,"There is nothing on the market like this...skull candy is the first and last to make these....listen to your mp3 or other music player and also able to answer calls with built in mic and volume on control on the earbuds....works with any phone and and muisc source...the only catch is...the send/recieve button on the earbuds works differently with every model/brand of cell phone..in my case it doesnt do anything...but other brands..it can be used for send/recieve calls, mute, voice calls, etc...all in all its still a great product...decent price...can also be used by itself with your cell phone as a headset or if you have an mp3 player built into your phone you can use to listen to music and then when a call comes in you can used it take calls or make calls...still works with all phones for auto answer and voice dailing..just have to adjust your settins on your phone..and hey their also a great pair of earbuds for just listening to you mp3 player. Skullcandy makes good audio products."
2,Really old,"These earbuds sound pretty good, but they're kind of a waste of money because no one can actually use this for their phone anymore"
2,"Poor sound quality, a bit of a disappointment","The novelty of a two-in-one headset is a fun idea. Notice that one of the plugs is smaller than the standard MP3 slot (read the description of the product). However, the worse part of these is that they sound very empty. Quite a disappointment as I have been pleasantly impressed with SkullCandy for their low cost with fair sound from other earbuds that we have purchased. Still, they work, and that counts for one star I suppose. :)"
1,Waste of Time,"This is one DVD set that I wish I had rented first. There is almost no new information to be had. If you want a quick overview of the stories, this one is for you. If you want in-depth investigative reporting on these subjects. Don't bother. I would have rather have gotten the IN SEARCH OF... series. At least they attempted to come to some sort of conclusions."
5,Got it for Grammy Chucks but ended up reading it!,"I had gotten this book for my Grandmother for Mothers Day because she is a big Pride fan. I had recived it a little late (because I ordered late) and decided to read the first few pages and see what the hype was about. SO, read the whole thing and now listen to Mr. Prides music. It was a good easy read about a dream, the struggle, and the aftermath."
5,Charley Pride story,"This is a great book, very interesting. I learned things about Charley that I did not know. He did not have an easy road being accepted as a Country Singer!! He is very much a gentleman!! I'm a big fan!!"
4,good used book,I wanted a used book to read that was in great shape and low cost. I got that exactly. If you like Charley Pride it is a good book.
5,Should be required reading,Fast paced narrative covering a subject often avoided. The author shuffles the race card into the deck and deals a worst case scenario for the United States.
4,NASB Giant Print- Very good!,"Nice Bible, I love it!! Not too big and not too small...nice leather and I just appreciate the additional referenceswhen I am doing a study! A must have!"
4,Good price,"1. The font size is larger than typical and easier to read.2. The text is in two columns.3. There are paragraph headings and references.4. There is no book marking ribbon that typically comes with.5. It's not a study bible with notes at the bottom of each page.6. Christ's words in red is nice.7. There is Concordance at the end.8. 8 pages of map at the end.9. Cover is an imitation leather.Overall, I like it and is a helpful complement to my NIV study bible, which is too bulky to carry around all the time."
1,CHEAP & UGLY,"NOT BONDED LEATHER!!! Cheap looking, cheap paper, ""leather look"", and icky gold. I own the bonded leather version of this Bible and it is much nicer. I ordered this one as a gift, thinking I was getting the same as mine, only to be shocked that amazon would list this cheap version as ""leather bound"". I'll order my Bibles from CBD from now on."
2,"NASB Giant Print Reference Bible, Personal Size","I was disappointed with this item, it was advertised as leather bound but when I received this bible it was imitation leather."
5,Great study supplement,"I am a seminary student and already had numerous translations of the Bible. My pastor recommended the NASB as one of the most true translations, and I have found that to be true. I love the size of the print in this Bible, and it is hard to find the larger print in the smaller editions. It is a very helpful with the center reference and notes."
2,Not happy,"I just received the bible today. I was so excited!! But when I opened it and felt it in my hands, it felt cheap. Cheap material, like it has thin cardboard inside the imitation leather. I can't imagine this bible lasting very long at all. When opening the bible, you have to really open it wide since there is not a margin to speak of. Very disappointed and I plan to return it if Amazon will allow it."
5,Senior Citizen,"As a Senior Citizen, I was getting to the point where I could not readregular print in a Bible. I had an NASB Bible I was using. I receiveads from several Bible Book Clubs but the prices are high on a limitedincome. I came to the internet and tried Borders/Amazon and found a newBible at about 1/4th it would have cost otherwise. I ordered it andreceived it in a flash. Thank you. Now I know the best way to savemoney is through Amazon...."
2,"NASB Giant Print Reference Bible, Personal Size","NASB Giant Print Reference Bible, Personal SizeFirst of all it is not Giant Print only Large print, and it said Leather bound, but it was only Premium leather look, very disappointing"
4,"good size print, no margins",This is a fine Bible just for reading. But I prefer one with references and a larger margin.
3,I bought mine brand new for $20 a pair and I'm pretty happy with that,"This is a low end product that will sound good when hooked up to an entry level system. The woofer isn't really reactive enough, and though they claim to have a low end Frequency Response at 50hz, I'd find that hard to believe, it sounds closer to 120hz.I'd recommend them if you're on a budget, and you want something better than HTIB speakers, but you will be missing audio that you'd be able to hear in a speaker $10-20 more a piece."
1,Junk,"This thing didn't work at all. I've tried it everywhere. Before my line driver, out of my head unit, going in to both amps. All this thing did was cut out the bass in my subs and 6x9s. And the engine noise whine was still there!!!"
2,Does what it says could use some tweaking.....,"I got this because I'm a HORRIBLE SLEEPER..... I only wanted the ocean sound, which it does sound like the ocean ** BUT ** NO SEAGULL SOUND in the background.... which I mean, when I go to the ocean and fall asleep with my windows open, I hear seagulls !! But on this,** NO SEAGULLS ** Maybe I'm being picky, but I like all the sounds of the ocean Anyway, didn't even check out the other sounds cause like I said, just bought it for the ocean sound but not loving it b/c no seagulls."
2,Great (when it works),"We've had ours for about 6 months. The white noises is great for keeping our 1 1/2 year old daughter asleep while we make noise in the house. However, the unit seems to have a problem with the electronix on the main board. Everything seems to be packed so tight into the housing that pressing the buttons or adjusting the volume moves something inside ever so slightly and the sound cuts out. We must then press on the housing the get the sound to come back on (it isn't that the unit turns off, it just kind of mutes). When we get the sound back we often wind up having to repeat the pressing several times to get the sound to stay on for good. Nothing more annoying than putting our daughter down, getting into to bed ourselves and then hearing the on the baby monitor that the noise machine went off.I would return the unit for service, but Homedics charges $15 to service IN WARRANTY products, and that basically is the same cost as buying a new one."
1,Far too quiet,"We purchased this item in hopes to replace a fan in my daughters room for the winter. It is terribly quiet and does not drown out ANY outside noise. I was in her room quietly humming to her and I couldn't even hear the noise maker over my humming. Even if you are looking for soothing sounds, and not covering up other noise, you couldn't hear the sounds you want to hear. I would not recommend this item. We purchased the other HoMedics item that is 24.95, (I forget the product number) and love it. I would just not purchase it from general medical (the company sells through amazon) They are very difficult to work with. We got it cheaper at a local Bed Bath and Beyond. (plus no shipping) Good luck and peaceful sleeping"
2,Sound Loop Too Short,"The price, volume control and timer feature on this unit are all great. Unfortunately the loop for the sound effects is so short that the ear easily picks up repetitions, which ends up being distracting rather than relaxing. The sound quality is at the level of ""you get what you pay for."" My recommendation is to buy the Relaxor unit with the dorky crystal ball attached. Its sound quality is vastly superior."
5,weber grill covers,"I ordered two of these weber grill covers, one for my q 100 and one for my q200. They are of high quality material and work great. Just what I wanted. Very durable, weatherproof, bird poo prove, etc. Great product ."
3,Does it keep out the rain?,I got this to protect my grill and at the time I was thinking specifically about rain. I have been using it for several weeks and notice that it also ends up keeping off a lot of dust which is nice. However I noticed that it has a mesh vent on one side of the top. I don't know if that's going to keep out the rain (it won't rain again for quite some time here in LA). Time will tell. Or I might just spray it with the hose to find out.
3,"Perfect fit, but still blew away from our balcony","I loved this grill cover while I had it. Great fit, looked pretty handsome, and certainly kept rain and pollen off of our grill on the balcony. However, I think the Amazon product description ""The cover is fitted perfectly and is equipped with elastic side bands so it won't blow off"" doesn't necessarily apply because ours blew away from our 2nd story balcony never to be seen again (even though I had properly secured to the stationary stand of the grill). I'm buying another, but am still a little annoyed."
3,mostly not worth the money,"This book was a total disappointment to me. Although many reviews said that it was great for reference I disagree with passion. True, there is both information on Role-Playing and just regular Sailor Moon. However, I either already knew or could easily find in 5 min. everything this book told about SM. If you are a GM (game-master) or are really into RPG then you might like this book, but if you buy this book mostly for the Sailor Moon content DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,"Great, but could use more info",This book is awesome and it even goes into detail about from the how many times Sailormoon spins to the history of Takeuchi-san. This is great for beginners in the SM world and I have heard that there will be a sequal coming out. Also they could use more info on the outers and pictures of a few of the enemies. A really god resource for RPG games though!
3,Perfect for the NA fan or those new to the Original version,"This book gives a great detailed of the story, up to Sailor S. It gives wonderful blips of the versions S, SuperS, and Stars. It's also a good RPG source. If your a collector, a North American Only version of Sailormoon or new to the original japanese version or RPG's it's a great resource...but if you know a lot about RPGs and the Japanese Version it's basically a book for great pictures, colour and black/white."
5,Oh way wicked!,"I loved this book! I f you are a true fan you MUST and I repeat MUST get this book! I have no Idea how I got hooked all I saw was ONE episode (I forget which one... It's been such a long time) and since I am Serena(Sailor Moon AND the Moon Princess!) I will quote myself. This book is ""Wicked Cool!""."
5,So much info in this book! Very awesome!,"In the back of the Sailor Moon comic there was an order form for this and I really didn't know what it was, but I just bought it. And I'm so happy I did! Even if role playing isn't your thing, the pictures are great, there is lots of little known info in there!"
5,It's a fun and resorceful book!,"I loved this book! It's a fun game and it includes a resorce section that tells all about the show ""Sailor Moon"""
5,Sailor Moon role playing greatest hit ever!!,I think that this book is for everyone who likes role playing and Sailor Moon. It is a great guide to everything about Sailor Moon
4,Woohoo! Role Playing!,"If you like Role Playing and if you like Sailor Moon, you'll absolutely LOVE this book! Guardians of Order has come out with the absolutely simplest RP system possible. They call it the the Tri-Stat System. All you have are three stats and a couple of 6 sided dice. Roll up your character and assign some numbers and attributes... Now, you're ready to play! Based on the popular Anime series, Sailor Moon, this RPG is a sure hit. I've both played and run campaigns with this book and I've enjoyed being on both sides of the coin. Sailor Moon is a wonderful universe Role Play in and Guardians of Order couldn't possibly have made it any easier! Plus, with all the added resource material about the shows, OVAs, characters, and villians, this book is a must have for any serious SM fan!"
3,Info Info and more info,"well, when I FIRST got this book I thought it was the COOLEST! it has all the info on the scouts and PLUS you can play a game with it. although because of lack of people around who like sailor moon enough to play a GAME of it I used it only for the reference part of it. I even used it on my web page too and it was pretty helpful although, I'd have ta say that the images are pretty shoddy, I've seen them on the net sooo much that its getting oldbut otherwise, its a great resource..."
4,Good for its time,"This was a very good self-contained RPG for playing in the Sailor Moon universe when it came out. Its compatability to the version on BESM out at the time was also fairly decent. With the advent of Tri-Stat dX and BESM d20, this product begins to show signs of its age.In addition to the RPG aspect, there is a lot of good art from the series. My only other complaint about it was guessing the eventual American names of the Outer Senshi based on the names given by the doll-making companies. While I would definitely rework it for Tri-Stat dX (d10) or BESM d20, it is still a worthwhile item for a Sailor Moon fan."
3,An O.K. book,"Everyone made it out to be a great book. I was quite disappointed with it. The pictures weren't really that spectacular. Overall, boring."
1,A horrible book!,This book is completely horrible! It was way to expensive and the only really nice thing about it were the info on the scouts! And even then they missed Pluto! It had hardly any color pictures and the rest were black and white not to mention fuzzy . I give this book 1 star.
5,If you watch no other dramatic movies this year.....,"This movie is a compelling story of modern American cultural society, multiple marriages, estranged family members, and a incredible story of one man's struggles to rid himself of his demons of the past while attempting to save his son from the same fate. The story is moving, funny, sad, joyous and with a surprise stunning ending that shows that if Life is a house, Kevin Kline managed to leave behind a home that symbolized an atonement for two generations of sorrow and anger.IF you live with troubled teens, have children from multiple marriages or have ever found yourself set adrift in the modern economic times, this movie will touch you as few I have seen I the last year.DON""T MISS THIS MOVIE..............."
4,Life is a Beach,"I got this movie mostly as part of my Jena Malone phase, and it had some good reviews.The story itself - a dying man trying to reconnect with friends and family - is bittersweet, and I think it is one you will either love or hate. Most of the movie works pretty well, but I can not take anything serious from a character (the son) who has a Marilyn Manson poster in his room, or wears makeup and has piercings. I suppose that allows me to sympathize with the father.The movie has a beautiful location - a southern California beachside cliff (in reality the former site of Marineland), and the photography is excellent throughout. I did not much care for the music or score, however. The acting is pretty good in general.Overall the movie is good, with a few great moments, and a few melodramatic ones. The DVD has some nice extras, and pulls my rating up slighty to 4 stars."
1,a nearly complete rip off of American Beauty,"This movie could've been great. I was looking forward to it for months. Hayden Christenson was the only bright side to this movie, in full punk attire no less. Then towards the end he became to resemble a logger or something to that flannel clad extent. Metaphores were slammed down viewers throats without need. Life As A House basically took American Beauty, mixed in some Story of Us, and California-ed better movies. The neighbor girl was entirely unbelieveable.The movie still has potential to be great if you get rid of the script and start over, get a new director and camera man (due to the excessive montages), keep hayden as the punk but don't de-punk him and keep the mother, but lose everyone else and the origional footage."
1,Terribly primitive and poorly sentimental,My title reflects my opinion. If you are not a soap opera lover and value real cinema then forget about this - spare your nerves. A sentimental Hollywood melodrama with faceless music sawing your nerves throughout the entire movie (it doesn't stop !!!).
1,amazingly depressing,"If your up for a sad, spirit killing, depressing, downer of a movie, than have a ball with this one. I haven't seen this much crying in one place by so many people at one time sinse the twin towers came down on the 11th. What a great holiday movie.NOT!! The acting was good but the story was a total downer. Devorced guy looses everything meaningfull in his life including his son only to find out he is going to die of cancer. My idea of a good movie isn't about watching some poor guy whose about to die spend his last few days trying to make up for all the things he didn't do in the past. Is there not enough depressing stuff going on in the real word these days. My opinion this holiday, do yourself and your soul a favor, go see a happy, fun, uplifting movie."
5,Wonderful,"A person walks away from this movie thinking how lucky he or she is to just be alive! Bravo! Kevin Kline's best performance except for ""Sophie's Choice."""
5,Layers of inspiration,"One of the most outstanding films I've ever seen. All actors perform perfectly. One large project bringing a family, son and father, father and mother, and so on together. From begining to end, non-stop face paced dialogue, will always leave a mark in my heart."
4,"Interesting and sad, Good story to tell","Life as a House is a very contemporary movie, with its upbeat and also a sad plot to it. With Kline's character waiting to die for the entire movie almost, there are interesting character developments happening with the rest of the family involved, his ex-wife Robin played by Scott Thomas and rebellious son played by Hayden C. The movie has a good story to tell, the rebuilding of a home symbolizing the rebuilding of torn, angry and dysfunctional relationships between loved ones. However, the performances of the actors, esp. Scott Thomas who is as always brilliant, beautiful and naturally talented and Kline whose artistic abilites are shown here, do a very good job of keeping the movie flowing, without it dragging too much under a dark cloud since there is some light comedic dialogue between them. Recommended movie to rent."
4,Great performances in this Tear Jerker,"Kevin Kline gives an incredible performance in this film. Where's the Oscar nomination for him?Hayden Christensen and Kristen Scott Thomas both give great performances as well.This film is indeed a tear jerker. There were many scenes where I wanted to grab the kleenex box. It's a feel good movie.The DVD isn't incredible, but it is good. The director's commentary is very good, and I say this DVD is a must."
5,"""Life as a house"" succeeds with great acting","""Life as a house"" Succeeds where the film "" American Beauty"" comes close with the great acting by Kevin Spacey..I think for most the film "" Life as a house "" allows the audience to come into a house that might be familiar and maybe the chance to emotionally make it through a crisis and come out better..At least, we all felt better just watching the great acting of Kevin Kline and the ensemble cast.."
5,love this movie,"this movie arrived on time, in perfect condition. I love this movie because it shows that even though no family is perfect, you can make the best of it. The father and son re-bond and try to make things right again. Nice story. A few of the the sexual parts could have been left out, so viewing should be limited kind of R rating??"
4,Extraordinary Film....,"I'm telling you Kevin Kline is one of the best actors we have today... And not a lot of people know that... This film even though you basically have it figured out when you hear or read about it is such a good film. Kevin Kline (As Always) gives a spectacular performance, Hayden Christensen Though this was my first time seeing him, he impressed me a lot. And I have High hopes for him in Star Wars. The only thing that urked me a little in this movie (which is why i gave it 4 starrs and not 5), was that there should have been more. In one scene the house isn't built. The next, the house is half built,, you see? It kinda jumps and skips a little too much and they should have spent more time on things like that even hough the movie clocked in at around 2 hrs. So i guess you have to make cuts here and there. But DO NOT miss out on this movie. It is a very emotional and moving picture with a brilliant performance by all cast members involved...."
3,"Not great, not terrible either.","While that doesn't sound like a good way to begin a glowing review, I think that with the amount of dreck coming out of Hollywood since the late 1990's, this really says something. The movie was quite poignant without being clichéd and was able to evoke real emotion without yanking too hard at the ol' heartstrings.Having actually lived through what Hayden Christensen is going through with a beloved family member of my own, it is easy to find common ground with the film. That aside, Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas were excellent as usual and their tattered love affair seemed very tangible and melancholy.In short, I'm not sure I'd watch it again, but if you haven't seen it, it isn't a complete waste of your time."
2,Yawn.,"This is such a silly, over done, soap opera of a movie, were all the good reviews on the movie came from is far above me. The only thing I thought the movie had going for it is the great acting, but thats all. The idea of a father trying to take is pot head son into building a house by hand with him and the help of others sounded like an amusing subbject matter, but I was disappointed by ""Life as a House"".If your a big fan of mellow drama(very much in the caliber of a day time soup opera) then this is a treat for you."
1,BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES!!,"I ordered a DVD. I thought it would work. Being the average consumer I had no idea DVDs were region coded. You apparently need to have a non region specific DVD player. Yes, their page said it's region 2, but how would I know what that means? There should be a warning if its being sent to an address where the DVD won't work. I won't buy from them again. I don't like shady business like this. BEWARE!"
2,You're kidding...,"Gosh, I can't believe so many people enjoyed this movie. This film's only saving grace was Kirsten Scott-Thomas and Kevin Kline's acting. The rest of the movie was made up of good actors with trivial dialogue, or new actors still developing their skills. In order to get the project off the ground, the screenwriter dusted off a cacophony of old clichés and hammered them together to elicit the emotions his skills were otherwise unable to obtain. This movie simply fails where ""American Beauty"" succeeds."
1,Life as a House,"I am rating this very low...the lowest, because, the DVD I recieved cannot be played on either of my DVD players..it states ""The disk is out of region"" I have 2 dvd players and a computer and could not play it on any of them..I have NEVER had this problem before...I am extremely disappointed. No one I know has ever heard of this..It should be explained more clearly."
2,"Predictable, mildly disappointing","Kevin Kline was wonderful, as usual. The acting in general was great. Scenery was spectacular. The house, when done, is beautiful. I found the predictibility caused the movie to be dull. Everything and everyone in chaos at the beginning, everyone and everything perfect at the end. Slight unexpected ending, but nothing really great there. Two sex scenes: one was funny; the other in the shower was just weird and stupid.Can't say I would recommend anyone spend money in a theater for this. Maybe rent it when it comes out. It just wasn't that good overall."
5,This Is One Of The Best Movies Ever!,"What can I say? Great script, great director and an All-Star castMake this movie great. Kline and Christensen are perfect and Jena Malone is a wonderful girlfriend. Not for all ages but a great movie with a very positive message at the end! A must see!"
4,great life drama,"This was on the most wonderful studies of life as we live it.Kevin Kline was excellent in this academy award performance.Do not miss this feature film, it will make you laugh and cry."
4,O.O Hayden Christensen...,"So hella hot in this movie as a goth-punk kid! I love goth-punk boys, so hott...lol but anyways, this movie is a good movie. Jena Malone is in it also. She's a good actress..."
3,Hayden Christenson movies.,I saw the movie newest star wars movie that Hayden starred in and decided I needed to see some other movies he starred in. This was an okay movie. I only really recommend it to women its sort of a chick flick.
4,I liked it,Im sorry But I thought this movie was hilarious actually I watched it with my sister molly and we were laughing every minute. until the end that got kinda sad but Hayden Christiansen was hilarious and Kevin Kline was funny. rent this movie you get a combination of Drama and a few laughs
4,Don't judge a boy by his Star Wars,"It's such a relief to know that Hayden Christiansen can really act, although the film is carried by the underrated Kevin Kline. I won't re-hash the plot, because all the reviewers have done so. I think this film was wonderfully directed and emotional without hitting everyone in the face. The only thing that's really unrealistic is that Sam, Hayden's character, turns things around a little too neatly and quickly. Otherwise, it's a look at one man's efforts to get things done before he dies. Also includes a nice come-uppance at the end."
5,"hayden's yummy, but the movie is still awesome. =)","absolutely an awesome, heart-wrenching-with-a-good-feeling movie. go see it, take tissues. it's a screwed up family film with a sad ending that leaves you with a good feeling in your heart. great acting, issues and events are easily related to."
5,Awesome movie,This is an awesome movie for anyone who likes drama type films. Has a great meaning and a good variety of characters.
4,A worthwhile water toy,"For the price this sub is a good value. It travels a decent distance when wound fully, and it does indeed rise and submerge. My three year old daughter cracked off one of the fins, but she's a bit hard on toys. My six year old son who loves subs had a lot of fun with it. We used it mostly in the bathtub, but it would be fine in a pool. I would not use it in a lake, since it would be too easy to lose in cloudy water. For the price it was a good toy."
1,Broke on first day...Christmas day...,"This was one small toy for my son on Christmas, but it was one that he was looking forward too. Wound it up twice (4 turns each) and it stopped working on the 3rd use. Too bad, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Sub prefers to lay over on its side...but it does move forward,"What a disappointment! This was one of (3) new bath toys that I purchased for my five year old for tub time. All three were basically junk. In this case, the sub falls over on its side as soon as it is in the water, but the wind up motor somewhat propels the listing sub in a crazy arc!"
5,Dive! Dive!,"I bought this sub for a friend on mine's daughter to play with in the pool. After a preliminary winding, we discovered that the propeller spins VERY fast, because it uses the water as the motor govenor. Clever! After winding a bit, it will scoot forward, then dive right down about a foot, travel underwater for a few feet, then come up again. Because of the spinning propeller it forces the sub to list a bit to one side, but it doesn't affect performance and actually helps it travel in a wide circle instead of a straight line. We explained this concept to his daughter, who is five, and she understood how and why it moved that way, making it a minor lesson of sorts in hydrodynamics. The plastic periscopes on top are a soft plastic that can take more punishment than the appear, which is a plus. All in all a good buy!"
1,Hard to wine up,Very hard to wine up the submarine. Top piece broke very fast. Once wind up it doesn't last very long. Wouldn't recommend it.
2,Ok,This toy is only ok in my eyes. flips on its side or upside down. My sons lost interstest in this toy after one bath.
5,Reminds me of my childhood,"When I was a boy one of my favorite toys was a submarine that would actually dive and resurface. When I saw this I immediately ordered it for my 7 year old grandson and he loves it. It has, so far, stood up to the abuse that only a lively boy can deliver and it is still working great. It shares his bath every night and he is looking forward to taking it to the local swimming pool this summer. A great toy and a good price."
2,Bad quality toy,"Worked a few a few times, maybe for a week, and then it stopped winding. Definetly Not worth the money."
3,Cool toy but not for 2 year old,Daughter got nicked by the propeller when she picked it up out of the water while it was still spinning.She is now scared of it.
2,bath tub toy... doesn't work very well,"I bought this for my son as a bath toy. The propeller works, but it's hard to wind and keep it going. It looks good and he'll just play with it without it being self propelled."
1,Broken,This item is not even worth a dollar from a dollar store... my son was able to wind it up twice before it broke and was no longer opperable. It is cheap but not cheap enough to risk the disappointment.
4,New firmware a vast improvement,"Shuffle mode and windows media support (and the fast forward works now)! And I am not seeing lockups anymore either... If it wasn't for the cover problem, this unit would be almost perfect. I use ""FortyTwo"" to upload videos on the mac side and it works well (this is a shareware program)Overall it's a great player for the kids who lust after my iPod+Video and only 1/3 the price."
4,ok but hard to put a moive on it,i bought this almost a year ago. when i first started i had a hard time putting stuff on it but i got the hang of it.the bad part of it is you have to use mp4s you have to use the software that comes whith it to change it to an mp4. the sceen is very big.i like that it has two head phone jacks. hope i helped you buy this
3,South Dakota - From the ground up.,"This is a dandy capsule history of South Dakota development. Using basic family stories, author Davis sketches the development of one small segment of South Dakota from immigrant soddy to motorcar racing to modern class reunions. Along the way he provides a snapshot of comic hardships and truimphs of hardworking Swedes who settled this treeless country of hard winters and hot summers. From blind mules to racecars to chicken stealing skunks, family stories provide insight to daily life on the prairie and progress to the present. Much of the book centers around Redfield, a small rural town and home of the author's wife, and one section provides details of Swedish meatball delights and Lutefisk. Lutefisk being a dish only appreciated by dyed in the wool Swedes.Author Davis concludes the book with a cook's tour of South Dakota, providing useful information and tips for touring the countryside.A delightful book highly recommended for history buffs."
3,Women's 5 or Men's 5???????,If only the description was more specific. Is this a men's or women's size 5. Perhaps some measurements would help? Come on!!!!!!!!!@!
4,Great,"great value! fit well, I listed to other's recommendation to round the size down, (I normally take a 10.5 ee shoe, bought a size 10 boot), and it fits comfortably, very satisfied with fit & overall quality!"
3,Seem rugged,"They are sized large. Other reviewers are correct. I have only had for a month... time will tell... if they dry-rot or crack in a year or two I will repost. Metal toe rubs on one foot... so, wearing for too long is uncomforable. For the price it is a decent muck boot."
5,Great boots!,I wear men's size 10 shoes and bought size 8 boots after reviewing the customer feedbacks. They fit perfectly and easy to put on or take off. I use them to walk in the little creek in front of my house. I highly recommend them!
3,massively oversized!,"I ordered two pair, sizes 7 and 10, for my wife and me. Even the size ""7"" was too large for me! so we're returning the ""10""--I'm keeping the ""7""--and going to try a ""5"" for her. Of course, each time have to pay shipping to ""try"""
5,"Not Used yet, but seem great","On-time delivery, and arrived in great shape. Smelled a little chemically because of the rubber but walked around the house and seemed to work great. Once rain comes tomorrow, I will know for sure :P If you don't hear from me assume that they worked as good as they were supposed to. This was a purchase for my fiance and thus far he seems satisfied. Men don't usually get that impressed or excited about shoes :P"
4,boots,Tingley boots are the gold standard in gum boots. I am pleased with the boots--I do wish there were a bit more room in the shaft for tucking in heavier pants during the winter months.
2,very heavy,"ordered this since i was not sure I wud b around to pick it and wanted it for a trip & as feared, it did not arrive before the trip. It is however quite heavy.. way too heavy to use for any normal use. but went for a cheap one because of the uncertainity. Didnt want to return since the cost would outweigh the purchase!"
4,Rubber boots,These fill my needs very well; I needed a heavy/protective kind of rain boot and these are doing the job very well.
5,Fits perfect,"Boot fits perfectly with some wiggle room at the toes. I wear size 9.5 but ordered the 9 hoping it wouldn't be too small. I plan on using these around the house for a lot of yard work, concrete cementing, and pressure washing so I got the one with steel toes. For the price it's worth it."
3,Boots run big,"I read the previous reviews, they said the boots run big. They do. I wear size 10 Mens, and purchased size 9mens. The boots are too big in the feet, but the tops are too small for my LARGE tree trunk calfs. But a few pairs of socks and some trimming down, and the will serve perfectly for the southern afghanistan rainy winter."
2,Low end and odd fit,"It seemed like a good price for a steel toed rubber boot, but this one's just too cheap. There's no lining and a really low-end sole insert. More importantly, the sizing is unusual. Unlike other comments that complain the boot is too large, I ordered a size up from my actual shoe size and discovered that while the sole was fine, the calf was way too tight. For rubber boots you want to be able to tuck jeans, etc. INSIDE the boot to keep them dry/clean, and you can't do it with this one. It's WAY too small in the neck, and with no lining, you're just going to rub your leg raw on the inside."
3,Great quality - poor sizing,My son for whom I bought the boots wears a pretty predicatable size 9. The size 9 I received was at least the equivalent of a size 10 or 11. How about providing a sizing chart of some type?
3,Solid Rubber Boot,"These boots have held up well. They have a steel toe for safety. I lowered the rating because I have to wear socks with these boots or they tear up my ankles. This was not the case for boots I bought in the past from local places.These boots do not leak and I have used them for a couple months. They do still smell, which was not the case with my previous rubber boots."
2,Depends what you need it for,"I returned these. My husband hated these as soon as he saw them. They were advertised as rain boots. These boots are way too heavy to wear just in rain. I could see these being good boots to work in if this type of gear is required. But definitely don't buy this if you're just looking for rain boots. There are better, lighter boots out there. It's heavy just picking them up, I can't imagine walking in these. Another note is that the sizing is off. These boots run very big! The plus is that it shipped out pretty quickly."
3,Too big,I bought these for a trip to the amazon. They are high quality. But size ten is more like a size 12.
5,As advertised,These boots were ordered as part of an emergency response kit. Delivery was timely and the boots were still in the original packaging. Hopefully we will never have to use them but if so they will ensure personnel safety.
2,"Great voice, but who wrote those songs?!?","Hayley Westenra has a very beautiful voice, and I honestly didn't know what to expect from this cd. The real reason I bought the cd was for the Ave Maria, which is my favorite song on the cd. But when I loaded this cd on my Ipod that was the only song I put on. This cd was just too much for my mental ""sweet tooth."" Singing about ice cream castles and angels, it makes me ask the question to whoever wrote that crap: what world are you living in? Are you here, on Earth?"
1,Boring,"I was hoping this would be at least as good as Pure I loved so much but this is just a huge step backwards. Every song has a nasal sound to it. I wanted to cry it was so below average, so blase. My sister has a better voice.Each song was more boring than the next. It took effort, real effort just to listen to them. Im so depressed.I kinda liked Both Sides Now and even then she sorta butchered that one, to. It made me sad cause I know she had a good voice before. I dont know what happened to it as its not the same as it was on Pure.I like Hayley Westenra. I only wish I liked Odyssey. It is a major disappointment.Heres hoping the next one returns to the greatness of Pure."
2,Bad Covers Honey!,"Don't get me wrong, Hayley is alright. She has a pretty voice in all, but doing an album of almost all covers?? NO!! Sarah Brightman did a totally better job on ""What You Never Know"" & NOBODY can do covers of Joni Mitchell. Hayley, honey, WRITE YOUR OWN STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It's not 'Pure',"As I said in my comments about Pure, I am hooked on Hayley. This cd did nothing to change that. My opinion is that Pure showcased her vocal talents much better than this one. This is tough for me because I know very little about all the technical aspects of the music world, as some of the other reviewers allude to. On some of the numbers it seemed as if she was competing with the instruments. On others it seemed as if the songs didn't lend themselves to her talents, I felt as if she had to restrain herself to stay within the limits of the song. I do know that I cannot drive and listen to Pure, as her voice totally captivates my mind and diverts my attention. With this cd, I can drive with no problems."
5,"So Crisp, So Clear, So Refreshing","I ordered this cd because it was reccomended to me by Amazon. This gal has a fabulous voice. I was expecting more enya-ish music, but it is very different. She has a vocal range that reminds me of Sarah Brightman, but sings in a more lullaby-ish manor. Parts of the cd take an operatic tone and yet others take a little more of an upbeat tone. I was amazed to hear the variety and can't wait to hear more!"
3,Beautiful voice but disappointing album,"This is disappointing following the release of Pure and the DVD concert which Hayley gave us. I can only enjoy 3 or 4 of the songs, but the album as a whole is too slow and mellow. I'm sure if they'd bought the rights to and reissued Hayley's self-titled 2001 CD and released it to the world, the music would have been much better than what was produced. This is not a criticism of Hayley, for she has one of the most beautiful voices in the world today, but rather of the producers who couldn't come up with a much better selection of songs and arrangements for her. I really do hope that her 2001 albums will be reissued for the world at a much more affordable price ($35-40 is a bit much...). I look forward to hear what albums Hayley will do in the future."
3,"Lovely voice, dull arrangements","None of the songs on this album are actually bad, but there is nothing memorable either. Somehow the producer has managed to make a diversity of classical, pop and folk music sound almost exactly the same. By half way through I was willling it to end.On the plus side her voice has matured and she is clearly capable of attaining greatness.After the stunning Pure and her earlier New Zealand albums, this has been a let down, and she badly needs better producers and arrangers, and better guidance on song selection."
1,"Well, some of it is correct...",Not much to say except the bulk of this guide is wrong. Someone's even written a FAQ on GameFaqs.com to correct all the errors that are in this guide!Recommendation: Avoid.
1,Not worth it,"this guide is not worth it. if you are thinking of buying it. please dont. I play the game online, and I am more than willing to suply people with information when they ask. I have over 500 hours of experience, on this game, so I know what I am doing..but I have played with some people that were new to the game and had this guide...and it was more annoying to me than helpful to them. a lot of the information is bogus. its better to just ask for help then to think you know what you're doing and have someone get mad at you. take my advice. its not worth it:)."
3,Greek 101,"This is an excellent introduction to basic Greek for the busy traveler. I liked seeing and hearing the words both in print and spoken by Greek speakers. I also have the Pimsleur DVD set, which is better for really using the language, but takes a lot longer and lacks visuals.Unfortunately my ""Greek 101"" DVD is defective. It stops after the word ""Today"" in level 1 and breaks up; losng the audio in the numbers section. I think it would be great if it worked. It makes me wonder if I recieved an old used copy by mistake."
5,I love this,Its sharper than i expected it made my work feel so good its like using a razor to finish liining
5,One of the top books of all time,"Memmi captures the contradictions and destructive forces of colonialism from an individual perspective, but more importantly he provides us with a work that transends his subject matter and allows for greater understanding of the manner in which structural and institutional forces of other forms of oppression and inequality affect us today. A classic statement pertaining to the human condition and the potential for liberation."
5,Book,Thank you so much for this book. This was a nice smooth transaction and he shipping was quicker than I expected. I received the book in time and I look forward in ordering something from you again in the future if I need something. Thanks.
2,The Urban Poor,"This is a necessary reading for those working with urban poor families in their neglected communities. Memmi described how the circumstances of the colonized molded the way these people see themselves, interact with each other and the subsystems that intrude in their lives. This almost similar to the conditions of the urban poor who has to live in segregated communities where poverty is the main resident.Carlos Juan Sanchez, MACARLOSJUANSANCHEZ.COM"
3,Don't count on it,"Out of three cats, two of them don't mind the collar, and so far it's still on them. However, winter is not over, and they are not outside scrapping and doing whatever cats do.Chester, the fatty, sits back on his hind legs, reaches-up with his paws and yanks the collar off. He has done this 3 times, so it's not working for him"
5,Excellent value!,"This toolbag offers great value for the price. It's certainly as good as some I've seen at Sears for about twice the cost. It has a few pockets inside to keep smaller tools from getting lost on the bottom of the bag and 10 or 12 on the outside to keep more often used tools at easy reach. There's also a handy strap for holding rolls of electric or teflon tape. The zipper seems quite heavy-duty, as does the padded shoulder strap (both of which I never use). The John Deere logo is on the outside pocket flap. Made from a heavy canvas-type material, this is the best toolbag I've ever owned and at this price is a real bargain."
3,Not for all cats,"This medicine was listed as ok to give to cats. After giving the first dose, our cat had a severe reaction. Lethargy, breathing difficulty, vomiting, eye dilation, and foaming at the mouth were the symptoms exhibited. Please use caution when giving this medicine to cats."
3,#1-6 & #7-16 Like Night and Day,"This is a curious album, it seems like she had 2 different producers; one who told her who to be and one who let her be her. The first 6 songs on this album are pretty weak ball-grabbing ""I'm the jawn"" fare, and you just don't get the feeling she really is into all the bravado she is spitting. The second half is a different story, and tracks 7-16 as a whole make a 4 star album. There are still a couple flat tracks, but you can't expect every song to be a hit. From 7-16, I compare this to lady dynamite's debut album, and I will be buying her sophomore album.I do wonder though, why they even included the trash in the beginning when they could have had a 10 song album by only keeping 1 or 2 of the weak early tracks."
4,For Safety's Sake....Buy this Attachment!,"The Microplane graters are an absolute must-have in any kitchen. Cheese simply disappears into fluffy mounds within seconds. BUT...the sharpness of the blades creates a potential safety hazard. If your fingers come into contact with the blades, count on receiving a nasty cut. The slider attachment is a small price to pay for security.Hard cheeses and nutmeg are very easy to grate with the attachment although as a previous reviewer noted, you must use small chunks. The results will impress you. Soft cheeses however, are a little harder to grate. The cheese tends to mash against the blade unless you apply the right amount of pressure and keep up a steady grating motion. It will however, produce finely shredded cheese.That is a mere quibble with the attachment. It will 'complete' your Microplane grater set and you can confidently and safely use this remarkable product."
3,average dvd,I was not entirely impressed with this DVD. It is the standard fare of Playboy's playmate calendar. My disappoint with this DVD may have something to do with my lack of enthuthiasm for the women in this DVD.
5,Buy this one for Bingo alone!,"This is the best yet of the Mind's Eye series. The video quality on many of the animations are very crisp, unlike previous releases and the quality of the work is generally better than the most of the previous releases. While this collection still contains the prerequisite cheeseball student projects and Pixar parodies, the real shining star in this collection is the multi-award winning surrealistic Bingo by Chris Landreth and Alias/Wavefront. Even if this collection contained only this one animation, it would be well worth the price for any animation fan. Bingo was animated during the development process of Alias Maya and it was clear that Landreth and Co. aimed to show off what their new software could do. The attention to detail is stunning. All I can say is Landreth RULEZZZ! Other animations I liked are Pets (a hilarious animation done in the style of Nick Park's Creature Comforts), Vache Folle, The Persecution, and a few others which I can't remember right now."
4,Get this one for the kids,"My kids love this DVD for the cute animation and characterization. For example, there is a segment takeoff on rock, scissors, paper where they come to life and try to get eachother. No, it doesn't break and new ground in computer animation, with the exeption of Bingo, but it is among my kids favorites and I reccommend it for that genre."
3,"Coffe, tea or me?","A few sexy models--would be starlets--wear sexy stew uniforms on board a plane, and have some adventures on the ground. Not bad, there is a suggestion of a plot that keeps it almost interesting. Uninspired direction and plot make it less than awesome."
1,Elegant tables?,"Technically sufficient, however, for inspiration purposes it is sorely lacking. Take a sneak peek before making a purchase to be sure you will get some benefit from the content."
2,pretty weird,It turns out that our character's romantic rival is his dad? Can I return this? It's a bit too sick for me.
4,"Product review, not movie!","I mostly read written reviews in order to get some info on the product itself, i.e. picture/sound quality, aspect ratio, bonus materials, bugs and problems, etc. So I hope this review might be of help.The picture is good, although definitely not the best copy was used for this edition. Unfortunately, the frame cuts some of the picture at top and bottom, just like on the italian DVD (CVC edition, although the excellent VHS tape reveals the whole picture!). I would like to mention the english subtitles as the advantage of this edition though. Bonus interview with Tinto Brass is always welcome, just as in this case. Interesting, especially for those interested in his creative work.As for the movie itself - it is simply great!Subjective resume: worth paying money for the uncut edition."
3,Italian Pastry,"So, you like Italian films that are short on plot but long on nudity?Buy this DVD used and you won't be disappointed."
4,it was fine,it worked and arrived on time time time time time time time time time time time tiime time time time
2,Proved Myself a Voyeur,"Possible but unlikely sequence of events. Beautiful women, a rather stupid man. If this is how we come across with the women of the world, heaven help us. The scenes with the ""black"" woman and her lover were worth the price of the DVD."
3,Pretty women and a bit of a story too!,"This wasn't too bad, but it won't stretch your mind too much. Perhaps the biggest surprise is how the nurse keeps what little cloths she has on. Overall it is a dumb movie and I wouldn't pay for a ""new"" copy again. Oh year, the lesbian sex (soft core to the max) was not too bad either."
3,Good product,"These foam inserts are easy to load, remove, and do a great job of catching a lot of small debris."
4,"Great book, hard to find.",My daughter asked for this book for Christmas and it was really hard to find. I was excited to find it. I found it was a little expensive but that is expected for hard to find books. My daughter is 2.5 years so I do find the story a little violent (about war) but it will be great for her in a few years.
3,tells the story but for a golden book?,This book does recount the story of Mulan (disney's) but is a bit of a let down for golden books- The story is written for a bit of an older audience than those who read golden books. I have to adapt quite a bit when reading this one to my 3 yo. I bought it so she could get the strong female protagonist- other than princesses- not sure that is getting across though.
2,"I'll 2nd "" Mediocre also rans......"" review","Out of 17-18 tracks per CD- i might have found 3-5 i liked but no more than that.Reggae, especially 70's reggae is alot more of a mover than this pleasant-verging-on-blah compilation."
5,Excellent Collection!,My boyfriend actually bought this but I think it's a great collection! This box set is probably my favorite of all the Trojans.
3,Disappointing after Reading the Novel,"As with many movies based on novels, this one falls far short of Julia Alvarez' written account of the legendary Mirabal sisters under Trujillo's Dominican Republic dictatorship. Though I highly recommend the novel, probably as the best I've ever read, the movie doesn't begin to reach such heights.The story is an important one, about Trujillo's dictatorship of the 1930s-1960s, during which some 30,000 innocent people were executed. Edward James Olmos does a good job in the role of Trujillo. Yet the story is somewhat choppy, the character development is weak, and the story line is lacking the depth and the emotion of the novel. Whereas the novel stylistically develops the characters of all four Mirabal sisters in their own voices, the movie concentrates mainly on Minerva.This story is one everyone should hear, but I strongly recommend the novel over the movie. That said, having already studied the history to fill in the gaps, I do enjoy the movie."
2,Not an great adaptation,"Although the film was entertaining, it was in no way an accurate adaptation of Alvarez's novel. I'm very disappointed."
3,Good story not that great of a film.,"I love the story, the movie just wasn't as good as I had expected. Perhaps as usual the book is better."
4,A fair overview of real History,"A friend of mine who is also interested in History told me about this movie and I am glad I bought it. It deals with a real part of the Dominican Republic's History. Maybe it is not accurate, but it sticks to the fact that Trujillo was a cruel dictator in that country for many years, just as ""La Fiesta del Chivo"" (Vargas Llosa) did. Made in English for the American public, it misses the fact that the United States helped and sponsored all the dictators who ruled in Latin American and Caribbean countries at that time. Somoza in Nicaragua, Batista and those before him in Cuba, Pinochet in Chile, and Trujillo in DR, just to mention a few, were placed in power to protect American interests in those countries. The movie does not portray this fact which would have made it educational for that public."
3,"A little sentimental, but interesting","A fascinating time in history in a rare film treatment. I look forward to when The Feast of the Goat finally makes it to DVD, North American region. This film offers only fair performances from Selma Hayek and Edward James Olmos. A long stay in a notorious prison by Selma Hayek somehow manages to have no effect on her drop dead looks and figure. Still, it's a glimpse of an important time in American (not just U.S.) history that is little known to U.S. citizens."
2,It's as bad an adaptation as they get.,This is a poor adaptation of the book... I mean really bad. The book was great... this movie on the other hand is NOT worth buying.
3,A brief historical document,"I think this is a good briefing for foreing people to understand the kind of life the Dominican Republic lived and why dominican appreciates democracy and try to defend the road to a steady democracy. Although there are some details a little bit unreal, most of the movie is good for it purposes."
4,"not bad, great introduction to the trials of the Trujillo re","Not a bad movie at all. It is slow moving and none of the characters are complex at all. Marc Anthony is in the beginning and Olmos does a great job inspiring fear. Salma I supposed was needed to make it a movie- which is sad. She is just as passionate as she is in Frida. Not much of a difference between her acting in both films.This film is from the Alvaro book, and I have not read it yet, but for those that have not read the book, this film is a great introduction to the horror in the Dominican Republic during that time period. There is some suspense in the film, because you think Salma as the main character dies in the jail since flashbacks are made to it the whole time, but there is a twist. A tearjerker and a powerful small film. It's really not that bad and for a great price!"
2,Smell the posing,"2 1/2Hardly anything past disposably cool bleeps and bloops, MC is indicative of the technical hollowness a startlingly fast IDM cycle burnt out into."
5,Another classic from SPICE 1,"Spice delivers maybe his best solo effort on his 8th major label album (a toss up w/ ""AmeriiKKKaz Nightmare"" & ""1990-Sick""). You can listen right from #1 to #13 w/o changing any songs. Like I say on all my reviews, he's one of the best and doesn't make bad cd's and should have sold millions if he got the airplay he deserves. You gotta cop this one. It has 2 classics, 1 ok song and the rest are good or great. Production is also good ans is done by Spice 1 & Wino (7 songs), and Tone Tovin (6 songs)#1 - 9#2 - 9.5 (remake of his classic ""welcome to the ghetto"")#3 - 9#4 - 8.5#5 - 9 (slower song f/ Tray Deee & kokane)#6 - 9#7 - 8 (f/ outlawz)#8 - 9 (f/ Spade)#9 - 9.5 talkin' bout his nigg@$)#10 - 10 (classic w/ Jayo Felony)#11 - 9#12 - 7.5 (f/ Rappin' 4-Tay)#13 - 10 (another classic w/ a great beat)b.

3,Review,The book arrived on time and in the described conditions. I don't think it was accurately described since I thought I was purchasing the 3 parts of the trilogy and not just one.
4,Great pre-departure reading for all those going to Mexico.,"The wonders of the world and its people were once revealed to inquiring souls through the tales of travelers. Stories that coke the fire of the imagination and inspired others to get up and go. James O'Reilly & Larry Habegger have done us all a great service in collecting these stories on Mexico's culture, history and wonders.The book is logically organized into five single parts. Starting with chosen stories that reflect the ethos of Mexico. Followed by stories about places and activities that fellow travelers have found worthwhile. The third part is comprised of stories by people who have made a special connection between their lives and interests and the people and places in Mexico. Fourth is the struggle and challenges facing the country and concluding with ""The Last Word"" to remind you of the book as a whole. This is recommended pre-departure reading for all those going to Mexico."
4,straight forward discussion,"could have been a 5 star, only if the topics were thoroughly discussed. Although whatevr is wtitten were helpful and straight to the point. It also teaches the software applications."
3,Relax on the 5 stars,"I am mainly writing this review because all of these other people are giving it 5 stars. It's not like it's not a decent album, but by no means is it 5 stars. I enjoy listening to talented musicians, not that these guys aren't, but it is very catchy indie pop.They are grabbing onto the coat-tails of this boom in this genre of music and all of these people have over-hyped the album. It might even be worth purchasing, but don't go into it thinking it's the best album of 2005."
3,the devil's in the details,"while all the trails in this book exist and their descriptions relatively accurate, be wary of the detailed directions and distances or you'll find yourself on a leisurely 4 mile hike only to find out that it's really 14 miles!you'll also want to keep a close eye on driving direction distances as the hiker/writer's vehicle obviously had a bad odometer.in the end you'll get where you're going (most of the time) you'll just have to make a few uturns or switchbacks.carry extra water."
4,Good Arizona Hiking Info,"Lots of good information, but I wish it had more backpacking hikes. In any event, the info is good and I'll undoubtedly do a lot of the day hikes. Good trail descriptions."
3,"Good, affordable documentaries","The Great Events of Our Century DVD set is a 5-disc set, each disc comprising of 2 1-hour documentaries relating to a theme of the past century (actually, up until the late 90's). While the documentaries are well-researched, the fact that each documentary is only 1 hour long necessitates just a very brief touching on the various subjects. Still, the documentaries are diverse and talk about everything from human rights to entertainment, to wars to science.The DVD's themselves are nothing special. Full frame, no special features to speak of. However, the fact that there are 2 episodes per disc ... makes this a decent set if you're a History-channel type. The only thing I wish the set had was what happened in the last 3 years of the century (as we all know, there were a few very signficant events just in those last 3 years), but alas, guess we'll have to wait for the ""Ultimate Edition."""
3,Too Sharp?,"I purchased this because it looked heavy duty and need it for restaurant work. I used to own a regular microplane that is thinner, but I ended up bending the metal back while grating Parmesan. This microplane feels comfortable and has a sturdy rubber surface, but if you need to zest a citrus fruit, think again. The fine spice cutters grabs (can't make a full motion across the blade without grabbing) the citrus and shaves it down to the pith. It works fine for nutmeg and Parmesan. DO NOT GET FOR ZESTING CITRUS! :["
5,Wonderful product!,We have two kitcens both containing complete sets of Microplanes. They are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook. The one that gets used most often is the Microplane for cheese.[Same review posted for other verisions of the microplane.]
2,"Excellent product, horrible packaging","This is an excellent product, but the manufacturer or the retailer put not one but two hard-to-peel labels directly on the grater. Are these people numb? You cannot peel it off without cutting yourself, they wouldn't soak off in soapy water, and if you try to use a scrubby, you just end up grating your scrubby. It earned my ""WTF Award"" for Xmas 2012 just based on the idiotic labeling."
5,Microplane Professional products work,I originally purchased the Mircoplane Professional extra course grater because my old dime store square grater had finally given up the ghost. I did so based on recommendations. I was so happy with it that I decided to purchase all the other Microplane Professional graters as well. This product has been truely exceptional. Cuts well (sharp!) and fits nicely in my hand. Cleans up easily. Stores well on my hanging rack.
5,Works like a charm,"I tried this out right after I opened the box. TERRIFIC! This plane doesn't yield the texture of canned ground nutmeg, but it is fine enough for me, this is a multipurpose use item, and it wasn't as expensive as some of the better nutmeg grinders."
2,Not the greatest,"I had high hopes for this zester. I own a very basic microplane classic zester (model 40001) and it seems like after a few years of use it's gotten a bit dull in places. So I ordered this zester. I loved the fact that it's stainless steel throughout and won't break like the ones with plastic handles. But I find the teeth to be just too small, items kind of catch and skip, but don't slide. I am always afraid of skinning my fingers on this. It's very difficult to grate anything, from lemon zest, to nutmeg, to garlic, which is what I am used to using my old microplane bar zester for. I always try to use this one, but give up and use my old one instead.Perhaps I will try one with larger teeth, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,"Excellent purchase, great value, works well for frozen lemons and ginger roots","Some time ago I read about the nutritional benefits of lemons, in particular the powerful lemon peel. It was recommended to wash the whole lemon, freeze it and then grate the whole lemon to add to anything from tee to salads, cakes, cereal, etc...Based on the other reviews I purchased the Microplane 38004 Professional Fine Spice Grater. It is a high quality grater that really works. I use it to grate frozen lemons and ginger roots. Very sharp, sturdy construction and it does not clog. The rubber 'foot' prevents it from slipping. The plastic slip cover and the slim design are well appreciated for easy storage. The perfect purchase for what I was looking for."
5,Perfect Graters,"I have several of the graters in this Professional design and all of them work very well. The design makes them safe and easy to use, with the non-skid end that rests on the counter or dish as you are grating. The grater does not slip, making it much safer to use. It is constructed of solid metal so is extremely durable with no parts that should break even after prolonged use. It comes with a safety cover, so the very sharp grating surface is tightly covered when the grater is stored. I have had many other graters over the years, but with this series, I don't think I will ever have to purchase others."
2,Disappointing,I am a huge fan of Az and I think he is one the most creative and unique individuals to bless the rap game.Now with that being said Aziatic was a big disappointment. Before I purchased this cd I read what the critics had to say and they all agreed that this was Az at his finest and trust me they were all wrong. This albulm was just too commercial and thats why the critics liked it. Az has always marched to the beat of his own drummer but on this one he just went along with the flow and it dosen't work for him at all. You can't fit in with the crowd when your better than the crowd. This cd just didn't move me at all Az could have and should have done much better than this the man has got too much talent to make something like this. It's not worth going into full detail about this albulm but if you want to hear Az shinning check outA.W.O.L.it's way better than this.
2,What a huge disappointment? I want my money back!,"I just downloaded this album, I know somebody already stated this but this album feels like a P.Diddy/Jay-Z album. Its feels SO mainstream,commercialized,overproduced r&b; beats and some of the subject matter ohhh man. I was hoping to find something like Doe or Die,some mafioso type of hip hop from him. Why AZ? There's only a few good tracks on here,which I recommend to just download a few tracks. Here are my picks:track 5. The Essencetrack 7. Fan Mailtrack 8. Paradisetrack 11. Hustlertrack 12. Rebirth"
5,Underated Gangsta,"AZ has this certain aire about his philosophy and it is confident, collective and comprehensive, that is why his lyrical wordplay stands out. You can tell he is just straight up and to the point and he does not have to step on anybody else's boots, to get his point across. Every since his debut I have always made way to cop when his joints come out."
4,Easily the Best Album of 2002,"Year 2002 was the year of a lot of .... hip hop cds. Well, Aziatic wasn't one of them. This is his best album. The second-best rap album in year 2002 behind Scarface's The Fix. I can't stop bumpin that booty chasin' ""Take It Off,"" though ""Wanne Be There"" and ""Essence"" are the best songs. I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars if Amazon would allow me to. Anyway, the only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because it has one garbage song ""Take Care of Me."" That song was too bad to overlook, but 13 out of 14 songs are bangers. AZ's back!!!"
4,I Prefer Earlier AZ.,"A lot of people think the CD is top-AZ material. Personal preference wise, I prefer Doe Or Die; the beats and hooks are a bit too popish for me (too much singing?) Furthermore, AZ's rhyme schemes are too line by line-ish on the CD; this isn't the same type of flow as life's (...) or his earlier stuff.Still, the CD is top quality. A great CD for rap lovers, but not classic AZ (in fact, the first track is the most reminiscent of AZ at his best)."
5,Another One,"Poor AZ. The guy is one of the best mic skill guys around. He easily puts artists like Ja Rule, DMX, P. Diddy and the Cash Money Crew to shame and can't sell 1/5 of the albums they do. He continually puts out quality albums and can't buy radio air play. You start asking what does a guy like this have to do to get some respect. Well Aziatic is another very good album by AZ and I still have yet to hear his single ""I'm Back"" on the radio at all (although I do live in CA, it might be getting play NY, I dont know) So if you are a fan of hip hop, get this album, and his others, and tell a friend, get the word out 'cause its about time AZ got the respect it deserves."
4,"Good, but it received too much hype.","AZ is one of the better rappers from the East Coast, but he has never blown up like Nas. In as sense this is good, because his rap remains faithful to his personality. This is better than half of the rap out there right now, but AZ is becoming more commercial.The album is good, but not as good as 9 lives for the simple reason that on too many occasions, AZ raps over mediocre beats. The track with Nas could have been better. Apart from these two weaknesses, I have nothing else to complain about this album. One can't complain about AZ'S flows-they are almost perfect-but if he had rapped over better beats, this album would have been a classic."
2,True headz look elsewhere,"I heard from a few people that the new AZ album was really tight so I got a copy of it and was really disappointed. First of all, if you are a fan of the album Doe or Die and its raw east coast beats provided by Pete Rock and Buckwild amongst others, then look elsewhere. This whole album is so commercialized you will confuse the beats for those heard on albums like Puffy's and Jay-Z's, I'm talking seriously wack beats with way too much r&b tendency. It doesn't even sound like a rap album. If you are a fan of played out commercialized bland hip hop then get this album, but if you are looking for that raw energy AZ dished out on Doe or Die, then keep listening to that because it still holds as his best album to date and none of his others can even compare."
2,Gone mainstream?,"When i got the classic ""Doe or Die"" i thought Az had a lot of talent and potential, but as his next few albums dropped, ""pieces of a man"" and ""9 lives"" i slowly lost hope. Every new album that dropped the more mainstream it sounded until finally Aziatic was released. reading other people reviews on this site made me hope that he went back to his doe or die style/rawness and i decided to cop the album. I listened to a couple songs and it made me sick. for the exception of #'s 5 , 7 , 8 which were OK but not great the songs sounded as mainstream as u can get. Overly produced beats, lack of lyrical horizons, an all out dissapointment for real hip hop heads. IF u wanna hear REAL hip hop buy his album ""Doe or Die"" u wont be dissapointed."
3,Just Good Enough For 3 Stars!,This isn't AZ's best album but still good. The problem I have with this album is the fact that you must skip through the Cd to actually listen to good songs. AZ can really blow on this cd though.The Intro is crazy....I would seriously just buy the album for the intro. The song with Nas is a classic song. The worst......Take it Off. Man that has to be one of the worst songs ever made.Overall 3 stars is what this album deserves. If this album went platinum I really wouldn't be surprised. It will just take some time for that to happen. Peace!!
4,People Stop Sleeping on AZ,"This is one of the best albums of 2002. Not to many rappers can have some commercial flava in an album and still keep it real and AZ is one of them. He has some club bangers and some real hip hop joints in an album (which is rare). People seriously gotta stop sleeping on AZ, I hope this album goes platinum."
4,Faith in the Whistler,"Whistler are one of those fine sounding bands, delicate songs, and a precious voice, which should probably have done better out of that burst of popularity that fell to Belle and Sebastian not so long ago. Faith in the Morning is their best album yet, fulfilling the promise of subtle love songs, sounding so simple, yet full of melody and life. The sound of strings with acoustic guitars, builds into the kind of sound which Badly Drawm Boy used on much of his album. This is a fine album, from a fine band"
4,YEE-HAH!,"The Old West is full of legends. And you'll find a passel of 'em in this volume from Paradox Press. Many of the stories spotlighted here are a mixture of American history and mythology. But as the Unsinkable Molly Brown (who is featured in the book) would say, ""It makes for a good story!"""
3,Take it for what it is,"In this format of different short pieces (one page to six or so) by different artists strange stories about the west are presented. Some of the subjects are interesting but others are not done well at all... I suppose a result of so many different styles and approaches. OK as a light read, which is what I picked it up as. Otherwise more of interest to the juvenile market."
4,"Wild, Wild West?","Paradox press adds another ""Big Book Of..."" that shares the same flavour of it's ""brothers"". A wide style of illustration helps the feel of this book, as do the wide array of ""tales"" culled from the period. Nice that they included several not-so-well-known tales. Note: this is NOT a refrence guide, but an rather enjoyable read."
3,Traditional doom metal.,"The Obsessed are a classic doom metal band with an obvious influence from Black Sabbath. This record includes some of their material that had been previously out of print, as well as some rare b-sides and some live recordings. I like this album, but I don't think it's five star qaulity. In truth, this album makes me want to listen to Black Sabbath...who do this exact same style of music much, much, much better. If you like Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus, or Goatsnake, than you'll probably like The Obsessed. I prefer the harder gothic doom and funeral doom metal to the classic rock style of doom that you will find here. Not that this album is bad...just average IMO."
4,About Time,"It's about time Animation:Master had a book this good to help people learn it. It's just too bad that it had to come from a third party instead of the software company. I have started and stopped with A:M for over three years I read Jeff Praires books. I read the manual. But i made little progress and was frustrated at every turn.This book has finnaly explained things in a way that I can understand them! I have made my first model and a simple walk cycle, I even remember why I bought this program in the first place again!"
2,not like the picture,"I only own a few pieces of jewelry and was hoping to add this supposedly beautiful piece to my collection as a treat, but the bracelet looks cheap, the pearls fake, uniform, grayer with much less luster than in the picture. The concept was nice, but the actual item doesn't showcase it. The cost of shipping was more than the actual item itself and returning it is going to cost me another $8.50 so I'm not going to bother. Do not recommend the item unless you can get it for cheaper than 75% off and possibly directly at the source so you don't have to pay for shipping.The items bracelet arrived in small box, a lilac package in a pool of Styrofoam cheetos. Ordered on the 19th, received it on the 22nd so at least it was a speedy delivery especially since it was standard."
5,High quality shirt,"I bought this for my husband, an Englishman living in America who misses football. He loves this shirt and wears it all the time. It's a nice high quality shirt that has washed very well over the few months we have had it. Couldn't ask for more!"
2,Great for a lazy day.,"While the show is great, this collection of music is low key and better suited for a day at home. If you are looking for upbeat tunes, this is not the cd for you."
3,Not What I Expected!,"I love the music on the show, but did not enjoy this CD at all. I guess you need the characters and drama of the show with the music. They seem to go hand in hand. Also, I didn't recognize one artist on the CD. It just wasn't for me!"
3,very indie,"its an OK album.. got to know several new artists here.. however i expected the more rock songs to b compiled into this album. btw, Dove Plan, in season 1 ep. 5 - Shake Your Groove Thing... i think the song u're looking for is Edge of the Ocean by Ivy. =)"
1,Awful!!!,"My husband and I are avid ""Grey's Anatomy"" watchers. I enjoy the music I hear on the show and thought I would enjoy this CD. Not only was it awful, I didn't recognize any of the tracks except the theme song used to lead into the show. This is a terrible CD; one I would consider taking immediately to trade in."
1,Boring,"The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing :("
4,Expand your musical tastes to newer artists,"I don't have the most diverse musical tastes, but this CD is a great compilation of relaxed Coldplay, Dispatch-esque kind of music."
3,Relaxing,"While difficult to recall the specific tunes as to when they were used, or in what episodes, I found the pieces to be pleasant to hear while driving.."
2,boring,"I thought I would enjoy this enough. On the contrary, I like one or two songs.The previous reviewers rated this way too high in my opinion. I was not impressed."
4,Help me!!,Ok. I need help. I am in love with the song that plays when you are in the episode selection screen. (3rd season dvd) It plays once in an episode during a scene between George and Callie. Does anyone know what it is called or who it is by? It is driving me crazy. Please help me!
5,Great Companion to a Great Show,"This collection of songs is great on many levels. First, nearly every song is hit-worthy. Unlike so many CDs, where maybe half the songs are worth ripping to your iPod (especilly TV soundtracks), this soundtrack is good enough to rip every song. Second, it opened my ears to new artists and led me to some other great CDs. Thirdly, the songs mesh so well with the television show. If you watch the show, then of course you've heard all of these songs before, and they come up in the most appropriate places. This CD is a great addition to anyone's collection."
5,An invaluable branching-off point for mellow indie fans,"Importantly, those who sincerely dislike mellow indie rock need to seriously reconsider a potential purchase, however I wasn't much of a fan until I got my hands on this compilation. It exposed me to a great deal of talent. I've obtained many of the artists full CD's (one of the best being that of The Postal Service) and I am very grateful for this gentle and thorough introduction to the genre."
2,A limited number of good songs,"Obviously when you showcase so much music and so many bands on a show such as this, trying to fit all of it onto one CD is pretty hard (unless you intend on putting out multiple CD's, imagine that!). With this being said, it seems as though a better selection could have been included on this first release. The one song that stands out, for me at least, is Maria Taylor's Song Beneath The Song. There are a couple of other OK songs on here, but in my opinion, there are also some stinkers. Although I am not a fan or proponent of download music services while they are so expensive, this is one instance where I would say if there is a song you particularly like off the show, go download it there. Pay for just the one song you like instead of for one you like and 14 other average songs."
2,It Sure Doesn't Remind Me Of The Show,"Make sure you listen to the smaples before you buy. In my opinion, it does not match the tone of the show. I imagine it has more to do with what snips catch your ear. I like maybe 4 songs on the soundtrack, I need to like more songs then that to drop my dime."
5,Best and smartest med show out there,"I love the characters in the show and how they work together. Although some scenes can be a little far fetched! But, all in all still lots of fun."
5,love it,My poor kids. All they hear inthe van anymore is this CD and the 2nd season too. Great songs! I have already started buying the individual artists CD's because of this soundtrack.
5,Amazing!,"The first time I ever watched this show I loved it, but even more I loved the music I heard. I immediately got online the next day and ordered the soundtrack. I've never heard of any of these artist beofre in my life, but I can't listen to this CD enough. Run out and get it!"
3,Soundtrack Okay - Tip for finding all the other Songs for each Season,"I just listened to the soundtrack and liked a few of the songs. However, I'm a huge fan and know that there were some awesome songs I heard each week. Go to ABC's website to Grey's Anatomy and there you will find every song listed per episode for BOTH SEASONS! I'm still realing over Meridith and McDreamy's song played during their long awaited ""dance"" of 2 lovers."
5,"Great mix, feels like the show","If you are a big Grey's fan, or even just a fan of 'chill' music, this is a great CD."
1,"MOJO juicer, works well for a week then breaks and breaks","I looked around and felt this juicer was the best on the market. But... I missed the above review. Mine too broke where the weld holds the upper cone in place. Wrote to MOJO and they replied that the MOJO was no longer in production but would replace it with another model if I would send the broken MOJO to them. Postage would have been $15.00!! The model they wanted to replace my MOJO with also had bad reviews. Heck, for the price of postage I had the upper cone rewelded stronger than the original! Also, sent Metrokane a copy of the welding bill. Worked well for a week then the cast arms of the press mechanism broke in two places!! Correspondence from Metrokane and their lifetime guaranted product has been slow."
2,strangler's wife,"I bought this because Constantine Maroulis was in it. If that's why anyone else is buying it, then don't bother. He is in it about 10 seconds. And I had to rewind a few times to realize it was him. He looks totally different, with short hair! Otherwise the movie itself was alright, but probably will never watch it again."
2,No Plot,"It was so hard to follow this movie to me it was like a student film but I couldn't be sure.I couldn't really hear or follow the script,but eventually close to middle of the movie to the end it began to get a bit better.Different and odd type of movie if you like a movie with consistent strangling going on,lol."
2,A bit of a mess,"I finished this book very uncertain as to what had happened. An alien culture obsessed with TV, a giant mutant spider-alien assassin, forced labor camps, and a faded celebrity straight out of ""Sunset Boulevard""--just what was going on here? Couple that with a mostly ineffective Doctor (and his clone) and a confusing 1st Doctor reference."
1,2 sets were both defective!,"The first set I received looked great, but I could only remove the lid from one of the shakers. I returned that set and received a replacement set, and I couldn't get the lids off of either shaker!I am now requesting a refund."
1,Complete Junk,"Two reasons not to buy these. First you have look VERY CAREFULLY at the tops to see if they read ""P"" or ""S"". Secondly - you can't remove the tops. On my first fill the tops removed easily but that was the first and last time for the salt shaker. Even with a strap wrench I have not gotten the top off the salt shaker again. Who can imagine a company that makes a salt shaker that can't be refilled?"
5,Mandarin Chinese 101,"This dvd is great! Not only do the two instructors speak the words/sentences both slowly then normally, but the anglicized words are shown on the screen. The sentences are very basic and should be helpful for a first-time visit to the People's Republic of China. Seeing and hearing a dvd is much, much better than just listening to a cd while reading a book."
4,A fair introduction to Chinese phrases,"This is a video upgrade from the old cassettes where you hear the English phrase once and the phrase in your new language once or twice. The video update does, however, make the language a little more alive. And there's a handy little card to study from. However, it's worth remembering that there's no such thing as a silver bullet for language learning. If you keep watching this till you're tired of it - and you can take 7 or 8 viewings - you'll have a useful stock of phrases for everyday situations. Used in combination with a couple other similar systems like In Flight from Living Language, the Rapid System from Earworms or (best) a Pimsleur intro, this will help you build the barest survival Mandarin for a short trip."
2,No difference in comfort.,"Dr. Scholls inserts are better, cheaper and you get more for your money. I could't feel any comfort in the weight shifting effect."
4,Very happy,"I just received these yesterday, and after only 1 hour of wearing them this morning I'm very happy. I feel a difference, and after yesterday's heels, today my feet are definitely thankful."
1,nope,they don't provide support and are a waste of my money. I much prefer superfeet or just shoes with better support.
5,Worth its weight in gold.,"I forked over 15 bucks at the book store for this book and it has saved me at least $1000 easy. This book takes you step by step through the car buying process, starting from how to pick the right car for you to how to get financing. With the help of this book I went from a weakling buyer willing to pay near MSRP to a well informed and confident car buying heavy weight champion! It's a great feeling knowing you got a great car at a good price and that you did it yourself."
5,Doing Something Right CD,"I love this CD because of the Title song, Doing Something Right.Never get tired of listening to it. It also has a lot of good songs on it."
4,Great Artist,"I am very happy with this CD I bought it specifically for ""Good Directions"" and found more songs on there that made it worthwhile in purchasing it. That usually is not the case,but in this instance it was (thankfully).I think most will be pleased with purchasing this."
5,billy is doin' everything right!,"I love his new cd, totally worth taking time out of your day to listen to. Not only is Billy gorgeous, but his voice is soo amazing. The cd's great, I bought it for the single and am grateful I did, every song on there rocks!"
4,Great voice,I enjoy listening to this album - his cover of Lucille is great! He has a very sincere and pleasing voice. Almost every song on the entire album could be a favorite.
5,Awesome,"In one word, Awesome! It's not often that you find a CD where every song is good. This one fits the bill."
1,False advertising with the picture,"Don't get fool with the beautiful photograph of this radio, it dosen't have that pretty peacn color wood in the picture! In fact the radio is made with polywood, so it's sprayed with one coat of cheap looking red-orange color paint, not the highly polished oak like the one picture shows.This product is made from China, the brand is Jwin. I think this seller just scanned the photograph from it's original box, I don't see he could even bother to find out what the radio really looks like. Even if that's the case, I still think the seller should state this fatal difference and provide his own picture in the product description.I order this radio just because I needed for my exhibition, which themed in 1920's New York, now thanks for wasting my time I have to find another radio right away before the mid-May show."
1,"""Piece of sheet""","I bought these 35 days ago, have used them twice, and the elastic band on the bottom sheet just snapped.Stay away."
4,great value,Quality product. Better than you would expect for the price. Fit and finish well above average.
2,IF YOU WANT TO IRON,"I like how sturdy these sheets are. However, after putting them in the washer and the dryer~out comes lots of wrinkles. If you don't have the time to iron, don't buy these. Even the wrinkle release setting doesn't work on these."
4,Scooby Doo's Original Mysteries DVD,"You can't go wrong with the classic scooby. The five episodes are among the best with humor and mystery as the main theme. I loved the extra's on this dvd especially the scooby trivia. I would have given this dvd a perfect score but the music video featuring the occultic hex girls from The awful ""witches ghost"" movie kept me from it. But again a great dvd."
5,Absolutely timeless,"Sure, the gang's attire and vocabulary don't always fit in with the current trends, but these cartoons have been loved by every generation since their TV debuts. I've been watching Scooby cartoons for at least 25 years now, and I still can't get enough of them. Scooby is the favorite cartoon of both of my children, which just freaks me out. This DVD has the first five episodes of Scooby Doo. They made their television debut in 1969, and 32 years later, they are my children's favorite cartoons. There really isn't much else to say. Good, clean entertainment that is appropriate for kids 1-100. The special features aren't too bad either. For the price, you can't beat it."
4,Good condition,Scooby-Doo is just as awesome as it was back in the day! Arrived in good condition. Played well. This show is so cool.
5,Scooby fans unite,"If you are a fan of Scooby, it's a must. It has the original episodes. Without it no Scooby collection is complete."
4,"Love Scooby Doo, Don't Love Laugh Track!!!","I watched Scooby Doo in the late 70's as a kid and loved it. I still do at almost 30 years of age. It's a great cartoon. The mystery, the atmosphere etc. These are all great episodes except the reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is the most obnoxious thing about this DVD.The laugh track they have just about kills the enjoyment of watching these. It is more obvious in some of the episodes, like 'Mine You Own Business"", where it seems like every time any of the characters says a word, you get this cheesy overbearing laugh track. It almost ruins it totally for me. Scooby says hello, here comes the laughs. I don't know, if you can get by this as an adult, no problem. The kids probably won't mind, but some may.Needless to say, the episodes are still what they are and you'll enjoy them for what they are. Good fun.On a side note, I wish we could see seasons of Scooby Doo and not an episode here and there put on a DVD."
2,dissapointed in female character development,"I read this book with enthusiasm, but was dissapointed with the shallow development of the female characters. Why would Finn ever pine away for Sive? While she is mysterious and a wonderful therapeutic listener for Finn, she was otherwise nonexistant. Wouldn't a strong male character need an equally strong female? Or maybe she was just another invention of Finn's.What happened to Finn's Mom? He made no secret about who she was. Seems reasonable that someone would have used her against Finn. I kept waiting for some interesting to happen with this female. Again I was dissapointed."
5,A man's book every woman will love!,"Morgan Llywelyn is rightly called the High Priestest of Irish history. Her ability to call up a dazzlingly beautiful image of old Ireland into the mind of her readers is simply unparalleled. One quickly finds themselves, as if from a nearby ridge or tree branch, observing the struggles and joys of Finn Mac Cool's life. Once finished, you will feel as if you know his spirit better than any who knew him. No fewer than four of my family members have devoured this book and others are eager for thier turn. It was the first of Morgan Llywelyn's books to enter my home, but certainly not the last. She is a true Bard. May her writings be always within my grasp!---K. Shanklin"
1,IT WAS REGION 2- PLAYABLE IN JAPAN,RETURNED THIS PRODUCT TO ENGLAND WHERE IT ORIGINATED FROM...NOT PLAYABLE IN THE U.S.A. HAVE NOT HAD A RESPONSE FROM THE COMPANY AS YET. IT HAS BEEN WELL OVER 3 WEEKS NOW 4/24/09. IT IS ONLY PLAYABLE IN REGION-2 JAPAN!STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THIS COMPANY. CD ZONE UK. FOR A REFUND AS I RETURNED TO THEM THE MOVIE. I HAD TO RATE THE ITEM OR THE REVIEW WOULD NOT GO THRU. BUT I GIVE IT NO STARS. I HAD NO IDEA THAT REGION-2 WAS JAPAN. ESPECIALLY WHEN I ORDERED IT TO BE SENT TO THE U.S.A.
4,Good movie,"Good acting by Regina King & Courtney B. Vance, but this is not Kathleen Turner's & Ed Asner's best efforts. This suspense, romance, comedy is engaging, funny, & clever."
2,Deadly Dull,What a sham; deadly dull cheapie movie. There is dish wash action and dull humor; nothing to write home about.
4,ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!,"I love, love, love this movie! I caught it on cable late one night and I had to find it and buy it. The plot has it all. Suspense, romance, action and plot twists. It is funny and you really like all of the characters, even the ones who may not be the nicest of people. There is a stellar cast with Courtney Vance, Regina King, Ed Asner and Kathleen Turner all in roles that are somewhat different for them, which makes it even more fun to watch. On a rainy Saturday afternoon, when you want to curl up with some food that is bad for you and a movie that is good to you, this is the one!"
2,Not a great sealant,I attempted to use this to repair a vertical crack in a pool skimmer. It was too loose and just ran to the bottom of the skimmer. Kind of pricey for this kind of performance.
3,Murder On The Slopes....,"Being a horror movie and slasher film fan, I enjoyed this movie. With the Death To Snowboarders theme, you expect a slasher movie and that's what we get in Shredder. The film features a group of coeds who retreat to an abandoned ski lodge. When told to leave by the local authorities, the coeds do not head the warning and decide to stay. Bad mistake! Thinking they will have a wonderful time partying, they are soon to find out that someone wants them off the slopes! They have no idea that they are not alone until the body count rises and we see a killer dressed in black who has an axe to grind! This is a good slasher flick with good gore effects. It keeps you guessing as to who the real killer is. Definetly worth renting!!!"
2,Another straight to DVD yawnfest,Oh brother where do I start with this one. A rich spoiled girl who loves her leopard panties gets her friends to spend some time in a restricted ski resort. The place had been closed down because some snowboarders (who are all rebellious troublemakers according to this flick) killed a young girl who was skiing (skiers are the noblemen of snow sports according to this flick too). Well anyway one by one the kids are killed off and we are supposed to be shocked by the twist ending...ZZZzzzzzzWell highlights hmmm. No nudity so that about covers that...Death scenes. We got a couple of decent ones.Rent if you're bored....
3,nice slasher film,"It was a cheesy horror movie, but it did have some pretty good moments, and it was easy to decide who you wanted to die or live, although you don't always get your way in these movies, right"
2,SHREDDER WHEAT,"SHREDDER is filled with many of the cliches that abound in this ominously overused genre. Slasher killer on the slopes who kills for revenge, and particularly those who don't follow the orders of the vacated resort. There are some incredibly funny scenes like the poor girl dangling from the ski lift that no one seems to notice. Brad Hawkins' horrible European accent, whatever country he's supposed to be from. The horrid overacting of Lindsey McKeon; the deadpan awfulness of Scott Weinger. There are few chills and those that do come are highly predictable.Not the worst of the slasher lot, but definitely a sign to leave this genre alone for a while."
3,Fun Horror - With the Right Expectations,"I enjoyed this movie. In short, it is a somewhat comedic horror film of a group of college-age kids who break into a mountain cabin for a weekend of skiing fun, only to run into someone intent on killing them. Its important to understand that the movie is fairly low budget; not microbudget, but certainly not blockbuster funding. So expect hammy acting, not really compelling dialogue, a thin plot, etc. However, I can be fully satisfied by a movie if it meets certain attributes, such as having been filmed in a locale appealing to me. This movie was filmed in snowy winter and on a skiing mountain, one of my passions, so that let's me forgive the underwhelming aspects of the film and just sit back and enjoy a light hearted film."
3,Ok Slasher,MGM put out this pretty good horror movie. The plot should have been a little deeper. The acting was ok. Average kill scenes. Pick up if My Bloody Valentine is out.
4,Lindsey Mckeon is a goddess!!!,"This is a slasher with a standard plot and an extraordinary female star. Lindsey McKeon,(you may remember her from ""Saved by the Bell:The New Class"" or from her current role on CBS's ""Guiding Light""), is the reason to see this movie. She is an Emmy nominated actress who gives a strong, seductive and revealing (not nude} performance that is definitely worth checking out. It's not ""Citizen Cane"", but she is very, VERY fun to watch. Frankly, this may not be the movie she wants you to see her in, but, it is a movie that demonstrates her star potential. She's willing to take chances, she packs some serious heat and she's got the talent to back it all up. I'm sure great roles are in her future."
5,Awsome ne movie,"I love this movie, the killings are prety good but you have to bypass the kinda corny actiung but it srealy good"
2,worked for a year,"After falling in love with this product and trusting it with my valuable data, it has started damaging the files. Now I cross my fingers wishing this or that is not damaged and a lot is... I don't know what to trust now!!!"
1,Died at about 15 months!,"I have backed up all of my pictures on this hard drive and it's a good thing I have them on disk also, because it died after about a year and a half! I'm very disappointed that THIS is supposed to be my backup in case something happened to my computer and it died! Not to mention that I spent $160.00 on this worthless piece of junk!"
5,It is inexpensive and smooth,"Dear Harddisk seekers,This was the cheapest 160GB harddisk I was able to locate of the web. It is around 2 weeks, that I have been using it and I am really happy with my purchase. It is fan less disk therefore is not noisy as compared to one with fans. It is easy and painless to install on XP. I have kept it running for 24 hours straight with constant downloading and it works without any problems. I am still puzzled with the $5 difference between 120gb and $160gb version. Does it only cost $5 more for 40gb more space? I sincerely recommend this to any one looking for a affordable external firewire/usb storage."
3,Good Place to Start. Lacks in Flavor,"This book is good introduction to rice, beans and grains because it breaks down what they all are and how to handle them. So far I've made about 10 recipes and have been less than thrilled with all of them. The recipes lack flavor. Of course there are 366 recipes, so perhaps I chose the wrong ones :-). I have started using the book's recipes as a starting off point and adding my own seasonings to add flavor. It's a good place to start if you aren't too familiar with the products, but If you're not comfortable building off of someone else's recipe, this might not be the right book."
2,Not for rice cookers,"This book was recommended by Amazon with a rice cooker we purchased. I should have read more about it. It is not written for rice cookers, so we returned it."
3,Resource Cookbook,"If you don't often cook with rice, beans and grains already this book will be a great resource - there is a helpful glossary in the beginning explaining the differences in basic beans and grains, as well as how to shop for them.The recipes require no special equipment and very few rare or unusual ingredients, which is always a bonus. Offering a good variety of main dishes and side dishes, the recipes also include less expected items like breakfast and dessert options. Definitely a worthwhile resource to check out and potentially add to your collection.EDIT: After trying several more of these recipes since my initial review, I would like to note that the time frames suggested are NOT accurate. Every recipe has taken substantially longer than listed to cook to the correct consistency."
3,"SERIOUS OVERSIGHT, MAJOR FLAW","The book gives nutritional analysis for each recipe - which does NOT contain the CARBOHYDRATE content! Are they serious? Whether you just want to know the major nutritional information about what you are eating, or (like me) you have medical concerns (diabetes), you need the carbohydrate count! This is a ridiculous oversight, and a serious one. Shame on her, her editors, and her publisher."
4,Best Beans and Rice ever,"Great recipes for year 'round cooking and eating. Includes the full spectrum of snacks, dips, breakfasts, lunches, and dinners."
3,A lot of content i won't use.,Too many recipes I won't use. Well written and i do use occasionally. Poor choice for this family. Will send to thrift shop soon.
4,All that I was led to believe is true,A friend led me to this wonderful cookbook that will help me change my eating habits.It was a great price and was shipped out promptly and arrived in fantastic condition.Thank you for making the purchasing experience a good one.
3,Ms. Beans and Rice,Had some good recipes similar to one's I already have. Presentation is a little stark. I like a few photos sprinkled in somewhere.
2,ho-hum,"The recipes are mostly healthy, but they're repetitive and uninspired. If I had looked at this book in a bookstore, I never would've bought it."
4,Great Book...But...,"This book is amazing with a variety of wonderful healthy recipes. Being a Macrobiotic follower I enjoyed reading it and making some of its recipes. However, when it comes to dessert recipes and a few other ones I noticed that the author has no objection in using dairy and sugar in the ingredients! That upset me really. But overall, this book can really give you delicious ways to cook your rice, beans, & grains!"
3,Not well organized,"This book is not a wower, but, it's ok. Make sure you read the recipes before going to the grocery store; you'll need to find different ingredients that I would bet are not in the average kitchen."
2,Less than wonderful,"Read the recipe before heading out to the grocery store. In fact, read the recipe's before you buy this book! This book is not great.We moved from the Southwest to the DC Metro area. Once I received the book and started comparing what I have in my pantry to what is in the recipe's - couldn't do it - could not even try the recipe's that sounded appealing. And I keep Quinua & Basmati on hand!Fresh cilantro, healthy chili's, heck even fresh beans, much less a variety of them, are just not available at my local grocery stores. Consider myself lucky when I find canned Jalapeno's or green chili's that are NOT pickled. Perhaps if I made a special trip 40 miles to Wegmans I could find them...."
5,makes perfect rice,I only make brown rice with it but it cooks it perfectly and it is very easy. We eat rice more often because it's easy to make big batches of it on the weekends then freeze most of it and eat it throughout the week. I've never been able to make perfect rice at home until I bought this machine.
3,Didn't Care for It,"Not good for reading to child before bedtime. Not enough words, story, substance. We were bored with it after one reading. My 2yr son isn't old enough to read yet, but when he is, I am guessing he will read it once and then be bored with it again."
5,How To Catch A Star,"I bought this for my 3yr. old grandson, I wanted him to become aware of the stars as he looked up in the sky and also how he could pretend if he caught a star, it would be his friend"
3,"merely ""OK""","The colors and illustration in this book are fantastic. The story is pretty slim, however. It's probably a good book for those who want a book to read to small children, but it's not one I'd expect kids to pour over in their own early reading, which is what I was looking for. Though the illustrations were truly lovely, a weak story led me to return this."
5,dlm,"Even people who don't enjoy silent movies should enjoy this one. Mary Pickford and Buddy Rogers are wonderful in this movie. I would highly recommend this, especially at the price it is being sold and also the book that has recently come out on Ms. Pickford."
5,My Best Girl,"Great video if you are interested in silent films. Mary Pickford is adorable as always, and the plot in this one is pretty good too. Quality of the video was better than a lot of silent films I have viewed. Acting is usual for silent films...since there is no speaking, emotions come thru via enhanced facial expressions, etc. Well worth it but again, only if you are in to this type of movies."
3,Get that cork outta here,"This gadget looks space age and will extract a cork as advertised. That positive comment doesn't address what happens when the bottler changes to synthetic ""corks."" The screw enters as usual but when you attempt to push down on the wings the bottle starts spinning. The solution is to hold the wings and the neck of the bottle (contortionists please apply) and press the wings until the ""cork"" comes out. This one was designed for real corks and if your bottles always have such you'll be quite happy with the Metrokane."
3,I would not buy the second one,"This corkscrew is just ok, it has been working but the plastic material does not seem to be strong enough. Some times when I pull the the cork from the bottle, it fells the corkscrew is going to break. Or some how it can run away from the bottle...corkscrew does not attach in a safe way in the bottle....I don't think I would buy another one...."
3,conversation starter,It works. I handed it to a friend and asked him to open a bottle. He had to play with it to get it just right. It started a conversation about real corks and fake ones. I'll use my old one till another guest comes over.
2,"Shauna O'Brien Fans, These are Not for You...","I bought two of these movies (Cinemax Originals) when they first came out in Hong Kong last year. Although the credits list as: Holly Sampson, Shauna O'Brien..Shauna does not have any scenes in this. Her character is in a wheelchair communicating the story through email, and has a total of about 15 seconds screen time..Im not quite sure what thats' all about. The only erotica scenes feature the usual boring Holly Sampson and plastic women who could'nt follow in Shauna's footsteps if they [wanted to]. Even though I would never be one to say anything bad about any of Shauna O'Brien's movies...this is kinda misleading to her fans. Trust me, skip this and stick to her older, more thankful movies like 'Scandal-The Big Turn On' and 'Platinum Blonde'...until hopefully she comes back and makes something new for us."
1,this verison of emmanuelle 2000 sucks,"if any are planing on buying this take my advce don't because r rated verison of porn does not have any trace of what theactical had please to all how love porn don't waste your money on garbage like this or any movie that used to be fun but now r rated please i beg of you if you don't believe me look up hotel-exotica,emmanuelle's intimate-encounters,virtual-encounters 1&2,and pirates 1&2 and see what i mean"
4,A wonderful story of self discovery,"this film offers a unique insight into the world of a woman who feels constrained by a marriage of convenience and realizes that she must personally break free and persue a path that makes her happy and feel more fulfilling by affirming herself as an individual. the sex scenes are tasteful, gracefull,and worthy of all consideration. Particularly those whom, like myself, don't care for anything to extreme nor grituitous."
1,Another rip-off dvd release.,"This is an edited version of the original NR vhs release. Rated R, yet doesn't have as much sex as most R rated movies. Almost all of the sex scenes are edited out, and some of the nudity. Some female cast have their scenes edited out completely. Nothing like a couple discussing a strip pool game, and then the scene cutting as the man sets up the table. Don't waste your time on this, try and find the original on vhs, or a transfer straight from the original vhs."
2,HOLLY SAMPSON,"Viewers may not be aware that Holly has appeared in some hard core productions such as ""A Slave to Fashion"" where goes by the name of Nicholete."
2,An Advertisement for Octagon,"What I noticed from reading this book is that it is mostly a rehashing of Shah's old views and arguments done by other people. Some points are valid up to a point and some seem only to be repeated viscious attacks against all 'Sufi's' who are not related to Idries Shah, his family and his publishing company. Everone else who is not related to his mysterious organization is termed not 'true sufi's', cultists and shallow seekers. This is done so frequently that it is almost too obvious what the author's intention is. It is actually quite funny to see the bibliography at the end of each chapter, all repeatedly refer to Idries Shah and the books his company has published. If someone is interested in Idries Shah, who does in fact has alot of material and idea's of worth to share. Should read 'the Sufis', 'Learning how to learn' or some of his story compilations."
2,A pain in the butt,"This particular label was recommended on an online cosmetic supply store for lip balm tubes. While they are about the right size, these are a royal pain to line up for printing with Avery's online program, and do not stick to lip-balm tubes well AT ALL."
2,Not as Sticky as Advertised,"Well, these lables might work well on some surfaces, but not on everything. I purchased these so-called ""permanent"" stickers to apply to powder coated metal items. The labels peel off--all of them."
2,Durable?,"I don't know why they use the words ""permanent"" and ""durable"" on these. I thought they were going to be polyester (you know - something that's actually durable and permanent) - but they're just normal paper labels."
2,White 3M Marine 5200 Adhesive,"Picture on Web site was for the fast cure adhesive. Received the slow cure, 1 week, adhesive. Adhesive is in a metal tube. Normal calk gun does not work. Difficult to use."
1,I had to quit less than halfway thru,"Wow, I hope I got this for free but I really don't remember. It was soooo slow and so detailed I felt as though it was more about Alice's hairstyle and her singing than anything mermaid related. The author was trying so desperately to draw a fantastical picture for the reader, that I think the plot was forgotten. I read almost half the book hoping something would begin to happen. It didn't. If you love to read magical descriptions and have a pretty picture painted for you, this is the book. If you like substance skip this one."
3,Interesting,"I'm not really sure what it is about this book that compelled me to read the entire thing. There's not really any grand sweeping romance to it, no nail-biting suspense, no pulse-pounding thrills. Even the title character wasn't all that interesting. Most fascinating for me were her three half-sisters. This was a nice read, but I found myself always wishing for a little more - of everything."
3,Little disappointing.,"While this book had some interesting moments...it fell rather flat...by the end of the book, I didn't really even care anymore what happened to the characters."
4,Great read,"I really liked this book. A really great story about an out cast. A fairly quick read, I think I read it in 2 days."
2,Review of Alice at Heart,"What an..odd book.First, the bad things. The cover art is HORRIBLE. Seriously, I never wanted to pick up this book. It looks like something out of the 70's. Horrible, horrible cover. Also, the type is horrible. It's huge. The book should have been half as long as it was because of how big that type was.Story-wise, this was like reading ..hm, a peaceful mystery? I guess. The characters had interesting depths and quirks to them. Their motto really made no sense and the story moved at a snails pace.I'm being generous giving the book 2 stars, and it only gets that because the characters were interesting - but they aren't interesting enough for me to read the sequel."
4,I like it!,"I typically enjoy memoirs and autobiographies, but downloaded this book because it was free. I was pleasantly surprised! It was a nice easy read and the story wrapped up nicely, without TOO much prediction. The characters were all well described and I could envision each one of them. I just may believe in mermaids now :)"
4,thoroughly enjoyable summer read...,"This is a light, fun read which is perfect for a brain escape. Normally any book where the ending is a given is one I don't typically enjoy but with this novel it was just kind of go with the flow and let the story tell itself. Definitely a recommended book, especially for a hot summer day."
4,A Sweet Story,This is not the type of story that I would usually read. I have never really been into fantasy storys. But Alice at heart is just sweet. Alice is a girl who nobody in her town likes. She is diffrent. Her family is one of the big important family. But no one likes Alice. One day she saves the Govoners granddaughter. When they can not prove that she did something they decide reluctly reward her. And then 3 woman show up who change her life forever.
3,Not what I was hoping for,"This book was disappointing for me. I stopped reading it a couple of times. because I just could not get into the story, went to other books, then returned thinking I must have missed something due to all the great reviews. I finally finished it, and was glad that I had given it a fair chance, but did not find it satisfying, or entertaining. Not much suspense in this but lots of imagination due to the mermaid twist. I kept waiting for something more to happen to catch my interest. Disappointing."
2,Sloooooooow,"I think I'm going to have to give up on downloading free Kindle books, because they seem inevitably, to disappoint. While the author has a wonderful way with words, at 72% of the book......nothing has happened yet. The characters of the sisters are still so one dimensional, Alice is so very vanilla and some of the dialogue borders on the absurd. While there is nothing really hate-able about this book, it's not swoon worthy either, if I can't find another book to download, I may finish it. That being said, I'm going to be searching rather actively for another book."
3,3 1/2 Stars!,I found the story to be very interesting. I was glad when Alice's deviously nasty relatives got a small taste of what they deserved. This book was definitely worth reading.
4,Intriguing premise,"I enjoyed this book and appreciated the world created by the author. The love story was predictable and I figured out the mystery early. however, I didn't mind that at all. I wanted to see how it played out. I loved how characters' ""character"" were transformed by information. Alice's parents are good examples. Even Alice is transformed."
4,Great Read,"This book was really a great read. The closer I got to the end, the less and less I wanted to quit reading it, and the more and more I wish there was of the book left to read. I love the home Alice finds and the magical new family she grows to love. Good read."
5,Stunning Magical and Beautiful read,This has become one of my favorite books. Deborahs detailed writing is something I have never encountered before and I am absolutely hooked!

1,Worst of the worst,"This is the kind of oldies garbage that turns alot of my friends off when I even mention Rockabilly, Garage, or Surf. Its the garbage they play on AM oldies radio. Now there is a couple of good ones Fats Domino, the Nashville Teens and the Duke of Earl but other than that this is rock for squares. Its rock n' roll with its balls cut off. Lame golden oldies garbage Pat Boone would have no problem singing. Don't even waste your money on this waste of plastic instead check out the Pebbles series, Back from the Grave series or Lost Legends of Surf Guitar if you want hear what real 60's rock sounds like. I got this CD as a gift from a well meaning friend who thought because of the way I dressed I liked all oldies music. Boy was she wrong! This CD is now sitting a melted nothing at the bottom of my BBQ pit."
5,Powerful Book,"I found Fine Black Lines to be the VERY BEST book or pamphlet I have read. I am an ovarian survivor, not doing very well, and this book has been the most powerful of anything in the last 2.5 years. I thank the author for saying how it really feels. This book has touched me in a major way."
1,20 Best of Love at the Movies,"I made a mistake when I purchased this CD. I thought the music was sung by the original Artists, they aren't. Next time I will pay closer attention.W. Timothy"
5,my favorite movie soundtrack!!!,"this is one my most treatured cds. i love it and i own like 50 movie sound tracks, but this is my favorite. very cool music from aly and aj. i used to be a fan of alisson but not anymore, now im a fan of aly AND aj. they rock together. they realy DO shine the stage and that is mostly why i encoureged myself to see ice princess and to own the soundtrack. good job putting spirit into girls aly and aj. you inspire me and im sure you will inspire other young girls."
4,I like it.....very much,"When I saw the movie(Ice princess), I was so touched.It's really moving.N the soundtrack of the movie is'n bad.especially i wanna recommend track5 to listen!!Diana Degarmo - Reachin' for heavenTake it!"
5,I am very impressed,"I'm not the type to buy very many disney soundtracks, particularly for my children. My daughter asked me to make an exception for this one since she really loved the movie. I was very impressed on this one. It speaks many words of inspiration and many of the songs have nice beats and good lyrics."
4,Here's The Tracklisting,Here is the tracklisting for Ice Princess:1. Reach- Caleigh Peters2. If I Had It My Way- Emma Roberts3. Get Your Shine On- Jesse McCartney4. You Set Me Free- Michelle Branch5. Reachin' For Heaven- Diana DeGarmo6. No One- Aly & A.J.7. It's Oh So Quiet- Lucy Woodward8. Get Up - Superchic[k]9. I Fly - Hayden Panettiere10.Just A Dream - Jump511.Bump- Raven-Symone12.There Is No Alternative- Tina Sugandh13.Unwritten- Natasha Bedingfield
4,Pretty Sweet,"The bottom line is that this soundtrack is totally sing-a-longable and just plain fun. Got a great mix, from the rocking poppy tunes Reach (Caleigh peters) and You Set Me Free (Michelle Branch) to the funky, retro sounding Lucy Woodward, who sings It's Oh So Quiet-- the tune that plays during the recital featuring all those cute kids in flower costumes. Now whenever I hear the song No One (Aly and A.J.), I can't help but think of the film's opening sequence, Casey gracefully skating and clearing her mind on the pond near her house. The effect that song has is similar to that of the song Perfect Day, also an opening sequence song, which is in the movie Legally Blonde. You just hear it and suddenly you're in the movie. Great CD-- perfect for a day out with the girls or just for shaking your booty in your room or flitting around the house pretending like you're an ice skater. Very fun!"
3,I like it..........,"I checked out this CD from the library the other day and so far, I am pretty happy with it! I think it is pretty good. Here are my fave songs on it (and pretty much the only ones I listen to):Unwritten: Track 13. Very Good! ONe of my faves on the whole CDI fly: Track 9. Pretty Good. Not the best, but very good.Get up: Track 8: DEFFINETLY one of my faves!!!You set me free: Track 4. REALLY good!No one: Track 6. Ok. I like itIT's so quiet: Track 7. Pretty goodThanx for reading my review!!!!!BYE!!!!!"
5,What A Great Story Line,"I sat down to ""start"" reading A Change Called Death and simply could not put it down. I finally finished it at about 2:30 in the morning. The ending kind of freaked me out because I didn't expect it. Even though I was tired, I couldn't get to sleep right away wondering if it were really possible. If you like a good suspense book, read this one, but don't tell your friends the ending."
5,A man with a gift!,"Fraser's got a winner here. If you've ever been to Detroit, you have to read this book. His humor and insight about the city, woven into this wonderfull work, will keep you laughing, crying and dying for more. Couldn't put it down. . .and what an ending. Hope it's just the beginning of many more."
5,an awesome read,"a change called death was the best book i've read since 1995. if you are looking for a keep you in your seat thriller, this is the book for you. i've always loved michigan, now i know why!"
1,Very Disappointed,"Very disappointed, these are not the songs you heard on the radio back in the 60's. Save your money."
3,Good for early yo-yoers,"not bad, but hard to control the brain. looking for a starters yo-yo this is the one for you"
4,better than i expected,I got this movie because the director is going to be the videographer at my wedding. It's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Typical girl meets boy movie...until the girl meets another boy. I'll leave it at that. My fiance and I did enjoy watching it. Had some great lines in it.
2,Didn't work for me,I have severe dandruff/scalp irritation and this product didn't help me--at all. I would not recommend if you have moderate to severe dandruff.
4,Works better than many commercial anti-dandruff shampoos,"I've tried just about every anti-dandruff shampoo out there and this works just as well, or better, than all of them. Plus it's not loaded with many of the chemicals in the commercial products."
5,actually unscented!,ever notice how when something claims to be unscented - it's still perfumey?!?! not this!!! bought this for my mom - she has to use products that are perfume/dye free. has absolutely no scent - a bit thick - but so far - she really likes it and is very happy with it. it's very likely i will order more in the future!
2,Good mixer....when it works.,"I can't complain about the performance but it sure hasn't lasted long. We have only used this mixer for just over a year and have been happy with the power and overall performance. However, the mixer will no longer hold the beaters in place. I took the unit apart and noticed that the only thing holding the beaters in place are some very cheap, plastic collets which easily break and of course replacement parts are not available. We intentionally paid more for this mixer thinking that we would be getting a better quality unit but apparently with Cuisinart you don't get what you pay for."
2,Format needs work,"The story itself is just what I expect to get with a Curious George book, and I have no complaints there. The formatting for an e-book is terrible. The words incorporated as part of the pictures are too small to read directly but oversize the pictures so much that I spent more time adjusting font sizes to get the words and pictures on the same page than actually reading. My niece eventually lost interest and walked away. To make sure it wasn't just my device, I tried this book on two devices (Kindle & Android phone).Recommendation: stay far away from this format and select one of the numerous other Curious George books available."
5,Good Curious George book,"My 2 1/2-year-old son really enjoys this book (along with the lap edition of Curious George and the Firefighters). It's a nice story, and George is his usual cute and curious self. I like the large size and board book format - it makes it easy to read at the table or with multiple kids at once, and the pages are easy for toddlers to turn. (Definitely note the size before you buy, though, because a smaller/non-board-book version of this would be better for some situations.)"
5,Gift Vest,"This vest arrived very timely for Christmas and I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality at such an exceptional price. The recipient of the vest also commented about the nice fit and quality and was very pleased to receive this. I would recommend this vest to anyone who is looking for one - it's not overly heavy - just a night weight, and a great vest - at a really good price!"
3,Terror support,"Seems to be a great vest, have already added patches etc. Had I realized before I added the patches, that it was made in Pakistan I would have looked someplace else. Please think about where this money is, or might be going with this purchase, before hitting the ""buy button"". God Bless the USA!"
4,"Great Buy, exactly what I needed, Juca LAMA BIKER!",This vest is a life saver. With all the interior Pockets one even zippes closed. This is cool like when I polish my Bike nothing falls out!
5,Great vest,"What a great vest! I had my doubts about it based on the price, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Detailing is great, sizing is perfect, and it was shipped even quicker than promised. I can recommend this vest to anybody."
4,"Good, basic leather vest","I ordered this vest along with a set of chaps. As with the chaps, I figured on this vest being an inexpensive vest for riding until I was ready to invest in something better. This vest is a good, basic vest that will suit its purpose just fine. That is to cut the wind and give me some protection in case I lay down the bike. For that purpose, it is a great, economical choice. This may be my vest for quite a while.I wear a 48 jacket. The 50 Vest fit me perfectly. I'd order one size bigger than normal."
5,Vest,"I must admit I did not expect what I received, AWESOME! For $23.00 its under priced. I know it was made in Pakistan but in this day and age it happens all the time. If its not Pakistan, China, Borneo, who else will make it at affordable prices, not Harley that's for sure and I buy 90% Harley for my Dyna. One suggestion, If you've got a BEER GUT or are just a little large around the middle buy larger. I'm a 44 short and have a little paunch, I bought a 46 and its perfect. The OLD GUY!"
4,Leather Vest,Great price on this vest. Good fit and with a little mink oil it is soft and fleable. I recommend this to anyone wanting a vest
2,Doesn't spray a fine mist as claimed,These bottles do not spray a fine mist but instead they spray a steady stream. (didn't make a difference if they contained plain water or oil). I gave them two stars because they are sturdy little bottles.
1,NOT a fine mist spray at all.......,i shopped for a long time to try to find a FINE MIST spray bottle to use to infuse essential oils into the air......WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY ARE ONLY LABELED 8 OZ SPRAY BOTTLE.....AND THEY HAVE A SPRAY AS ANY OTHER SPRAY BOTTLE......I HATE MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENTS AND WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN FOR THAT VERY REASON.......
3,Too short of a documentary,I haven't watched the matches on this dvd yet but i'm sure i've seen them all already but i mainly bought this dvd set for the documentary and i was disappointed. I was expecting it to be much longer and reveal alot more then it did. Most if not all things they mentioned i already knew about so nothing surprising there. I would only recommend this dvd to someone maybe to add to their collection but if you are just buying it to be surprised or whatever then i suggest to rent it first
5,If done right! This could be an Awesome DVD,"The Rise and Fall of WCW!First off this should be atleast a 3-DVD Set...At the least! Covering Ted Turner's purchase (1990), thru the ""rebuilding"" years (1991-1993, thru the WWF superstar invasion (1994-1996), thru the ""New World Order"" years (1996-1997) all the way its eventual demise (1998-2000).I hope that the extra matches aren't anything you can find on any other DVD! Focusing matches from the WCW Television shows will really give it that feeling of why you can see why WCW was so great and why it fell. I would say that you don't include any high-profile Pay-Per-View matches at all! All these matches can be found on WWE Superstar DVDs (The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, Legends of Wrestling, etc.) and anthology DVDs like The Essential Starrcade.Grabbing matches from Saturday Night, Power Hour, Main Event, Saturday Morning Pro, World Wide, Nitro, Thunder and Clash of the Champions...would make this DVD a true gem!"
2,A Lazy WWE Production,"WWE took the shortcut on this DVD by using a ton of old interviews from The Monday Night Wars DVD and the nWo DVD, among others. While there are new interviews from people such as Kevin Sullivan, Harvey Schiller, Bill Watts, etc. it comes off rushed and recycled and was a major let down. Those that know a lot about wrestling history know a ton of important facts were left out of this DVD. This might be the worst Documentary that WWE has ever done. It was a major let down in my opinion and I would rather see some sort of indie documentary about the rise and fall of WCW, similar to ""The Heroes of World Class"" where actual research is done and more people are interviewed with less fluff, while being more in depth. This was such a MAJOR let down."
4,Good but could be better,"The documentary was good, but the fact is they used a combination of past and current interviews. If people like Eric Bischoff, Bill Shaw, Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger, and a couple others participated, this would have been a better documentary. Whoever put this together really did not do a great job.Now, as for the matches, it's a sweet list. Flair/Steamboat tops the list with a classic encounter between Magnum TA and Flair, along with a couple good tag bouts. They could have included another (or a different) War Games match and maybe some different matches that were more newsworthy.Overall, the disc set is good. Most of the stars are for the matches, though."
3,"Good Lord, what a let down.","It's not a bad documentary for what it is and what they actually mention. Some decent matches I'd like to say. But talk about a Cliff's Notes version of the history and what all went down in WCW. Words can't describe how let down I really was. It made me want to go back and read ""The Death of WCW"" again. You'll REALLY get the unfiltered, more unbiased version of what went down at least in the final 5 or 6 years of WCW, warts and all."
3,For the real story of Black Saturday....,"Considering how unbelievably botched the Black Saturday chapter is on this I invite you to read the following:[...]Match selection is quite good especially with the two Midnights matches which haven't seen DVD release. If you haven't seen the Great American Bash '90 match with The Southern Boys prepare to have your mind BLOWN.If only for comedy, this documentary is worth watching to see Mike Graham spit some serious B.S. If Mike Graham was as smart as he wishes us to believe he might have been something more than a babyface in his daddy's promotion. The ""Better Suited if it was titled ""The Rise & Fail of a WCW Documentary"" review summed it up very well."
2,Missed the boat....,"They really dropped the ball on this one. I grew up a NWA / WCW fan. I always thought the WWF/E was to cartoonish but I would watch if it was on. This one starts off good with the history and all, but catapalts over the best years which were the 80 and early to mid 90's. Nothing on Sting, Nikita Koloff, The Stiener Bros, The Varsity Club, The 4 Horsemen, Lex Luger , Barry Windham, Ron Simmons, Road Warriors, the Great Muta, Dusty....NWA/WCW had the best rivalries and title matches. They had Good guys vs Good guys which was unheard of in the WWE until Warrior/Hogan. This leaky ship jumped right into the Monday Night Wars which was significant but focused on who ran WCW more than the wrestlers. It also had a bitter WWE feel to it like the WCW was a shithouse. I do agree the WCW fell hard and deserve to be shutdown because of it non respect for thier suporters during the Vince Russo era. Maybe they should do a best of the NWA video for fans like me."
4,Great history of WCW,"This collection is great except for the WWE badging everywhere, I thing some of the more interesting matches are missing but this set does a good job glad I purchased can't beat the price"
4,Rise & fall of WCW Rented Review,"Quick Review: This documentary is very interesting but maybe is slightly negative against WCW as a whole, I really enjoyed watching the clips from the Nitro Monday night wars as it was WCW as its peak. I would suggest renting it if you enjoyed watching WCW or are just interested in finding out more about WCW."
2,Wwe fantasy world,I should no better than to keep buying wwe dvd's once again they distort history and are not objective or balanced in what they show had so much potential but not good enough don't waste your money
2,YAWN,THE DVD SET IS BORING THE MATCHES ARENT THE BEST POITICS ARE PREVELANT (WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE WCWs RIVALS MADE THE DOCCUMENTARY) STARS LIKE CACTUS JACK ARE MISSING AND HE WAS MY FAVORITE WHEN I TURNED IN TO WATCH WCW WHEN I WAS A KID. IT WAS ATRAVESTY BECAUSE WCW DID HAVE THE BETTER SHOW AND THE MORE BELIEVEABLE STARS. NOW I DONT EVEN WATCH WWE BECUASE IT IS A SOAP OPERA/ DANCE OFF/ 100% PREDICTABLE WITHOUT COMPETITION YOU HAVE NO ONE TO PUSH YOU AND IT GETS STALE.
2,"Too much Jim Ross, not enough Tony Schiavone","I understand Jim Ross is probably more available to track down than Tony Schiavone, but TS meant more to JCP and WCW than Jim Ross ever did. Ross has turned into a WWE house boy, and TS was the voice for the promotion for nearly 20 years. It was bad enough we had to stomach him on the AWA DVD....a company he never worked for and had nothing to do with, but he said a little too much, and the World Class DVD for that matter. I am sick of Jim Ross, when he talks about these other promotions, he always has to add the WWE twist on it, how they are successful and how the other companies crumbled. Tony Schivone should have been on this DVD, I always liked him better than Jim Ross anyways."
2,How did they screw this up so bad?,"I went out to get this DVD the day it came out because I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was anticipating the documentary part more than the matches. You can get one of those WWEClassics subscriptions and get access to MUCH better matches than this DVD set had.The documentary portion was a disappointment. A big one.They spent too much time on how WCW came to be, and not enough time on what WCW was when it was at it's highpoint and how bad it was when it died. It's almost like they forgot to include more than five minutes of coverage for 1999-2001. They could've covered nWo Wolfpac vs nWo Hollywood, Raven's Flock, Millionaire's Club/New Blood feud, some of WCW's crazy endings that made NO sense. Instead, they covered Goldberg, Hogan, and the NWO... stuff we've seen to death.Their Monday Night War DVD was much better."
3,"Good documentary, but needed more matches","I thought the documentary part was pretty good, but the match list could have been better. There are some good ones here, Ric Flair Vs. Ricky Steamboat, Hulk Hogqan Vs. Ric Flair, both the sting matches and the Fall Brawl, but there should have been more. Missing form this set is Brett Hart vs. Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan vs. Goldberg, Hogan vs. Sting (I know this was not a very good match but it was a big one for the company...ETC.It's OK if you just want to learn about WCW but if you want to see the best and biggest matches from WCW you out of luck."
4,Good quality,"Nice quality seat, easy to put together... I'm not real mechanically inclined and it only took me about 10 minutes. 5 bolts and it comes with everything but a phillips screwdriver. Sam's Club has them for $29 though... better to pick one up there."
4,A learning experience which translates well to book form.,"Swain has been teaching in the Chicago area for many years. In this book, he walks the student through the process of mastering blues piano. Included are easy to follow explanations which guide the student from the simple through the more advanced techniques of blues piano. An accompanying CD gives the student a bass and drums rhythm accompainment at various tempos. Here's an overall view quoted from Swain:""I approached the writing of this book alway asking: what concepts have proved essential to my own growth and to the growth of my students? With this question as the focal point, the book began to write itself. The exercise materials, solos and artistic concetps are engineered to build a creative facility at the keyboard quickly yet thoroughly.""Within 3 hours of opening this book, I was playing a rudimentary 3 chord blues improvisation. Highly recommeded."
5,Inspired work,this is so uplifting! My kids even love to listen to it. Beautiful clear vocals and the lyrics are so great. It's a must for anyone who cares and loves.
3,Well written but ultimately wrong.,"A misleading book in which under the thin gloss of scholarly objectivity, the very survival of Jerusalem is exposed to adversity.Though smoothly technically proficient, the selection of ""evidence"" is highly militant: it advocates the end of Jerusalem as a Jewish capital and makes enormous efforts to hide the age-old connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem. It balances it symmetrically with connectedness to Jerusalem by others. It plays up everything it can get a hold of to prove that Jerusalem is not central and inalianbly a part of the Jewish predicament. It uses non-evidence very cleverly. (i.e. plays up things not said and mention not made [but possilby taken for granted] by the founders of Zionism and the Jewish State.)Jerusalem will be the capital of Jewish Israel for centuries to come by which time this book will be long (and rightly) forgotten."
3,What I think about this book,"The book ""Hitler and Germany"" was interesting in the way that it had alot of facts in it. There were alot of things I did not know. This book was very well written but it wasn't very entertaining.I recomend this book to anyone who has great interest in Hitler's struggle for power and his plans for a perfect Germany. I don't recomend this book to young readers, some of its contents would go over their heads."
2,Very out of date,"In 1964 this referece was timely and very authoratative. Today, forty-seven years later, it is horribly out of date. I have contacted several of the larger orders over the years and addresses and phones have changed, mission objectives have altered, etc. Many orders are almost extinct and many have such dwindled numbers that they haven't had a profession for years.To be helpfull and of value this needs to be drastically updated."
4,Great product!,I really like this product. I only have to use about a tablespoon for each load in my HE washer. I can use it on my husband work clothes and my newborn's clothes too.
4,"Great for cleaning and no itching, but not so great for removing odor...",I like that it takes up less space and does not have any dyes or scents. This is great compliment to my Snuggle fabric softener sheets. It gets out spaghetti sauce and jelly if you wash within 48 hours. It was not good for removing the chlorine smell from swimsuits used in a hotel pool. For that I used the regular All with the citrus scent. That was great. I will wait for them to make a citrus Small & Mighty.
2,White Men Can't Jump Cut,"Too much bubblegum sticking to these ""Sidewalks"". The characters here, all urban lovers, most seasoned veterans who have been through the mill ( marriage, live-in relationships and divorce ) discussing ever so sincerely whether to have sex on the first date. A 6 year marriage and the commitment implied by a 2nd date have pretty much the same emotional heft here.Non sequiteurs abound. Heather's character doesn't want to get divorced because her mom stoically refused to do same for the sake of the children. Oh, but Heather's character doesnt have children.Can movies be on prozac? There is some kind of mood control going on here. You would think Edward Burns is afraid his face will crack if he displays an emotion; not an eyebrow moves, whether he's getting dumped or if he's getting the all clear signal from the new alpha-chick."
1,Unappealing,"This may well be an accurate slice of (modern) life movie, but it just seemed sleazy. It had no charm or romance. Perhaps, this is what life has become, thanks in large measure to films, etc. like this. Earlier works by Burns were much better. An earlier review likened this movie to a Woody Allen movie - there's no resemblance - Woody Allen's movies, generally, are very witty and insightful whereas this movie was merely crude. Admittedly, Dennis Farina's character was crude AND funny. I found it depressing and disgusting."
3,Hits home on marital issues anyways ...,"Of course, a movie like this places way too freekin much emphasis on first-date sex, etc ...However, the marital issues and tensions hit home with me. As a divorced guy, I am quite familiar with the diminishment of love, the woman's needs not being met, and ... regretfully ... the lies and games of a cheater (even if mine wasn't to that extreme ...). Also with the second relationship, two different marital backgrounds, etc ...One thing I liked, really funny, was how the self-proclaimed hot shot makes all the stupid moves & the woman doesn't go for them ... heh heh heh ..."
3,Ed Burns fan here,I watch all Ed Burns' movies and enjoy all. I love his believable story lines. I would watch all of them if I could. I was on a marathon of Ed and saw 5 over one weekend.
4,A fine homage to Woody Allen,"This film plays out as an homage to Woody Allen - both in plot and stylistic, formal filmic choices of the writer/director.If you're a fan of Woody Allen - it's well worth the view.In all actuality, it's a ""poor-man's"" Woody Allen film done by Edward Burns (and this is not to indicate a pejorative slant on the categorization). NB: It does not come close to, ""When Harry Met Sally"" - another (and major, I admit) homage to Allen!Burns does however, shamelessly rip-off lines from Allen's ""Husbands and Wives""- see Mia Farrow's confrontation with Allen's character regarding the impossibility of him surviving outside of New York for more than a day or so as he's waxing philosophical about an ""author's"" idealized life in the cafes of Paris...That said, I enjoyed Burn's film."
5,great,okay let me start by saying i'm a huge Brittany Murphy fan and this has to be one of her best movies besides spun. I'm very impressed with many romantic comedies but i liked this so much that it's taken over the space where unconditional love used to sit.
2,"STALE ROMANCE, TRIES ON A WOODY ALLEN DRESS, FORGETS CHARM","Overdrawn conversations and inter-twined relationships in Manhattan. Can't get any more Woody Allen than that. Yet there is so much wrong with this movie that makes it an ersatz, charmless clone of Allen's films.The cinematography is (perhaps purposefully) scattershot, cutting abruptly between long scenes. This doesn't really make for the stylization that the directors were apparently going for, it just comes off as epileptic camerawork.Then there is slobby vulgarity including adoloscent malarkey about applying cologne to your pubic areas or forgetting to shower before dates. There is an annoyingly prolonged shot of Ed Burns' armpits.What really gets your goat after a while though is the endless chitter chatter that lacks any semplance of sense or wit.While the movie does have its moments, an occasion or two where you may even laugh out loud, overall it is a disappointing waste of film. Can be skipped unless this is the only choice you have."
5,Best I've seen in awhile,"I've lived in so cal my whole life, and went to New York city for the first time a couple months ago. I was absolutley fascinated with the lifestyle they have, so I had to pick this up. Going through the sex lives of about a dozen people, and in the end they all end up connecting to each other in one way or another. Using big name actors such and Brittany Murphy, Heather Graham,and a few others made it even better. No nudity, which makes you appreciate the actual movie. The only thing I didn't like was that since the story was told through the eyes of the interviewer the camera moved up anddown and wasn't steady or professionally done. But still a great film."
2,Not great,"I didn't like this movie very much. Most of the acting was fine, but the characters weren't very likable on the whole. I watched this with my teen-aged daughter and cringed at the over-the-top discussions of sex--how many partners each character had had (one claimed over 500) and at what age they first had sex. (The movie opens with each character discussing the number of partners.) And we have yet another movie relying on footage shot in New York to seem cosmopolitan or hip or something. Was it terrible? No. I watched until the end. Was it very good? No."
1,Sheet set,"I didn't like the quality of this item. After washing, it was extremely wrinkled and looked terrible."
2,The Color is off,The sheets that came are hardly the color shown in the picture. What I have on the bed now is like a pale yellow. The color in the picture was exactly what I was looking for.
3,2.5 Stars,These sheets match my cream-colored sheets in color. They aren't sage. They shrunk the first time I dried them - from a good size for my mattress & padding to tight without padding. They are a bit thin but they were only $20. I don't find them to be too wrinkly. They are comfortable to sleep on.
3,Review of Queen size sheets,"The sheets seems ok, but they do wrinkle a good bit. They tend to ""pill"" a bit. I was dissappointed in that, otherwise, very useable."
5,Prequel to The Kumars at #42.,"Unfortunately I was unaware the DVD was region 2 (UK) but no matter- laptop DVDs are code-free and I was able to watch it. I'm a big Britcom fan, love The Kumars at No. 42. This is the predecessor, many of the same people, sketch comedy. The cast (for both) are mainly of Indian extraction, and much of the humor has to do with British Indian indiosyncracies (like the couple Kapoor who pronounce their name Cooper) and stereotypes (the Jamaican talking Bhangramuffin teens), the father who insists everything and everyone is Indian (like the father in My BF Greek Weddding). Some is biting, revealing the prejudices they deal with in ""white"" society. The humor is universal; I'm an American of Irish extraction and it makes me laugh!"
5,GET IT QUICK!!,"You've heard of the ""Perfect LP"" side, Well this is the ultimate PERFECT CD twin pack with Grover at his finest.Each cut is a treat in its self packed with sexy soul and hard knocking sax playing by the master.I wasn't to hip on the two Lps when they came out because Reed Seed and Skylarkin was on my rotation all the time. But the recent purchase of this double set(They won't last long in this format, so grab it when you can),Really was an eye opener. Trust me when I say that every song is composed with detail,And have their very on flavor that flows right into the next.They are so seamless, you can't tell when one CD ends and the other begins.Give yourself a treat had buy this set,I promise you will write me back with a big hug and a thanks."
2,Not Like the Picture! Beware!,"I just purchased two of these robes for Halloween, so that my girlfriend and I could dress as Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.The reviews on Amazon were all so glowing that I assumed the product would be great: I was wrong.The first problem with the robe is that the inner lining is not red, it's lavender, or a very, very faded red. Which is wholly unlike all of the pictures.The second problem is that the robe is really not ""one size fits all."" If you are over 5'10"", forget about it. It will look ridiculous on you. Especially the sleeves.Find your robes elsewhere, as these are garbage."
2,highly disappointed with this,"When I received this I instantly got disappointed when I saw the awful colour of the hood lining. The gryffindor colour is crimson and the hood was some gross mixture of pink and red. It was terrible. I can't see why it's so hard to get fabric that close to crimson or burgandy. The vendor should stop selling these things. I gave it 2 stars because the rest of the robe was fine, although a bit wide for me."
4,Great Album,"I purchased this CD a few days ago, and really liked it. I decided to glance at the reviews on amazon and I don't really understand why so many people dislike this album. One review recomended the standards CD on columbia over this album so I went out and bought it. I actually enjoy this album more. It has some really cool moments."
2,No Magic at all !!!!,Let me preface this review by stating that I am a huge Wynton Marsalis fan. This recording simply has no magic. After coming to Blue Note I ahd an expectation Wynton coming out with a classic Jazz CD. While he is without question a very brilliant Jazz Musician who definitely respects and preserves the art form. He simply does not deliver or demonstrate that abibilty on this recording.
3,This book is a warning,"Ms. Mollencott has ignored most scripture and taken what scripture she can use out of context. She has done all of this to re-invent God. She has created a god that fits her needs, rather than making herself a worthy sacrifice for God. She has, as the second commandment warns, created a false god to worship. This book is a warning to all who want to follow Christ that there are those who proclaim to have a ""new view"" of God that is more accurate, except you have to ignore or rewrite scripture to fit the scripture with the new god. This book is worth the reading to see how the enemy works."
1,Yawn................................,"Another book attempting to white wash and justify sin........... Shakespeare said it well -- ""Oh what goodly outside falsehood has."""
1,Vanity Press designed especially for the vain,Parts of the book are interesting. It was an era of rolling up small businesses into big businesses with Wall Street making the first killing and top management making the second killing. That part is OK but already well known. One gets the feeling that the dissembler believes his own tale. A good example of the limits to which fawning and excessive praise go unnoticed by giant egos.
1,Something is Mi$$ing,"Something about this book just didn't seem to ""cook"". I felt like I was scammed. The storyline just didn't add up and I felt like I was taken for a ride. I'd put it up for re-sale, but I'm not sure I would get back what I paid for it."
4,good product,"I was disappointed when this HEAVY package arrived with a strong dent on the top - it was too heavy to ship back for a new part, so I have suffered in silence. The product itself is pretty sturdy - I have weights from 5lbs - 30lbs on each side and it performs nicely. I sometimes worry about working with 3rd party agents from amazon.com, but this worked out pretty well."
5,Fish Coking,Fish are the most difficult challenges for me when it comes to cooking so this book gets high grades as being a real help. A good addition to any cooking collection.
5,It's really brass!,Hard to find a brass brush these days for the porcelain grill we have. This one is of good quality and makes cleaning the grill easy.
