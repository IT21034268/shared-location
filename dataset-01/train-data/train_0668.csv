4,My son said he liked this,"My son said he liked this, he is still using it, it has been about a year now."
4,Great product,"Great product! Very efficient shave. Easy to clean. Holds its charge for a long time. The trimmer isn't much, buy that seperate."
3,LIghtweight razor gives lightweight shave.,"I've been a electric foil razor user for many years. I've always wanted to try the Norelco 3 floating head style razor. I finally bought this razor for Christmas 2008. It's neat and easy to handle. I don't like the fact that you can't plug a cord directly into the razor. You have to charge it first with either the charging case or the charging stand. I also am dissapointed with the time it takes to get a close shave. With it, I have to keep going over my face repeatedly to get a close shave. With my Braun foil razor It gives a close shave on just about the first swipe. This Norelco would probably be a good razor to keep in the car or office."
1,Shaver review,"The grouping of the three blades is to large. The blades need to be smaller in diameter to cover less area on the face. Also, the quality of construction using more plastic indicates that you are forcing your customers to purchase new shaving heads on an annual basis. The shavers you made twenty years ago were of better quality."
2,Nice shaver if you like to pay for new heads every year,This shaver shaves well. But I never had a shaver that got dull so quick. Expect to pay yearly for new heads. I had to switch back to my old razor after a year using this shaver since this one would not cut anymore. I've looked to buy the heads locally and haven't found anybody who stocks them.Bottom line. I would not recommend this shaver unless you like to throw money at it every year. It is like buying a printer and end up paying a lot of money for constant ink refills.My previous shaver is a Norelco too. Much more durable.
3,ALL LOOKS VERY LITTLE ACTION,"I have been hearing lots of really good things about this new razor Norelco has advertised. It looks good but so far I have noticed very little action. The best part is that the razor head angles, the worst part is the trimmer. It's awful. What ever happened to the older heavier models with a great trimmer and heads that delivered a great shave and the motors were powerful? I guess those days are gone forever.I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR, IT'S ALL HYPE!"
1,Disappointment,"I have used Norelco shavers for over 40 years. When my last razor wore out, I decided to go for the highest price model and ordered this model. What a disappointment. I used it for three months and was totally unhappy about how many times I had to go over and over and press HARD to get it to cut. So I bought a new set of blades. Same thing.So I bought one of the cheaper Norelco Lift And Cut models. Immediately, my shaving time went from seven minutes to 90 seconds. And the shave is much closer - so close my wife noticed it before I could tell her. Sometimes, you can't improve on the old reliable. Anyone want a free used Norelco Arcitec???"
2,"Good Razer, but bad promotion on amazon.com part","Its a good razor, i liked it, but i bought this razor in february thinking that i will get $40 off. never got an email never got any confirmation of any sort about my $40 for future purchase. so if anyone wants to get this razor for the $40 off look else where because you wont get it. other wise its a good razor."
2,not nearly as good as a blade,I was using any number of triple blade razors with no problems except that they are messy having to use shaving cream so I decided to give the Noreclo a try. For the price I thought it would work great since I had heard that high end electrics work well.After using the Norelco arcitec 1050 exclusively for a month I was still having rasor burn and not getting a good shave on my neck. It was also impossible to get a clean line for my sideburns. I read and followed all the directions but was very disappointed in this razor.
3,Braun is Better.,"I own the top-end Braun shaver (""Series 9"" or something like that). I thought maybe that this one might work better for my adam's apple so I bought this one to compare (with the 45-day return policy at the top of my mind). Braun is better, as most of the reviews and surveys said. More expensive (around $200), but I would go for that one if I were you. It has more muscle and the pulsation thing seems to really work - it digs in where this one seems to glide over the top. They both are correct, though, when they say that it takes a few weeks for your beard to adjust to the new shaver so you need to give it time before reaching a verdict."
1,The expensive razor that can't.,I have had this razor since Christmass and what a disapointment. I have had Norelco tripple heads for years and they all did a great job except this one. If you miss a few days shaving forget it. This razor cannot cut longer hairs especially on the neck. It also takes for ever to do a shave. The only redeaming factors are the pivioting head and the long battery life.Considering the price this is a total dud and thus the one star. Save your money and buy one of thier less expensive razors that have the old fashoned blades that actually shave.
1,Don't bother with this. . . it's a waste of money and time,"This shaver was very disappointing. I was excited the first time I used it but after a couple of days the blades seemed to get dull. It would pick and pull on my beard. It would leave random hair on my face and attempts to angle the shaver were not successful. I rarely leave feedback, but this shaver is so bad I felt I had to. My face was raw for two days after I quit using it. I am back to my trusty disposable minus $100 plus."
3,Not bad,The Norelco 1050 shaves a bit closer than my previous Norelco. It is easier to clean. The one negative is the trimmer. It only allows you to square your sideburns. Positioned under the cutters makes it almost impossible to trim other places. With my previous Norelco I would square up my sideburns with the trimmer perpendicular to my head. I would then shorten the rest of the sideburns with the trimmer close to parallel to my head. This latter position is impossible with the 1050.
3,Norelco,The arcitec shaver is the least of three Norelco shavers that I use. The arcitec heads need to be closer toghter. The trimer needs to be longer and wider. It would be great with these adjustments.
2,"Love the razor, hate the trimmer","This my second Norelco, loved both of them. The 1050 trimmer is for the birds. it is hidden under the shaving heads and you can not see it.. Have to guess where it is. Don't buy this shaver if you counting on the trimmer."
2,bad customer service,"Received this arcitec at Christmas, for 30 days I thought what a great razor! For the last 30 days it will not shave at all. Called customer service and they suggested I purchase NEW heads. Do you need new heads every 30 days? Bottom line is customer NO service had no solution and did not offer to replace the heads. Factor in the cost of the heads before you purchase. I did replace the heads and now it works fine. Thanks Philips for all of your assistance."
1,Terrible Razor,"Although it looks sleak, as a razor, this product underperforms. You have to go over areas many times and sometimes, if the facial hair is too long (say, past a 5 o'clock shadow) the razor won't cut it at all. It took me a half an hour to shave with this razor, which is longer than a regular shave. And the final result is a shave that's barely what you'd call ""close"" and a few loose long hairs that the razor couldn't handle. Whoever made it went more for design than practicality. I ended up switching to a regular old Mach 3 I had lying around. Don't make the mistake of buying this razor, you'll be very upset with it in a few weeks."
4,Arcitec 1050,"While it does give a closer shave than my old Norelco, the battery mustbe charged every 4 or 5 days, not the 26 it claims."
4,My cup of tea,"Not one for close shaves, I needed a new shaver and fell into the Consumer Report thing of buying the highest rated shaver: Braun 8985. It was so heavy, it felt like pushing a lawn mower across my face! Then I got the Norelco arcitec 1050. What a beauty. It was love at first shave! On the first shave, I was getting the shave I wanted; did not have to wait the 2-3 weeks for my face to get used to the new shaver, as warned by the manufacturer. I love the way the head glides. Plus,so light and so ergonomically perfect in my hand.Why didn't I give it 5 stars: Assuming that one carries the shaver in the power pod when traveling (its like a travel case), its disappointing that there is no room for the power cord in that pod. Also, while in the pod, you cannot place the head cap. The natural question then is, what kind of architects designed this arcitec?!"
2,not so great,"I got it for my boyfriend after reading through all reviews. Great design, but not too close-cut he said. and you have to open each three top cover and clean them every time."
2,Poor design,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and was happy with them. This design, however, is poorly developed. The three heads have small individual compartments for cut hair and must be cleaned out daily. It's clumsy to open them and the razor is nosier because the heads are above the casing. Also, the charging stand uses up counter space."
1,Useless!,"Philips should be ashamed of themselves. This ""shaver"" is neither use nor ornament! I tried, for a whole year, but I gave up threw the shaver in the trash and went back to a blade. I had an old Philips rotary shaver for years until I dropped and broke it. I bought this because its the top of the line and I had been so please with the old one. What a huge mistake! I wasted $190. Never again will I purchase Philips products. Useless!"
1,worst norelco ever made,I purchased this as a gift for my husband. It is the worst razor he has ever owned. I wound up getting replacement parts for his old Braun razor.no comparison as to the closeness in shave with no burning.
2,DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE THICK STUBLE/COARSE HARI,"I just returned my razor after about 8mo to philips. I never write reviews but felt that this was important for people to know. This razor is not great for someone who shaves rarely,like once a week or who has a thich coarse hair. I never got a great shave and finally complained to customer service who told me that this was probably not the razor for me. They reccomned the traditional style 8260xl that has blades made for more coarse hair. I used this razor last night and it was amazing. I thought others should know."
2,Black,"I've used the Norelco rotating blade shavers for almost 2 decades now. I just bought the Arcitec 1050 at double the money of my previous Norelco that still works, but the battery is holding less of a charge now so I thought more money might be better.I've had the Arcitec for 2 weeks and it is just average and not worth the money. Nothing about it is better than my 5 years ago Norelco, last one I bought. And one thing is definitely worse. I use the clippers on my old Norelco to trim sideburns, mustache, and ears. This new thing must have been designed by a woman. The clipper will protrude very slightly from the body and you cannot use it easily or effectively because the shaving head are in the way. It is really lame.I'm returning it and getting the old style for half the price that I have been very happy with."
2,A step backwards...,"I purchased this shaver when my old Spectra 8894 needed new blades and I am very sorry that I did so. I can't get as good a shave with this new shaver as I can with my old one with worn blades. I am trying to find out if there is a way I can return it because it is a waste of money. Additionally, the trimmer is very small and difficult to use because you have to see what you are doing around the cutting heads. While this is subjective, the unit feels cheap and flimsy compared to my old Norelco."
1,"Looks nice, shaves little.",It simply did not shave well. I took me at least 3 times as long to get a mediocre shave verses my 4 year old shaver. I went for the norelco 8200 series that was more like my old shaver in structure and it works great.
2,Not Impressed,"I decided to finally ""upgrade"" from my 7 year old Norelco with dull blades to this model and have been very disappointed. Shaving with this model takes twice as long as my older model. It especially is difficult to shave longer hairs on the neck, I found myself getting impatient and pulling out a razor to quickly finish the job."
1,Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men's Shaver,"Well, I had high hopes for this razor but after using it for a few months ago, I must say it is a piece of cool looking crap.I had a Norelco razor for around 12 years and loved it just bought new blades a few times over the years. Boy I wish I did not give it to my son.To sum things up This razor does look cool but it sounds cheap the trimmer is crap and it cuts like crap."
4,Awesome battery life,"I've had this shaver for over 2 months now and overall I really like it. At first, I didn't like the idea of having to clean and rinse it after each use, but really it only takes two seconds to do and I think this actually contributes to the long battery life -which is the one of the great things about this shaver (lasts for 2-3 weeks easy). Regarding the shave itself, it compares to every other norelco I've had, it gets the job done. The only reason I can't give this 5 stars, is because of how noisy it is... just a little too much for the morning. Overall good shaver and I wasn't disappointed."
1,The Edsel of razors,"I have used Norelco razors for years, so I looked forward to this top of the line new model. What a disappointment! The design is far out, way too far out! It gives a very poor shave and causes razor burn at the same time. I had thought that these two conditions were mutually exclusive, but Phillips has managed to put them both in this razor. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.I replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.If I were Phillips, I would do what Ford did with the Edsel and withdraw it from the market before it damages their reputation any further."
1,"Doesn't fit, product image is wrong","The item I received doesn't fit my 1993 Toyota Pickup 4x4. If they had sent me the product similar to one in the image it would have fit, but I received a product that doesn't have the eyelets on the end, it has threaded ends.I ended up calling Rancho about this, long story short, the image they use is a lie and you must buy their mounting bracket. It's frustrating because they are selling the product as a bolt in replacement and it's not. Why would I want to cut off my factory mounts and weld on a new one? Maybe if you were installing dual stabilizers, but simply replacing a worn out stabilizer that doesn't make sense.Avoid Rancho on this one."
5,Great Baking on Any Page,"I've owned this cookbook for a number of years, and it is my go-to cookbook when I am looking for some new baked good for my family or to give as gifts. The ""Simplest Apple Pie"" recipe has made unexpected entertaining easier, and my 2-year old loves the gingerbread. Someday I hope to be able to say I've baked everything in this beautiful book!"
3,Home Baking,"While I'm not as accomplished a baker and reviewer as others who have written here, I have done a good amount of baking, which has been pretty successful. The two recipes I've tried from this book, however, have both presented problems. The Russian apple pancake took much, much longer to bake on the stove than the recipe indicated, and the gingerbread was just a failure -- done on the outside, doughy on the inside. My conclusion is that the recipes are not that reliable for this home baker, although I will continue to try others, encouraged by the excellent reviews the book has gotten."
4,another excellent cookbook,"This is the third cookbook from these authors that I have purchased. The first was Beyond the Great Wall. Then Seductions of Rice. Now this one. Beyond the Great Wall was my favourite. This book, while along the same vein - a cookbook combined with world travel, didn't seem to have as much interesting information in it as the others. I also missed seeing some of the more standard classics from certain countries that were missing from this book. How could you be from Canada and miss putting in a recipe for Beaver Tails?! :) That being said, it's still a beautiful cookbook with some wonderful pictures from around the world. If you like this cookbook, I recommend you check out others from these same authors.I made the banana loaf recipe from this book and it got rave reviews from co-workers. On to the next recipe!"
2,"Great book, but mispaginated and fragile binding","I recently purchased Home Baking by Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid for a second time. I love this book. Unfortunately, the binding is especially fragile. I bought the book a number of years ago and the binding almost immediately ripped. I am so disappointed that this is a real problem with the binding of the book and not simply my handling of it, but far worse than a poor binding, I am missing pages and I have repeat pages. Beginning with page 237, everything is fine through page 284. After pages 284 the book repeats pages 237 (and all the content from these pages) through pages 252 before skipping ahead to page 301 and continuing on. What happened?5 stars for content2 stars for binding1 star for mispagination"
2,Poor packaging,The first one came broken and it was a pain to get it exchanged. You couldn't tell untill it was put together that it was broken.
5,Great look and feel,Easy to assemble. No holdups or missing pieces. Sturdy and a great addition to our lounge. Highly recommended. Adjustable shelves in the cabinets for customized storage.
4,Great value for the money,It looks great and comes nearly assembled. I didn't buy it through amazon because I found it cheaper elsewhere but I do recommend this as an entry level bar.
3,Just not what I remember.,"I remember playing this way back when it came out, but just barely. I do remember it was fun though. Then years later, I decided to play it again for nostalgic reasons. It was ok, but just like with a lot of other ps1 games, the graphics are a little too pixelated. Also it's hard to move on to the next levels. It was a great experience to play an old ps1 game, but I wouldn't pick this one to re-visit."
1,busted,the game didn't work. we tried it on an old and new system with no success. so it sucks. more words.
1,Junk,Game did not work with Playstation 2 because it is a Playstation 1 game. It was supposed to though and didn't. Very disappointed.
5,Perfect for my needs,"Worked perfectly. Mesh bag contained all the particles I wanted it to pick-up. The bag is not designed to keep algae and very fine dirt in the bag. Algae is caused by the home owner not maintaining the pool correctly. Do not blame the product. All meshed bags I find on the market are for leaves, mostly tree seedlings and plant blooms.You do not need a lot of hose water pressure to get the unit to work properly. One comment below indicated the hose kept popping off. Well you had to much water pressure for such a small product.Yes you do need to buy a telescoping pool pole. The companies that supply one in their packaging are junk and not sturdy to get the job done.This product touches up the pool and spa so you do not have always plug in your automatic pool vac or pool cleaner to clean small areas."
4,it works!,"So, I did research, and I couldn't find any pool vacuums that got really good reviews (for little above ground pools like ours). So instead of spending a lot of money on one that might not work, I chose to spend little money on one that might not work. But it does! It didn't have directions, so it called for some ingenuity. And I have to unscrew my hose from it's gun, and screw it on the vacuum TIGHT or it will fly off. But I already had a pole, so I didn't have to buy anything else. And for my 12x30 above ground pool, it works great. Especially for the price."
4,Works great for the money!,We ordered this to clean a dunk tank that gets quite a bit of sand in it. It works amazingly well for everything large enough to get caught in the filter bag. For our application it would have been nice to have the peg that the pole connects to be parallel to the wheels rather than perpendicular. No problem though. It works great. The water does have to be deep enough to cover the device and the filter bag.
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!,"First the packaging is the plastic that you must totally destroy to open. Now that its open I attempt to attach it to my NOT INCLUDED STANDARD POLE, which would not fit. So I go to Walmart with the item and their standard poles do not fit either. So at this point I am upset. So I am requesting a refund. Do not waste your money unless you know which pole is needed, which I don't or have. I also have 2 poles which don't fit. GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE!!!!"
3,"Not the strongest vacuum, but not bad.","Doesn't vacuum as well as the Pentair Rainbow Spa Mini Vacuum Model 204 R201146, but it seems to be built slightly sturdier. The Pentair picked up everything off the bottom of the pool, but was fragile at the point where the pole attaches.This Poolmaster doesn't seem to create the same amount of suction, but the wheels help reduce the amount of force applied to the pole attachment and it seems to be made out of tougher plastic so I may sacrifice performance for longevity.Note that vacuums of this type will only capture particles large enough to get trapped in their nets. The net mesh has openings of about 0.5 mm so any smaller particles like soot or fine dirt won't get trapped.Overall, it's a good product for the price and I would recommend it.P.S. My worst complaint about this product is the packaging. The bubble plastic is welded in many spots and is dangerous to open due to the knife I had to use and the sharp plastic itself."
1,Not worth a dime for pond cleanup,This item might work in a filtered swimming pool that never got any leaves in it.No good at all as pond vacuum. The input opening is way too small. Any large leaf or stick gets stuck. Don't waste your money on this as a pond vacuum.
3,Problems but the price is good,"I bought this about a year ago, at Home Depot and just recently had problems. So if you consider I had a year for $20.00 it was a good price. The problems were, the O-ring broke but I did find more O-rings in the Faucet section at Home Depot. Almost at the same time the nylon rope broke. I couldn't believe it being nylon. Nylon is very strong so maybe it was just a freak and it might not happen to anyone else.I am happy with it over all. I use it in my spa and it works well for that. It picks up all the dead bugs and hair but it doesn't pickup the really small stuff. For the spa we change the water every six months anyway so the water doesn't get bad at all using this product during that time period.I'm giving it a 3 star because the price for what you get is good."
4,Perfect for my swim spa...especially for $20,"I'm very happy with this vacuum...particularly for $20. I have a 14 foot long, 4 foot deep swim spa, and small leaves, bugs and debris are often collecting at the bottom. I wanted something inexpensive to clean them up, and took a chance on this product based on the reviews I'd read. It makes quick work of cleaning the bottom of my spa, even when the bottom is heavily covered with small bits of debris. In 5 or 10 minutes at most, it is completely clean with little effort. The device is reasonably well made, and should last indefinitely as long as it isn't stepped on or otherwise abused. The water stream from your hose forces the debris into the bag quickly and easily, and only one or two passes are needed in each area. This is the perfect solution for me. It wouldn't be effective for a pool much bigger than my swim spa, but for small spas, larger swim spas, and smaller pools, this works great for the money."
3,vaccum,The Pond Vaccum wasn't exactly what I expected it to be. It doesn't work well at all with my pond it doesn't suck any of the debris off of the bottom! I personally would not purchase this item again. As a side note the seller of this product was wonderful to work with and I would buy from them again in the future.
3,"Voice of an Angel, perhaps, but...","I guess I'll express the minority opinion on this. She does, indeed, have an absolutely beautiful voice - pure and angelic. My disappointment is that the music is rather dark, sharp and unmelodic. I was really looking for a rendition of the Divine Mercy aired on EWTN twice a day, which is a sweet, passionate song that I can't stop singing. My suggestion - buy Angelina's Rosary CD, but get the Divine Mercy CD from EWTN.com or marian.org (look for the one with Trish Short). Sorry, Angelina, your voice is truly spectacular, I just wish the song were better."
1,Len Martinez,I am not happy with this purchase. I ordered the book over a month ago and still have not received it. I have not had this promblem in the past with Amazon. I inquired once already but have heard nothing. I would like to receive this book ASAP. Thank you.Len Martinez 03/29/10
4,hi,"this album is as good as voice of america, and it has pop, punk, and psychobilly all mixed in. i wish that i could get more info on there new album ""last of the human beings"" ..., or you can get em used here!"
5,Rockabilly new wave,"A pretty darn good album. ""Now I Wanna,"" is a great 3 minute power pop runner. The Quakes aimed at being the next Adam Ant. Their new wave influences show in 'Gothic Girl' which shows how a lack of gothiness causes the guy to fail to get the girl. Hope to see more from the band. Singer/songwriter Paul Roman now resides in Phoenix, Arizona."
1,Pure crap,Enough already with this droning mess. Don't bother with it. It's for snobs and self-defined aristocrats.
5,Good Stuff Good Customer Service,Length:: 1:31 MinsThis is a quick review of Tom's Incense and the product I purchased.
5,I wish you only the best,"I feel very honored to be the first person reviewing this cd...well first off i just wanna say that emotep is a strong and powerful band who knows true music and has a very unique touch. I don't think there should be anyone out there who doesn't like this band. Besides being a great band, the members are what make it strong...being as loyal as possible at all times, even responding to every email. Emotep i only wish you the best in the upcoming years.Cheers"
5,grate rare cd,Amazing cd I love the singer its sad this band broke up I wonder what she is up to now?
5,Unique,"During the time period that Evanescence was yet to blow up, there was the vabd Emotep that formed in Detroit. The music talent here is surprisingly food for some kids that were still in High School. I have always been a huge fan on TOOL, Deftones,Maynard, and female vocalists who lead the band and wrote their own lyrics from the heart.bRAVO to the accomplishment of their passions collectively creating such a raw and emotional album.Too bad they have all went all of their separate ways.I had had privilege of seeing them play several times and so much more."
3,"3.5 stars--Interesting, but not one I'd repurchase","On my skin Bijan with a Twist smells like bergamot/orange, a touch of some spice, amber, vanilla, maybe grapefruit & lavender? This isn't overtly strong and it changes very subtlety playing all the notes throughout the day. The ending act is a powdery bergamot spice. Quite nice.The lasting power is incredible. Two sprays lasted for well over 8 hours on my skin.I wouldn't repurchase after I run out, as I have so many I wear more often. Tho, I do really like this. Worth a try."
5,best christmas music ever !!!,The music on this album is the best for the holiday season! Is is very peppy and fun to listen to. Great for the whole family to enjoy!
1,"Definite ""Don't Buy"" Book","One of the worst textbooks ever produced. Few concrete examples, missing details covered in books like Stewart's Vector Calc (even from older editions) but the most irriatating aspect is the ""cutsie"" comments. For example: page 24 ""with a bit of sneaky algebra.."" page 33 ""we need to cheat here...."" page 45 ""finding 3 points in a plane is not difficult"" page page 103 ""3x-5y +2z =12 as should be obvious"" and the worst of all page 145 ""we will therefore continue to commit such abuses and urge you to do likewise, provided you understand you sins ( and repent appropriately)""For an MIT graduate, this is an extremely poor performance and big name schools such as the Univ. of Maryland should think twice before adopting such a poor educational tool."
2,Nothing sets this book apart from other calc books.,This book is a good example of how people like to write calculus books for the sake of writing calculus books.Colley's book is littered with annoying examples that break the continuity of the theory. This makes the entire book a drag to read.The homework exercises are all pretty routine as far as Calc 3 class is concerned.I think the old Courant books should still be used in place of all these rehash texts.
2,Little confusing,"I have been using this book for a course in Vector Cal. thissemester. I have to say that the large price tag was a big turnoff to start, but I can get past that if the book is worth it. So far I am not impressed with this book. The examples are poor and the methods taught are a little confusing at best. Some havefound this book to be great in the way that the material is explained but I had some serious issues with the way the material was presented. I ended up buying several other books on vector calculus and using internet sites from other universities to supplement this book. As a stand alone this book has some serious issues. Try to avoid it if you can."
4,Very Good,"The Santanera, a very classy & elegant Afro-Cub band from Tamaulipas, created some great music over the years and earned popular acclaim. Nonetheless, they were relegated to low budget productions that resulted in less-than world class recording quality. In this Live CD, they were finally provided with some decent recording equipment - mostly as a result of the inherent technological improvements over the last 4 decades and not as a result of any significant production investment - they utilized it well and put out a very good production. I did not concede them a 5 star rating because their instrumental & technical dexterity was not at an elite level (understandable at the tail-end of 40 year history)."
1,piece of pipe,"I ordered a wand extension and got a piece of threaded pipe. When I contacted the seller they stated that is what I bought but if I wanted to use it as a wand extension I could buy the the other parts. The price of the other parts equaled the price of the pipe, doubling the price of what I wanted. I bought the extension from someone else and then had to contact Amazom to get my refund for the returned pipe. Not a great experiance or value and will not buy from this vendor again."
1,Fraud! Beware of the seller!,"The label says ""36"" Wand Extension"" the picture shows a 36"" wand extension but what you get is a simple lance, which require additional adapters."
5,It was the best I have ever heard it!,"Gypsy! A lot of ppl have heard about it! I love it! I was in it just 31/2 montyhes ago! It was the greatest! That show has some of the greatest music of all time: ""Everythings Comin up Roses"", ""Togethor Wherever we go"", and of course ""Little Lamb"" It is the best sounding CD of it I have heard! It is wonderful! Trust me I am a normal person just like you! It is fantastick!"
2,"Lifeless, Boggy","Not one of my favorite recordings of this show. The orchestra players were either stoned or followed different conductors when they recorded the overture. The score must be deceptively difficult to sing, as Angela Lansbury screams herself hoarse at astonishingly/agonizingly slow tempos. To my ear, she was much better suited for the excellent cast recording of ""Sweeney Todd""- still one of my favorites...'nuff said."
2,Fair.,Angela Lansbury is really talented but I don't think she can belt out these songs as good as Ethel Merman can.
4,Simple but helpful advice,"Living with anxiety or with someone who has anxiety can be overwhelming. This book give practical, simple advice that offers guidance and comfort."
4,As a fan and a collector of the work of Johnny Depp....,"As a fan and a collector of the work of Johnny Depp I had to have this interview.We see J. Depp in the peron of him self with his own laughter.They talk about some of the most famous movie and why he chose some of the strangest characters he has played. And his own way to play them, what he think of...and so onJ.Depp talk about his way in to acting and His vision of himself as an actor.I loved it, wish it was longer but it is only one interview.If you are a fan or just want to know more about a actor that don't give so many interview about him self. This is your chance.The interview contains some surprises (the best way). We meet J. Depp in the best view from his cigarillos to his old boots.Review from Norway."
5,Pure Genius!,"I had recorded this a few years ago when it first aired, but my copy has become damaged. I was afraid I would not get to own this interview again, and I found it here! It's a great piece to add to your Johnny Depp collection, as it lets you see him upclose and personal - and answering great questions with clever answers. Love Live Johnny!"
1,Underqualified author,"The author obviously was trying to use ""fact""(which was often fiction) to spread a hate agenda."
5,A Beautiful Keepsake,"This is one of the most beautiful miniture books I've ever read. The photography is stunning, even on small scale, and I've found myself paging through it again and again. I originally bought the book as a gift for a friend who was engaged but ended up keeping it for myself! The strong point of this book is definately the pictures. The text is very limited, and I didn't get any new ideas for a wedding that I hadn't heard before, but obviously this miniature edition is very much scaled down from the bohemoth original volume. A must-have for anyone who loves weddings!"
1,Don't Buy!,"First of all, this watch is incredibly difficult to set up. The operation guide is hard to understand. Secondly, it is also very difficult to press the heart rate buttons on the right hand side while you're working out. The manual says to hold the buttons down for 5-7 seconds, however, I find myself having to hold the buttons down for 10-15 seconds sometimes. Even worse, after 15 seconds of holding the buttons down, it won't even give me a heart rate reading! So, I would suggest not wasting your money on this worthless product."
1,Not Pleased,"This watch is too hard to get my heart rate while working out. It is not convenient nor user friendly. After having it less than two months, the watch ""locked up"" while trying to get my heart rate. I had to remove the battery to reset it. My opinion is, don't waste your money as I have!"
2,Just OK,This monitor is not good for those who want a challenging workout. The finger buttons are difficult to press when standing still and even harder when you are running or on any kind of machine. It might work for walkers or those who want a cute watch.
5,AWESOME,"I have had this cd for a long long time. It just recently broke and I can't seem to find it anywhere, but here! It is one of the best positive rap cd's I have ever heard. It is an awesome cd!"
1,Waht a waste of money!,"This product seemed like such a great idea but it fell far short of my expectations. It hung up all the time, there was still litter all over the floor around it - especailly where the trays go and the trays are hard to get out without getting cat waste on ones hands. It's still a great concept but needs to be completely re-engineered. Finally, after a couple months the motor died and now I'm back to scooping my own litter. I do not reccomend this product at all."
3,works well enough- but,"Plain old charcoal briquettes work even better. We have 3 cats, and our littermaid gets a workout. The filters did cut the odor, but I've found that a couple of charcoal briquettes works really well, and they're much cheaper."
3,"Better, but",The filters do seem to do the job. The odor from the cat box is less than without the filter. But the adhesive that holds it in place could be better. Frequently the filter ends up in the receptacle because the adhesive has failed.
2,Adhesive doesn't stick very well - just use a bit of baking soda,"Not worth the money when a bit of baking soda or cat box deodorizer in the catch box works just as well. The barbeque briquette is a clever and cheap idea BUT If you decide to use a charcoal briquette, DON'T USE SELF LIGHTING TYPES - THEY CONTAIN A FLAMMABLE ADDITIVE."
1,Worthless-no impact on odor whatsoever,These filters have no discernable impact on odor. It is far better (and cost effective) to simply apply baking soda or some other odor absorbent to the litter box and the litter tray.
2,No magic here,I've only used these when they were included with the purchase of a new LitterMaid litter box. They seem to have only a slight impact on odor levels.
3,"Great at reducing odor, bad at sticking","These things are great for masking the odor of litter boxes, but they do have trouble staying on the litter compartment. I find that using super glue works well though and requires just one extra step."
3,LitterMaid filters,I have found that they don't adhere to the top of the receptacles very well. But other then that I need them so I have to live with it.
1,DOESN'T STICK,The adhesive pad on the back pretty much suck! They fall off soon after you attach it to the inside lid of the litter catcher.
1,Don't need them,You don't need these. Just sprinkle some Baking Soda in you box and receptacle and it will do. The self cleaning box is a joke don't buy it.
2,Didn't help much for 2 cats,"I believe it works, but I can't tell if it is really working. I have two cats using the same litterbox. I clean it twice a week. When it stinks, it stinks no matter what."
1,Not worth a dime!!,"They immediately fall into the receptacle and do not control the odor at all, even if left in the receptacle."
3,Essential for your LitterMaid,"These carbon filters keep down odors from your LitterMaid cat litter system. There is a peel and stick piece on them that is supposed to adhere them to the lid of the used litter receptacle. Unfortunately, this piece fails almost 100% of the time and the very pricey carbon filter ends up down in the poo. Gotta have them but wish they stayed adhered better."
3,Do They Work? Do They...,"So I have 1 lean black cat, who only eats cat food (people food can mess cat's stomach up) and purchased the Littermaid box for him - his poop smells lol so I decided to get these... Not sure they work though because I can still smell it. Maybe it does or maybe a waste of money. I won't be buying more."
5,need for speed v rally,this is a good game but the graphics are kind of bad what do you expect from a 10 year old system
2,Doesn't stand up to the first,Shadow of the Mountains is the only book in the Cheney Duvall series that I recommend you skip. It seems that a good deal of effort was put into building up Cheney and Shiloh's relationship in the first book and then in this book it's all torn down. The characters simply weren't as memorable in the first book of the series and it lacks a sense of adventure that the first had. I suggest that you skip this book in the series and move onto the next. You'll be missing nothing.
2,Not up to par with the rest,"I've read (and in fact own) all the other Cheney and Cheney/Shiloh books, but can't bring myself to buy this one or read it more than once every couple years, if that. It didn't have the same feel for me as the rest of them did, and I really didn't like the character of Maeva Wilding. Yes, I'll admit, it was partially because she was a threat to the whole Cheney/Shiloh ship, but she was just a weird character that made the whole book sort of a one-off disappointment to me. I love every other book, but this one is just ... different. You lose nothing by skipping it and going to book 3, A City Not Forsaken."
1,I miss Lindsey,"I too am a longtime fan of Johanna Lindsey and love the Mallory clan. I cannot say however that this book is worthy of the moniker ""A Lindsey."" The formula is outdated and not sophisticated enough. I think she has forgotten that her fans have aged as she has and the simple naive lasses of 20 years ago don't read as fun or fresh today. The tongue and cheek humor and swashbuckling adventure of Jason's and Anthony's stories have disappeared and the interconnectedness of all these characters almost feels incestuous. Ms Lindsey needs fresh characters and plots even in the historical genre."
2,Not so great,"I have read a great many of Johanna Lindsey's books and enjoyed many, but I found this one to be pretty stupid, as well as almost offensive. Not only does the 'hero' believe the heroine to be a fairly despicable character (though he wants to bed her), he also semi-rapes her (while she is asleep). Even when he discovers she is (was) a virgin, he doesn't change his opinion. She seems to be an idiot-basically forgiving his forcing sex on her without much of a problem. NOT a keeper."
5,Captive if My Desires (A Malory Novel),"As usual, Johanna Lindsey has written a wonderully engaging novel about the Malorys. I picked it up and was enjoying it so much I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day. I was glad she finally chose another Anderson brother to write a story about - Drew in this case. I love these characters and can't wait for the next installment in the Malory series. It is beautifully written and extremely good. If you enjoyed the past Malory books, you'll love this one as well. Happy reading!"
4,Another great Malory story,Another great story by Lindsey. Reading this was like catching up with old friends. Truly enjoyable! Worth reading. There were a couple of fun twists too.
1,Ghost Writer?,"ANOTHER Lindsey book I couldn't finish.I have come to believe the publishing company is using a ""ghost writer"" to pen the ""Johanna Lindsey"" novels. If you compare her early books...especially the Mallory novels...to her later novels, the quality, maturity and depth of the writing that made her early books so good is obviously not in the later books. I would even go so far as to say that her latest books haven't even been written by the same ""ghost""...some are so shallow and silly I am amazed the publisher let them be attached to the Lindsey name.Johanna Lindsey used to be on my ""buy hardcover"" list. Now I won't even buy paperback...either I get a book from the library or used...preferably from the library so I'm not paying for a book I won't finish."
1,Another rapist hero,"If I could give this zero stars I would. This book has another obnoxious, abusive, selfish, self-centered rapist as a hero. He even offers to make amends for raping her by not turning her over to the police.After raping her, he chains her to a wall after making sure he had taken away the ability to rescue her father.I couldn't finish this book. I knew the heroine would forgive the rapist and I just wanted him dead."
3,Lindsey has been abducted!,"There's quite a few reviews on this novel that give overviews of the plotline so I won't bore anyone with repition of that. I can say that I believe someone has stolen the Lindsey. That's what I figure as the last few novels seem like they have been written by someone else. Lindsey was always on my automatic buy list - she's written some truly memorable novels (The 'older' Mallory novels are awesome). I keep feeling compelled to buy her novels, out of loyalty I suppose, but then I'm just let down in the end. This one is passable I suppose but it's just not the same Lindsey so whoever has taken her, please send her back."
2,"I've seen far better from Lindsey, but also far worse","I love Johanna Lindsey. I will read anything that she writes, even if I do occasionally get burned. That being said, this book burned me badly. The hero and heroine have little, if any chemistry. The story lacks depth. The action/turning point is virtually nonexistent. And even the bad guy doesn't do anything to make him so terrible. Really, it's a waste of your time.I firmly believe that since Lindsey started writing in the late 70's and has continued to be a prolific author for nearly 30 years, that she's just churning out nonsense now. She's told all the good stories there were to tell, and her best work is right around the midpoint in the late 80's and early nineties. Don't believe me? Check out Prisoner of My Desire and Love Me Forever. Then check out her newer works like Heart of A Warrior and Captive of My Desire. The truth will be as plain as day."
1,Captive of My Desires,"Dear Readers:Ms. Lindsey and her editor were sleeping through this installment of the Malory family saga. Not only does Ms. Lindsey not deliver with her usual witty dialogue and description, she leaves the reader wondering where the plot went. Captive of My Desires has few redeeming qualities. You're not sure if Drew and Gabby are truly even interested in one another or being manipulated to fit into the author's plot when it's there. The dialogue is stilted and forced and the plot trite and full of holes. The ending is contrived and unrealistic. Sadly, the only interesting part of the book was catching up with the Malory family. I'm sorry to say this book is a shipwreck and not worth the $25.00 I had to pay for it."
1,Very Disappointed,"Sadly, this is the most disappointing of the Malory novels. I found the characters undeveloped and rather boring. Johanna Lindsey's previous Malory novels were much more exciting and the characters were very likeable despite their flaws. In this latest installment, Drew was mostly morose, brooding and not very likeable at all and I found Gabrielle shallow and silly while the dialogue between her and Drew not very exciting. The best parts of the story included the characters from her previous novels like James, Tony and Georgiana."
4,Captive of My Desires,I love Johanna Lindsey so I really enjoy her books. I can't wait to read the new one out.
5,"Truely a ""Lindsey""","If you are a fan of ""Lindsey's"" you don't want to miss this one. A great read for the romance as well as the adventure lover in you."
3,Let Down,"I love Johanna Lindsey and her previous books were so good. But sadly this book lacked the funny interludes, the backstory on the characters and any real chemistry between Gabrielle and Drew. In the beginning when we are first introduced to Gabrielle, it feels really rushed and everything is smashed together. One minute she's captured by pirates, next minute there's her long-lost father. No lead up at all. I do rate it a 3 simply because it continues in the Mallory/Anderson series which is so good. If you feel a little let down like I did reread the first novels from this series and you'll realize why we love Johanna Lindsey so much."
1,Caution.....Disgusting,"Caution - Rapist contained within. First the ""hero"" tries to take advantage of the heroine/victim after getting her drunk. Then later in the story he rapes her in her sleep.The disgusting part is the writer excuses his behavior by having the victim take the blame for the rape. Then he chains her to a wall. I was nauseous and had to stop listening.I will never buy another Johanna Lindsey book again."
1,What has happened to Lindsey's writing?,"I have been a fan of Johanna Lindsey ever since I was in HS. I particular love the Malory series. I kept flipping through the pages trying to find the ""good part"". Unfortuantely, I couldn't find it.If you buy this book please please buy it used, because it is not worth the money."
4,Entertaining,"This book held my attention the whole way through. When Gabby is kidnapped by pirates and saved by her father, he decides she needs a proper husbund. He sends her to live with an aquaintance in London, where she is a huge social sucess... until her escort reveals a dark family secret, ruining her chances in the social circles. Gabby is out for revenge.... but what will it cost her?"
2,Readable but not recommended. I didn't admire or enjoy the heroine.,"She had no qualities to make the story interesting. I found no interesting reasons for Drew to want to give up his bachelor life for her. There was also nothing special about Drew, causing me to see why she would want to marry him. This was about two people who were good looking, who saw each other and then immediately loved each other. There was no build up of interest or the growing of a relationship.CAUTION SPOILER: I hated that she stole his ship from him. I don't care what her reasons were.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: early 1800s London and the high seas. Copyright: 2006. Genre: regency romance.For a list of my reviews of other Johanna Lindsey books, see my 5 star review of ""Gentle Rogue"" posted 6/14/08."
3,Fantasy maker.....,"I enjoyed the book--it gave me idea--unfortunately JL didn't go as erotic on this one as I wanted her two. The heroine had the hero tied up and at her mercy---she needed to do more than touch him while giving him a bath! Well, I at least wanted her to do more.....The story was well thought out and interesting the final plot was rather predictable, but I expected that it would be. I had read enough Mallory novels in bygone years to be able to recognize the supporting characters."
4,Returning to her previous writing,"For a time, JL's writing took a slide from her former humour, wit, etc. It was almost as if someone else was writing in her stead. COMD sees a return of her previous writing. Not quite on par with what she used to write but certainly better than some of the books over the last few years. I look forward to reading her latest."
3,"Fun book, not too deep","I liked this book. It did remind me of her previous work. However, I hadn't read anything by Johanna Lindsey in a long time so I wasn't disappointed that it was similar to other books. This is a definitely a book that you check out from the library or buy used (like I did)."
1,Terrible,"I generally enjoy Lindsey's novels, but this one was terrible! I can't believe it was even written by her - she must have churned it out too quickly. The dialogue was boring and at times absurd, and the storyline disjointed. The basic plot was fine, and could have been quite exciting. And there were some humorous additions, such as the smart-talking parrot. But so many elements seemed to be just tossed in without any conclusion or flow: Avery's appearance as a villain, Wilbur's defection, among others. I can't believe I made it through the entire book!"
1,Disappointing - Don't bother,"Wow - but not in a good way. Possibly the worst romance novel I've ever read, and that is saying something. Stick to Lindsay's earlier Malory novels. Most of them are delightful and worth revisiting. ""Captive"" skims over parts of the story that could be exciting and dwells on the boring, predictable and outright unbelievable."
2,Oh so disappointing . . .,"I was very disappointed in this latest installment of the Malory family. I loved the previous Malory novels, but this one really lacked in development and likeability. In this book, Drew seems more of a cad than romantic hero. He doesn't seem much like the fun loving Drew who had been introduced in the previous novels. The hereoine, ""Gabby"", isn't likeable either. The characters just don't seem very believable, and the relationship seems strained to me.The best part of the book is that you will revisit your favorite characters from before, like Georgina and James Malory."
2,Waste of time,"The majority of this book felt like it was rehashing stories from her previous books. There was barely any room left for an original story... and that part was confusing and poorly written.If the author can't think of anything new to write about the Mallory family, she should pick a new subject. I miss the stories she used to provide."
3,Not your typical Malory Family Novel,"As I am a huge fan of the Malory Family novels, I found this one to be okay but I was hoping for more of the Malory family as with Warren & Amy. The previous 7 novels were excellent and stayed true to the Malory family. Since this is a such a big family there are more than enough characters to cover. Although I did enjoy Drew Anderson's wit and charm, I was hoping for more Tony, Jeremy, Connie, Regina & of course James & George. I would recommend it, but I hope the next book has more of the family in it. We still can have stories of Connie, Edward Malory's 2 sons, and we can always skip ahead to Tony & James's children as teens. I would love to read about James exploits when his daughter grows up. That should be very very interesting."
1,Short but negative,This book did nothing for me and I recommend that you not waste your money on it. It is written for the simple-minded reader with not much excitement at all. Too bad that Ms. Lindsey has fallen so low in her writing.
2,Not a typical Malory Novel,"Like everyone else I could not wait for this book to come out. I was so excited because I loved the Malory family. This was disappointing because of the focus of the book. I would have preferred it had been longer if that meant it would go into more detail about the family. In Gentle Rogue you first meet Red, the female Pirate. She is reintroduced here but with no exchange with James or George. Also I did not care for the young pirates' interest in George. I was truly disappointed, and hope her next Malory Novel is a lot better. There was also little talk about the rest of the family and of Drew's brothers."
1,Malory family novels used to captivate,"Unfortunately this addition to the family story does not captivate. There was little character development, the story line seemed to be hurried along and was quickly and easily resolved. The romance was flat, I felt like it was a forgotten line in the book and Ms. Lindsey had to throw the resolution in at the last minute. I bought this book, after reading it I decided it was not worth the full price of a hard back and returned it for a refund. I'll be checking Ms. Lindsey's books out from the library in the future."
2,definitely not her best,"This definitely lacks the brilliance of earlier Lindsey work. Her older characters were flawed but loveable, these are simply flawed and frankly lacking in sufficient dimension to be loveable. The sets ups are trite and unbelieveable, particulary the totally unnecessary ""lady pirate"" plot line. It's not the worst novel I've ever read but I can't recall a single scene worth reading again."
4,Probably the best offshoot of Malory novels,"For me, here's the best ranking of Malory novels:1) Gentle Rogue (BY FAR the best)2) Tender Rebel3) TIE: Say You Love Me and Love Only Once4) Captive of My Desires5) The Magic of You6) That Perfect Someone7) The Present8) Boyd's one, I forget the name it was that dreadful( I have yet to read A Loving Scoundrel)I only didn't like Boyd's one, No Choice But Seduction for being rather lousy. I'd say this is the best novel of the male Andersons. It wasn't fabulous, but it wasn't bad either. The sex scenes are great, and I'd say the romance is believable. Rent it from the library if you don't love the Malorys like I do."
2,"""Choppy, Choppy, Choppy""","I have read past Malory books and the writing in this book was just too choppy. I thought the story was a bit too immature for my liking. THe hero(Gabrielle) was pretty good. I also liked the Hero (Drew). However, the story and plot was a bit boring and corny."
2,The Doll That Came Apart,"I gave this to my five year old granddaughter who is our Tinkerbell fan. Before three days passed the wings were gone and it was just like any other dolls that size. I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. After all, what is Tink without her wings in the mind of a five year old?"
2,Not as good as the movie,"Hammer films did a film version of this novel. I believe it was shot under the title INCENSE FOR THE DAMNED but that is not the title of the copy I saw. The book is written in a sort of ""British Drawing Room"" style. Fans of old school horror will enjoy the book but those into more modern horror fiction will no doubt be bored. It takes forever to get anywhere but once it does it has a few moments of frisson. I recommend the movie which is absolutely a relic of the 60s ""Swinging London"" scene and features horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee."
1,I keep trying to like this one...,"Beware. I bought this disk purely on the basis of the reviews I read. What a disappointment. While Mike Barris is certainly a skilled guitar player, that is not enough. He did sound like he was enjoying himself, although that is not necessarily a good reason to go public. The percussionist seems to have a gift, and I kept hoping to hear more from him and less of the singing. Or none of the singing at all. Most of the songs sounded about the same to me and gave me the feeling I was fending off a headache--every time I tried to listen to it. Ah well, different strokes...."
2,Terrific musicianship! Arrangements are a different matter,"I like James Galway because he's a terrific musician with superb technique that can play almost any genre [pop & classical] and different historical styles [Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Contemporary, etc.].Although Galway played very well as usual in this recording [especially in the Carmen Fantasy], there were just a few tracks that really sparkles: Marais's Le Basque, Brain Borus' March, Belfast Hornpipe, and Spanish Love Song. The arranger(s) had probably hoped that by replacing the original instruments [voice, violin, piano, etc.] of the original music with the flute, it would give all the works a new skin and dimension/insight. Unfortunately, it didn't work quite as planned. The majority of the orchestral arrangements sounded either trite, labored, layered, or limp: Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, Kreisler's Liebesfreud, Denver's Annie's Song, Carmen Fantasy, Mozart's Piano Sonata in C..."
5,Yazbek = Accessible pop + too-intelligent lyrics,"Yazbek is best known (arguably) for co-writing the theme song to the kids' game show ""Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego."" But under the innocent visage is a sarcastic, wry lyricist with a penchant for music with hooks. Tock is a great album, hands down. Think Elvis Costello meets Joe Walsh without the rock-star ego."
3,Dated graphics,"I used to have Gran Tourismo for the Playstation 1 and I'm pretty sure that the graphics were way better than Road Rash Jailbreak. Playing this game is constant eye-strain, because the graphics are so blocky and smudgy. The crash intelligence is seemingly random. Sometimes when you intentionally get close but not too close to an object, you crash anyway. Other times you're sure that you've hit it, but the game seems to arbitrarily decide that you haven't and does wierd things to let you off without a crash. I hit a tree at triple digits and seemed to bounce backward 100 yards and landed perfectly intact, right-side-up in front of another tree, then as soon as I hit the throttle and hit the tree, I go flying off my bike and skid down the road 50 miles. It just don't make no sense half the time."
5,An ok game,The game is ok. When I first played it it seemed boring untill I read the intructions and learned the moves and the basics of the game. Then the game is cool. One player mode is anyway. I havn't played with a friend yet on it but one player mode is ok. It brings back memories of the old Sega Genises game that I used to play as a little kid.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I tried to play this game for a week before I through it in the garbage. The first Road Rash I have for the Sony PlayStation is much better.
5,video game,i chose this rating cause this video game is very fun to play for the playstation. the product came on time.
4,the reality of living on a spiritual path,"....this book is the last one from a series of five, published as ""Law of One"" (also as ""The Ra Material""). Included is the personal material removed from the previous four volumes. The subject of the Law of One books is the spiritual evolution of humankind. This is a channeled material in a question-and-answer format that requires some attention to grasp. The entity providing the answers (""RA"")claims to be an extra-terrestrial. I have found the books inspiring, although this applies more to the first four volumes which are more general. This last volume (Personal Material) builds on the info given in the previous four books."
2,Pesado y mala edicion,"Pues ya lo vi y no me gusto, No esta bien editado, pareciera un trabajo hecho por alguien que apenas sabe que onda, el track 3 y 6 van desfazados el audio del video.Si me aguite por comprar original, consigo un producto de baja calidad.De lo malo, lo bueno;Me gusto el servicio de Amazon par poder lcoalizar este DVD y la entrega fue mas rapida de lo esperada"
4,Love with the Proper Husband,"Good romance. I'm Victoria Alexander's fan. Read most of the book in this series, always enjoy her writing, charters, and stories."
2,Don't bother,"This is the third Victoria Alexander book I've tried to read, and by now I should have realized that buying one of her books would be a waste of my time and money. I keep trying to be optimistic about her, but this book finally sealed the deal. No more Victoria Alexander for me. All her books are so formulaic and cookie cutter. It seems I've read all these words before. I could barely make it to the midway point. Her male protagonist, Marcus Holcroft, is a dull bore. There's nothing exciting even lurking in his past. Gwendolyn Townsend, our female protagonist, is slightly more interesting. But, the plot just didn't keep my attention. And, most importantly, Ms. Alexander needs to take a college course on how to write dialogue. Very ho-hum. The main characters might have kept my interest more if they had some snappy dialogue. All in all, very disappointing. Don't bother spending the money."
2,YAWN!,"This is the first Victoria Alexander book I've ever made it through - and believe me it was a struggle. The plot was okay and the characters were okay but that's about the best I can say about it - just okay. I thought the dialog was too modern and the explanations given by certain characters to explain their behavior were [weak]. It seemed to me that these [weak] excuses were inserted to give the story a more suspenseful edge to it, but overall I thought they were silly. I couldn't believe how oh so insightful the hero, Marcus Holcroft was. Ladies! We all know how dense men can be but Marcus H. seemed to always know what was going on in Gwendolyn's mind.If you are a fan, I know I won't change your mind, but if you are new to Victoria Alexander books, you may want to borrow her books from a library instead of buying them."
4,For an arranged marriage this one had lots of love!,"Through the manipulation of match making mamma's - in this case Marcus's own momma Helena - it appeared that Marcus had to marry Gwen in order to maintain his fortune. Gwen, had had a difficult life and no reason to trust anyone especially men. At first she was reluctant to wed Marcus even though he seemed quite perfect -looks, background, kind, intelligent what more could she want. She all of a sudden found herself having to care for her 3 nieces so she instantly agreed to the wedding,keeping the secret of her nieces from Marcus. I am always amazed how quickly some of these arranged romances actually become love matches. But this one did and the feelings were very real and the story quite interesting. Marcus wanted a complete marriage with trust and forever, it took a little longer for Gwen to find this with Marcus but when she did it was a complete and happy union for the two of them - and Marcus's mother Helena was quite proud of herself."
4,Air Hog,"I really liked the performance of this gun but it is definately an air hog. I used it this past weekend to texture the walls and ceiling in my master bedroom. I have a 60 gallon air compressor with 6hp motor. The one thing I don't like about this gun, and probably would have went with a different product if I had known was when you turn on the air valve, air continuously blows and when you pull the trigger mud is released into the air stream. So you can't just turn it on and flow air as needed by trigger pull. I can't imagine someone using this hopper gun with a small compressor as it gave mine a decent work out. At first I thought there was a problem with the gun, so I took it apart to make sure something wasn't missing or not functioning. But it looked like it was set up properly. Product performs well, be ready for it really use up some air."
5,Good value,I purchased this product instead of renting one because it was cheaper. I was suprised to find out how light weight this one is and how easy it is to use.I recommend this product to anyone.
3,It is still new and works as advertised,"I bought it to produce steam for steam bending wood. We shall have to see how well it holds up in service. For right now, it is doing everything it is designed to do."
5,Helps to Save Your Drywall,"This is a good, reliable product that certainly cuts down on the effort of removing wallpaper that is determined to stay on the wall. Be careful not to overfill the bucket as it will steam over and easily burn you. Even if I never used the machine again, it would be worth the money I spent just to get the help on the one large room I was having problems with."
3,Basic functional unit,The unit does the job but has no beneficial features. It needs a longer and better hose and it needs a Trigger to control the steam flow as well as a diffuser plate to improve the function and safety of the unit.
3,Get the Home Depot version,"I bought this at Home Depot to get the small area accessory and I'm glad I did- I gave it more use than the large one included here. The lack of an on/off switch is a hassle but not a killer. Overall I realize that the success you get with a steamer is dependent on the whims of evil trolls (AKA: previous homeowners). Multiple layers, weird thick paste concoctions,even hot melt glue. I found the small attachment most effective because it put the same amount of steam into a much smaller area. Even so, I ended up dry-stripping a lot because I couldn't get a last heavy layer off even with heavy-duty perforating and scoring. Now for the plaster repairs!"
2,Didn't work very well for me.,"I ordered this for a big weekend project tackling my daughter's ugly papered kitchen walls. Opened it, It looked fine, threw out all of the packaging and took it over to her house. Unfortunately the base was cracked and water leaked out everywhere. We tried to patch it up to get it to hold water, (we were determined to get this paper down) but my daughter, holding wet towels against the wall, and them scraping, accomplished far more than I did with this steamer. My caution about this product is that you inspect it carefully when it arrives, BEFORE you need to use it and throw away the packaging."
5,Product is a real Timesaver,Could not be happier with the product. Did a great job in removing old wallpaper. Just be sure not to drip any of the hot water on your hands while working with the steamer. We used it to remove wallpaper in four rooms and could not have done it any quicker if not for this steamer.
5,A real time saver.,"Arrived today. Within an hour I was taking off wallpaper.Steam is wetter than I expected. You might want to keep a bucket or tray handy for the excess.To avoid a spark when unplugging, I used a power strip to turn it off.It's simple. Parts fit together. Current seemed to be within specs. An old house, so I ran the lawn mower cord to the work area. Got warm, but not hot.It's a great time saver. I'm painting the house and it's taking forever. Getting the wallpaper off, is a real pain. And a time killer. Score, spray, wait. Repeat. Fifteen minutes per spray, and I only have a couple hours or less each day to spend on it.Summary, if you have wallpaper to take off, limited time and skills, buy it. If you have lots of small areas, Wagner has an attachment: P/N: 0282213-STEAMPLATE/LABEL ASSY. SMALL. Haven't found dimensions. I made do without.I bought it just to remove wallpaper. Not interested in a steam cleaner."
4,you get what you pay for...,I ordered this and used it to remove wallpaper that has been in my grandmothers house for over thirty years and it did the job. The only bad thing about the steamer is that you do have to watch how much you steam the drywall. The problem with it is if you stem too little it doesn't budge and too much you damage the wall so i would just be careful with the steam. You will probubly end up having to patch the drywall in a few places if you have an older home so plan on that expense.
5,Excellent product,"I have used the Wagner Power Steamer for 2 different types of wallpaper removal jobs, and I was amazed at how fast it worked each time. I would say it cuts your time in less than half, plus you don't have to smell the nasty fumes from the chemical spray, or spend money on rental of those big heavy machines."
5,Amazing,"We bought one unit for a new home where the previous owner loved wallpaper. Not only wallpaper but decals and borders on top wallpaper. This steamer helped remove the wallpaper so quickly that we went to a local home improvement store to purchase another, and in that unit there was a small attachment specifically for borders or tight places."
5,Surprisingly effective,"Having spent more than my fair share on bulky, ridiculously expensive commercial rental machines, I wasn't expecting much from the Wagner unit. I am delighted to state I was completely wrong on its capabilities.With the exception of lacking an attachment for tight places, this machine works as well (or perhaps better) than pricier units - and the cost just can't be beat. Including the usual shipping + handling, I picked this up for less than the price of a 3-day rental. The hose was adequate for reaching the top portions of a vaulted wall, the capacity of the water reservoir allowed me to work for several hours straight, and it all packed up with little dis-assemble, cleaning necessary.A must-have for anyone facing a 70s style home with what seems like miles of wallpaper."
5,Review of Wagner 1G Wallpaper Steamer #705,"I had never removed wallpaper before and I found the Wagner 1G Wallpaper Steamer very easy to use and my wallpaper was put up in the 80's. At first I was concern about dripping water from the steamer plate but was happy to find that there was very little dripping. I found that although it worked well with the top layer of the wallpaper still on, it was very easy with the top layer peeled off, which luckly for me was also easy to do. The 1G tank of water lasted a good hour and clean up of the equipment was easy; just empty the water out of the tank and wipe of the steamer plate with a paper towell. The only draw back that I found was that the steamer plate was sometimes too large for in between windows or other narrow areas. Although, you can order a narrower attachment, I used a chemical wallpaper remover for these areas. I recommend the Wagner 1G Wallpaper Steamer"
5,Stop reading and buy it,"Stop reading and buy it. This product works perfectly and is worth every penny.It's better than chemicals. It's better than scrapers. It's better than pulling your hair out.If you are removing a large amount of wallpaper, it's still going to be a chore, but this product will absolutely make it as painless as possible."
4,Great Product,"Do-it-yourself projects always appear easier than they actually end up being. I first started wall paper removal in kitchen & laundry room with the waste of money & time chemicals. This great little power steamer was the only thing that worked. Be careful about the steam - boy, does it burn! Also, don't just drop the hose on your floor with the steam coming out or else it'll warp your linoleum. I used it without the plate and thought it worked better as I was able to focus the steam on a particular area and pull off wallpaper at the same time."
5,Great product,Solid feel. Firm grip. Easy sliding. Very well made product. I have already used it for a couple of projects successfully! Highly recommend.
4,"Strong bar, but only if you need the rigidity","Bessy clamps are very good, and this clamp's relatively short jaw reach is not quite as deep as the Harbor Freight version of the clamp, although the bar is far heavier and considerably more rigid than the HF version. This is not really that usable if you are trying to keep everything absolutely square, that requires a far heavier and more expensive parallel clamp, which Jet makes slightly better than Bessy. The jet has a quick release that is a pleasure to use. Seems to me it is impossible to have too many clamps, especially the short ones HF sells for about $ 3 to $4.Jet 70440-2 40"" Parallel Clamp, set of 2"
1,Bad Product,You pay what you don't want.Not strong enough at all. It already bends if you want to tighten the clamp a little.Totally garbage. Will keep myself far away this brand.
4,Good clamp for the price,"I buy clamps when ever i see a good deal. I am a true believer of ""You can never have too many clamps!)."
2,Not what expected,This pencil holder is of a good quality but for the price I paid is too small so I was a little bit upset with the purchase but you can win them all. Better as a paper clip holder
3,Not a bad low budget thriller,"I am usually skeptical of made-for-the channel movies, unless it's like HBO. IFC apparently made this, and I thought it was pretty good. It has some original scares and plot ideas, or at least I didn't notice any cliches. This is probably the best 'mirror' movie made in modern times, very much surpassing the theater movies 'Mirrors' and another I think I saw recently. They sure did more with less. It wasn't dirty either. They stuck to the story and it was all supernatural. Those looking to see another nudey flick with dumb characters you hope will get killed off, with just a minor horror subplot, will have to look elsewhere. I didn't like the woman playing the lead, though. I do not like that ER show she's in and I think she's ugly and kind of stupid. Her mouth hangs open almost the entire time. Sign of a low IQ. I guess you get who you get for a low budget flick, but the money they saved went into a good script and decent effects."
2,No-Go!,"I am a huge fan of suspense and horror. This didnt have any of those. I would have stopped watching this dvd 15min in but I was hoping to get a glimpse of some boobies. That moment never came. This movie is predictable and has some bad acting too. So ya know, I bought this dvd used for 2 bucks. I think I paid too much for it."
4,A Polanski kind of scary...,"Dark Mirror is one best horror flicks of 2009! It's scary but not the usual, banal 'blood and gore' scary - it's a Polanski kind of scary, a thinking person's horror film. The performances are fantastic and Lisa Vidal is mesmerizing. The scene in the bathroom where she's trying to convince her husband something is wrong with the house is absolutely brilliant - the kind of scene that is truly unforgettable, in that wonderfully unsettling way. Curious to see what this director does next because his talent really shines through despite the limitations of a presumably small budget. I think horror fans will definitely dig this flick - but I also think anyone who likes creative and intelligent filmmaking will appreciate it as well."
2,Atmospheric but without a horror punch,"This movie centers around a photographer who moves into a new home (with her family), then comes to believe that by photographing someone, that person will soon die. Obviously, there are questions of real cause and effect, insanity, reality, etc. The movie is generally well done, good production values, high image quality, etc., such that it feels high-ish budget (and that's a compliment). The mood throughout is creepy, and almost relentlessly so, never abating to anything else. The problem though, is that the film is never really scary. Sequences occur in which I think the director intended to elicit a scare among the audience, but it fails to do so in every scene. Not sure exactly why, but the climactic build just didn't work, and I do scare fairly easily. Bottom line, its a worthy rental, just don't expect an earth shattering horror."
2,Subpar horror/thriller/suspense with one glaring problem: not scary,"Dark Mirror is a decent effort at horror/thriller/suspense with a limited budget. By appearances and performances alone one would think this movie's budget was much more than the shoestring budget it probably had. Lisa Vidal is exotic and interesting as a bored housewife moving into a new home. When she takes a photo in a mirror, she soon realizes there are abnormalities in the glass reflections. She's tense throughout, but there is no tension. She's rattled enough to frantically search for, and compulsively suck on, numerous cigarettes. But it's never really that bad. Her limp, and stereotypical skeptical, husband is no more than a seat filler.It's one of those movies that has a lot of unrealized potential that would have been better in more competent hands. As it is, however, there are no scares, zero dread, and a feeling that it's much longer than it really is...which is not a good thing."
4,DVD Dark Mirror,The movie has alot of twists and was very enjoyable. I would recomend this to those who like a mystery suspense movie.
1,International wig is a rip off company,They Never sent me my order and are tring to keep my money. Its been one month now and no product and no refund. save the headace DO NOT ORDER FROM INTERNATIONAL WIG
5,"Awsome AI, awsome graphics,AWSOME GAME!","When I first played this game I was in aw. I mean the graphicsare awsome, the AI is purfect,and the car selection is great. Overall this game is great in so many ways, but their was a problem that I noticed-and that would be that the games weather is not on the dot cool as oh, let's say test drive 5. But go to it, go to it, buy the game-YOU'LL LOVE YOURSELF FOR IT"
5,great game,"This is a great game, have good graphics and you can be a cop and you can be a stealer you select whatever side of the law"
4,Need For Speed High Stakes,"Well i bet the other need for speed games are much better on playstation 2,but on the computer its pretty cool to.all you do in this one is race race and race.The good thing is that you get to pick what car u want,even a cop car!if u look on the back of the thing before u buy it,,well actully,by one point the back does look better then the game.I played this game many times and its great.Pther people say this game is bad because all u do is race and get bonos stuff,its actully the best racing game,other then nascar,i ever played.please listin to me what im tellin you is true.because once you by it your thank me."
4,very enjoyable game,really fun game I like out running the cops specially in the Trans Am my dream car .I just wish it were more chief .
2,An understanding of Native American background is necessary,"Winter in the Blood was a book I thought would be easier to understand than it was. Most of the chapters jump from one part of the main character's life to another. This makes the book semi-difficult to follow. In addition, throughout the entire book, the main character, who is the only narrator, is never given a name. The book starts out being slow and the point of the story is not understood until the end. However, the end was done very nicely and portrays that the story is about a young man that finds himself and overcomes his guilt and sorrow that he has felt for years due to losing the two people he cares about most- his brother and father. Winter in the Blood also demonstrates the difficulties of life that a Native American must face and how a person of this background can learn not only to accept, but also to be proud of this heritage."
3,Winter in The Blood,The book that I read was called Winter In The Blood by James Welch. This was a book about a character named Lame Bull and he is having visions about bad memories about things that have happened in the past and they are haunting him. These visions are about his brother dieing and his father freezing to death in the snow. he tries to figure out why these visions are bothering him so he goes to many different people. Then one guy says that he can tell him why these visons are haunting him and he also says that he can stop them.Then he goes to see the guy and they try to make them go away. Read this book to figure out if they succesfully make them go away or if they will not suceed
2,VERY bias,"Though informative, this book is VERY partial to MPLA's organization. I think it's great that Bittain was able to go to Angola, and see the civil war and its effects first hand, but she went with a division of MPLA (OMA) and only saw one side of the war. She presnst this angle wonerfuly, but i woul like to see a non bias, informative approach."
3,East Coast nostalgia,"Having the nostalgic urge to hear ""everready"", I discovered today that the entire ""trilogy"" of classic H2O albums combined takes up less space on the iPod than a few measley photographs...H20 tunes were always short and sweet, no-nonsense, take it or leave it stuff. Some of it's a little goofy and dated sounding now with countless group shout-outs and some forgetable repetitive verse-chorus verse chorus overkill, but a decade later looking back this band's passion is respectable. Musically the band always carried it's love for Gorilla Biscuits high above it's head, but they flirted with melody and pull it off fairly well at times. I felt they peaked as a band with this album back in the day... a fun band that treated it's fans great.The disks are still a charge to revisit 10 years later, though I gotta play them in my cubicle now (at a ""reasonable volume"").""One Life!"""
5,Faster Than Most...,"This is the album that got me into punk. Well, not strictly 'punk' but anyways...all I have to say is that if you ride BMX or skate then this album will be like a best friend to you.You can't help but want to ride as the title track starts up on your headphones. It makes you genuinely happy to be doing what you're doing and within a few weeks you'll know every single word, and get looked at funny as you ride round the skatepark singing it at the top of your voice.Yes, it really is that good. If you're beyond being all stuck up and 'hardcore' about your music then you'll love this. And so will your thirteen-year-old pop-loving sister...which is exactly the beauty of it. Any album that makes you this happy is worth a try, no?"
3,Very Good Album...,"Alright, I reviewed this album on the day I got it I think, and I over-praised it, I do believe. Although this album has some fantastic songs, there are definitely some songs that I skip. A couple songs are just lacking something. But, none the less, this is a very good album, although I would have to say that the self-titles album is their best effort all the way through. Definitely worth the purchase, though."
2,sad to say but ...,"I'm sorry but I can't get into this cd, I really liked the two others H2O releases, and this is for me the biggest disapointment of the year.I hope the next one will be better"
2,Still not even close,"I just got home from seein these guys for about the billionth time. H2O never disappoints with a live show but they've failed to impress me with either of their epitaph releases. they're definitely one of the best bands in hardcore but they just sound like pop punk now. the intensity is gone. i hate to say anything bad about these guys but there's no way around it. they're not bringin it. buy the first record if you don't have it, but just leave this one alone. and by the way, if you like either this one or Thicker Than Water better than the first album, that's fine, but please don't make the mistake of considering yourself hardcore."
3,A few issues...,"I bought this bike trailer recently and returned it. I have never seen one for sale in the bike stores around where I live so I did not know what to expect. The trailer looks really cool, I liked the colors. It was very sturdy and there was plenty of room for one child. I actually thought it was too large, bacause I got a one child trailer so it would be smaller. The folding system was really easy to use and most of the parts seemed high quality. The trailer is way too clunky and large to be a jogger or even a stroller. The major reason I returned this trailer is because the restrainiing system is very weak. The straps are made of very low quality material and loosen when the child moves."
5,Failry simple!,"First, one caveat, my child has not ridden in the product. I have put it together and that was fairly simple. It's very easy to switch between stroller, jogger and trailer. It looks comfortable inside and appears to be a quality product. Wheels require air, which is great. I intend to take it out as a trailer in the next couple of weeks, I will update then."
4,Road Rash 3-D PSX Review,"This is a nostalgic game to me, therefore (I assume) it is more fun and enjoyable to me than it is to some people. However, if I liked it then, and I still enjoy it with my recently refined taste in video games, I'm sure you'll like it too."
5,"Great, csardas, best so far.",This is the best fast paced Hungarian music that I found. THey have another CD for which I am looking for. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes fast (csardas) music.
5,Best cookbook ever!,"This cookbook came with my first Cuisinart over 20 years ago. It is still the cookbook I turn to first. I have never been disappointed with any of the recipes. Abby has the best way to make cakes that come out perfect every time. I am not much of a cook, but thanks to Cuisinart Classroom, people are very impressed. Also - one of the best ratatouille recipes ever!Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7-Cup Food Processor"
2,Cuisinart,It is little dated. I was hoping more modern book. I should looked closer! Too bad I saw a better book.
3,The Real Story About Marvin Gaye?,"I found the book insightful in some ways, with Frankie Gaye's stories behind the songs, Marvin Gaye's personal relationships with his wives, etc. However, at times, I felt Gaye was still holding something back, and not fully disclosing the real Marvin Gaye, warts and all."
2,Expecting More,"God rest the souls of the Gaye brothers. In reading this book, I thought I would find the closure in peicing together where Marvin's life starting going chaotic, but I did not find that. Everything written in this memoir pretty much repeated what Marvin wrote in his. I know at one point, there was a feud between Frankie and his older sister, who had differing views of their upbringing. Maybe she will write a book and we can get closer insight."
2,Not the best read.,I was disappointed in this book. Frankie Gaye did not tell all the facts especially about how Marvin was killed. Why would the police refuse to enter the home and let Marvin lay their bleeding to death? Something about that just does not ring true.
3,good & informative,I enjoyed the book. It put aside some myths that I had about what happened to Marvin It also explained a lot of why things happened as they did. I especially enjoyed the insight into the Motown atmosphere & the times in which Marvin lived.
4,Better Insight,"This is the second book I have read about Marvin. This book had far more insight as it was written by his brother. Very good reading for fans of Marvin, Motown or Music."
3,"Odd, but interesting","The music of Trunk Federation is quite different, it is very moody with hints of surrealism. Their sound is unique, a blend of manic pop with some strange vocals. Though, most of the album is not anything to get excited about. Not really bad, but not really special."
1,Waterford Colleen Glass,This is the picture of what I ordered but it is not what I got. I got a sherbert glass. I had to send it back and with insurance it cost me $10.00. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Do I want to reorder? No! Someone was not paying attention when the glass was selected and shipped.
2,Not for the serious listener.,"The collection of songs from the various Bond movies is fun but the engineering and sound quality are so poor that this CD is almost painful to listen to. Very flat, way too bright. A dissapointment."
4,NOBODY WAS INNOCENT!!!,"What a book. It was very, very good. I gave it four stars for a couple of reasons. I did not like the beginning. I was totally confused for the first several pages. Where were about five different stores going at one time. Finally, they got all tied together. On pages 208 and 209, paperback, it was crazy over the description of a car. No one could follow that bunch of numbers. I really liked the book except for those two things. I did not want to put it down after it really got started. It will keep you reading fast in order to see what is going to happen. David Nash is great as a defense attorney. His morals leave a lot to be desired, but he is a good attorney until he meets his match in Tom Gault. If you like legal thrillers you must read this."
5,Wonderful book!,Definitely a great read! I am thrilled to find an author that puts effort into a great ending- and doesn't let the suspence drop!
4,Good Read,"I am reading, and in some cases re-reading, Philip Margolin's books in order. I find that each of his books has a little different twist unlike the very formulaic books of many prolific writers. Quick reads but good reads all."
4,Fast Paced Legal Thriller,Phillip Margolin has created in David Nash a character that is both likable and admirable. He is a talented defense attorney who is beginning to have second thoughts about all the clients he has successfully represented who are probably guilty. Now he has a client that he believes is innocent. The situation is complicated by the attraction that develops between Nash and the client's wife. As time goes on evidence develops that suggest that the client might indeed be guilty. There are also the ethical considerations about the situation in which he now finds himself. The story develops with many plot twists and surprises and keeps the reader's interest all the way through to the exciting conclusion.
3,Good Read - Less than exciting ending,"As always Margolin is an attention holding author, but the ending to this and most of his others are almost pre-written a thousand times over... Boy gets girl, flys off to wonderland."
4,What happens to lawyers who continually defend the guilty,"Phillip Margolin has done it again, this time he puts you inside the lawyers head. The big-time lawyers who are always defending the gulity that have enough money (OJ). Well this time it back fires, If you would like to see what could possibly happen to Johnnie Cochran this is a must read"
2,Last Innocent Man,"Not up to his usual suspense orsurprise ! If took me a long timeto finish, I had already figured mostof it out before I was half way thru.Kind of disappointed."
5,Wonderful book if your like mysteries.,"Phillip Margolin is a great author. I could not put the book down. His way of writing keeps you interested and it is difficult to put the book down for even a second. Once you start, you can't stop."
4,Delbert come back home at Austin City Limit TV show!,"What a such pleasure to hear the Texas king of rythm'n blues,rock'n'roll,funk,honky-tonk,etc...17 years later after his first awsome so good cd""live"" in this same TV live show recordind! everything is good:Delbert,the musicians,the ""repertoire"",the hot ""ambiance"" on stage and for theaudience,BUT why to have put far-away in the mix this poor drummer?while you so exciting to put the cd in your cd player and wait for avery great show if you like D.Mac Clinton,what a bad surprise as you'rehearing a soft and ""mashmallow"" sound and entertainment just because thisdrumer is almost out of the mix!!!"
3,Travel Water heater,This is a handy item for making tea on the road. It fits neatly into the car between the front seats and plugs into the cigarette lighter. It has two cups that are stored in the jug. The only problem is that it takes half an hour to boil 2 cups of water. That is much too long and meant that we never actually used it on our trip.
1,Poor,"This is my second Travel Water Heater for car. Both units only lasted for about ten uses then died. On taking a closer look at my second unit after it died, it look as if it was wired for a 240/120 volt circuit and not a 12/24 volt circuit (internal wiring too thin). For the price and the fact it is CE certified I'm not impressed. I expected a better product with CE certification."
2,Painfully slow,This thing takes soooooo long to heat water. I'd say only buy it if you're desperate and have no other way to heat water. And leave lots of time before you need that water to be heated!
4,Saul is Consistent,"I have read a lot of John Saul books. When I bought this one I was worried that I would be burnt out on the same writer. However, Saul maintains a high standard in storytelling. Even if you can guess the plot, the way the story moves is always entertaining. Saul is consistently good."
4,"The Horror, The Horror","John Saul's Second Child is the first horror book I ever read. (6+years ago) At my younger age I had trouble with some of the bigger words and darker concepts, but it was the best Saul I've ever read (and consequently the only).Poor Melissa is having problems growing up and being accepted and generally--um--psychological others. Teri comes into her life ostensibly as a friend, but Teri has problems of her own...Of everything literary branded into my mind, there will always be an image of Teri's mother hanging from a second-story window of a burning building and then doing a faceplant on the concrete below.I can thank Saul for that--err--lovely imagery. Don't doubt though, it's a great book and I would submit, for starters.I have genuinely loved horror as a genre ever since Second Child. It is a worthy book and will quiver you."
5,A suspensful and horrifying story of a fathers two daughters,"A girls house is burned down, leaving her mother and step father dead. Her real father has a daughter, and comes down to get her."
5,Second Child,"I like the suspence, I was totally spellbound. Also didn't know it was the mother until the end. I truly enjoy the way John writes."
4,Good stuff!!,"I'd forgotten how much fun a John Saul novel could be...and ""The Second Child"" was a great reminder!Not a horror novel, exactly. More along the line of mystery/suspense/thriller...with a plot revolving around a 13 year old girl, her half sister, a wicked mother and a doting father. Saul takes us to Secret Cove, Maine~a small, exclusive, wealthy village full of affluent parents and their spoiled children. Melissa Holloway hasn't ever quite fit in but her half sister Teri, who moves in after a horrific family tragedy on the west coast, seems to mesh perfectly.But something is amiss in the Holloway household. The dog, Blackie, feels it. The housekeeper, Cora, senses it.Just WHO is it, or WHAT is it that isn't...'quite right' in the family?And what about D'Arcy, Melissa's friend and confidant?Hasn't SHE been dead for nearly a century?"
5,Rainy Night Ghost Story,"It has a bunch of shocking twists and that amusing ghost story added to it. Perfect for a rainy night all alone in the dark. But not so bad where you cant sleep...Second Child had a satisfying ending. Something that left me with a deep breath of that ""All's well that ends well"" .... But then with what really happened to all the others, I was sad there was no part 2...."
4,Psychologically thrilling but somewhat predictable,"My first John Saul book. I've been avoiding buying a novel of his for fear I would just have to buy many more. This novel convinced me I need to read more of his work. He is a master at creating sympathy for the characters, making it tough to endure what happens to them. A good read. My only problem was the somewhat predictable plot."
2,Very Dissapointed,"When I came across this book and read the back panel I couldn't wait to read it! The story sucked me right in and I was glued for two days not wanting to put it down. There is no doubt the writer has a great way with words. However the closer and closer I got towards the end of the book though with absolutely nothing juicy happening (for ""revenge"")I started to get annoyed. For a 355 page book that had so much potential to be wrapped up in 9 pages that explain NOTHING I think was absolutely ridiculous, and I realize I'm not alone with my disappointment. I wish I would have checked into the disappointed reviews before I bought the book. I would not recommend the book to somebody else."
5,10300 Dodge Custom Towing Mirror,"The Dodge Custom Towing Mirror works great and gives you a clear view behind your tow vehicle. Unfortunately, I sold my 1996 Dodge pickup and now have two mirrors I don't need. Be glad to sell these mirrors."
5,really helped out,Purchased these for when we are towing our TT. Really helped out as they extended my vision down the sides of the trailer. Easy to install. Others have written about them coming off with the wind. Never had a problem with mine. Tighten down the screw and you are good to go.
5,title of review,"Good price, fast shipping, fits perfect, they had a little vibration around 65/70 but little enough to not cause problems, happy with the purchase"
2,poor view,I did not care for this product the cost was great but the functionality of them was poor they would not stay in adjustment.Also when you're used to having power mirrors it just is not fun with these.I might add if you're in a pinch one time usage would be good.
2,cipa mirror,I was unable to get it to tighten enough on the truck mirror. It kept coming loose. It was to replace the old style that the mirror was broken. I was able to switch the mirror part and use the old style again.
3,Good for the price,"Pros:- Clear reception, priceCons:- Only one of the handsets can be used at a time- Speed-dial does not store enough numbers"
1,This phone is crap - they should have a NO STAR RATING,"I bought this phone for a gift. It is horrible. It pops and has major static problems, even if you are close to the base. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good phone but no mute button,"Great phone but I'm surprised to find that there's no way to hit mute while you are on teleconference calls and conversations. Every time you snore, your boss will hear you. ;)"
1,Get what you pay for,"This phone had poor sound quality. If all you want is a means to communicate as though holding a can with a string attached, this is great. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I have since purchased a phone system for over a hundred and it was worth every penny (threw away the uniden after a month of frustration!)"
5,Great for the money.,These are great no frills phones. They don't have alot of features such as an answering machine but they do the trick if you are not looking to spend alot of money.
5,Great phone!,"I was really shocked when I read the bad reviews of this phone. I have had my set for several months and have NEVER experienced any of the problems mentioned in other reviews. I do have to say that the way I have my phones arranged, the main one in the basement and the extra phone (the one that does not need to be plugged into a phone jack) in my bedroom, they happen to be right on top of each other, albeit on separate flooors- so maybe that has something to do with why my recpetion is so great. But again, I have never had any problems and think this is a great phone. I love the simple, sleek design and do not think it feels or looks cheap."
1,Worst phone I have ever used,"I have never had trouble with any other phone like I do with this one. Most of the time when the phone rings, the caller ID doesn't even work. It says ""Incoming Call"" or ""Incomplete Data"" when at the same time my Panasonic phone is showing me the correct name and number.There is always interference and you cannot go more than 10 feet away from the base without there being so much static/interference that you can't even hear the person.Yesterday when I was on it, myself and the caller could both hear beeping noises and static.The phone just feels cheap. Rather than trying to save a few bucks, go with something better it will be worth it."
4,Works like a charm,"I haven't had any problem with this phone at all. It works great for what I wanted a dual handset for,I use the dual handset so I can use my Vonage phone service on either end of the house. It works just fine for that purpose."
1,Don't buy this phone,"I purchased this phone based on the Consumer Reports high rating of this phone. Phooey! It is very difficult to hear the caller, even with the volume up all the way. The static appeared about 2 months after initially hooking up the phone. It is so bad, you cannot hear the caller at all. I wish I would have stayed with Panasonic... My old phones have all been Panasonic and they worked great. I got this one because of the great price and favorable review in CR. Big mistake..."
1,Static Static,"I admit I purchased this phone for the price and I am very sorry I did. I currently have a Siemens phone system (2.4ghz) and I wanted to upgrade, as the Siemens has very few features. I purchased the Uniden and found that it was impossible to hear on the phone due to a great deal of static and clicking. I attempted another call standing right next to the base unit and I STILL could not hear anything. I had charged the phone for the required 20 hours before using but I cannot even make a single call on the phones. I am very disappointed and I have the impression that a 900mhz analog phone would be better than this one."
2,Should have bought new.....,"I thought this was a good deal for my kids to have cordless phones, but the reception is not all that great, and the price wasn't that much cheaper than other phones. I guess they are good enough for the kids, but I would definitely not want to use them daily myself."
5,AWSOME GAME EVER!,This is a very fun game for my Play Station. I was able to play my new game in the car while we were going home. 3D graphicsare great for the system. So race this new game on your TV orusing a LCD screen to connect to your console.
5,Need For Speed 3: Hot Pursuit,The options in the game let you set the car up for your style ofdriving.
2,NO COP???,"High Stakes is definately a better game... If you enjoy being a cop against the computer, then go for this one.. if your thinking of becoming a speed demon then go for this. I also recomend renting it first.. graphics / sound suck."
3,Not as good at the PC Version!,"Even though my friend and I love playing the game, there are a couple drawbacks to this one. One, the graphics aren't as good as the PC version. Two, you can't be the cops which is what I love in the PC version. Three, there aren't that many cars to choose from. This is the main reason why I gave this game three stars. I can think of a ton of more cars to put in this game. This is the same flaw in the PC version. Not enough cars.All in all, this a good racing game but the PC version is ten times better."
4,need for speed 3,This is one of the greatest racing games that I have ever played. You can race in one or two player modes and you get to outrun both your partner and the cops (which makes this game so great) so if you have a little rebel in you then you will like this game
4,Great little tool for bangs and/or thin layers,"This is a great little tool! It heats up fast and evenly. However, it is not really a flat iron. The plates are slightly curved, so it is really hard to get a ""stick straight hair"" look. Also, it is not full sized and it heats up umm . . . probably not much more than 200*F, so it does not stand a chance against thick or super-curly hair, but it is great for thin hair, shorter layers, or bangs. I would totally recommend this product!"
1,Not worth it,"This product was NOT worth getting. I wanted something for touch ups, but when starting the butane heater, I waited 5 mins and it wasn't even hot to the touch. I could leave my fingers on the iron for days and it wouldn't bother me! If you want something for touch ups for travel,camping etc I recommend looking into the hot tools cordless iron, it heats up much better."
4,Good Value for money,"This is great to touch up your hair in the car or at work. It does not get as hot as a full size flat iron, but it does the job."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this recently because the idea of a cordless straightening iron appealed to me. (I thought it would be great for camping). But I didn't like this unit at all. It comes with a butane cartridge that has to be screwed onto the back of the unit. The ignition button has to be pressed again and again until it finally starts up the unit. There is no indication when the unit is ready to use, so I waited and waited, but it never got warm enough to straighten out anything. My hair is slightly wavy, but very fine, so it doesn't take much to straighten it, but this thing didn't make any difference whatsoever. I could barely feel any heat on my hair at all. And, I also have to add that it smelled like butane, which I really didn't like. This useless little device is definitely going back..."
2,Not enough storage space.,"This camera case is fine if you want to use it only for a compact camera. However, if you would like to have a pocket for your film, or for your camera's memory card, and possibly a pocket for your batteries, this case will be insufficient. The small mesh pocket seems nearly worthless, with barely enough room for two AA batteries."
2,Too big for the Stylus,"Fine case for the money, but far too big for the Olympus Stylus digital cameras."
4,Does the job,"The case perfectly fits my Olympus D-550. I can sqeeze two SmartMedia cards and their cases in the side mesh pocket. It's a vinyl case and doesn't really offer too much protection. And anything in the mesh pocket is completely exposed. Given the option again, I would have gone for a thicker, sturdier case, but this is still an adequate case for now, and worth the price."
1,Where did this movie leave God?,"Save your money. This piece of New Age film craft (it has nothing to do with art) will leave you wondering why you blew your money on this. The storyline will let you down time after time - no self-responsibility, no hope, no redemption. God is mentioned only in the title line, otherwise this movie is as Darwinistic, and atheistic as it gets. Message: your poor, your without sense, there is no hope! The title is a masquerade there is nothing Christian about this Hollywood attack on belief."
5,Just let yourself go and enjoy the music!,"2002 has done it again...I am totally hooked on their superb music. There is such a gentleness and calmness about this CD that just let's you ""take WINGS"" and fly. I am a Massage Therapist and I have clients that request now that I play this CD...it seems to let them take a deep breath, close their eyes and go to a place of peace and calmness. I highly recommend this CD."
2,Got a bad one.,"Tripod was OK for about 3 uses, until I tried to adjust the angle with the tilt handle (long handle that you unscrew to tilt the camera). Broke on third use.Maybe they're not all crap, but mine was."
3,Lousy Description,I agree with the other gentleman. I wanted Flim Flam Man and instead I got movies we already have. This was supposed to have 3 movies on it and I am really disappointed with Amazon. I have been ordering forever and this is the first time I have been let down.
1,Ouch! This stuff HURTS!,"Good golly! This stuff is like pouring concrete or cement on your face!! You won't be ripping this off to quickly or you will be pulling the top layer of your tender skin with it (like I did)! I followed the directions and put it on half of my upper lip. Oh, the pain, ouch! And did I DREAD having to place it on the other half of my lip... so needless to say I will NEVER try this product again. My advice to you is to find another, more gentle product for your face or anywhere else for that matter."
4,Works well and it's pretty cheap,"I read horrible reviews of this product on another site and was hesitant to buy it, but it was so cheap that I figured I didn't have much to lose. It worked really well. There were a few short, fine hairs that it missed, but it was much better than several other products I've tried, including Nads and a couple of Sally Hansen products. The biggest disadvantage is that it took a really long time to heat - nearly five minutes in a 1,000-watt microwave - so the turntable in the microwave got really hot (but the wax and container were ok)."
2,ehhh,"nothing special here it did remove some of my hairs on my upper lip and i think that to get a perfect smooth result you may have to go over a few times. the little sized bottle prob wouldnt last very long either. i wasnt upset with this product but i wasnt satisfied either, i will not be purchasing this again i recommend facial hair remover creams instead."
2,Why Americans Really Don't Vote,"Piven and Cloward continue to avoid the real causes and consequences of low turnout. ""Why Americans Still Don't Vote,"" as with their other works, is motivated not by intellectual curiosity, but a political agenda. For those unsatisfied by this polemic, see Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) or Ruy Teixeira (1987 and 1992)."
2,Just an OKAY film,"Do not judge foreign films based on this movie because there are plenty of great foreign movies out there.The movie was not appealing at all. It took place mostly in one location...Fred's house. ""How boring!"" Also, it lacked emotional depth, no real excitement or thrill."
1,waste of time and energy,"do NOT waste your time to watch this!It started off somewhat ok, but toward the end it got so confusing and stupid!And the acting was not that great either.The main female was so ugly, she looked like a skinny boy.What a stupid film!It left me angry at myself I watched the whole thing ;-[[[["
3,ring ring!,"Make PeeWee Herman proud!Nice ""ring ring"" sound. Loud. Mine came in black. Sometimes (rarely) the lever gets stuck in, aka it doesn't spring back on its own. But for the price I can't complain too much. I just ""unstick"" it with my finger and we're back in action."
1,Cheap piece of junk - broke after 1 month,"Bought this bell to have something on my bike to warn pedestrians of my presence. After a little over a month, the bell is broken. The lever doesn't ring the bell and just makes a harsh grating noise.I guess it's my fault for buying it b/c Schwinn is a cheap junk brand. They stole my Cannondale b/c I tried to save a couple of bucks and bought a Schwinn lock, now this bell I bought and IT'S broken. Since it's over a month, Amazon is no help on the return.Learn from my mistakes and don't buy this or any Schwinn product."
5,Bike Bell,Sounds just like the one I had as a kid. Gave it a little girl to put on her bike. Fun and safe at the same time.
2,Rings over every bump,"Looks nice and sounds nice, easy to install. Main grip: every little bump on the road causes it to chime, have to hold thumb on it to mute it as it goes off almost constantly. A pretty lousy design defect."
3,Built well but does not always sound good,This bell is metal which gives it the appearance of being sturdy. The trigger is stiff and does not glide smoothly. The bell also sounds muted frequently. I have to play with it to get it sounding right.
1,Does not fit road bikes,"It claims to fit most bikes, but is far too small to fit a drop-bar road bike handlebar. It is fragile and not very loud.At best, this is an overpriced toy."
1,Broke right away,"This bell was a great price, but the first time I tried to push the lever for a ring, it made a crunching noise inside and got stuck. It never worked once for a ring. I brought it to my uncle for fixing, but because the gears were all plastic inside, he wasn't able to fix it. Next time I will buy a better bell."
4,classic design,Love the classic look and sound even though it is a little large than some bells that are just as loud.
1,Does not tolerate teenager use,"Its inside are plastic made and easy to fall off. With just one use from my son's friend, it broke."
2,bell is too big,"I thought i was ordering a small bell..this one is about 3-4"" in diameter. My mistake, i didn't look closer...the image gave me an impression of a smaller bell."
5,Its a bell,"Its a bike bell, not much to say really, I received it, installed it and it rings when you slide the lever. It is plastic though and I do not know if that was missing from the description or it I missed it."
4,A nice little bell,"This is a very nice bell real easy to put on,I gave it 4 stars because I think it would have been nice to chose your own color."
3,Nice but?,"Just received my schwinn bell, it looks like the one pictured but it's a lot larger than expected, the sound is ok, but for the price I'm not complaining, at first look it appeared that you could only mount in on the left side, it being that the schwinn logo would be upside down if you were to place it on the right side and also the lever only goes one way and then retracts there by creating the sound but you just simply twist the cap with the logo to have it upright and it's done, had this bell cost more I would return it because it's just too big for my liking but I'll give it a try and see how it works out, if you don't mind having a large bell protruding from your handle bar then it's fine, you get what you pay for, I'm only giving this three stars, minus one for the size and another because I'm not crazy about the sound either, a simple bling would have been sufficient"
2,Poor Typesetting,"I find it hard to believe that with software and computers available to the authors and publisher in 1999, this book can look like a book published in the 50's and 60's. For me, this makes the book difficult to read. Have these guys ever heard of Latex? It was precisely developed for academics who do technical writing with professional results. This book resembles a very bad Word document. In my opinion, regardless of how good the content, there is no excuse for the lack of effort in presentation style. All I can say is that there are no shortage of great coding books that have better coverage than this book, all with FAR better modern typesetting, i.e. Lin and Costello, Todd Moon. I'm real disappointed considering that the first author was a leading researcher in the field. 2 stars and I'm being generous."
3,No cubtitles necessary,"I own a set concluding all the disks mentioned separately of Billy Connolly's World Tour:(Billy Connolly: Live in New York, Scotland and England, Australia and NZ).His perfect classic English pronunciation needs no subtitles also this DVD function is possible, jocks are funny as humour is understandable, and shows equipped with nice sightseeing of countries he was performing in."
1,Be careful what you order,"This DVD is playable only on PAL systems, not the North American format. Caiman won't give me a refund!"
3,It's Ok,"He is much better to listen to on Howard Stern. I was not impressed by his standup, but I bet seeing him in real life would completely change my mind."
3,Artie needs better material,"Artie is a likable chap. He runs circles around JACKIE THE BROKE MAN MARTLING,and was a perfect addition to the Howard Stern crew. But, if this is his best standup stuff; He's not much of a comic. He is a funny feller, but alot of his bits drag. Lange is pretty fearless, saying the N-word, talking trash about gays, and admitting(as well as exploring) his many demons(problem gambling, problem drinking, problem coke snorting, problem crapping one's pants on smack). Great comics do have big ugly Demons-Maybe this DVD caught him on a crap night. He seems to be stalling many times...his pacing is wobbly. The crowd hoot and hollor, because they're a bunch of those ""YEAAAH!!!!PARTY!!!!!LOOK AT ARTIE DRINK!!!!WHEEEW!!!!-type of turkeys. Maybe you should be drunk in order to fully appreciate this seemingly mediocre set. I like this DVD, but I think Artie has better stuff up his sleeve. Maybe im just a jerk. I dunno."
3,Fire!!!!!,"I like Artie on the Howard Stern Show, but his standup is basically yelling ""Fire!"" and making other references to his jokes on the Stern show when his normal routine doesn't get any major laughs. I was a little dissapointed, because I honestly think Artie is so much better when he's calmer, i.e., not drunk, and not pandering to a drunken crowd that equates humor with simply yelling profanities. I was not offended by the profanity, I just think swearing with no real joke attached is just lazy and pointless."
1,Rather listen to his stories on the Stern show,I guess I enjoyed the clean version of Artie's life stories from the Stern terrestrial radio show. The foul language only detracted from his comedy.
1,Artie Lange It's the Whiskey Talking,"What a waste of money. I fell asleep during the performance. He should not have wasted his time and money putting this together the routine is weak, and not very funny. If you listen to the Howard Stern Show then dont buy this you already have heard it all from the show. FIRE!!!, is his way to get the crowd to react when he is bombing on stage."
2,"Artie is funny on Howard, BUT.....","...when he has to carry his own show, it falls pretty flat. I love Artie on Howard, he makes so many funny comments and observations, but thats when he is only chiming in once in a while. On this DVD, he is in the spotlight, and has no one else (like Howard and the gang) to fall back on. I was expecting a HILARIOUS stand-up routine from Artie, on par with Chris Rock, and what I got was a DVD that didn't make me laugh out loud once. Sure, I smiled several times, was amused several times, but no real laughs. Ironically, after watching this DVD I watched Larry The Cable Guy's DVD (which I thought would be HORRIBLE) and laughed about 40 times. I expected a lot more from Artie. The DVD isn't BAD, its just not very funny. At all. And that's coming from a big fan of the Stern show. At under $10 though, it can't hurt to try it and see if you agree with me."
3,A Bargain At Under $10,"Artie Lang certainly gives bang for the buck here. You get very good stand up, a short film of his, and behind the scenes footage. That's better than most DVDs.This is typical Artie, he's usually pretty bombed, witty, and funny. During a skit where he expalins how he is the only white guy playing basket ball with blacks and uses a racial slur when asking one of the other players to throw him the ball, I had to rewind several times until I finished laughing. Very funny stuff.The overall feel of the DVD is somewhat amatuerish. It is not a high quality production, but it doesn't skimp on humor. If you're looking for a slick DVD made by a huge film crew, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a few good laughs at an affordable price, pick this up."
3,I actually would give it a 3.5,I love Artie's stand up.I listen and watch Artie and others on the Howard Stern show on sirius. I really like Artie's stand up routine but I think they could have done a better job of producing a more interesting video. A lot of the video seems almost like a home movie with Artie talking about his life as a comedian. Overall its a pretty good dvd but I don't know how many times I will watch it in the future.
3,BUEN DISCO DE MERENGUE!,"Recomiendo este CD a los merengueros de verdad. Esto es merengue pa'l bailador. Fuera de Liga es un muy buen grupo. Los mejores temas del disco son ""Si tu quisieras"" (tema original de Luis Fonsi), ""Amores como el nuestro"" (tema original de Jerry Rivera), ""No me conoces"" (tema original de Marc Anthony) y ""Livin la vida loca"" (exito original de Ricky Martin). Si eres merenguero de verdad te recomiendo los siguientes CD's: ""Natural"", ""Me gusta todo de ti"", ""Jessica Cristina"" y ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""Grupomania 2050"" de Grupo Mania, ""Te lo dejo a ti"" de Laura y ""Vuelve"" de Edwin Rivera."
3,Shield Hockey Stick,The stick did not arrive as pictured. It was solid red. I thought it was supposed to have a white handle with a red blade! It looks like a preschoolers stick!
3,Usual committee-written stuff,"The rage nowadays is multi-authorship. The result--as here--is an irregular and unbalanced study. Some of the essays--notably those by the editor--are quite good. Some are technical studies. Some are just plain bad writing. All in all, a mixed bag"
4,IT in the UK is like IT here !,"Typical IT dept. The grunts know the PCs, and management knows, well, not much. If you work in IT, or, are major geek, you'll love it. There are only 24 shows, 4 seasons of 6 each, and the quality of the stories varies greatly. Some are office bound, some, you wouldn't know that they worked in an office. Still, if you fall into the.IT/geek crowd, I think you'll love it."
5,Quirky humor,we've really enjoyed it. The characters really play off each other well. Unexpected really funny quirky humor comes from somehow outrageously believable situations. Recommend for those with an open mind.
2,Not a value,"Don't get me wrong this show is absolutely amazing and one of my favorites of all time. So for the show it is easily a 5 star rating but this complete series product to me is ridiculous because of the price. you play $90+ and yet you get nothing extra for the money. you can buy all four seasons right now individually and pay only $57. As far as i can tell there is no exclusive bonus features to buying the show as a ""collection."" Once again to re-iterate this show is an amazing show and is deserving of 5 stars but this specific ""collection"" in my eyes is a waste of money since it is nearly twice as expensive as buying individual seasons and therefore gets a two star rating."
2,The IT Crowd-Complete Series 1-4 (DVD) UK Version,I was not aware of the fact that DVDs from the UK cannot be played on standard US dvd players. So my gift of this series to my son for Christmas is a major disapointment.
4,So far so good...,"When I moved a few months ago my bedroom had hardwood floors for the first time, being as my bed was on wheels it became annoying, especially since i had just painted the room and the corners of my headboard were rubbing on the wall every time someone got in or out of bed. These risers worked nicely to keep the bed in place, althought I can no longer just slide the bed away from the wall to make it, they dont slide across the floor, which i guess is the point."
3,does the job,"it does the job, but they have some kinda suction cup thing on the bottom and since i am using mine on tile, they dont make it easy to slide my couch or coffee table very well..."
4,Does intended purpose,"I really like that you can add just an inch at a time with these to make sure you end up with your desired height. They do seem to wiggle a bit now that I've had them for a while, but they definitely gave me the height I needed so that my daughter's bedspread no longer hangs on the ground!"
4,Works well,"Just make sure your beds wheels will fit right i this thing. Mine are the long wide ones(like in the picture). There is a small ledge in the riser, but it doesn't really keep the wheel in place well. The get a bit unstable if you use 2 of them to raise the bed up higher. Make its quite difficult to move the bed with these things installed."
2,"Nice music, poor video",One must buy this for the music. The video is only 15-20 minutes and repeated several times in each music part. I expected all different video for each music part.
3,Beautiful video and audio -- but boring.,"I give this one three stars -- and that is being generous, I believe. Why? Because, after about the first third of the video, the scenes keep repeating: the camera shots show the same portions of the earth over and over and over and over. There are only so many times that one can enjoy the sunrise on the horizon of earth, or the scenes of the desert (Middle East, it would appear), or cloud formations over the ocean. What's there is nice to see, but there needed to be much more variety than just seeing the same old thing over and over again. I think the editor of this product did a lousy job in not providing more shots than he did. The music was also nauseatingly repetitious. I would not recommend this film to anyone other than someone who might buy it to keep a cat or dog entertained for several hours while the owners were out shopping. I had expected much more than I got."
2,Underwhelming - BIG disappointment,"The video in Blu-ray is stunning. However, one might reasonably expect more from this video than the same video over and over and over with nothing more than a change in music played in the background.What a rip-off."
3,A View From Space with heavenly Music [Blu-ray],"I was very keen to receive this Blu-ray because of all the rave reviews. Well what a terrible shame and dissapointement, as for a start it has stunning views of our Earth, but the music is a complye load of crap and I could of done a much better job, so to me it was a complete waste of money and I have given the Blu-ray away to a friend.Mr. Andrew C. MillerLe Cinema Paradiso"
2,Oh well....,"I've watched hours of space shuttle video in real time. I was hoping for something like what I'd seen on the NASA channel. It wasn't to be. Personally I prefer to see recognizable land masses instead of interesting cloud formations. Also the colors of landmasses were often unnatural. It isn't far into the video that you will realize, ""hey! I saw that earlier"". It isn't an hour of video, it is an hour filled with watching the same disappointing short video over and over. Actually, the DVD was worth the price for the music alone. The music is great."
3,A heavenly purchase when having a HD DVD player,"View From Space With Heavenly Music [HD DVD]The Visual as well as Audio presentation is truly ""out of this world!"" It is fantastic that there are many choices of music. Very inspiring.Do be careful that you do have the proper HD DVD player. I bought this for both my aunt and uncle for their birthdays. It only worked for 1 and both supposedly had HD players. One was blue ray. It didn't work in this case."
4,Space HD,"This is a nice hd-dvd. The only problem I have with it, is that, what you see is the same rotation around the earth, time after time, as the music plays. I dont mind one video to many music tracks, but after the third rotation, you've seen the same terrain features already."
3,"Nice images, good music","I have been looking for a DVD with images from space and fantastic music that I saw on TV while on vacation in France about two years ago. I thought this was the DVD, but it was not. Nonetheless, this is a good DVD with nice images and good music. You get to choose the music collection you want to listen to (ie choose from one of the different audio tracks) while the video is the same for all."
4,It's Not One Hour of Video,"I purchased this video expecting stunning views from space, and I got that. But it was not ""one hour"" as advertized, rather it was a 3:45 launch sequence followed by 14:53 of original footage from space, followed by three repeats of about 14:30 each from the space view footage. Despite the claim in another user review, this repetition has nothing to do with consecutive orbits, it is merely re-use of the same footage. Even the most casual observer can notice the repetition of such distinctive scenes as a zoom-in on Mt Fuji, or the dumping of the urine holding tank. I would have given this disc a five-star rating if it had the promised hour of original video. As it is, the crystal-clear views from space and the 8 hours of great 5.1 surround music warrant a four-star rating. As a relatively new Amazon customer, I have found by experience that it pays to check out the customer reviews, as they will tell you things the promotional information will not."
5,This WORKHORSE takes STUNNING pictures!,"After much research, I recommended the DC280 for my friend's company almost three years ago, and since then it has taken THOUSANDS of pics, most of them STUNNING good color and clarity. Whether taken inside or outside, of products, people or nature shots, the DC280 seemed to handle everything we threw at it - including getting DROPPED several times and getting WET and DIRTY on numerous occasions (not that I recommend it). Recently my friend bought a Canon G2 and GAVE me his ""old"" Kodak DC280 - and it STILL takes stunning pictures as if it was brand new! Therefore, if you can find a good used DC280 or DC290 for a decent price, I can GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed with the durability of the camera or the quality of the pictures!"
4,Terrific camera - easy to use - fabulous pictures,"We bought this camera several years ago and have taken it with us on two trips abroad and many trips around the USA. I'm not a camera maven but I've just had a terrific experience with this camera. Our pictures come out clear and sharp. It is easy to use. The color is great. The camera feels good in my hands. Mine came with a 32 mb card and I bought one extra 32mb card. I can travel for weeks at a time without ever worrying about ""film."" I've even dropped the camera by accident a few times without breaking it. The flash works nicely in a variety of light. If I had to find one thing to criticize I would pick the zoom lens but I have yet to see a competitive product with a better one. In short, I've taken thousands of pictures with the camera without a hitch. In fact, I usually have a big smile on my face when I see the results. And my friends and family do too."
4,"Good resolution and beautiful menues, useless for my work!","I thought I had read all information about this product prior to purchase it. A good thing: its very nice LCD and menu interface. Two bad things: USB seems no working on my Intel D815EEAAL motherboard, and it renders awfull colors and details when trying to take pictures of flowers and plants (that's why I bought it). Thou its macro feature is fine, it seems the camera cannot balance colors when the composition is very colorful. It has customizable and automatic white balance option that behave weird, and your setting is not saved on the preferences, it changes to ""automatic white balance"" each time you turn it on. I think its a great camera for fancy pictures, portraits or any image with diversified colors."
5,This is one great camera,"I'm not a novice when it comes to digital cameras. This is my third, and it is, by far, the finest digital I've ever seen. To me, a good camera is one that takes good pictures. That makes the 280 a remarkable camera, because the output is truly remarkable. With a good printer, the photos from the Kodak DC280 rival those of the finest 35 mm cameras. If I wanted to be ""picky,"" I could fault this camera for short battery life, but I don't. The answer to that criticism is simple. Carry a set of extra rechargeable batteries, and You'll be prepared for that once in a lifetime shot when it presents itself. I recommend this camera with no hesitation."
5,"Stunning pictures, indoors and out","This is a remarkable camera, not because of the features, but because the pictures it produces. This is actually my third digital camera. Prior to the Kodak 280 zoom, I had a Canon A5, followed by a Canon A50 zoom. I bought the Kodak 280 zoom on a lark, after reading that the pictures were stunning. They are. I've been printing 8 by 10's that are absolutely remarkable. I couldn't be more pleased. I would recommend this camera to anyone. The only fault I can find is that the camera eats batteries, but I'll gladly trade the inconvenience of charging and changing batteries for the quality prints this camera produces, inside and outside. It's a little marvel."
4,Best bang for the buck...,"Overall I love this camera. Picture quality is awesome. If you turn off the LCD preview feature, I've found my batteries to last a long time. Get the carrying case and pack along an extra set just in case though.Cameras are coming now with only 8mb cards, so make sure you get a bigger card to hold hi-res photos. The 8mb does only about 12 hi-res pictures. Get batteries, get the AC adapter as well.Kodak just released Win2000 drivers also.Unfortunantly, my camera died the other day. Lost power. It's being sent back to Kodak for repairs. Hopefully I won't have any more problems with it. It comes with a 1 year warranty."
3,A real world comparison,"I have used three cameras lately: 1) Sony DSC-505 2) Olympus C-2020 3) Kodak DC280 All three have 2.1 Megapixel and good lenses. The Sony is the only one with no Zoom, but has the best picture quality and the best lowlight exposure. There is also the DSCF505 which has the huge 3xzoom lens, but it is too big to be nice. The Sony is also the smallest and the easiest to use. The operating system is similar to the DV camcorders. The second best is the Olympus C-2020 due to its zoom lens, the viewfinder and just weaker in low light conditions. The 130 pictures will fit onto a 64MB Smartmedia in HQ, a little more than with Sony. The Kodak I liked the least, mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors (in comparison). I currently use the Olympus for professional work and the Sony due to its breast pocket size to snap great photos anywhere and anytime."
2,It works just like it should!,"I have owned 3 or 4 of these cameras, my first one was quite by accident, received it in payment for driving for someone. The second one did not do to well, this one that I got from Amazon works JUST LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED to work, it took me through a 50 year high school reunion with shining colors!! It was interesting to photograph all around this boarding school, many things had changed, but many were similar or the same. I have MANY pictures now that I can look at to remind me of my 50th anniversary of my graduation. Thanks, Amazon, you did well!!Richard L. Opp (thoseopps@yahoo.com)"
4,"Nice, with reservations","The DC280 is a nice little camera, but the results I get from it aren't any better than those from oy old DC210 that it replaced. In fact, I find the autofocus to be less accurate, or at least harder to use than with the 210. And, alas, it STILL eats batteries by the ton."
4,"Nice First Impression, But Get To Know Him","After careful consideration, our family bought a Kodak DC-280.This camera looks great- USB, zoom, LCD panel, many features-- but get to know it. While USB is nice, not all computers have it, and Windows 98 is necessary. Also the 30-60mm zoom is no where near as good as I would have liked-- DEFINETLY a 3x zoom is required. While the resolution is nice, remember that that's not all to a digital camera."
3,The good the bad and the ugly!,"The Good: Picture Quality, Camera ease-of-use.The Bad: File Transfer from camera to hard drive.The Ugly: Adobe PhotoDeluxe that comes with the camera.Overall, because of the great picture quality, I give it 3/5 stars."
4,A Question,Does anyone know if this camera has a timer setting so you can set it up and take pictures automatically?
1,Extremely disappointed in the DC280,"I've had the DC280 for a little over a week and am VERY disappointed. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?, but I've yet to take a photo that resulted in a high quality image. In particular, shots taken at medium distance are fuzzy, grainy, and generally unsatisfactory. I'm just totally perplexed. Everything I had read said that the images were excellent---but mine are just miserable. I've spent hours studying the manual and reading the photo tips on Kodak's web site - but nothing seems to help. I gave the camera a ""one star"" rating, which, under the circumstances, is very generous. Maybe it's a defective item?"
4,Great Beginner Digital Camera,"I teach photography and thought this would be a great digital camera to introduce to those hesitant to jump into the digital age. I have owned since November and have taken over 300 pictures. My review follows. The great--- 1. Picture quality is awesome!!! 2. The weight of the camera feels sturdy. Whereas, some higher priced models weigh the size of a piece of paper. The good--- 1. Storage with the generic memory card is good. Invest in a larger memory card and your set. 34MB is perfect. (About 60 more images) 2. Battery life has not been a problem at all. I did buy another set of rechargable batteries because of other customer reviews. The average--- 1. Zooming in to objects can be somewhat limited but is adequate. This product rates 4.5 in my book!"
3,Not all it is cracked up to be.,"I have had this camera for about 6 weeks now and all though I am somewhat satisfied, I think that the picture quality could be better for this price and resolution. I also purchased an Olympus D340R for a friend, and although it is only 1.3 Megapixels, the color is much better, the pictures blow up almost as well, despite the lower res., and the LCD display is sharper and easier to view in daylight. Considering the huge difference in price, the Olympus is a bargain. Of course it does not zoom, but you can hardly call the 60mm of the Kodak a real zoom. Having used zoom lenses on 35mm SLRs for years I can testify that the 30 to 60 zoom is more like medium wide angle to normal view, rather than true zoom. You will have to buy an accessory 2X lens and adapter to get true + zoom. If you want a less expensive, good performing, zoom camera, check out the Olympus D450 Zoom."
4,Nice!,I loved the product. Great quality and everything. The movie had the original cover and everything. I really appreciated it
5,awesome,I watched this movie when I was a child and now my nephew can watch it. Great classic movie. He loves it.
5,This movie is the best ever.,"The Sandlot is hilarious. Mike Vitar is the star and is brilliant. ""Squints"" is irresistable. The best part is when he pretends to drown and smooches Wendy Peffercorn. This movie is great. I own it and watch it at least twice a week, I don't even like baseball! ""Yeah-yeah"" is adorable. This movie is #1!!"
5,this is the best movie that ever!!!,"I think this movie was the best in the world!!! All the boys (Timmy, Tommy, Squints, Scotty, Benny, Denunez, Bertrum, Ham, and I save the best for last...YEAH YEAH!!!) were absolutely great actors in this movie. My favorite scene in this movie is, when they are at the amusement park, and when squints tries to make out with the life guard (Wendy Peffercorn, who ends up marrying Squints) As you can tell my favorite character in this movie is Yeah Yeah. I think he is soooo cute!!! (Marty York in real life) Overall, i think this movie was very well layed out, and that you should buy it. Its worth every penny. I cannot say enough about this movie!-->BUY THIS MOVIE!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!<--"
1,Bad DVD,The DVD was bad it won't play. It won't play. It won't play. It won't play. It won't play. It won't play.
2,Stand By Me?,"I can understand why this is a likable film, but did anyone draw parallels to Rob Reiner's far superior ""Stand By Me"" from 1986?"
2,Good Baseball Humor,"This movie is okay, but kind of gets boring after a while. It's about a bunch of kids who like playing baseball, and they make fun of the new kid dork. But later they give him a chance, and become his friend. The acting is good and there are a lot of funny scenes. The ending is the best part to watch, because the kids are struggling to help the new kid get back a valuable baseball.This movie is worth renting for any baseball fan. It's also very funny too."
1,Disappointed,This movie was recommended to me but I was disappointed. Any uplifting message gets lost in a pointless plot. The movie is mostly a bunch of kids using foul and vulgar language. I would not let my children watch it. Why is it so hard to make a decent movie?
2,not for children,"There is a lot of cussing in this film.If you want your children to start using the ""F"" word, and chewing tobacco, then this movie is for you. The primary messages in this movie seem to be that chewing tobacco is cool, and that it is perfectly normal for children to be using the ""F"" word.The only thing that this movie gets right is the part about Babe Ruth appearing in dreams to help people solve their problems."
2,GARBAGE!,"This movie is junk! I watched this at school when it was raining one day when our team wasn't able to go on a field trip because it was raining. At first I liked it but then, the next day I started thinking about that Old Man Merkel story from the 1940s and when the gang chewed tobacco at the carnival and threw up while they were on that spinning ride. That part was scary and got stuck in my head certain nights and I was sometimes afraid to fall asleep. And now, sometimes when I enter the computer room, I remember the movie or when I hear the song Brother Louie-Stories which is a good song but that song reminds me of this movie. The 1997 movie ""Leave it to Beaver"" is 10x better than this movie. The only part I like in this movie is the ending."
5,Sandlot,"I think this is the best baseball movie ever made. It deals with a group of kids who play baseball non-stop. Its their life, and nothing can stop them. A new kid moves into town, and benny decides to let him into the group. Hes nothing like them but works his way up there, and his nickname is ""smalls"". One day they were playing a pick-up game and hit a ball over the fense. It was their only ball and it was still early. They had nothing to do, so ""smalls"" decides to get his step dads autographed baseball by the 80's yankees. He brings it out to play, and he's up to bat. He hits a homerun, but its a huge problem. The rest of their summer, they try and get out the ball from the backyard with the dog knows as the "" beast "" in there."
4,Sandlot,"What i like about the movie Sandlot was it always kept u on your guessing. There is this kid named Smalls. One day while they were playing baseball another kid hit a homerun. So smalls runs back and gets a ball which is signed by Babe Ruth, which he didn't know who was famous. As he gets to bat he knocks a homerun into the lot where the beast is who is mean dog. So now he has to get the baseball before he gets in big trouble. You have to watch the movie to see what happens."
2,Poor Quality,"The dvd came in a timely manner, but was scratched and some parts of the movie were un-watchable. I was less than pleased with this product, especially as it was oringally listed as 'very good' quality."
5,This is a movie for all ages. My family loved it.,This is a movie that can and has been watched time and time again. My oldest daughter who is now 17 has watched this movie so many times that she could say word for word all the lines that were spoken. My all time favorite part of the movie is the pool scene. I would love to know is there is a soundtrack to this movie or clothing with the Sandlot gang featured.
4,Wonderful family film,"The Sandlot (1993) Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, James Earl jones, Karen AllenRated PG.Tagline: They're more than a team. They're the best buddies in the entire history of the world.It's rare to find a family movie about the innocence of childhood. This film takes place in the summer of 1962. A new kid on the block encounters local kids playing a baseball game of sorts in a dusty sandlot and he wants to fit it but doesn't know how to go about it.Not much plot to speak of as this film is about kids being kids, in a time gone by. A time when a boy's mind was occupied by thoughts of fresh, cool lemonade and being able to catch pop flies and rocketing infield grounders, and learning to make friends, and even noticing girls.Summer plus baseball equals adventure. And friendship.All summers should be like this.This film is an undiscovered classic. Well worth owning a copy."
5,Son had to have for christmas,Came quick even before it was supposed to! Love it! Great Christmas item. Wll be ordering from here again. Thanks!
5,"My 3 year old thinks this movie is ""the best ever"".","This movie is great for kids of all ages. My 3 year old canrecite the lines. Everyday, we play baseball and he pretends to be the players. He pretends there is a beast behind the fence. His imagination runs wild and at the same time, he has improved his baseball skills! What fun it is to watch him get so into the movie and the characters. He even eats better b/c he pretends all his food is a smore. He loves this movie!!!!! And his dad thinks it is great too!!"
3,YOU PLAY BASEBALL LIKE A GIRL!...,One of the best movies ever made. Just a blast to watch and enjoy. My friends and I have soooo many memories that this movies reminds us of. I believe anybody who watches this movie can connect with it on some level. You just have to love the American Past Time.
4,for once a good family film,"this was a movie which I found surprisingly funny and warm. It should be mandatory for every kid who loved baseball to see it. It has some great moments which I will never forget like the dog, james earl jones (he was really good), the pool w/ the lifegaurd (really funny), the smores and the ending chase. Just writing this makes me want to watch it again. Just one question, how could the kid not know that the great bambino was babe ruth?"
4,Just to clarify...,"Just to clarify from all of the other reviews, the dog in this video is a Mastiff not a St Bernard! The movie is worth a view just to see this amazing breed, a true gentle giant in action!"
4,Pretty Good!,I Saw Haf Of This Video And It Was Pretty Good. It Has My Girlfriends Favorite Sport. You Minte Like This Movie If You Like Movies Such As The Big Green And Space Jam!
3,The Sand lot.,"This was a requested gift for someone. I have no idea if he loved it, but I'm sure he did, he requested it."
4,Your killing me Smalls,"The Sandlot makes you want to be a kid again, it show's you how big your imagination can go , As Scotty Smalls gets he and his new found friends in the biggest pickle of all.Scotty take's his step-father's (Dennis Leary)baseball singed by Babe Ruth having no idea who the Babe is .So he and his friends can play ball, Smalls hits his first homer and heads towards centrefeild after the ball where there a wait's The Beast.So watch Smalls and the gang try to get the souvenir back .Batter up and Enjoy"
5,It Rocks!,This was my favorite movie growing up. I was soo happy to see Amazon selling it for such a reasonable price.
4,"Great coming of age tale similar to television's ""Wonder Years""","This is the tale of a magical summer and boys growing up to form fast friendships--and a team. Baseball's the binder here, but it could be any activity. The characters are engaging and the cameo by James Earl Jones is not to be missed."
5,"Fun movie, I like it a lot","Very good movie, it is fun to watch with the kids, they love it. I highly recommend it for the family"
5,Benny was my first love,"I got this movie for a friend in England who has never played baseball and never had a s'more! Part of the American experience, the Sandlot is a nostalgic classic - one to be shared with our children and theirs."
5,the sandlot,"This movie remind me my chilhood,my very old pals,is a great movie for everyone,is a great movie for the family.When you have friends like this,you understands the meanings of friendship."
5,one of the greatest movies,i first saw the sandlot back in 1993 and after that i watched it everyday. it was my fave movie back then and is still one of the movies i could watch anytime. i love it.
2,Boring,"I found this book boring. There was no plot, just page after page of sex, that to me, wasn't even erotic. Don't get me wrong, I love really great erotic sex scenes, but this book left me bored. I felt no connection to any of the characters in this book. It's going in the trash."
4,Tongue in Cheek,"I just finished reading Tabitha Flyte's Tongue in Cheek and thought it was not just the usual erotic senseless dribble but an unusually intelligent story of a young woman exploring herself. Tongue in Cheek will take you on an interesting journey through one woman's relationships with a stable, sensible man to a young high school student.I think readers will get a two in one speacial here. There are plenty of love scenes that will make you cross your legs and blush plus an enthralling story that will stop you from skipping pages to get to the loving.I hope I hear more from this author."
4,Once you start you can't put it down,This is the first erotica book I've read and I could not put it down after page one. I could not help but be happy that the lead character found who she was and what she could give to others
1,Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse and Friends Vol. 5,"I Love This Video. They Got my Favorites. Cartoons Includes: ""The Opry House"", ""Donald's Ostrich"", ""Mickey's Delayed Date"", and ""Cured Duck"""
1,Very Disapointed!,"We got this phone a couple of months ago and are still not able to use it at all. Originally, we could not hear anything from this phone at all. Now only faint voice can be heard, but the only end still has no sound at all.I spend hours reading the manual, but still can not make it work for us. Maybe it is a malfunctioning one. I would definitly NOT buy any Uniden products in the future."
5,Great Cordless with great features,This is a really good phone! Love the size and the handsfree features on each phone AND the base. Our last phone did not have that feature on the base and if the phone rang and we could not locate the handsets we could not answer the phone. Now we can! The reception is great and the volume features are easy to operate. We also got a killer price and prompt delivery. We are happy customers!
5,GREAT phone!,"For anyone having trouble with any Uniden Cordless phones with Bellsouth DSL service, we had the same issue initially. We went to Home Depot and they have a little gadget for $25 that you put on your phone line where it comes in your home, that separates the line into one going to DSL and the other going to the phone line and filters them separately. We went around and around with this issue until we bought this gadget and put it on our phone line. We have not had ONE problem since, and we were getting 20+ disconnects from DSL a day beforehand. The phones are GREAT. The problem is the Bellsouth DSL filters they supply and the way they are used, is not very effective. Save any frustrations, keep the phone, and just go buy the $25 gadget for the phone line!"
3,Nice phone but sound problem!,"While talking, my callers do not hear me clearly. Sometimes, I can hear my own voice coming back!"
4,Good deal!,We are very satisfied (if not blown away) by this phone. For the price it has some very nice features. We especially like that we can access messages from any phone(we also purchased extra handset to go with this system)and we really like the speaker phone feature on each handset. The handsets are a little small but that's not all bad. Sound is a little tunnel-like but not a deal breaker for us. Paid less for this system plus an extra handset than we could find in any other brand that had same features.
3,"Okay, but could've been a lot better","I bought this book five years ago, since it sounds like a really interesting idea and has neat cover art. I read about 20 pages, and put it down due to lack of interest. I recently picked it up again and finished it, but found myself pushing through most of it. It gets a little better than the prologue, but I just didn't care too much about the people of Oldorando (or even keep them straight, since their names all sound the same). A few chapters could've adequately told the story that takes several hundred here. It would be nice to know more about the Earth Station that's observing the planet, since they seemed a lot more interesting than any of the inhabitants of Helliconia. I'm all for blending genres, but this particular blend (almost Conan-style fantasy mixed with splashes of hard sci-fi), just doesn't work very well. It will be a long time, if ever, before I pick up the second volume."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Helliconia Spring is the start of a big fat series from way back then.The title comes from the planet it is set on. For astronomical reasons it is one of those places that has really, really long seasons. Now, when it is winter, this really sucks donkey gonads, of course.So, the setting for the first book is coming out of winter into a more pleasant time, and the interaction between two major races on the planet, one humanoid, one not."
1,No plot,"Of course, this is not Dune. It's a series of episodes loosely bound together, with uninteresting humanoids going to and from nowhere and a cameo human observation space station. It makes one think when the most memorable character in the book is the revenge - seeking phagor. A classic? Classic books have plots."
2,Inflicted on me by a book group,Obviously the trilogy should have been one book. I am glad I only had to read the first part of the three.
2,Don't bother with this game,"If you remember the original Populous for PC's, then don't bother with this game. It's nothing like the Original, and you will be disappointed. The graphics on this are primative, game control sux, and the game just isn't that fun to play."
5,Populous the begining,"I loved this game for the playstation especially with the cheats. i will tell you one. in the first level click on all the trees, you will get all buildings and all spells but first go to the start menu and you will see a cheat menu.if you dont want to wait for your spells to charge up go to the cheat menu again.that will make the game brillant."
1,Avoid. Possibly fake or pirated copies.,These are not actually printed dvd's. All covers are inkjet printed (with perforated edges) and paper sticker dvd faces. They look exactly like pirated unofficial copies. The movies are copied on purple DVD-R's. I will be asking for a refund immediately.
3,For Collectors Only,"This is a rare piece of footage, lasting only about eight minutes and showing Mable Normand in the earliest part of her career. I find it amusing and historically interesting -- especially to see the 1913 state of the art in car racing --, but this sort of thing is obviously not for everyone. The filming technique is so primitive that Ms. Nomand's comedic style is hardly highlighted. The film quality is not too bad considering that this is such a very old piece of stock."
2,ANOTHER GREAT RESOURCE ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S FOR CHILDREN,"Contrary to popular belief, Ms. Shriver's book wasn't actually the first book that was geared toward children in an attempt to help them have a better understanding about Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Ann Frantti wrote a book entitled ""Grandma's Cobwebs"" several years ago on this same topic. Not only does her book explain the workings of this dreadful disease, it also has a supplementary booklet that has FAQs to help parents with any questions their children may have.Unfortunately, Dr. Frantti doesn't have the benefit of Ms. Shriver's ""star power"" in terms of getting publicity about ""Grandma's Cobwebs,"" but her book is excellent."
3,What happens to Grandpa,"It is a great book for the whole family. It tells how a family deals with there Grand father who has alztimers. The girl named Kate who helps her Grand father remember things by a photo albume, the way she helps is write the stories that went with the pictures. I would give it three stars because it is not really a kids book it is more a family kind of book. But it is still a great book. And the pictures are great they are watercolors."
5,Excellent book for kids,"I wanted some sort of book or story that would help my two grandsons understand why ""granpa"" was so angry sometimes. This book really helped explain the condition, but did not go into the anger issue. But it was a great help for them."
3,"Comfy sheets, but overpriced","These sheets are much paler than they appeared in the pictures (The fitted sheet doesn't even have hint of pink to it), and they're on the small size (they barely fit on my Queen mattress with foam pad)That said though, after a couple washings, they've become very comfortable, and are delightful to sleep on. I'm not sure if they were worth the price though."
1,$65 to Rent?,"Who is going to pay $65 to see this? If Amazon brings the price down to something affordable, say even $5, I would rent it and write a review about it."
3,"Calder's Grammar - worth having, but not for beginners","Calder's grammar is well worth having for the advanced student of the language; It has a great deal of useful information that is not easily found in other sources. It is, however, rather difficult to read for both typographical and organizational reasons. The coverage of grammatical structure is very detailed, and has many examples. Calder assumes that the reader already has a fairly good knowledge of the language; A beginner would find this book extremely difficult to use. The grammar books by Michel Byrne would be a better choice for a beginner."
5,True love story,"Frank and Barb Peretti are an inspiration and blessing to anyone who meets them. Their life and marriage, as told through this wonderful book, should be in the hands of every couple starting out their lives together. I know I have come to know the Lord through them, and have been inspired in every part of my life through this experience. Not every book can change your life. I pray this one will. I know that the chance to do the art work for Barb's writing, working with my husband and fine artist, Rick, has changed my life. Frank and Barb, I love you guys! -Carrie"
2,a white washed story,Everyone thinks their own black is the blackest. Peretti is no exception. While they did go through lean times both physically and spritiually this story in no way compares to other Christian people who triumphied over tragedy. Possibly there is an untold story here that would explain the unlying tone of anger. All in all the basic teaching of realiance on God is neutralized by a pity story.
4,Super Reader,"Corum has gained himself a new moniker in this book, The Prince of the Silver Hand, thanks to a bit of an accident with one of his arms that required some mystical aid to restore an arm to usefulness.He is moving up the ladder, and has to take on the Queen this time, to try and protect his own plane. The ever faithful Companion to Champions is with him, pet included."
4,Rober Kennedy Shadow play the murder of Robert F.Kennedy,"Very intense and very strange happenings,I remember the whole thing,it wasa horrible crime,but Ithink it was a conspericy.All the way,and i do not thinkhe acted alone."
1,Desire Bound,This is the worst book I have ever read by Thea Devine. It is so boring and convoluted I couldn't even finish it. I have tried twice. I agree with another reader it is so fast paced you never know where you are. Also the characters are weak and the sex scenes are poorly done.
2,The sex was great but the plot and story line very weak.,"By Desire Bound left me feeling lost and not knowing in which direction to go. The plot was weak and confusing. I have read other books by Ms.Devine and was spellbound by her natural ability to tell a story(a very steamy story). To say that I was disappointed is hard for me because I love to read paranormal romances, but while reading this one I could not suspend my disbelief."
1,"Steamy as always, but what happened to the plot?","Thea Devine used to write sexy psychologically interesting novels that introduced some unusual characters with fantastical plots and settings. Although I certainly believe in willing suspension of disbelief Ms. Devine has gone too far and provided too little plot to back up her wild wanderings. Pengellis is found naked in a brothel with no sight and no memory. He regains and loses his sight for seemingly arbitrary and ill explained reasons. Darcie strikes me as a poorly formed character. Her relationship with her husband is bizarre and only barely alluded to. The elements of fantasy and horror that permeate this story are not what turn me off. She has successfully used them in other books, but not this one! They are wildly overblown here."
2,"Sexy, but vague & confusing plot.","This was the first book I've read by Ms. Devine. I was intrigued by it although you definitely have to suspend belief and be able to constantly switch your train of thought to keep up. I plan to read others by her to compare. I enjoyed the erotic portion, felt it was originally done in parts although excessive to the point of ridiculous in places. I felt like telling the herione to ""take a (real) bath already"". The supernatural element quality was mixed and confusing although promising in sections."
3,"This book is okay, but less for love and more for sex!!!","While I understand that the book sould have some parts with sex this book was full of it. At times when I thought that the book was getting very good, She would throw in more sex and take away what ever surprise I was expecting and therefore kill it for me."
4,An excellent reference,"This primer is the best starting point for anyone interested in getting a quick yet broad picture of cognitive aging. It seems to have been written with the academic reader in mind, but is accessible enough for a popular press audience (especially the first section Basic Mecanisms).I'd love to see a second edition of this book. A great amount of progress has been made especially in section 4 of this book, Applications, over the past 5 years. A new chapter on decision making by Mara Mather or Melissa Finucane and a chapter about technology by Art Fisk/Wendy Rogers/Neil Charness/Sara Czaja/Joseph Sharit would make for a great second edition."
5,The best thing ever,"Im from England UK and these DVDs from this company are so great I have to import them! In the UK we have some Mario DVDs but they are not a collection, just random episodes and then they stop making them. Im thankful for NTSC TVs and multi-region DVD players. Its a shame there not avaliable in other regions cause I think they would sell like hotcakes. I remember this show in the UK on channel 4 on Saturday morning. I used to wake up to late and miss it at times."
5,Good,"Gave this to my son for christmas he has really enjoyed watching this series from his younger days, he plays all the games also."
4,Engineering for laymen,"This book is written by a multitude of authors, all engineers, but the intended audience is the average person. No equations appear, for instance. It brings together in one place material previously available seperately, and probably intended for service managers and technicians.It's easy to read, although, being a reference book, translated from German into English no less, the writing is strictly utilitarian.The book design is excellent, with plenty of illustrations, and the content is very up-to-date, covering gasoline direct injection and individual coils, for example. Very in-depth coverage overall."
3,OK Lancome for Men,I brought this hoping this would have a scent close to the original Lancome that was discontinued. But alas this is quite a bit sweeter not at all like the original Lancome for Men. Still a good cologne if you girl likes that scent.
1,Billiards: the official rules and records bk.--bca,What's the point in selling an outdated copy? I'm looking for the latest version 2000 or 2001. So many rules have changed since 1998 that the copy your selling is almost useless to those of us that are billiard buffs and take the game seriously.
2,This issue is badly out of date. Useless at this price.,"The current issue was released in late 1998 and it includes many rules changes from the offered issue. At the right price, it would be useful for those wanting an excellent recent history of the games played."
5,I really wish more people would read this.,"Every bar, tavern, club and hall with a pool table (in the US) should have a copy of this on-hand. The horrendous inconsistence and outright ridiculousness of most local and house ""rules"", not to mention individual ""rules"", has made a sorry mess of recreational American pocket billiards. I can only hope that the REAL games of 8-ball, 9-ball, etc., become better known to amateur players over time, and that the bogus, corrupt, yokel variants of these games finally die off some day."
4,"Still have to read this, but looks well written",Have been wanting to brush up on my Billiards Rules. This looks like to book that will answer any question pertaining to billiards. 2013 will be the year to pick this one up.
4,One of the best games,"I rented this game and it is so cool.it has a whole lota characters from other videogames.I rented this game only because i saw cloud from ff7 on it ^-^ It has a rpg and mini games and fighting modes.The fighting thing is so good.i used the battle stages to cheat.since i could move in the back and foreground, i used to run around the opponent then kick them and run! but the rpg is boring. it gets nowhere fast. but over all it is still a good game"
5,WHAT A GAME!,"This was a Squaresoft masterpeice! It sort of reminds me of Super Smash Bros. because it has characters from some Squaresoft games. If you've never played it, you should!"
5,Awe inspiring,"I don't own this game, but I can tell by what people have said and by the pictures, that this game can't go unnoticed. I know people have sound it's easy, but it will be interesting, especially if it includes powerful people from Final Fantasy VII.I know this game won't screw up your hopes for good games, so you should try it sometime in you life time. If you don't, and you like it, you won't be able to experience a very great game."
3,FFVII carried an average game over the top,"I owned (past tense because i lost it) this game when it first came out because i was able to control FFVII characters in a different atmosphere. Now with the release of Crisis Core i purchased the game again to re-live that feeling. And once again i had a lot of fun fighting Sepheroth vs Zack, and other various combinations. But i realized that if FF characters were not an option, i wouldn't think twice about this game. I was also a little dissapointed at Cloud's face, it didn't look the same as it does in FFVII. Some of their second costumes are so stupid, with the exception of Vincent. But Tifa & Cloud's 3rd costume are great.Overall the game is fun, but only because of the FFVII characters. Without them, i would find this game in the $3 bin."
5,Best Game! Go Squaresoft!,"This game was so good! I love Squaresoft so much! All their games ROCK! This game, though different from all the others still ROCKED!"
3,Ouch! What happend?,"Squaresoft is my most favorate company ever. however, they have moved more and more out of the RPG market. Some of these games are great (Final Fantstasy Tactics). But this game is on par with FF mystic quest (those who have played that game know what I mean) . The game did have a good start but after an hour I was done with it. And the other ""RPG"" part of it was just plain sad. It had no plotwist or even a plot. all you do is go back and forth. And when finnaly beat it, you get no end. Just a job well done . but I do admit it did have some good mini games.But,if you want to play this game , just rent it!"
3,"Too short , well at least they added extras",This game is tooo easy and short I beat it in 5 minutes simutultaneosly . If your a final Fantasy Fan get this game but if your not Rent it becuase Its toooooo easy and the extras are well.... lets just say not very complicated and theres an RPG its ok but RENT IT INSTAED!!
5,Experiencing divinity,"This CD has become part of my lifestyle. I have derived tremendous benefits by listening to it since 2003. To me, it's all about belief and faith. Not necessarily in a religion per se but in experiencing divinity through the soul of healing meditations.Thank you Mr Chopra for this creation !"
2,Could be better,"I bought this to assist my recovery from a long bout with Lyme disease. I found it minimally useful. It is relaxing, but I was hoping some more creative visualizations directed toward healing one's body. Perhaps it is intended to heal the soul, which may ultimately heal the body, but I was disappointed."
2,Too weird for me,"Although I feel it's not ""pc"" to say, I was distracted by Dr. Chopra's strong accent. I found the hindu god calling a bit ""out there"" for my mind set. I will listen a few more times before passing final judgement (and maybe passing on the CD)."
2,Stan's Review:,"I enjoyed the first part of this CD but it left me flat when it went into Hindu gods. Don't get me wrong--if you can believe that wtuff feel free but as a Christian I don't plan to flirt with breaking the first commandant. I thought the CD would be more in line with Buddhism. Buddha, as I understand it, did not believe in God, per se, but he was a very admirable person and did a lot of good for the human race. I am also a great admirer of the Dalai Lama. I did give this CD to a nurse who is a Buddhist and she enjoyed it. I also like Deepak Chopra and wouldn't I love to have his money."
2,poor quality,I ordered this product before and it was great. But the quality of this CD I bought from a vendor was poor. It was from a library and the cover looks so dirty and old.
1,the soul of healing meditations,"This book or Cd was given to the Good will because I found it Not useful. I will never reccommend it to anyone, I am very disappointed since Chopra is one of my favorite authors.....pat"
3,calming,"This is great for calming oneself and slowing your breath. I have not been able to take any inner journeys of self discovery while listening to it, however, which is something I have been able to do with other guided visualizations."
4,Great for those who like guided meditations,"When I feel like being guided through a meditation I often take out this one. It brings me quickly into my heart, into an appreciative state where I feel very connected."
4,Good Work Stress Relief,"I listen to this on my way to work and my way home if things are tense at work. However, as a Christian I find a couple tracks hard to handle as they ask for assistance from various dieties. I silently change the names to fit who I ask for assistance. His voice is very pleasant. As a beginnner, this helps me."
3,Calming but sharp intonations,"These are good, but of you want to listen to Isobel Aura's 22 meditations covering everything from Heavenly Relaxation to Death of a Loved One Meditation with beautiful healing music and a soothing british voice it is far superior to this and you are also left feeling healed, empowered and in control of your life. I would highly recommend Isobel Aura's Meditations."
2,Not to my taste,"I bought this to help me through recovery from open heart surgery. It may have worked but I really didn't like the style of it at all, though I did use it consistently for a while."
4,ok cd,"This cd is okay. Nothing great about it, just does what it says. I was prepared to be ""wowed"" and was letdown. Given the choice I would not buy again. CD is for beginners only."
5,My First and Only Digital Camera...,"Although I have only a friend's Olympus 2500L to compare to, and although I've never used any other digital camera before, after lots of research I bought the DC290 for my husband's artwork. I love it. Great quality. I didn't use the 16MB card it came with yet; I needed more space so I bought a 64MB card with the camera. Fantastic images with the 'High' setting. Battery eater, but aren't they all? Very easy to use, if you're new at it. I really like the Review/Magnify mode. I haven't even touched the surface regarding features. I'm searching for better photo-editing software though...I'm not impressed with the Adobe bundle, but it's free so worth a try. The viewfinder is a little oddly placed, but easy to adapt to. I definitely recommend the camera."
3,Good camera,"It's an extremely good machine, a little heavy and batery doesn't last much, but it's a good product."
3,"used, look ugly, but working","It is a replacement for a ancient Kodak gel imaging system. It looks that it has been through a lot, but works just fine. Price was a bit high considering the age, feature and the condition of the thing."
3,That 100 page user Manual????,"Great camera comes with the worst user manual I've ever seen (except for the one Apple includes with it's iMac ( there is none...really). After a couple of months, I am still trying to figure out how to download shots that include thumbnails with the photo numbers to my iMac HD. It does not seem to have the ability to upload digital pictures to Photoworks in Seattle for storage and custom prints.For the price, it should whistle a tune for you while your reading the user manual. When you want to look something up, you get only half the information and are told to turn to 2 or 3 other pages for information, rather than just telling you the whole story in one place."
3,I agree with Joe Pool,"I bought this camera for $300 and have always been happy with it. Takes great pictures, does have some delay, and is a little heavy. I also got the E 11 Error message but I don't have the manual anymore. Now I'm on the hunt to find someone to fix this... If I find anyone, I'll let you all know.*** Update:The E 11 error message was from corruption of the media card, most likely from taking too many pictures too fast, or from not giving the camera time enough to write data to the card before I turned it off. Even after reformatting the card it was useless and I had to throw it away. Shame, but the camera still takes great pics, just give it a little time to shoot, and don't take pictures on low batteries. Could ruin the card."
4,Good account of live U2,"I became a devout U2 fan after watching their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Bono genuinely captivated the crowd in a way only great entertainers can, Edge's guitar rang out in sharp, crisp notes, and the rhythm section of Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton kept everything in tow. This album goes a long way towards capturing what early U2 sounded like live. The band is full of energy and fire; these fellas had something to prove and did so with zest. ""Gloria"" and ""The Electric Co."" crackle with intensity, ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" is urgent, and ""40"" (based on Psalm 40) is more alive than on the studio version from War. This album is packed full of exuberance that makes the best live rock and roll a truly transcendent experience."
4,Good Live Document of the Early Years,Under a Blood Red Sky is undeniably exciting to listen to. I still remember how great all that Red Rocks footage used to look in the days when MTV still showed videos. U2 was definitely more thrilling live before Bono discovered the glamour of the rock star life. This is a must have if you are a fan of U2's original three albums. What would make it a must have for any fan is if the powers that be saw fit to combine it with Wide Awake in America (an equally short live mini-disc) and gave everyone a little value for their money.
4,"great encapsulation of U2, part I","This record is a snapshot of a band that was still young enough to create music as pure energy and experienced enough to execute it well. Most noteworthy on this 8-song recording are the pounding opener, ""Gloria,"" an unapologeticly scortching version of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", and two superior tracks not found on their previous studio albums, ""11 O'Clock Tick Tock"" and ""Party Girl"".HINT: And if you cannot get enough of U2 live circa 1983, check out the recent ""Sweetest Thing"" single which has live versions of ""Twilight"" and ""An Cat Dubh"" from the same Red Rocks performances of 1983."
2,Don't fall for the con - The CD sells you short.,"It's well sad to see that the producers of the CD format took it upon themselves (due to space limitations no doubt) to exclude a key part of the performance on Electric Co. Those of you who experienced the vinyl or taped format will not fall for the spicing technique used to cut out the 'la, la, la la in America.......' mid-piece. WHY WASN'T THIS DECLARED?! You just can't play around with an artiste's piece of work like this; not less the greatest Rock God's who ever walked on God's Earth (sort of;..if you get my drift et al).Therefore, I hereby announce the start of the campaign to consign the CD to the bin; let's have The Real Deal - The Full Length version. Polygram please take note!!!KOC England (See my review of the Video)"
5,Excellent,U2 is one of the best live groups. but the album is only 35 minutes long. if it only was a bit longer.
3,Good but far from complete.,"I am disappointed that after all this remastering they couldn't at least give us the entire live show for ""Under a Blood Red Sky"". Are we to believe that U2 only performed 8 songs at Red Rocks? Come on, give us the audio of the full show.Now, remaster ""Unforgettable Fire"" for a two-disc set, please!"
4,minor point,"Just a picky little point; Colorado State U is not in Boulder, CO as listed several times in the booklet. It is in Ft. Collins."
3,FAIR,"This, like all U2 albums, is a must-have. However, like Rattle and Hum, it fails to live-up to expectations. The best thing about this album is that it includes the ""live"" versions of Sunday Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day, Gloria, and ""40"". I don't know what could have made this album better, it just doesn't have the ""energy"" and ""drive"" that the others have."
3,Are they opening or headlining?,"3 1/2Brief but blistering early live documentation of the group who, back in their earnest heyday, made terms like ""arena-rock"" seem powerful, UABLS might not have been the landmark early live disc fans were hoping for, but still offered ample reason why this sound should be documented (particularly that of Edge's fascinating textures). If they would have put a little more variety into their classic renditions and added a few more choice live cuts the disc could have been necessary (something they are apparently trying to remedy with the upcoming remastered double disc)."
5,Big Dan says,"I just think this was as real as a band can come accross, Perfect setting and the sound made the words even better"
4,Good Overview of the Early Days,"U2 is at their best live, and they've tried to catch that strength at various times on recording, with limited success each time. Remember ""Rattle and Hum,"" the motion picture? Good for what it was, but a bit over ambitious, even for U2. ""Under a Blood Red Sky"" is the first attempt (I'm pretty sure) to put their live stuff onto a recorded medium, and they do a pretty good job, I must say. Everybody knows the anthems ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" and ""New Years Day,"" probably ""Gloria"" and ""I Will Follow"" as well, and those tracks come out great. But it's the lesser known tunes that really get pulled out in this one, ""the Electric Co."" sounds awesome and of course, ""40"" is anthemic live. If you're new to U2, this album probably isn't for you, but if you appreciate their old stuff you'll love this one for sure."
3,More than meets the ears,"This CD is Lousy, if you know the full story. I purchased this CD and thought it was the best concert of the century, then the internet came along, and I downloaded the FULL concert and guess what, I now have TWO full CD's of over 90 minutes of music from this spectacular concert. Even the VHS of the show does not include all of the songs from this concert. Most annoying is the song sequence of UABRS CD. Gloria which opens this CD is actually played fourteenth into the set. 11 o'clock is played 16th, I will Follow is seventeenth. I think you see my view. Anyway, search around the internet and you'll be amazed at how easy it is to find this great, unreleased (why) concert. Then you will see my point of view."
1,u2 used to be a great band,"When the original EP Under a Blood Red Sky came out in 1983, it included a brief snippet of ""Send in the Clowns"" in the song ""The Electric Co"". When the CD was released about 10 years later, ""The Electric Co"" included one of the most awkward edits I've ever heard in order to omit that brief snippet of ""Send in the clowns"". Ever since then, I've hoped the original version would be restored. This is not the case with this release. Rather than restore the orginal EP version of ""The Electric Co', they've cut another 20 seconds out of the CD version. It sounds better than the previous version but is still not complete. If you want to hear this release in its entirety, you still need to find the EP from 1983, pitiful as that is."
4,Excellent!,"U2 was so much better at the beginning of their career. This is a classic album of some of their best work, live. What could be better?"
5,Great EP and Great Concert,"A couple of the songs from the EP were recorded at Red Rocks, but the majority were recorded at the Lorelei in St. Goarshausen, Germany, an an outdoor amphi-theatre situated along the Rhine River. I was stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army then and was lucky enough to attend that concert. Several bands performed that day: Steve Miller, Joe Cocker, U2, The Stray Cats. U2 stole the show that day (Joe Cocker was a close second). From the moment they entered the stage, Bono and the band had the crowd in the palm of their hands. The most memorable moment was during the final encore song, ""40"", when those of us in the crowd continued to sing the refrain ""How long to sing this song?"" for several minutes after the band had finally left the stage. Of all the concerts I've attend over the past 30 plus years, this one stands out as one of the greatest. If you want to get a taste of this great band performing live in their early days, you owe it to yourself to buy this EP."
3,U2 cut short,"I saw U2 on this tour, the famous War tour and the cd album does not do it justice. It is tame and lame. And if you've seen the vhs/dvd show from Red Rocks, you know what I'm talking about. There are only a handful of songs on the cd and they are not even from one show, much less from Red Rocks. Producers of this one were too conservative.I wish the band would release a cd of the Red Rocks show rather than this rehash. Good cd bootlegs are out there and back up what I'm trying to say.And I can't help remembering the simplicity, the honesty, the intimacy of the War tour when I see the circus the band now puts on. Last two tours seemed forced and Hollywood. Check out the Red Rocks show here and you will see why we fell in love with this band way back when. Bono, get off your soapbox and find your mojo again!"
3,A good look at the first three album,"This album contains the best from U2 from the three first album.The choice of song is quite good and the songs are played with energy by the band. The highlight are ""11 oclock Tick Tock"", ""Sunday bloody Sunday"", ""New year's day"" and ""40"""
1,If not for spliced Electric Co.,I am a fan of U2 and this recording shows them at a pivotal point of their career but I cannot get myself to buy the CD version because a crucial part of Electric Co. is missing. I don't know if this is a global phenomenon or not or this is for copyright West Side Story reasons but can't believe they would cut that part out when it exists on the record. Borrowed this CD from a friend just to listen to that part of the song. If you can get the vinyl version or maybe tape version (not sure if they cut it out from the tape) buy that instead. Other U2 fans know what I'm talking about.
4,This isn't a bad recording!,I like this. It's live so it doesn't have the clean sterility of a studio recording. It captures the early passion of U2's youth quite well. No U2 collection is complete without it!
4,I just love live music,"I only gave this 4 stars because it is a superior album in comparison to most live albums it still inferior to ""Rattle and Hum"" which blows this out of the water..However it is worth the price if you want to hear some good ole pre-zoo tv U2"
4,A U2 Classic,"What could be better than U2 from 1983 in concert? They were at their early peak and touring the U.S. ""Under a Blood Red Sky"" epitomizes that.The CD/DVD version a great buy because you get the best of both worlds.The CD does leave you wanting more songs other than the eight because eight songs don't quite do ""Blood Red Sky"" justice.The booklet with pictures is a great added bonus."
4,My favorite U2 Album,Bono's voice was meant to be heard live. He's a passionate political activist and all of his raw energy clearly comes through in a live format.
4,4 1/2,"This is the U2 that I used to like and even though times change, and bands get older and start experimenting with different material, it doesnt mean they have to write some soft, whimpering album made for Lite-FM radio, like ""How to dismantle an Atomic Band"" Yet, This is one hellva Live album, and it also contains all of U2's best songs from their early era, (expect for one, that why it didnt get 5 stars) There is so much energy in this record, and the songs live, are actually better then the studio versions. If you arent a huge fan of U2, I believe you will like this anyway because it is one of the better Live Rock records. Though short, its sweet, and shouldnt be missed. ENJOY"
3,"Looks good, works, but could be better","Opening up the box and packaging, one is instantly transported to the interior of a Harbor Freight store and the distinctive odor of Made in China. Although the fixture works as advertised, the threads of one of the screw holes that holds down the glass globe striped, with very light torque, when I attempted to reattach the glass, typical of Made in China quality. I was able to insert a small wire into the threaded hole to remedy the defect, but one would expect more. This was a test order to see how the lamp functioned and I have ordered 4 more to complete the project. Not sure what I'll do if more have weak threads."
3,Escali L6000,"I have a smaller/cheaper Escali Primo I'm really happy with, but it was getting old so I decided to buy supposedly better, professional model. More expensive - yes. better? not really. what i hate the most is that this scale needs time to ""think"" before it shows the weight. so if i pour something, i have to do it in intervals. pour a little and wait for the scale, then pour more and wait again. I find it very annoying. but if you need it to weigh items, not liquids, and don't care about the wait, then it is a good scale. The platform is removable, little legs under the scale are adjustable so it can be used on non-horizontal surface. and it looks a bit sturdier then Primo. If it wouldn't be for the delayed response I'd give it 5 stars"
1,This is almost double the price I have seen it sold for on other sites.,"Keep looking I found this at 2,300 on other web sites so if you have to purchase one this is not the place. Keep looking and you will easily find a better price. I agree with rent if you can. These things are so overpriced."
1,made for little kids.,"looks like a wheel chock, no really, ramp its that small.grind rail looks decent. was kinda embarrassed giving it as a gift after they opened it?"
3,"Not bad, but not great.","My son received his ramp quickly which was a good plus. He has been using it for several months. The construction is very durable but he wishes the ramp and rail where a bit higher. This is a good ramp for practice and beginners. Once they get the hang of it, the ramp just doesn't get used much. A good purchase but just wish it was adjustable for skill level."
1,Do Not Purchase.,"This seems like a great gift... WRONG! It is a pain to put together, there was glue all over the place, and it keeps sliding apart. The ramp and rail are two separate pieces, and you can only bolt down the ramp, so every time you go off the ramp, the rail part slides. Very annoying. I bought this for my brother for Christmas and he has yet to be able to use it. We are having to attach the entire thing to some wood, and stake that into the ground. Not a very pleasant experience, and not worth the hassle. But my brother is determined to use it, so we are keeping it."
1,very small,"the only good thing about this item is the rail, the ramp is extremly small and according to the instructions you need to drill this to the ground, when my son try to use the ramp he always feel to the ground because it has no grip"
2,Ehhh,"As a skateboarder, i could see how this would be nice to learn on if you are willing to bolt it in your driveway, but other than that it would be impossible to learn on basically cause it slides all over the place. the kicker is out of discussion because it doesent work, but overall i was not satisfied with this rail. i had it 4 months, and its now broken and in the trash."
2,really bad,"I was very excited to receive this at such a low price. However, I broke my arm really badly the first time I used it. The rail slides around and is way to small. The ramp moves a lot as well. You would have to bolt down both the ramp and rail to avoid any injury. Overall, not a good quality product."
2,Not happy,"My son really wanted the Razor Punk Ramp and Rail combo set, when the package arrive he was so happy. But when we opened we were like what a small thing. I am not satisfied. Sorry, I order it."
3,something missing,"The rail went together easily and the ramp seemed great but when my nephew who is still learning to skateboatd tried to use it,the rail seperated from the ramp and fell. There are screws taped to the bottom of the ramp which appear to be for screwing to concrete but not to the rail which looks like it should have some extentions to attach it to the ramp.because there are holes in both for each."
3,OK,I thought the rail and the ramp where attached. They aren't.Which it will be soon. After i weld an end on the pipe and drill a few holes in the ramp. When my son hits the ramp the rail moves. He's no expert so i can't blame the ramp and rail combo for him falling. but in general it is alot harder to hit a moving target than a stationary one.
3,Buy the rail without the ramp,"The rail is awesome!It is durable, lightweight, and doesn't slide while in use. However, the ramp is a piece of crap. It requires bolting and it slides when approached. It is a waste of money and a hazard to the safety of the user. Buy without the ramp."
4,ramp,The rail is very good. but the ramp isn't that good for begginers. I would suggest getting a less steep ramp to practice on. I only had to bolt the ramp down the rail was fine.
3,works ok,"works just ok. have tried many all natural supplements for my son who tends to get sperts of hyperness on and off throughout the day, despite cutting all the sugar out of his diet. I have also used kids relief calm before and that seems to work better. I will continue to alternate though because I don't like for him to take the same supplement all of the time as it may become ineffective and I am completely against prescription medications for hyper activity. So it does take him down a notch but I will continue to look for alternatives."
2,calming,doesn't work at all but my grand daughter loves the taste says taste like pepsi . but never calmed her down
4,Great product,"This really seems to help my 8 year old calm down in the evenings for bed, especially on days when he has been at school. It seems to help ease any anxiety."
4,Very good but..,"Why the cover songs? They're good but I think one is enough. The new songs sound great though and it's only been a year since their last record.As a long time Fear Factory fan, I'll say this, if they can write songs like Descent and Resurrection from now on, I'll be happy. Those two songs are classic and their coming close esp. with what I've been hearing lately.I see people on here bad mouthing them which is sad. They're better than most of the garbage ""metal core"" that's out now. Arch Enemy? Gimme a break! I liked them when they were called Carcass. These bands are just ripping off the older ones and not even doing a good job of it."
2,hmmm. . . . .,"Fear factory has always been a great band with the exception of a few albums but Transgression is missing everything that Fear Factory is about. A lot of listeners like it simply because it's different . . . while different is normally a good thing, it's not with this one. The music from Obsolete and Archetype was great and couldn't be improved. It came across as energetic with the fast pace beats, this album however is the exact opposite. I have tried listening to this album 3 or 4 times now and it has not had any improvement with me, its just not Fear Factory."
2,Mediocre... -__-,"What the hell happened?.... Only two songs I like off this album. Moment Of Impact, and if you got the cd with the bonus track, Empire.... the rest is .... wtf happened?"
2,Wow!....but a bad...wow,"OK- I have listened to FF for 10 years- maybe more...I love them- I find them original, and they pump me up..what metal should do. This CD is not good- there are no songs that stick out AT ALL!!! I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED! When I read the negative reviews before I got the CD- I thought they were just f'ing around- but listen- this CD is their worst- BY FAR!! AND YES- the DUAL DISC SUCKS. FF- what happened????"
2,Slightly better than Archetype,"The title sums up my opinion. If you're a fan of the ""old"" Fear Factory albums, you will be disappointed. I personally think that it is better than Archetype, but it's still lacking. I would love a return to a sound more like Demanufacture. People leaving these great reviews-have you ever heard some of the older albums? The vocals were my biggest complaint overall. Some slow songs-actually most were slow by past standards. I would not purchase it for more than $6.oo."
1,Fear Factory hit a creative brick wall after their second album,"""Transgression is everything that you would expect from Fear Factory ...unfortunately that's the problem. The first Fear Factory CD I bought was Obsolete. I liked it so much I bought the albums that preceded it and the one after it. I soon realized that they all sounded the same. The reason I think Obsolete was so good was because it had some cash behind the production.Transgression is described as being experimental, but it's evident that the only experiment is to see if they can recreate their sound with less money (almost, but cheap production is noticeable). Fear Factory hit a creative brick wall after their second album, and haven't found a way around it."""
1,Fear Factory Gone Mellow! Worst Fear Factory Album Ever! :(,"I'm a big fan of Fear Factory fan but this is a very disappointed album! Waste my money and my time! Fear Factory, you guys gone mellow wihout Dino Cazares!! I really missed Dino works with his futuristic music like Digimortal & Demanufacture. Please pleaseeee remove those punk music and your fans will be happy!Everybody, if you expect a great modern metal album (and great recording sound album, of course), get ""Arch Enemy - Doomsday Machine"" & ""Children Of Bodom - Are You Dead Yet"" now!!! Forget about this Transgression album..."
3,It has its moments,"After a couple listens, I could bring myself to enjoy about half the songs. These are the things that I think keep this album from greatness.Firstly, the production style is questionable. The recording sounds too normalized and the vocals seem overdone - giving it an artificial, antiseptic quality. But Perhaps this was the intention. I don't doubt that many of these songs sound wonderful on stage - with more subtleties and without all the studio processing.Secondly, its continuity is spoiled by fillers like Echoes of My Scream. I enjoy the first few tracks up until then... Supernova is catchy but a bit cheesy. FF's cover of I Will Follow is good enough - it mostly helps diversify the album.I might recommend Transgression to a listener of numetal, but not to a fan of the FF albums up until Digimortal, like I am. I was fairly impressed by Archetype because it reminded me of Demanufacture. But this one doesn't quite have the teeth, even if it does succeed in breaking some new ground."
4,Fear Factory phaze two marches on...,"yes, there is life beyond Dino Cazares. Fear Factory proved that with their last album, Achetype, their first with Christian playing guitar and new bassist Byron. not only that but it was their first release after their departure from Roadrunner records. after listening to the first track, FF fans will say: ""Dino who?"". however, Transgression is a very slight step down from Archetype. the agression and intensity is a half-notch lower on this album, and I think part of the reason is the production. the sound on Transgression is not as crisp and in-your-face as Archetype. also, on this record Burton has said that their plan was to experiment a little bit with the FF sound to come up with something different to add. the result is a mixed bag. Transgression isn't a bad album (its better than Digimortal), but the power is not on the same level as Archetype."
4,E P,"This cd should have been an EP... the first 4 songs are great..the 2 covers and the track ""echo of my scream"" are worthless. the production is ok, but i liked the sound of Archetype better. They should stop trying so damn hard to sound diversified and realize that Fear Factory fans want a real Fear Factory cd. The other crap are what side projects are for. A little disappointed, but its not nearly as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. Just wish it was an EP, or they waited a little longer and made a full length Fear Factory cd. not add useless tracks that scream of filler material... So 7 of 11 songs are really good. Worth 10 bucks, but not 19...."
1,What happened?????????,"How the hell did Fear Factory made this CD? Especially after making ""Archetype"". This is by far the weakest Fear Factory CD ever recorded. It sounds rush and uninspired. It's garbage. The production on this album sounds so amateurish. The usual kick-ass drumming from Raymond Herrera is not there. Every song on this CD is forgetable. If you do own ""Transgression"" I suggest that u give it away to the salvation army. After I heard ""Trangression"" I popped in ""Archetype"" and ""Demanufacture"" to ease my pain and to erase my memory of a horrendous album such a ""Trangression."""
1,Public Domain at its finest! Buyer Beware.,"The Ballad of Andy Crocker is a descent movie by far, but this DVD is a public domain print--by far the worse print I have ever came across on DVD/VHS."
2,Rip Off,"It's hard to get ripped off on a purchase under $10, but this one did it. the movie was fine but the DVD quality was horrible. At least the original recording was horrible. This movie should never have been distributed on DVD without restoration of the original."
2,Maybe it was just too dated,The movie was just too disjointed. It did not flow at all. Lee Majors was good enough in the role but he wasn't given much to work with. Definite feel of a low budget TV movie.
4,How'd They Pack So Much into a Short Movie??,"This movie may be short, but it has a lot of action packed into it! Beautiful Ann Dvorak plays a discontented wife who leaves her wealthy husband and runs off with a 1930's type sleeze-ball. Her best friends from school, Joan Blondell and Bette Davis comfort her heartbroken husband, played by Warren William, and Joan ends up as wife #2. Bette Davis' talents are completely wasted in this movie, and it's odd to see Warren William in a role where he isn't a seducer or leacherous boss. The story steamrolls to it's conclusion, as Dvorak's son is kidnapped by her lover's gang and the repentant mother must act quickly to save his young life. When this movie ends, somewhat predictably, you kind of breathe out a heavy sigh! It's hard to believe that the whole movie plays out in a little over an hour! THREE ON A MATCH is an enjoyable movie, and a slice of movie nostalgia you can't pass up."
4,"For the money, it's a great deal!!!","It booms, makes a lot of rumbly good sounds, and the controls are very accessible. I have mine hooked into the Yamaha YSP-800 82-Watt Digital Sound Projector. Hooked together the two are a great combo, and the quality is surprisingly good."
2,Highly Overrated,"i first listened to this guy's music in the movie"" Tere Naam"" and i actually liked him back then.it had some great tunes and were real simple.but i dont know wat got into his head.his aashiq banaya apne was a breath of fresh air albeit not that great.but now he's gone overboard.all of his songs on this album are painfully similar and i keep confusing them.the very comparison to justin timberlake in the above review proves how lame he is.he is not a sufi singer,abida praveen,hans raj hans,the great wadalis etc. are.he is just a nasally singer who tries to imitate arabic singers."
4,good show with good music,"I had to play in the orchestra for a run of this show last summer and going into it I had never even heard of Kander and Ebb. However, after listening to this music countless times I began to really dig it. Some of the songs are humorous, but pretty much all of them carry a message. Also the singing on this disc is very well done, personally i'm a fan of the performance of ""Spider Woman"" (I don't know the singer's name). All in all this is a cd worth listening to."
1,Terrible!!!,"I bought 5 cans of this for a project... Horrible!! It's not the paint, it's the sprayer. I sprayed it on the ground to figure out what the heck it was doing and it made two lines... With one spray? Three of the five cans did this. The two that didn't do this had the normal spray top on them. The chalkboard paint by Krylon was perfect and so easy to use. Good product if you get the regular spray button top thing - check before you buy."
4,Metal is forever!!!,This is one scorching album. Primal fear are masters of old school heavy metal and this album proves it. Sure the ballads aren't all that and the very last track is just plain weird but the rest of the album is pure fist pumping metal! The last two PF albums were more modern sounding then their first two albums but having Tom Naumann back in the band seems to have injected more of an old school flavor back into the band and that is fine by me.In my opinion PF can do no wrong. If you like kickin' heavy metal go and get this album.
2,good but not GREAT like Black sun or Nuclear Fire,"Well, I have to say when I put this cd in I was very dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, its a pretty good metal album, but not nearly as strong and powerful as PF's past releases. It starts off with a cheesy Judas preist sound song ""Metal is Forever"", then there are a couple filler tracks that could easily be on a Sinner cd. Towards the middle and the end it gets a lot stronger, but still not quite Primal Fear(in my opinion). Then you get to the last song, track 12. Wait a minute! Where the $#@! is the last song??? Not here! What you get is a couple minutes of narration telling you what happens when you go to hell(which is below the earths crust, by the way!). I would have given this cd 3.5 stars, but that piece of crap at the end made me want to never listen to Primal Fear again."
2,Dissappointment,"I love Black Sun And Nuclear Fire, But This One really sucks!! I sold it to CDWhse The Same Day I Got It!! I Guess All Of The Lineup Changes Took It's Toll. Check Out Tesla's Into The Now For A Quality Album, It Rips!!! Or Go Buy ANY Testament Album For An Ass-Kickin'"
3,devil's ground,"The licks are fantastic, I just wish they could find a drummer with some rhythm, then they would be an excellent band instead of just good."
5,Great Video,Great production - DVDs are of better quality than the previous set my brother had. No problem getting the English dialog to play.
2,Not quite what I thought it was going to be,"Read the description carefully and don't let the picture of this mesh bag fool you. See how the bag in the picture is crammed full of beach stuff? In real life, not so much. The bag is actually quite small -- it holds maybe one beach towel and perhaps some very small beach toys. The handles are sewn on wrong, or something, because you can't get the bag to open wide as shown in the picture. (The handles on both sides are actually attached.) This might be good for laundry or something small -- but for my purposes, it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be."
1,TOO SMALL,"This bag is much smaller than it appears in the picture. It is flat like a pillow case, so keep that in mind when you consider the size. The picture looks like the bag has a bottom but it does not. I feel like an idiot for not reading all of the reviews before purchasing, hopefully you will not make the same mistake. I'm not returning it only because it would cost me more to send it back than to just keep it"
1,What a Disappointment,"This bag is absolutely useless. I usually read reviews before buying anything online, but for some reason, I didn't before buying this bag. Big mistake. It holds nothing - the dimensions are totally off and the picture appearing in the add is totally deceiving. You would be lucky if you could get a single towel in it. Also, like other reviewers, I found the straps to be sewed on in a ridiculous manner, making it impossible to even stretch out the bag to get items inside. Will not but from this seller again. Totally deceitful advertising."
2,Pool bag,"The bag is a nice size -- it can hold a towel and bathing suit, goggles, etc. It has a drawstring at the top of the bag to keep it closed, but after less than a week of use the stitching began to come apart. We can still use the bags but the drawstring closure is useless now."
2,Can't play it,It does not have a full octave and it's almost impossible to play the last 3 notes. (3 out of 7 notes could not be played...)
5,simplicity at its best,"I have been a string-instrument player for 30 years now. Then I got this thing a year ago - with no background or lessons and just started playing it. I absolutely love it! It is, as my friend dryly pointed out ""just a stick with holes in it"". But at the same time, he had to admit that it had a lovely sound - kind of.. down to earth tone. This Low D size takes some getting used to in the stretch of fingering, but its worth the effort - and all for well under $20. I took the wax colored strings off (I think that they are supposed to keep it from splitting) and just waxed the ends a bit. No splits after months and it looks cooler w/o the colored bands I think. I'd like to cut and wrap some sort of copper tape around the ends maybe. I can get two a little over two octaves from this and it also is very well in pitch so far as I can tell. Yeah - get the whole set and go nuts.UPDATE: December 2007 - it still hasn't split."
4,Great Heart Rate Monitor,"Love the monitor. Finally found one with the featurs I was looking for. Small in size and with the heart rate and % of maximum HR displayed at the same time. Wish the % numbers were bigger and not so close to the side of the face and would like the backlight to stay on longer, but not major flaws."
3,Complex,Very complex to use but it does work and is a good bang for your buck if you feel like trying to figure it out
2,Go with the Polar,I followed the instrucions but was unable to set it. Was too complicated. Go with the Polar HR monitor. It's easier to set up and some gym equipment is set up to read your heart rate from the Polar transmitter.
1,Worst Danielle Steel ever!,"This book was a huge disapointment. I kept looking at the cover to because I couldn't believe Danielle Steel actually wrote this. I still think someone might have slipped a book written by a twelve year old between the covers. I literally had to force myself to finish it with the hope that it would get better. It never did. Dull, boring, dull. Go someplace else it you want entertainment. You won't find it here."
4,No Greater Love,Great story. I love Danielle Steele. I love stories about Titanic too so this was good reading material that I did not want to put down.
2,Disappointing,"Edwina Winfield's parents and fiancé die when the Titanic sinks. Edwina and her younger siblings survive and when they return home they have to try to rebuild their lives and Edwina takes on the responsibility of raising the younger siblings, while also trying to keep the family newspaper afloat. We get to follow their lives for over a decade, as Edwina's brothers and sisters grow up and follow their ambitions while she herself seems happy as a spinster and surrogate mother.The book has tragedy, glamour and love, but the characters are not very interesting and the writing repetitive and uninspiring and never made me really interested or emotionally involved in the story. ""No Greater Love"" is a quick and undemanding read but also dull at times and ultimately unrewarding and disappointing, considering how interesting a novel about a family of Titanic survivors could have been."
3,Danielle Steel has a nasty little habit,of writing the same story over and over and over and over and over again. The only thing that changes are the years and the names of the characters.
5,This book is one of Steel's best.,This book will leave you hoping for Danielle to write millions of books just on this subject and the Titantic. It tells the heart-wrenching story of two lovers and the dreadful tragedy that occurs during the story. It left me amazed and stunned with the major facts and happenings that occured on the sinking of the Titantic.
5,Danielle Steel's best book ever!,"After her mother, father, and fiance die on the maiden voyage of the Titanic, Edwina Winfield must raise her younger brothers and sisters. This is an amazing book about love, life, and death"
5,Best Danielle Steel book that I have read so far.,"""No Greater Love"" written by Danielle Steele is probably the best book I have ever read. I kept thinking about it for days afterwards. I read this book in the spring of '95 and afterwards I had to find out every possible fact I could find out about the actual sinking on the Titanic. I was so happy when the movie Titanic came out last year. It added to what I had already learned about the actual incident. I think a movie over this story would be an excellant idea. It has been four and a half years since I read this book and I still regard it as one of the best books ever. I average reading one to two books per week so I've read a lot of stories and this one remains my all time favorite. Great job Danielle!"
1,Sad Excuse for a Book ....About the Titanic or Not,"This is probably the worst book I have ever read. I have read other Danielle Steele novels, so the choice for that was pretty hard but this is by far her worst. It is written mainly on a 4th/5th grade reading level. The characters were either so cardboard that you couldn't care less about them of dispicable creeps - including Miss Longsuffering herself. My advice to someone considering reading this one is - don't bother."
1,"VPC Yes, Win 2K version No!","You need to stay away from this version of VPC 5. The Win 2K OS does not come as a seperate disk. If the need ever arises to reinstall the OS, it looks like you will have to reinstall the complete VPC program. This could destroy any specific configurations to other operating systems you may have installed within VPC 5.This issue has not been addressed by Connectix, the product developer. I have looked on their website and FAQ forums and I have not observed any fix for the reinstallation problem.My suggestion is that you purchase the basic VPC 5 program without the OS and that you purchase Win 2K seperately. I would avoid purchasing the Connectix OS pack and just purchase the OS directly. I have installed 7 different OS from Linux 4.5 to 7.0, Win 95/98/SE, Win NT, MSDOS 5 and 6 and have not run into any problems during the installation."
4,Which do you really desire?,"Running a PC operating system is somewhat unusual on a Macintosh but is often needed. Macs do not deal with .exe and .com file extensions and for good reason. They are the ones that most often carry the virus which plagues the windows industry. Virtual PC for Mac with Win 2000 is good if you desire a network setup due to its compatability with Win NT 4.0.This version (5) will run on both OS 9 and OS X but remember that it requires alot of RAM and still runs sluggish when compared to the Mac. If you have to be in the PC spectrum but want the ease of owning a Macintosh, then this is a good choice."
1,Not Mac 8500 w/ G3/11gb hard drives,"After you try to load this software on a Mac 8500 w/G3 w/ 1 gb hard drive, you are told that the internal hard drive must be able to accept 1.5 gb.Moving everything but the system file to attached 10gb drive still won't allow it to load.Also you learn that the G3 must run at 400mhz.Sure would have been nice to have had this info before spending [$$$]. Never even got close to loading Windows2000!"
1,Problems in woodturning,"Unless you like reading half a sentence or half the page, half the photcopied page, prefer to see HALF of a drawing.....need I say more. If my sons friend hadn't spilled a Mountain Dew Code Red on the book, I would send it back. If you really intend to buy this extremely poor reproduction, call me, I will send you my copy for free and pay the postage. Simply pathetic."
2,A little vague,"I guess I was expecting more, I don't think it's written for a 6-7 year old. I was expecting more in terms on content and easy of reading for a beginning reader."
2,"Good singer and music, bad recording quality","The songs are good, but the recording and sound qualities are not. I like very much the Zazies's songs, the DVD Tour des Anges is very good, but I am disappointed whith this DVD."
4,Worship Jamz,"I bought this CD for my 8 year old son, but all three of my kids love it (5 and 2). It is songs they have sung at bible camp, etc. but very up-beat. They have listened to it over and over, and it is a CD I also enjoy! This is a big plus when your music selection is limited to your children's choices!"
5,The coolest christian kids music in the world,I love Worship Jamz! The songs are really cool and fun. I really recomend it!!!!!
1,Worst Attempt Ever,This CD collection is the worst attempt ever at trying to make Christian Music popular. Don't bother buying.
3,Disappointed but not hating it.,"It wasn't real clear to my ignorant self that this was a CD of hit songs not sang by the singers who made them hits. While that was very disappointing, my children listen to the CD and enjoy it."
1,crappier than kidz bop!,"this sucks so much. its worse than kidz bop so it must be horrible! this sucks. dont buy it. if you like christian music,look at another cd at all costs!"
2,Don't buy this!,"The DVD ""JFK: The Mysterious Death of Number Thirty-Five"" is really adisaster! I'm sorry to say this! Not so much in what it has to say, but technically!Firstly; the introduction is repeated! (don't they chech the film before ending the editing?)Secondly (and worst!); the background music is louder than the voice of the speaker, making it periodically impossible to hear what's going on!Thirdly; so enoying with all these break-ups with titles and choices to make between all the timy (and short) chapters!Well, talk about being over-ambitious!To sum it up; A amateurish production with really tiring result!Such a pity and such a waist!Christer Lindstrom in Sweden!"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"In my opinion this film is a total waste of time. I have seen almost all of the JFK Assassination DVDs, and the best are THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY (1-6), THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY(7), which the Johnson family forced the History Channel to stop showing and selling, and JFK 3 SHOTS THAT CHANGED AMERICA."
5,expectations fully met,great to see this era & subject fully reviewed//books were in lovely shape and arrived on schedule/quite satisfied//a must for any 1960's lover with great taste in music
4,"A Few Misses, But A Solid Effort With A Few Gold Tracks","All is a curious little creature as far as modern punk bands go, and Mass Nerder is a prime example of that, with a few absolutely brilliant tracks mixed in with some terribly forgettable ones. Until I Say So and Refrain are the sorts of sincere, heartfelt and sharply melodic songs that really good punk bands should be writing, and Honey Peeps, in my opinion, is one of the best punk songs that you can't help but smile to. And Think The World and World's On Heroin are your stock-standard witty, melodic pop-punk songs that are impossible not to like. but then the rest of the songs... I'll Get There, Silence, and oh god, Romantic Junkie - they really shouldn't have bothered with them at all. but hell, i'd pay the full album price just for Honey Peeps, so really, the rest of the songs are bonuses!"
2,Disaster in the Jungle,"This book is mainly about a girl, her parents, a young Indian guide, and a photographer who go out into South America looking for the secret palace of an Inca king. Throughout the story, they face many problems with disease, landscape, hostile Indians, and some other unexpected problems that occur during their journey. The main character is Paula who is invited to come on the expedition by her dad, and she has a hard time adjusting in the jungle for quite a while.I didn't really like this book because it wasn't very interesting. In the beginning the plot goes really slow and nothing seems to happen at all, and then when something does happen you already knew it was going to happen a chapter ago. This book was okay some of the time. However, I wouldn't recommend reading this book."
4,Actually surprised,"I wasn't expecting much when I picked this book to read but was pleasantly surprised. It has an interesting mix of spy elements including an inept MI6 agent from Great Britain, a CIA good guy brought out of forced retirement and lo and behold, who would have guessed that the Catholic Church has their own worldly, suave and debonair James Bond! The story could have used more character development but all in all it was a fast and pleasant read."
4,Great Comeback,"Welcome back the Blossoms! This is a reunion album, but the band really doesn't explore any new territory here. It's basically the next Gin Blossoms album, albeit after many (too many) years and a few other musical experiments (Gas Giants to name one.)Recommended for power pop fans and anyone who remembers the Gin Blossoms heyday."
4,pop/rock brilliance,"These guys are always going to live in the shadow of ""Jealousy"". It would be near impossible to write a better ,more perfect song. But, not impossible to write some that are just as good !This album is full of beautiful melodies,great harmonies,jangling guitars,and, i love it!!!This is pop/rock at it's best. It may have been recorded with a smaller budget than some of their other recordings, but,who cares .""Big Budget"" usually means ""Big Producer"" which always means,someone getting between the band and their music.I'm really glad that the Gin Blossoms are back.Now, if i could just convince them to come to Cairns(Australia)"
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this album for years. The thing is, I have had guarded expectations, given how long it took for them to get this together, I started to believe some of the critics that Doug Hopkins was the heart and soul of the group. This album proves that isn't the case. I think this album rivals New Miserable Experience in creativity and quality, which is hard to do given that NME was such a great album. Congrats to the boys on a wonderful comeback. I will continue to lobby local stations to spin this thing."
3,not all there this time,"maybe I'm writing this too early, but i listened to this online. I wasn't hooked nearly as quickly as I was on the two previous efforts. There are moments-the new single, ""learning the hard way,"" is as good as anything they do. ""come on hard"" and ""heart shaped lockets"" are two more songs worthy of download. Nothing else really struck me. There isn't really anything wrong with the other songs, but they don't really offer anything new. Gin Blossoms have never been master of creativity nor musicianship, which is fine but it only carries you so far. The third time, it's time for a sound change. And I don't see it here. Call me cycnical, but if the other two cds caught in my head right away and this one hasn't, something is lacking. Die hard fans, get it, but if you are like me, you'll find yourself drifting back to ""found out about you."""
3,Mediocre Lodge Victory,"This is not a bad album, but it certainly isn't as good as ""New Miserable Experience"" or ""Congratulations...I'm Sorry."" At times I felt like I was listening to Tom Petty rather than The Gin Blossoms. Don't get me wrong, I like Tom Petty, but not when I'm expecting the Gin Blossoms.The main difference here to me is that this album has a lot of good songs, but no great songs. Their earlier albums had several great songs."
2,The Heart-breaking Letdown.,"I really thought that when I purchased this album that I would fall in love with the Gin Blossoms all over again. I saw them on their first national tour back in 1993, and had been hooked ever since. I guess they've grown up, and are ready to take on the...... Adult Contemporary Scene. After listening to this album twice in a row, I cannot tell the difference between any of the songs. I'm sure there is a story in each one, but the melodies, guitar chords, and flat out boring drums make it impossible to make an adjustment."
1,Major Lodge Disappointment,"I guess I shouldn't expect everything to be the same old same old, but on this album the Gin Blossoms have done a little switching...but not in a good way.This album starts off strong and gradually fades to songs like ""Super Girl,"" an all-out cringe-worthy song that could have been written by a 12-year-old boy. The lyrics are pretty weak throughout the album and the albums lack those songs that made the Gin Blossoms stand out in the mid-'90s. These songs are all drab, mid-tempo, half-brained attempts at what they used to be able to do.But then again, why should we expect anything different from a band whose creative peak was realized over 10 years ago?"
2,"If we wait 20 years, can we get 6 good songs?","Let me start by saying that I LOVE the Gin Blossoms. Anytime a band takes 10 years off from making a record it has to worry you as to what they will sound like.I will say this, ""Someday Soon"" is an awesome song. But there might only be 2 other good songs on the CD. It's not that they are totally bad, it still sounds like the GB minus Philip on drums, but the songs just aren't that good.I'm with that other reviewer who asked why don't that record ""What"" and put it on a record.And for those reviwers who said Doug Hopkins isn't missed must be on crack. Yes, the Gin Blossoms still sound the same but the lyrics aren't even close. Hopkins wrote words from the heart. They were real, genuine, not words to make something rhyme.Too bad Robin couldn't have written some more for this record.My high hopes were crushed with this one."
3,"OK, but nothing like NME","How do you top New Miserable Experience? You don't. This is a fair CD made by talented musicians. It's got a Gin Blossom's sounds.....sort of. It's not bad. Niether do I find it particularly good. I admit to having been ridiculously spoiled by NME, a masterpiece. Neither I, nor their sales numbers could rate GB as one-hit wonders, but this isn't quite up to their first offering in my opinion. (How could it be?)"
4,A True Taste of 90s Pop/Rock,"In a time when pop radio is overrun by hip-hop, finding truly good rock-pop/rock is a difficult task. This album is one of those rare exceptions, allowing me to hear what I loved about the music I listened to growing up in the 90s. It can't measure up toNew Miserable ExperienceorCongratulations I'm Sorry, but it's close. And it's one of those pop/rock CDs that can be appreciated."
5,I Love This Album!!,"I've loved the Gin Blossoms since I was in 6th grade in the mid 90's when hits like ""Allison Road"" and ""Found out About You"" came out. I honestly thought that they had hung it up, then I saw that they had a new album out and had to pick it up before I had even heard a song.I absolutely love it!! Fits rights in with previous Gin Blossoms albums. If you like anything in the past you'll like this one.""Learning the hard Way"" is an instant classic. ""Come on Hard"" has a great drive, and ""Super Girl"" is just traditional Gin Blossoms. I love it all. Hope for more albums in the future!!"
5,Major League Comeback!,"These guys haven't missed a beat after all these years.This album is more textured and harmony based than their earlier efforts,and in some ways that makes for a more satisfying collection that seems to get better after each listening.With songs as strong as ""Long Time Gone"",""Curious Thing"" and ""Let's Play Two"" this Power Pop masterpiece already sounds like a greatest hits album.Buy it!You won't be disappointed!"
5,Punky Brewster,"I purchased this D.V.D. for a friends daughter, who surprisingly saw a clip on youtube and became a fan. The D.V.D. came on time and has been watched and enjoyed. Obviously, I am a satisfied customer."
3,Young'un,"This was a book I read years and years ago. I wanted to reread it as an old adult. It had been a favorite as a teenager and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered. It would have been a 4 to 5 star as a teenager, but now I find it as a 2 to 3 star. I purchased it from Amazon as a used book."
4,Angra meets Edenbridge,"Thalion is a Brazilian progressive/power metal band with a sound very reminiscent of countrymen Angra and Shaman, but with female lead vocals. In fact, members of both bands guest on this album, as does former Helloween vocalist Michael Kiske, who lends his legendary voice to the closing song the Encounter.Thalion vocalist Alexandra Liambos doesn't sing in the operatic Nightwish style, which is fortunate since there are already more than enough Nightwish copycat bands out there. Instead, her style is closer to that of Sabine Edelsbacher from Edenbridge, though perhaps not as strong. It is clear and emotional, and works quite well with this type of music.Fans of progressive/power metal, particularly fans of bands with female vocals, should find plenty to enjoy in Thalion.The track listing is as follows:1. Atmospheres2. Follow the Way3. Show Me the Answers4. Wait for Tomorrow5. Another Sun6. Solitary World7. Life is a Poetry8. the Journey9. Long Farewell10. the Encounter"
4,not much to it..,"we have this book. my 18 month old sometimes asks to read it, but only because its a dog. there's not much to this story and nothing he can really relate to at his age. cute illustrations, short story but not a must in our family."
4,Nice Winter Book.,Great book for young toddlers or preschoolers just learning to read. The book is very thick and durable and great for the cold months.
1,I hate this book,I read to my kids every night and I cringe when I come across this one in the rotation. It has zero flow to it. It honestly seems like a japanese book that was poorly translated to English.
3,Poor Sound,The film appeared to be in good condition. When I viewed the movie the picture was good but the sound has a lot of background noise. This was very disappointing.
3,"Nice product, but if you're using OS X wait for Virtual PC 6","Connectix Virtual PC is a good product at base, but release 5 for OS X is a ""new"" and weak version. I've used prior versions of VPC successfully under Mac OS 9 to run some of my old PC software and to access proprietary corporate web sites that are written for Windows only. The software installed very easily, it automatically picked up my Mac internet connection (via Airport and cable modem), and it ran the Windows software really well. A bonus is that when Windows crashes (as it always does, eventually), my Mac doesn't have to be rebooted -- I just relaunch Windows within VPC. That's better than running Windows on my old Dell machine.However, the version 5.0 release on OS X is basically a new product, and it's EXTREMELY slow. Wait for 6.0 and see if the speed issue has been addressed. Connectix has announced version 6.0, but as of this date (Dec 20, 2002), it hasn't appeared on Amazon."
4,Rating me or a software,"Mr. Joachim Klehe,acting +30 years in hard- and software business, doesn't mean anything, when you need customer support after installing a programm which runs in tousands of macs.I do not feel competent to judge a software rigidly, because I have no time and not sufficient practice with this programm, but if the Mac Authority MACWORLD gives it ***** it can't be so bad. But registering software, I can even give you some hints. - Hans Jürgen Ruppert"
2,Awww...not so lobstery...,"The lobster bits in this soup are tiny, tiny, tiny...ok - nonexistent bits. The flavor is nicely salty and can be doctored to be really good, but it is thinner than I thought, with less lobster flavor than I hoped. I was disappointed and gave away ten of the 12 cans."
4,Made in USA!,"I was replacing the shocks on my car and decided to do the springs while I was at it. These units are made in USA and are reasonably priced. They stand almost 2"" taller than my original springs, which have about 160,000 miles on them. I'm not sure if that is because the originals are beat or what. I installed them anyway, and the car rides better loaded now, which is OK since I use it for work and carry lots of gear in the trunk. I expect they'll settle in after a couple of months. Overall I'm a happy camper."
1,Disappointment,"Item purchased as a gift very early in time. Unfortunately, when the gift was received and viewed it was too late to return. Though the item was supposedly ""new"" the CDs had bad scratches that did not give a complete byline of the store.Very disappointed in quality of CDs."
3,Imperfect,"Several of my dvds wont play, not happy. I love the show, its my favorite. I would love to have a part..."
4,"Guns make you stupid, duct tape makes you smart","Season one of this show blew me away, I loved it, however they seem to be moving more and more towards the same old guns, explosions and no police in sight formula that makes up any american action show. Still one of the best shows around, but steadily losing ground. If not for the first season putting the hook in me I doubt I would be watching. The cast is the one element that remains positive."
5,MacGuyver ain't got nothin on me!,I love this show. He's a modern day MacGuyver and very funy to watch. I'm also a huge fan of Bruce Campbell and he is a huge reason the show is as good as it is. This season is very good too.
5,burn notice,the package arrived in good shape and on time.i have not watched it yet because it's a christmas gift for my husband.we will be watching after the holidays.have watched some episodes on tv but we don't like waiting a week to see the next one.
1,Burn Notice,I give it 1 star for poor quality. It was a illegal burned copy. It skips and the case color looks faded. I am a die hard fan of Burn Notice Seasons 5 stars all the way.
3,DVD,Got the package on time. When we opened it the first dvd fell out because the center piece to hold it in was broken
2,Not up to standards.,"Having purchased Season One and Two of Burn Notice and was very pleased with the contents, I was very, very disappointed when I received the discs for Season Three. Missing were the special commentaries of the directors and main actors and deleted scenes, etc. What was inexcusable was the missing scene selections for each episode and the synopsis of each episode. I wish I had known that these basic options were not included; I would not have opened the package and I would have immediately returned the purchase.Unhappy BN Fan."
3,Watch this,"Not as good as Season one & two and season 4 was better. We didn't need any extra regular characters, better with just the four."
5,My Favorite Show!!,"We LOVE Burn Notice, and are anxiously awaiting the release of Season Four. Fiona is my favorite!! but all the characters are unique and play well off of each other (except maybe the brother, Nate). I loved that they had an episode where Tyne Daly became Sharon Gless' friend (""Cagney and Lacy""). Gless plays quite the character as Michael's mom. Having the DVD allows us to go back and review things which enhances understanding of the plot and lets us pick up humorous lines. Lots of things getting shot and blown up...but then Fiona is that kind of gal!"
5,Can't Get Enough!,"Once again Michael, Fiona and Sam are fantastic! It's a thrill ride from beginning to end! Love it!"
3,The Down Season,"Didn't think this season was as well written or fun as the previous two seasons, or the just completed fourth. Many of the episodes seemed done in a herky jerky manner, as if the writers knew what they wanted, but hadn't quite gotten it all finished before the episode began shooting. Still, I would have given this dvd set 4 stars except there is nothing to it except the episodes. Yes there is a stuntman section and the ComiCon bit, but as dvd extras, seriously lacking. I expect some commentaries and some extras from writers and directors talking about the season and what they did and thought. As is, the only reason I purchased this was to keep my set complete, and hope the Fourth Season dvd set is better."
4,action packed and thrilling,I watched Season 4 first so I had to go back and watch Seasons 1-3 to catch up. The finale with Simon was not as exciting as I thought. It gets much better in Season 4. I like this show though and will continue on to Season 5 since I am caught up.
1,"People in Richmond, VA love it","People in Richmond, VA love it. If you know anything about Richmond....well, an open mind would be an endangered species there. Perhaps I have said enough on that subject. More specifically, if you are looking for a book based in historical facts, look somewhere else."
3,Disappointment in the last chapter of the book,"This well put together story held my interest until the last chapter. My first disappointment was Cassie's attitude towards her betrothed. Most of all I had hoped there would have been a better resolution between Connor, Ramsey Forbes and the whole Glen Gray affair. Maybe Ms Madl has a sequel in mind? This book left a lot of open doors. If there is a sequel, I'd certainly be interested in reading it."
5,A Well-Balanced Account,"The sad story of what happened in Deir Yassin is told through the research of 12 individuals whose papers are joined together here to make this book. It is written in much the same style as ""Iraq Under Siege"".The story of the massacre at Deir Yassin lives in infamy, but its history is quickly becoming forgotten as urban development now covers the site... a site that ironically (or not) sits within a stone's throw of the Holocaust Museum, Yad Vashem, in Israel in somber rememberance of the 6 million Jewish innocents that were massacred by Hitler in WWII.Chapter 11, ""Christianity and the Future of Israeli-Palestinian Relations"" is one of the best written in the book. All chapters are thought provoking and written with succinct clarity.I especially appreciated this book not only for its candor, but because it maintained an essence of ecumenicalism between Christians, Jews, and Muslims that many other books do not afford. This is a must read for EVERYONE!"
5,An eye opener HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"The book is amazing and very easy to read. What I love about it is that its not a long book but still manages to retain all the important details and shows exactly what happened in Deir Yassin.I would recommend the book to everyone who is looking for the other side of the story.For everyone who doesnt believe that ""Deir Yassin Never Happened"". For everyone one who wish to understand the atrocities commited by the Israelis."
5,Easy to work with....,This stuff is great to use for homeowners wanting to repair holes/dents/etc. It's fast and looks great when dry. I do a slight sand to even out the wall. Paints well. Make sure and close the lid tightly or it will dry out.
3,"Good product, far to small for my needs",The product is excellent but the value is poor. You'll find twice the size for about the same price at the local hardware store.
2,Jennie,Not impressed. I see value only as a collectible if one is building a library of Broadway musicals. In full context on stage it might have more appeal.
3,bought for class but kept the book.,i bought it for a class but decided to keep the book. i dont fully understand alexies style but it isnt the worst thing i've read. wouldnt spend more than $10-15 on it unless you need it for a class or love alexie or something like that.good condition and fast shipping.
2,"Writer good, stories not good","I have read and enjoyed much of Sherman Alexie's work, but unfortunately the stories in this volume are not up to par. I was constantly wondering while reading them if some of these are very early efforts, (they remind me of college freshman level writing) which were dug up for publication. I expect better from Sherman Alexie.Also, he seems to be rehashing the same themes and ideas that have been used in so much of his other work.One of the stories entitled, What You Pawn I Will Redeem, is a great story. The others really were disappointing in both style and content."
3,I'm Glad I Persevered...,"I didn't quite enjoy the first couple of stories in this selection and might have just as easily dismissed the rest. I found several other stories very rewarding, including ""What You Pawn I Will Redeem,"" ""Do You Know Where I Am?"" and ""The Life and Times of Estelle Walks Above.""For me, it wasn't the elements of the story that were specific to the various experiences of the Spokane Indians that held my interest. Rather, it was the universality of certain themes... devotion to family, regret, longing. I wonder, though, if the praise Alexie has received is due to his standing as a Native American author, rather than simply a talented short story writer, regardless of his ethnicity."
3,"Some Good, Some Not So Good","Sherman Alexie is a fine writer, but some of the stories in this book remind me of college freshman level stories, where the writer wants to throw in a bunch of references to things they've recently learned to make themself appear sophisticated. I was a bit shocked that a writer of Alexie's talent would have such sloppy stuff published. Also I agree with the other reviewer who noticed that Alexie is rehashing themes that are becoming very redundant is his stories.That said, a few of the stories in this book show the great talent that I expect from someone like Sherman Alexie."
2,Not Alexie's best,"I have read much of Sherman Alexie's work, and I found most of the stories in this collection to be mediocre, and frankly, disappointing. One story, entitled ""What You Pawn I Will Redeem"" is the exception, and shows how good Alexie can be when he's writing at his best."
5,A real gem!,"All the stories in this book have Spokane Indians as main characters, but the stories are really about all of humanity, with its humor, tragedy, cruelty, and redemption. Every story made me laugh at some point, and every story touched me deeply at some point. The characters have to deal with poverty, others' preconceptions, their own deeply held stereotypes, good luck, bad luck, and just life in general. One homeless man tries to find $1000 to buy back his grandmother's pow-wow regalia. Another man honors one parent's death by giving up basketball and the other's death by taking it back up in middle life. Every highly readable story grabbed me from beginning to end. This is the first book I've read by Alexie, but it won't be my last."
5,alexie,I've read about 10 of Alexies' books and they begin to run together since many are composed of poetry and short stories. Some of the same character names are used more than once as well as the characters themselves. I must say that I have enjoyed every one of them. I can't seem to stop reading his books. They flow with such ease and constantly make me think. He has become one of my favorite writers.
5,Nice.,"Ten Little Indians by Sherman AlexieSherman Alexie writes from the heart. In this book of short stories, he tells nine different tales of contemporary northwest indian culture. One gets the feeling that his own life is wrapped up and hidden somewhere within many of them. Or perhaps he was sitting and listening to the stories of others, and they became pages in their turn.The stories open up a piece of society that we (the non-indians) wrap either in a cloak of mysticism or in a burlap bag to hide away. Alexie says, No, wait. Look at who this person really is. Here's what you think you know, and here is what is real. Deal with it.Laugh, cry, then laugh some more. Then pick up a mirror."
3,Not Vintage Alexie,"Since I am a fan of Sherman Alexie's, and have read all of his previous works, I found this book disappointing. If you have read any of his other works you will note some redundancy, and perhaps be left with a sort of ""deja vu"" feeling.While one or two are noteworthy, the stories are milking the same Alexie themes, now getting tired. His displeasure with the ""greyness of Seattle weather"" has gotten old. He has exhaustively explored the impact of young men on strong women and a matrilineal culture. His incorporation of sexual innuendo and humor have grown puerile. And, he is beating the basketball theme into the ground.I think it is time for Alexie to take a hiatus to ponder and perhaps devote his considerable talent to explore some of his other experiences...or to take the time to have some. The themes in this book are like orange juice concentrate to which 4 cans of water have been added."
5,Breath-taking!,"This book truly delivers what the title promises.From all around the world, in all sorts of environments, with all sorts of people, on all sorts of horses, Julie has found the greatest. Her life-long love of horses is clearly there to see. Gorgeous, sumptuous photographs and a lively writing style all go to make a book that has a place front and centre of my book shelf."
5,"Music From the Ukraine - soothing, meditative and cool!","Italian Guitarist, Flavio Cucchi is well-known in Europe for his guitar interpretations. He was born in Florence, and his wife Marta, who is an artist, does many of his CD jacket designs, although the CD title improperly says ""the Ukraine"" rather than ""Ukraine"", the difference being that ""the Ukraine"" refers to a province of Russia and the former Soviet Union and ""Ukraine"" signifies the inependent and free Ukraine and its cultural renaissance. Some of the praises about Mr. Cucchi: ""One of the best guitarists in Europe"" (CD Classica) ""...he is a musician of the highest order.He has an incredible facility for speed..he can also provide moments of intense, slow beauty and a passion..""(Classical Guitar) ""Flavio Cucchi, certainly one of the most brilliant interpreters in the panorama of the guitar in the last years"" (Strumenti e Musica) ""An extremely complete musician"" (les cahiers de la guitare) ""A true virtuoso"" (Ham & High)"
1,One of the Worst Toys Ever,"This is one of the worst toys ever. It is poorly made. On the very first flight, the plane crashed into the ground nose first and the styrofoam split apart. The plane flew a total of about 8 feet. The same as a paper airplane. Our 11 year old was heart broken. We glued the styrofoam back together and tried a second flight. On the second flight, the plane flew about 50 feet. However, when it landed, the styrofoam that held the engine onto the wing broke apart. Do not buy this toy. it is not worth the money and it will only disappoint the recipient."
1,Does not fit,"'Perfect Match' is a bit misleading, seeing as how it does not match the hose connector. The hole in the receptacle is too small to force the existing hose connector through."
1,Sure not universal,Looks good quality. Not a universal replacement. It is better to by the water sprayer with the entire hose. This didnt work. I will be returning it
5,Wouldn't be without it,This product is great and one box lasts me six months. Dishes come out clean and shiny with no grit or clouding. Also helps speed up the drying process.
5,Great jazz combo music!,"Ruby Braff ... Scott Hamilton ... Dave McKenna. They were among the best of the current cornet, tenor sax and piano players when they recorded this a decade ago, and they remain among the best today. That's all you really need to know about this fine Concord CD, except that the tunes are as excellent as the musicians. It should be a part of any jazz collection."
5,"It's like ""Love and Marriage ... ""","The old song, ""Love and Marriage,"" said it best: ""You can't have one without the other."" And you can't have this CD without owning Volume 1 of Ruby Braff's recordings with the New England Songhounds. If anything, Volume 2 is even better because it contains some songs left off the cassette version. Scott Hamilton and Dave McKenna join Braff in being as good or better than on the first volume."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I am exremly disappointed! The phone has already stopped working! I took it to AT&T; and they said it could not be fixed, so I had to buy another phone. Since this was my first experience buying from Amazon,do I have any recource?!......Lynne"
3,Did I get a new phone?,"Very disappointed! I ordered this phone for my Mom as a Christmas present. I decided a few days ago to actually charge it and make sure it was okay so it would be ready for use on Christmas Day and to my surprise the back panel that covers the battery compartment was not only a different shade of pink but it also does not fit flush with the rest of the phone, almost as though it were for a different model. So my question is Did I really get a new phone? Apart from that if I return it I can only get a refund as the item is out of stock. With Christmas a few weeks away I am really disappointed that this is the case and quite frankly don't know what to do now because ordering a different phone might be too risky in terms of the timeframe for delivery. I think, as a good customer the least Amazon should do is find the right part and send it to me free of charge so my Mom can have a great surprise this Christmas."
1,TIN CAN,"It was charged after receiving, but that was it. Couldn't get it to work. Brought it over to T-Mobile. Technicians tested and rechecked. Keys were found to be stuck or frozen. That is a shame. The unit is quite attractive, but light weight. Feels like a tin can. I feel that even if it worked, wouldn't last maybe after a few use."
2,Item Was Not What Was Advertised,"I purchased a Motorola RAZR V3 unlocked phone with camera as a graduation gift for my daughter. The satin pink color. The phone I received is two toned with an AT & T logo attached. I was extremely disappointed, it was as if the seller had spare parts and put together this phone. I would not purchase from this seller again."
1,Motorola RAZR V3 (pink),"The battery life on this phone is about 1 day if you do NOT use it and about 15 minutes if you do. I've lost a few calls and I have to continuously charge it to be able to get a call in. I realize I purchased without warranty, realizing this is an older phone, but would not recommend anyone buying them. I ended up moving my SIM card to another phone altogether. I love the look and feel of the RAZR, but the value should lie in whether it works well or not, and it doesn't. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Not so great,"The first one they sent to me had problem with the screen. The second one was working fine until last week. The battery doesn't work anymore. Its only been about 6 months since I bought it. When it worked, it did it's job."
4,Wonderful,"I like the raZR phones by Motorola because of their sleek design. This phone works well but I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because 1. the description said satin pink color the phone is hot pink (luckily it matched up with my favourite tank top) and 2. There is not much to do on it, no calculator or calender - it's sorta boring. BUT I love it! I love it! for its design."
3,Motorola Razr V3 Review - Seems to be a used one,"Even though the phone is functioning normally, the phone has scratches and one of the side button on the hinges was not there. The phone does not have any new phone look.The Amazon website should have mentioned the fact in their webpage, if it is a used one or a remanufactured one so that the buyer would have an idea in advance. I have purchased this phone from Amazon (though we had local sellers of the same phone where we could have bought the phone with 100% satisfaction) just because I had very good past experience with Amazon and almost all the purchases we make through Amazon.I did not have time to return it as I gifted that to my sister hence I advise other users to check it atleast once after you receive the item."
1,Shipped with wrong battery,"I was excited when opening the box but only to find out the battery enclosed is of the wrong type for the cell.It simply does not fit. With quality control like this, I will think twice before buying anything from this vendor."
2,Phone is cute and easy to use but.......,"I bought this phone because I always liked the RAZR, and the phone was cute and cheap. What a mistake! The phone does not hold a charge. I talked on the phone for a little over one hour and sent a few text messages, and the battery died! It doesn't even last one whole day. Also, the phone shut off for no reason. I also could not check my email; I kept getting error messages. The phone was an AT&T phone, and even after I configured it for my carrier, it still didn't work right. I suspect this may have been a refurbished phone, even though it was advertised as ""new"". I think these phones are hit or miss. Let the buyer beware!"
3,Not the right color,I like the phone and aside from the battery not working and having to purchase another one. The only thing that i found wrong was the color. I ordered a satan pink phone and they sent me a hot pink phone. I guess you get what you pay for isnt that the old saying
3,Battery to the phone/Bad,Well I liked the phone but it wont keep a charge so I to spend another [...] bucks to order a battery on line. I don't know if the battery I ordered is any good. I think its some kind of conspiricy to get more money out your pocket I guess times are really hard. Other than that the phone really worked great.
1,Not Happy At All,"I purchased this product and had high expectations. I was extremely disappointed. The phone that I recieved did not have a data device (allows downloads, view websites, and etc.) installed on it. For $60.00 i expect the phone to be able do the simplest function like downloading. NOT HAPPY! and returned asap! So buyer beware people."
4,nice product while it looked as it was in demo,"I bought this product as Unlocked, and found it is giving Cingular logo while booting also the Battary cover has AT&T; on it. the Battary cover has a darker color tone than the phone, the transparent plastic covering the phone for protection was dusty and look old as if it was in demo or on shelf exposed to dust for long time.I tried the Phone and it worked fine, specialy the battary as I was tricked before with a bad battary.so after I removed the plastics, , else than the collor tone difference, the phone works realy good"
2,Forget this phone!,"I oredered this phone from amazon because my other razor went kaput and AT & T no longersells the razor. Since I was so familiar with this product I wanted another one and foundit on Amazon. What I didn't realize was that, although the product was ""new"" and packagedas such, it was an old model of the razor and even less capable than the one I was replacing.Many of the short cut features of my old phone are not on this one and I find myself constantlyfrustrated that I have to do extra steps for the same result. For instance the texting requiresa couple extra steps as does the ability to find numbers in the address book. I can hardlywait to get an Iphone. Forget it...move on into the new era of product!"
1,Never worked,"This product never worked. I could not even talk on the phone-- the person on the other line came through very tinny, over so much static we could not make out what each other was saying. I tried several times. I should have returned it but ended up losing the box and sticking the phone in a drawer. I've had motorola phones I have liked, but this one was not even functional. Also the battery did not last even a respectable length of time."
1,It was a piece of junk and I would not say this unless it was truly awful. I like to give a good review but can't do it .,I wouldn't recommend this phone to anybody. It was throwed in the trash after having it a month. Bad choice.
2,Barely does the job,Back light does not work very worn looking. Keyes do not work. Really regret buying this phone. I use to own one like this and my old one was a lot better
5,Good Seller,"I ordered my phone for a FANTASTIC price, it wa shipped within a few days, I had a tracking number and it arrives before its scheduled time. When I recieved th phone it was exactly how they said it would look and I was VERY HAPPY!! THANK YOU!"
2,Nice phone poor battery,I bought this for a friend and as far as I could see the battery was new however when it said it was fully charged it would only last a couple of hours.
1,BOOOH!!!,"I wish I could say this book was good... but I can't. I have heard so many wonderful things about Molana Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha, but feel as though the translater has not done a very good in the translation.How frustrating!!Unfortunetly, the myster of humanity is more of a mystery after you read this book!"
2,Kind of weak,"I have all of Harem Scarem's cds and this is kind of tired and forced. Seems like they've explored some of these avenues before and there's not enough enough guitar work, which is a shame 'cause Pete Lesperence is really brutal. To me, the fizzle started a few cds back. The backing vocals are too low in the mix. Another real calling card for HS. Maybe I'm still looking for another ""Mood Swings"". The band seems to have lost their attitude."
2,"Nyeh,...","The lyrics to this song are inestimably poor. Their vulgarity is more tiresome than provocative in this day and age. They are sung with a fake lisp. The song cries out for melodies, which never arrive. There is the hint of a melody in the background chanting, so for that reason alone I'll give it two stars instead of one. But I do not recommened it. Gwen Stefani is capable of better records (like ""Cool"") that don't try quite so hard to be hip."
1,"DEAR GOD, TAKE ME NOW!!! (pt. 2)","Hollaback Girl is the worst song on this side of Underneath it all. I don't see why either song was so popular, it's just, ""I ain't no hollaback girl cuz this s!#@ is bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s."" It's great you know how to spell bananas, but that doesn't do jack s!#@ for the song."
1,Seriously!,"How old is Gwen Stefani?? She acts like she's 15! Plus, this song is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and what bad songwriting! She doesn't know how to write a proper song. Anybody who's stupid and loves to swear can write this song in 30 seconds."
1,This is H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E!!!,"Forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today's ""music"" too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them, ""Hollaback Girl"" is the absolute DUMBEST ""song"" I've ever had the displeasure to hear.There are two main parts to this travesty: 1. Where she says ""That's my sh**"" no less than a million times, and 2. She demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us.If this is supposed to be rap, Stefani failed miserably. If it's supposed to be dance, again, she failed miserably. To be honest, I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music.The fact that it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't have any requirements for their ears. - Donna Di Giacomo"
1,Going bananas!,"Gwen Stefani isn't singing an ode to Woody Allen's Cuban Revolution comedy,but teaching the her teen&preteen; fans to get hooked on phonics. Unfortunately for the rest of us. ""Hollaback Girl"" is yet another disposable bubblegum song.""Hollaback Girl"" is an infectious song,catchy in its own insidious way. Thankfully, Gwen Stefani will be collaborating with No Doubt again. As for this awful song,avoid it."
5,"A Promising Singer Who I Hope ""Hollabacks"" With A New One!","This song is the third single off of Gwen Stefani's CD, ""Love.Angel.Music.Baby."" As the follow-up to ""What You Waiting For?""and ""Rich Girl (featuring Eve),"" it does a tremendous job! Thehighlight of the song I think is when she pops into the thirdverse going, ""Let me hear you say this s@*$ is bananas!,"" and soon. This is a good song. She is a promising singer who's stillhitting radio charts with her new song, ""Cool."" I also hope that""Harajuku Girls"" becomes a single, because I like the song."
4,Haters should find something more constructive....,"How sad that Glenn Nippert ""musicologist"" had nothing better to do than listen to music he doesnt like and bad mouth people he is jealous of. Perhaps Glenn can spend his time on something more constructive like studying something he enjoys and can understand instead of being a self proclaimed ""musicologist"" .Gwen is amazing, beautiful, talented and adored by her fans.J. Chen, there is something on your radio that allows you to ""change the channel"", its phucken amazing. When you hear a song you dislike you can simply change to a new song and stop wasting your time writing about people you don't like for no apparent reason."
5,Steadfast and Accurate,"I used this paint with a Rustoleum striper. The paint is good, dries fast, and each can will give you about eight parking length stripes. You can get a more intense paint stripe by rolling the striper at a slower speed and using more paint. However, the paint will take longer to dry if it is applied thicker. I found that applying the paint in a thinner layer was sufficient for a parking area. In my application, I knew people would be using the parking within a short time after the painting was complete. In 30 minutes after application, people were walking on the stripes with no problem and it rained well before the recommended 8 hour cure time and again, there was no problem with the paint. This was easy to use and the job was fun to complete."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR ~Will not work in Rustoleum Marking Wand or Pistol,"I purchased this to use it with the Rustoleum Marking WandRust-Oleum 2393000 Professional Marking Wandonly to find out, it only works with the marking machine pictured on the can! It is over priced and the fact that it can only be used in the dang machine was not clear in the written description. EVEN WORSE IT COST MORE TO RETURN IT THAN IT IS WORTH."
3,Not bad for Lambert...,"It is the future and breeding is controlled by the government. John Brannick and his wife are about to illegally have their second child. They are caught making their way out of the country and put in a fortress, a large prison in which the prisoners are controlled via a small device placed in the intestine. Silly? Yes. Fun? Definitely. I honestly can't give this movie more than three stars, but it was a fun action flick. The gore is big here and fans of this kind of movie, like ""Robocop"" or ""Total Recall,"" will surely find much to like. Christopher Lambert does a nice job as the action hero who just wants to see his wife. The film is sort of like a futuristic ""Great Escape."" I had fun watching this film and if you're a fan of action or sci-fi, you should too."
2,"Great premise, that's pretty much wasted!","This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, far from it, but the truth is you'd be far more entertained re-watching The Matrix, or Blade Runner! The premise that the film works on is a good one, that's what initially grabbed my attention (along with some well edited trailers), but the execution is laughable. The cast are OK, the special effects are OK, but the script is terrible and the ending unfulfilling. If you're a sci-fi fanatic like me, you're probably going to watch this movie anyway, but I'll tell you this, once you've watched it you won't be in a hurry to see it again."
3,Demolition Man Meets Riddick,"1/2 Riddick because a husband and wife are sentenced to a prison 30 or so stories below surface (for having more than one kid). 1/2 Demolition Man becase of the ""big brother"" like atmosphere and the lame acting. I know, it sounds great! How could this movie not be a blockbuster? Well, Chris Lambert isn't exactly a great actor. This movie isn't exactly good. And, oh yeah, the plot sucks! But it's an enjoyable watch anyway. For some reason my left brain kept telling me ""change the channel"" but my right brain just couldn't do it. I wish I could give this movie 2 1/2 stars, because I didn't really like it...but I didn't dislike it either. Plus the fact that Lambert has a gunfight with a diesel truck at the end really adds something to the story. It may be worth watching on a movie channel, but paying for this film might upset a few people out there."
2,"Christopher Lambert stars, .pathetic DVD transfer!","Christpher Lambert and Kurtwood Smith(That 70's show,Broken Arrow) star in this OK movie about a escpe proof prison in the future.Christpher Lambert and his wife try to cross the border to have a child of their own.They are sent to a prison run by Kurtwood Smith as it's sadistic warden.Lambet and his cellmates plan a way to escape from the prison. The DVD of this movie only has the pan/scan,modified movie(no widescreen/letterbox! )scene selction,production notes,cast and crew info! The problems with this DVD is there no commentary from stars,director,special effects etc! There is two side disk for those who want to watch it in letterbox! If you want to buy this DVD fine it's just you are better off with the VHS tape instead!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I can not believe that this move can be considered even OK. With such memorable lines. ""If you won't do it for me do it for my baby."" Or my favorites that points out one of my life truths ""You are clinging to your parole because you are a man."" The plot plays out in your head minutes before the action takes place on the screen. This move brings nothing new or even plausable to the screen. The ending of the movie will make you wonder why you didn't stop watching long before."
5,Quality stuff!!,"When i saw this movie back in the day, i was all like 'Yes!! this is too cool!' I recently watched Fortress again and it still holds up. Great action and well placed gore with a fairly elaborite story and excellent, exciting directing! Did i mention Christopher Lambert too?!"
3,Didn't help,"Good book for coding practice, but when I took the exam, it wasn't anything like the book or CD, unless I just didn't find it. If you happened to get those questions, yes it was, but didn't come across many of these questions."
3,Ducane Affinity 4100 natural gas grill,"Good value for the cost. There are a few negative items however. I bought this without seeing one in person, so I relied on description. The mfgr. & Amazon say it has 1/4""d. stainless steel wire cooking grates, but they only measure slightly more than 3/16"". I feel somewhat decieved by this, since its almost 25% less than advertised. I also had to call customer service because one wire end had already come detached from edge wire, & they shipped me a new set very quickly. New set was same size. Also, the side tables get very hot because there is little seperation from firebox. Finally, as other reviewer noted, the unit needs a back panel. It becomes a dirt collector very quickly & also does not let rainwater drain. Couldn't cost more than another $20 or so to add that. It does cook very evenly, but will take some time to get used to correct temp. settings."
1,broke in seconds.,I opened the box and pulled the net out only to hear it rip. it was rolled up and ripped as i unroled it.that says it all.
4,Paid a lot more at our local pond store.,Hey this is a pond net. Keeps the leaves & critters out of the pond. Last year bought the identical net at a local pond store for almost double the price. Usually by spring the net has deterioated too much to be reused so this works great ( it either sticks by being frozen to the rocks or ters when I pull it up.
4,It works!,This relaxative is very gentle and doesn't cause cramping. I use it on occasion to help get things going again.
1,Don't waste money on this one,"Recently I saw a revival of FLORA and loved it. I was fooled to buy the original version, and I can see why it closed after playing 87 performances. Minnelli might have been great on stage, but she is raw and shrill on this CD. FLORA has been redone in 1987, and it has better story and music! This CD is a waste of money -let it die in peace."
5,liza kander and ebb- the early years,WHat fun...bright brassy...at times it appears that liza may be auditioning for the road tour of funny girl. For shear energy and and fun show music..don't miss it. The last song has always seemed kind of lame to me...but hey....DO NOT mistake this for the 1987 revival- i love peter frechette...but its just not the same.
3,Early Kander & Ebb,"There are only three reasons to even consider purchasing this cd. One, it's Liza Minnelli pre-""Cabaret,"" and every once in a while you can hear her more familiar tones popping out. Second, it's one of the first musicals by the great songwriting team of Kander & Ebb, who would of course go on to a string of hits (and occasional flops), including CABARET, CHICAGO, and CURTAINS! Finally, although most of the music isn't even close to good, there are clever moments both in the music and lyrics. The plot itself is a bit dated, but it also gives a glimpse into the world of the songwriting team that would later find more dark subject matter to musicalize."
2,Best enjoyed by the wonks among us.,"The subject matter sounds interesting, but Holli's writing style is dry and plodding. Some of these mayors sound like interesting characters, but they don't come to life in this book. The leadership analysis at the end is for die-hards only. Though the book was promoted in general-interest news articles, it's not going to generate much enthusiasm outside the ivory tower."
1,10 worst mayors?,"Cleveland Mayor (now Congressman) Dennis Kucinich was one of the best & most fascinating ... not one of the worst.""There is little debate,"" wrote Cleveland Magazine in May 1996, ""over the value of Muny Light today. Now Cleveland Public Power, it is a proven asset to the city that between 1985 and 1995 saved its customers $195,148,520 over what they would have paid CEI."" Kucinich's move also preserved hundreds of union jobs. In 1998, city council granted Kucinich amnesty, stating that he had ""the courage and foresight to refuse to sell the city's municipal electric system."""
5,Def a favorite,This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies. The two main actors are just superb and have great chemistry. It also helps that both of these ridiculously good looking people also have great comedic talents.
4,"Finally, Two of My Faves!!!","IT'S ABOUT TIME! I have always wondered what a movie with these two in it would be like and now I know: UN-FREAKING BEEEEEEELIEVABLE!!!!! I can't put any words to it, but I will try. Rani, one of MY top 5 Bollywood actresses, has got it going on! And just when I think she has done it all, she pioneers the way into a different double role: ONE AS A MAN! And my boy Shahid... what a versatile actor! Although still charming, there was nothing, and I mean nothing, boyish about his performance in this film. I absolutely loved the excerpts from ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" and ""Hum Aapke Hain Koun"" in this movie because Rani and Shahid had as much chemistry as the duos of ""Shahrukh and Kajol"" and ""Salman and Madhuri."" And for the sports fan, there's some cricket playing in it, too, which is the base of the whole movie as Rani's character went into drag trying to fulfill her dream to be a batsman. SEE IT! GET IT! You won't be sorry. Trust me."
3,"All The Fluff, None of the Substance","I'll irritate people who love this movie, but I found it not just trite and unbelievable, but even condescending and mindless. No Indian woman as beautiful as Rani Mukherjee could ever hope to pass herself off as a boy. But the the director doesn't even have the guts to show her honestly in the reveal--suddenly her hair and makeup are perfect, as if we are not sophisticated enough to appreciate her in her unmade-up state. And don't tell me a crowd of Pakistani men would have bought into her little speach at the end. I'm not saying this movie can't be enjoyed--Mukherjee and Kapoor are both nice eye candy--just don't expect it to be in any way believable or meaningful."
3,YRF needs a better concept,"Oh don't get me wrong. It was funny, lively, and entertaining. It was not-however-amazing. I had sky high expectations. The music is great and Shahid and Rani are perfect. It's not a movie like Kaminey. Its story has no substance. Kher's idea of making Rani make Shahid fall in love with her is completely out of the blue. Try to see it once for the chemistry and music.7/10"
3,Great but misnamed,Contains fantastic photos. A little to 'Photoshopped' for my taste but great. The only problem I had with the book is that it contains no actual panoramic images. Many are wide angle but nothing that fits the definiton of panoramic.
2,Pictures nice but book fell apart.,"The pictures in this book are really beautiful. However, the spine of the book was not intact when I got it. The pages started to fall out after a week."
3,Promise of Happiness,"It took a couple of chapters to get into it, but was a good read. Families can be very dynamic and this family is. They stick together and help one another."
4,A Good Family Saga for a Long Weekend,"While I enjoyed Justin Cartwright's award winning ""The Promise Of Happiness"" very much, I was bothered that there wasn't much ANGER expressed at JuJu for the wrong doing (yes, her crime) that resulted in her incarceration. Her family make a lot of excuses for her, and other than one moment that might have been the result of illness, she is never taken to task for her part in the scheme. Maybe this is something ""British"" that I don't ""get"" as an American, but if it had been me, my parents and siblings would have been vocally angry - even if they would have eventually also come to forgiveness."
3,"Oversized, but does the trick","These gloves are huge! By that I mean the punching surface is huge. I have rather small hands and they fit fine from inside, but they are definitely well-cusioned. I'm not sure what the little cushioned point between the thumb and the rest of the hand is for; maybe it's just to round the shape out a little or protect your hand from knife-edge strikes.I use these gloves exclusively on a 60lb vinyl punching bag (so far). I have made lots of hit lower on the bag where the sand inside is packed and it didn't hurt much at all. You definitely can tell it's packed sand, though, so maybe it's best not to throw your hardest punches on that part of a sand bag. I've only been using the gloves for over a month so I wouldn't expect wear to be an issue. So far it isn't. Amazon has a good price on these."
2,Not a good buy,"We bought this phone yesterday and are returning it today. There ample features, the phone is sleek and the size compact but THAT IS NOT THE POINT. All you want a cordless to do is have good voice quality and battery life. I can't speak for the battery life (Consumer Reports states 13 hours but they also reported good voice quality, so go figure) but the voice quality is poooooor. Granted we live in an apartment and there may be alot of interference but I can't justify spending $... for a phone that does not handle the basics. White noise in every conversation and the answering machine message is inaudible. Going to give the Panasonic 2730s and will write a review for that one as well.Trust me. . . Don't buy this phone unless you want ..."
2,static,"After reading many favorable reviews, I decided to purchase this phone. After using it, I'm sending it back. I've moved this phone to many different locations in order to get rid of the constant waves of static coming from the receiver, but nothing worked. I have two 900MHz phones that were under sixty bucks that work better than this phone. Unless you like static, do not buy this phone!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I should have listened to all the negative reviews I read before purchasing this item. However, it was the top rated exapandable cordless by Good Housekeeping magazine so I fell for it. I purcased the base and one handset. The base phone was defective and would not hold a charge. The additional handset charged very quickly and we used it for a day and heard the annoying ""white noise"" so many reviewers mentioned. It would not go away no matter where we were in the house. I returned it and exchanged it for the Panasonic comparable model(#KX-TG1050N). It was more expensive,but we are very happy with it and do not experience the interference. I should have remembered a prior VTECH cordless phone we owned did not perform well and we replaced that one with a Panasonic. Save yourself the hassle and just go for the Panasonic."
1,Died 1 week after the warranty ended,"I bought this because I have 2 rooms that need phones and I don't want to bother with running wire to them - so I have handsets for them.The sound quality has been great, I haven't had any of the sound problems that others report.Now, 1 week after a year (the warranty period), the answering machine has died - the LED displays ""--"" and flashes on and off. The worst part about this is that it makes a clicking sound that can be heard on the handset.Now I have to decide if I want to keep my 'investment' (2 other handsets) alive and buy another 2461 or a 2431 (if so I may buy the extended warranty)...or put it to bed."
1,Disappointed!,"After purchasing this phone, both for it's good looks and answering machine, I was very very disappointed that it was of such poor quality considering it's high price. 1. As you've read here, the sound quality is worse than a cell phone. 2. The answering machine would not record many of my incoming calls, probably due to the poor sound. After taking it back to the store, the salesperson told me Vtech phones are known for being poor quality. Too bad they can't fix these problems - the phone itself looks great!"
2,Great When it worked!!,"I had this phone for about a year when I experienced the same problems others had noted, the 2 flashing ""- -"". I went through the whole routine with Vtech's tech support, they finally had me return it for a warranty repair, this was great except that I was without an answering machine for 3 weeks! The replacement has worked for about 6 months and is doing the same thing again. Don't waste your time on this system - there are other systems out there that are just as good and a lot more reliable!!"
2,Not one of VTech's better efforts....,"This manufacturer of excellent telephones stumbled with this model. I disregarded Consumer Report's comments that there is a persistent white noise in the background, but CU was correct. Despite all of the excellent features, small size and price, it's simply not a good phone. Also, the VTech customer support is dreadful. When I needed to purchase an extra battery cover, I was told that there weren't any available, but to try calling them again in a month or so. Customer support, indeed!"
2,"Great Look, Great Features Horrid Performance","In an effort to find a new phone/Answering system combo, I purchased this unit. It had every feature you could want, great looks, tons a features, reminded me of my cell phone the way the phone directory works along with many other features, but when it came to actually talking on the phone it also reminded me of my cell phone. I was severly disapointed there was a constant static in the phone that never went away no matter how close to the base and gets even louder when the handset volume is increased. The range was really bad my old 900mhz went farther with less static. Living in an apartment I need range and clarity this phone doesn't provide that. It's unfortunant because it's really cool looking, great feal and has a lot of neat features. I ended up taking this phone back and opted for the reliable panasonic which was $20 more but definately worth it, the range on that phone is unreal."
2,Disappointing Sound Quality,"I was excited to get this system (2461 + 3 extra handsets). I thought there were lots of great features -- good ergonomics, the ability to intercom among handsets, good battery life, etc.All the good features were overwhelmed, however, by the very poor sound quality. People thought I was on a cell phone, and in some rooms of the house, it was almost impossible to have an intelligble conversation. I'm reluctantly returning it -- I tried for almost a month to make it work -- and trying something lower tech."
2,Fair phone... but annoying at times,"I have had this phone for over a year now (multiple handsets as well). In general it has worked out ok. Every so often though (once a week), when you go to answer the phone it will lose contact with the base, and then it has to reacquire the base (takes about a minute). While that is happening, the caller just gets dead air and probably hangs up. Can be quite annoying, and it happens often enough to be a concern. The other complaint I have is that you have to traverse menus to adjust the volume on the handset. I liked the design and look of the phone, but I think I would rather have an ugly phone that works more reliably."
2,"White Noise, UGH!",I just bought this phone and discovered much to my annoyance that it doesn't matter where you put the base you get static. It is irritating to say the least. This over-priced phone will be heading back were I purchased it.
1,"very unhappy with purchase, item does not even power up properly","not happy with purchase at all, item was advertised as working refurbished and it did not even power up properly"
1,Poor sound quality. My old 900mhz was a better phone.,"The Vtech looks nice and has really cool functions, but the problem is that the sound quality is really bad and choppy. Also is has lesser range than the Panasonic 2.4 Ghz phones. In fact, my old 900 mhz phone has better sound quality and greater range than the Vtech. Please do not buy this phone...it was a complete waste of money. I had to sell the phone (with the 3 additional handsets) on auction just to get rid of it. Vtechs only look nice...but thats about it."
2,Billy Walker-20 Greatest Hits,"I bought this CD to get a few of his MGM hits that I did not have. However, I discovered when I compared the tracks hereon with the original Columbia and Monument hits that I have, this is a rerecording of Billy's hits. The rerecordings are of high quality but they just are not the original hits. As a result, I was disappointed because a couple of reviewers had indicated otherwise. I would recommend instead Billy Walker Columbia Hits and Billy Walker Greatest Hits On Monument for original recordings and in the meantime I will look for another CD that has his original hits from his MGM and RCA recordings made between 1970 and 1976."
5,Old country favorite;,"Since 'Billy Walker' passed on , it's hard to get any C.D.'s with his original recordings on it. I went to some big box retailers and there all out of stock. Glad to find it on ""Amazon""."
2,Well-made but not for someone with wide sit-bones.,"I really wanted to like the saddle as it looks to be well-made, and for many of my friends they will ride nothing else. For me it is easily the least comfortable saddle I have ever ridden. The issue is that for someone with wide sit bones you end up riding on the little metal rails that suspend the leather and not the suspended part of the seat. If I try to sit forward on the seat my sit-bones miss it entirely. This makes the seat unrideable after about 3 miles. I gave it 2 stars because I know it works for many but for me it was a waste of $200. Defiantly try before you buy."
3,Uneven,"I cannot quite make up my mind about this book. I definitely liked many aspects of it, but a good deal of it also spoiled my feeling anything more than a mild liking (at best) for it. I think it was spoiled for me from the point, very early on, where Amelia mistook Andreas for a Catholic priest. I just could not think any girl could be that ignorant. Well perhaps it just shows how ignorant the English were about Catholics - but it seemed slightly unbelievable that she believed him to be a priest simply because he wore black. So her continued belief during this initial portion of their relationship, made her even appear even sillier. She just seemed to enjoy feeling superior to him as regards money as well and thus her character seemed shallow."
2,Made of Plastic,"Save your money. The picture looks great, but when you receive the item the balls on the ends are made of Grey Plastic. They look really cheap."
3,Lots of Yin but no Yang,"Worth reading, but sometimes a chore to get through, especially the first few chapters (too wordy). The story really gets moving once we reach Persia, but the rest of the story is hampered by almost dismissive battle scenes and I felt the romance between the narrator and the persian woman was pointless and included in only because the author felt it obligatory. Also, one doesn't really get a feeling of time's passage or exactly what is happening to the men. Mr. Ford has a knack for beautiful storytelling (a few haunting moments, particularly with the leper girl), but he could take a few lessons from Robert E. Howard. This is, after all, a war story. Still, a worthy first effort"
1,"A weak and disjointed ""me too"" Gates of Fire","I am amazed by some of these reviews. Anyone comparing this with Gates of Fire must have some other motive. (A better comparison is Pressfiled's much weaker book about Alcibiades). This novel creates and abandons plot elements (the Boetian engines, for example) en masse and the ending is abrupt and highly unsatisfactory. The rest of the Anabasis may have been boring but isn't a novelization supposed to fix that? He'd made up enough silly relationship material... he could have easily had those elements be part of the last part of the book. Seems to me that Huck Finn on the river would have been described as ""not worth novelizing"" by some ot these reviewers. If you must buy it, you can have mine as it'll be on ebay asap."
3,Not too exciting,"This is not a terrible book, but not too exciting either. As far as historical fiction goes, the novel stays very close to the original ""Anavasis"" and does a fairly accurate job of representing the realities of the time.However the book is generally uninspired. It's almost all history and no fiction. Nor does it attempt to elaborate and explain in any creative way the story of the 10,000. Cliches notwithstanding, the story does not really ""come to life"". It is simply ""told"".If you like the genre, you should much rather read the amazing Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield, the authoritative historical fiction on classical Greece."
4,A new voice for an old tale,"Though I'm not much older than someone who has graduated from High School, I found this tale rather more inciteful than studying the Greek Literature. Michael Ford's first book has made this tale easier to swallow than reading ""Theo's"" old text. If you read this book, it at least gives you an idea of who Xenophon was through the expedition. A very realistic approach of what happened since most Greek literature I read has something to do with Sirens, immortals, and great heroes who can butcher 50 people without suffering a blow."
5,"Review: 100,000",I was very satisfied with the delivery and packaging of this time and the book is in excellent condition! I'm looking forward to reading this book again - it definitely belongs on my bookshelf!
3,"Great Writing, Wrapped up too quick","Michael Curtis Ford's writing was incredible. It brought Xenophon and his time to life. The build up of the march and all the twist and turns to the story made for a fast paced and fun read. My frustration with this novel is where Mr. Ford chose to end his telling of this ancient tale. I was left dissapointed when it ended. Of course the excellent writing kept me wanting to read more, but the story itself just ended. It was as if we were on deadline or bored with this story. All this detail and suspense was built up, captivating me as a reader, then the story ends and I was given a two page wrap up of the main character. That was my biggest dissapointment. While other compare him to Pressfield, I am not so convinced and still consider Mr. Pressfield the master. I truley enjoyed the first 417 pages of this novel. The last 22 left a lot to be desired."
3,In ten thousand words or less,"I am conflicted regarding Mike Ford's ""Ten Thousand"". Overall I liked the book. It tries hard to be ""Gates of Fire"" but never quite reaches that level of quality.The first part of the book is the best, describing the march into Persia, the Battle of Cunaxa, the death of Cyrus and the election of Xenophon as general. In addition, you get a real feel of the extent of the hardships and deprivation the army was forced to endure in their truely epic march to safety.Where I feel the book falls short is its portrait of Xenophon himself. He doesn't come across as a character of the strength and depth necessary to lead an army in such dire circumstances. Also, the love story between Theo and Asteria I found extremely dull. And Theo himself comes in a poor second to ""Gates"" Xeo.Overall, however, if you love historical ficition as I do you will enjoy reading ""The Ten Thousand""."
5,Would probably make a great Monty Python Movie!,"Yes! I enjoyed the book but then if you've bought it, you have too. So what are you waiting for? Buy it."
3,Epic Greek Historical Fiction,"It is 400 BC in the realm of the eastern Mediterranean. Athens is in pieces after a devastating war, while Sparta stands triumphant. But our journey does not begin within the rich tapestry of ancient Greece, but further east into unknown Persia. In the town of Sardis, within the satrapy of Lydia, the young philosopher-warrior Xenophon is about to embark on a most historic mission.Under the orders of the young prince Cyrus of Persia, Xenophon is to travel into the harsh deserts with ten thousand men in an effort to take over all of Persia, giving Cyrus full reign over this arid land. What Xenophon does not know is that the journey will take many lives, covering a thousand miles, and involve a momentous battle. As to who will win, you will have to read the book to find out.Originally published on December 3rd 2001.For over 500 more book reviews and free author interviews, go to the BookBanter site ([...])"
3,Dramatic story of survival in ancient times,"This account of Xenophon and the ten thousand Greek mercenaries who found themselves without a patron in the middle of ancient Persia is a great story well told. I would have preferred if the author had not used the device of telling the story through the thoughts a common soldier. I don't understand why Michael Curtis Ford and Steven Pressfield find this technique so compelling - for they always use it. Why not speak from the main protaganist's point of view or, better yet, from the author's point of view?"
4,"Good story, characters","This was a well told story, kind of the good parts version of the actual campaign. I decided to read this when I came upon it at the library. As I totally enjoyed Gates of Fire, this was a necessary and natural follow up. If you are interested in ancient battles, especially Greek, this is a good choice for you."
4,It works,"I read this eleven years ago and since then have given it to three friends. All I can say is, it worked. There was practical ""how to"" advice."
2,worrisome,"I have to admit I haven't read this book. Reading the available excerpt I found much common-sense advice, until the part about putting your infant to sleep on his stomach. This is dangerously outdated advice - used to be the accepted practice until about 15 years ago (the copyright is 1985!) when research showed much higher rates of SIDS (crib death) in babies sleeping on their stomachs. This makes me concerned about whether the other info is similarly outdated - babies' sleep needs haven't changed much in 20 years, but safety recommendations have."
1,Huge Disappointment,"We bought this book to help us with a three month old who's got some bad sleeping habits (probably because of us!) I was expecting some solid answers to our baby's sleeping problems and was instead presented with a book full of wordy rhetoric and philosphophies, and NO hard answers or tips for babies who are MORE than a few days/weeks old.The book categorizes by age group ""birth to 4 months"", etc. making it difficult for us to follow guidelines that according to the book should have been established from day one. If first time parents KNEW they were going to have sleep problems with their newborns that would continue for months, they would find this book useful. For those of us without that foresight, this book leaves you cold."
4,Give it a try,"If you can't handle your child crying alone for more than a few minutes, this book is not for you. However, if you are willing to give it a try your efforts will pay off ten-fold. We are now parents of a 3 year old and a 1 year old, both of which have been sleeping on their own and through the night since they were 2 months old. At the first sign of a yawn and eye-rub, we're off to bed... no fuss...no muss. They grab their 'big bear' or 'blankie', roll-over and put themselves to sleep. Meanwhile, my husband and I are well rested, happier and less-stressed out parents. It takes about a week, and the schedule was all set. In will admit, the suggestions in this book are not very 'in'...it seems more old-school, which I like. The book addresses sleeping problems which might crop up as they grow - I use it as a reference guide when we are approaching a new phase in their development - the move to a big boy bed, arrival of a new baby, etc. Give it a try...it worked for us."
1,"Incomplete, inadequate and erroneous","A book on Civil War generals that doesn't include Pat Cleburne? John Bell Hood (b.1831-d.1879) said in the book to have died ""four years"" after the war? An ""encyclopedia"" on individuals that frequently ommits places and dates of births and deaths? The Civil War Society, author of this book, should be embarrased."
4,Excellent taste poor package,"I am very pleased by the great improvement in taste of gluten free cookies. Even people who can eat wheat like these cookies. Unfortunately rice based baked goods require a more protective package when honey or molasses is not prominent in the recipe. Cookie tins lined with corrugated cardboard that have crinkled paper cups provide some protection from shock, and should be used instead of thin plastic wrap. Makers need to be aware that many gluten sensitive people don't have local stores that carry special foods, and pack for shipping by mail. Click on my reviews to see more on this packing issue with gluten free shortbread cookies by Pamela."
3,recieved quickly,"I purchased these for my daughter and bought several boxes worth, I received them very quickly, but when I unpacked them, several of the packages were damaged and crushed, this is the second time this has occured."
4,A good CD filled with hits.,"Who said that a former undertaker can't make it big in country music? Well, John Conlee made it! If you only purchase one John Conlee CD--make it this one. The title cut is sad (yet truthful) and I found myself humming it long after I had turned of my CD player. Probably the biggest hit from this lineup is Conlee's ""Backside of Thirty"" which I think will appeal to any man who's approaching 40 or who has been there. ""I'll Be Easy"" is a fun, light-sounding song and ""Lady Lay Down"" was heard a lot on the radio in the early 80s. This CD will surely bring back some memories--try it!"
3,"So cheesy, so good.","I have a dirty little secret - I love this album. I know, I know. It's fluffy 70's country, with string sections and a mix that seems to have been done by someone with a tin ear. The songs are all sappy, maudlin and so very, very fun. Conlee is mostly forgotten except when it comes time for those compilation shows where they run ""best songs of"". But the guy had a great voice, and it shows on this CD.This isn't outlaw country, but it isn't supposed to be. And it is as cutting edge as a Barney record. But play a few songs and let yourself sink into the warm voice, the wildly overproduced (or lush) background and I think you will revel in the heartfelt schmaltz."
4,Uplifting and Meditative,"I was first intoduced to this CD in a yoga class~ perfect music for that! Lots of drums and new-agey twists, the Cantor's voice is amazing. This is very spiritual and very alive. Great music to wake up with or have other peaceful time with."
3,Great product but could be better,"I have a small 9 lb tabby cat and a huge 20 lb black cat. The litter box does a great job of reducing smell and though the re-fill is expensive they make the litter box very easy to clean. Great if you're pregnant and can't touch litter. Both cats got used to it in days. It's too small for my big cat to fit in well, but he can if the hood is off. The cons are that it's too small. It is full in about 5 days with two cats using it and the cost of the re-fill is upsetting. The crystals that come with the re-fills are cheep knockoffs that soil too easy. I also buy extra litter and clean it once a week. I can usually use the disposable box twice before the cats totally soil it."
4,Fantastic,"Yes, the cartridges are expensive, but completely worth it. This never gets jammed like the Litter Maid. With one cat, cartridges last about 3.5 weeks. I'll never go back to regular litter!"
4,Worked for me,"I have five very large cats( 15 lbs). I have a litter robot, costly but fabulous. When they grew larger some of the cats grew to dislike the litter robot(claustrophobic?) I got this on sale and order a lot of refills online. Now everybody is happy, particularly me; no muss, no fuss, no smell."
3,ok movie,"Nice message to this movie, however, the kids didn't seem to like it near as well as ""jingle Bells"" or ""Annabel's Wish"""
1,Best way to describe this book is BRUTAL...,"So, I am in my second class of assembly first was a basic overview of z80 6800 8080 and so on.. It was not bad fairly easy to understand and was written by Malvino and Brown. Now this class, I feel dumber for reading this book... have to admit I am only on chapter 8 but I had to go back to the Malvino Brown Digital Computer Electronics book just to get my head straight again. The review saying it took 2 pages just to review Hex to Dec is right on, but how about spending no time explaining counting bytes/bits, and examples that simply provide opcode not programs... terrible. I should not have to buy more books just to understand what this book is trying to say. I know assembly is not this tough. This book makes it tough."
5,Why memorize it? Understand it!,"This is an outstanding book for those that love programming and architecture. With an abundance of exercises, and writing that's easy and fun to read, understanding the material is surprisingly easy! The book teaches assembly language and interfacing/architecture. A few example exercises are Building a single board computer, modem, graphics controller and even an oscilloscope! Don't worry, the book eases up to these challenges. The final word? Buy this book!"
2,So-So,"I bought this as a replacement for my Delta twin laser after a fire took out my shop. I'm probably biased toward my old Delta (not made anymore). First off the manual is terrible. It is flimsy and made of thin paper (even covers) so don't expect it to last long. The set-up information does not cover everything. The unit is louder than I remember from my Delta. The blade guard works, but is very flimsy and wobbly. I know I was spoiled on my twin laser; but that being said.......this unit's laser disappears when the blade is half-way lowered. The laser will not ""wrap"" around to the front of the board to be cut like the Delta. So when doing a miter the laser will not show on the front edge. Only on the top. Yes I miss my Delta, but since this unit cost about the same I expected it to be close. Getting it set up for accurate cuts (I use it for woodworking) is hard. I don't think the fences are completely flat and paralleled."
4,Great Map Poor Shipping,The map took over a month to get here and when it did it came in a box 5 times its size and was damaged. The map itself is great just don't see why it took over a month to get when every book store has them. Who ever is in chage of shipping for Amazon needs to find a new job or learn how to pack boxes.
1,"This cd is half great, and half bust","What a pleasant surpise we have here. Susannah has a great voice! Susannah sure does sing beautifully on this cd.The real problem I have with this cd is in the instrumentation. Whoever the musical director was for this project should be fired. This is a jazz cd, but that doesn't mean that the music on this cd shouldn't have some melody to it. On most the songs there was no true melody. Susannah needs a new band. Susannah has too much talent to waste on projects like this.I currently own all of the S.M. catalog and would like to say that there are other cds by Susannah that are much better than this cd.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
2,"Works as advertised, but very SLOW...",This is an amazing product in what it is able to do. Unfortunately the OSX version is too slow to really be usable for any real work. I'm running on a G4/867Mhz and don't have near the performance I did in OS9. Hopefully version 5.1 will be faster...
2,Don't bother to upgrade,"I upgraded from VPC 3.0 hoping the upgrade would get me better performance, and I'd be able to migrate to OS X. I have a Blue & White G3/300 MHz/256 MB RAM.VPC 5.0 barely runs under OS X, although to Connectix's credit, they recommend 350 MHz+. Perhaps if I had a faster CPU and more memory, things might be better. For now though, it looks like running VPC in OS X is out. In OS 9, I find the older version runs faster in all aspects.Both of my objectives (OS X migration and better performance) were not met. If you have an older G3 like me, don't bother to upgrade. It's a step in the wrong direction."
5,"Great Series, Great Book","This whole series was just fantastic. I started out reading Robert Doherty's Area 51 series (who in fact is Greg Donegan and vice versa), and I couldn't stop reading it. This series was just as good. The ending battle scene was a bit too short and abrupt. It could have been drawn out and described in more detail and excitement as the other two historical battles of this book were (gettysburg and isandlwana). But overall the book was great and the series as a whole was fantastic. What can I say, Donegan just writes great stories. Pretty cool who the Shadow turned out to be also."
2,Proof read please?,"I've read many of Bob Mayer's books before and enjoyed them. I am half way through the Gate series and it's a good read BUT the proof reading is non-existent and it effects the readability of the text greatly in some places. I don't know if it's Mr. mayer's, fault or Amazon's bit it's not acceptable. It's so bad on occasions that it takes 3-4 read throughs to understand what's actually being written. I don't care that this is an ebook format, no-one paying for a book should have to accept that poor level of quality. You certainly wouldn't with a printed copy. Proof read before publishing please!"
5,Atlantis Series,I really like this whole series. As I live in Florida I always knew our last hopes would be coming from the ocean.
4,If you've read Assault on Atlantis then you've read this...,"It had been a few months since I read the last book in the series. So when I picked this up and started reading about the earth being in trouble because of the lack of ozone and the radiation in Russia I thought I had picked up the wrong book and was reading it again. I had to hop around a bit to realize it is the same story as Assualt on Atlatis; but told from different perspectives. I thought it was better than Assault on Atlantis in that regards however, there was very little new stuff (which I'm not sure the last book left room for anyways) but I think the author could have combined these last 2 books and made one good series ending book. There is stuff covered in the last book that is not covered here, however of the two I think this one is better."
1,Lousy piece of software!!!! BEWARE!!!,"I am a recent Mac convert. I have used Windows machines for many, many years. When I bought my IMac, I had heard about this program and was very excited...just think the best of both worlds, OS X and Windows XP Home. I plunked down my hard-earned ... and boy am I disappointed. THIS SOFTWARE IS BEYOND SLOW!!!! The documentation is lacking, the installation took several hours, and I now remember why I switched to a Mac in the first place. Believe me when I say, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DO. IT IS MUCH, MUCH TOO SLOW TO BE OF ANY USE."
1,Crap!!!,"This makes absolutely no sense! Because the DVD is for another region, it will not play in our DVD player. I bought the only one and can't even watch it! This is wrong! Wrong on all levels. I work hard for my money and it angers me that I can't return it, I trusted Amazon to warn me about these thing and they let me down. This was my first bad experience with online shopping I am so disappointed and will never order off-line again."
2,Okay for cats.,It is not as sharp as I would hope. My dog is only 15 lbs. I am having a little trouble to cut his nails with this.
3,its ok,they work good for my smaller puppy for a while but you really have to clip them hard for it to cut all the way through.
3,it is okay,"This product is okay. I bought them because they were inexpensive, they're not as sharp as I'd like, but honestly they do their job/ I use them on very tiny dogs and it works just fine."
3,"I would have appreciated a ""HOW"" segment","This is a good book if you already know how to do the suggested exercises, but I was sort of lost without diagrams or pictures. This book is organized situationally, that is, it gives you exercises to do in certain situations, like at the office or in the car...you get the picture.I was looking for something a bit more instructive, not how to squeeze exercise into a busy day. I have a set time for that.Still and all, the book delivers what it purports to deliver: If you have trouble fitting exercise into your life, then this is a good book. If, like me you're trying to get ideas for exercises, with diagrams and whatnot, then keep looking."
4,If you are serious about weight control,"Weight control - maintaining it or losing it - requires three things: time, increase of calorie expenditure, and reduction of calorie intake.You didn't put all of those pounds on in one year - you won't loose them for good in one year either. Think 5 to 10 years - you do plan to be around that long, don't you?Ms Price's book shows you how to gradually, but permanently, come to burn more calories in your day to day life. The Anytime, Anywhere Exercise Book is a portal to enduring weight control through a more active lifestyle. Pick an exercise that fits your current activities. Two months later, add a second. Soon you are looking for and finding ways to strengthen your body, heart, and burn calories. No, you will not be using all 300 of her suggestions.For the third component, reduction of calorie intake, look elsewere."
5,A little humor along with exercise tips,"I just got this book yesterday and I am really enjoying it. I didn't expect it to be so funny! (I always like a bit of humor along with my exercises.) I am an aerobics instructor so I read a lot of exercise books. I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorites.I think I'll just go and ""floss"" my thighs now..."
5,Joan Price Does it Again,"I have all of Joan's books, because she actually makes exercise fun, but this may be my favorite. I kept thinking I was too busy to exercise and have instead found that I can add together exercise ""minutes"" to make up a great fitness program. Who knew I'd be exercising in the shower with my wash cloth???? P.S. This book is my new favorite gift item. I bought it as a birthday gift and for both mothers and fathers day gifts, and everyone loves it."
1,waste of money,"I was very disappointed in this book. There are no illustrations at all, and the descriptions are not that great. If you want a really good muscle toning/sculpting book, buy David Kirsch's, ""Sound Mind, Sound Body"". It is beautifully illustrated with plenty of exercises that can be done without equipment. He breaks it down by body part, and offers basic and advanced versions of the exercise. His book is worth the money!"
5,Art Review,"When one thinks of 20th century art, the countries Spain, France, USA,England, even Germany and Holland will probably come to mind. Portugal isunlikely to be thought of. In fact you are probably hard-pressed to think ofeven one modern Portugese artist, which is a shame really, as there is a lotof vibrant art being produced there.Part of the problem is that there is little in the way of books on Portugesemodern Art.This book is the exception. It covers more than 2,000 artists in the period1900 to 1974, and is organized as a biographical dictionary. As a referencework on modern Portugese art, this book has no competitors. The informationon each artist is factual, avoiding opinion and value judgement. Half thebook is given over to photos of the works, including almost 100 colorplates.If you are planning on visiting any galleries on your trip to Portugal, thisbook will be most useful, or if you simply want to explore a little knownarea of modern art, I would recommend it."
2,AVOID: Fake stereo!!,"The music is fantastic, no doubt about it. But they used a fake stereo tape to master this from! It makes no sense, since Atlantic was recording on an 8-track Ampex since the '50s. They goofed big time with this CD."
4,Instrumentally Ray,"This is an excellent album--totally instrumental and some great jazz. Mostly Ray at the piano, but also some great sax, etc. from other famous members of his group at the time. This is early stuff---(c) 1961 on the Atlantic label. I found this album on vinyl in the cut-out bin 25 years ago--one of my best bargains ever."
5,ZEKE YOU,"This is thee Zeke record to get-- 100% Octane fuelled Rawk and Rule, like Motorhead possessed by the Devil himself (or his minions of rowdy and sadistic Dwarves). I think Endino did the recording of this, to which he brings all the filth and fury to the fore.... ""Flat Tracker"" and ""Super Sound Racing"" are O.K., but merely overtures that hinted at this masterpiece of unrelenting mayhem."
1,Zeke has no talent in playing instruments!!!!!!!,"Zeke can not carry a tune. This guy has a really terrible voice, and I don't think that they know how to play instruments. They make epitaph records look bad."
5,Great disc golf bag,This as an inexpensive alternative to other disc-golf specific bags this size. It has nearly all the same essential inside and outside pockets handy for DG gear and has room for about 25 discs. The fastener rings for the shoulder band can be used with quad shock straps. The only thing missing are the $7 disc holder inserts.
1,Boring,"comon. this book is the least bit entertaining. i couldnt stop daydreaming while reading this book. i tried to read the book...but my mind just kept wandering off onto other things(more exciting things). the main character isnt expressed very well. its a matter of ""he did this"" ""we walked there"" etc...."
4,My daughter loved it so much she took it!,This is really a nice fragrance and the bottle is very pretty. It is a little hard to open. This turned out to be a little youthful for me but my daughter loved it. The price really couldn't be beat.
5,incredible,"Huver is one of my favorite bands right now. Their great first EP, ""Wheatland EP"" just scratches the surface of this great band. They have some even better songs that will hopefully be on the way."
5,Can't wait for an entire cd!!!,"This group sounds like they have unlimited patential, look for Huver to be a stand out group in the near future, that's if they stay with the same quality of songs. I recommend this cd to everyone, that is unless you can find it on the internet and burn it."
4,great little record.....,"As far as new music goes, I usually don't waist alot of my time. But for a new band, and a new set of songs, I belive that this is worth mentioning. The recordings are great, the performances are great, guitars are refressing, melodic, as well as the vocals. The music is fresh, and yet radio friendly, but not the kind of radio friendly that we all get sooo sick of hearing. This is only a 5 song EP, used to showcase this new bands music, but its for sure worth a buy. Its exciting for us to get a sneek peek as to whats around the corner when a full length record is released from this new band."
1,Archive Paisley Prints Only,"This book is only the archival paisley reproduction plates. There is no history nor narrative. I thought that there would be some ""discussion"". If I realized that it was only the historic plates, I would not have purchased it."
4,how to attract and retain top IT workers,"At the start of this decade, this book tried to look at problems related to Information Technology, at the university level in the US. One of these is the supply of qualified people. While a university might do some training, the preparation of such people is also a function of primary and secondary schools. And a university has to compete to attract IT workers in the face of often more attractive offers from industry. Where this might be in terms of a company being able to dangle a higher salary or stock options.One recommendation is that a university maintain flexible and updated job qualifications. Vital in responding quickly to IT changes. Other recommendations are also discussed."
1,Bad Idea,I should have known not to buy shoes without trying them on. The fit was way off. I'll never buy shoes online again.
5,Excellent,Those who only know Peter Appleyard from his work with Benny Goodman (and I am one of them) will be amazed by his versatility and the cohesion of the musicians he chose for this date.
5,A Great Resource!,"Spontaneous Melodramas is a great reasource for any church youth group! We love ""acting out"" these neat skits and we learn from them too. The skits are made so that youth groups of most any size can incorporate them. A great way to incorporate the youth. A great tool."
3,"Fascinating Subject, But Book Could Be Better","I did enjoy Tinniswood's book and found the subject very intriguing. The Great Fire of London was incredibly dramatic and Tinniswood shines when he brings in primary sources such as the diary of Samuel Pepys and the poetry of the time. I also appreciated the maps that tracked the progress of fire as well as other city plans and artwork included in the plates. Another strong point of the book is the discussion of the English fear of ""papism""; the 17th century mind equated Catholicism with a loss of liberty, which is something I hadn't heard of before.That being said, I found Tinniswood's writing style to be less than dynamic. The book does read quickly due to the subject matter, but I wouldn't call it great literature in and of itself. I would also have liked more historical background on the Restoration to help place the event in context. This book was worth the time to read, but this book is, for me, one to borrow rather than add to my personal library."
2,Should have been much better,"It's hard to take a fascinating historical subject like this and make it boring, but that's exactly what Tinniswood does with this book. He does a very, very poor job of setting the scene and introducing characters -- if you don't already know a lot about 17th century life and the geography of London, you'll likely find yourself lost. His extremely dry writing style doesn't help matters, either.The book also suffers from a lack of depth -- it's fact after fact with almost no attempt made at interpretation. And the lack of detail when compared to other books about historical fires (such as Von Drehle's ""Triangle"") is disappointing. Still, Tinniswood clearly has a very good knowledge of this interesting subject, and that's what keeps me from giving this book 1 star."
4,Awesome for playing with a one-year old,This was great for my grandson who loves bubbles. It makes lots and lots of bubbles. The downside is he could't hold it himself. It needs to operated by an adult and is kind of messy. Fun though!
4,Reliable bubble blower.,I purchased this for my 2yr. old daughter. She loves it. It produces a steady supply of bubbles. I do wish the bubble solution well in front was larger. It's well worth the $$. Thanks.
1,Is not working the way it should,"I think this toy would be awesome if it worked properly. The air coming out of Nemo's mouth is not strong enough. Therefore, it blows one bubble and it pops! My friend has one and her's works great! Can this be replaced?"
2,wrong direction,"Saw this band live in 1994, when it seemed they were having fun just playing and playing. On this album, over-production, pretense. On the first few albums there was guileless style to the music - now it seems there is overwrought feel to the music. Perhaps 'Lost in Nashville Production Values' should be the title of this album."
2,A great album.,"These guys get better with every outing, and this album is terrific. I haven't stopped playing it since I got it. The vocals are clear, and the harmonies are a thrill. Plus they sound like they are having fun, not always true with groups who re-form. There is no one who does toe-tapping honky tonk like the Mavericks, and there are some great cuts on this album. Buy it."
1,I can't believe I bought this CD on the above reviews account !,"AVOID AVOID AVOID !This is soup music at its worst, there's so much good music and talented people around, do not waste time and money and DO listen to the excerpts online prior to buying ... I did warn you !"
5,Great Tunes.,"As an avid Mavericks fan, I was unsure of how I felt about this CD. However, the more I listened, the more I loved it. Raul Malo's voice is the best. I wouldn't classify this as country; easy listening is a better ""label"". Try it, you'll like it. It will definitely grow on you."
3,Typical Mavericks,"Don't get me wrong, The Mavericks is one of my favorite groups and I listen to them more than anyone else. I love their songs and their ways of playing. This CD gets only three stars because it brings to the table nothing more than a typical, though solid, Mavericks CD. Longtime fans should be able to tell you what is there: a fast-paced strong tune made for turning up loud, a Latiny-sounding tune, a couple of I-can-sing-Sinatra-songs-too tunes, a cover of an old standby, a song that sounds country, etc. Once again...I love Raul Malo's voice and the things this band does. I will listen to this latest effort again and again, but I think that Trampoline and Music For All Occasions will get more play time. I hope this didn't sound too negative, because I want to end with...WELCOME BACK, GUYS, AND THANKS!"
5,Amazing!,"The Mavericks are back! So far, I could say this is their best work ever. I bought it without reading any previous reviews and I was not dissapointed, you will not be either!"
2,Sounds like someone copying the Mavericks,"All the Mavericks elements are there--great technique by the musicians, great singing from Raul Malo, clever pop hooks, references to American music forms past--especially country, soul, and Tex-Mex--faithful cover (""All I Need"") that makes you want to listen to the original. But the songwriting just isn't up to the Mavericks usual high standard. I feel like I've heard all the progressions before, the words don't tell me a whole lot, even the hooks sound like they've come from somewhere else. Not a bad album--it is the Mavericks, after all. But, just like Malo's solo album, this is more effect and polish than substance. Too bad, because I think the Mavericks are one of the best bands around today."
1,Run for your life,"I don't know how all of these people are saying ""typical Mavericks"" and stuff like that. It sounds nothing like the Mavericks used to. Where's the catchy tunes? The harmonies just aren't the same. I can't find a song that I like on this album. Their self-titled CD & What a Crying Shame are 2 of my favorite albums but this was such a let down. Trampoline was different but in time I grew to love it. As a huge Mavericks fan I am just being honest... pass this one up."
5,"Welcome Back, Guys","As usual, Raul Malo has composed another ensemble of great songs. San Jose flows and makes you imagine the scene. Air That I Breathe definitely outdoes the original. As a hardcore Mavericks fan, I'd say this is one of their best. A definite must for the CD collection."
4,"Good, but they get better with time","I can't believe Amazon doesn't sell ""Trampoline,"" a much better example of this band's talent.The self-titled album, though, is good. Tight, tight, tight. These guys practiced. A lot. And they sound good.The cover ""Air That I Breathe"" is a wonderful emulation, and exhibits a sense of understanding what is beautiful about the original. Great choice of a cover, too.Their harmonies are to die for - as a gal you'll want to fall in love with Raul Malo - perfect perfect lyrics and harmonies. Pop-py, fun, comfortable lyrics.Clean, fun, tight, sing-along-able music that precedes the best yet to come."
3,a bit dissapointed,"Nocturnal Rites has evolved yet again. and in my opinion it's only hurt this great band. what New world Messiah lacks that both Afterlife and Shodowland had is energy. I am one of those people who prefer the more aggressive side of metal, and to me when Nocturnal Rites chose to play heavy they were one of the best in the buisness. What you get with New World Messiah is your everyday power metal lacking inspiration and originality. while there are still plenty of hints towards a more aggressive side they are just very few. one thing I must point out though is that the vocalist has never sounded better, and I hope that with their next album they can reastablish the intensity that they once had.all in all if you want to get into Nocturnal Rites get Afterlife or Shadowland first,you wont be dissappointed."
3,Less Good.,"Nocturnal Rites has a new album. The production is fine, but not as good as the Shadowland or Afterlife production. Another thing that makes me give this record a 3 star review is it's relative wimpiness. Even the faster songs are more polished and have less urgency than the greatness of past albums. There is nothing like ""Vengeance"" on this cd, and some of the songs are getting pretty cheesy - more like Gamma Ray, Dream Evil or some bad Dio songs. ""Avalon"" and ""Egyptica"" come to mind as failures. It's good, solid, cliche power-metal, but Nocturnal Rites were my favorite Power Metal band until this album. Even Hammerfall has better aggressive dragon songs than this. Auto Pilot is what these Swedes are driving on. If you're a Power Metal completists, however you should still buy it."
5,Where is the Season 2 DVD set?!,"I have loved this show from the beginning and continue to watch Season 1. I was so sad when the showed stopped airing on TV. This was the one TV show that I religiously watched every week. I'm 27 years old and even though I didn't grow up in the 60's, I fell in love with the story lines and characters. I know the show won't be coming back, but I wish they'd make a DVD set of season 2 and 3 so that I can continue to watch it. I hardly remember what happened and would love to relive those moments one more time."
3,Dazzle DVD--legitimate or not?,there are season two and three sets listed here below from Dazzle DVD--are these legitimatelet me rephrase that--I don't care if these are legitimate --are they playable?!
2,Put Back this Front Yard Book,"I love elaborate front yard plantings, but this book just isn't the inspirational guide that Liz Primeau's similar ""Front Yard Gardens: Growing More Than Grass"" is.It's a fairly pedestrian, utilitarian book, nothing special. The Primeau alternative actually conveys a sense of the excitement and adventure inherent in de-lawning your front, and the examples shown are more interesting than the bland gardens depicted here in Taunton's offering.I've read through this once, then returned it to the library. ""Front Yard Gardens"" I bought, and I've read through it three times. Buy it instead. Do redo your garden, but don't expect Taunton's Front Yard Idea Book to inspire you.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
5,"Great primer, great pictures!","This is a really good first book on front yard gardens and has some excellent pictures. If you're thinking of adding a little life and color to your front yard, striving for some curb appeal or just plain tired of mowing the lawn, pick this up. Easy to read and written in a nice relaxed style, it's a good starter."
5,GLUCOSAMINE,BEST PRODUCT ON MARKET! GOT IT FOR MY 76 YEAR OLM MOM AND KNEE PAIN GONE AFTER ABOUT 4 MONTHS ON PRODUCT!!!
1,Junk,The shocks arrived with the proper installation hardware but turned out to be junk. The shocks ride horribly and I am not sure what to do about it since I would need to uninstall them and send them back. It would be easier to just buy another set somewere else.
2,Would Not Recommend!,"This was a book assigned to us for our book club for December. We try to choose books that are short for December since we are so busy. I found this book very depressing! If it had been a biography, I would recommend it. Since it isn't, I won't. Why would a person read a depressing NOVEL! At least if it were a biography, I'd have learned something."
5,Beautifully Written,"Moving and beautifully written, Otsuka transports us through this tale in a human and poignant way that shows deep compassion."
3,When the Emperor Was Divine,Very well written. Gives the feeling of the camps during WWII and the life changes of one family from their home to the camps and back.
4,Back to the WWII,"This is a great book. ""When the EMPEROR Was Divine"" by Julie Otsuka written in the year 2002. This book is divided in five different chapters. Each chapter is mainly focuses on one of the main character's perspective. The whole story in this book is about the ""Japanese Internment camps"", a.k.a ""Relocation"" or ""Concentration camps"". Therefore, I DO recommend YOU to read this !!.. It's a very good historical story during World War II. If you like history, definitely read this book because it's very to understand. Don't need to think about it, just read it when you have time. It IS time to go back to WWII ..."
4,Good book and good quality,"I liked this book, but it was a little slow. It was a good read, but I bet there are better stories out there like this. It was delicately beautiful."
3,Interesting style of story telling.,"I enjoyed this book, but was not thrilled with the way the story was told. This is the first of her books I have read and I will be reading another one shortly. If she uses the same story telling method I don't know if I will read any more of her books. Not the worst book I've read but not the best either."
4,Definitely worth reading,"I was impressed how the author painted such vivid imagery with such ease. I am by no means a fast reader, but this was a book that I read in a weekend. It's an easy read, no doubt, but also thought provoking. Like any great book does, it aroused my curiosity for the history behind the story. The authors next book is most certainly on my short list of reads."
2,"Kindle cloud ""when the emperor was Devine""","The book itself was excellent. Kindle Cloud is a disaster.. Whatever you do, do not use this platform. Pages turn slowly and aren't numbered. My first and last purchase on Kindle Cloud. PS-Attempts to send feedback to Kindle Cloud were an exercise in futility."
2,Seems to be a lot like another book- to much so,"As an elementary school teacher I read a book entitled, ""Journey to Topaz"". It was a fabulous book. As I began to read ""The Emperor was Divine"" I got the strange feeling I'd read it before. I am almost certain the author of ""The Emperor was Divine"" has too. There are way to many similiarities. I suppose it is entirely possible that they lived an almost identical life as it's a big world. Based on copywrite ""Journey to Topaz"" was written first. I enjoyed it more-perhaps because the characters were far better developed and the storyline was original. It makes me wonder?"
5,Good Book,I received the book and was looking forward to reading it. I have trouble reading due to brain damage and someone suggested I try a book in large print. My book club was reading this book so I ordered it in large print.I never got to read it because I lost it or misplaced it. It's probably in the freezer or my husband's underwear drawer.It came on time and was in great condition.
3,Diaphanous,"This book was so understated that it almost ceased to exist. I had no solid impression of any of the characters; the information given is too scattered and impressionistic for anything to stick. The writing was very precise, at times flashy in its self-consciousness. Having each chapter narrated by a different character is a gimmick so old I wonder why it's still considered trendy. The subject matter is indeed interesting, but don't count on learning much."
3,Another Perspective On the Internment Camps,"This is a very fast and worthwhile read about a Japanese family who suffers the indignities of the World War II internment camps here in the U.S. This book can easily be read in two or three hours if you have uninterrupted time. The construction is rather floaty and impressionistic rather than linear, but the prose is good and clean and easy to follow.Prior to reading this I'd only read about the Manzanar camp in California, so it was interesting to read about the Topaz camp in Utah. The last 40 pages or so are a little more traditionally written and very interesting, if heartbreaking. This section deals with their return to California after 3 1/2 years in the camp, and their attempts to resume their old life.If you also want to read a book with a little more concrete information about this subject, try Farewell to Manzanar. The writing is not as pretty, but it fills in the gaps."
5,a child's view of history...but much more,"The author's use of detail and context allows the reader to experience the trauma of a family divided by internment camp, a young girl's evolution into young womanhood, and a mother's heroic courage. A book suitable for all ages, a gift of a book. The story, compelling and vivid, is rather brief in pages, simple to comprehend, but manages complexity and lyricism in the prose. Read it. Give it as a gift...for that's what it is."
3,When the Emporer was Divine,"Beautifully written, conveys well the sense of loss the Japanese-Americans must have felt, sadness is the best word to describe the overall feeling at the end of this book. Anger, too, at my country. No happy endings for these people."
5,Ditto,"I agree with other reviewers who've characterized this book as ""stunning in its simplicity"" and the like. The writing is succinct to the point of being terse, but it is never less than elegant and incisive. I particularly appreciated that Ms. Otsuka was able to convey the sometimes intense emotions - including anger - that lurked beneath the outward lack of affect that her characters exhibited. The last chapter particularly struck me in this regard. All in all, a very, very good book."
3,Too Short,"I can't say I didn't enjoy this book, although I did wonder why Japanese Americans would still be worshiping the emperor if they were living here. Still, I felt it gave me a feel for what the U.S. did back then and how it might have affected the JAs who taken to internment camps.My complaint about the book is mainly the price. I spent $10 on a book that I read in less than three hours. Sorry, but I'm not made of money, and I feel cheated. If I had paid $3 for the book, I wouldn't complain, but I thought I was getting at least a couple of days of enjoyment. I think Amazon should tell us how long each book is. When you buy an actual book, you can see how long it is. You know, you can see what you're getting for your money. With these ebooks it's a stab in the dark."
2,Only for those who have time to spare,"This book is nothing but a time-waster. Characters have no names and the narrator is never clearly stated. The only thing that was clear was the meaning of the title. Other things, like the last chapter, are poorly done and leave saying ""huh, what was i reading?"" ."
2,"boring, disjointed read","While it's nice to be able to sit down and read a book in one sitting, I suggest you NOT pick this one. It was boring, disjointed and read more like a fine essay than a novella/novel. I truly don't understand what all the hype is about this little book.The writing, while eloquent, is lacking and I just don't have much to say about it other than it is boring. Sorry but had to put in my two cents.There is a disturbing part in the beginning about a dog which I think ruined it for me."
1,Racist,"This book can be insulting. For example, the author talks about the Chinese like they are animals, and talks about how poor the Chinese are. This book is SOOO boring. The author stretches out information that was not needed to make the book longer, and that just made this book so useless. There is no point in reading this book."
2,"Oh, jebus","I admit that I do not feel much sympathy for Japan around the time of World War II. I understand that the principle of sending the Japanese to internment camps was wrong. However, I feel that it is blown much out of proportion. The camps were livable, they received education there, and didn't even have rationing like the rest of the country did at the time. Also, Pearl Harbor was caused by an espionage ring in Hawaii, so I can understand the government's wariness.I agree with what another reviewer said, that their ""divine"" Emperor was the cause of this problem in the first place. Remember, Japan started the war--not us.As for the book, I felt that it was rather condemning all along. I also distrust an author who appears obviously much too young to have experienced this herself. I do not enjoy books on this subject, but if I did read one I would rather it written by someone who was actually there."
3,book review,"Sorry but I was not very happy ready this book. The history was shockingly tramatic time for all characters but to me there seemed to be an element of repetition. I am glad I read it, but would probably not recommend it. I felt that I had either seen a movie previously or read something of a similar ilk."
5,Fantastic!,I really enjoyed this book. She writes the book in 3rd person and it really adds to the sense of invisibility of the family. The book is reflective in nature in that we are told what happens and how it feels to the characters as opposed to experiencing them as they happen. I found this book very thought provoking and timely.
4,exercises in creative writing?,"I enjoyed this novel, but I sometimes felt as if I were reading exercises for a creative writing class. Julie Otsuka's writing is vivid and often makes you feel like you are really there with her characters in their worn but sunny California house or choking on the Utah desert sand. Otsuka's use of different narrative voices is what made this feel like a writing assignment to me, almost like a gimmick or showmanship. The first three chapters of the five in this slender volume feature an omniscient narrator that mostly narrows in on one character per chapter (the mother, the daughter, the son), the fourth chapter is narrated by ""we"" (the children) and the fifth is the father in first person. She also didn't name her main characters, which seemed like an odd and studied choice. Overall, however, I give this 4 or 4.5 stars. I'm curious to read her newest book to see what writing style(s) she chose to use within it."
2,They don't make 'em like this anymore,"There are a lot of bad country singers out there, so it's hard for one to really stand out from the crowd. But Mel Street had the goods in a way that few other did. It's not just that he was bad. He sang honky-tonk in an unctuous, cloying style and performed songs with lyrics that were so bathetic that he simply grabbed you by the lapels and forced you to listen to him--if only to try to figure out ""Is this guy for real, or is this a goof?""This disc is a pretty fair sample of Street at his best/worst. It's not quite as good/bad as the 20-song Street discs that are still available, but it's probably enough for all but the most masochistic listeners."
3,Patty has a good style of song and good band to boot,"I was most taken with the first track of this cd. It started me in the right direction and set the mood for the whole cd. That tune was the warm romantic version that Patty presented called ""Stardust"". This has to be one of the finest versions of this tune I have ever heard. I'm still drulling over the way her pianist Tom McClung handled the keyboard.Patty has a very soothing voice. It is pleasent to listen to. It is one that will entertain you.The band that Patty used for this project was just dandy. They played together very nicely and came up with some good arrangements.The repertoire that was used her was okay. I really enjoyed about half of the songs.The only dull side to this project was the scatting of Patty. I never have been a fan of scatting. I guess i'm just too old fashioned, but scatting is not for me. I like my music straight forward.This cd will be alright to buy. I think your typical music fan will enjoy this cd."
1,WARNING! NOT UNcensored!!!!!,"I recently bought this because I was quite pleased with the Gatas VIP DVD. This DVD is good however it would be MUCH better if it were truly uncensorced as it is advertised. There are many good videos and scenes in this DVD that would be great videos and scenes if these annoying little ""censoring"" blocks didn't cover parts of the ""footage."" This is good, but censored...be wary! Amazon, you should be ashamed and while you're at it...change the way this is advertised because it IS censored!"
5,A Great Gift,I bought this CD for my dad. He loves it!! Says it's definitely worth listening to when you have the time to appreciate the whole experience.
1,better NFP books...,"Dr. Roetzer (sic) is an NFP pioneer in Austria. This book is old, and hard to get, however. There are several other good alternatives, however, like CCL's ""Art of Natural Family Planning"" by Kippley, and Toni Weschler's ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility""."
1,I Would Give This Zero Stars If I Could,This has got to be the WORST album that i have ever listened to. Not only is this a complete waste of money but time too. It's the ultimate bad riot grrl band with shrill screaming and badly written lyrics. In conclusion: it completely blows and has no redeeming value what so ever.
3,Thumb piano,"This thumb piano is a nice size for small children. I have purchased it for my 5-year-old son. It is a Christmas gift, so he has not seen it yet. I was a little disappointed with the sound quality... not as ""clear"" as others I have heard, although it is adjustable. I have not tried to tune it. I think my son will enjoy it as it is a fun,simple way to create melodies."
4,Very hard to tune.,"I wish this would have came tuned, I spent a very long time trying to tune it how it came and I'm still off on a few keys. The problem is you have to loosen the screws to tune one key and in that you might make other keys out of tune, and you can't test how you did till you have screwed them back on (and that changes the pitch as well)It's not a big deal, that's why it still gets 4 stars, it's only slightly annoying =p. Once I get it tuned I know I'll enjoy it much more. It makes a nice low sound, and even with the keys slightly out of tune, I can still play some songs by ear."
3,Very So-so,"I really wanted and fully expected to love this CD. Unfortunately it sounds like it was recorded in someone's living room using a Casio for musical accompaniment. The woman has a nice singing voice and I appreciate that the songs have been slightly slowed to allow non-Spanish speakers more time to process the Spanish sounds, however overall I think of this as an amateur product."
2,"Annoying, not easy to understand","This is one of those children's CD's that you really hope gets lost or smashed before you have to hear it again. It's an example of good intentions, bad results. I speak Spanish fluently, and wanted to share it with my daughters through music. These songs are strangely translated, difficult to understand, and for both reasons, hard to sing along with. My girls cannot imitate the sounds and words, like they can on other Spanish CDs for children (for example, the Orozco CDs are fantastic).Furthermore, the background music is digital/mechanical/metallic - grating.Good things I can say is that there are melodies the children recognize, and the woman's pronunciation and elocution are pretty good.However, I do not recommend this CD to other parents."
2,Sounds like my neighbor singing,"I speak Spanish, and thought I would give this a shot for my music loving daughter, but neither one of us were interested for long. I guess we're spoiled with other, much better sounding Spanish kids music (Juan Luis Orozco for one!!)"
2,buy something else,"my kids did not like this. i thought it was interesting, but the sound quality was less than professional and there were no lyrics."
2,Ile,Not a huge Fan. While the songs were familiar didn't really like the singing or the tempo of the cd. It's just ok
3,"so, so","this book was okay. i had it sitting in my wish list for a while, so i decided to read it. kind of boring and i love to read angel stories, true stories. didnt have much of a punch if you will."
3,Hits and Misses,"This is in fact an art film, featuring splendid acting and a plot that is barely coherent. Two major characters in the story, and several scenes, don't seem to belong at all. Three cheers for Mary Steenburgen and Holly Hunter. The problem seems to fall on the director, whose choppy and confusing style may leave many wondering why they bothered to spend the time with this movie."
1,What dud these people see in this movie?,"This movie was recommended by a critic in the SF Chronicle a few weeks ago and I looked it up on Amazon, and everyone thought it was great. I have no clue what anyone saw in this movie, it's one of the worst stories I have seen in my life! It is totally pathetic! I hung on as long as I could (about one hour), but I finally said ""forget it!"", it's not worth my time!!Gwyn"
3,Holly Hunter is sooo funny!!!,"I Love This Movie! I always made me laugh! Holly Hunter, Tim Robbins, and Mary Steenburgen are hilarious as a family. Carnelle (Hunter)is trying to win a beauty contest for the fourth of July like her cousin Elain (Steenburgen). My favorite part is the IR romance between Tim Robbins and Alfre Woodard. It is really good!"
5,you must see this movie,"I just watched this movie the other day and i must admit in the beginning i was wondering where my brain had went to. As it progressed it got better and eventually had me engrossed in the life of Carnelle. Alfre Woodard is great. Although i do not care for Mary Steenburgen she was good in this movie. I absolutely love Tim Robbins. He is my favorite actor, so of course i loved his role as the black sheep brother, Delmount. All in all this is a must see and i highly recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a quality film."
4,Overpriced...,"Wonderful toy, but overpriced! The toy performs wonders. Don't pay attention to the ""2 bubbles"" review, must have been using ""heavy duty"" batteries, this toy NEEDS alkaline batteries. 2 C Duracell batteries, 6 hours and Buzz is just *barely* showing signs of weakness, it has plenty of battery life endurance. The toy meets expectations of operation for me and my autistic son who expects most toys to outdo themselves. He's having too much fun to complain this time =)However, I expected a bubble wand for my son to blow bubbles too. I needed to dig out the old chewed up one from a drawer. My son loves to bite them.Amazon's description is misleading:""Batteries: 2 C batteries required. (included)""THEN a few lines below it:""Requires 2 C batteries, not included.""UNFORTUNATELY, I read the top description that said the batteries were included.Regardless of Amazon's mistake, for this price I would have included batteries at least!"
1,Disappointed on Christmas Day,"I purchased this toy for my 3 year old nephew because he loves Buzz Lightyear and of course loves playing with bubbles. I brought C batteries because that is what the description said it used. When we went to put the batteries in on Christmas Day, we were suprised because the battery compartment was for 2 ""AA"" batteries. Fortunately, I keep batteries at home, so I had them. We put them in, and...nothing. We tried another 2 batteries, but still....nothing. I hope I kept the receipt because this was a bust....on Christmas Day!!! Very disappointed."
1,Total Rip Off.,Blows one big bubble at a time which pops before it even leaves the machine. Gazillion bubbles?? Not so much.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my son as a reward for his toilet training. While He was thrilled with it, I am disappointed. It only blew one big bubble at a time, and went through Batteries like crazy.If Buzz Lightyear wasn't such a huge hit with my son, it would have been a total waste of money.Lisa"
1,cobraco hheirn embossed bronze hose holder,"Do NOT buy this product unless you plan on keeping it well protected indoors and then I'm not sure it will not rust. I have mine for less than two weeks and it is rusted. The rim on the top and all the sides are rusted. This is JUNK. If I could give it less than one star, I would. In fact, this is more like a minus 10 stars. I guess I'll have to get a can of Rustolium and spray it but I'm sure it will not last long. Waste of $69.00. I would love to return it but I don't think they will take it back after 10 days. Maybe I'll try anyway before I get the Rustolium."
4,Looks good on my porch,"I have had a hose reel on my front porch for a long time. I did not like the look, but thought my wife could more easily put the hose away with a reel. It turns out the reel was too difficult to operate, so I had to put the hose away anyway and the reel didn't look very good. With this hose pot I don't find the hose much more difficult to put away and it looks much better. I would like to have cover for it so when you get close you don't see the hose in the pot, but from the curb it looks much nicer. I'm not sure of the quality of the finish, so we'll see how it holds up with time."
3,Beautiful Pot......except for the rust,"The pot looks great.............except when it stays out in the rain. After the rain, there were rust stains both inside and out....as well as on the hose. One would think that since this item is designed to hold a hose and stay outside, it would be better protected against the elements. Since the first one of these was sent back because it was damaged when received, I guess I expected more when I obtained the replacement. Great holder if it is to be protected from the elements......just not good for my needs."
3,Nice until it rusts....,"It's very pretty, but in about 6 months will be all rusted. The handles clack loudly when pulling the hose out or putting it in. Easily fits 75 feet of hose but not 100. I'll probably try and get it sand blasted then spray paint it later this year to get rid of the rust. Too bad it isn't copper, but then again it's far cheaper than copper!"
3,"Not bad, but ...","This item looks great,but after a week outdoors it started to show signs of rust. I put a coat of car wax on it which will hopefully help, but I expected an outdoor item to be weatherproof."
1,Disappointed,Feel I got taken with this purchase. Ordered XL. If thats what XL is what do the big guys wear. Cost a hunderd bucks worth ten maybe. According to the news story on NBC it's a cheap knock off. I checked the details they said was tell tale to a imitation and it fits the discription. Wish I could return it and get my money back.
5,Great!!!,"I ordered this one for my Laptop that has Windows Vista and I am very happy. It was so easy to install and the resolution is great. For it's price, I can't ask for more."
1,Not worth the money,"I ordered this webcam and it started having problems after a week. First the picture only came in black and white. After a few more days, the picture kept getting darker until it was no longer visible. Because of the cheap price, it's not worth the shipping cost for a replacement. Since then, I purchased a Logitech webcam."
3,End of Service Life?,"I went to Creative's support page to determine if this webcam would work on my 64-bit Windows 7 system, and I was met with this:..Live! Cam Vista IM (VF0420)Thank you for your interest.End of Service LifeThe product you have selected has been classified as 'End of Service Life'...Fortunately, further down the page there is a driver for Windows 7, both 32- and 64-bit. But, there hasn't been anything updated for this product since Jan 2010. Hmmm."
1,Works with Windows 7 OS?,Am not sure if it will be working with Windows 7 OS.I have a creative webcam VF-0080 and creative no longer supports it. It doesnt provide the drivers for windows 7. The webcam inspite of being in working condition is unusable because creative is not ready to work on developing the drivers for it. I find it very strange because any upgraded or new version of software should at least have this basic backward compatibility.. Negative points for the customer support/service to creativeI got a new webcam but this time got a Logitech webcam..Creative has lost a loyal customer...
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"The treatment given the subject of plagiarism and fraud in historical studies deserves a more thorough treatment than given by Mr Wiener. In the episodes I have some familiarity with, those of Bellesiles and the Vesey conspiracy, Mr Wiener protests the outcome using using the same idealogical approach as he decries in the original participants in the exposure of the fraud, i.e., he does not give a complete presentation of the evidence. On the other hand, it is somehow comforting to know that the professorial ranks are subject to the same petty jealousies that everyone else experiences in everyday life, and the descriptions of the Goodwin and Ambrose cases are entertaining."
4,The Chilling of Historiography,"Wiener's book does not attempt to settle the scholarly controversies which it describes. It was written to inform us of actions taken against historians who incur the wrath of the political Right. He concedes the work of these historians was flawed: but the point is that the tactics used against them, so as to discredit their work, or even drive them from the profession, smack of totalitarianism. For contrast, he shows us rightist historians who violated fundamental rules of careful scholarship and got a slap on the wrist, followed by a reward from the White House.A very disturbing book. Prospective historians will read it and perhaps chose a less hazardous discipline---to everyone's loss."
2,He still got the voice.,"I love the Ramones, and also Joey. To sad he's gone!For me, this album only has two good tunes. What a Wonderful World, and Don't Worry About Me. All the other song is there also, and I can listen to it only because of the voice.This is for the old fans only, maybe? Cause if you are, this is his last work before the cancer took him away. Then you should buy the album. If you're not a fan, try the old Ramones, then become a fan, and then buy this album!"
1,Not happy with this product,"I am not very pleased with this product. I couldn't understand why my cat kept getting sick. Now I know why after searching online and reading other reviews. Other cats have been getting sick on these too! My cat really loved the Greenies, but they certainly didn't love him back. I will never purchase this again and I have found Whisker Lickins in the grocery store that my finicky feline has decided are worth his effort :o) I wish I could give this a positive review, but I can't . . ."
5,Cat that loves them,My cat loved them and as a result constantly comes to ask for more! Very very happy with the product!
5,The CISO Handbook,At last a comprehensive view of what a total security program needs to be. So much of the literature on the subject is about technology only that this wholistic approach is a breath of fresh air. It is clearly and simply written and provides an easy to follow roadmap for any security manager to follow in developing an enterprise security program.
1,terrible customer service,"I cancelled the order b/c it was too arrive 5 days later than what was promised when I ordered. I called to have my credit card refunded, the first person said no problem we will cancel the order and refund your money. I waited for 10 days and nothing happened, I called back and at this point they refused to refund my money and then blamed the whole mistake on me.....the customer. They are disorganized and advertise that their products will go out immediately, which is not the case. I order off of Amazon all the time and this is the only bad experience that I have had with anyone. I would not recommend ordering from this company."
4,Ogden Nash,"A popular writer in the '30's this is a compulation of letters to family etc. He has a style and wit that is charming and makes a comfortable read. His devotion to his wife, Frances, and his children is heartwarming and ever present in his letters. It causes you to realize the lost art of letter writing and the ease which now-a-days people communicate. There are also wonderful family photos and mentions of famous people who were his friends during that era."
4,A little surprised,"This set was a gift for my daughters birthday because she loves the Babysitters club. There were two movies, The Babysitters Club and Troop Beverley Hills. The Babysitters Club was good, as expected but The Troop Beverley Hills had a few cuss words that were a surprise to both me and my children. Other than that it was a good purchase. So if you dont mind your child listening to cussing its a great choice, but as for me I like to monitor what my children watch because even the little things play a part in their overall well-being and who they become as people."
3,"Great book, a lot of research, hard to understand",I purchased this biography for an assignment I have to do. As a high school student this book was hard for me to understand. The author of this book is a famous nostradamus critic that knows and did a lot of research and its shown in the book. I would give this book 4 stars if it was a bit more exciting.
4,Worked perfectly,"This is a good-looking watch unlike others. The manual is lacking in teaching you how to use a heart monitor, but you can get the general information from the Internet or even download instruction manual of other brands to learn how to use a heart monitor.At first I failed to get the heart beat to show up, but after recycled all the modes and back to Heart monitor mode and waiting for the blinking dots, the number showed up."
2,Weird watch and clicking noise,"The watch isn't one I'd wear around which is a requirement since I don't want to have to change watches all the time and I work out daily. My biggest issue was that it makes a clicking sound when your heart beats and though I'm sure I wouldn't notice it after a while, I just decided to send it back. I'll stick with my Timex Race Trainer."
3,"""Beautiful Tomorrow"" was much better. But this ain't bad.","I thought that ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" (also by Blue Six) was far better. Maybe my expectations for this album were too high. In any case, this album wasn't too bad. I'd classify it as 'ultra-chill'"
3,Aquarian Angel,"This cd has the ""Blue Six"" sound. It is extremely mellow and heavenly... If you like the first cd, you may like this one as well. More of an easy listening, chillout flow, extremely mellow - some songs have an angelic flow..."
2,Absolutely dissapointing!,"I had HIGH hopes for this CD when I first heard about it. I gave it days even months to grow on me, but it didn't. It lacks the magic of the ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" and energy of it as well. The songs are too slow and there is not enough variety. The only song I liked was the title of the album ""Aquarian Angel"". Aya does well with this track as only she could. However, the rest of the tracks are slow, have the same drum patterns and just downright boring.I can't recommend this and I agree with another reviewer that this album sounds like some tracks they had just laying around and decided to throw it together for an album. If you have the 1st Blue Six CD, don't bother with this one."
3,its ok....,"I personally was fascinated with the 1st CD and probably promoted it to others as much as a marketing company. This one sounds like some B side tracks from the first on and a few tracks from Aya's CD thrown in for filler. Its good if you don't have Aya's CD or the 1st Blue Six CD. If you do, you really needn't bother."
4,Gorgeous Grooves!,"I was curious about how a follow-up to Beautiful Tomorrow could achieve relevance without sounding dated. Beautiful Tomorrow, in effect, I think was a vicitim of it's own success with the Naked Music sound in jeopardy of being ""copy-catted"" to death.Aquarian Angel is the remedy. It's completely unique and exactly where sophisticated house needs to go next . . . Standout tracks include ""Tropicalia"" and ""You Just Can't Stop"" - the vocals and lyrics on the latter track are quite profound and delivered with just the right amount of heartache, wisdom, and soul by Catherine Russell. Stunning!"
4,Not bad of a CD!,"""Aquarian Angel"" was what made me get the CD because of the fact that my sign is Aquarius. But trust me, this CD is not bad at all with the jazz, house, and soul trying to chill out, you know what I'm saying? The only reason why I rated ""Aquarian Angel"" 4 stars was because of the fact that Blue Six didn't have more remixes. But that's okay. I'm going to accept the CD for the way it is! It is still good, no matter what.Please buy this CD if you are interested in music like this!"
4,Another Naked Music winner,"I love this cd.Very mellow, down/midtempo,sultry soulfull,sexy with light touches of funk throughout.Very easy to listen to but never boring."
4,A NAKED DELIGHT,"THE NAKED MUSIC CREW HAS PUT OUT ANOTHER LATE NITE CLASSIC, THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST ALBUM, I PLAY THIS ONE WHILE CRUISING IN THE RIDE AT NITE, AND WHEN I HAVE COMPANY OVER .LOVE HOW THEY FUSE HOUSE ,SOUL AND TROPICAL ELEMENTS INTO THEIR SOUND.OVERALL GOOD CD ,"
2,merely OK transfers from vinyl to CD,"I bought this CD because the LP of ""The Wild Side Of Life"" was on high rotation in our family home when I was VERY young. I've heard some of these songs (""Wild Side Of Life"" and ""Great White Bird"") on CD in pristine condition, however I was disappointed to find that all tracks on this CD are merely quite average digitally treated transfers from vinyl which was mostly in very bad condition.There's no excuse for this because this week I imported (from the USA for US$6) a very good condition copy of the LP which, with a day's careful editing, has given me a CD which sounds absolutely perfect.Burl Ives' arrangements were as amazingly good as the musicians and backing vocalists he chose to work with - and this album really deserved to be released as mastered from the original tapes (or at least from excellent condition vinyl)."
4,BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE,"THIS MOVIE WAS SIMPLY MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE FIRST. THE LEPRECHAUN RETURNS TO GO AFTER A GIRL THAT'S A DESCENDENT OF A GIRL THAT HE WANTED 1,000 YEARS AGO. HAS BETTER CHARACTERS AND EVEN BETTER MURDER SEQUENCES. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN THE SERIES. THIS IS A GOOD HORROR SEQUEL THAT FANS OF THE SERIES SHOULD ENJOY."
3,LEPRECHAUN 2 IS THE SEQUEL TO RECOMMEND,"Not a bad sequel to part 1,this second chapter was directed by Rodman Flender who directed Idle Hands and this one stars wily and disgusting Leprechaun arriving in Los Angeles searching for a bride and when he sees one he must keep her and marry her.Lots of gore and wicked humor to keep audiences watching their screen and Leprechaun becomes more nastiful than childish.recommend for film buffs."
3,it was okay,an okay movie.but not as good as the first one.but still pretty funny.its still worth renting.
2,Horrid,"Bad puns, limmericks and jokes. Not gory and with very few laughs. Could have sworn James Van Der Beek was in this or maybe it was just another actor with no emotions."
2,part 2 should be remade,"After a such a cult hit the first Leprechaun was I remember I couldn't wait to see the next entry. So I rented this one again in 2003 and remember why I don't remember this movie much since I first saw it. It was pure boring. Warwick Davis was very entertaining as usual, but the story itself just didn't work for me.I have gave this Lep movie 2 stars cause it had two classic killings in the movie. The Double circular saw blade seen to that kid's face was classic as well as drunk guy giving birth to a pot of gold."
4,viwer,I WANT ME GOLD!!!!!! this film is cool! nice! mabey not as god as number but better than 3! LEPRECHAUN 2 rules!
4,The Sequel,You get a good price for this movie. The movie itself isn't all that great but there is a good price for this Dvd movie. Ususally Dvd movies cost up t0 20-30 dollars a peiece! I would get this movie but it isn't all that great.
3,Leprechaun Part 2,"The little Irish Leprechaun returns in this horror film. Although it isn't at all scarey, it is still pretty good. It is not as good as the first but it is still okay. This time the little Irish monsteris back looking for love after being robbed a few years before, actually about 1,000 years before by an arch rival. I suggest you buy this first rate movie."
3,The terror of Ireland,The Leprechaun has return vile and evil as ever. Not as good as the first on but still a good movie. Ending not as good as the first.The Leprechaun is back he is qafter a bribe which he can old posses once every 1000 years. Leprechaun tries to get his bribe the Bribe father stop him. Leprechaun is forced to wait another thousand years to get another bride.A good movie with an explosive climax inside the Leprechaun Lair. If you like this one she you four other sequels and the prequel.
2,proabably the best of the series,"the best one of the series has a good premise and an interesting story, though some parts are way better then others. the part where the leprechaun gets drunk is hilarious and then cut to him in the coffee shop trying to get sober is uproarous. if you can find logic in this one good for you, you get a kewpie doll.faavorite lineLeprechaun(after breaking off someguys finger)- finger licking good"
2,not very solid or exciting,"compared with leprechaun 3 and lep in the hood (lep 5), this one really doesn't have much to offer. it's not nearly as witty or inventive and it comes off as mostly just a slasher type movie with a few awesome warwick davisisms. skip it if you can, but if you must see it, then be forewarned"
3,Not the greatest Leprechaun movie.,I rented the movie after watching Leprechaun. The movie is good with alot of comedy and mystery. But it is still rather predictable about who will die. Take out the man who played his bride's boyfriend's guardian I would give it 4. Give just a few more twists to the plot I'd rate it a 5.
2,lousy,"this movie has pretty good acting, but that can not save the film from a bad script and bad screenplay. No real scares. The kills aren't realistic or gruetestic."
1,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the worst movie i have ever seen corney, fake, cheesy, boring thats the whole movie lepricons are sopust to be peace ful not going around killing people."
5,Perfect for powder room or small bath,"This elegant little vanity is an excellent product at a good price. I've seen similar products at Horchow and Neiman Marcus for hundreds of dollars more.It arrived promptly and packed nicely. All in all, I'm thrilled with this purchase."
3,A colourful Jewish family saga,"A colourful Jewish family saga spanning the period from the late 1800's to the late 1960's.It is the story of Nahum Rabinowitz/Raeburn, who immigrates from Russia to Scotland , and builds up a fortune.He marries his youth sweetheart Miri, after her first husband passes away , and the novel shifts it's focus to Miri's children by her first and second marriages.A colourful array of men and women , and a fairly pleasant read. Tends to drag in parts but picks up in others."
2,"Loved it, until it broke","I received this coffee maker as a gift for my wedding and we loved the way it looked and worked, until two years later and it suddenly broke. The clock still works, but when you try to brew coffee, it's as if a fuse or something blows. Hubby says it's an electrical problem and it's ready for the garbage. Which is sad because Mr. Coffee was always a trusted, reliable name, but I think a seventy dollar coffee pot should last for more than 2 years."
3,Disappointed,"I have had this coffee pot for a couple of years, and have had enough issues that I'm giving up on it. It leaks, doesn't secure the filter resulting in grounds in the pot, and currently it is brewing coffee as weak as tea. When it works it's great, it just doesn't work great consistently."
1,Disappointing longevity,"This machine worked well for a year, except that the words wore off the plastic, so I had to remember which button was which. Then one day I came out to a bright morning -- only to find hot coffee all over the counter, dripping down on to the floor. Turns out that the little plastic tube that carries the water broke.Cheap piece of garbage. Pick something else."
4,Excellent text but awful answer keys and Solution Manual,"I just finished taking my first Organic Chemistry course and got an A -- and this text was a huge reason why. Her organization and explanation of reactions and mechanisms was great and her graphics were very helpful. This text was a huge improvement over my General Chemistry textbook (Zumdahl's Chemistry) which was awful. This text made the course very comprehensible. Only two things kept me from giving this book five stars. One, the answer key, both in the text and in the Solution Manual, was completely unreliable and many of the answers were wrong. Prentice Hall must have used one of their editorial interns to check the answer keys. Very sloppy work. Two, the NMR and IR chapters (Ch. 12 & 13) weren't as clear and comprehensible as the other chapters. Other than that, however, an excellent text for the Organic Chemistry novice."
4,Good book for OpenGL,"I gave this book as a present. And, they loved this book a good learning tool for OpenGL. I highly recommend."
1,OpenGL Shading Language,"The book is random set of GLSL topics, the examples are incomplete and most of them useless. If you are a beginner this book is not for you and if you are not then you already know most of the stuff so in any case you don't need this book, save you money!"
1,Disappointment,"This is an eccentric, shallow and incomplete review of the period suggested in the title. It consists of brief summaries of scientific advances, selected brief biographies and a smattering of primary documents. The chronology of events covered stops at 1713. Thus it hardly covers the time span 1500-1900 suggested by the series title. Too disjointed to function as an enjoyable leisurely read, nor comprehensive enough to function as a reference work. Not worth the money."
1,$50 card for $39.99 on amazon!,"There is a much better deal for iTunes gift cards on amazon - $50 iTunes cards for only $39.99 each! Search ""$50 iTunes gift card"" and look at the different sellers and get them while they are there at this price."
4,View of the Business of Contract Archaeology,"Joe Pachinko's book, ""Swamp"", is a stark and semi-realistic look at the business known as contract archaeology. In humorous tones, he shows the reader what some contract archaeology businesses are doing or should we say not doing in the United States today. It shows that like most businesses, the almighty dollar is the most important driving force. The good in the novel are that the two heros are into archaeology not for the money but for something more. Everybody in archaeology working as a professional or is interested in archaeology should read this book."
5,Pachinko has balls!,"I love this book! If you like adventure, environmental awareness, romance, scatology, and most of all HUMOR, you won't be disappointed here. In fact, SWAMP is very hard to put down once you start reading. Ostensibly a story of impoverished contract archaeologists, this book actually has a much bigger scope, the toxification of the world by the clueless. Some of these clueless characters are so funny, I couldn't breathe from laughing so hard. Of course, the environment is a sad subject, too, but I think Pachinko's leavening the subject with such brilliant and insightful humor makes the 'message' go down a lot easier. Be aware, Be entertained, Buy the book!"
4,The field tech's munsell,Packinko has acheived with Swamp what no one else has had the liver to attempt. The era of archaeology (CRM) being garbled with glory and gold has begun the overdue process of being expunged. A true reading of field work has finally come into view. Anyone need a munsell? Let's have a toast to Joe. Where is the sequel? Where are you?? Surely there is more to tell.
3,Good insights but disagree with some of the conclusions!,"The strong thrust placed on evangelism did seem to leave the Church as a whole, sickly. We as believers should be holy, righteous, and live blameless lives before the world. Traditions can be good & they can be bad as the book has stated. The book does not bring out how God works in the hearts of his people to bring them into holiness & righteousness. I agree with Peter Gillguist that God does call His people to finish the race, which I believe, was the best part of the book!"
4,Good gift for a carpenter,"This item is just what it was indicated to be. I am pleased with the item, but would have prefered to have one in gold color."
3,Dublin 4,Dublin 4Nothing special thought she has done a lot better in the past. A bit disappointed but will still read her next book
1,A Huge Disappointment,"The majority of this book was a huge buildup for an event that never even happened. When I came to the end of the book, it felt like there should be another few chapters. I LOVE Maeve Binchy, but this book was truly disappointing."
3,"Pretty Pictures, Little Substance","Savannah's Bonaventure Cemetery is a beautiful and haunting place to visit, and the book captures much of that beauty in plentiful photographs. But if you are looking for a history of Bonaventure, this volume is a light weight. Most of the facts are there, but their arrangement is haphazard, with little logical sequence. I was looking for some background informaiton on the original colonial plantation and the family that owned it, but found mostly information on various tombs, markers and headstones."
5,The ONLY pen I like to use,"I think these are the best and most comfortable pens to use. I am a student and I have to write a lot. These pens don't hurt my fingers at all even after hours of writing. The ""center of gravity"" part means that it feels perfectly weighted in your hand. I have written with it so much I now buy refills because this is the only pen I want to use.It's also cute that it comes in various pen colors!"
5,An easy return,I liked it but it was a little big for me. I returned it very easily though which allows me to want to buy from them again.
5,A Must Have for Anyone Who Grills!,"I received this as a gift because I have been trying to eat healthier and I love to grill. The recipes are incredible, easy to do, and make you look like a ""Grill Master""! I LOVE the fact it is 3 cookbooks in 1 hardbound cover. I have used this book for so many occasions, from everyday meals to special events, it is with the top 3 of my grilling cookbooks! The recipes are delicious and actually spark the imagination to be creative on some of your own good old standby recipes. Whether for yourself, or as a gift, you will be VERY pleased with this purchase!"
4,"VERY Quite, and rns like a charm","replaced my old 40gb 4200rpm with this drive. After 1 month of use, not only does my 4 year laptop run much quiter, but boots and runs 30% faster, and laptop battery now lasts longer !!!In short if u need a drive to replace an old or dead drive, and have no need for tons of space for multimedia, then ur search ends here."
1,Horrible,"I never liked the Superstar editions and found this particularly awful.However,there is something good about it,and that is that it reveals that marijuana IS a dangerous drug.In this novel,dorky Enid with her dorky name and her dorky everything starts hanging out with one of the bad boys from her past,they take marijuana and then crash their car!Jessica accidentally gets high as well!!This book always gave me nightmares,plus it is boring.I don't like it."
5,Best book on Rome.,This book was very helpful to me in planning my trip to Rome. I will never be able to see everything I would like to be able to visit and understand. It is helpful to read about the major items to gain understanding before seeing the wonder that is Rome.
4,Probably somewhat too complicated for an intro book,"Following this text can be quite difficult for one who has a weak command of mathematics or of basis physics principles. The examples are quite interesting, unlike many other textbooks. I must admit that most physics texts for scientists are more complicated than this. When the material is reexplained in a clear manner, the book makes perfect sense. I think that frustration with this book is due highly in part to those who took physics not realizing how challenging it can be, especially for those who do not understand such concepts easily. As for simply skipping lectures and trying to understand physics by reading the book, this is likely to be a complete failure; I don't know if any physics book could appropriately explain physics in an understandable manner without supplement. The problems, however, in the text are excellent, and while sometimes challenging, they are essential for a student to be able to solve problems on exams."
1,More of a Reference than an Instructional Text,"This book reads like a beginner's CRC Handbook. Concepts are only briefly explained with some derivation of equations and definition of the variables. Examples are useless for students that need to see an actual calculation to do problems since most read like mathematical proofs. Yes, the problems are good.....but they'd be better if the text supported their difficuly, in which a good 90% dive into concepts that students have not encountered in the reading.Lectures are short and most are taught by individuals that could care less about intro physics students, so the student must learn a bulk of the course outside of the classroom. This can't be done with this empty, pompus, overly technical book."
3,"Not The Best, Not the Worst","I used this as a text book for three semesters of University education. Some chapters are fine and quite readable, and others are random and completely lack organization. Some chapters take one point and beat it into the ground with a large baseball bat made out of lead, others mention something once and assume you understand it completely.The examples are fair but compared to some of the chapter end questions you'd scarcely believe that they came from the same book, the difficulty varies greatly. As for the explanations even the best in this book I did not find as well stated or helpful to understanding as those found in Tipler's ""Physics for Scientists and Engineers."" Buy this book if you are taking a class and they require you to use it, buy it not if you are trying to learn physics on your own, as I doubt it will help you very much unless you already know it."
2,"Great Book, terrible condition","The Resnick book was suggested to me by an old physics teacher from college. It doesn't explain things in as unique and interesting of a manner as Feynman's lectures, but it does provide a consistent string of problems to help keep the material interactive and prevents you from coming at it at the end with just a nod and a ""uh huh"".Sadly, the book that I ordered was in such terrible condition that it was almost impossible to read it, the hardcover only barely clinging for sweet life on the thread of hope. So I had to order the book from another source. If you can get this book in a good condition and pair it with the Feynman lectures on physics, then you should be in a good way to finding new and interesting things out about the world around you."
4,Very helpful,"This student solution manual is very helpful and I often find it more useful than the examples in the book. Their explanations are clear and easy to understand. I use it every week when I do my Physics homework. However, I think it'd be nicer if all the odd number problems are in there instead of most of the odd ones. Besides the student solution manual, the Wiley high education website also offers other sources for students, such as problem hints, which are helpful as well."
3,Not bad for a textbook...,This book is really pretty good. It has a lot of cool pictures (like one of the author sticking his hand in molten lead). It is hard to learn physics just by reading a book. The more important thing is how well the teacher teaches.
1,Worst Physics Book!!!,"As others have already stated, this physics book does not cover physics in terms that beginning college students can understand. This book is made for those in advance courses that already have the fundamentals and just need something easy to thumb through for reference. I guess the author expects the professor to discuss all of the topics in a more broad sense and only use the book for a reference. I know this is not true because I got my hands on an older edition, I think the second or third, and it was not nearly as bad as this edition. Recommendation is to not listen to your teacher and purchase another Physics book. I used Contemporary College Physics second edition in a previous course and it was just as good in the course that this physics book was needed."
4,"WELL-ABOVE AVERAGE, BUT NEED SOME TOUCHES","The reputation of this book is well-deserved. But, it is good to note that any student whose foundations in Geometry and Algebra are wanting, may not cope very well.Most of the chapters which make-up the Mechanics section have solid back-bone. I am particularly impressed by the way it handled Rotational Dynamics, Gravitation, and Simple Harmonic Motion. Its Electricity and Magnetism sections are equally grounded. However, the same cannot be said about Optics, Heat, as well as some of the chapters that belonged to Sound. Also, this is not among the texts that I regard as beginner-friendly; but if your background in Mathematics is above average, there is very little to worry about.Overall, this is a nice Physics text, although that its authors need to improve on the sections describing Heat and Optics."
3,"A brief, cluttered primer of calculus based physics.","Essentially, the book offers few descriptions of the fundamental problems encountered in everyday physics and assumes that the reader know most of the material already. I used this book in a calulus based course and did well, but I was forced to use other textbooks to gain a clearer understanding of the subject."
2,Book is tough to understand.,"This book -- proclaimed by many to be THE book in physics -- is not the best introduction to physics for students. For one thing, the mathematics in the books is mind-boggling difficult. The authors use vector calculus and advance calculus and offer no primer for students who have weak calculus skills.Another big problem with the book is the shoddy explanations. The writing isn't very clear. Often, I'd finish reading a chapter and would absolutely have NO clue as to what I had just read.In sum, I'd stay far away from this book. The book has challenging problems at the end but doesn't develop the conceptual base to tackle those problems."
2,What a Struggle,I'm using this book for a distance learning course in physics. I suspect it was not written for distance learning. I often find it hard to relate the answers to chapter problems to the explanations in the text. I also have a copy of Cutnell & Johnson's Physics 6th edition. The thinking in the latter is a lot easier to follow.
1,NEGATIVE 5 STARS,"This book, and it's complimenting e-grade system has made Physics the worst experience of my college life thus far. The problems are confusing, the grammar is very poor, and the book lacks organization. The worst thing is the e-grade system. Picky and ungodly slow, it has frustrated hundreds of students, as well as their professors. I found myself at the tip of anger when it took me over 5 hours to complete an assignment, simply because the pages took around 5-10 minutes to load.Please DO NOT SUPPORT THESE PEOPLE. They are evil and need to be banished from writing bad textbooks and frustrating students further."
1,Not Good,"This physics book ""helped"" me through two horrendous semesters of Purdue University physics. There is absolutely no correlation between the text and the homework problems, which lead all of us engineers to wish bad things upon the Purdue physics department and the authors. If the chapters were a bit more clear, maybe I'd have gotten an A first semester and a B second, rather than B and C, respectively."
5,This used to be our Physics bible,Myself and my brother used this book as our textbook. We learnt our basics and prepared for the competitive exams with this book as reference. I will recommend and pass on this book to my son for his Physics and math fundamentals.
2,This book like fool me around!,"If u know that ur college uses this book for teaching Physics, then take it in other where! Because u must be regret if u take physics with this book!"
1,too hard to follow,this book was too in depth for the fifth grade level. I failed all the test and struggled with the homework assignments. My teacher did not speak english and did not help much either. I would recommend taking chemistry instead.
5,When the Good Guys Used to Win,"I enjoyed the record very much. The lyrics are nostalgic and make you ""feel good."""
5,Frankie Avalon Songs are always Great,"Buy this CD and enjoy Frankie Avalon singing this new song ""When The Good Guys Used To Win"" because it is a good song that has a good message to people and Frankie is a good guy.The other song in this CD is his best known song Venus and Frankie Avalon sings just like he always does Great.Frankie Avalon is a good singer.He should record more songs.They should ask Frankie Avalon record the song ""Unforgettable"" and other songs."
1,Bitter finger-pointing,"I hated this song. Doesn't Avalon have anything better to write about? He blindly writes off all today's problems, blaming them on everyone else. Praise profits, pass the social security. I'm sure it'll be a gold seller in the retirement homes."
1,The Lover,"Well to tell the truth the book was down right boring, Eagle jack is a nice enough guy but susanna did nothing but get on my nerves all she did was whine and argue through out the whole book, I was waiting for it to get exciting but that never happendit was dull from page one, I don't even think Eagle jack fell in love with her unless i missed that part?"
2,"Complain, complain, complain","Susanna agrees to let Eagle Jack be the boss on the trail and she constantly disagrees and puts her voice in where she should be listening and learning. It got to be so boring. Eagle Jack was so likable. If I were the guy, I would have left her the first day. Susanna was not worth sticking around. She wouldn't change if she tried."
3,Not bad at all,"After reading the other reviews, had to write this. I enjoyed the movie, thought the acting was allright, and the story line was pretty good. Also liked Bruce Payne in it. Not a great movie, but worthwhile werewolf movie to watch"
3,DVD is Unrated!,"Forget what the box says, and what other people have said here, this is the 97 minute unrated version. This is not the first title put out by a company stating it was an R when in fact it was the unrated version, probably because they wanted to get past the chain store censors that won't carry anything harder than an R rating."
2,"Good Idea, poor execution....","What can I say? I love werewolf movies. But this one bites. (No pun intended). Max Dire (more wolf pun names), is a down-on-his-luck police detective. With a series of tragic events threatening to overwhelm him, Max gets involved with a therapy group whose leader is a werewolf (the Howling anyone?)At first intrigued by the group, Max soon learns that these officers mean business - they're injecting werewolf blood to fight crime.Okay, if you're like me, you might think the plot of this movie sounds cool. Werewolves as 'good guys?' A horror/police action movie? Well, I think again. The movie has some decent special effects, but THAT'S ALL. The script is poorly handled, the dialog amateurish, and the acting like cardboard. If you want a good 'werewolf movie' see dog soldiers. Much better."
4,Full Eclipse,First off what the hell is up with Van Pebbles hair in this movie? I like this movie it was a different take on the werewolf story and a pretty good one. I would recommend this movie if you like werewolf stories or just monster movies in general.
4,Cops and Werewolves,"ok he is a cop, he is also the man running a elite crime fighting unit that manages to wipe out all crime in an area then moves on.... however after investigation (mario van peebles) discovers this has happened over and over city to city so he begins to Investigate a past on his elite unit boss and finds out some very disturbing facts. it would seem the serum they take to Enhance them in battle is something not natural. so he delves deeper to bring about the Shocking conclusion to this Exciting movie. lost one star for just a touch of cheese on some of the acting."
4,nice humidifier!,We like this kettle very much. It could not be used as a teapot - it gets rusty on the inside - and it is very heavy and somewhat difficult to lift; but it sits on top of the wood stove and helps to humidify our house in the dry winter. Excellent value for the money!
4,Good,This item was backordered; but it did eventually make it. It is heavy and a perfect addition to my wood stove.
2,Poor design,"The body of the kettle is what I expected having purchased basic kettles before. But that is all I can say that is good. The lid is designed (too flat) so there is nothing to grip when lifting or turning the lid to add water if the kettle is hot. The handle is also designed poorly. The wire wrapping that prevents burning your hand when lifting is too flimsy and your fingers slip through to the wire handle. I switched the lid and handle from an old kettle to this one. Otherwise, I would have returned it."
5,Great for the price,Wanted something to put on the wood stove to help humidify the air. This si a heavcy tough kettle.
4,Works great,"Yes, this kettle does get somewhat rusty straight away on the bottom, but it adds character and functions perfectly fine. As cast iron it's supposed to look a bit weathered. There was a smell the first few times water boiled down, but now that we've been using it for a couple of months the smell is gone and the kettle is 'broken in'. We love it!"
4,Super fast and affordable,i just got one of these for my Nikon D70. It costs the same as a one gigabyte compact flash card. It doesn't have quite as fast of a write speed but it does fine for the 3 pictures per second on the nikon d70.
4,"Important Work, Great Fundamentals","I have taken John Shank's required first year class at Babson College (MBA program, first year) and bought this for more background since he requires no textbook for the class. It takes much of Michael Porter's work and merges it with a cost accounting angle. The book was exactly the mix of Michael Porter and John Shank that Shank preaches in the classroom and is critical to a responsible understanding of any manufacturing-based operation. From my perspective, it is probably most useful to business operators/managers -- far more so than consultants. The sample cases are a good mix in their simplicity and relevance -- I will refer to the book for years to come.I bought it used through Amazon and paid about $10.00 -- it was promptly delivered in perfect condition."
4,Limited but interesting view of the subject,"I like this book - it takes an interesting perspective on the subject based on economic forces in the supply chain. While useful, it is not comprehensive and there are other aspects of strategic cost management that are not discussed. I use it but would not consider it as a sole text for a course in this area."
4,Tight Beats,"Bought this cd a while ago and it has aged nicely. They the trip-hop genre what it needs, more hiphop sounding track instead of the jazzy euro sound. Where's the new stuff????"
4,got to witness this,"A glorious rush of big tunes, surging choruses effervescent guitars and universal lyrics is how the movies/music mag uncut described 'under a sun' and i couldn't put it any better myself, fans of alt country bands like the jayhawks, golden smog and wilco should check this out. also worth checking out would be another english band by the name of grand drive and their debut 'road music' that could be described in exactly the same way."
2,VENT SHADE,"THE SHADES IN AND OF THEMSEVLES ARE FINE BUT THE REAR SHADES ARE WORTHLESS. THE REAR SHADES SHOULD BE CURVED LIKE THE FRONT ARE SO THEY COVER THE BACK HALF OF THE WINDOW WHEN YOU CRACK THEM OPEN. AS SOON AS YOU OPEN THE REAR, THE TOP PORTION IS PROTECTED BUT THE REAR SLOPING PORTION IS NOT AND THEREFORE YOU CAN'T CRACK THE REAR WINWOWS WHEN IT RAINS BECAUSE IT WILL RAIN RIGHT IN. SOMEONE REALLY MIS-ENGINEERED THIS ONE, BECAUSE NO ONE TOOK THE TIME TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION."
4,An original idea with clever dialogue and above average execution,"Mark Dunn has written a literal ""war of letters"". My only criticism is that the use of the ""letter"" format for communication gets strained and artificial at times during the story, but is a convenient plot device for demonstrating the inventive ways that people will adapt to opression and the eventual triumph of good sense.The book can be read in a couple of hours and is an amusing diversion. I strongly recommend it. The quality of the prose is high and the use of language is particularly clever when one remembers the constraints in which the author was working. A flawed masterpiece."
2,Contrived plot,"This book may have been better as a fairytale, then the contrived plot would not have detracted from the story. I bought it because of the high reviews on this site, and then felt like it was not what so many had raved about. I think the author just wanted the excuse to play with words, which he does well, but the need for a plot is a major factor in a well written book and this just doesn't work. An island with no technology--an idiot savant to read the letters--a group of leaders (not just one man)that are crazy, or cruel, or who knows what their motivation was? Just not that great of a book."
5,Original,"I really enjoyed this book. It is very intersting, you want to keep reading to see what will happen next, and how they will be able to get by as more and more letters get taken away. It was a fun read and keeps you thinking after the book has finished."
5,Quirky Satire,"I must say, I wasn't sure what to expect with this book- it was recommended by a friend and read on a whim. I'm happy to report that it was a complete pleasure.5 Stars- The satirical nature of government, community and religion are obvious and s very true.- The writing is fun, yet serious and thoughtful.- Dunn's characters are naive to the world, yet so keen in regards to knowing each other and knowing their own capabilities.- Quick read that never drags on.Only Critique- It did end neatly, as one knows it will from the beginning. It's not meant to be a tragedy, though, so I suppose I can get over it.I don't use this word often, given the fact that I'm about thirty years too young to do so, but Ella Minnow Pea is absolutely delightful."
3,It was okay,"The premise and the execution of the book were clever. However, about three fourths of the way through the book, I started feeling like I was reading more of the same. I also felt as though I never made a connection with the characters because the book was told in letters. I didn't hate it, but definately didn't love it."
5,Funny and Thought-Provoking,"This was an excellent book. The letter format made for quick reading while the subject kept you constantly thinking. I found myself trying to resolve the challenge set forth in the story before I allowed myself to read the end. Although the vocabulary is quite challenging, I am considering using this story with my middle school students. It is a great exericise in developing a broader vocabulary by learning terms in context. The story also created a sense of political awareness and caused me to ponder the needs of a successful society. This is a book that should not be missed."
4,Original and Entertaining,"What a great little gem this book is. Told through letters between the characters, the text gradually loses bits of the alphabet until Dunn must be extremely creative in word choice and spelling. Ella Minnow Pea is an easy read and very funny, but it also contains some food for thought on fanaticism and conformity, as well as the function of language as a tool for civilization. While the message is evident, it is thankfully not beaten to death in that ""look at me! I'm intellectual!"" way.This is one of those books that puts a smile on your face as you're reading because it's so clever in parts, and you'll be thinking about the implications long after you've finished."
4,Highly Enjoyable,"Quick read. I enjoyed the whimsical approach the author took to storytelling. Wish it could have been a little longer, but understand the limitations the author set upon himself."
2,OK as far as I got but...,"the Kindle version I downloaded kept crashing after I got about halfway through. After several failed attempts, I finally gave up trying to download a new version, and ended up asking for a refund, which Amazon provided."
5,"A fun, fast read","As an English major and lover of words, this book was a fun read for me. Also quite topical for today's political environment."
2,Nothing special,"I bought this book based on the overwhelming good reviews here, which I now feel are overstated. This is a very slight book that you can read in a couple of hours, and it is OK, nothing more. It is somewhat clever, but built around a cheap gimmick and as such is rather one dimensional. I might have given it three stars but I feel the need to counter all of the excessive praise."
2,"Contrived, perverse, and yet readable","In order to make the story work, so many bizarre assumptions had to be created that the whole thing feels very contrived. So it was very hard to read this book in the beginning, where all the contrivances were being laid out, particularly as they were laid out in an inelegant fashion. But once that was established, it was fairly good, not great, and something I did actually finish. Still, things were a bit too neat, everyone finding love and all that, the real baddies being deftly punished after realizing their failings, etc. Overall, I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but it was a relief to finish it. Books I really love leave me wishing they were longer."
3,a romp in letters!!,"...not onlee es thes book a romp, but et es a soseeal kommentaree on the abuse oph power."
3,Story featuring clever wordplay,"I read this story on recommendation from Nancy, but was ultimately a bit disappointed. The overview is that a small island nation gradually outlaws the letters of the alphabet, one-by-one. The story is told through a series of letters, which necessarily include fewer and fewer letters of the alphabet. I found the idea (of the disappearing letters) to be fascinating, but the execution to be only decent; further the flavor was a bit darker than I would expect from the whimsical concept. So, while I was entertained while reading, I would recommend this to someone only with reservations."
2,Ella Minnow Pea,"The book plot was novel; however far too preditable of an ending. The play on vocabulary was an intriguing puzzle at first, then became tiresome about half way through the book."
3,Quick Read,"It was a clever idea, but it just got old after a while. I suppose I am not the biggest fan of books being entirely made up of correspondance."
2,"Creative, but not very interesting","Ella Minnow Pea has a clever title, and in fact is very creatively written. I am sure it took hours of concentration to get everything right. And if you are interested in word play and word games, this is the book for you. The characters and the plot are just incidental. It could be a great allegory about Nazi Germany, but if it is, I missed it. If you are looking for a message or character development, this isn't the place."
5,"Should be on school's ""Summer Reading List""",This is a fun read as each letter disappears...the anticipation makes it creative and also a bit of a mystery. I think middle and high schoolers would enjoy and be challenged to think broadly when considering the possibilities. Only a few friends 'got' the title when I told them what I was reading....which made it even more fun! I wish I could say this of other Dunn books...but none meet the satisfaction of this one!
2,Deceived by the Cover,"The CD cover uses a photgraph from the early 1960s, giving the impression that it was recorded during the heyday of both Nelson Riddle and Rosemary Clooney. In fact, the CD was recorded in the mid 1990s. Rosemary's voice is not what it used to be and even though the overall effect of her singing and the arrangements is pleasant,it is not vintage Rosemary quality."
3,This is Old Rosie,I love Rosie but her voice now is not the voice of the young Rosie. I would like to know if there are any tapes or CDs of the original recordings. Can you help me?
2,There are better birddog books available.,This book is an o.k. read and offers some good information if you don't mind sifting through the outdated advice. (First Copyright in 1974).
2,Buy only if you plan to Hunt birds,Had I known that the book was written for bird hunters I would have saved myself the trouble.
5,I've been waiting (& hoping) for this Archives collection for years!,"I can't wait for this to come out! Though I liked the various main stream DC titles (Flash, Green Lantern & the Justice League) and unlike most who liked one or the other of the ""Top 2"" publshiers, I also liked Marvel and,for instance, its ""big guns:"" the Fantastic Four & Spider-Man.However, I always had a soft spot for DC's more ""quirky"" titles - the Doom Patrol, Eclipso, Metamorpho, and, not least, Doc Magnus & his very human band of robots - the Metal Men.So, I've been waiting for years for this to come out, hoping DC would eventually put out an Archive collection or maybe a ""Showcase Presents"" black and white collection of their adventures.My wife never bought and read comics as a child but can remember enjoying her brother's comics about the Metal Men - she's looking forward to reading it too!Without wishing to sound greedy, may I next hope for an Eclipso collection...?"
5,Mind in the Making,"I read Robinson's book for freshman English in 1959, and I still remember the author's name and the title of the book. However, the content now (2012) eludes me. I do know, however, that I had underlined all the words I did not know, and when I read the book 20 years later (it's now lost) I was amazed how many words that are now part of my speaking vocabulary that I did not know."
4,Seminal book,"First read it in college in the early 60's, great insight into how to intrepret modern media manipulation."
4,"hilarious, disturbing, enthralling","Waters is one of those quirky entertainers, you either love him or hate him. If you like demented entertainment, you will eat this up.Chapters 1,5,6,7,10, and 12 had me laughing so hard my stomach hurt.Waters is the master of filth but he makes it so damn enjoyable, and often times its uncomfortable but you just cant stop reading.This is a welcome break from the ""best sellers"".Surprise mom and dad with this for Christmas or an anniversary gift."
4,Its the Boss!,"Mel Torme's collaboration with Rob McConnell et al is terrific. I've listened to a great deal of Mel Torme' over the past 17 years (even had the opportunity to see him live in ' 87), and I personally love his 'older' voice the best. Songs like 'Love Walked In,' 'I Get A Kick Out Of You,' and 'Liza' showcase his talent. Rob McConnell's Boss Brass are really kickin' it too! Enjoy this one while you're hanging around the house."
3,A GREAT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT BOOK,How did Elizabeth Noble conceive with a sperm donor she knew but without having sex with him? How did her family feel about it? This is an thought provoking book which not only tells Noble's story but has an interesting chapter on donor offspring and their reactions at learning as adults that they have biological fathers who are not the fathers they grew up with. While this is a good book I would also recommend to anyone planning to by this book to also buy Helping the Stork: The Choices and Challenges of Donor Insemination by Vercollone. Vercollone's book helps you discuss DI with your donor offspring so they don't become bitter...which was Noble's experience.
1,Terrible INSENSITIVE HORRIBLE book,"This is a terrible book. It refers to children by DI as ""illegitimate"" and compares donor insemination to adultery. Its a terrible book and I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,DONT BELIVE THE HYPE,this dj totaly needs to step his game up.legends like T.I & JAY-Z should not of let this mixtape go down the way it did.what a shame.do not buy it.
1,Dont buy this unless you already can sing,If zero stars was an option I would have chosen it. This cd does not in any way show the listener how to pick out harmony parts. The parts are all sung simultaneously and you have no idea how they were constructed or even what the harmony parts are by themselves. This is by far the worst musical purchase I have ever made and I do have quite a collection of musical texts and cd's. If you are eager to learn how to harmonize this book simply is too complicated and noy well thought out. This cd seems more like a showcase for the authors ability which does the buyer absolutely no good.
1,jus stop alrdy,"ok ive hated lil romeo ever since he came. the kid thinks hes his father. im not here 2 reveiw this album, 2 reveiw this artisit. i truly did not even bother buyin this slabum i downloaded a few tracks..and they all sucked. hes a pop star not an MC. wen u got a frekain show on a kids channel where u freestyle sum white grl, ur a pop star not an MC. Pick up Bow Wows new album hes become a real MC as the years went by. If u lookin for a good derty south artist dont even look here. chec out Ludacris, David Banner, Lil' Flip, Lil' Jon, Trillville, Webbie, MAster P, Bow Wow, Trick Daddy, Lil' Scrappy, Young Buck, D-Tay, Stat Quo, UGK, TI, Mannie Fresh, Birdman, Lil'Wayne, Juvenile, BG, Ying Yang Twins, Pitbull, pretty much any one but this loser. he cant rap fo nuttin."
1,IT SUCKS,"LIL ROMEO U NEED 2 GO SOMEWHERE BECAUSE BOWWOW IS WHATZ HAPPENING SO JUST MOVE WITH YOUR FAKE HAIR ON YOUR LIP OK AND IF U WHAT TO BECOME A LITTLE BIGGER TAKE OFF THE LIL GET IT , GOT IT, GOOD! MAKE A NEW ALBUM PLEASE IT SUCKED"
1,naw! this aint happenin',"you wud think that romeo wud grow up and be like super good by now, but still at 15 years old, he still makin songs like he's 11, this cd is isnt all that great, the only good song is his first single, my cinde3rella..everything else, is just basically bunk, just don't waste your money on this crap!"
1,Worst rapper ever,"This kid makes Vanilla Ice look like Tupac. Oh yeah he's that bad. He's nothing more but a male version of Hillary Duff. He's a pop singer and a crappy one at that. All he does is sing about Cinderella and his girlfriend that probably doesn't exist. Everything about this album is bad. Stupid, poorly written, and bubblegum lyrics, corny beats, and bad flow. By far the worst rap album of last year. It makes J-Kwon's album look like Straight Outta Compton."
1,Where is a father figure?,I thought father's were supposed to direct their children in the right diretion and teach them to do right? Well Master P is teaching Romeo to be as wack as he can be. Hell he stooped even lower and is gonna make romeo even wacker than he ever could be. We must stop this vicious cycle now as consumers. Booo this kid off stage and encourage him to read a book.
4,HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes ladies and germs Romeo is back with a great new album ROMEOLAND. With beats from the Master. Master P he's father, Nick Cannon, among others. Best Song on the cd is My Cinderella. Bottom line is a other great ablum from LIL ROMEO."
1,Don't like him,I personally don't like Lil' Romeo or Master P. I don't think he's a good rapper and he should leave the music industry.
1,I totally agree!,"I totally agree with Nemo the Clownfish and the Teenage Soul about this album. Lil' Romeo sucks and noone reliazes it. Sure Lil' Romeo has a TV show, but haven't you noticed the episodes are so ridculously idiotic? Lil' Bow Wow doesn't have a TV show because he is one step up...MOVIES! The only movies I've ever seen Romeo in were as stupid as his show. Plus, another agreement with Teenage Soul, Koch is the worst record company and I'm glad Romeo is in it, because he's with other stupid artists like William Hung, Strawberry Shortcake, and Barbie. So, that explains it, DON'T BUY!"
2,The theorem underdone...,"While doing my best to follow the maths & become educated, I was horrified by the lax authorial attitude towards food & cooking.Describing ancient greek mathmaticians drinking ouzo while eating calamari & tomato, the narrating character allows that they may not have drunk ouzo, but overlooks the minor fact that tomatoes are a new world fruit & were unknown to the ancient greeks.Later, as the cast sits down to dinner, a bottle of chianti that has been chilling on the balcony is fetched. Why are they chilling what is almost certainly a red chianti?That meant I stopped reading at page 128, returned the book to the library, and had a little lie down. If the author is trying to be learned, he cannot be so ignorant in other areas, it lets the side down.And knowing about food, drink, and cooking is perhaps more fun than knowing how to determine the volume of a true cone."
5,A wonderful book about Maths for everyone. Not to be missed!,"What a book! The story is fascinating, the characters are unusual and it is very well written! Every single page I went through was a delight .The book creates a comfort and nice atmosphere for those who hate maths. It is an adventure that makes you keep your attention to the very end. I strongly recommend this book for all Maths lovers, students, and those who have difficulties with the subject since it might open their minds to a new and enchanting world!"
2,Children's book,"This book is for kids. The book tries to generate excitement using math but fails miserably since the level of math is elementary. e.g mom calculates 1/4 +1/3+1/2 =13/12.. son says .. ""wow! thats cool"". What rubbish!"
3,Taladro/Drill,"el taladro está perfecto me gusta mucho., pero el estuche donde vino es de tela., no fue el estuche que pensé estaba comprando osea queria mi caja de plastico."
4,Some Bitter Readers . . .,"Wow, seems like some reviewers are really upset that this book doesn't provide a comprehensive conversion/education. I found it to be an interesting allegorical juxtapostion of Christianity with a popular movie, and a thought provoking way to harness the appeal of an approchable popular mythos to invigorate an occasionally staid and lethargic sprituality.But what do I know . . .?"
1,Sad,"I love Greg Boyd - I loved ""God of the Possible"", I love hispodcast, I love this theology.... let's get that down right offthe bat. I am not some closed-minded fundie.This book, however, is terrible.Not because it is dangerous, or bad theology....Because it is just plain corny.When the book asked me what my thought ""smelled"" like or felt likewas it soft or hard - I felt like I was at a new-age pagan drum circle...Making up stuff in your head won't help fight the war - the war isreal. Demons are real.Just avoid this book. Get his other books, listen to his podcast,just leave the creative visualization to the weekend witches andwizards at the local occult book store."
1,Your Mind Is Already Free Per the Mind of Christ!,Promotes mischief alerted minds dismiss. Use all precautions in escaping this!
4,Great Sounds,My Baby relaxes when we have this CD is played at night as we try to wind down the day and get ready for sleep.
1,Katie's a bore!,The acting was poor especially the actress who portrayed Katie. I was grateful when the movie ended. I kept hoping the movie would become relevant as the minutes passed however it ended like it started....meaningless! Don't waste your time.
5,Kahlil Gibran The Man & His Work,"The DVD on Kahlil Gibran is a complete and well done biography on this important writer. By viewing his life, we get a better understanding of his body of work.It is a must see for Gibran fans!"
1,What a bloated book!,"This book quickly hits rock bottom then digs all new lows! It's an extremely wordy non-account of the death of a California student. I say non-account because a majority of the book is a digest of the writers emotional rollercoaster as she lives through the death of a friend. Too much time is spent on her and not enough time is spent on the real story, Roberta Lee. The cover boldly proclaims ""Better than In Cold Blood"", a quote from Harold Brodkey. Apparently Brodkey has never read this good work by Truman Capote or he wouldn't have made a statement like that. Save your money and read the back cover. You'll learn the whole story quicker that way."
2,I remember this murder...,"I was living in the Bay Area at the time when this happened and remember seeing the articles in the paper and the clips on the news about the search, arrest and conviction.But wow, this book was really helpful for helping me get to sleep at night! Very long and drawn out.And I was pretty disappointed to learn that Bibi's family refused to let the author use any actual letters from Bibi for her book and the author just wrote all these fake ones for it.A disappointment, especially after following this story in the news.She left out the part where Bradley Pages returned to the body and had sex with it a few times."
2,JOURNAL OF SORROW,"Roberta ""Bibi"" Lee was murdered by her boyfriend in 1984. She was a close friend of the author and this book is about her murder and subsequent trial and sentence of the boyfriend.Melanie Thernstrom does a sterling job of researching Bibi's murder and including letters that, according to her, ""sound like what Bibi would have written."" The only drawback is that this book is very verbose and could have been cut down in places.I also felt the author's description of her devastation over her break up with her boyfriend Adam was extraneous. As bad as one felt for the author, her love life really had nothing to do with Bibi.It is to Ms. Thernstrom's credit that she cared so much about Bibi that this book was ever written. It is a loving testamony to the strong bonds of friendship. Had this book been less verbose, it would have gotten more stars."
2,This isn't a True Crime Book,"If you are hoping for a true crime story, you will be dissappointed (and probably annoyed) by this book. I wish someone would write a true crime book about this particular murder, but unfortunately The Dead Girl is more of a long, self indulgent journal entry- I learned way too much about the author's own emptiness and overly abstract,needy, and self-referential thinking style and not enough about the tragedy the book was purportedly about.I read the first third, skimmed the second, and then skipped to the epilogue. Ms. Thernstrom's other book, Halfway Heaven, however, is BRILLIANT and a must read for true crime fans!"
5,Great Value!,"I searched for this product for quite a long time. I was very excited to find it on Amazon. The CD was in excellent shape, and was a tremendous value. I won't hesitate to use this service again."
5,This is Real Country,"If you want to listen to some good contemporary country music, then ""Light At The End Of The Tunnel"" is the CD for you. There is nothing better than firing up the grill: crackin a can of beer, and listening to some B.B. Watson on a warm summer nite.If you like real head bobbin, foot tappin music; you need not look any farther. This CD is all you need."
5,My favorite instrumental track ever!,"I loved this CD so much, I borrowed it from my roommate permanently. This is some of the most soothing instrumental music I've ever heard, and it is so wonderful to play on a cool morning; you can really imagine yourself starting out on a path in a thick wood, crossing a bridge over a chuckling brook, meeting up with a black haired lass, and watching the stars come out above the hills as darkness falls softly around you. I don't know much about ""celtic"" music, but the combination of piano, pipes, and violin is very moving, and I wish I could find more music like this. I listen to the CD several times a week and always look forward to coming back for more."
5,Get this CD now!!,"Wow... this CD rocks. Although I was hoping Sicboy would come out with a full length album, Tease will just have to do for now. This is 4 incredibly tight songs, with some awesome production. Why this band isn't on a major is beyond me... I could easily hear any of these tracks on the radio. An excellent job, and I see great things happening for this band in the near future."
5,Second CD by a great group,This CD is definitely worth getting. I got it right when it came out and each track got better then the one before it. Definitely cool.
4,"Proven, yet again","Sicboy proves once again that there is much more talent in local music scenes than in mainstream rock nowadays. Evolving quite a bit from their debut release, Artificial Flavors, a mere 10 second listen from the first two tracks proves the talent that lies within this Connecticut band. Able to be heavy with the best of them, and then to dark and melodic says that Sicboy definatley does not carry the same exact sound for each song, which is the case with mainstream rock this day and age. Want a band that utilizes their many talents to the fullest? Pick up Tease."
5,They back it up,"I found out about Sicboy since they're from my area, and they promote the hell out of themselves. I know they've received some criticism for the way they promote themselves and what not... and I was a bit skeptical about checking them out. But you know what, I bit the bullet, check out some of their music, and they honestly deliver the goods. These guys can rock, and rock hard. I got both this EP and the 2004 EP, and both are solid examples of original Hard Rock that simply kicks butt! I highly recommend you check them out, and do what I did, and give them a chance. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Leaves you wanting more.,"I found siege of shadows to be entertaining, cant put it down reading. It left you at the end eagerly awaiting the sequel, which never showed up. Well developed charactors with an interesting storyline.....but what happens next ?"
5,I HIGHLY recommend this book!!!!,"This is a fabulous book...the best I've read on practical tips for child training. This is about raising respectible, obedient, HAPPY and godly children. I have used many of the tips with my children. The principles work and my children are thriving knowing legitimate boundaries and proper behavior. I HIGHLY recommend this book to young parents."
5,The best child-rearing advice I've seen yet,"If you're looking for a Bible-based book on raising your children, this is it! Reb Bradley gives scripture references through out the book to support his views and methods. He also tells the reader when a particular point is soley his view based on his observations and experience.One of the best things about this book is the way the author steps on your toes. He gives specific examples of things we (parents)do to encourage our children to misbehave, as well as examples of things that we may not recognize as misbehavior.If you think you're doing a good job of raising your kids, read this book. I keep one to refer to now and then, but I keep giving it away to people who are impressed with my kids behavior! I'm ordering five more!"
5,Child Training Tips: What I Wish I Knew When My Children Were Young,"Child Training Tips: What I Wish I Knew When My Children Were Young (Revised Edition 1998)Don't know what book the 1 star raters read, but they sure didn't read this one. My guess it can from this link[...]Those reviewing from this link proly have the kids that are out of comtrol you see in stores and restaurants.These tips worked wonderfull in my home. Not to say all the tips are the best for your situation, but many are."
1,Child abuse dressed up as discipline,"This is one of the nastier books around. Systematic child abuse, demonising of babies and a series of techniques guaranteed to produce neurotic, distressed teens and adults. The techniques advocated here are nothing short of sick, and do more to reflect a basic insecurity on the part of the author than they do a realistic, sensible manual for raising a child.When an author believes a baby is capable of ""defying"" a parent simply by wanting to get down and play, something is very wrong with that parent's sense of self-worth. Bradley seems to have done nothing more than externalise his own prejudices and fears and dressed it up as a useful resource for parents."
2,not sure about this one,"This book has me feeling a little uncomfortable. I was never hit as a child and I do have a lot of self discipline problems that I don't wish upon my child, but I really have a problem with ""chastizing"" (spanking my baby with a light rod) whenever she steps out of line. The ladder (according to reb) would be damning my childs soul and body to hell forever... It just doesnt sit right with me and I wish I had never picked it up."
1,Too harsh,"It seemed to me that the author's approach produces a child's obedience much like what I would describe as a dog's submissiveness. It appears that a child can't approach their parent unless their head is bowed and their tail between their legs. Even the picture on the book doesn't look like a happy child to me, but one who is timid. I do agree that children need consistently enforced boundaries, but some psychological liberty with it. I much preferred ""Love and Logic"" by Jim Faye."
1,Sad people blindly follow false interpretations.,"This books tells not to allow inappropriate language in the home. It also suggests the parents call the children inappropriate demeaning names. Isn't the number one rule of parenting that children learn what they see. If a parent is calling the child a little beast, that what they'll think they are, and that's what they'll learn to call others. Basic parenting 101 out the door. Children are not puppets to be controlled, but small people who need to learn. Discipline does not mean ""chastising"", but it means to teach. Also, not hitting your children and choosing not to have them be little puppets does not mean they walk all over the parent and have no rules as another reader suggested. My children have wonderful manners, yet the methods in this book seem like a hitler regime to me. I am not raising a nazi, but a child."
1,"Pure Child abuse, horrible",This book is horrible. It is purely describing how to physically and mentally abuse children until they are numb. Its unbelievable that these books actually get written and sold.The book states that children are never to young to use the rod for whipping them.It quotes all the negative pieces that can be found in the bible to an extend which is totally sick. But it forgets to state all the huge pieces on mercy & forgiveness and kindness to children as per Jesus words.To me it clearly states that the writer fully misunderstood the bible and has no sense on children and how to care for them.Its totally appaling and I cannot stress enough to not buy it or use these ways.
1,Child Abuse Wearing a Bible Mask!,"This book as well as others that suggest spanking and using the rod on children are blasphemous in the face of Jesus! Isn't it interesting to note that violence is increasing in our country everywhere and these terrible tomes appear in the middle of this very negative movement. Please remove these kinds of books from your lists.Jerry Townsend, School Psychologist (retired), Christian Minister (retired)"
1,This is sick!,Anyone who treats children in the manner recommended in this book should be arrested for child abuse. The only word for it is: detestable.
1,"Weak Willed Mommies, Unite!","I feel terrible sorrow for mothers, fathers and children who see no other recourse than the methodology of this book.Why not read, ""For Her Own Good,"" and see the tragic history of men who appeal to women to forget their perfect instinct in raising children."
1,Child-abuse manual,"This book is disgusting. It advocates whipping and hair-pulling, degrading remarks and other depraved punishments for children as young as one year! And as for others who say that it works; of course it does! I would behave beautifully if I lived in constant fear for my physical and psychological health and safety, if I did not behave!"
1,Horrified by this book,"I am a mother of a wonderful 4 year old boy. After reading the reviews for this book, I have absolutely no interest in reading it. I want my son to grow up happy and well adjusted, and to know how to love. He is a very loving child, always ready with a hug and kiss for those close to him. I don not want to dominate or control my son, I want to teach him right from wrong. I do not see the logic in telling him it's not ok to hit his friends at daycare, then turn around and spank him at home? Hitting is either ok all the time or it's not. How anyone can write a book like this and say it is in the name of God...this baffles me."
1,Total Lack of Grace and Respect for God,God made each of us unique. Yet these authors want us to force our children into a mold.God forgives us endlessly and blesses us beyond our wildest dreams. Yet these authors have us treat our children as if they don't deserve grace and tells us to make them earn their blessings.I'm thankful God doesn't parent His children the way these authors tell us to parent. We are to model Christ for our children. This book tells you to do the exact opposite.Biblical Parenting by Crystal Lutton is a much better book.
1,Not as described online,"The description said the book was new. It was not. Inside was an inscription from one person to another. since I was not buying it as a gift, I just kept it, but was very dissapointed that it was not as described...it was not new. Makes me uncomfortable in ordering from you again.Paula Hammond"
1,"disgusting, horrible","Wow, I amazed someone has the gall to write a book like this. Would've given it NO Stars if I could. It's pretty sad when someone uses the Bible as a reason to hit another person, especially a child. Don't I remember from Church that Jesus preached about mercy and forgiveness? Don't hear that anywhere in this book. Very, very sad. I will pray for those children who have parents that actually read and follow through with the disgusting advice in this book."
1,GROSS,"How can any normal person hit a teeny baby. This book is very sick, who wants to become a control freak and terrorize their kids and never allow them to talk and starve them. This book should be called TIPS ON GETTING YOUR CHILD TO HATE YOU. Amazon should stop selling this child abuse stuff I thought this was against the law!"
1,This book should be taken off of this site!!,"Child rearing or child abuse?? This book's contents sicken me and should sicken anyone who really loves their children. People that write these kinds of books have to be demented, as well as child abusers!"
1,Amazon profits from child abuse,"Calling children derogatory names. Making them go hungry. Forcing them to eat food they don't want. Beating infants with sticks. Whipping until they're totally submissive. Beating them more if they cry from the pain. Even the cover of the book shows a tiny child cowering, her soul crushed. It's nauseating.Why does Amazon continue to sell and promote child abuse? Why?"
1,I Give This Book 5 Millstones!,"Jesus said this about himself: The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. Matthew 12:42So if Jesus' wisdom is greater than Solomon's, shouldn't Christians listen to what Jesus said about child rearing and not Solomon? All the child beating advice in the Bible comes from King Solomon. He beat his son and he turned out OK, Right? Rehoboam became a lousy leader and an idol worshipper. So much for Solomon's great advice!Now for Jesus' advice: ""And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."" Mark 9:42. Jesus obviously never had children, but if He did, would anyone think that he would beat them? He would have had to tie a millstone around his own neck if he did!"
1,This nook violates Amazon's Offensive Materials Policy,"As one reviewer said:""It's just a travesty that Amazon continues to profit from these grotesque child abuse manuals!! And doing so gives ""legitimacy"" to these baby-whipping books, so parents continue to think the advice is OK..."""
2,Not a Very Good Thinker,"Yes it may be a good introduction to some thought;yes it gives good references to some other material to consider; but it is consistently disappointing and laughable inanti-american, anti-israel, and anti-catholic bias. Appears to be written by authors who know some philosophy and religion but are clueless in history and politics (except where modernuniversity pc may be unthinkingly substituted)"
2,Good sound quality but it was just a copied CD,"When I bought this, the seller's listing said it was 'new.' For me, 'new' means 'original'. Unfortunately not the case here. While the CD had the track listings printed on the disc, the songs do NOT show up on other media such as iPods and other media. I've kept the CD but complete truth in advertising would be greatly appreciated."
5,This book is the real deal.,"N.Y. City, December 1998. I have read this book for over the past 15 years and has brought about cures of many different physical aliments that I have had during that period of my life"
5,"It's Only Rock and Roll, But I Like It","""Wendy Mullen is probably the world's leading expert on Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones. She writes with humor, intelligence, insight and a cinematic eye for detail. She brings the knowledge of a scholar and the passion of a rock and roller to her work. Any fan of the Stones, or anyone with an interest in popular culture, will enjoy this delightful book.Eric Hamburg, author of ""JFK, Nixon, Oliver Stone and Me"""
5,SPOILER ALERT - Konrad Baumeister review,The Konrad Baumeister review gives away the ending. Do not read the 4th paragraph if you intend to read the book -- which you should.
3,VERY good but.....,"I watched this when it orginally aired and Tivo'd it..I HAD read Barbra had sat there for an 6 hour interview and they cut it down to ONE HOUR,,SO I was hoping that when they released the DVD they would add a lot more footage they had cut out...WRONG...:( I was so disappointed the same hour cut they used for tv...STILL.. all in all a GREAT interview to watch..."
4,Worth a listen,"Hornsby laces his signature piano thru themes of change and loss in the most melodious effort in some time. His irreverent sense of humor shines through as he doubts and questions life's little mysteries. Accompanied by his fellow musicians, Clapton,Sting and John, Hornsby proves he's got the chops. We will always have the radio hits but it's reassuring to know Hornsby doesn't rest on his laurels. He continues to experiment with ""his"" sound. There may not be a radio hit among these latest efforts, but it's definitely worth the listen and addition to a collection."
3,"Back on the right track, but...","I expect this disk will grow on me, just as Spirit Trial did. And in my opinion this puts Bruce back on the right track (after Big Swing Face). But I could not help but think of what Emperor Joseph remarked after hearing a personal performance of a new opera by Mozart in Amadeus: ""Too many notes."" Except in the case of Halcyon Days (and other BH disks as well), it's ""Too many words."" Bruce writes and performs great tunes. But he is not a great lyricist, except on rare occasions. And yet he insists upon loading up some of his best tunes with so many words that, in my opinion, the songs collapse under the weight of it all. I think his very best work has been when he kept the lyrics simple and allowed them to ""punctuate"" the melody. I'm a fan and I wish Bruce would take a lesson or two in Less is More when it comes to his lyrics."
2,very talented cat who might be spent,I always have dug Bruce Hornsby style of playing the piano&setting up a story line but after hearing His past few Discs&this one you can hear an Artist still trying to crack that One More Hit that just ain't there despite some good material scattered about.this album seems directionless in some ways.now Hornsby is a Underrated Artist no doubt but this album is the kind that will further keep him that way sad to say.
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"With the exception of maybe two cuts, this is boring. Bruce is a fine talent and very gifted, but the well has run dry. I just can't get into this repetitive piano driven stuff. Nothing insightful like ""The Way It Is""."
1,what the hell happened?,"I've been a Bruce Hornsby fan ever since his first album. I can't say that I'm a fan of this latest effort. The best songs here (Gonna Be Some Changes, Candy Mountain Run) have a tough time competing with the mediocre songs of the past. Maybe it's time to take a break. I know I won't be buying this CD until I see it in the used bin for a dollar or two.I'm going to wait for somthing that ranks up there with Spirit Trail or Harbor Lights."
4,Great HRM for price,"I wanted to more accurately record the calories I consumed and burned so I decided to get an HRM. I wanted one with a chest strap because they are more accurate, and I wanted one that had more features than the cheapo ones but not as many as the super-whamidine ones that look like mini computers on people's wrists. Long story short, this is just what I was looking for. My only complaint is I wish it had an audible alert when in workout mode telling you that it isn't getting a good signal from the chest strap. Sometimes when I'm running I'll look at my watch and see I've been going for like 1/2 a mile with no signal and no calories/heart rate being calculated. This alert could also let you know when the signal is getting weaker (maybe a signal strength meter that gives an audible alert when it's 2 bars or less) so you know it's time to change your chest strap battery. besides that, great HRM. I use it every time I workout or play a sport."
3,Works well but...,"No issues. Works well, but won't send a signal that the treadmill in my club can read so I still have to hold the rails to get a heart rate. Disappointing. Apparently the club equipment will only work with a Polar heart monitor."
1,Poor excuse for a Runner's Watch,"Got the N5 for a birthday present. Never could get the heart rate monitor to work. Operation Guide refences wetting two electrodes but none are visible. Ran three miles and worked up a good sweat and still no heart rate. Instead use the Chronograph like my IronMan Timex. However - NO WAY TO READ BACK YOUR SPLIT TIMES! Whaaa?? NewBalance website has a flaw and no way to get to the N5 description directly. Have to go to the store so no additional information is available. It would be nice to have some background on how to effectively use all of the features. The Operation Guide only shows you how to push buttons. On the positive side, nice big characters - easy to read while running. That is about all...."
1,Terrible translation,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. The material presented here is interesting, but the translation is extremely faulty. Mr. Huizinga has made errors which should never have gotten past the editor."
2,I expected better,The music is okay but the quality of sound is not very good. They took live recordings from Steeltown show and put them on here. i had hoped the being dvd audio the quality would have been better! It's not..The new Lynyrd Skynyrd mixed by Elliot Shiner are the original studio recordings and are far superior to this one. This one is barely acceptable.
2,Let-Down,The style of the champion shorts was not quite what i wanted...would've liked them a lot better if they had a draw string cause elastic was somewhat gappy. Also the style was a little shorter than it used to be a couple of years ago and wish the other style was offered as well. Also was not fond of the lining and the outter mesh being separate..in almost like a reversable style but not...the over product was pretty disappointing since champion shorts are non existent in stores and i know what style i like.
2,Not as pictured...,"I can see sizing being off a little, but the person modeling these must be a really thin teenager. I always wear a medium in champions and these are small in every dimension. Forget the nicely drapped appearance. These cling to my thighs, which while not small, aren't huge either. They also seem much shorter than the picture and with the waistband turned down would sit a good ways below my navel. Since I got them mostly to work out at home, I won't bother to return them, but they are much too small to wear to the gym. In my opinion this is not a woman's size but a ""juniors cut."""
1,shorts,You need to list if any of these short have side pockets big enough for tennis ball...have not bought any cause you do not state if any of the shorts have side tennis ball pockets...
5,Would buy again,"Fits nice, good length (not some super short shorts). They are comfortable, and breath well. No complaints, considering buying another pair."
5,comfortable and light,"I like these shorts, they keep me cool and are comfortable during my workout. The fabric is light. Pretty good overall."
3,A little cheap but fine for workouts,"These are okay shorts. If you plan to work out all the time in them, I would reconsider. They don't have a drawstring so I wonder how long the elastic will last for frequent washing. They fit fine however and don't show through."
3,Scala 500 is just ok,"I had one of these and liked it quite well so bought a 2nd one after I lost the first one. Second one never seemed to work very well. Found the first one lying in my driveway a month later. It had damage but still works better than the 2nd one. Complaints: cuts out a lot (people complain that they can't hear me); blinks blue all the time, not just when on a call; holder is useless - put it in your pocket or keep it on the ear. Pluses: lightweight, comfortable, versatile, good battery life."
4,"Not what they said, but ok","I got this because of the 'wind reduction.' I do alot of bike riding and wanted something so that people on the other end can hear me, not..well, you get the point. There was even a recording of what other blue tooth headsets sound like while bike riding, and what this is supposed to sound like. I was pretty disappointed, first time out all my friend heard was noise and not me. Other than that, it's a pretty good set up. It looks good and I don't feel like an automoton walking around. I like the fact that there is no name on it, since I wear it on my left ear. With a written name it would be upside down there. I'd somewhat recommend this, but not for the advertised noise reduction. It has an optional silicon ear piece extension, I would get that, mine didn't have it. I like the clip and lanyard that came with it, nice that it's included."
4,This is one you need to try,"With bluetooth headsets, there is much to be said about individual comfort and I have found this Cardo to be very comfortable for me. It functions very well also."
2,You Can Do Better Than This,"I got this headset about 6 months ago. It worked fairly well for the first four months, although the volume control was somewhat erratic -- nothing that I couldn't live with. However, in the past two months the bluetooth connection drops out unpredictably even though the phone is no more than three feet away at all times. I know that it's not the phone (LG enV) since the connection between it and my Motorola stereo headset never drops.Aside from that (which is a deal breaker in my book: if I had known that this would happen, I never would have bought this headset), the earpiece is fairly flimsy. I haven't broken it, but I've come close several times. I also noticed that the price on this headset has gone way up since I bought it at $29.99. Why? -- I couldn't tell you. But it's not worth it -- for $43, you can do a whole lot better."
3,U2 said it best...,"I still haven't found what I'm looking for. Specifically, I am looking for a bluetooth headset that works well. This is my third headset. Out of the box it looked great. Fits well on the ears. Easy to use. Great price. Holds long charge.Then the complaints started. While I can hear fine, the people on the other end of the conversation cannot. I might just use this solely for online PS3 gaming, IF they can hear me as well.The other two BT headsets I have used are the Motorola 500 and 850. The 500 is a cheap but efficient headset. It works fine, but the sound quality is not in the same ballpark as the 850. My 850 was great, but I have problems connecting the charger.So, I am still looking for the right BT. Any suggestions?"
2,terrible product,"constantly had problems with the pronunciation of who i was trying to call.big problem when driving!!!! didnt use it for a while, now it doesnt recharge or charge at all"
3,not so great,"I got this headset to replace aPlantronics Explorer 330 Easy-To-Use Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phonesthat I washed(which was fantastic btw). Over all the functioning is fine. The wind control does not really work but the sound is generally clear and the battery life is good. However, the earpiece is very uncomfortable it is loose and feels like it is going to fall off. Its ok for short-term use but not something you can really wear for any length of time for example when you are not actually on the phone. I am currently looking into other options because I do not use this headset. It is more convenient to not use a headset at all than to use this one."
4,Good Product for the Price,"Had this unit for a few weeks now - previously had 2 Motorola units. It connects readily with my ""Q"" (much better than the Motorolas did). Construction is a little cheap & cheerful but it is lightweight and sits comfortably on the ear. Lanyard & hoslter great ideas if you are inclined to lose/misplace things (fate of my last motorola bluetooth). Wind guard technology seems to work also.Negatives - call button stands out and is easily pressed accidentally. Max volume just about OK would appreciate more range. Callers say sounds a little hollow/tinny in use. The 'silicon cap' referred to instructions is not supplied you have to ask them for this (they sent me one on request).Overall rating good for the price and value for money."
4,Cardo Systems scala-500 Bluetooth Headset,Not a bad headset. Works well with Cingular 8125 PDA. Long standby and talk time.
2,Rancid product,"I've opened 4 of the 8 packages of Greenies, one was rancid. My cat started vomiting after eating the Salmon Greenies. I compared them with another package only to find that they had yellow-orange spots instead of being entirely green. I smelled them and they smelled different too. Normally Greenies are great treats for my cats but rancid products are not acceptable. EntirelyPets and other suppliers have to be aware of the age of the product they are selling according to when they buy it fromGreenies. I could not find an expiration date on the packages. Greenies is manufactured by S&M; Nutec and they should be providing expiration dates."
1,I thought they were great until I learned about menadione sodium bisulfite,"Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of ""Greenies"" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as ""source of vitamin k activity.""Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful."
5,Feline Greenies Variety Pack,"I have 8 cats, they are between the ages of 3 years and 5 years. I have bought them different treats from time to time and some will like them and some of my cats won't. Then I bought ""Greenies"" and all my cats love them, even Freeway. He got his name because he was found on the Freeway by Caltrans, he was just a kitten. Needless to say he is very timid but ""Greenies"" has brought him out of his shell. He even takes them from my fingers. I keep the ""Greenies"" in a cupboard under the TV and all the cats come running from everywhere if they hear that cupboard door open. I feel like the Pied Piper with ""Greenies"". My best friend loves her cats too so I gave her some ""Greenies"" for them. My cats. Toes, Ralf. Chip, Missy, Peanut, Thomas, Freeway and William all recommend ""Greenies"" for your cats. Plus they keep your cat's teeth clean too!"
5,Her favorite!!!!,I got my kittie a free sample of Greenies and she loved them! HOWEVER - I could not find them in any store so she did without. I stumbled upon them at Amazon.com (I should have known!!!) and was able to get them for her. I have one EXTREMELY happy kittie. She just LOVES them!! From now on I will just come here to order them again and again.....
5,This May or May Not Be So...,"The review below says that the ingredients are not digestible. It is not clear if they are talking about feline or canine greenies, AND in my esperience, both my dogs and cats have digested their respective greenies ""just fine."" My elderly male cat loves the salmon flavor, and I've often used them to keep his appetite ""perked up."" Decide for yourself. Try samples of the Greenies products out and observe your animals."
3,cat loves 'em,"I don't particularly care for this particular seller, however. Delivery was SLOOOOOOOW.My cat loves these treats but she tends to scarf them, pretty much negating the point of them. I don't buy them for her too often any more since they don't do anything for her teeth if she swallows them whole.It would be helpful if they were somewhat larger. I give her Science Diet dental dry food now, instead."
3,"what's the difference between a ""treat"" and ""dental treat""","My cats swallow them without chewing. I guess if they make it a little bigger the cats might want to chew on it? So it defeats the dental cleaning purpose and I view it as a regular treat, although much more expensive.The good thing about it is it really smells good and my cats love it (hence the swallowing...)"
4,insightful,"For any one curious on the history and the development of neuabeuten's sound this is a very good place to start, Filled with interviews with band memberspast and present and people who worked with them including Stevo and Nick Cave. Worth getting for live footage including clips from the 80's as well as an bonus feature which includes the recording of songs from Silence is Sexy.The interviews provide a few nuggets of informance, insights in to the bands personalities but it is the archieve live clips make it looking at."
1,Fouled my pond,"This product turned my pond milky and created pockets of bubbles on the surface. It took many days to clear. The manufacturer did return my call regarding the failure of this product but they said it was due to my particular water conditions. NOWHERE on their own website, nor on their Amazon description, was there ANY warning about a specific, necessary water chemistry for this product to perform as advertised. While the maufacturer's rep answered my questions he did not show any concern or care about the situation. Even after I explained to him that I had used their enzyme products for nine years.I rely heavily on the reviews here and hope to help others avoid wasting their money. The maufacturer refused to refund the price of the product to me."
1,Outdated 1876 Book,"I was looking for a modern guide of current social etiquette and dress codes. When I received it, to my shock, I learned that this was an 1876 outdated book that was totally useless to me."
2,Espresso is good but the packaging is questionable,I bought these because I have been making my own lattes for years now and prefer the cleanliness of pods vs ground espresso. I really enjoy Lavazza coffee and was looking forward to receiving this purchase. When the pods arrived at my home I was very disappointed to receive a large ziplock bag of loose (individually packaged) pods. There were a few pods that weren't even Lavazza. I looked at several of the individual pods to check for expiration dates (because they do go bad) and couldn't find any. So for all I know I could have been preparing old and expired espresso. What a bummer. I feel like I wasted my money and in the future I will not buy this particular brand from this site due to the seller's choice in packaging. But with that said - Lavazza is a great brand of coffee.
