2,Not accurate,It does not reflect the correct temperature. It is off by 5 or more degrees. Not happy with it and have to buy a different one that is accurate. Sorry.
4,Should I wear a sweater?,"The perfect solution for determining what clothing to wear without stepping out side in the morning. It's reasonably accurate, large, and can be positioned anywhere. I hung it with a string on my balcony."
5,Legible,"Great size, can read from 40 feet away (maybe farther depending on your need for placement).Seems to be accurate within + or - 3 degreesEasy to hang ( 2 screws or nails) about 8 in apart."
4,Nice big numbers,"We put this up on our shed in the back yard. It's easy to read, and seems to be accurate. The template made it very easy to put it up and it is attached securely."
2,Outdoor Thermometer,"I was looking for a large outdoor thermometer to place on a tree to view from my kitchen. The picture represents a ""white"" thermometer. The product I received is ""black"". Had I known it was black, I would have selected another item. Since its under $10, its not worth returning. This thermometer is extremely light weight...I hope I can secure it tightly enough to the tree so it doesn't blow away. I will also have to seal the cover to the frame so water doesn't seep in. You get what you pay for. It'll work until I find the proper item."
2,Taylor Thermometer,Product arrived on time. It has a very good look. It's temperature accuracy has a lot to be desired. It is usually 5 to 15 degrees off from the true outside temperature. Our official temperature is at the St. Louis airport and is only 15 minutes away. Our other thermometer on the other side of the house is always within 1 to 2 degrees of the temp at the airport. I conclude that this beautiful Taylor thermometer is not very accurate.
4,HUGE THERMOMETER,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT, BUT WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT'S GIGANTIC. I JUST DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE DIMENSIONS. IT WILL PROBABLY BE FINE, AND WE CAN HANG IT QUITE A WAYS FROM THE HOUSE. WE HAVEN'T PUT IT UP YET, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW IT FUNCTIONS. JUST BE PREPARED FOR A MASSIVE DIAL."
5,Dakota's Pride will enlighten your mind and capture your heart!,"Dakota's Pride is informative and entertaining for anyone who wants to gain a new understanding of Down syndrome. This documentary chronicles the journey a father took to learn more about his son's congenital disorder. I was touched by all the personal stories and impressed by the many ways children and adults with Down syndrome inspire people around them. This is a beautiful portrayal and I would recommend it to all my friends and family, and especially to any parent of a special needs child... it really shows the blessings that can come from raising a child with disabilities."
2,Yet ANOTHER Queen orchestral album?,"I fail to understand why this CD was released. After 4-5 similar albums (most done by the same people, the RPO) you'd think it's target audience would be satisfied.Not much can be said for this album, I've heard most of these songs re-done before and no new ground was broken here. I bought this CD solely because of the inclusion of Freddie Mercury's solo tracks, ""The Great Pretender"" & ""Barcelona"". It was nice to hear ""Barcelona"" with a proper orchestra instead of the cheesy synths Freddie used in the original to *try* to imitate a real one. A chorus of singers are used often in this album but they add nothing of value to the tracks....often sounding ""ho-hum"" to me.Unless you are a rabid Queen completist, don't waste your time or money on this release."
5,Way too much for shipping,"Is the shipping for this bag that weighs under 1 pound and only cost $3.99 for the small bag or $5.99 for the big bag really $6.00?!?!??! I was going to purchase it, until I realized that!!"
2,"Powerful, yet overdrawn","Starts off a wonderfully written poem, but draws its point out and eventually bores. Thomas is still a poetic and philosophical master, but this book is only for the diehards."
1,Only if I were in solitary confinement in prison and this was the book,"the only book available to read....I guess I would slog through this romantic sludge of idiocy. People who like this kind of garbarge aren't worth comment. Park this book in the outhouse for emergency use of toilet paper. Obviously, women who read this are trying to live through these female characters---and reveal themselves to be the schizoid nutcases that they really are. Get real, get a life, get a job!"
3,"Fun to see old friends, but overall quite flat...","While I had a wonderful time revisiting familiar characters (Charles Stuart and the rest of the Leslie family) and places (Brae and Glenkirk), I felt this book was very flat overall. The characters of Flanna and Patrick were unlikeable and very ""canned"". The story seemed forced, and while it was enjoyable to continue on with Skye's legacy and Jasmine's family, I felt this book was fairly lackluster.If you have already read the other books in this series, this one is worth it, simply to keep up with the goings-on. However, I wouldn't recommend this book to a first-time Betrice Small reader. It's much better to start out Skye O'Malley or Wild Jasmine.I am hopeful that Ms. Small's next installment will pack more punch !"
1,JUST BEYOND THE GARBAGE CAN,"The Do-Naught Duchess is right. Compared to Skye, Velvet, Jasmine, Janet, and Cat, Flanna is nothing. And unlike all the other books starring those heroines, JBT takes place entirely in Great Britan. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?! I was SHOCKED to find that Flanna (by the end of the book) has no idea what a harem is. For the love of God, this book really could've used a harem.And Patrick, well, I can't believe he was named for the first and second Earls of Glenkirk. What men they were! This guy is a joke of a man, and while he and Flanna get together in a way that smacks of ""A Love for All Time,"" at least Conn was an interesting man, witty and charming, with a scandalous reputation!Skye O'Malley, I beg you, please rise from your grave and beat the snot out of your descendents. Please."
2,Just Too Boring,"I am a big Bertrice Small fan, but the quality of her books is slipping, particularly noticeable with this latest book. I found myself skimming over large hunks of text that were either descriptions of historical events or the inevitable and prolonged descriptions of what the characters ate or what they were wearing. Another annoying habit the author has is to have her characters tell other characters about events that have been described earlier in the book. So you read about the event and then you have to suffer through repeat descriptions of the same event as a character relays it to others. This, of course is not really necessary, and seems too much like a device to fill pages, as opposed to telling a story or developing relationships."
2,I just couldn't get through it....,"For the first time....I was not able to get through one of Ms. Small's books...I love almost anything she does...but I guess I'm getting tire of the format...In all honesty, I was hoping she would begin to explore her ""American"" roots now that Fortune and her family were in the New World. Maybe that would make her books more intersting. I just keep getting the feeling that Ms. Small's publishers are providing her with the book and all she has to do is change the name of the characters. This format is not doing justice to the talent that Ms. Small has for the genre."
2,Simpering Fools a no go,"No reader wants a simpering mamma's boy as her hero. She wants a slightly overbearing man who is strong in his beliefs and strong in his physique. I do not want a hero to tell his heroine, ""that is not the way my mother did it."" For me, that killed the book right there. Also the heroine is a bit of a simpleton although that is her charachter being from the back woods but I think she could have caught on quicker."
2,Long Wait For Not Much,"Small should have looked a little farther than just beyond tomorrow. If she had, then this long awaited sequel to Skye's legacy would have been up to par. Small is probably my favorite author and Skye O'Malley is one of the best characters ever. This book really let me down. The characters were not well developed and the story just didn't have the typical Small ""oomph."" Anything by Small is worth the time it takes to read it, but wait until this one goes on sale or buy it used if you want to get your money's worth."
3,"Pretty Good, but not on par with her earlier books","Just Beyond tomorrow was a good bedside read, however it lacks the spark found in earlier books (Kadin/Love Wild & Fair/Skye OMalley, etc.). I found Flanna to be immature (although she is a country girl and not the regular world-wise heroine)- even up till the end, and Patrick to be somewhat of a wimp. Not at all like his father, James Leslie.If you are a Beatrice Small fan, you will definately enjoy the book, but wind up a bit disappointed too."
1,Beyond me,"This is the first Bertrice Small book I ever tried to read, and it will most certainly be the last. I am as much of a history fan as anyone, but the pages and pages of background detail which could have easily been handled with a few paragraphs of sound dialogue would have covered it. I could not warm to any of the many characters who were introduced, and thought I know it was part of a series and so I could not know all the characters, I did not really care enough about any of them to get involved. The 'love' scenes were appallingly bad and frankly quite crude. What a disappointment considering everyone told me I simply had to try this author. And the cover is as bad as the writing. The whole book was contrived and wooden."
1,very disapointing,"WOW This book was awful!!! Its started out good but then......just bad, boring, story. I have read all of Bertrice Smalls books. She is one of my favorite writers. But this book and Vixens were the worst. I would recomend reading this just because is goes with the series. But it was a big Disappointment."
5,ANOTHER HIT,Bertrice Small is by far the BEST historical romance author EVER!! It all started for me with Skye O'Mally and she has never dissapointed me. Her discriptions of the gowns and homes paint a picture in your mind and when she describes the food you can almost taste it. Another book I couldn't put down.
2,Don't bother,"I guess it depends on why you read this book, but if you want to know what to do in your home, don't waste your money on this one. She does a good job of telling the history of Feng Shui and lots of little anecdotes about the successful uses of it, but no good practical ways to use it for your own benefit. It didn't do a thing for me."
2,Buy the original albums,"One of my all-time favorite bands, I own there entire discography up to and including Power and The Glory. That said, don't buy this. Spend your money on the original recordings, not these polished re-recordings."
2,old,"souped up heavy metal interpretations of great old songs. don't let the cover fool you, these are not the old cockney rejects, these are old cockney rejects trying to sound young. who would've thought..."
3,Interesting Book however...,"I have to totally agree with N. Powell. I didn't like the typos, and the story was similar to Satin Doll, which I also enjoyed. So if you read the reviews like I do, then my review would have to agree with the writings of N. Powell. I did enjoy Sharif and think he should get his own book. It's a page turner, Read it!"
4,Good Story,"It's true form urban living in Harlem - true to the lifestyles of the characters and true to the nature of the characters. The plot is well developed.A good book for book club discussions. I think the book could have wrapped up better. Makes me think that Ms. Miller got a little weary or was rushed into a deadline to complete the book. Overall, a good book."
3,Product I received was not organic,"The product I received was not organic. I didn't think it was worth returning, however, the product description and photo need to be changed, or they sent me the wrong thing. Either way that is a problem that needs to be corrected by the seller."
5,REISSUE THIS!!!,I am mainly writing a review to see is someone will notice enough to reissue this book. Ya gotta love something that deconstructs counting ('So You Think You Know How To Count?').
3,"Works fine, but one issue.","This is a good lamp and does what it's suppose to do on my Presonus StudioLive 24.4.4 However the neck seems too stiff and firm, and as a result, it has loosened the BNC connector on my mixer. I can't open the mixer case up to re-tighten the connector without voiding my warranty."
2,Mechanics of Consciousness,Could not get past the first couple of chapters. This book would be great for many readers but just not for me.
5,Made a lasting impression,"I read this book many years ago, and it made a lasting impression on me as one of the most erudite, clear explanations of cosmology, consciousness, the place of high energy physics in the scheme of things I've ever read.Itzhak Bentov has a clear grasp of reality and makes a concise explanation of his view in terminology that is easily understood by anyone with a decent vocabulary.I highly recommend this book--particularly for spiritual seekers.Joseph H. Pierreauthor of The Road to Damascus and other books"
4,INSIGHT,"What is the glue that holds life together? Stalking the Wild Pendulum,take the readerinto the essence of raw energy,allowing the psychic a view of the soul. The invisible,becomes visible."
4,Ride the Wave...,"The pendulate wave, that is.Mind you, I am so analytically inept - not even funny. There were sections of Bentov's book that cramped my grey matter, big-time.However, on the whole, I found Bentov's book extremely enlightening. It provided some intellectual ""umph"" to some very slippery concepts...lending some brick & mortor to a realm that can get ""woo woo"" in a hurry.If you've got a grasp of consciousness from a soul perspective, I highly recommend adding Bentov's book to your knowledge base as it will provide a technical/intellectual aspect to your foundation. Bentov's points offer a nice backup of principles to use as a testing ground for your esoteric practices.Neat little analogies, diagrams and insights - this book is a true gold nugget among pyrite (""wanna be"") books."
2,Way to clever or way to obtuse,"Hello,I read this book - three times - and obviously didn't get it. Far from being a revelation it kept begging the question, how can works like this get published? and moreover, we wlecomed with such acclaim?Maybe it's because Itzhak Bentov is such a nice guy, maybe its because some people prefer mystical speculation and opinion to anything else, do I know why? haven't got a clue.Anyway, it's sitting there on my bookshelf ready to be read again, someday. Meanwhile, i'll just speculate on more mundane things.Regards,Martyn R Jones"
3,I drifted while reading it,"I won't tell the details of the story like most of the other reviewers have, but I will say that this book almost proved to be a worthy first attempt by a new author.Nikai and Robert were not likable characters at all which isn't a good thing. Nikai had a lot of personal issues that she needed to deal with but chose to spend her time seeking happiness in other people. The relationship between Nikai and Robert never cultivated even though the author allowed years to elaspe. I never understood what their beef was with one another. They spendt a lot of time declaring their love but never once was any love shown. The drama-driven family situations and friendships that surrounded them seemed to be heavily unrealistic at times. I was lost in a 400+ page tale that could have easily been written in half the pages along with a point."
2,Too Long,"I don't think this was a bad story, just way too long. I wish the author could have focused more on making Nikai a stronger person than that ridiculous relationship with Robert. By the end of the book, Nikai still hadn't accomplished anything more than what she had before she moved in with Robert. Nothing really made me feel good about the ending of the book."
1,I could not catch the drift!!,"Needless to say I did not like this book!. I thought it would have been better. I bought the book anticipating a ""good read"" and got completely the opposite. I would not purchase another book from this author. I hope the stories get better, but I will never find out!"
2,Oh Please!!!!!,"This book was a little bit over the top! Nikai and Robert move in together within a few weeks of knowing each other, and then proceed to claim that they love each other although they barely speak to each other. Like other reviewers have commented- this book is simply about 300 pages too long. It is need of some editing. I would read an R.M. Johnson book over this one."
2,Reader,"This book was just okay for me. I am now reading the other part to it, ""Anyone Who Has a Heart,"" and I am getting the same effect. The book drags on and on. It is to the point where I just want to get to the end of the book. Nikai is not very strong and it is not like she is naive. She has a job but it is taking her a year to save $500. She is living with her man and he is cheating (which she knows about it) but doesn't confront him about it or even accepts it for herself. It is like she is just moving around the situation. Rob is a mess in himself. I don't understand his whole part in this book. The ending of it seemed rushed with Karen's confession and it doesn't really tell what is going on with Rob. I don't think the author really dealt with any of the issues that she wanted to explore in this book."
3,O.K. BOOK BUT DID NOT CATCH THE DRIFT,"THIS BOOK WAS O.K., NOT A PAGE TURNER BUT OKTHE WOMAN IN THE BOOK IS GOING THREW ALOTBECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND WAS ARRESTED FOR SLEEPING WITH A MINORHER FRIEND TAKES HER OUT TO GET OVER IT ALLSHE MEETS A FIREMAN THEY FALL IN LOVESHE MOVE IN WITH HIM, THEY FALL OUT OF LOVEHER MAN FINDS OUT HE'S HAVING A BABY WITH THE WOMANWHO HE WAS SEEING WHILE HE WAS WITH HIS HERWHILE ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON SHE HAS SOME ISSUES TO DEAL WITHHER FAMILYAND HER SELF"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This book was so incredibly boring, I have no idea what it was about. I borrowed this book from my roommate. She loved it, I hated it.I can't write a long review b/c it's been several months since I read this book. But suffice it to say, you can skip this one. You'll thank me."
3,Okay read!,This book is full of drama but the aothor made things a little bit too obvious. She didn't give the characters a chance to show that they were more than just people looking for love in all the wrong places.
5,I luvd it!!!,"This book was very well written. Ms. Powell's first attempt was more than just an attempt. She crafted this story beautifully.I just love drama in fiction. I can't get enough of it, but my addiction was catered to with this novel.The very first page got me with her boyfriend Travis going to jail for statutory rape.....dayum!!!!!!This is not only a story of drama, but it has lessons in self-worth, self-acceptance, self-love and how to go for what you want no matter what others say around you or to you. Read the book, you'll learn something very valuable, I sure did."
4,GREAT DEBUT............,"and a good read! Meet Nikai....an aspiring singer with a boyfriend in jail who just cannot seem to pull her personal life together. In contrast, her sister Taylor seems to have it all; and Nikai just cannot seem to measure up.Then along comes Robert....and it would seem as if everything is finally coming together for our heroine. Unfortunately, however, at this point there are WAY too many pages left. So read on, and you'll discover that ROBERT is in fact too good to be true, LUCKY may not be a lost cause after all, and TAYLOR....well, let's just say that ""all is not as it seems.""Readers will root for Robert for a while...but WHO can resist Kalif? Certainly, as it turns out, not Nikai...This book is chock full of drama...but not of the typical genre. Ms. Powell has managed to add a new twist to all of the usual escapades.....enjoy the book!"
5,Fantastic Scanner,I work at the courthouse and their is a line for the copier. I am able to finish twice as much work as before with this pen. If you do not need to copy color pages then definately would get the black and white. It works great on low resolution. I am the envy of the courthouse.
2,Handheld Portable Scanner,"Seems like an awesome idea. Very small and portable. If you only have a page or two occasionally it would be OK, but much more than that use something else, though not sure what if you're traveling.Two main problems.1) It keeps cutting off, and2) getting the scan straight is very difficult.If you pause for any length of time the scanner shuts completely off, then you have to go through the process of restarting. This causes your scan to end saving what is done up to that point in a file. In essence you have to start over. This is very anonying.Because the scanner is so lightweight, it is very difficult to guide it straight, thus the image is distorted. For my use, massive amounts of continuous paper (well logs), just didn't work. Price is right though. Finally sent it back."
3,"Okay, but I wouldn't do it again.","Planon Systems Handheld Portable Scanner RC-800Great quality scans, when it doesn't shut off half-way across the page; difficult to keep straight, even with the little rollers, and hard to manage near tight bindings--probably easier on older, worn books, or ones with broken spines, but if you're not worried about breaking book spines, stick with a flatbed."
4,one of james bonds gadgets for the real world,"this tool is great , the first time i tried the rc800, i was at home waiting patiently for my order to arrive , which i must say was fast, opened the box and followed the quick start guide and i was up and scanning in about 5 min, very easy to use excellent scan quality , it has an almost film like scan at the highest resolution , i would recommend the docupen RC800 to anyone who wants to scan in color anywhere anytime, which really shows that the portable office is a now a reality"
1,Rip Off Beware,This is by far the worst product I have ever purchased. The positive reviews HAVE to be planted by the company. There is absolutely no way someone can have a positive experience with this crappy device.
1,RC-800 Not working properly and incomplete documentation,"I can not recommend this unit because my experience is that after receiving a new RC-800, it switches off before I even manage to start scanning or during a scan, after finished about 30-40% the battery icon turn red and switch off. And this is a brand new scanner!!!Have written to support today, so hopefully they will come back with a solution!But as it is today, I find both the manual, faq and problem solver for specific scanner very very incomplete.First I find the online support very confusing. If you want to find out how the batteries works with the RC-800, the online support is just saying something about coin batteries and recommend you to change them without specifying that this is only for the previous models and not RC-800. I went out buying a new set coin batteries not realizing, that this was only for DokuPen R700 and BW: :o(Also very little information to help you to solve a specific problem for a specific model!Per"
1,total waste of a lot of money,"I bought this docupen 800 from the planon website at $299 through a friend in US, since they would not accept non US address. The pen automatically turns off after scanning for a few seconds. I tried to charge the battery, assuming it is a battery problem, but since there is no indicator showing it is charging, I still do not know whether I have been able to charge the battery, and the scanner still can't scan for more than a few seconds, which covers only a few lines of a page. The manual is badly written, does not cover trouble shooting, and does not explain why some buttons are flashing after a few seconds of scanning and before it shuts off automatically. It also does not take user through step by step, such as start by checking if battery is working, how to charge it, and so on. A total disappointment."
1,Definately SKIP this ONE!,"I bought this crappy ""scanner"" so I could use it at the jobsite without having to haul my computer everywhere. To this day I can't charge it completely, I can only scan ONE page before it goes dead. So now I have to take my computer if I want to use it. That being the case I wound up BUYING a thin flatbed scanner (from canon) which is easier to use and works A LOT better and is WAY cheaper. If you buy this ""portable scanner"" you'll regret it!"
4,My Favorite Soul Singer,"Man, when Al Green sings, how do you not feel it?Even when the arrangements aren't the greatest, Al Green makes it work. The patience in his singing, on things like ""I Can't Get Next To You"" and ""Unchained Melody"" makes these slower-than-the-hit versions groove.And when the tunes are closer to the level of this great, great singer--on ""Tired of Being Alone,"" ""L-O-V-E (Love)"" and ""Sha-La-La (Make Me Happy),"" Green made downright gorgeous records.There are a couple question marks here. Why the long sloppy intro, and less-than-hi-fi recording, on ""Have A Good Time""? And why did nobody clean up ""I Want To Hold Your Hand""? These are two good songs, from what sound like two good sessions, presented in second rate fashion.The good stuff here far out weighs the bad."
3,Nothing Special,"I have liked Tavener since Apple and the Whale.I came across this in a budget section and gave it a whirl. Actually it has been in my car for three days. Well written, well sung, well orchestrated. Well what?Well it does not seem to me, although I am no expert, that it sounds pretty much like any other English choral music.It sounds good but does not sound special.I like it but it does not raise my soul."
3,Doesn't keep attention of my students,"I bought this book as a teacher, hoping to be able to use it for several ages (I teach K-5), but never found the right connection between the book and my students. I used it as an opening before an art project using toys, but the students were just not interested. I think this could be because they didn't recognize much from the pictures, but I can't say for sure. Was disappointed because I really like the photographs used."
5,excellent span of part's work,"my first thought was that i really don't need another version of part's classic tabula rasa. but at the naxos price, why not?the performance of the title piece is superb, well up there with ECM recordings of the 80's which first introduced me to part's music.the fun of discovery lies with the other two compositions- both are before part's signature tintinnabuli style, but still very enjoyable on their own terms. ""collage uber bach"" is alternately serene and angry. ""symphony #3"" (described in the liner notes as ""transitional"") is beautiful, but the liner notes mention another work of the same period that the composer had ""withdrawn"". argh.as usual naxos has done a great job on packaging, liner notes and all the little details. my only complaint would be the short CD length, a mere 52 minutes."
3,A correction,"I have to correct a mistake I did in my rewiew to this cd. While comparing it with the other recent Part cd ( Goteburg SO/Jarvi) I stated that the featured pieces are the same. It's not entirely true, because that cd does not contain the ""Bach Collage"" but instead has the other masterpiece of Part's mature style , ""Fratres"". Jarvi actually recorded the Collage, which is contained in his Part cd released by Chandos with the Philharmonia Orchestra."
4,great,"I bought this CD when it first came out and was immediately impressed. It brings out the sounds of many '60's British Invasion bands, including The Beatles, Dave Clark 5, The Kinks, etc. ""Nothing Left to Hide"" and ""Stupid Heart"" are two of my favorites, and could've been hits in the 1960's. However, the CD ""Beat and Torn"" is even better."
4,Probably their best..,"I haven't heard all their albums, but I think it's a fair guess this album is likely their best.Usually, I'm a bit wary of any artist that tries to copy the Fab Four to a tee. The Spongetones are an exception. At least, they are a tad more genuine than yer run of the mill, low-rent, power pop, Beatles clone.The vox are a little like Macca's and music is early day Beatles- but no so much that they are copy cats.The bottomline, Beatles references aside, the songwriting is fairly top notch and catchy. Most songs are under 3 minutes; only a couple are over 3 minutes (and one of those is an 'epic' 4 and a half minutes in length).Good stuff."
5,"Beautiful, wrenching..buy this CD!","This is some of Bogle's best heartwrenching stuff, especially ""It's Only Tuesday"" which is about Northern Ireland and the death and the hate and the people who are only trying to live their lives. I recommend this highly."
1,Some Good material but Not Bogel's Best Work,"Songs range from humorous (""Silly Slang Song"") to serious (""What Kind of Man"" - BEST Track on the disc).Some of the material seems to try to hard at being socially conscious. ""Amazon"", in particular, falls victim to the type of rash generalization that makes Greenpeace so annoying.All in all, not a good first introduction to Eric Bogel's fine body of work."
5,Don't Know What to Do? Start Here.,This book is great. It provides an organized approach to developing a great men's ministry. Even if you think your an expert you will learn somthing new.
5,Awesome Mopar information,Mopar Engines: Speed Secrets & Racing Modifications for Chrysler V-8 & 6 Cylinder EnginesDetailed information on getting the most performance out of most Dodge v6 and v8 engines (as of the original publishing date.A terrific reference book for Mopar enthusiasts.
3,Different concept,"There's competing school of thoughts of individual sets verse multiple sets. This book focuses on the idealogy of individual sets worked to max exhaustion. It's an interesting concept and one that can't be proved superior or inferior. It all depends on the work of the individual performing it. As for the diet routine, it's an important concept that even if you're trying to gain weight, to get your food from good, clean sources. Unfortunately when I tried the methods of this book 11 years ago, I didn't follow that philosophy and I ultimately gained ""bad"" weight. So my advice is to give it a try and to eat healthy on it."
1,Really NOT all that good.......,"I am a fitness trainer for the Traverse City Pwerhouse Gym in Michigan and I really don't think that this book is very helpful. It teaches a ""fast"" and ""Easy"" way to achieve muscle mass. Well to tell the people out there the truth about easy and fast muscle, well it just isn't true. To gain muscle mass and strength, it takes many months, and years to accomplish. Sorry to let you down but it is the plain a** truth. If you want to achieve muscle mass and stength, lift weights until you can't do them any more. That is my advice to you. or if you want to cheat, take steriods. They can do wonders for a skinny a** person that can't lift weights."
4,Slow is way to go,"I used the information in this book along with the diet for 12 days. I gained almost 4 pounds of muscle. If it was not for the diet I would have given this book five stars. Along with my muscle I also gained some fat. I don't recommend the diet in this book. Darden recommends that for every pound of body weight you have to times it by 20, and add 500 calories. This meant my diet started at 4500 calories. Then he recommends adding 300 calories per week for 6 weeks. Lets just say the diet sucks. You need to eat the hole day, and I felt sick trying to eat that much. When I stopped the diet portion of my program I lost about 2 pounds. I think it was water weight. The diet aside the lifting portion of this book is hard. You know when you walk out of the gym you got a good workout."
5,Invaluable help...simple but effective plan to gaining size,"Excellent book. Destroys many bodybuilding myths while providing proof Darden's work. Especially like his insistence that supplements are not needed to gain size. Great pictures. Only drawback to book was silly Contra One-Sided Training. Methinks Darden had space to fill and cooked this up. Speaking of that, receipes were excellent as well"
4,Excellent Bodybuilding & Diet Reference,"I bought this book about four years ago and still keep it handy for ready reference. Sure, there are some negatives to the book such as the contra-training routines (I think Darden found himself needing to fill space with this zinger). However, most else is truthful and helpful. I love the idea of gaining weight, strength and size without drugs and supplements. I basically went from 205 lbs to 228 lbs. in a couple of months. Being a family man with two sons, it was impossible for me to exactly follow prescribed diets, workouts and daily routines but I tried to fit all within my responsibilities and lifestyle. I think the pictures are great; very inspirational. It just strikes me as a more ""common sense"" approach to weight training and gaining."
5,I loved it,We gained 30 pounds in 42 days! We noticed hugediffrence in our biceps. We gained 3 inches to our 13 in biceps. We never gained inches in the waist either!
2,ok,"It is probably a great yoga class, but I just did not like the instructors. I could not watch the whole thing."
4,Lil' Square Dudes Rule,"If you like SpongeBob, then you'll like this game. A fun storyline about SpongeBob and his friends trying to get roles in a Mermaid and Barnacle Boy movie add more fun to this game. The game is a party game, best played with 1 or 3 other people. There are many different games you can play with your friends that are regular places in the SpongeBob universe, such as: boat driving at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, patty flipping in the Krusty Krab kitchen, and my favorite; racing with inflatible pants at Goo Lagoon Beach. All the games are fun and challenging. The only downside to buying this game is that playing by yourself is not very much fun."
4,good game,"It's way better than those stupid Mario Party games.I like when you get to play as Squidward,Plankton, and Mr.Krabs."
1,retarted game,"this game is almost as bad as the show. all the games on it are so stupid that i laughed and it made me wet my pants.pros: more than 1 gamecons: stupid, cheeseman, and well... stupidjust to know my name is (...)."
3,baby pleasant,The cassette was given to me by my mother-in-law because I am not hispanic; we want to share that heritage with our daughter. Our daugher really likes the mellow tunes and they always ease her to sleep.
3,Latin Lullaby,"I haven't got a chance to listen to it yet, but I was very pleased to find out that the CD included the words to the songs."
3,Zombie Farce,This is a wannabe zombie flick. It has more to do with voodoo than anything else. There's 1 zombie throughout the film & the others don't show up until 3/4 of the movie has gone by. The 1st zombie was a wife batterer. Not cool! They were all created by a form of Santeria. This just didn't strike a chord w/me. I give it an F for Farce! Very tedious story line. George Romero has nothing to worry about. This doesn't even come close.
1,My 2 1/2 year old and I are very disappointed,"He finds the George ""video"" boring - this is not a child who watches videos or TV regularly, so this is surprising, since he LOVES Curious George. THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATION OF CURIOUS GEORGE. And the ""other"" tales of mischief are stories of other characters, some of which are scary to my 2 1/2 year old. He is still having nightmares from one of them.This product should make it more clear that it is a compilation of a VARIETY of character-based stories. The marketing/advertising implies that this video is a compilation of Curious George videos --had I known it was not, and that the Curious George story was not even a video, I would NOT have purchased it."
4,"The Term Is ""Iconographic""","The stories that are photographed, not fully videoed are a style called ""iconographic"". It allows the child to enjoy the story and the illustrations.Of course it would be far, far, better if the parent would actually sit down with the child and READ the book. But for those who use videos, at least this is exposing the child to some quality literature--and the story quality is far far better than most of the fully animated junk out there!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!!!,"Although the description says ""animated"", don't believe it!!! The only animation for the George clip is someone moving pictures of the character around!!! My granddaughter (4), kept asking when they were going to do something! The other parts--yes curious george has only one episode even though the title says other wise--were very disturbing to my granddaughter. All in all, money I shouldn't have spent!!! sandy ;^)"
2,No legend on each chart,"My feelings are the same as the other writers, but I will add one thing that bugs me the most. There is no distance scale on the charts. In order to see the distance measurement you must turn to the early pages of the book and find it on the one page that has it. I like having the distance scale on each chart. (Granted all charts except insets are the same scale, but when I am making a quick assessment of distance I want to see a scale not work from memory).I now buy the cruising chart collections from a different company which come in two parts, one for Maryland, one for Virginia. Not waterproof but come with a plastic cover. (In 30+ yrs of sailing I find waterproof charts unnecessary anyway.)"
3,Not as good as former editions....,I bought the newest edition to be current with nav info etc. The format is the same but the quality of the binding is just OK. The charts are folded in half and binding is very important to allow it to lay flat. This new type binding does not seem as good and only time will tell the tale.
3,"Not bad, but there are far better compilations out there","This album includes three CDs, but frankly I'd rather buy 1 or 2CD compilations such as PVD - Politics of Dancing or Tiesto - Magik 5,6 or Nyana for the same price and get a far more exciting album.This album has a few really amazing tracks such as Plastic Boy - Silverbath, but for the most part it's pretty boring."
3,"A for effort, but fails a critical test","The authors of ""Fortress America"" had the resources and effort to put together a very good book on the subject of gated communities. Unfortunately they also had such a strong desire to prove their point that they fail to include the most relevant information... crime statistics.One wonders what else wasn't mentioned."
1,Disappointing,"This is an important topic, but the empirical work in this book is at the level of the average newspaper. The work doesn't even take into account that all counties in California didn't follow the rules. What about simultaneously trying to account for arrest rate and conviction rates or changes in any other factors that affect crime?"
3,IM AN 8TH GRADER,"AND WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING THIS BOOK IT REMINDED ME OF LANGSTON HUGHES POEM ""THE WEARY BLUES"" BECAUSE IN THE WEARY BLUES HE TALKES ABOUT HARLEM(DOWN ON LENOX AVENUR THE OTHER NIGHT) AND WHAT HE HEARD AND FELT WHEN HE WALKED THE STREATS OF HARLEM(125TH STREET)"
4,undeniably powerful storytelling,"I don't know what JV has been doing for the last 20 years, but I hope this novel marks a new invigoration in his writing. Back to the basics works for many artists. There is real storytelling power here, like in ""Millennium"" (not the movie!). Sure, it's sometimes dumb, and sometimes silly, and sometimes maudlin, and shamelessly steals from ""Armaggeddon"" and other movies. But it works, and you will remember scenes and ideas from it probably for a long time. What if - someone did invent new history-changing technology in their pole-barn? Why isn't that possible?"
2,"If John Varley hadn't written this, it would deserve 4 stars","Virginia sez:I was thrilled when I learned that John Varley had written a new book--I bought it immediately, and started reading it the day it arrived. It was a fun book, and I enjoyed reading it, but it just came nowhere near what I've come to expect from Varley. The characters were two-dimensional, especially by the standards of the rest of Varley's work, and the deus ex machina of the drive technology of the ship irritated me. If this is the first of Varley's books you've read, you're in for a real treat when you pick up Wizard or Steel Beach and see what he's really capable of."
1,just terrible,"I love Varley. His Titan trilogy stands as one of the finest works in all SF. That's why this is --so-- disappointing. As others have pointed out, this is vaguely reminiscent of Heinlein's juvenile SF, but it is not nearly as good. This isn't appropriate for juveniles and I don't even think they would find it interesting. The first half of the book is about the variously messed up lives of some uninteresting teenagers. The character development is poor, the dialog is wooden. The ""washed up ex-astronaut"" and the events that led to his disgrace are implausible and the ""character"" is very poorly developed. The novel is supposed to be filled with coon-ass cajuns from south Lousiana. Well, I grew up in New Orleans, and these characters are completely hollow, with no authenticity.I can't recommend this book at all. Read Titan/Wizard/Demon or the short fiction by this author, but this book is one to avoid."
5,It never falls flat.,"Varley has done good work here. Simply said, he had a story to tell and did it in fine style.This story is a reminder of the early days of science fiction space opera. There is a solid cast of colorful characters, each with their own personalities, and not one of them a cardboard cut-out.If you like space opera, read this book. If you like well-told tales, read this book. If you want to spend some enjoyable time while you are on vacation, or are taking a long drive or a flight, if you just want something to read, if you want something that is uplifting, then just go ahead and read this book."
4,"A good read, too much sex","I'm afraid I must agree with some of the other reviewers. Characters somewhat cardboard, but there are some real moments. I'm afraid the people are way out of the ordinary in their actions and interests, though: I've known many tremendously talented, capable people. Most were quite ordinary.I really do think there was too much sex.It was fun to read, though, for relaxation."
2,"idiot savant invents neato space drive, wackiness ensues","Apparently this author occasionally writes good books... this wasn't one of them.Am I the only one that truly hates the completely contrived ""hey look at this advanced tech that just happened to fall into our laps"" nonsense? It did pick up a bit towards the middle and then truly killed itself with one of the all-time moronic endings. Gah!"
4,Great Fun,"I am not a big Sci-Fi reader, but when my 11 year old nephew gave this one a very positive review (he's recently become a voracious consumer of Sci-Fi) I thought I'd read a few pages, if only to see what he saw in it. And I ended up reading it straight thorugh over the course of two days.This is a marvelously fun book, with interesting characters (including a backwoods Cajun who might just be the most brilliant physicist in history), a novel twist on a classic Sci-Fi plot (amateurs in space) and some outragous science that presented so cleverly you really want to believe it. There's just enough suspense to keep you interested right up to the end and enough gentle comedy to keep you smiling. Buy a copy and toss it in your beach bag to read this summer."
3,Sci-Fantasy at its best!,"This is one of those Sci-Fiction/Fantasy stories you know isn't ""real"" but its just such a feel-good book you can't put it down! You know, the hero is a loser, no future, bla in the looks department, etc etc etc. When ALL OF A SUDDEN! The fates smile down on him and boy do they really SMILE!First our hero and his friends almost run over a infamous astronaut, his hillbilly best bud, invents a sublight stardrive which just happens to have 30 bazillion other uses from weapons to garbage disposal! He's gotten a rich girl friend, he and his friends are building a spaceship and they are on their way to Mars... oh ya... and they need to get there like now to beat the Chinese so as to be the first humans to land...All in all not a bad read at all. You could find tons worse ways to burn a cold rainy day!"
5,Outstanding!!,"The movie was made even better by the subtle, yet complex tone set by this music. Defintely music to reflect to. If you do not have the film at hand, all the mood and emotion is captured by this soundtrack. If you do have the movie, make sure the audio is high quality stero! A must for the music eclectic!"
5,Hoerseflies holiday,This is a great soundtrack from a great indie film by a great non-traditional band.Been looking for a copy of this forever - saw the band in concert at Paul Smith'scollege years ago and all the copies of this offered lately were exhorbitantly priced. Score!
1,Really...,If i was a fish living in this thing i would comit suicide. I found a ten gallon for only ten dollars at goodwill. Also i found a 29.00$ 10 gal it came with a filter fish food and a ph. Testing kit at walmart. Dont buy this unless you are going to clean youre tank or if youre fish is sick.!
2,for phantom and critcha of other show,"lacks visual creature action and phantom to fake, the former-better film and invisible action, i remember the jabean-the germ. shep. dog."
1,what a crock,"This has the right *shape* to be a sgian dubh, but why in the heck is the handle decorated with aztec or mayan pictures? and why in the heck is there a tiki god on the pommel? I really ought to get my money back but I imagine that it's be more trouble than it's worth. I mean, if they're going to pass this Aztec knife off as Scottish, what makes me think they'll listen to my complaint. DO NOT BUY THIS KNIFE."
4,Turquoise and carnelian stones bracelt,This bracelet is very pretty and an accurate description was given for the stones. I would recommend buying this bracelet for quality and color.
5,SUBLIME,"Sublime, one of the greatest punk bands of the 80 and 90's has definetly made a great selection of songs here. Bradley Nowell, the lead singer of Sublime, has a great taste in style. And he combines, punk/ska/reggae and a bit of everything else into his music which makes it unique. You definetly have to check this out!"
3,Disappointing,"This book is not for the experienced crafter. If I had had the opportunity to flip though it before purchasing, I wouldn't have purchased it. With that said, I do think it could be useful for someone young and new to crafting. It has some good basic information and cute projects. I sent it to my 23 year old daughter and she is enjoying it much more than I."
4,This is fun and provokes exploration,"This book does wake you up to possibilities. Her basic point of view is very personal and might not grab everyone, but the use of color and adventurous spirit of the book is enough to get anyone off dead center..embroiderer's version of writer's block."
5,Higher Ground,"Janie has always had a great love for music. I've know Janie since the 80's and rarely did you see her without her quitar. Her ability to write, sing and play what she feels in her heart is quite an exceptional talent. I love the way she incorporates nature in the words and sounds of her music. To listen to her music gives one a calm and peaceful feeling."
3,Gratitude: A way of Life,"This book holds some great truths about gratitude. After reading it, I am more convinced that gratitude is a choice and we must become more aware of our need to have a grateful heart in all areas of our life."
5,Gratitude A Way Of Life,This is just an amazing book which taps into the power of gratitude. I loved every minute of it and couldn't put it down. Definitely a must for everyone!!!!
5,"Decent paper, gummed tape probably works better on it than clear tape","What a nerd I am-- reviewing a huge roll of paper. But it really was great for shipping or craft uses and a very good price. I liked it enough to buy a second roll before I ran out of this one.Previously I was using a paper from a dollar store (in small rolls) that was smoother to the touch and folded better. Consequently, I have noticed clear plastic tape does not adhere as well to this larger roll of paper. However, gummed tape (applied with hot water) will work better than the plastic tape.Best thing is this makes for a package that is fully recyclable. This is a far better alternative to plastic bags or heavy cardboard boxes.Warning that the paper roll is very heavy-- recommend using a dispenser as it is a lot to handle without. Or maybe I am just a wimp."
5,Wonderful overview of a wonderful life,"This is a fabulous overview of the life of one of America's great composers, responsible for ""Guys and Dolls"", ""Hans Christian Andersen"", ""The Most Happy Fella"", ""Where's Charley?"" and the Pulitzer-Prize-winning ""How To Succeed in Bussiness Without Really Trying"", not to mention several readily recognizable songs including ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". This video traces Loesser's fascinating life from childhood to his sadly premature death. You will learn so many things about Frank Loesser that you probably didn't know all packed into this retrospective."
1,Maybe one and a half stars.,"Some of the trax are pretty cool. Dark Star by Grisman grooves. The tunes by the Cumberland Blues andthe Cache Valley Drifters are really fine. Dylan's ""Devil"" is kinda nice, but it sounds like a boot. Lots of the trax are funny, like a comedy CD. Like Golden Road by the Bobs, and Ripple by Sex Mob. Uncle John's Band by the Stanford Marching Band is cool but one listen and out!!! That's about it for this CD, too. One listen and out!!! And the cover looks like a boot, too."
1,PersuaDEAD!!,Black Muddy River by THE PERSUASIONS is the winner here. Makes you want to hear everything else they have ever recorded!(which I understand is about 20 or so albums..mmmmm) I'd love to hear an entire CD of these guys singing GD. Hopefully someone is already workin' on it....
1,Wilted Roses,"These songs just do not compare to the originals nor do they have much if anything to add to the originals. There is no rhyme or reason to the song order and the collection is so all over the map I cannnot think of any time or place in which one would want to hear the whole thing, or even half of it. One or two good moments (a fresh Cumberland, a virtuous Dark Star) do not make up for some of the really annoying stuff (a self-indulgent Franklins, an overdosed Pasta on The Mt., Cream Puff War, High Time) or the boring (a faux old-timey Ripple, a wannabe Unbroken Chain). The two greats on here, Dylan and Patti, deliver surprisingly sub-par and sonically disappointing performances as well. A bizarre set. The cover is the best thing about this production. Commended to fanatics only. The Grateful Dead Tribute Album cottage industry needs to wrap it up. All been downhill since Deadicated. Time to move on!"
4,"Great machine, but...","I have one of these and I love it. I would recommend purchasing a couple extra cutting boards because they get worn down and you either need to put some thick paper under the board, or use a new one. This machine is HEAVY.I've only used Sizzix and Sizzlets Dies with it, but have read that it is compatable with other dies as well. However - I just bought new Thick Cuts Dies which I THOUGHT would be compatable and they are too big for this machine. If you want to be able to use ALL dies on the market, you should buy the Ellison BigShot or the Sizzix BigKick."
5,Love my Sizzix!,I've had my Sizzix for years...use it constantly for scrapbooking and school projects with the kids. I love it!
3,Only 2 sleds!!!,"There were a lot more sleds in 88 and 89 than 2. I was disappointed not to see my '88 Eltigre' 6000 in the pages. This is an all out shop manual for the '88 and '89 Wildcat 650 and the '89 Eltigre' EXT. It covers everything really well. I see that amazon has added the Clymer to the title now which helps identify what it is. When I ordered it there was no info on the book, so I hope this helps some."
4,Arctic Cat Snowmobile 1988-89 (Clymer Snowmobile Repair Series) via Amazon,"I had read the reviews about this repair manual and wasn't certain of what to expect but I have had good service via Amazon in the past so I went with them again. The manual arrived in the time promised in a secure package and in good condition as was indicated on the website. I am well satisfied with the manual and the service from Amazon.Actually I had already submitted a review on this earlier, but perhaps it got lost in the shuffle. (So I will settle for 50 cents off on the next purchase for this 2nd review... that's a joke! ... we need a little humor in this review business.... I work rather cheaply, don't I!)"
3,Could have been better,"I agree with the previous reviewers that this is not one of the better warship titles in the New Vanguard series. I also agree that the old battleships should have been called what they really were, ""pre-dreadnoughts"". Regarding those, it bugs me that the side views of the ships pre-refit and post-refit are drawn to different scales!I also wish that the author had also given some description of the unbuilt H-class battleships; the parallel title on British battleships does describe an unbuilt class.And a minor point about many of Osprey's titles: I wish that measurements, such as for gun size, were given in English as well as metric units. I know that these books are published in the U.K., but there are many buyers of these books who are more comfortable with inches and feet, and it would be a trivial matter for the author and publisher to include both sets of units."
2,Amy Brown seatcovers...,"They look really nice, but they don't hold up. I washed them once, and they fell apart. I had to replace them, chalking it up to my own ineptitude. None of them fit my seat properly, and kept getting all kinds of wrinkles in them. The blue fairy part of it completely faded to purple."
1,beautiful but fragile,The seat covers are beautiful but ripped right down the seam when used for the first time.
1,cheap,"My seat cover was way too loose on the seat, after saying that it fit my seat type. Then, it ripped at the seem in less than one week. I don't recommend this product. All it has going for it is looks, definitely not quality"
3,check it out,i got the seat cover for my wife for her ford fusion that i bought her. In about 1 week from putting the seat covers on they ripped.
2,They are beautiful but poor quality,"I bought these less than a month ago for my Plymouth Voyager, first of all one size fits all doesn't seem to apply to these, they are too big for my seat and are always slipping off. Secondly the seam is ripping on both of them already. They are pretty don't get me wrong but for what we pay for these things they should last more than a month."
1,Rips so easily!!,Well i bought two of these... i put it in my car in less then a week both of them ripped in the middle area... i expected it to last a little longer??-_- i guess ill try sewing it back together or something
2,re: to poor quality,I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality.
2,Moonsprite Seat Cover,"Don't waste your money. If you have to have the set like I did, go for it, but buy heavy coarse thread and reinforce the seam where you'll be sitting. The seam splits in maybe a week to a month. Very cheaply made. I liked the fact that dog hair is easy to remove from the velvety surface, but its already ripping. Don't waste your money."
4,great product,"These seat covers were bought for my daughters car, a Nissan Sentra. They are very good quality and very easy to put on. You do need to have a car with a head rest for them to fit."
2,not to good,"Well, I had them on my seats for two days; when a hole was somehow formed into the whole entire seat of the driver.... they are very pretty though."
4,seatcover purchase,"A comfortable car seat is important, but keeping a car seat safe and dry is even more important. Finding the right color to match the other covers in your seated-vehicle is a neverending struggle for some people. This product lists one for the color black. I don't know... black can produce a lot of heat. Maybe it would be better to purchase one in the winter when the sun isn't so hot."
1,Amy Brown Faery Bucket Seatcovers,"Love the motif, just don't like how the velvet rips at the seams, I have replaced the covers 3 times, all three times the velvet rips out of the seams. Its a shame they made such a shoddy product. MAA"
1,MAJOR Disapointment,My husband and I thought this book would be a fun take-along for our fall RV trips - something humerous to read while we had time alone together. The book was full of disconnected and fragmented thoughts. The information was not creative - nor was it humorous. The book was a waste of time and money.
1,Canceled order twice,Ordered velvia twice-cancelled both times. Do not order anything from this schlock! Worstvendor I have dealt with. Can't understand why Amazon tolerates this!
3,Buyer Beware: No booklet,"The music is timeless, of course, and this set delivers the goods. As historic as these performances are, you'd think there would be an information booklet included with the set, as there was with the 1992 set and, indeed, just about every CD set on the market. Nope! Keep that in mind when deciding which set to order, this more recent slipcase version or the older box. As far as I can tell from the reviews, the mastering and sonic quality are the same. Incidentally, used copies of the 1992 booklet are available on the Amazon site for extra $$."
4,One and a Half Thumbs Up,"Overall I was satisfied with this CD purchase from Classical Music Superstore. The price was excellent, and I also received courteous and efficient customer service (from Christy Hill of Naxos of America) to replace a flawed disc (quickly receiving a replacement set). My only quibbles were that the initial shipment time was a bit slow, as was the response to my first e-mail about the defective disc."
2,Not much melody.,"It seems unthinkable that the ancient Egyptians had NO concept of using pleasurable patterns of sound to create melody. This CD, however, seems to argue that notion. Few patterns emerge... it seems more often that one completely random note is followed by another and another.Definately a very different CD, notable perhaps for its novelty, but not much more."
2,the sound of ancient egypt,as you can see i didn't like this cd. i am very interested in ancient egypt. i didn't like this cd because it was filled with mostly flutes and soft drums. there is hardly any singing and the singing sounds more like music from my church. and of the 18 tracks 13 of them are instrumental. i found this cd to be a waist of my money and i believe it will be for you as well.
4,Wonderful Music By Both (Alone and Together),"Aptly titled, this album features music by masters of the flat top guitar and banjo, respectively, who sound wonderful, both alone and together."
3,customer service problems,"The chairs required hours to put together. 3 of the plastic footplates were broken, and one of the eight chairs did not fit together well. MULTIPLE emails to customer service has produced no help.Seven of the eight purchased are very nice, and if nothing is wrong with your order, Amazon is fine. But if the Chinese workmanship fails, the order seems to fail also."
1,Er-D360 battery,The battery arrived here completely dead and would not take a charge. There was no replacement available. I did receive a refund without any hassle.
3,intresting,It was very interisting but you had to pay full attention to what was going on. I like that in a book. You kept wanting to find out more and more but the plot wasn't all that great. If your the silent type i think that you should read it.
3,Musica agradable para bailar,Si amenizas fiestas aqui hay buen material bailable (Cumbia) que a todos gusta. Recomendable tenerlo en la coleccion par entretener.
1,"15"" Mac Book Pro","I was expecting at least a degree worth of difference, it did NOT help at all!Absolute waste of 50 dollars!"
4,laptop cooler,Works very well with my Dell latitude laptop..solve the heat issue I was having with my video board.
4,Great cooler,"I bought this to use with a 15.4 inch HP widescreen notebook. It is a very good cooler overall, I like the additional rubber pads it has to life the notebook off even higher from the base, and it is not too loud even at the highest setting (unless you're particularly picky about that). It keeps my notebook running VERY cool even after hours of use, the fans don't ever turn on. I also like the fact that the fans are also encased on the bottom of the base, not just the top, which makes for easyMy only problem with this product is that the whole top base is not made of aluminum, and a strange clicking noise once in a while."
3,Maybe it is just the computer,"Bought this for an overheating Dell Inspiron 5100 because it tends to spontaneous shut-off when it gets too hot. Well, my computer still gets past 75 degrees with this cooler--honestly, I wanted to see a difference but I can't say that I have. I have a program monitoring the temperature of my computer so I can actually see that the notebook cooler isn't doing much. But the computer has a problem--so perhaps nothing will help it. The product seems like a decent one and may work for a less ""sick"" computer."
4,Good info for times like this,"I had been to a seminar by the author many, many years ago and previously had this book. Over time and a few cross country moves it had been misplaced. With the economy in the tank, I was glad to find another copy in good condition! Thank you."
5,Just wonderful,"This is one of the most wonderful, joyous albums of acoustic guitar music you will ever hear. Bonfa was just bursting with inventiveness and rhythm... a LOT of fun, and it stands up to many, many repeat listens."
2,Not very helpful,"This book is a review of the 60 colleges in the ""Most competitive"" catagory of the big Barrons Review of American Colleges. Each review is written by a recent graduate of the college. Each review therefore a very subjective opinion, not an objective comparision. Every single review is exactly the same, and this is what every one says: ""This school is wonderful, the professors are the best, most caring but challenging prof's in the world, the campus is fantastic, the dorms are great, the nearby town is perfect and the students are the best people in America"".Honest. Every single one. Now you don't have to buy the book!"
3,Utah Phillips CD,"A lot of spoken word on this CD, which is all right if that is what one is looking for. Also much is commentary on politics and war which is dated (although I agree with his opinions)."
2,Useless course in Russian,"This set has 3 CD's, a Russian coursebook, and a Russian dictionary. The coursebook does have information in it but the book is not put together in a way that aides learning.The first lesson is 5 pages long. Part A is titled The Letters and Sounds of the Russian Language but tells you that the letters and sounds will be learned in another chapter. Part B gives a list of people's names and Part C lists geographical names.Lesson 2 is just another list of words and names.Lesson 3 gives a list of the Cyrillic alphabet and the names of the letters but not the sounds!The dictionary might be ok but since I don't know Russian, how would I know. The front of this book gives a 4 page pronunciation chart.I do think the coursebook would be ok for a phrase book.I don't think the CD's are very useful except the parts that conjugate verbs.Overall, this is not worth paying full price."
4,Good Tutorial,This DVD was very insightful in alot of ways. The concepts taught were presented in a manner that is easily understood. My only wish is that I had actual JKD instructors in my area.
3,Important book that needs more focus,"Silence on the Mountain by Daniel Wilkinson is an important work on the recent history of Guatemala that needs to be heard and remembered. Unfortunately, this jumpy narrative is unnecessarily hard to follow and the length is unnecessarily too long by about 100 pages.When the author first interviews the townsfolk and plantation workers, he is met with a determined silence which intrigued me. The secrets they guard are horrific, and equally disturbing is the culture that creates the incentive for them to remain silent. The locals frequently answered questions using vernacular such as ""Sí pues"" and ""Saber"" which is the language equivalent of passively shrugging one's shoulders. Over time, Wilkinson does start to earn their trust."
5,to Brady L. Buchanan,I have to wonder how America's role in Guatemala's civil war and in the oppressive history of most Latin American countries has managed to escape your attention.
3,difficult to follow,"The book was not organizeed chronologically based upon events as they occured, but rather organized according to the author's travels. This makes the book difficult to follow with glimpses of various time periods revealed here and there. I finished the book feeling as though I hadn't really gotten the full story."
3,A WHOLE POPULATION LIVING IN FEAR,"This is a textbook of the history of Guatemala during the 60's through the 80's of a specific geographical area that probably applied to the whole country. Fear is the overriding force that each citizen of Guatemala lived with during these times. Over 200,000 people (not the military) were killed ... the supporters of the army and/or guerilla side.You learn of what happens when a dictator is the ruler of a country and/or the military has all the political control of a country. It is horrible and upsetting.This book will help you appreciate the U.S.A. with all of it's flaws. Thank God I was born in the United States of America."
3,Guinness Book of Records 2006,I was very disappointed in this order. I ordered the first one and it came in spanish. There was no choice to respond to with this error. I cancelled the order (having to pay postage) and reordered it for my grandson (there was no mention on this order of it being in spanish). When he rec'd it it was again in spanish. There is no one to speak to regarding this to get it straightened out. It still is not corrected.~~Carol Brown
5,A Rare Transcription Set...,Amazon's listing doesn't make clear that this recording is of a rare transcription for two pianos. Exquisite!
5,You will never guess the ending.,"It's a book within a book. Both real life and the author's plots twist and twist and in the next to last chapter, you think you've got it figured out. Then you find that you weren't even close and yet, all the clues are scattered throughout the book in ITALICS."
5,"Zildjian 12"" K Custom dark splash cymbal","This is a great splash cymbal that has the warmer sound I was looking for. Not a harsh, sharp attack but a warm, more mellow splash sound best suited to classic rock play. Great for my set-up.Thanks,Bob C."
1,Expeditions are very weak,Definitely not water resistant. Failed from use in a swimming pool. I've had several other timex expedition products and they were not much better. Expedition watches are not very rugged. I've had it with Timex all the way around.
2,its horrible,"I just bought this watch a couple months ago and it broke. It says its good up to 100 meters but that's a lie. I went swimming in a swimming pool and it leaked, its still working but i can't read the screen at all. I bought this watch because it was almost like my old watch that worked just fine for 7 years. I took that one scuba diving tons, it went with me to about 115 feet and it never got any water in it. But this one is horrible it died in less than 5 feet of water."
5,Great,This is a great watch. The buttons are well placed & the manual is well written. The light button is easy to find.The band is first rate.
3,Not the best Expedition,"I have had three Expedition watches previously and was quite pleased with all of them (except perhaps the short lives of the leather or rubberesque bands). Not so with this one. I do like the small and light format and the ease for adjusting time and other functions.The main complaint is the low-contrast face, which makes it comparatively harder to read than the other Expeditions I have had. That, and I should have been smart enough to guess what an exposed-Velcro watch band would do. It is a crud-magnet. A wee piece of rubbish floating by 10 metres away will suddenly change course and attach itself to this Velcro. Sheep dag, small insects, pieces of plants, old hymnals, volcanic ash, asteroid residue .... you name it, it will become as attached to this watch as a hooker to a southern Democrat."
4,Good work watch!,"This Timex is a good work watch that can really take a beating, It's comfortable, quick on and off and survives moderate physical abuse. the only negatives are the band, after about a year, the velcro gets pretty weak, still usable but if you bump your wrist on something, it's coming off. The other thing is that the material of the band can get ""funky"" from sweating with it on, not a deal breaker but you will definetly need to hand wash the band every couple of weeks in the Summer. All in all, it's a good watch! I had one that lasted about 6 years and when the battery finally went out, I just bought a new one because the band was wore out and the face was pretty scratched up."
1,Display too dark,"As soon as I opened the box, I saw that the display was too dark...not the same as shown here."
4,promess without tomorrow,"only 35' of planty music.It sounds sometimes like roland kirk ,full of life and joy.Damage it's the only recording of this group."
2,"So, so, not much to write home about","Spies Like Us was good but the other three were eh. If they really wanted to make a good set, they should have included the original National Lampoon Vacation along with The Jerk instead of the other Steve Martin movie and then Groundhog day instead of that other Bill Murray movie. But what do I know, this is why they sell these four packs in the first place.Bottomline: you get what you pay for."
4,A great deal,"This was the best deal I found for four movies I like. The package of movies is a little random as far as actors and all, but it's a great deal."
2,Not Made to Last,"I am very disappointed in this dryer. I have only had this dryer for 2 years and used it only on occasion and all of the sudden in the middle of drying my hair it just shuts off! I had a Westinghouse bonnet dryer for over 18 years that still worked when I bought this one, but it was so old the pins were coming out that attached the bonnet to the body of the dryer, but it still got hot. I only bought this because of the anti static ion properties that I thought would be better for my hair. I've very disappointed with the quality of this dryer. Shame on you Hot Tools!"
4,Hell Girl Forever.....,"Okay I just Got done these DVDS a few hours ago and I must say though they were good, they weren't quite on par with the other ones. Their storylines weren't as dramatic or as dark or morbid as the others it was much more normal. It has a few new characters in this like a new straw named Yamawaro, a girl named Yuzuki who is the main character with Ai. And Akie her friend. Also Tsugumi makes an appearance from the first Season of Hell Girl though she is a woman now, also you learn about what happened to Hajime and will get Yuzuki and Yamawaro's past.Kikuri is also still with the group. Anyway the story was to me a bit more confusing at times. However dispite its faults I would still recommend it as the series as a whole is just great and this one was great as well."
1,Did I say rich?,"Janie's voice is rich. Yes, that's it...rich.Rich in textures and rich in tone.Her CD Closer to Home brings joy to my earsand joy to my soul.And because the subject matter of her originalsongs are comprised of awakenings I often findmyself experinecing awakenings when I listen.Richthank you janie worm"
1,These 'Shoes' should walk to the discount bin!,"I don't know how these guys' later releases are,but I bought this on rave-up reviews about the band from the net. If you like listening to throw-away cuts of early 60's era Who songs-then you might enjoy this. Otherwise-avoid like the plague!! Buy at you're own peril.(if you enjoy 'pop'-get SUGARBOMB-'Bully')"
2,Poorly constructed,"The charcoal filter thing did not fit into the tube that was meant to hold it, making it totally useless. Also, it got knocked onto the laminate floor from the top of a small dresser and shattered, which is not what I would expect from a plastic fish bowl.I won't be buying a replacement."
5,unique,"I can't review this album, I only can review Braxton's voice and there is only one word to describe it, unique. The album is a way for one of the most amazing careers in the american industry. 5 stars."
3,Still ALOT Better than the standard models,"We use this come along for treework. In the past, our company has bought the standard hand winches available at the usual stores. They often break in the middle of jobs and parts bend easily. Nothing is worse than holding back a tree with two identical come alongs brand new out of the box, and having them both break at the same time!This model has lasted longer and held stronger than all of the others combined. Yes, I have to buy a new winch every year or so, but it is the same price as the cheaper 2 ton pulls and lasts 3 times as long! I think that is still a pretty fair assesment that the product is worth it!"
4,Needs 2 Posts,"It arrived very fast and is of good quality. It has nice raised letters. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is that I didn't expect was to have the bolt post holes in each of the 4 corners instead of two holes in the center. Unless you want to drill your own holes, this sign requires 2 posts to install, not just one. This should be in the description of the product so customers know what they are buying, but it isn't. The bolt holes are very small too, so they didn't take the bolts we had on hand that we use for our other signs. I will be looking for smaller bolt at the hardware store today. Otherwise, it's perfect and just what we needed!"
2,A Noble Effort,"I don't know if the weather was bad this particular weekend, or what, but outside of maybe Dr. John, none of the artists on this live one sound very involved with the music. And several, in fact almost all of them, are usually at their best recorded live. Hats off to Ben and Jerry's for attempting to revive a grand old folk tradition but, at least on this project, something's missing. Each of the performers, and songs, are better heard elsewhere."
3,Full tear down and rebuild/NOT,"This book is helpful but does lack information on replacing parts that are common replacements on Suburbans. Also sometimes pictures do not have arrows specifying which part it is actually showing. Since this is the only book I have found that covers Suburbans, it is helpful but I hope someday someone will do a complete teardown and use better pictures and/or drawings."
1,Received wrong book,"Close but no banana. Vendor sent me the wrong book, but it was used and the price was very low, so that's okay. Never responded to my email which wasn't cool, but whatever.Finally got the book from another vendor and it was great, sealed in plastic and only $3. more than the used one I had originally ordered. Amazon...you have a great service. Much appreciated."
3,Very Nice For Beginners,"I'm a huge fan of Liz Green's and give five stars to most all her work, and this is a very nice presentation. Having said that, this product is geared to the beginner or perhaps towards someone who wants to present a chart to someone else with images. I shall give it to a girlfriend astrologer who does readings and perhaps she can get more use out of it in her consultations. It is probably better for visually oriented people."
2,Not what I thought it would be,IT was not at all what I thought it would be. For some reason I thought it was a simple tarot deck with astrological designs on the cards. This is much much different than that. This is simply a deck used for astrology and I am not impressed with that. Time consuming!!!!!!!Better left to the Very Experienced!!!
3,3.5 Stars,"All Hail, Great Purple One.In this tale, Mother Goose's book gets eaten by a bookworm and she needs the gangs help to reconstruct the damaged pages.The video is short and from one of the old shows. If you have see more recent Barney's you will note that this is a different Mother Goose than now appears.That said, this video is popular with my 2 and 4 year olds. (Boy and Girl.) However, if you really want a treat, check out ""Rhyme Time Rhythm"" on DVD. Alot more poems and a cooler set along with additional materials."
3,not as good as the rest,"My son loves all Barney videos, but this one did not hold his attention at all. The rhythms might be great for some children, but my child wants to sing. When we put this video in, he asks for his other Barney videos."
4,"everything you ever wanted to know, etc.","An astounding and entertaining history of gum from the days of chewing wax novelties to the ultra-sophisticated multi-flavor bubble gums of the modern world. Very upfront about the less savory history of the industry, but hardly depressing."
5,A great publication for all horse owners!,"After subscribing to the Quarter Horse Journal, Reiner, and other large breed publications, hands down the Paint Horse Journal is the better read for articles, advertisements, and happenings. The biggest win with the PHJ is the advertisement are not intrusive in the article layouts. I have experienced difficulties even finding the articles in the QHJ and Reiner magazine because the advertising obscures the body of the articles. The PHJ's layout and design should be award winning. The article content is always fresh, helpful and informative without being redundant. I have been a subscriber for years and have yet seen a duplication in content. 5 out of 5 stars!"
2,I LOOOVE This mag,"I really enjoyed reading the articles in the Paint Horse Journal, I own a 7 year old paint gelding and hope to broaden my barn to a large paint training stable. This magazine connects me to the paint horse world and really helps with my horse buying."
1,A waste of $10.00 I bought (5) books on this topic based on Amazon reviews!,"A waste of $10.00 I bought (5) books on this topic based on Amazon reviews! I felt like I was reading something anyone could of written....gee... ""I went to the store today and read Fiber One cereal"" was the heathiest!""Duh who doesn't read labels these days! Then she tells us how she takes over 20 supplements and many of them in Extreme amounts! She tries to write this book like she's your friend....I just could NOT get past her self indulgent book... She basically changed her whole life for menopause....she clearly has no kids and has all the time in the world to research this....she thinks she's being helpful. BUT any good blogger For FREE could tell you what she wrote in this book!!! I will write a review on the other 4 books and ALL of them make this nothing more than a waste of my time and 10.00"
5,Outstanding Resource,"I have read 4 other books on menopause and find this to be by far the most practical and helpful. The author has done a fabulous job of condensing a monumental amount of research into a very readable and easily digestible form. Each aspect of menopause is treated separately and followed by practical, natural alternatives to hormone treatment therapy. It is a wonderful resource which gives the specifics of ""what to take, ""how"" and ""why"", recommended doses, and the doses that the author found to be effective. This is the first book that I have read that is actually encouraging about menopause and does not make me feel as though I'm going to deteriorate irreparably if I don't take hormone replacement therapy. I am grateful to the author for sharing the results of her own personal experience and research."
4,el romantico por excelencia,"Para mi Gustavo Adolfo Becquer es el mejor poeta romantico sin comparacion. Refinado e intimista, magico a veces, te transporta al mundo de los deseos y los suenos. Yo personalmente prefiero su obra poetica a la prosa; quien no ha leido las rimas de Becquer? para adolescentes enamorados y para el resto de la gente que sepa apreciar la buena literatura."
2,The Nero software that comes with this drive sucks,"Both the box and the manual say this drive can write and read DVD+R/RW discs. When I try to copy a home made video from a DVD-R disc to a DVD+R disc, I keep getting an error saying ""the disc required for this compilation is DVD-R/RW"". Even after I updated both the firmware and the Nero Express 6 software to the Nero Express 6 Ultra Edition Update, I still have the same problem. It seems the Nero software is the one to blame because I don't have any problem when I try to copy using either DVD Decryptor or DVD Shrink. A Nero Tech support rep routed my call to Nero.com which only let me talk to them if I agreed to tell them my Visa card number first, so I decided to hang up on them."
1,Did the writer really research this?,This book does not do it's titles name justice. You really wonder whether the writer is chinese or not. I obviously think not. I don't even think they are even Asian. I expected the content to be better. I wonder how this person is coping sexually? And they are trying to give instructions to us?
3,okay its sorta good,the songs suffer for a reason and our time to shine and 3 other songs are the only good songs. d.c.p. and the other songs are 50% good and less !!.
3,Only 2 songs were tight,"This is not his best CD, The Last Saint, and Ghetto Precha are his best CD's yet, those are some definate trunk beaters, and tight lyrics"
4,Ain't nuttin wrong 2 be a demon cap peela'!,"Hey, if you're looking for an uplifting, positive Christian album...this is it. It's a step better than Ghetto Preacha, and it introduces the hottest duo in Christian Rap: F.T.F.I bought this one along with Bruthaz Grimm's ""And things will never be the same"". This album is the kind that really grabs you at the start. After you listen to it a while, you really see beyond the beats and lyrics and feel God's message through Bennie Lee Tucker (D.C.P.)On a scale of 1 to 5 though, I give this a four, simply because it isn't a full strong album, but about 80%. Pick Our Time to Shine, D.C.P., Woe Stories, Life Becoming Mo of a Woe, On the Ball, Thru Wit It, and So What....well then, you'd have a 101% cd.This is definitely a must buy, though...and I encourage you to purchase more from the best Christian Rap Label...Grapetree."
4,A worthy and worthwhile rendering of Ockeghem,"Performed simply - a sincere and earnest effort to clearly perform Ockeghem's simple, unadorned harmonies.A worthy and worthwhile rendering of (some of) Ockeghem's compositions.Rated four to four and a half stars.Ken Cybulska"
5,"A lot of fun, and surprisingly educational","I bought this book because I like Richard Hoffer's boxing writing for Sports Illustrated and it seemed to have an entertaining concept. It did not disappoint on either score, it is well-written and filled with fun stories of his travels around the country, poking into different gambling venues. He includes accounts of his own considerable wins and more considerable losses.Somewhere along the way, I realized I was learning something. The book does not stop with well-known games like state lotteries and casinos. He buys a ticket in a meat raffle in Minnesota, finds an underground poker game in Salt Lake City and visits a slot machine manufacturers' convention. He discovers a depth and variety in contemporary American gambling, something you won't find in mainstream accounts or standard histories. Something's going on out there and Richard Hoffer got a look at it."
4,Conspiracy in Mecca,"This was a great book, as was Third Reich by David, not very long, but the content was fantastic.If America does not wake up fast and realize what is happening in our great country the muslims are going to take over, actually I am not sure that it may already be to late.Sad to say but this is not a religion but a way of life, an ugly way of life with little or no respect for women or anyone that does not believe in their (men) way of thinking.Recently I spent 15 days in Portugal, well, 700 years ago the Templar's chased the muslims out of their country, as of my visit in Jan-Feb 2012 I did not see one muslim, if they could do it 700 years ago, how about hiring them to do it today in America. Yeah! Portugal job well done."
1,Worthless bigotry!,"Short, hateful, totally biased lacking both understanding of history and of Islam. One could just as easily make the same kind of case about any religion or ideology by ignoring perspective and fairness. Books like this increase hate and fear but certainly not truth or understanding. read Esposito's recent ""Unholy Wars"" instead."
5,Obsession: A Novel by Kathi Mills - Macias,"What a page turner. I could not put it down. Talk about Obsession. This book is a wonderful mystery/romance. It keeps your interest from the very first page. The struggle with finding the truth to her father's death, dealing with a committment versus true love as well as God's will for her life creates a main character that truly comes alive. This book also deals with a curiosity and search to find Christ that many will be able to relate to. I loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery."
4,The Midas Touch,"Kenneth Hagin's book, The Midas Touch, covers the subject of giving from several angles. Tithing is addressed very well as well as offerings. His explanation of the 30, 60, and 100 fold return is well given. He addresses some of the excesses we see taking place with radio and television ministries. The only reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating was that I feel this section is somewhat out dated and he did not come close to capturing what we face today in these excesses. All in all, it is a book for every Christian."
5,excellent,This is truly an excellent book for any one interested in biblical prosperity; the why and how are very well presented.
1,Huge disappointment.,"I ordered these as a stocking stuffer for my son, who has been playing the drums in a band for 5 years. They are very cool looking, but one of them broke after 5 minutes of play. I expected a LOT more of Zildjian. I feel like I threw away money and my son was very disappointed."
3,I bought this for my Daughter,It was OK! But why put such a lousy paint job on something that will fade after use(especially on your hands). the sticks work well BUT (the paint) will peel out on your hand and mark your instruments.ALSO please note the sticks handle were made of wood! and the only part nylon were the tips OK!!!In the end I repainted the stick and re-clear coated it and no problem after that.
1,Unreliable,"I ordered a lousy pair of drumsticks for my nephew, after two weeks i contacted seller, and only then did they ""discover"" they had never actually sent my crummy drumsticks. It took me telling them i'd write a negative review, and then instead of overnighting me a pair of drumsticks, they canceled my order, so i got nuthin'. I'll never consider using them. Ever."
4,Good start to a series,"""The Summoning"" is the first in a three part series of the return of the City of Shade to the Forgotten Realms. Shade has been in the demi-plane of Shadow for the past 17 centuries. The story revolves around an elf desperately trying to redeem himself and coping with a newfound power that threatens to consume him.This book also has appearances of Elminster and Storm Silverhand. I found Denning's portrayal of Eliminster a trifle annoying.All in all I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the other two. I think that Denning could have done a better job a fleshing out the characters but he may be saving that for later on the story. This book may not be one of Denning's greatest works but it is still worth reading for any fan of the Forgotten Realms."
1,Why did I read the whole thing?,"This is one if the worst books I have ever read, no kidding. The plot is boring, the characters are NOT the Epitome of pleasant and likeable, the villains just cardboard uber nastiest, and so on. Oh, and the whole world, no universe, no creation, NO MAGIC IT SELF is threatened! (Gasp) If you are masochistic, this books for you!"
3,needs music only option,"the workout is fine, not too complicated but gets heart rate up. loathe that there is no option to turn the grating voice off and leave just music. when will fitness dvds creators realize the impact this option has on something that is meant to be repeated over and over again. besides this, i give this routine a thumbs up."
1,Not worth it.,"I recently purchased this product, and although the product arrived in record time, the quality of such was not to my liking. The nose screw was not flexible at all, and the plastic was not smooth. The plastic all up to the top of the nose screw was babrbed, thus making it painful to put in and imposible as well. To make matters worse, when attepmting to bend the nose screw for inscertion, it snapped in half. I am completey dissatisfied with this product, and reccomend going to peircing paghoda or walmart and purchase a nose screw of better quality and at a better price."
4,Learn mysteris and horrors of Dragons.,"Learn the myths surrounding the dragons, discover their secrets, and unlock the mysteries that surround these grand monsters. Presented as a compilation of notes and stories by dragon-hunting adventurers, Draconomicon features details on roleplaying dragons for DMs, statistics for infamous dragons including Tiamat, new dragon species, dragon magic, and four short adventures involving the great wyrms.This book is interesting to read and have many usefull information for DM, who like to terrorize players by dragons."
2,You get what you pay for,"I have Adobe 6.0 professional. Most of the time I use Adobe to convert file to PDF. I bought this software hoping to get cheaper product for our company new computer with the comparable quality. The software does convert the file to PDF. However, it considerbly increases the file size.I convert some documents using both Adobe and this software to compare.Adobe compressed the file from 200 KB to 20 KBThis software increase the file size from 200 KB to 688 KB!Changing the setting also makes no difference.Not recommend this software if you're looking for the product to compress the file."
1,Waste of money,"First of all, the required registration and fingerprinting of your machine is quite intrusive and cumbersome.Second, in converting pdf to Word files, it doesn't really do any useable formatting that can be easily editted, instead it creates a bunch of text boxes all over the page (rather then using tabs or tables). I was tring to convert a resume to a different format, working with a pdf original. In the end I had to convert it to plain text and start formatting from scratch, which I could have done just using the Adobe Acrobat text copy tool. Save your money, I wish I had done some research first."
3,"Good book! Not great, but good!","Major Stewart tells a good tale and holds the readers interest throughout. His writing style is slightly wooden and his characters are paper thin, but this book was worth spending an afternoon on.The editing could have been better. Mr Stewart obviously knows quite a bit about flying, but could use a little qualified help when witing about things that deal with ground combat and military small arms. If I were the author, or at least the editor, I would have used a competent proof-reader instead of editing the manuscript with a spell-checker.All in all, I think that ""Shattered Bone"" was much better."
3,Seen it all before,"Yet another book that is so much of a ""seen it before"" syndrome it is nearly sickening. The ""evil"" Arabs, the ""humanizing"" female agent, the ""supermen"" american military, and the ""ultimate"" weapon. There is nothing original about this book - but at least it is a decently written derivative work.Are there no original plots left in the techno-thriller category or are us fans forced to feed on leftover warm mash (and pretend with enjoy it) like the Star Wars and Star Trek fans."
3,New is not necessarily better,"I was hoping to get an up-to-date version of the Hammond International World Atlas (1973), with the same format but with the many changes that have made the old atlas obselete. I found it very convenient to have the cities, counties, departments, etc, pertaining to a country to be in the same location as the map. The new format, with all names listed in the back, is not very handy. I miss the topographical maps, which were much more useful than the aerial photos now included. My request: If you ever go back to the old format, let me know and I will order immediately, and give my new atlas to the grandchildren."
4,No flags,"If you're looking for illustrations of country flags, as I was, you can skip this atlas. There are none. Zero. I have to refer to my 1988 Hammond Atlas to see flags, and that is largely outdated.Otherwise it's a good atlas. High quality maps and other useful information. Best value for the money, if you don't care to see country flags."
2,Read before buying as USED TEXTBOOK,"Ok. First thing first, THIS BOOK REQUIRES A LIC. KEY WHICH (at this time) IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE SEPARATELY. I know, I called Prentice Hall, and while they sell Lic. keys for some of their other books, they don't for this book.You will not be able to log on to the website to take the tests. Lic. keys are not renewable, so if you have a used textbook, the lic. key won't work!I made the mistake of buying this book used and ended up having to spend more money buying the new textbook. If you do buy this book used (for personal use, I guess) make sure it has the 3-cds which are supposed to come with the book. The vendor did not mention or include the 3 Cds."
1,Stay away!!!,"This is a rip off!! Instructors use this ONCE so there are no buy backs. Gaskin will make her profit and the students are paying!! refuse to buy, or form a co-op like my class did!I would give zero stars if possible!"
1,This book does NOT meet the mark!!!,"This is a warning for college instructors who are considering using this text. More importantly, for students who don't know anything about computers, this is not the right book to read. There are several reasons not to purchase this book. Specifically, this book is not helpful for three main reasons: (1) There are several typographical errors, (2) the definitions are NOT detailed enough, and (3) the practices at the end of the chapter are NEITHER detailed NOR consistent with the terms throughout the text. I regret having spent $70 for this textbook."
1,No direction provided,This DVD lacks instruction. It starts with the instructor already dancing with her two back-up dancers or students. I started having no idea how to begin and ended still having no idea how to do this. Don't waste your money!
1,Redshift version 1.0,"This version was definitely NOT user-friendly, and I took 2 years of Astronomy in college. For that reason I am considering the Starry Night series for my next Astronomy program."
4,Just Loaded and Played,"In spite of some people having trouble, I decided to take a chance on RedShift -- so far so good. I also had to load QuikTime, but it was on the disk so it was no problem.I've just been playing with it for about 30 minutes and it seems pretty nice. I might rate it higher after I've worked with it some more.Although my primary interest is our Moon (LunarPhasePro by Gary Nugent), I wanted a program covering everything else. This looks like a good start."
5,redshift 5,"redshift is seriously the top of the line for anyone who wants a space program.. i've tried out several others and none can compare! redshift has multitudes of features and a plethora of information that is near impossible to exhuast! before this i only owned redshift 3 and i doubt that i have even looked up everything on that cd by this point, some 4 years later!redshift is the maximum."
3,Not quite Oregon specific,"I am planning a trip to the Oregon coast this summer and greatly anticipated the arrival of this book. It seemed a perfect fit for my needs. My initial reaction to the book is disappointing.The book is organized by photographic subject such as waterallfs, shorelines, valleys, sunset, etc. It gives advice o the lens selection, camera placement, and exposure for photographing each subject. At the end of each topic is a list of Oregon specific locations for photographing these subjects.I can find plenty of books on how to photograph waterfalls or sunsets. What I was hoping for was advice on specific beaches or locations in Oregon. This book will not give you that. Look for places on the web for ""Photograph America"" and ""Phototraveler"" for location specific advice."
3,Not quite Oregon specific,"Sorry to borrow the same title as Michael Johnson, but I could easily say ""ditto"". To say it in my own words, I think if you changed a few of the photos and some references, this book could easily be called ""Photographing Washington"" or ""Photographing California"". In fact, if you replaced the references of oceans to lakes, you could almost call it ""Photographing Michigan"".The point being is that the book has chapters dedicated to different aspects of photography (oceans, waterfalls, forests, etc.) and then lists some very general references to places in Oregon to find these, like ""Whalehead Beach"", or some state parks. But these could just as easily be anywhere - California, Washington, etc. There is no specific information like ""take this trail in the spring in the morning for the best waterfall shot""."
1,Totally Useless,"I have tried to play this DVD on 3 different players with no luck. If I insert it into the DVD on my computer, it tried to install a .EXE file. Too expensive to return. It is not a NORMAL DVD. Read into that what you want. Will not be returning for anything else."
5,Brasilian romance in Spanish,"Although this CD doesn't include any emphatic numbers like Antologia 2's ""El Preso #9"" or ""La Biblia,"" it doesn't disappoint in delivering the romance one grows to expect from Brasil's Nelson Ned. The most romantic number in this album comes in the form of ""Si las flores pudieran hablar,"" a song as gently rendered as ""Dejenme si estoy llorando"" in Antologia 2. It also includes a magical version of the much-recorded ""La Diferencia,"" a song written by Ned's friend and Mexico's legendary Juan Gabriel. Except for a few words of English in ""Happy Birthday, My Darling,"" all of the songs are in Spanish, and they're all good."
5,Wonderful,"For those who love Paul Wilbur, this is a wonderful blend of new and old songs. For those who have never heard of Paul Wilbur and his Messianic style of worship music, this is a wonderful album for someone to be introduced to Paul Wilbur's music. The overall theme of this album is a great introduction to Messianic Hebrew Christian style of music. This album touches me down deeply. This album also brings a great sense of joy.I love to sing along with it."
1,Don't be fooled: this ain't Jewish,"This guy has got some talent, a few stunning songs...but don't be fooled. Jewish wrapping paper, Christian guts.Jews, stay away."
1,not water resistant,Leaked after first swim in the pool. My last expedition survived hundreds of swims. Will be returning asap. Not sure if i'll go timex again.
4,A small gift for my outdoorsy husband.,"He needed a new all around watch and is very happy with this one. He tends to be a bit hard on watches, and where others have been banged around and broken(or the alarm gets stuck and you can't change the alarm timer), it is still doing well."
4,Confusing description of features,"I returned this watch immediately for one simple reason. The phrase ""99-lap counter"" in the description was not clear to me, and I bought it expecting to be able to review the lap times. That isn't possible, and should be made clear in the description because it is such a common feature on sporting watches. I had otherwise been looking forward to using this watch, and still think it's a great watch, but I need lap recall with the lap counter."
1,No split recall--are you kidding me?,"Honestly, I thought I was missing something so I read the directions twice. No. I wasn't...there's no indication that you can review split times. After going online to see if there was some other soul that cracked the code, I was disappointed to read other reviews on this topic. Then I actually called Timex because I thought that this was such a strange oversight. NO DATA RECALL. What's the point of taking splits if you can't review the split after the event is completed? I don't get it. I guess that Timex assumes that you will glance at the display during the 10 second delay with a notepad and pen in hand and record the splits as you take them. Well, this watch isn't going to the San Diego Rock and Roll marathon with me. It's going back to Target. Try again Timex. I was a big fan of your watches, but you lost me on this one. Not good. A waste of my time, money, and gas."
4,Watch,This watch suits me just fine! I just recently purchased this watch for the third straight time! The two previous watches lasted me about two or three years each. As long as Timex keeps selling this watch I'll continue to buy it.
2,Not as durable as I was led to believe,Within a few weeks there were many scuffs on the watch face. It had gotten to the point where I had to angle my wrist in a certain position to be able to see the time.The leather band literally disintegrated after 8 months of wear.
5,Timex Watch for Swimmer,"My hubby is hard to please, believe me. He loves this watch. Perfect for his daily swim work-outs. He says: ""It's simple and does what I want it to do. I like the color and I like the leather band which is holding up well. It is vastly improved from the previous Timex ""water resistant"" watches."" I'm so pleased that I finally bought him something for his birthday that he really likes."
2,"pretty good watch, lousy band","I bought this watch retail for $35 because as a clinician, I need to wash my hands all day. The watch is working out alright, but the watchband is lousy. It bleeds brown die all over my white clothes and papers. Why would Timex put a band that does not tolerate getting wet on a watch that is designed to be water resistant?"
2,band broke in under 3 months,Band broke in less than three months. Very disappointing. I bought five of these watches as gifts. Two still have bands intact. Neither of those were ever worn (too small). The other ones were used as daily watches. All those bands have failed. Very disappointing.
2,Bad Watch Band,"Bought this watch three months ago prior to a military deployment, used it for two months, primarily to keep time while runnning and doing timed exercises. The band broke right after finishing a run at the loop where it connects to the watch. I've had similar watches in the past that have been treated much less delicately and have had no issues. A real disappointment."
2,"Good watch, but . . .","It has a good strong alarm, and the three alarms with daily/weekday/weekend options are very handy. Also not a huge watch, very well-sized for smaller arms like mine. I had one for a couple of years that finally go too scratched up. I replaced it with another, and after one diop in the pool the crystal completely fogged up. So much for the 100 mete, good for anything up to and including snorkel diving!"
4,Keeps on digiting!,"I first purchased this model at a PX in Afghanistan and am now on the third one after the band on my second one (acuired in Iraq) gave up the ghost. It is light-weight, goes through metal detectors without having to be removed, survives water and sand, and keeps great time. As a no-nonsense timepiece it can't be beat. My law partner has put away his fancy, expensive watch and purchased this model out of envy for its utility. Now that I've retired from the Army I expect this watch to last much longer since its face will not be etched by blowing sand or other flying junk."
2,They don't fit,I purchased these cages for my Thule Hitching post rack. The cages do not fit around the arms of the hitching post. I went to Wal-mart and bought and assortment of bungee cords for less than $10. I have a no sway solution and extra security for the bikes above the built in rubber straps.
3,Works -- but EATS PAINT,"We bought a couple of these for our Thule rack. While they do indeed work, they also chew up the paint on the seat tube pretty badly (for non-experts in bike frame anatomy, the seat tube is the vertical part of the bike frame below the seat post). I wish someone had mentioned this to me before I started using mine -- my wife and I chewed through paint and decals on both of our road bikes and mountain bikes before we realized the cause. I would recommend placing some sort of soft but clingy barrier between this accessory and your frame (for example some Grip Liner - 12"" x 4' Black Cushioned Shelf Liner by Contact Brand)"
5,A good read!,"A lot of topics are discussed inside this book of poetry. Robin Cook, in 'Old School' fashion describes the many pitfalls of the post-modern human condition: first and foremost among them, materialism and greed. He reminds readers of the pitiful condition of our environment but provides hope that everything will be well cared for shortly. His unique perspectives provoke thought and discussion, broadening the minds of his readers. Many of the poems are written with a deep understanding of Christian fundamentals and impute knowledge upon the reader, (even long-time Christians I suspect,) which I am, and which he did. Old School is atypical of many poetry books because it's straight-forward and understandable, not vague. I highly recommend this book and rate it PG13."
3,Al-Naqba,"Although an early work of the author, and readily exposing the Israeli-Palestinian sides to the issues in the West Bank, etc. with their seeming non-resolvable nature, the book became a bit more documentary in style and predictable than likely intended. Well portrayed was the manner of life that the marriage of a Bedouin and Arab of differing historical backgrounds would try of form and how this would engage present-day reality in the region. The conflict there is really a spiritual one centering on a Jewish history from Abraham onward colliding with Islamic conquest beginning in the 7th century. One seeks the will and honor of the God of the Bible, the other Allah."
5,Tapestry Eyeglass Holder safety,"These keeps the glasses clean and safe. You can find your glasses easy as the holder is safe and you can see it anywhere you place it.Plus it keeps the galsses safe from falling or letting your cats get them. I have 4 at home. one in the bedrrom, one by the computer, one in the kitchen and one in the closet to keep if something would happen to the holder but for7 years they have stayed very good and clean."
2,Too small!,"I have a similar holder and love it. This one however is too narrow and my glasses don't fit. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost me so much to do so. Save your $$$ and buy a different one, especially if ur glasses are not tiny."
2,"Too small for my glasses, kind of cheap","The holder fits one pair of my glasses, but it is a tight fit. The other pair won't fit at all.The outside of the stand is quite well constructed but some of the fuzzy material inside is coming off after just a few days.All that being said -- at this low price if your glasses fit it is probably worth it."
4,Tapestry Eyeglasses Holder,I purchased this tapestry eyeglass holder as a Christmas present for my wife. Years ago she purchased a similar item for me and I have used it constantly to hold my computer glasses. She uses her at her bedside to hold her glasses while sleeping. The design is pretty and colorful and the lining helps cushion and protect her glasses.The price was very reasonable and we received it before Christmas which was great!Any glasses wearer should enjoy the use of this product.
4,eye glass holder with class,I needed something for my desk at work to hold my regular glasses while wearing my 'computer' glasses. This looks professional.
4,Very handy,"This is a handy holder for my reading glasses. I bought (2). I have one by my bed, and (1) in the kitchen (for recipes) so I have glasses in the places where I will be reading!"
3,Clever idea to have a stand up glasses holder,This is an ok product. The quality is a little cheap but the price wasn't too much so really can't complain too much. It is a bit small for glasses that are bigger than the modern fad - in other words normal glasses fit a bit too snug.
5,Same Shania.,"Shania is just naturally beautiful. Her style of music is so wonderful. It's .......... country and that's they way I like it. ""I'm Gonna Get You Good"" is only the tip of the iceburg. ""Up!"" Will be fabulous."
1,Re-hash,"This is just a re-hash of her previous material, only this time the lyrics are dumber than before. This lady has so many songs with ! and () in the title. What is her problem? This is nothing but corporate garbage that is intended to sell in large quantities. She could at least try something new and fresh. This cutesy, silly stuff is lame for someone her age."
1,We waited 5 years for this??!!!,"This song is nothing more but a remix version of her single ""That Don't Impress Me Much"". Awful lyrics makes up this predictable-corporate song. For example, she insists to a guy that she doesn't want him for just a night or for just a weekend, but then in the chorus she says she will get him even if it takes all night. My verdict is no growth in this almost 40 year old woman, she writes like a teenager and she is trying badly to have the same impact of COO. Shania and Mutt has now become her worst enemy."
5,great product,I love this product! Keeps my blood sugars low. I take a total of six a day (double dose) for now. I will lower my dose when my blood sugars are normal.
1,Need instructions,"These should have come with Baking instructions....I used my usual receipe for muffins, and filled the cups as directed,but the muffins turned out horribly dry and hard....naturally, I will figure them out and adjust my receipe, but was disappointed, during the holiday breakfast company."
2,Go with T-Fal,This pan does not do well on a ceramic top stove. it warped over medium high heat with food in it. Does not sit level now. Oh Well. The T-Fal brand I ordered at the same time works wonderful and I will be (non)sticking with that from now on.
5,a must see,"Definitely the best film about this notorious man in Russian history. Contrary to cheesy Hollywood versions portraying the monster opposite some youths in love, this film takes you to the reality of Russian ruling class in the early years of XX century. It is not about one person, it shows the agony of the whole system at the dawn of the October 1917 revolution. The Tzar with his weaknesses, the nobles with their arrogance and uselessness, the bureaucrats with their greed; and amongst them all, this strange and horrific figure who appeared out of nowhere as some kind of evil genius or, maybe, a personification of all Russian folk.The film creates incredibly authentic atmosphere of the time, focusing mostly on macabre side(considering the subject). The acting is absolutely superb."
2,don nile,"I found this video to be some what vague, with attempts by the makers to interject bits and pieces of historical film footage just to extend the length of the story, not to enhanced the understanding of Rasputin tremendous influence over the Czar family.I expected a more dramatic effect from the acting and direction to help non-speakers of the Russian language to better understand his historical role.One can get more information by checking out the web sites on the biography of Rasputin."
4,SILEX TECHNOLOGY SX-2000WG Hi-Speed USB 802.11g Wireless Device Server,"I don't know if ""Hi-Speed"" describes this device but it worked with everything that I hooked up to it, including an HP inkjet printer, USB 2.0 hard drive, USB 2.0 memory card reader, USB Mouse, Cannon scanner and an Epson scanner. Large files seem to take a long time to transfer, even for 802.11g speeds. The ""Wireless"" interface works OK, though the signal seems to drop off significantly at 15 feet or more, but it works great where my printer is only just across the room. I was able to configure and use the device through both the built-in wireless and wired ethernet interfaces with no problems. If you need more distance, just connect the device to a wireless router."
4,Great Wireless USB device!,"I use this device to extend my HP scanner to the opposite side of my home office. Cabling is not an option. It works great! Automatically starts when the scanner one-touch buttons are pressed. I only wish is had an auto-connect feature, so when I started the computer, it would auto-link. Currently, you have to go to the software interface and select ""connect"" to link-up. Everything else is perfect."
1,"Software problem solved, switching problem remains","If you have more than one computer in your house on a home network, you want this functionality. A suggestion and a warning. If you get this, you may find you just can't get it to set up. Go to the silex website and download the latest software. I found mine was several versions behind. With the latest software, setup was completed without a problem. BUT, you have to know that when one computer is connected to the printer, no other can connect. It goes like this. I need to print. Huh, the software can't connect. Hey Marge, can you right click on that icon in the tray and disconnect from the printer? Sure, Bob. Three minutes later... Bob, I need to print now, can you disconnect? Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. That's ridiculous, don't you think?"
1,Not Mac friendly,"I bought this device so that I could scan wirelessly on a Canon MP830 which is currently connected to an Airport Base Station. I have been a Mac user for 20 years and this is the most unintuitive device I have ever tried to connect to a Mac. I spent about 5 hours trying, including 2 emails to Silex customer support. I finally gave up!"
3,Yaawwwnnnn! Good For Late Night Viewing.,"I spotted this four-pack of romance movies on the bargain rack at my nearby Ross Store and bought it for late night viewing. Well, it's four lightweight romantic Feel-good comedies (on two double-sided discs) with nothing much extra going for them. I'd say that ""Forget Paris"" and ""The Goodbye Girl"" are the best and ""Her Alibi"" and ""Best Friends"" were down a notch. I've reviewed all of them but under their individual titles. None of the movies are particularly memorable, but for late night viewing they beat most of the stuff that's on cable TV and there are no commercial breaks. All are well done, I might add. Yaawwwnnnn! Maybe they'll help give a good night's sleep.Gary Peterson"
1,Damaged DVD,"One of the two DVDs was scratched on arrival. I followed the instructions for return to the vendor, but I have had information since then. I have not been supplied with a replacement DVD, nor have I been repaid for the cost incurred in buying and returning the item. Somehow, I find this less than satisfactory."
3,Not the greatest movies,"This is a good way to get all four of these films cheaply, if you need all four. I sort of wish I would have downloaded the two I wanted from iTunes instead."
1,this is not what I ordered,"There were supposed to be 4 movies on this DVD. There were two.I bought it mostly for Forget Paris, and that movie was not on there. There were two copies of Her Alibi on one DVD and two copies of the Goodbye Girl on the other. I only spent $9 getting the DVD and could not see spending the money to send it back."
3,"Good, but....","The book contains a lot of valid points, observations and information. However, the content is marred a bit by a flawed layout/arrangement.Instead of chapters and sections, it seems to just run on from one point to the next, with not much in the way of demarcation between areas. More like a series of articles than a book, but even books based on series of articles manage to group them together based on primary focus or main point.That said, still a worthwhile read."
1,"What a bunch of half-true, mind-numbing hysteria ...","Don't you get it? Don't waste your time reading this tripe ... Mr. Willis discredits anything worthy he would share with the title of his book. I thought 'conservatives', i.e. Republicans were the 'hate mongers'. Read something by George Will or Larry Elder instead."
5,Required Readings,"This is the type of book that the voters need to be confronted with. Sad to say is that this country is in a lot of trouble right now, and unless we are willing to do something about it, it's going to get worse. This book really discusses that factor, and regardless of it's slightly misguiding title, it's not republicans he's talking about, but rather Republicans, the big business man who've bought our country and are now running it via corporate interest and lobbiests. Unfortunetly, this will only be read by fellow liberals, who are already angry enough. This book really deserves to be read by the moderate in your family, or as a gift for the republican we all keep as the skelaton in the closet. It's not radical left agenda, it's just a plea to live up to what our country stands for. Our forefathers created the most incredible idea ever seen by men, it's our job to not to let that idea become yet another commodity bought and sold on Wall Street."
1,SHOULD BE ZERO STARS...,"This is everything that is wrong with party politics in America. My party - right or wrong. Forget what is in the best interest of the nation. Much of the writing and the ideas expressed are roughly equivalent to a junior high school understanding. Way too much emotion and ranting, with, as I said before, not enough real analysis of what is good for the country. These people (party politicians) are what is going to destroy America. And it is happening, at a far faster rate that even Rome fell."
1,one sided.... how can you tell?,"yes, the causes of all the worlds evils are the republicans, who have secretely plundered the planets riches in their pursuit of world conquest. please, this is a ridiculous, one sided book. both major parties in this country have serious problems, usually having something to do with partisan politicking, wanting to 'win' for their 'team.' instead of calling the other side names, accusing it of cover ups, etc., maybe, just maybe people could expend the same amount of energy they do 'proving' with 'facts' that each other are wrong in trying to identify actual problems and solutions for them. one sided hate fests like this one are just more vitriolic rhetoric."
1,"In response to ""doomsdayers"" comments.....","I don't have to read the book. All you have to do is read the product description to figure out this guy is an idiot.Signed,Reactionary"
1,worthless,"I tried to look at this book with an open mind, but that was impossible. If you want to convince someone to believe something, you need better people to quote than notorious liars; michael moore and al franken. This book spews nothing but hated filled vomit and I don't reccomend it for anyone. If you accept everything the Looney Left tells you without questioning anything, then by all means waste your money. If you have a brain and think for yourself and don't buy into all the crap from these incredibly radical communists, keep your money and stay far away from this book. People should have to do with their time than to just make money off hatred.Leslie"
1,TOO SMALL,this tiny little fish tank is only good for holding baby fish for a few weeks...and that's only so you have enough time find a seperate tank from the parent/adult fish or in the case of very small fish enough time to grow up enough to keep from being eaten
1,Too Small!!!,No place for the poor bettas to hide! Sure it's neat to see them flare but they get tired! Wouldn't you if you were mad all the time?Also it's WAY too small. Bettas need at least a gallon by themselves. If you want three goto a petstore and get a standard 10 gallon tank and get two dividers (you can even make your own) and put three bettas in that with a HEATER and FILTER. Your fish well be SO much happier!
5,honest music,"it dosn't matter if van ronk is groweling,whispering,crooning,talking,moaning,shouting,or singing like a huge hairy angel,you have to believe what you hear.he sings a song like a cherished friend telling you stories of his experiences,in some historic late night bar.he does frankie's blues like he saw her with the gun.i'm sure he new the guy in dylan's he was a friend of mine.he owns the traditionals he chooses to interpret,but,like a close friend,he'll share.truth and beauty in music?it'll never sell."
4,genuine review,"i'v had this book for acouple of years, i have an OLDER copy i found in an antique store. VERY good book, breaks the metaphysics down to a very physical science, to the point of approximanting the wavelenght of the engeries of the mind, and at the same time keeps the metaphysics intact. the 1919 printing contains a few editing flaws, some of the pages are out of order, but they are still there. this is a book for any and every metaphysics library, none of the new age fluff you find in many books today"
4,Smells great!,"Overall, I've not been all that impressed with this cleanser, but, the only other one I've tried was Arbonne's, which was awesome, yet very expensive. Rinses off well, but skin feels like it has a residue (oil?). Would recommend for oily skin as it does clean well."
2,NO NO,I will certainly not buy this product again. I generally have a little oily face and this face wash dried my face really bad. It was a disaster. Total waste of money.
3,Outdated book,"Huge book with good editoral care. A couple fold in oversized reproductions. Crumblesome to handle.Many, many BW pictures and those glued reproductions on some pages, as was common on old art books. Fainted colours, etc...a heavy book on various aspects.A bit pompous as a matter of fact.Im sure it was a remarkable book on the 70s or even the 80s but for todays reproductions technologies and standarts, it falls short.Pretty good book, but not for the only Rockwell book on the shelf."
4,Excellent,"I have to say at the outset that I bought this book by mistake. I have a large, cocktail table-sized, cloth hard-bound compendium of Rockwell illustrations and was looking for a second copy to give to family. I didn't realize when I ordered it that this product was a 'tiny' version. For what it is, however, it is excellent; my wife loves it and looks through it often. It's a good guide for someone looking for a handy but inexpensive Rockwell reference in their library."
5,"Ohhh, for the good old days",There really isn't such a thing as 'the good old days.' But thisfantastic book makes me want to believe these days did exist.I'm glad I bought it.Morris C
4,Reluctant Readers will enjoy,"Boys and Girls should both enjoy this book about Meg and Edward. Twins as different as night and day discover that going to seperate schools actually bring them closer to understanding each other. Clics, parents, fake boyfriends, and really bad music make this an enjoyable read for any 'Tween."
1,Buyers beware......,"Do not buy this product. I have had problems getting it to work on my new laptop and spent days with Orinoco customer support. It appears the Orinoco product are not well designed and do not always work well with win2000. Orinoco blames microsoft and refuses to take back the product, how awkward..."
4,Double Slot offense,This is a great offense! It features a strong passing game that is fairly easy to implement. The running game is simple and effective because it is set up by the pass. It's well written and very complete.
4,LED Gooseneck light- BNC connector,The light is as it was described. The goose neck is flexible and will stay where you bend it. It does not drop like some of the cheap gooseneck lights.
3,Could be better,"For the price, this item is a disappointment. It works with my Furman power conditioner which has a BNC connector and switch on the back to turn it on/off. After installing it, what I noticed is that the weight of the light causes the goose neck to bend and it doesn't stay in the position you aim it. The light on the end unplugs, which allows it to swivel. This helps to aim the light where you want, and I suppose you could buy a replacement head. My other major complaint is that the light flickers. There is no dimmer is use, but the light still flickers like a florescent light. The Furman LED front panel lights do not do this."
5,Innovation at it's finest,I went to high school with Nick and Richard Daratzian (Nick's old body). They started out with Rock Service and after Richard died went on to reform as The Nickolus Tremulis Band. A very eclectic R & B sound. They played the local scene here in Chicago back in the late 70's and 80's. I rate any album by Nick as 10 stars out of 5. Nick is a cool headed extremely friendly guy and deserves all the best. GET HIS STUFF BACK IN PRINT ASAP!!!
5,Great Deck for First-timers!!!,I am a beginner. I have adapted well to the cards. They are brightly colored and very appealing to the senses.
3,"""New and Improved"" Artwork is a disappointment","I'm very satisfied with the seller, but as far as the manufacturer goes, why treat the ancient art of the Tarot like Tide and make it new and improved? They've managed to wash away the charm and authenticity of wonderful artwork by ""redoing"" it making all the images a litter crisper, more in focus and brightening the colors. I would have never given up my 30 year old deck except that it had been used so much the cards were sticking together."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"I suppose that I expected this deck to be an even brighter, more ""radiant"" Universal Waite deck. The Universal Waite deck, of course, still used Pamela Colman Smith's art from the Rider-Waite, only with better coloring than the original RW. The Radiant Rider-Waite Tarot is NOT Colman's pictures. They are far uglier, simpler, garish, and the whole thing feels like a bad dream in comparison to the real thing. As a professional tarot card reader, I'll see how my clients like it, but I won't be buying another one of these decks."
4,Radiant Splendour,"The long awaited Radiant Rider-Waite Tarot once again illuminates the illustrations of Pamela Colman Smith. The most popular Tarot deck in history, Smith's illustrations receive excellent embellishment in this splendid edition, a version which will be welcomed by Tarot readers and collectors for years to come."
2,A minority opinion,"Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews of the Radiant Rider-Waite Tarot, I've definitely got a minority opinion, but here goes: I was terribly disappointed in this deck. Yes, the colors are vibrant. Yes, the symbolism is identical to the classic Rider-Waite. But the images themselves possess none of the artistry of the original. They are poorly executed copies. The faces of the people and archetypes in particular are dull, expressionless, lifeless. Consequently I couldn't connect with the cards at all. If anything, they gave me new appreciation for my old Rider-Waite deck, yellowed and tattered as it is."
1,RADIANT INCOMPLETE,"Ok, so after reading the reviews I thought that I'd love this deck. There were some reviews that talked about missing pages from the booklet but I didn't think that would be a big concern. The deck arrived in great condition, wrapped and apparently new. I went through every card and when I reached the suit of cups I realized that it was missing about 5 cards. I thought they'd be mixed in with the rest of the cards. I didn't have many left and this concerned me. I went through the rest of the cards and what do you know, the last suit was missing 75% of the cards. NO JOKE.I contacted Amazon and filed a return.The colors are bright and pretty, but the deck is not as pretty as the Universal Rider Waite. Plus, it was missing a large amount of cards :/I'd say, If you like it, order it but be aware that it might be missing cards."
5,Bright Tarot Deck,"This deck is great because it's the traditional design by Rider-Waite, but the colors are so much brighter. Great Deck for learning and for advanced Tarot practitioners."
5,The PERFECT RWS Deck!!,"FAR superior to the Universal Waite or the ""regular"" RWS deck. Colors are BEAUTIFUL, VIBRANT and ENGAGING. If you're going to buy a traditional deck, THIS IS IT, look no further!!"
4,priestess' face too hard,"i love the cards, the color, even the ""new book"" smell--but i was terribly disappointed with the changes they made to the high priestess' face. she looks nothing like the original, mystical, youthful priestess. she looks angry, tired, lined, hard, and old, and very unhappy. that threw me off and made me doubt the entire deck--i wondered if i was imagining negative energy or what. i use the priestess as my significator whenever i do a reading for myself, and her face made me not want to even touch the cards. i also have the original priestess tattooed on my arm, so i could be a little biased."
4,first set,It is my first set of the Rider-Waite cards. They came in good time. No problems-except maybe one. They are VERY SLIPPERY cards. Other than that they were a good choice.
4,Awesome Worship,"I rate this album Four Stars because of the awesome songs of worship and praise to the one who deserves all praises. Jesus Christ is great and greatly to be praised and the song ""Great Is Thy Faithfulness"" expresses it beautifully."
1,Italian Countryside mug rim chips easily,"Ordered these mugs to go with our Italian Countryside dinnerware. The mugs are a great size for coffee, and the small diameter helps keep the coffee warm. However, the rims chip too easily and are very, very thin compared to other pieces in this set. I'd say skip these otherwise well designed mugs."
5,excellent story,"This is a story of surprising results to the various investigations. It is full of twists and turns which have the reader guessing. This book caught my attention from the beginning and held it throughout. It is well-written, fast moving, suspenseful. There are a number of explicit sex episodes. The details of Victoria's murder are gruesome. The scenes portraying the serial killer are particularly blood-curdling. Despite this I would not hesitate to recommend Damning Evidence and I eagerly look forward to his second thriller."
1,"Overtaken by events, do not waste your money",After I read the book I Google Michael Scott Speicher. He never survived the initial crash and his body was recovered in 2009 which means the entire book was speculation that was proved to be wrong. The book is the perfect example to the fact that you can see whatever you want to see in a set of data or events.
3,Straight forward interesting account,This is good solid reporting about a very interesting subject. I read the book before the second war in Iraq and would love to read an updated version with later discoveries.
1,"Little fact, lots of speculation.....","This work takes what has been the sad loss of an American fighting man, and would have the reader believe that there have been sinister government cover-ups and plotting to keep evidence of his alleged imprisoment concealed from the public.A nice try at creating a story, but it unfortunately lacks any real evidence to support the tale."
5,"A Sad Tale, but a Must Read","January 16, 1991 is one of those days that will live in infamy. Unfortunately, it is one of the most tragic days because our government turned their backs on one of their own.When you read this story, it will tear at your heart when you see the bad decisions that were made along the way - including bad mistakes by some good people. It is truly an American Tragedy.Yarsinske does a FABULOUS job in covering all perspectives in this story. She is a hallmark writer in the fact that she takes an objective viewpoint in merely searching for the truth and not reciting the ""party-lines"" of any particular viewpoint.This book speaks the truth - good, bad, cold, hard, ugly truth - and is definitely a must read."
1,"Hoax of a story proven false on August 2, 2009","All the conspiracy mumbo jumbo within this book was proven a hoax on August 2, 2009 when Speicher's bones were found a click from the crash site. Knowledgeability and credibility forever lost. She is not a POW MIA expert, as her only resources are unclassified innuendo and poverty stricken Iraqis.Am I too crude? Consider the false hope fiction this story could have drummed up - in family members or friends.Now ask yourself the question, who is the bad one for not checking sources, delving far into conjecture and speculation?"
5,5 stars for no one left behind,"I think all military active and veterans should read this book. Its a shame that the Navy didnt do more to look for Speicher when he went down. AS a Gulf war veteran, this book means alot to me and his name should be kept out there in the public arena until we know what happened to him and what the government failed to do for him. I thought what his wife did was shameless as well. I highly recommend this book. Yarsinske does not speculate, its based on facts, nothing but facts."
1,Horrible Sound Quality!,"I bought this and thought it would be a great convenience. I started listening and tried to turn up the volume so I could hear it, then I realized that not only was the narrator getting louder but the STATIC WAS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER! The sound quality was so bad that turning up the volume just made it worse. They must be recorded at 8 or 16 kbps, if you don't know--that's really bad.$50 or more for this cheaply made, plastic mp3 player with the cheapest, flimsy headphones that they could get. Don't do it, don't buy these. You will regret it. Don't waste your money. Use your own mp3 discs and mp3 player. At least you'll be able to understand what's going on."
4,Works like a champ,This brush is just as good as the costly Sonic ones. Everytime I use this brush I feel very clean and Oral B has really made a good product. This little champ can even get into the tough spots. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good power toothbrush at a very reasonable price.
4,Holds a charge,Hard to comment on a toothbrush except to say this one really holds a charge well. Traveled for over 2 weeks without recharging.
1,Dont get this!,I would have taken it back but amazon doesnt take items back from health & personal care. The vibes are way too strong and making brushing uncomfortable and annoying. I've had wayyyyyy better electronic brushes at the dollar store or rite aid for $3 rather than this one. Dont waste your money! They give coupons for this crap in the paper as well.
2,a bit sluggish,"I've used an Oral B electric toothbrush for 5 or 6 years now and decided it was time for a new one when I dropped it in a very unfortunate place! When looking for a new one on Amazon I chose the green this time rather than the basic white. It looks great but it just seems a bit sluggish compared to my old one. Also, I enjoyed the two speeds of the older model as well. This one just has one, which again, seems slow."
4,Dual action does a good job,I went from using the previous Oral B with the circular brush only and there is no comparison between that and the dual action brush. Very good upgrade.
5,Great Toothbrush for the price,"I have used my Sonic Care toothbrush for 8 years and cost me $120. So, I got a good deal buying 2 of these oral b brushes for $30 something dollars. Me and my daughter have been using the brushes for a year. I think it is just as good as my very expensive sonic care toothbrush. We use the small round head and it does great. I noticed the new heads for this brush to get down between the teeth and I looked at a display one and it looks cheap and looks like the long rubber pieces that go between your teeth would rip off easily. Really flimsy. I will stay with the small round head. Cleans our teeth great! We will be sticking with this reasonably priced electric toothbrush that works just as good as my old expensive one I bought from my dentist!"
5,"Green brush made in Germany, blue brush made in Mexico","Great brush!I have both, blue and green, and they both work well.If you're deciding between the two colors, remember that the blue one has a single, round, dentist-tool-like head, and the green one has a regular toothbrush type head.The only issues are:- It's a NiCd battery which means it'll have the memory effect- If the battery dies, you have to wait at least 8 hours before you can use it, so either keep it charged all the time, or have a backup brush.(If it matters to you:)For whatever reason, the blue one is made in Mexico and the green one is made in Germany.The heads are all made in Germany."
5,Perfect Christmas gift in spite of the cord!,I know that it's considered un-cool to give your wife a gift that has a power cord. But my wife loves this electric toothbrush.(I feel the same about the one Santa brought me.) They work much better than a manual one (of course) and give that squeaky-clean feeling of just leaving the dentist's office. The two minute timer helps to remind to brush thoroughly. I also bought the 3-pack of head refills. Excellent price on all three items and free shipping!
4,Works great!,The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is the fact that in the stores the toothbrush comes with an extra brush. When on sale the cost is about $25. So the savings isn't as good as I originally thought. Performance is great and delivery was quick. So I am not really disappointed.
3,"Fair design, good qulaity","I've had this product for a while now and just getting to the review.It is solid construction and works as described. The actual design and bristle movement is not as good as the ultrasonic brush I previously had. But, this is an inexpensive replacement. I used this brush for 2 years and got a clean report from my dentist!Use with baking soda once a week!"
4,high quality low price,"does the job, reaches between the teeth, polishsOral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush"
3,Now how does this work?,"I suppose if I carefully read the manual that comes with the product, I can figure out how to put it in my mouth so that the two separate heads do what they are supposed to do. In the meantime . . . I do whatever . . .Maybe some day I will figure out the correct brush position. I have to concur with another reviewer that the head(s) are rather large and using this toothbrush in a small mouth (as mine is) takes some getting used to--and I am accustomed to it after a few weeks of use. I do not like it as well as my Vitality Sonic but my hygienist says the newer models are better. The verdict will be decided, I suppose, with my next visit for my cleaning."
3,Short Battery Life,"Can't beat the price, or the slim look and feel but some of the cost savings may have come from a smaller battery. The charge only lasts for 3-4 days, twice a day brushing for the full two minutes, about half that of my costlier Sonic. Since my charger is somewhat inconveniently located (due to small bathroom) this is an issue for me. The oversize brush head is intriguing!"
5,Great Gift,This was a gift for my husband and he was very happy with it. I would consider buying one for myself but there is only room on the counter for one.
4,Just what I was looking for,"I bought this power toothbrush mainly because of its price, less that $20. It's the first power toothbrush that I've had since I was a kid, now 30 something. Basic in operation and cleaning the 2 minute timer is also a nice feature."
2,Almost but no cigar,it appears this brush is another one even Oral B cannot explain why the charge does not hold as long it claims one does But on the upside.keep using and charging it it may eventually perform as expected.same holds true of their Precision.would suggest not buying the replacement heads first as was done until you find something the DOES work as expected.
1,This is the worst thing I bought in Amazon,"It doesn;t work the very first time I used it. The thing doesn't charge, after I brushed just one time and it's ridiculous.I'm too busy right now to return this thing. And it seems like the product was not even new. There were a lot of wear and tear of the product, and I think they are using the old ones and just putting it inside the new box. I just wanna sue this company."
1,Violence in my mouth,"I have had a sonic elite electric toothbrush for years that works well, except that the last (very expensive) replacement head I bought was giving me trouble. After reading the positive reviews on this much less expensive brush, I thought I would try it. I barely lasted through one toothbrushing session. The action of the brush is so aggressive, my jaw was shaking wildly. I felt like I was in a torture machine. I am used to using an electric toothbrush so it wasn't the adjustment from manual to electric. This is just a wild machine. I won't use it and haven't a clue what to do with it now. After using the Oral-B once, I can see that the investment in the sonic is worth the money. In a word: ugh."
1,Sent two extra orders,This order was not made by me or Amazon but I notified them within 10 minutes after receiving conformation but they still sent 2 orders I did not make!
4,The toothbrush,My dentist said I needed a power toothbrush and tried to sell me one for $190.00. I went online and read all the reviews and felt this toothbrush would be as good as the other expensive one. They were both Oral B's. This toothbrush leaves my teeth feel as clean as if the dental hygienist had cleansed my teeth. The timer is very helpful. I would recommend this product to anyone.
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this book, there was more recipes ""NOT"" worth keeping or trying, than ones that were.Definately NOT worth the cost of this cookbook. Save your money and buy a different cookbook."
5,Excellent overview of how the sun works,"This is a well written, easy to follow, and often humorous book on a subject that many people have little knowledge of. The study of the sun is fascinating - sunspot generation, solar flares, coronal mass ejections (which can be dangerous to us), convection currents and waves... This book explains all of these issues and more with an easy to understand, non-mathamatical approach."
5,my neighborhood,"compelling memoir, all the more so because I live a few blocks from where Smith grew up. I started the book last night, spent the morning reading, finished it this afternoon and then drove up and down the streets where it all took place. a bleak rainy day today; a lot of ghosts."
5,Girls of Tender Age: A Memoir,"This book was very easy reading. The writer holds your interest at all times so that you are enticed to keep reading, reluctant to put the book down. Her subject although sad & tragic at times was never morbid. Her humor was delightful, I laughed out loud several times. I am eager now to read other books by her.She describes the time of her youth to a 'T'."
2,The memoir part? Interesting. The murder? Not so much.,"I enjoy reading memoirs- idk why, I just do. So, at the first chance I read Girls of Tender Age. The first half of the book was a memoir of Tirone-Smith's childhood in a silent house- her older brother, Tyler,was autistic and could not stand noise of any kind- laughing, crying, and dog barking, to name a few. If Tyler heard such noises, he would knaw at his arm. We also are told of Tirone-Smith's family history, which is quite interesting, as well as a background of a killer. The second half consists of Tirone-Smith's attempt to recall, make sense of, and write about a murder that occured when Tirone-Smith was 10. Her classmate, Irene, was strangled to death with her own scarf. Despite what the bookcover says, Irene is not Tirone-Smith's neighbor or even friend. She was only a quiet classmate, and the book falls apart after her murder. I was disapointed, because up to that point I had been throughly enjoying it. It became quite uncomprehensible."
3,good book; two interesting errors of fact,"An interesting book, easy read. I was surprised at two errors, one easy to check, the other not. First the name for a French grandfather is not 'pipierre'; it is 'pepere', with accent aigu on first e and accent grave on the second.The one that shouldn't have gotten by the editors is saying that Ann Blyth starred with Howard Keel in Showboat. Not so, it was Kathryn Grayson."
3,slow starter,"I enjoyed the book towards the end, but I had difficulty getting into it and nearly put it down several times before the pace finally picked up."
2,eBook quality is very poor,"I bought this as a kindle version for my iPad. The book was well written, but the poor quality of the formatting was distracting. Photos were linked incorrectly. Word spacing after italic words disappeared. Is this a sacrifice we have to make for the convenience of reading on an eReader?"
5,good read,"just finished this book. i liked it very much. it was touching, funny, sad, tragic and a lot more. Well written. would recommend it."
4,Very interesting,I had a hard time putting this book down. I was sorry when the book ended. Mary-Ann developed all the people in her book very well that you felt by reading it they were part of your own family..and if not family member someone that that you knew a lot about. I thought this book was very good on many levels. Thank you for writing such a powerful memoir. Barb :)
4,This is an excellent book,"The Dalai Lama is one of the wisest and most successful people on this Earth. Any of his books is worth buying. This one is particularly useful, because it is a mix of several different, more specific writings. Its daily format is very helpful. Buy it and read, keep it and read it again."
3,Interesting - yet not really exciting,Here's a small fifty-page book. I enjoyed getting a copy as I've personally hiked the mountain over 500 times. I can't imagine anybody unfamiliar with the area finding much interest in this book. Nevertheless the book contains excellent information for those interested. The history of the mountain is well represented. Including the controversial name and how it came about. Photos from the past show glimpses of the pre-city era. Basic maps of the hiking trails are included. I've enjoyed this book but it's hard to recommend unless you have hiked the area.
3,Better than the alternative,"Delivered quickly by vendor. The art of using the product takes some practice but it does the job as intended. The lower rating is given to the difficulty getting the wet wipes inserted properly into the head of the device. The ""grabber"" portion lacks the tension to securely fasten the wipe for a firm wiping of one's backside. Hopefully with additional use of weeks to come, I will master the instertion of the wipe into the groves. Five stars to the renewed independence it provides me for personal bathroom functions."
1,not worth the money,"We did not even try this product because when we first put tissue/wipes in the ""fingers"" of the bottom buddy they would not release, no matter how hard you pushed the button. Wish I had my money back, but for understandable reasons it is ""nonreturnable""."
5,gift for dad with shoulder surgery,"I bought this as a gift for my dad when he had shoulder surgery and couldn't reach his arm around backward. He said it worked great, and his recovery is going faster than expected, he's already ""off"" the buddy. He says it's kind of pricey but he was very grateful. He's going to keep it around just in case."
3,Not MY Buddy,"I recently purchased this product along with the ""Self Wipe Toilet Aid by Self Wipe"" and I must tell you, despite its whimsical name, Bottom Buddy is NO buddy to bottoms. If you like toilet paper things like this, I urge to try a different brand."
1,"Never helped me, and non-refundable","I feel like a sucker, and it's partly my fault. First, it isn't long enough. 12""+ would have helped. Totally useless. And no refunds, regardless whether it was used or not. I am in no financial position to take a $40 hit. Let the buyer beware."
1,Poor Product,"This is a poor product for the reason that inserting paper into the device is very difficult. Even after doing so, it doesn't hold the wad very well for a hard, pressing wipe.Even if it did work, it is overpriced! As another reviewer said, I just flushed $40!"
1,no buddy knows,the poroduct does not work. bought it to use after shoulder surgery. i should have saved my money. never used it.
5,PERFORMS......,"Exactly as advertised, with new engineering, the handle is now sturdy and well constructed....best for wipes, but can be used with toilet tissue"
3,help for handicapped,For a person with limited shoulder and back mobility this item is useful. The only downside for my husband is that he isn't able to insert his usual amount of toilet paper.
2,Bottom Buddy,The head of the Bottom Buddy wand is too large and it neither holds nor releases the toilet tissue well.
4,The Short and Long of It,"I have two at home. The handle is hard plastic with a sliding switch that opens the blue rubber toilet grabber attached to the end of the stick. I use five toilet paper sheets folded at the crease for each wipe and have to stuff the paper into all three slots without ripping it. Sometimes the paper tears, and I have to start again with fresh paper. Using less paper than five usually results in the tolet paper breaking which exposes the blue rubber to the skin - I think it cleans better than the 'ol left hand and toilet sheet combo and uses less paper doing it. The design is for persons with trouble turning or bending. I suppose it could also be good for a Home Health Aid to use when wiping her client after they had a bowel movement. However, some I am sure would not want this device used because they prefer the personal touch with baby wipes. I suggest you buy one for an obese family member or aged parent. It makes a thoughtful and useful gift."
2,not bad...could be better,This item is way to short in the handle. It is not too hard to clean and does a decent job...could be better.
3,I'd Change a Couple Things on This One,I'd lengthen the handleI'd angle it differently for easier useI'd LOWER the priceThere's a definate learning curve to this item. I usually use a different type when necessary but I like this one for gripping Wet Wipes.
3,Breaks at the same place even when using baby wipes,"i WORKS WELL BUT THE DARN THING BREAKS AT THE SAME PLACE ALL THE TIME. I ALWAYS USE BABY WIPES, THEY NEED TO MAKE IT STRONGER"
2,Skip it,I was disappointed with this product. I found the handle to be too short and heavily weighted at the end. If you have weak hands then I suggest you skip this one. Attaching paper to the end is not easy. And releasing the paper is awkward.I ended up throwing this product away.
1,Overpriced and does not work,"The Bottom Buddy seems sturdy enough and is theoretically a good design. However, it does not work. If the paper is inserted in a way that lets it be ejected, it falls out in use. If it is inserted deeply enough not to fall out, it cannot be ejected. I tried both toilet paper and wipes without success. In my opinion, I have just flushed $40."
3,Didn't work for me,"I bought the bottom buddy because I broke both my hands/wrist. I have use of my fingers on one hand and thought the buddy would help reduce the possibility of a mess. Wrong. Because I can't bend my wrists it is nearly impossible to get the tissue off the buddy and into the toilet. If wiping is difficult because of a hip or back injury or because of weight this product maybe more useful, but if your hands don't work well the bottom buddy is a pain in the butt."
3,must have been bad shipping......,"We like the product... the only problem I think was the shipping... this product has two plastic end caps that hold the center stick so it stays on the cutter roller.... both were busted... so bad that we could not put it on the cutter... we have to unrole the paper by hand and cut it with scissors. its a real pain but, its what has to be done..."
2,not enough variety (P-K version)... ones for older kids are good though,"My daughter (5 1/2) typically loves workbooks. But, this one (P-K edition) was too much of the same thing over and over. There is definitely not enough variety. The counting pages were not at all interesting or challenging for her. I have found other workbooks for this age group hold her attention without issue. This one does not."
4,"Economics solid, Timing off","While Mr. Burkett's timing for the economic collapse is off the principals remain solid. Our economy will collapse and his book fortells how and why, while still offering hope. Much thought to chew on."
2,They run small and are very stiff,"These shoes run small, so make sure you order at least a half size larger than you would normally wear. I didn't like them at all. The material is very hard, very stiff. It never gets better, and I wore them through 3 seasons of bowling leagues before finally purchasing a different brand. I much prefer the type of bowling shoe that is just like a tennis shoe. A pair that looks and feels just like your favorite pair of sneakers, but with the bowling-shoe sole added on."
4,Great program,"I have to say the other reviewers are correct about this plan and its amazing results. One thing I noticed in other reviews is that they really don't mention how hard you have to work at this program. Of course changing your body in a healthy way SHOULD take a lot of hard work. The virtual elimination of refined carbs is very difficult for a lot of people's lifestyles and eating habits. I decided to work on that BEFORE starting the program and ended up losing 15 lbs. and considerable body fat with my regular workout routine. Three weeks into the program I was already at a point I never thought my body would achieve. Before reading this book, I was in a constant cycle of overtraining and then nursing injuries. This program taught me to moderate and to strengthen my weak areas. This program really works if YOU are willing to work."
5,Just what my body needed,"I am a fitness freak and a fitness and dance instructor. I am always looking for a new way to challenge my body and take it to new extremes. This book really gave me an understanding of what I need to do to take my body and its strength to the next level. It is comprehensive and easy to understand. I reccommend this book to all my friends and anyone who is looking for a good fitness trainer but don't have the money for a live one, whether you are just starting out or you are stuck in a rut. He has developed workouts that fit your body type too, which makes it even more of an ideal workout because you can zone in on slimmming your trouble spots."
3,I want the box!,"Why you send me only separated small packs? I want the box in the picture which you show on site!,!"
3,MCSE Training Guide,"All in all, the book supplies the reader with enough information in order to grasp major / detailed concepts in order to pass the tests. I found several topics discussed in great detail which were only briefly touched upon in other references. On the other hand, I find a lot of unnecessary repetition of information. I also find some of the topics to be TOO incredibly detailed, a least for a book of this nature. In essence, if you have a firm grasp of NT and general networking concepts, this book will help you grasp the material to pass the test. If you're more of a beginner, this definitely is not a text for you."
4,Good Self-Study Material,"This is good material for those trying to LEARN the software (not just pass the test) and who have chosen self-study over classroom training. The material is relevant although some material is not likely to be seen on an exam (once again, good for those who wish to learn, not just test). There were a few errors on the CD-ROM based practice tests. The Networking Essentials practice test was particularly bad."
4,Getting to the Heart of Leadership,"Phillip Greenslade cuts to the heart issue of what great leadership is all about--serving others.There are dozens of books on Christian leadership. Many of them are just a repackaging of popular secular works on the subject.While other writers have adapted ""secular"" ideas to Christian leadership, Greeenslade has built on the satement of Jesus, ""If you want to be great in the Kingdom of God, learn to be the servant of all.""There is certainly room for ""how to"" and ""technical"" approaches to leadership in the church. However, learning to serve must be the top priority in any leadership program.Although the organization of the book could have been better, the essential material for this subject is exhausted.If you are looking for an easy read to pass to emerging leaders, this is the perfect book."
4,"would have been 5 stars, but...","I would have given this product 5 stars except that it came with Dreamweaver 3 instead of 4, but no where in the advertising does it tell that part. With it being Ultr Dev 4 one just assumes that Dreamweaver will be 4 also. Then one is offered to ""upgrade"" to Dreamweaver 4 for only another $199, I felt a little ripped off. But I do find the software easy to use."
3,WAY TOO EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game for Christmas last year. I was very excited to get the game, but in about three hours, I not only managed to pass the game, but unlock every minigame, get 999 stars, and get 999 lives! I went again to play it on hard mode and I still passed the game along with all the bonuses! I play the game every once in a while because it's fun, but I suggest you try to find it in the bargain bin and not pay full price."
1,Short!,"the game started out fun but it was really short! It only took maybe 2 hrs to complete it, and if i pay good money, then it should be worth it but it isn't!NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE WASTE OF TIME!"
5,the best,this is the best game i ever played. i got it for christmas and my eyes are always glued to the screen
5,Seek and You Will Find,"I propped this book up on the bookrack on my new treadmill. I opened it up being careful not to break the spine. I love the way a new book feels. I love the way I feel - excited about the treasure hidden between the covers.And what a treasure it was. WANDA GUTIERREZ included an entire book's worth of information in the first chapter. My thirty-minute workout passed by before I knew it.I savored every spiritual morsel in this book. The succeeding chapters held as much nourishment as the first. After reading this book, you will be a more mature Christian - one who knows the Source of Peace, and your search will be over."
5,EXCELLENT,"Every song on this CD is nice, but DEMENTED FOREVER is my favorite song on this CD. WHAT A VOICE! I hit the repeat button over and over again. THIS song is a must-hear. Get this CD, it's nice, and Thank you to the artist KAREN MCMILLAN FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND LET US HEAR FROM YOU REAL SOON!"
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent change of pace. I'm not into whether something is hip-hop, rock-n-roll, rap or anything like that. I just like music and anything that sounds good to me. This CD does that for me. I really like the Demented Forever track. I JUST bought the CD so I haven't had time to listen to each and every song. I reached Demented Forever and then I got stuck. I promise I'll finish though.Get this CD...it's really, really nice - unless, of course you like the same old thing. I don't. I really can't explain WHY this CD is so nice...It just is. I'm just waiting to see the movie now.----Darke----"
3,Kara K......SOUNDS GREAT!!!,I have to say that I was quite impressed with this young ladies style and power. This is the sort of stuff we would love to add at our radio stations! I'm interested in hearing more.Capt Kole P Air Personality Detroit MI
5,Best Buy - Best Coffee,This machine makes the best cup of coffee. We had a Krupts coffee maker but it started to leak. This Hamilton Beach 43421 can hold it's own with the best or more expensive coffee makers.
2,"Great features, good price. It didn't last.","I bought this item based on some of the reviews here, and I've had it about a year. I've was very pleased with the features and the price, but yesterday it died. It now stays on whenever it's plugged in. The on/off button doesn't affect this at all. Plug it in and the base gets hot and it wants to brew coffee. I am disappointed."
3,Good for a year,"For a simple coffee maker, it was a pretty good deal. The coffee was good. The unit was very easy to use and program. Unfortunately, after a year, the unit stopped working. The clock and control buttons work fine, but the warmer doesn't heat up anymore and the water won't drain through the grounds. If you'd be happy with a year of good coffee for $40, this unit is for you. If you expect it to last a little longer than that, you might want to try another model."
1,Ugh,"The coffee that this machine makes is fine, but the machine itself was a real disaster. I have only had this coffee maker for about 5 months and 2 pieces have broken -- the lid to the carafe and a trigger piece behind the carafe. Also, the carafe never sits flat on the burner, which drives me nuts.I really can't wait to buy a new coffee maker, but it's hard to judge by the reviews I read on this site. Everyone else seemed to love this coffee machine! I can't really imagine why though, because the coffee isn't special enough to make up for all the other faults of this machine."
5,An Excellent Coffee Maker,"I'm not a huge coffee lover but I wanted a machine that would brew great coffee for guests. At the same time, I didn't want an eyesore in the kitchen. The Hamilton Beach is a great machine on both counts and comes at an extremely reasonable price.The pre-wet cycle ensures full flavor and the machine has other useful features such as a timer to start brewing whenever you like and an automatic shut-off after 2 hours. For those who prefer gold filters to paper, the standard cone shaped gold filter will fit perfectly.This is a very good coffeemaker at a bargain price. It's also looks attractive without being overly aggressive in style like some espresso machines. Do yourself a favor and buy one soon."
5,Great coffee..finally,"I agree with everyone else's opinion on this pot. I even prefer this coffee to my Chemex. The prewet cycle is great, but I find that when the coffee goes thru it it doesn't come out as hot as I'd like. So what I do is click on the flavor button for a few minutes to wet the grounds, then when the coffee starts dripping into the pot I click it again to turn off the slower brewing and let the coffee come thru in the regular fashion. Still gets the advantage of the grounds soaking and is hot. My Braun will be going to Goodwill shortly."
3,HARRISON vs BUKOWSKI,"Harrison's collection of essays attempt to bend Bukowski and his work over to a leftist perspective. Looking a little closely at Bukowski, his writings (poetry, prose, stories) tend to shift in an apolitical pattern. There is no leftist consistency with his work, though I'll give three stars for Harrison's effort and my own leftist sympathies.-- Brad Evans --"
1,Sorry...Buk was NOT a lefty!,"Despite the efforts of liberals,and the leftto claim bukowski as thier own,the simple fact is..he wasnt.Buk was apolitical.In FACT,he made several comment's onhow the left was so consumed with thierown self importance,they *lose* credibility.You want proof?Of course you do.Read ""The captain is out to lunch....'It's right there in plain buk english.That of course doesn't mean buk didn'tunderstand the poor,and the suffering,because he was one of them.It just means he was aware of the elite left's abilityto pimp these kind of issues for thier own agendas.If you read his books,you will see his opinion varied from issue to issue.The ""author"" of this ""book"",is out to lunch,buk would have vomited on it,and wasted no time in throwing her confused carcass out the door.I'm sure if she really knew bukowski as well as she claims,she is already aware of it...and probably loves the thought!"
3,Bizz Circuits - Very Best Of,"The inside cover of THE VERY BEST OF BIZZ CIRCUITS boasts a humongous list of musical artists -- although you have to wonder how many of them truly influenced this collection. Certainly, the minimalists and the microtonal experimentalists show their hand here (listen to the cool bleeps and dub beats on ""Gilles Deleuze Meets Rockers Downtown"" or the slow, skittering percussion on ""Fantasias Animadas""), but Camper van Beethoven? Don't think so. Sure, ""Blinded with Science (Snowblind)"" has an unmistakable kiss of funk in the bassline, and ""Can't Get No Satisfaction (Thank God)"" certainly pays a debt to Pole, but the Happy Mondays -- not so much. So perhaps it's better to see the list as a grounding for a well-rounded musical education, and the album itself as a subterreanean exploration of bleeps and bass, no matter where the inspiration comes from."
4,Multisystemic Treatment of Antisocial Behavior,Informative and educational and will certianly help me with my job.
3,Annoying sound score,"The documentary is, as expected, informative. However, it is overshadowed by the totally unfit and very intrusive Sound score, consisting entirely of fast-paced action-scene, militaristic music, mixed in way too loudly. Think of the music during an action scene from an Indiana Jones movie, and stick this score on a calmly narrated documentary - it does not work at ALL. Even after watching all DVD's, this was quite annoying still."
1,Secrets of WWII disc set.,"I purposely looked at the description details to make sure this was close captioned as I was going to give it to my 91 year old father for Christmas.He is hard of hearing and CC was extremely important.I saw nothing related to this issue in the reviews.Imagine my disappointment when I looked all over the case, only to find in tiny print ""no subtitles""!Your description of Close Captioned really mis led me.I am sending this back.."
4,WW 2 Intelligence,Only buy this if you are a WW2 nut - which I am. There is a lot of good stuff in these and a lot of duplication. The World at War series is far far better. But if you can't get enough of WW2 and particularly the intelligence side you will be pleased with this set.
3,This product's description is NOT accurate.,"Amazon, and subsequently, the Marketplace sellers who offer it, need to change the way this item is listed.There are no explicit lyrics on this UK import. These are the same edited versions of the songs that are found on the US version of the CD. So if you are expecting the unedited versions of the songs that are found in the film (as I was), you won't find them here.I will not completely trash this review; I do love this soundtrack (hence the three stars, rather than one or two). I must admit, though, I am disappointed. I was expecting this version to deliver the same 'full-flavor' that was given to us in the film."
3,This Is the EDITED Version,"This is NOT the explicit or Parental Advisory version of the soundtrack. This description is inaccurate and should be corrected. While the songs are great, the edited version contains too many ""hiccups"" in order to edit out profanities and that interrupts the flow of the songs."
5,Great,"I thought this was an awesome movie, the fight scenes were great, and the storyline was good as well. A good soundtrack for a good movie. My personal favorite track is ""Confidential - It really don't matter"". I especially like the beats and the instrumentals to it."
4,good cd 4 hip-hop,"This is a very good CD that ties in with the movie, and features music from actors in the movie."
2,Sponge bob,If your getting this for a younger child don't. I played it first to see if it was something grandson could do and even I was bored early on.
5,The Road to Success is a success,"This book takes a light, whimsical view of now famous personas who were once great failures. Joey Green has a knack for finding all kinds of little known facts and bringing them to life as he has done many times before with his ""Off-beat Uses"" book series. This book has recently made a great, fun gift for a few friends who have found themselves unemployed."
5,A great pick-me-up!,"This book is a great pick-me-up when one feels as if the goals set are just out of reach. The icons we all know and recognize are included - failures and success on each page. Who knew Frank Sinatra was expelled from high school for rowdy behavior?!This is a great gift book, and I would recommend it for people starting any new adventure: college, a new job, or for the fun of the read."
2,Failure,"I wanted a quick reading way for my school children to see how people became successful. I thought this book would be a valuable reference. I immediately opened it upon its arrival and haven picked it up since then. The stories are too short and do not have enough meat to them to be of service to me. I was looking for a rich, detail resource not a shallow, short lived blurb."
3,Read Me First!!,"Please look at all of the reviews that gave"" five stars"" . They had almost the same lenght and the same writing style. The reviews have been written from JUNE 27, JUNE 28, JUNE 29, JUNE 30 and JULY 1. Interesting!"
1,Only for those who already know some Swahili,"If you already know basic Swahili, this product might help you expand your vocabulary. Otherwise I would not recommend buying this four CD set even though the price is low. Three of the CDs offer only seemingly random and disorganized words and 1 CD offers similarly disorganized short phrases. (To illustrate how randomly chosen they are, I'll just give you the first 4 so-called expressions: ""My pleasure,"" It's over,"" ""Why not?"" and ""It's about time."") A first time visitor needs the basics - greetings, numbers, polite phrases - and this product doesn't offer those necessities, at least in any way that's easily accessible. Words and phrases are spoken in English and then repeated once in Swahili; later on the same CD Swahili comes first and the English second, but the words are not in the same order. The whole thing's a mishmash."
2,Only if you're interrested in some music tech history.,"This documentry can be a bit boring, but it is fascinating to hear first hand about the developement of the electronic synthesizer from its creator and associates."
2,"Thin on context, rambling, Tedious.","The best part of the film is the animated intro and title sequence done in an early 70's style. If only the film could've carried on some of that creativity and interest. Sadly, it's a bit of a waste of hours of interviews with Mr. Moog.To be short, it's dreary and tedious. Partly because there's no organizing direction and we're left with interviews jumbled together. I kept waiting for the film to start because it felt like clips spliced together. One wonders if the interviewer ever followed up on a question he asked.As soon as the film starts with the interview with Mr. Moog - no setup, context - that's what you're in for the whole way.It's really for hard core Moogiacs or if you want to get a glimpse into the man. Overall, very disappointed. How it can earn 4 or 5 stars is beyond me unless the scale goes to 10."
2,"mumbling, muttering mess","A documentary about Robert Moog, one of the most important figures in electronic music? Yes, please, sign me up. Alas, this premise goes awry from the outset. This mishmash of a documentary feels like a collection of outtakes from a better work. I don't need to see Robert Moog talking about pepper plants and Money Mark diddling around on a synthesizer.MOOG demonstrates that sometimes it's best to not rely on the subject of the documentary as the subject matter expert of the film. Robert Moog is not the most well-spoken advocate and historian of his life's work. Likewise, showing the electronic guts of his machines doesn't do much to explain how they work or why Moog's work is important to the music world.When utilizing archive footage, MOOG works. Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between leaving MOOG a mumbling, muttering mess for its interminable seventy-two minutes. Moog and electronica deserve better."
1,This Giant Deserves Better,"This wonderful pioneer of electronic music deserves to be praised and studied. This documentary does neither - it consists of long, tedious diatribes by people like Rick Wakeman. That's about it.And how can you offer a documentary about Moog without mentioning Wendy Carlos, much less interviewing her?Don't bother with this one."
2,where's wendy/walter?,"Finally having seen this, I'm troubled and shocked by the fact that there is no mention whatsoever to Wendy,or Walter,for that matter,Carlos in this program.In fact Robert Moog starts the film by saying that 'Switched on Bach' started it all,that it was the sole cultural artifact that introduced synthesis,and sinthesizers to the mass audience,and general conciousness,but he was either been shamefully edited or samelly omitted 'Switched on Bachs' creator,and mastermind ,sinthesis pioneer Wendy Carlos,by then going by the name of Walter,and obviously of another gender as well.Whatever caused this,and appart from unwillingness of Wendy's part to colaborate,one can fairly assume the worse,only descredited the works as at least historically incorrect,and frankly,perilously bordering on revisionism.You get Rakeman instead.I pass.P.S:R.I.P Bob Moog."
4,Great book for beginners,"This guide book is a great book for beginners or young children. The format of the book makes it easy to look up a shell you've discovered. While there are many high quality photographs in this book I am only rating it 4 stars because I found some of the photographs to be of lesser quality, thus making the identification between specific species within a shell category a little more difficult.This book is probably not for the avid collector.The values given to each shell may or may not be completely accurate, but they are fun to see."
1,Stay away! Don't buy this book!,I don't know why I bought this book. Its my fault I didn't even bother to read the reviews. The book is one long sales pitch. There are several books out there about mail order that's worth your moeny.
5,"Understated, Overlooked, Beautiful","I've owned this CD for years, and every time I come across it in my collection and plunk it in the player it's like rediscovering a long lost friend. Dana's guitar playing is rythmic, polished, and understated. The songs are sort of ""modern traditional""--they sound like they've withstood the test of time and are a part of our folklore, though they are all from Dana's creation. Dana gives these songs life with a wonderfully raspy voice that provides a kind of intimacy to the delivery. Over the years this has become one of my favorite CDs. I've never understood why Dana Robinson isn't more of a household word--this CD is an overlooked gem."
5,works well and fast,I received a sample of these Advil Liquid-gel and loved them so much that I bought the 160-count box. They are fast-acting and works like wonder.
5,HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE,"WELL PLEASED , MY COACH RECOMMENDED THIS FOR MY JOINTS AFTER A HARD WORK OUT,I TAKE 2 EACH NIGHT , HELPS ME TO SLEEP, WAKE UP RESTED. WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR."
3,Expiration date,"The only problem I found with this product is that will in expire in 4 month, so I will need to drink it or give it up."
5,These Boys Know What's Goin' On!,"PAS/CAL is amazing, simply and beautifully joyous to the ears. I go to all their concerts that I am physically able to, which limits me to the Detroit area, their and my hometown. As for the EP, it's beautiful. At their latest show at a record store in Dearborn, lead singer and guitarist Casimer Pascal explained their technique for naming albums. The first EP, called 'The Handbag Memoirs' does not have the song ""The Hadbag Memoirs"" on it. That's on the next EP...'Oh Honey, We're Ridiculous' which (surprise surprise) doesn't have the song titled ""Oh hony, We're Ridiculous."" That's on the next one. The explaination? ""Because we're clever like that!""This album is wonderful. So are they. If you catch them at a show, bassist Nathaniel Burgundy will give you a felt heart to show your love for the band:Lead Vocals/Guitar: Casimer PascalLead Guitar: Gene CorduroyBass:Nathaniel BurgundyGuitar: Trevor MottDrums: LTD (Little Tommy Daniels)Keyboards: Richard Panic"
3,a fine taster...,"Pas/Cal's debut ep is a fine taste of things to come, naturally leaving you wanting more. It's not exactly the most original record, on first listen you begin chucking ""-esque"" comparisons to three seminal bands starting with the letter B: Beach Boys, Beatles, Belle & Sebastian. Of course, the question is whether band can rise above their peers, which on ""Handbag Memoirs"", they don't quite, not yet at least. But what you get here is enjoyable and appealing, not earth-shattering, with at least one gloriously perfect pop song in ""The Bronze Beached Boys""."
1,"pretentious, fey boringness","have you ever seen these guys live? oh dear god, so awfully boring. casimer pascal needs to get over himself."
4,for the lazy ones,"This works well on my ProBook 4510s using XP to which I stuck a little 2.5 inch cable to it and doesn't take up any extra space in the carry bag. Only thing to me that is an issue would be it moves around a bit and could be a bit heavier, costing this review 1 star, but after saying that I do like being able to use different cables with the mini plug.As for the lazy part, not having to type in passwords, yea, bit lazy, but what the hey."
2,Only for under-3-year olds,"""Snuggle Wuggle"" was part of our ""Read aloud"" program for little kids in Denver public schools. I read it to a classroom of bright 4 & 5 year olds.The illustrations are very nice, but the rhymes are like baby-talk.""How does a bear hug? Snuggle-wuggle. Snuggle-wuggle.""""How does a deer hug? Fluffy duffy. Fluffy duffy.""This just didn't work for kids old enough to describe their halloween costumes to you. What's ""wuggle""? -Is ""fluffy duffy?"" the sound of a hug? Seems it should be an adverb, but...I think most kids over four are delighted by Dr. Seuss' rhyming nonsense words and they get it when a ""vorpal blade"" goes ""snicker snack"", but the rhymes in this book seem geared for toddlers of pre-speech age.For kids over the age of two, don't bother with this one."
3,Good for the money,I am happy overall however I periodically get static when both microphones are in use or sometime even with just using 1 microphone.
3,"Hisonic VHF Dual Rechargeable Wireless Microphone System, HS8286.",We puurchased these microphones due to issues with ones we had. Unfortunatly these are doing the same thing. They keep cutting out while in use.
2,Very poor pickup of speaker,"These are nicely designed and have great range, the only issue is that the speaker has to basically eat the microphone for it to pick them up and that is with the setting up full blast. Outside that they are great. Nice they recharge on the dock, bright displays and the mics have good heft to them just don't pick up well."
2,Good until it stopped working,"This lasted a little over a year, and while it worked it worked well, especially considering the savings on batteries. However, now the sound will sometimes work if I pound on the base, but not for long. Next time I'll spend a little more and get a better system."
3,decent mic for the price,The first thing that everyone needs to realize about these mics is that they are low end mics. That being said you can't expect to much at this low price. The batteries that were included drain fairly quickly in our karaoke system so we replaced them with some higher end batteries. Also the mics will sometimes drop sound when both are used at the same time. I would buy it again since it is a cheap duo set and is fine for a home system.
2,normal,"too bad when you expect one, but you get more. On the site says Operating range: 300 fet, but in the user's guide ""Operating range: 30 Meters (Approximate 100 feet)"" and it is realy. But a very timely and good quality delivery."
3,No es un equipo exactamente para karaoke,"Este es un equipo para reproducir microfono a traves de un amplificador, no opera por sí solo, es un componente que debe ser conectado a otro equipo para reproducir la señal de los microfonos. Ojo, no es el equipo ideal para usarlo como karaoke en el hogar."
1,Only lasted a month!,I've used these mics for a little over a month. one mic doesn't work already and the other one is already muffled sounding and they have been well taken care of. Tried to email Hisonic a few times for a replacement but their inbox is always full. NOT HAPPY! I'll go with Emerson or Nady next time.
2,not charging and no sound,Haven't been able to get it to charge or work so far. Don't know if it nees something we don't have or not. We may have to send it back if we don't get it figured out.
3,do not catch your sound well,"If your are singing to the in alt part, the microphone does not catch your sound, sounds like you are singing without microphone. Feel like it is very basic, not professional at all, and does not worth $99.99. half the price may be okay."
4,"Hisonic VHF Dual Rechargeable Wireless Microphone System, HS8286.",Very good product for the price. I have used it for almost a year and it is still working well. One down side of the product is that one microphone seems not to sensitive as the other.
3,"Works ok, but....","I purchased this unit a couple of days ago. The sound quality seems to be good but the problem I face is that the sound cuts off for a few seconds (1 - 3 seconds) intermittently but frequently from both the microphones. Seems the microphone loses connection with the base unit. The base unit is about 20 feet away. This has been the behavior from day one. I use these for Karaoke sessions and this sudden loss of sound becomes very disruptive to the singer. I thought it was the charge so I have been making sure the charge is full, but it has not helped. I even moved the base unit around. Unfortunately I'm over the 30 day return window with amazon. I may try to contact the manufacturer and see if their warranty can help.For now, I'm using wired microphones and that defeats the purpose of a wireless system."
1,Dissapointed,"I researched this type of product and decided to buy the Hisonic (dual) Wireless microphones and I got a few hours of good sound but after that, it started buzzing like hungry Bee's. Trying to return it has become a part time job. I will never buy from Outlet Plus. Amazon's return policy is the best, however, if you buy from the vendors make sure you know the ""return policy""."
4,Not bad at all.,"This has substance to its body and substance to its receiver. When something is a piece of crap, there is no weight to it at all and this has its solidness. Sound is not bad at all either. I will always use my ""Shure"" when I sing personally but for gigs, this will work fine!"
3,"works, but feels and looks cheap","the subject pretty much summarize it all.my primary complaints are that it feels and looks and maybe cheap, and the microphone is too bulky."
2,Well built but heavy and mounting can be tricky.,"These baskets are well built, but there are two main drawbacks. The first is the weight, which is substantial. The second is that the mounting hardware included doesn't fit very well over racks with thicker tubes. After having these installed and riding around for a day, I'm regretting that I didn't buy ""grocery bag panniers,"" which can easily clip on and off."
4,Inexpensive and practical,"The baskets are exactly as advertised - they fold up neatly when not in use, and are great at holding a larger load when opened. Only complaint has to do with the mounting hardware - none of it would work with my bike rack - had to resort to zip ties. If the mounting hardware had worked, I'd have given it 5 stars.As others have said, they are heavy, but another 4 lbs added to my hybrid really isn't all that significant (to me at least)."
3,Niagara Bike Products,"The baskets came in a timely manner and were as described - although it was not so clear that a rear bike rack was also required to mount them. So a week after the baskets were received, I ordered a rear rack and a mounting hardware kit for the rear rack. Unfortunately, rather than recieving those two ordered items, a front basket was received. This turned out to be a major inconvenience, as I actually ordered these items for my disabled brother-in-law, and had them shipped directly to him. Needless to say, it just seems not at all worth the effort, or my time, to reorder from this vendor on Amazon's website. Online shopping should be convenient - this experience is in the deficit column in that respect. I'll just go to a local bike shop where I can actually put my hands on the items I want to trade my money for."
3,Functional once installed. The clips are hell to install.,The baskets are perfect. They fit one paper shopping bag almost perfectly each.The clips that attach the rack are a complete pain in the ass to install. I had to re-bend them to fit. It's not pretty how the clips look but once it was on there the baskets are awesome and totally functional.
2,Too heavy,It was tricky getting it on the bike. It was in the way when I peddled. It made the bike too heavy to carry in and out of the apartment. I had to remove it and now don't know what to do with it.
3,"Good product, but...","The baskets are pretty solidly built. The issue I had was fitting the brackets onto the rear rack on my bike. The brackets were slightly too small and it took a lot of work to bend them around the frame to get the screw to fit in the bracket. Also, now that the rack is finally installed, I find that the piece that holds the basket closed is very hard to release and clamp."
4,Good for small amounts of groceries,"I got a couple of these for college. The basket will fit one paper grocery bag. They work fairly well, though one is hard to fold/unfold (a little machine oil in the hinges helped). One thing to keep in mind is that they will start to rust where the paint has worn away, especially if you keep the bike outside."
5,Great iron!,(Permanent Press afficionados need not read this review).I purchased this iron a year ago and now will buy one for my Mom. It is lightweight and very capable of giving a good press. It will do linen and 100% cotton with relative ease. The removable plastic tank makes the whole ironing experience that much easier. If you are doing cotton and you use a lot of steam AND spray you can just pop it off and refill and be back in business in no time. Both the aforementioned steam and spray work very well and the retractable cord completes my enjoyment of this great labor saving device.
4,Good but flimsy,"These trays make really cool molds, we use them for ice cubes and they work well except that the silicone material is a bit flimsy, so it can be a challenge getting them into the freezer, and they must be completely flat or they wont work."
1,Not helpful at all,"By the title, one would expect this volume to be a sort history of haiku as it relates to Japanese culture. As I found when i purchased this, it is certainly not. Ninety percent of this book is comprised of essays by the author concerning his faith and devotion to Christian doctrine without mention of haiku at all. The last 10 pages or so are filled with his haiku in English, which are not outstanding. I am baffled by the title, since haiku seemingly has very little to do with Mr Norimoto's life."
4,Good for the price,"As one reviewer noted, there was a sticker stupidly stuck on the actual rolling pin, and not on the outside plastic. That was stupid. However, after washing it with soapy warm water, it was off and I am not traumatized by the experience. It's a great pin for the price, and I would recommend it."
3,Nothing Special,"This is a wooden rolling pin that I saw later at Wal-Mart for a much lower price. However, it was shipped promptly."
2,"Normal Rolling Pin, Abnormally Stupid Packaging","It's hard to screw up a wooden rolling pin, but the guy's at Good Cook figured out how with the packaging. They glued the company logo to a wooden rolling pin. With a rather sticky glue at that. So, enjoy a good 2-3 min of hard scrubbing after you purchase followed by the fear of glue residue all over your food; or just buy another product."
3,Just ok,Bought as a cheap fix for a small baking project the wife was doing. Pressed to hard while rolling and now the handles are lopsided.
5,Great Taste,"Really great taste, not only in Italian cooking, but almost anything. So much easier and more reasonabley priced than opening a jar, and not knowing when you may use it again."
3,Sound problem,"I have a nice surround system set up that is in a dedicated room and I have enough speakers connected for 7.1 With this dvd I get no sound from my subwoofer no matter if I have it on DTS, or dolby 5.1 Does anyone else have that problem or do I have a bad disc."
5,Like fine wine....,"Every DVD release Sammy does gets better and better. He just continues to get better with age...and I like him a heck of a lot better outside of Van Halen. As others have said, this is almost like being there. Crank it up and party with the Red Rocker.Now, how about a reissue of the amazing MTV 1983 concert on DVD!!!"
5,You are now at the show!!,"I've seen Sammy several times. Most were outdoor venues like this. You can easily buy a LIVE CD, But this will give you all the visual aid needed to get the experience of the show. Put on some shorts. Make a pitcher of Margaritas, and turn it up loud. Every time I re-watch this video, it gives me a feeling of being at ""that party"" you always talk about. The Long Road to Cabo DVD is also good as a Documentary of the Sam & Dave Tour. Lots of music and bonus's. The Birthday Bash DVD has a great set list, and is shot at the Cabo Wabo Cantina. If you've ever thought of going to Mexico in October, this is your Travel brochure."
5,Sammy Hagar rocks St. Louis...again!,"When I heard Sammy Hagar was going to release a DVD of this concert, I couldn't wait for the release date. I attended this concert, and the only thing better than this DVD, is being there live. They did cut Michael Anthony doing, ""Running with the Devil"", but that was the only thing different from the actual show. St. Louis is the best place to experience Hagar, the love the fans have for him there, and vice versa, is like none other. If you are a Red Rocker fan, I suggest you pick this up!"
4,kicks it in to overdrive,"What can you say about the red rocker, As long as he is away from the van halen strike out he will continue to blow people away. such a great showman, you feel energized watching him. He just simply kicks but. And this dvd will not fail you. If you don,t own it, and you are a red rocker fan as i am this is a must have."
3,WESTLAKE ENT!!!!!,"The reviews here are put under numerous items. This is for the Westlake Ent. edition which contains only 2 film shorts, and for which there does not seem to be any other reviews. ""A Star Shall Rise"" is from the tv series Family Theater and features Raymond Burr in a story of the Three Wise Men. The film is complete with a couple of splices during dialogue, and has a good amount of background noise. ""A String of Blue Beads"" is an unsold 1953 pilot for an anthology series and is in color. It features Louis Jourdan and Margaret Hamilton. There is one bad splice and may be slightly missing a little footage. Otherwise, the films are quite entertaining."
2,disappointed,This is a very good book (five stars)but the down load is only a few chapters I was expecting the complete novel
2,Code Three (Updated et al),Very disappointed to discover less than one-third of the orginal book was included; the print version was 176 pages long. The Kindle version (87 pages) ends at pg 56 of the original. I checked several other Kindle versions with the same results. It's like watching only the 1st quarter of a football game then turning the TV off
4,Free SF Reader,Future traffic policing is a 24 hour a day live in your vehicle job for these officers. Their banter is very entertaining.3.5 out of 5
4,Electronic Battle Weapon 6,"Improved and cheaper than the Japan Only EP. The remixes of ""Star Guitar"" and ""Come With Us"" are Okay. H.I.A. compliments the remixes, but ""Electronic Battle Weapon 6"" and ""Temptation/Star Guitar""-live from Brixton Academy make the disc. Seeing as how ""Star Guitar"" echoes New Order's influence on the Chems, the brief ""Temptation"" cover is very appropriate.""The Test"" video in the enhanced portion is very psychedelic. However, ""Star Guitar"" is the only quicktime file to date that my computer has had difficulty with. Oh well..."
3,As I watch it go down in flames,"This cd is nothing more than the same songs that drew me to the O.C. mixes back in season 1 and 2, just redone not as well by less than talented artists. Which ironically strongly resembles the shows plot line these days."
5,O.C. Mix 6 review,All the soundtracks from the O.C. are great. A really good variety of music. This cd has great covers of some of the songs that featured throughout the four seasons.
4,Solid mix cd purchase,"All of the songs are pretty good, and Rock Kill's Kid cover of I Turn My Camera On is amazing. Ashtar Command's Into Dust is also very good. These two songs alone warrant a purchase, but with songs like Debaser and Can't It Out Of My Head, it is simply a must for anyone with taste."
4,Large round Kritter Keeper,"Before I start the review I INSIST that for a betta, you need at least a gallon or more minimum. When doing the math for the volume of this tank the height included the stand so instead of 3 gallons I got 1.5. They should make the volume for their aquarium tanks much clearer.However I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the plastic and the size of the tank itself. It's a very tough strong air tight lid that snaps in a very secure fashion. It's built to be very durable and so far my fish is loving it.The only bummer is that the lid doesn't leave space for a heater or filter. You have to snip at the plastic mesh on the top to create a hole for your chords to go through, hence why I removed a star. Otherwise I'm really liking it so far. Unique shape, attractive and well built product."
1,False advertising,""" The small size is an ideal home for Betta Splendens.""No, it's not. At all. Do some research before buying a betta (or any fish) and putting it in this death trap. Use it for water changes, maybe, but not as a permanent home!"
1,Horrible for any fish...,"This is a horrible home for a Betta. They need at least a 2.5gal or if you want small a 1.5 if you plan to change the water every day. You need to do research before purchasing any animal. A Betta would die fairly quickly in this home, especially if the water wasn't changed at least daily. The ammonia would build up and kill the fish. DO NOT BUY. Good for water changes though if you are cleaning the main tank and need somewhere to put your Betta."
1,Not good,"This album is not pleasing to the ears. He's off key and the material is poor. It is not even reminiscent of his fantastic writing and performances he did while with Asleep At The Wheel. I wish I knew what happened. Perhaps it is the production. I hope he tries again. Instead of this one, I recommend Asleep At The Wheel's first few albums, several of which are available as two-fer CD's: Texas Gold/Wheelin' & Dealin', Comin' Right at Ya/Texas Gold, and Collison Course/The Wheel. And get their self-titled 1974 Epic album (CD: EK33097 or Vinyl: PE33097), which is their best album of all time. It's out of print. If you can find it used, you can expect to pay about $."
3,"Cool idea, but hard to use","The Swissbeat is a clever idea, combining a few useful tools with data storage and MP3 capability. The ability to separate the player from the tool holder is great for travel. However, the menus and single-button control are frustrating to say the least, especially for programming the FM radio. The FM is mono only, I've never been able to receive in stereo, even when signal strength is optimum."
3,Requires good eyesight,"I can't comment on the performance of this item, as I've never used it. I plugged it into my USB2 port to charge it, and, when I looked at the display, I found that I - with my less-than-20-20-vision - couldn't read it.I suppose it should have occurred to me that something which fits inside a pocket knife might have a rather small display, but I was carried away by the coolness of the toy.Just something to consider."
5,The best book ever!,"I am only 13 and lately I have been interested in the Holocaust. Although i am catholic reading this book gave me a total diffrent look to the Holocaust. I read this book in only 3 days. This was so because just the details about the book made me think over how lucky they are to be here today. I finished the book today and thought to my self wow, i can't believe people would be treated in such a harsh way. I was so relieved when i read the ending with such intensity and could not be more happy for Bezo. If you are interested in the Holocaust then i suggest for you to read the book because it is awesome."
2,Not what I expected,This book was just one long story about how she raised her first child. It was pretty sad how she was justifying her child's inability to sit still and be in all these special schools she was putting him in. I did not feel it is going to help me navagate the road of new motherhood unless I am looking for excuses as to why my child cannot play well with others or sit in a classroom. I expected this book to be more than just a one woman opinion on how to raise a child. I was quite disappointed I wasted my time reading this waiting for it to get good.
5,"This book is a ""baby bible""!!","This book made me feel SO MUCH better about new motherhood. The fact is, I don't know about other people but I was scared, worried, tense and confused the first few months of my baby's life and this book completely zeroed in on all my worries and wiped them away. Forget that whole ""What to Expect"" thing; THIS is the book everyone who's having a baby should get. If you know anyone who's pregnant, buy it for them too because that way they won't feel isolated or alone. This author Lu Hanessian has SUCH a ""voice"" in the way she leads you through early babyhood: funny, poignant, focused, energetic, almost 'poetic' if I could put a word to it. I feel lucky to have found this book. It changed my whole perspective of motherhood! RUN, don't walk, to buy this book!!!! I love love loved it!!"
5,Inspiring...Captivating...Hilarious,"From the first page, I was drawn into this beautiful, heartwarming, and very real journey of mother and child. This is a book all parents should read...mothers and fathers alike. This is a book that anyone contemplating parenthood should read. It's candid and humorous nature and sensitivity to everyday family issues makes me want to go out and start a family of my own!"
2,Let the Baby Take Over Your Life,"The book is well-written, and often moving about the early experiences of motherhood. As it goes on, however, you really start to wonder about her choices. It seems she puts aside no burdens, imposes no boundaries or thinks that it is important her child learn to engage with other children outside of his mommy-centric world. The whole book is basically a defense of this tactic, all the while wondering why she feels so isolated in her suburban bliss. There are some good points, but I personally am tired of seeing our modern world over-run with kids and parents raised to expect the whole world to devise entirely new rules & systems just for their 'special' ways.She ends the book mentioning the importance of finding a 'fine line' between a child's uniqueness and sociability, thought the enire book is really devoted for us to witness this kid doing & saying whatever he wants, while she brings out small violins for herself. Ugh."
3,Missing many pages,More than 20 of the first pages in the book were ripped out. No where in the description did it mention this. Quite disappointed!
2,Too easy,I thught this was way too easy for my son who is going into 1st grade. Although he is the second boy and is advanced for his age. He looked through it and said that his younger brother could even do it.
3,Too EASY!,"My son is bright, but not brilliant and even the end of this book is way too easy for him. I've ordered the 1-2 book and I hope that will be better suited to his abilities. On the other hand, the 2-3 book is just about right for my other child. I guess we just have to remember that all of our children are different (duh!)."
4,"Summer Bridge Activities, K to 1st","This book is a great way to help your child maintain his/her academic skills over the summer. The book is a little too easy though. However, it does give your child confidence that he/she can cope with 1st grade."
4,Bridging the grade gap in summer,"Summer Bridge Activities-we have used these for 4 years for all 3 of our children. We use them to help the children keep up their school/academic skills over the summer break. They are a GREAT adjunct to summer reading. The books have various ""exercises"" covering all subjects in a day by day format and have ""grading"" pages with stickers and stars for completion. The children initially balk at doing them but soon enjoy ""remembering"" what they did in school!!!"
2,Old edition,"This is the 2006 edition. It is brand new, but is not the newer, revised, more user friendly 2010 version. Buyer beware!"
1,Not happy,I thought I was buying a new book. But received a used book. A child had already written in the book
1,review,Very disappointing - complete absence of authenticity. Its gone to Oxfam.9 more words required for some reason which is obscure.
3,Only good for the stories...,"Not very good if you actually plan to use this book to find haunted places. The book was published in 1985, so all the information concerning who owns the homes or businesses is out of date. Also, a number of the stories come from people who no longer live in the haunted houses or work in the haunted businesses, or from people choose to keep the locations anonymous. You have no idea if the places are still haunted or if you are even allowed to visit now. It would be nice if the author could go back and do some follow up research and update this book.If you just want to read some good ghost stories, the book is a fun read. If you want a book to help you start your search for haunted places to visit, this is not it."
4,Great for simple non DMX uses,"Provided just what we needed for a simple light set up. We did not need the DMX control of these lights, we were using the sound activation. The sound activation was adjustable and was able to pick up the beat even when the controller was very far from the speakers outside. We used the device to controll 100w bulbs, and even at full setting the controller did not let the bulbs get as bright as when they were plugged in directly."
3,70/30 cotton linen,"They're actually 70/30 cotton/linen, not 65/35 as the copy states. Aside from that, they're honest cotton/linen handkerchiefs to wipe an honest man's brow."
2,Gemini Controller,I was actually very disappointed with the quality of this controller. We had it less than 2 weeks and the joystick part broke off and the X button sticks. Wouldn't buy another one.
4,"LETS BRING'EM TO THE VISULITE THEATER IN CHARLOTTE, NC","along w/420 FUNK MOB, THIS MIGHT BE A BLAST FROM THE PAST. MAYBE EVEN ANOTHER ....""HALLUCINATION ENGINE""BILL LASWELL, BOOTSY COLLINS TYPE PRODUCTION.***** 5 STARS Thank God CD's are more durable than vinylName says it all - music to fly to, January 16, 2004Reviewer: Vadim Grigorash (Moscow, Russia) - See all my reviewsIf the hypocrites and central scrutinizers of the world weren't so narrow-minded, they would have banned this album as an illicit drug on the date of release. It flows, simmers, grooves and soars inextinguishably in a virtually seamless fusion of a dozen of ancient and modern styles with a nod to eternity. Powerful and mesmerizing enough to make a Sufi twirl. Highly recommended, even if some find it a bit recycled or repetitive after Laswell's one-too-many subsequent offerings, or too muzaky to rank on par with 'serious jazz'. Stuff of a quality rarely achieved by today's 'ethno/world' crowd."
4,Supastition - 7 Years of Bad Luck,"This album is dope. It has a nice flow and twist to it. I only listen to a few songs. One of the songs with samples in it is Falling Star. Falling Star talks about how all these people start a problem and how they overcome it. If you buy the cd and listen to that track, you'll get the message. His album also makes you think about life and what is most important in it."
4,Overall good choice,"I purchaseded this iron on Amazon several months ago after I gave up on my last, top of the line, unreliable Rowenta. The Panasonic does not have the solid, high quality feel of the Rowenta, but it actually does a better job ironing and is not as heavy or bulky. This particular model has a mirror finish - not have that brownish Teflon coating which I avoid. And I really like the removable water tank. I was worried it might leak, but it doesn't. The retractable cord is a nice feature but when extended, the weight in the base is a little light and the iron becomes a little tippy. With care, it hasn't been a problem for me. The jet of steam and spray mist features work very, very well...But the bottom line is, I haven't found an iron that gets hotter or does a better job so I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
4,Ryun,"Although not as good as a runner as Steve Prefontaine, this movie is very exceptional. A must see for serious runners."
1,BIG DISSATISFACTION,"IM SO SAD! I HAD BIG EXPECTATION FOR THIS DVD, BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A PRO- VIDEO .... DON'T LOOSE YOUR MONEY YOUTUBE HAVE BETTER VIDEOS."
1,Not Particularly Good for Anything,"Dreamweaver may seem like a novice's dream come true, but it's quite the opposite. For one thing, not only does it create messy, convoluted code; it creates code that does not conform to the HTML standard! It doesn't even insert a DOCTYPE declaration, a *must* even if the rest of the HTML is not entirely correct.If all you're doing is a quick, simple page, the HTML required can be learned in the 5 minutes it takes to get used to this program. Or, if you are designing anything more, you will run into its limitations and bloated code very quickly."
5,Excellent primer on the chemistry of the brain.,"Dr. Barondes makes an incredibly complex subject easy to understand. He packs a great deal of information into a few, well illustrated pages. The book starts in the history of neurology, then explains the structure of neurons and goes on to describe the different brain chemicals and how they work on a molecular level.Because of its clarity, this book would make an excellent textbook for teaching neurochemistry and its interactions with the mind."
5,Great Series for Children,"This is more than ""memory lane"" but a series that has children learning right from wrong and to accept responsibility for their actions not to mention learning from mistakes. You will even find them doing things they are responsible for before continuing their sleuthing (prioritizing). The stories end in the '60's, not '50's (yet, they are timeless). The titles are ""safe"" to give children / grandchildren unlike some so called modern children's titles out there that have crass content, at best, but are not previewed by parents / grandparents. The Happy Hollister's series are stories that contain good character examples with children learning to work for things and not just expect things without personal and honest effort. They also exhibit self sacrifice for the benefit of others. I am glad that the titles are being reprinted without editing to include Kindle versions by the late author's family."
5,Another Triumph,"From 'I Want Her' to 'Just One Them Thangs' to 'Nobody', and now ""I'm Not Read"", KS have always delivered the same powerful soulful bliss to each and every one of his songs. With the new release of this album, he does prove that he is 'Still In The Game'."
4,good album,"a good album come get with me ,im not ready , rumour are good tracks and too hot is a nice cover no twisted here but a good album for r & b lovers"
4,Another ONE!,"The album ""still in the game"" is New,Soft,and Slow... not one of his best but I'm sure alot of people will love it. The song ""Rumors"" ""Can we make love"" and ""Love Jones"" wit/2 short,playa,Erick Sermon are off Da Hook.. then there is ""Come and get with me"" w/Snoop are already a hit....Everyone go out and buy the album!"
5,Sombody FINALLY got it right,"This is the Sandy Denny retrospective that her fans have been waiting for! Everything about this set screams quality, from the packaging to the book to the songs themselves. Get rid of your Hannibal box set & replace it with this. You will not be sorry!!!! Although it is a bit pricy, it's worth every penny."
3,"Good, except for the noise.","I have had this mouse for a while; the noise has finally caused me to write a review. The scroll wheel on this mouse is so loud. It clicks with every single movement. Did I get a faulty product, or does the noise just not bother other people?"
2,Works great till it dies.,"Honestly I really like this mouse. Does its function and feels right. Only problem is the connection of the cable to the mouse. It is very spotty and has a good chance of breaking.I have bought two of them. First one lasted one year, the second lasted two months. So it does work, till poor quality-control sets in and it dies. Really would just buy a more expensive one. It gets really annoying to have your mouse die on you sporadically."
4,"Windows 95 is NOT supported, otherwise great mouse.","...The box clearly states that Windows 98 or higher is required. Attempting to install the driver software on a Windows 95 box brings up an dialog box informing you that it is not supported and the installation never even begins.For Windows 98, this is a great mouse. I already had one on a another system and it works very well. Given the low price I'd say it is a great deal.So as long as you are not running Windows 95, go for it, you will be very happy with this mouse."
5,The new way to mouse!,"I own this mouse and I have been using it for about 3 months now. I am thrilled with how the mouse performs, glides and scrolls. No more sticky-stuck wheel! No more broken ridges from the screw-in circle. This mouse is so sensitive you barely have to push to move it. It is also pretty neat the way that it shines a glowing red light when lifted up! Looks cool at night =0)I would say a double thumbs up for even an all thumbs person! Oh and bonus..no batteries required! Yay!"
3,What he said,"I have enjoyed using this mouse tremendously. Nice fit, no cleaning, I like the response of the wheel when scrolling it. The problem is, as someone else said, that the cable connection has started to die, and although I'm no electronics expert myself, if this thing could be unscrewed I could probably get a friend to resolder it, but now I need a new one because it dies and revives occassionally. Sometimes permanently until I unplug and replug. Also, on some older games, the mouse easily spazzes out when trying to do fast movement. Even in newer games, quick motions can confuse it. I think newer optical mice have better sampling rates which help with this. I got enough out of this mouse not to regret having purchased it, but I could not in good conscience recommend someone else buy it now, since there have to be better ones available at a comparable price."
1,Bad Microswitches,"I have one of these mice, but it wasn't purchased here. Like several other Microsoft mice I have purchased it came with a defective microswitch under the left button. Most of the time it works, but sometimes when you single-click you get a double. Microsoft mice used to be great, they are no more.I have purchased 4 or 5 of the past couple years out of brand loyalty and only 1 of them worked correctly out of the box and it only lasted a few months."
2,Try logitech wheel mouse optical instead,"I own this mouse first, then just bought another one: Logitech Wheel Mouse Optical. Logitech is clearly the better choice at a comparable price. It's (logitech) more responsive, comfortable, accurate, better feel, better look..... Unless this microsoft one is free, go get the logitech."
4,Everything A Mouse Should Be..,"I purchased this mouse some 2 months back and till date I have wondered why I didnt go out and buy this before. My beloved Logitech Trackball died on me. I wanted to get something which wasnt flashy just plain neat good looks. I purchased this for some $20 and I think I am satisfied with my purchase.There arent any hotkeys. However I've used this mouse on many surfaces. Since I purchased a laptop recently I needed a mouse that would stay with me. My desktop PC mouse is safely connected to my notebook via the USB port. Its just a breeze. I love Microsoft.I enjoy playing Age Of Empires with this and at the same time I like scrolling through web pages.Its a simple mouse that has everything a mouse should be. Not ""can"" be."
5,"No more ""Rolling"" along.","Microsofts Optical Wheel Mouse,(No Ball to clean) is very easy to use,plug it into where your old mouse is pluged. It comes with a CD that you just pop into your computer which shows you how to Adjust the mouse.You can still use the mouse even if you don't use the CD, but the CD helps you adjust your scrolling speed. (like for playing games)."
4,cheap and functional,This optical mouse is very cheap for what it is. What is it? A functional optical mouse with a scroll wheel.It gets the job done.
2,Annoying mouse,"I have used an opitical mouse for some time. I bought this Microsoft opitical wheel mouse to replace one of a different brand that had quit working. I was disappointed in this mouse for the following reasons:1. The cord (the mouse's ""tail"") is not very flexible - stiffer then any other mice I've had. What engineer decided to use a stiff cord in something that moves all the time??2. The sliding pads for some reason are made of a plastic material that has a high coefficient of friction. The mouse simply would not move freely across my desk. I cleaned the pads, fine sanded the pads, cleaned the top of my desk....all to no avail. I finally gave up on it and got a Logitech Optical Blue Mouseman mouse. It has none of the above annoyances."
5,Excellent,I was so tired of using the old mice with balls so i went out and got this bad boy. It responds very well to fast or slow movement (the older optical mice couldn't handle being moved quickly very well)An excellent choice for a consumer.
3,Optical wheel stopped working after 6 months,"The mouse worked perfectly up until today when the scroll wheel stopped responding. Still works when you press the wheel but no longer works ""as a wheel"". The rest of the mouse still works including that pointless rear facing LED which does nothing at allHmm Microsoft ... extra parts that do nothing at all ... Hmm ?"
2,not reliable,"i bought this mouse and used it for about 3 months before i started having problems. it would only work intermittently, stopping for a few seconds and then re starting a few seconds later. this would repeat about 5 times a minute, making any work impossible.After consulting the microsoft help files( refer to: Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 321122) and trying some of their fixes (it seems like quite a few other people have had this problem), i still could not fix the problem. i ended up buying a Logitech optical mouse and havent had a single problem.Before buying a microsoft mouse ask yourself, how often does my microsoft software crash? Do you really want to buy their hardware?"
1,Quality is shoddy,"I've purchased 2 of these in the last year. The last one gave up the ghost after less than 2 months. Both of them stopped and started instead of moving smoothly. I've been using these for years, and the quality has decreased significantly over time."
5,great,its good.. its microsoft.. the only mouse that has the least amount of button problems.. buy it.. stop lookin at ne more reviews.. only con is that its a lil bulky.. not great for laptops
4,Works fine,The cable is the only thing that prevents if from being a joy to use. The cable on any mouse is a drag. Literally.
3,Unwieldy yet too light,"The mouse works fine; all buttons function as they should. I use it on a Mac as a much cheaper alternative to the Mighty Mouse or Mac's other overpriced options. Yet the MS mouse doesn't fit the hand well, despite its molded shape. And it's light, almost to the point of feeling cheap and insubstantial. But again, it works fine. And the price is a bargain."
5,Great mouse!,"This mouse was a great, inexpensive buy. Good bye to a mouse with a tiny ball to get dirty and clogged."
4,"Good mouse, with a couple of minor annoyances","I've used MS wheel mice for years. When my old non-optical wheel mouse went to rodent heaven this morning I replaced it with one of these. It's a good, simple mouse with much smoother movement than my previous non-optical. The only problems I've encountered are:1) Compared with the previous mouse, the scroll wheel feels flimsy and wobbles around in its housing. You're never quite sure if you've moved/clicked it or not.2) The button action is too sensitive. I keep accidentally clicking the right button just by resting my finger on it. Again, this might just be because I'm used to the previous mouse, which has a much firmer, more positive button action.Overall though, it responds very well, and I'm sure I'll get used to the above niggles with time! I was also glad that I could plug it straight into my PC running Linux and it worked first time - no configuration needed."
4,Great mouse,"Great mouse, very responsive, glides well, only objection is the bloody wire its attached to, sometimes it gets in the way, and its hard to clean sometimes, because of its texture. I love this mouse for gaming, never missed a shot =P"
3,A pretty good mouse....,"I got this mouse on sale over a year ago and it's workedflawlessly with two different Windows 98SE systems (connectedthrough the mouse port). I've had no problems with it atall. Smooth scrolling, decent with FPS games. All in allit's a good deal."
3,Adequate Optical Mouse,"As the price would suggest, this mouse in nothing special. It gets the job done, but that's about all you can say for it. Of course, we're talking about a mouse here, so it doesn't really need to do anything special except point where you direct it to.I found one annoying design element, this mouse has extremely loose action on the scroll wheel. If you like some feedback from your mouse scroll wheel, stay away from this model."
5,perfect,I bought this mouse when it was first released and have never had a problem with it since then. I've also purchased two more for my other PCs and just bought the new explorer blue optical.The current price/value ratio for this mouse is incredible. You just can't go wrong buying this mouse either for office or gaming.
4,Nice basic mouse,"Fine, basic optical mouse. Good, classic feel. Buttons are a bit loud for me, but, my wife uses it."
1,Not 2 months,before the mouse just cuts off for no reason. I think it is a chord problem that the seller denied when I complained of at purchase.
2,If you're going to spend the money...,"...buy something that feels well-made. For utility, it's a mouse - and that's all. If you spend any amount of time using your computer though, you'll notice it feels cheap, and the (completely unnecessary) red light on the back of the mouse is very distracting. I highly recommend, instead of this mouse, the Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse. It is much more pleasent to use, especially for long periods of time."
5,Pretty Good Mouse,"Easy to use, quite precise and a good buy. The wire is a little long for my convenience but it's not that big of a problem."
2,"Too big, not responsive","The size of the mouse is too big and exacerbates carpal tunnel when used over a long period of time. Also, the refresh rate is slow, making it unsuitable for FPS games. I eventually had to go out and buy a Logitech optical mouse to replace this one."
2,would not work with windows 98,"I bought this mouse and spent at least a week trying to install it. I could not get it to work at all. There was nothing mechanically wrong with the mouse, since it worked on the computers at the shop I bought it from. I was told that the problem was with windows 98, and that I needed a usb patch. Got the patch, but it still would not work. Went to the microsoft site to get help online, but they didn't want to know about it. After about a 10 days I gave up and returned it to the shop."
3,This is too big.,"I just got this mouse a few days ago.This one is fine, but this one is pretty big.So just after few minutes, I usely feel tired on my wrist.You better find smaller one than this one."
3,"Great mouse, stiff scrollwheel","Very disappointing. The scrollwheel feels nothing like the several previous MS Mice I purchased. My oldest mouse no longer slides across the desk smoothly (they've since improved the pads considerably), and my newest one gave up the ghost after about 7 or 8 years of heavy use. This mouse's scrollwheel is very stiff, and feels like it takes twice as much force to scroll than both of those, making it immediately feel awkward to use. Be wary about this if you're used to previous versions.Now I have to live with this for the next 5 years or decide if I want to take a gamble on another mouse. I'm hoping maybe it will loosen up after a breaking-in period, but I have my doubts."
4,Mouse to glide or not to glide,"Mouse is comfortable, was very pleased at first. Now for some reason glides stick some, have tried cleaning no go. I might try different mouse pad next."
4,A basic optical mouse,"This is a basic optical mouse. I have no complaints functionality-wise. It is definitely smoother than the old ball-mouse. But, somehow, I don't like the feel of it in my palm. I had gotten used to the ergonomic design of a right-handed MS intellimouse. Since this mouse is designed to be used by both right and left handed, compromises have been made on the design compared to the Intellimouse. I feel that it doesn't fit into my palm. May be it is just a matter of getting used to it, but if I had known this is going to be a misfit like this, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Best mouse I have ever owned,"This mouse is amazing. I've had it for over a year and it still functions perfectly. I must be hard on mice, because until I bought this one I was going through about one every four months. The laser movement tracker is pinpoint accurate and amazingly precise. The buttons are quiet and work perfectly even when abused. It fits comfortably in your hand and even has a pleasant texture. I've gone through over a dozen roller-ball type mice and one other brand of laser mouse. Even in the category of laser mice, this one is the best, in my opinion."
5,Finally a Great Mouse!,"I've finally found this Great Mouse that has no ball to get clogged with dust, hair and lint. There's no reason to have to disassemble this mouse! Once you plug it in, YOU ARE SET! It's just that simple. And the IntelliPoint software that comes with it makes simple tasks even simpler! No way can you go wrong by buying this mouse! So what are you waiting for??"
4,Better than a trackball mouse.,"This is a great mouse. I use this one at work and the only better one I can recommend is the cordless optical. This is a great mouse because there's no trackball, which means better control and no mess to clean all the time. It's a nice fit in your hand and you can set the many different buttons to do what you want."
5,sleek and sweet,Ok i got this mouse with the computer i ordered and found it really nice.There is no hassle of cleaning it and stuff and the shape is also very good.The central roller wheel is very very smooth to turn and works like a charm!If you haven't switched to optical mouse yet then this baby is for you!
3,Former star reborn,Does listening to this man's music put anybody in mind of another? How about my favorite version of Bobby McGee done by Kris Kristofferson? These two voices and delivery style seem very much alike. I still love Kristofferson (always will) and may add Chris Ledoux to my list.
3,Okay for what it is,"You would not want to use this to learn to play the piano. If you really want to play, you need a real keyboard with regular action and raised keys, to help your fingers get around. Also the sound on this unit is not something you'd really want to show off. If you can get a real piano, you should. But as a temporary substitute this is okay. It certainly has the advantage of convenience. I took this with me in my backpack so that I could practice on voice parts when I had a spare minute somewhere that I can spread it out."
2,Don't waste your time with this.,"This unit has no piano feel and the sound is very bad from the unit. The biggest complaint I have is the touch of the unit is messed up so when you press a ""key"" it sounds once or several times depending on its mood. You cannot use this to play but as a toy it may be OK for kids."
1,Return denied,"I decided that I could not really use the piano keyboard and tried to return it to American Clocks. They e-mailed me a return label, but I could not open it. They e-mailed it again; I could not open it. I asked them to snail-mail it to me. They did not. I called them twice, and they said they would send the label. They did not. So, I am very unhappy with this matter. Incidentally, the piano keyboard is still in the original box. I did not open it."
2,Meh.,"I had some trouble following this. Normally I cut much slack for genre movies, but this one was just bad. The advertising that it features Tony Jaa. Tony is in the film - but not much.Silly flick, bad acting and bad writing. It had some humorous moments. Better luck next time..."
5,Great release from these Buffalo boys,"This might be the strongest release from ETID, a band that has gone relatively unnoticed in the metalcore, grindcore, whatever their calling it today genre. The band's progression over the past few albums (Hot Damn! & Gutter Phenomenon) has made for memorable music in comparison to their counterparts in the genre, which have all seemed to go down hill with an emo sounding cry. The Big Dirty continues the evolution of the band, but keeps the main parts that made the other albums so great, thrashing guitars, great beats from ""Ratboy"", and every twisting turns that always keep their sound fresh. They call Emo the new punk, this is the sound that I picture when I hear ""new punk"". Tracks to check out if you haven't already: INRIhab, We'rewolf, Imitation is the Most Sincere Form of Battery and Depressionista."
4,Classic ETID,"If you liked their previous work, do yourself a favor and get this album. It's hard hitting classic Every Time I Die. If you take the time to pay attention the lyrics they are as meaningful as always, but you can also take a break and just rock out (and it would be difficult to find a better CD this year to rock out to)."
2,Eh....,"Good for what it is? Maybe. I just can't get into it. Seeing as how I've been a fan of ETID since Last Night In Town, thats not too surprising. I think it really depends on when you started listening to them. If you were a fan of Last Night In Town, The Burial Plot Bidding War, or Hat Damn!, then more than likely this album won't be your style. If you were a big fan of Gutter Phenomenon, then this will probably be right down your alley.Honestly, this whole album reminds me of The New Black, and god do I hate that song."
2,NOT Standard Soprano Strings! PLEASE READ!,"I ordered these wrong strings ( D'Addario J65) thinking they are the standard ""C"" tuning for the Soprano Uke.The D'Addario J65 is the B, F#, D, A strings/notes for ALTERNATIVE ukulele tuning or ""D"" tuning.These are good D-tuning strings for the uke. But remember these are NOT and CANNOT be tuned to the regular G, C, E, A tuning or C-tuning.If you like D'Addario strings, get the D'Addario J53 Ukulele Strings.It will be a little longer for the soprano ukes, since it is concert sized,but just cut the extra length off. It is the Standard Strings G, C, E, A.2 stars for not enough information and wrong ""Product Features"" description for the D'Addario J65.I would give it 4 stars if I wanted my uke tuned to D-tuning all the time,but I would have to relearn new ukulele chord and fingering patterns.Amazon should show the back of the package as it is labeled with B, F#, D, A strings."
4,Ukulele strings,"Nice sound, especially for the price. I use more expensive ones on my ukes but always keep some of these handy, just in case."
4,Bari Uke Strings,These are excellent strings for the money. Great quality and a good sound create the best possible value. I have trusted D'Addario to make quality products for whatever instrument I am playing.
5,Instant Improvement,"I bought a couple of packs of these for the two ukuleles we recently bought. While the strings that originally came with mine weren't bad at all, replacing them with these made the instrument much louder.My husband's uke had horrible strings with it. He tuned it and said that it just didn't sound ""ukulele enough"". I tuned it and its tone was still very ""flat"" sounding. There was an instant improvement after we replaced the strings with these strings, and everything sounded approximately 93.6% better.Yay for new strings!"
1,Wrong description!,"Despite the claim in the description of ""Set of six strings Musical Notes E,B,G,D,A,E"", this is actually only four strings with the non-standard tuning of B, F#, D, A."
3,these do work in standard tuning,"i got a set of these strings at my music store and like everybody else, i thought that they were the wrong strings too, so i took them back to the store and was told that you can use them, and here is howstarting from the top of your strings on your ukulele not the bottomB-1st tune to GF#-2nd tune to CD-3rd tune to EA-4th tune to Ayou will see that on the string packeges they are marked b-1st and so on, i followed what i was told and they sound just fine, way better then the cheap strings that were on my cheap ukulele, allthough i do think that they should be labled better on the package.and remember, nylon strings will stretch ""ALOT""."
2,Inaccurate product description,"I was looking to purchase strings for a soprano ukulele, and after reading the title of this product I placed my order. I should have been careful to examine the product details, as they are rife with inconsistencies. The page describes soprano ukulele strings other than those pictured, as well as guitar strings. This careless posting lead me to purchase strings that are not ideally suited for standard soprano tuning. I should have read other customer reviews, but I'm surprised that no updates have been made to the information in the year since users started noting the inaccuracies in their reviews.Very displeased with the product description and title. The strings are perfectly adequate ukulele strings, provided you don't mind changing the tuning or placing your instrument under undue stress by re-configuring the strings for standard C tuning."
3,Metal strings like to unwind,"I've gone through two sets now and I keep waking up in the morning on random days to either metal string unwinding and being unusable. I don't want to de-tune after each time I play because I just want to pick it up and strum. Perhaps the holes where the strings are held need to be made smaller somehow. They sound great though, but the unwinding prevents even four stars."
1,Horrible,These strings are horrible! I will never put them on my uke ever again. I'd rather have kept my old cheap strings that were originally on my uke.
3,tenor ukulele string review,The strings were hard to fret but gave a nice louder sound when strummed. I guess this might not be good strings for beginners. These string are great when combined with Aquila and Fremont ukulele strings.
1,Not soprano,Not standard soprano strings.. I hope that others take the time to read the reviews ... I wish I had now.. be aware!
1,you never know what you're gonna get.,"I ordered these strings and waited in excitement, as my tenor uke was long overdue for a re-stringing. When the strings finally arrived, i was utterly confused and disappointed to discover that while the packaging looked just like the picture shown for this product, each individual string was in a packet labeled ""Classical Guitar Strings"". WHAT!? Ok, I'm not familiar with classical guitar strings whatsoever, and ok, maybe tenor uke strings and classical guitar strings are one and the same. whatever the case may be, i felt duped. PACKAGING FAIL."
4,Bright sounding strings,"First off, I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert, however, reading up on this, they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said, it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke, but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also, I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch. I would definitely recommend these."
5,titanium concert Ukulele Strings,The strings are good.they have great sound and once they go through their stretching period that hold a tone well and sound great!i am really happy with this product.I think that everyone should at least try a pair.They are pretty great.
4,"D'Addario J65 Ukulel strings, soprano","I bought these strings to replace for my 30 year ukulele that had the original strings on it. They were well labeled, identifying each string & placement on the uke.They are super long, and after cutting them to size, there seems to be enough for a second set of replacements. Good price too. Would recommend."
4,A New Wave-Power Pop Classic,"Lennon and McCartney were once asked what the name Beatles meant. ""It's just a name, just like shoe,"" replied Lennon. ""We could have been called the Shoes for all you know,"" added McCartney [Stark, 108]. Nearly a decade later, brothers Jeff and John Murphy called their band the Shoes, whose music is best described as new wave (Blondie, Cheap Trick) infused with a heavy dose of power pop (Moon Martin, the Knack). The band created a bit of a stir in the late '70s with Black Vinyl Shoes, an album it recorded and distributed on its own (unheard of at the time); the homemade LP was successful enough to land the Shoes a deal with Elektra. ""Tomorrow Night"" and ""Too Late,"" both from the Present Tense LP, remind me of other songs from the period: The Inmates' ""Dirty Water,"" the Records' ""Starry Eyes,"" and the Rockets' ""Oh Well."""
1,a good story presented in an awkward format,"Although I enjoyed the story itself, this deluxe edition really didn't do anything for me. The book is 9.5 x 13 which makes it awkward to handle, hard to read and difficult to store. Fernando Duval did the illustrations and are alright at best. Supposed to be limited to 1000 copies. The book is autographed by Duval but not numbered. Not that it would make any difference. Overpriced, stick to the regular hardbound edition unless you are into odd-sized books."
3,"Perfect tale, laughable cover.",The first thing you'll notice when picking up this issue of H.P. Lovecraft's cult classic is that there's some kind of yeti and a weird portal on the cover. Clearly the illustrator read something different than the rest of us.
4,Interesting and suspenseful read,I don't quite know what to make of this - I barely knew of all the references the author made to older time periods but the story builds up a good suspense and it really does seem like it's a horror story. I wish they could make this into a movie but not sure how.
3,James,"A good yarn about the Antarctica and what was found there. If you were not aware it was fiction, it reads as a true life great adventure. Lovecraft wrote a lot,most of his stories are worth reading"
2,Where are the Mexican states?,"Despite each of the ""estados"" of Mexico having more autonomy than the US states or Canadian provinces do individually, the mapmakers chose to only include the Canadian and US political divisions. The only question I can ask is, why?"
1,Not a Shredder!,"I should have read the reviews before buying. This device is not a shredder in any sense. It does not shred! It makes some pits on the data side to make it harder to read, but leaves the actual data layer fully intact! How can you call this device a shredder?!? A complete rip off, and offers virtually no security."
4,DVD/CD Shredder,Works great. Run it through the shredder & toss. No need to worry- can't retrieve any data off the disk
2,false advertising!!,"This level came to me in an previously opened package, and with dents, and nicks in it. Then they were painted over with ""white-out"" I contacted the seller and they were less than intersested in what I had to say. I would not recomend anybody buy products from this seller. BE AWARE!!!!"
1,Broke First time out,"The Mojo Critter broke the first time out. I set the unit up, turned it on, and the gears started clicking but the top piece did not move. I could spin it by hand, but it would not turn on it's own. I tried another set of batteries, but it still didn't work. It was cold that day (10 deg. F), so I don't know if this had anything to do with it, but I will definately be sending it back."
2,Decent,"I purchased the mojo critter for eastern predators. And while the action on the critter is good, the quality of the construction isn't the best. Flimsy battery cover was an issue for me. The small tab tore off on the first opening. Warranty dept. told me to send it back, but I needed it that weekend and they weren't willing to just mail me another cover. I'm looking for another brand and i'll use this as a back up."
4,"overall, good service","Package was as described, however it was not incredibly well packaged. The box had been damaged in transit, and since there was very little padding or packing inside, the product was dented and plastic smashed. Still very pleased with seller, but would have liked more care in packaging as it was a gift."
3,Works fine,Haven't had the time to use it yet but tried it out in the yard and it seems to work as advertised.The only con is the battery compartment. They don't really tell you how to get it open and I thought I was going to break it before I could get it open
3,have not used it yet,This decoy looks like it will be effective. Runs quiet and does look to be interesting to predators. Should do the trick.
2,Painted plastic. Ok performance.,"I bought this shower head because I read about the bacterial growth problems with plastic shower heads. I *thought* I was getting an all metal shower head then I noticed each hole in the shower head was actually plastic. I looked closer and saw the ""metal"" was actually silver paint over plastic. So cheap and completely NOT what I wanted. Overpriced for what it is. Ok performance if you like lower water pressure over a wider spread. Not adjustable at all except for the angle. I would not buy again and would look a different brand that doesn't try to hide behind silver paint."
5,It's a Blast,"I've used several of these and been very satisfied. The Forte is almost identical except for some styling differences, this one is currently lower price. Internally the showerhead appears identical to the Forte, so if you have water pressure problems read the review on removing the Forte flow restrictor."
5,Great DVD,"I love this particular DVD the best out of all the Hillsong Cd's.This one has a special sound.Each song is realy good,and has a great mixture of tunes that make you want to dance to them.As well as some fantastic more spiritual songs.It is the first one i heard so it holds a special place for me.Every release from Hillsong is exciting,but this one just sits the best of all for me.It has Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team at their best.I have both the cd and DVD to this.WHen you listen to this you find out why Hillsong have been so successful,great praise and worship."
2,If potential kitchen fires are your best part of waking up..,"I bought my first Krups Cafe Express about 8 months ago from Bed Bath & Beyond. I was looking for a small coffee maker b/c I have a small apartment & don't drink much coffee, so this one was perfect. It worked great for the first 3-4 months, until one morning I went to turn it on & the on/off button not only fell off, but sparks and smoke blew out the place where the button once was. I returned it to the store and exchanged it for another one, exact same model (I really like the coffee maker), yet again 4 months later the button popped off and out came sparks and smoke. So needless to say I won't be buying another, it makes great coffee and it fits well in a small kitchen, but this manufacturing flaw makes it really not worth it."
3,This is an ok little machine . . .,"I wouldn't recommend it to the coffee enthusiast. It does makes decent coffee, but a comparable Braun 4-cup machine we have makes much better coffee. The build seems cheap but is very adequate. I would expect much better from a company with such a reputation, but this little device holds its own against cheaper machines like Mr. Coffee."
3,"Well, it makes coffee, but...","I live in a cramped city studio apartment and struggle for counter space, so at least as far as that goes, this coffee maker is just right. It fulfills the very basic function of a coffee maker-brews the coffee in about five minutes. However, it's a pain to clean the urn, the nylon permanent filter lets coffee grinds through (personal pet peeve, I hate that) and it is not a sturdy, well-made appliance by far. Its price reflects its quality. If you want a space age, entirely self-sufficient coffee maker that understands you and has wonderful coffee ready before it even hits your conscious mind, this is not the product for you. If you are a poor recent college grad, this is pretty much it."
1,"One week after owning this, and the carafe already broke","I bought this coffee maker because I live in a small city apartment and need every bit of space I can muster. Well, it is small, but the coffee takes like 5 minutes to brew, whereas my last maker only took about one minute. Also, while washing my dishes today I noticed that the carafe is already broken at the spout. My last carafe could be tossed around my sink and never break! Thank God I still have my old one in storage. Buyer beware."
2,"Good size, but lousy coffee","This works great as a desk size coffee maker, only if you're counting the size as a factor.However, the coffee it turns out is so-so. I roast and grind my own beans, and have had wonderful flavors in just about every coffee maker. Except this one. I even pitched the permanent nylon filter for the gold Krups permanent filter, but the resulting coffee tastes too much like institutional ground coffee. If this is what you like, then good for you."
2,"Good Features, Poor Coffee","I was hoping this would be the perfect little office coffee-maker, but I am disappointed. It had the features I wanted... permanent mesh filter and removable reservoir for easy clean-up. But it just does not get the water hot enough to make a good tasting cup of coffee !!! A common fault of many inexpensive coffee makers."
3,Only OK...,"I find the coffee is pretty decent, not great. But the worst thing is that the coffee never gets hot! I always have to nuke it in the microwave, especially after pouring milk in it (even after waiting for the burner to get hot).I love the small design, it's very cute. I don't find it hard to clean and I haven't had problems with things coming off. Seems like a case of 'you get what you pay for' - I'd say it's decent for the price, but if you're a real coffee fanatic this isn't for you."
2,Doesn't Get Hot Enough !,"Nice coffeemaker, good features - it just doesn't get the coffee hot enough and I will be replacing mine."
5,The Southwest shines through in every song. I love it!,"Bill and Bonnie's husky and hearty sounds make me lonesome for the clubs and the mountains they call home - Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. There's country style backup on traditionals including one of Bill's heroes, Buck Owens. There's mandolins and other instrumental and vocal support from Herb Peterson and Chris Hillman. Their harmonies with Bonnie on her featured song are haunting - shades of Linda or Emmylou, two of Bonnie's favorites. ""Bartender's Blues"", ""L.A. Freeway"", and ""Ridin' Behind"" bring back the best, and Bill's pickin' is, as usual, incredibly good. This is a collection you won't want to miss! ""Mr. Record Man,"" Set up another Bonnie solo or two next time, ""won't you please!"" Marilyn Smith, Louisville, Ky"
3,Good Listenin' American Songs,"Just bought this from the dust bin at a favorite music store. It's sweet. The songs are straight forward Americana and Bill & Bonnie sing without the in-yer-face frills that can so easily ruin a tune. They are genuine, front porch artists and this is a true easy going feel good cd. I wonder what John Morthland (Amazon Reviews) was listening to?"
2,nice but not waterproof,"Just like I said with the other Tour Master products, these are not waterproof. I went for a ride and had to poor the water out when I was done."
3,Ed's review of Assured Response,"The author is very knowledgable about military aircraft. The story is riveting, but I found some of the sub plots a little ""too unbelievable"". I couldn't believe that skilled pilots like Jackie Sullivan and Scott Dalton would knowingly fly into the teeth of a severe thunderstorm. I'm a WWII pilot and didn't understand why he brought in the old B-25s to drop atomic bombs. The novel is gripping and is I assume is what he intended, i.e, a ""Worst Case Scenario"". It is realistic to paint the Muslim Fanatics as unconscionable and absolutely without morals, decency, or humanity.. My biggest problem with this novel was that Mr. Weber tried to crowd too much material, too many plots into the story."
1,Horrible,"If you MUST read this book, get it at the library. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this boring ""To Be Continued"" rag. I cared absolutely nothing about the characters. The attacks on the USA, while interesting and plausible were never resolved. When the ending mercifully came you could not imagine the look on my face.. Absolutely dumbfounded that Weber would end it that way.. At least now I know never to take a flyer on him again..."
5,GREAT!,this was a great karaoke cd for all ages with her best songsi had this at a party and we had a ball!
2,Disappointing....,"Being italian, I really wanted to taste a good espresso at home. After 2 years of using it on daily base and with a real italian coffee for espresso makers, it is leaking. I don't really know if I abused it or it is just not good enough. What I know is that even the cheapest espresso maker in Italy would last longer (20 cups/day in italy versus 1 cup/day).Bottom line: today we can find for the same price coffee makers with better quality (15 bars, for example), still we don't know for how long they will survive"
5,Espresso,Very very goodor maybe its just mebut I like this product anyway15 pounds of pressure which isnt mentioned is here toomakes for good froth and espressp
2,Shopping for new machine,I too am shopping for a new machine. The expresso is weak no matter how I grind the beans. The frother has never worked well. It leaks water while trying to froth.
1,This product did not meet my expections,"The product did not meet my expectations. I have purchased KRUPS products and had two KRUPS coffee machines. One that lasted over 10 years and the second I gave to my daughter.This specific model did not work after one month and I do not have a coffee machine for the morning jolt.Now, I have to go to Macy's to purchase another machine.I need to return this item and obtain a credit. I await your reply."
4,works ok...try a harder tamp,"I've been using my Gusto daily for about a year, at the office, mostly for straight espresso shots. It works best when I use the ""double"" basket in the portafilter, PRE-WARMED, with 2 scoops of freshly roasted coffee, ground three clicks back from 0 on a Starbuck's Barista low-speed conical burr grinder. Add one scoop, level, tamp lightly, add the second scoop, level, and tamp using aprox. 30 pounds of pressure. Then polish the grounds by twisting the tamper while pushing down. Space between top surface of coffee and top of portafilter should be about 3-4mm. (if you install the portafilter, then take it back off and the imprint of the screen retaining screw is in your coffee, you're using too much coffee) Pull the shot for 18-23 sec. into a PRE-WARMED shot glass and Oh YEAH! Gotta go...just talking about it and I'm jonesin' for the stuff! But I'm not addicted. Nope...good luck!"
3,Update,"Bought this machine last september and thought it was horrible at first. Turns out that it's actually pretty good once you learn how to use it properly. Make sure to prime the machine by letting the water heat up, then turn the pump on and let it run through the empty filter basket until the water temp light comes back on. This also lets you pre-warm your espresso cups (or shot glasses). I have Starbucks grind the espresso beans to espresso-grind (don't use coarser grinds unless you like weak espresso). I use the double filter as well...do not over-pack it or over-tamp the grounds or else the pump gets stuck (put in one scoop, lightly tamp, then add second level scoop and tamp a little harder). Draw for about 30 seconds, and you should get a nice crema on top. Sometimes the pump ""squeals,"" but it hasn't blown up yet or stopped working. Good luck!"
4,a good espresso machine for the money,"I'm reading all of these reviews and I'm surprised. If you want a professional espresso machine, spend a few hundred, or thousand, dollars. For under $100, this machine makes a pretty good espresso. It's not the best espresso that I've ever had, but it's good. I've used other machines that made lousy espresso. This isn't one. I'm happy with this machine."
4,"A nIce molded plastic tray and box, not ""lacquer""","I ordered a few of these. I was expecting to receive some nice quality ""Lacquered"" bento box just like the ones we found at the Japanese restaurant. In fact, these were just removable molded plastic trays (the red part) with a black rectangular plastic box. I doubt that this is BPA free (there is no description of the material printed anywhere), so I wouldn't dare putting food that's too hot in there. I actually like the fact that these bento boxes are just plastic, because it's more low maintenance than the lacquer ones. I just wished that the seller of this product had not put up that mis-leading title name and description, which makes me feel tricked into paying more for plastic."
5,Macromedia is a god send,The Dreamweaver4/Fireworks4 suite is excellent.I can't say enough good things about it.If you need to build a website and you don't havethe time to go to school buy and learn this suite.
4,"Not exactly objective but hilarious, from the heart.","This is a unique Diana biography, for while it is humourous (and often outrageously rude about Charlie and Camilla et al) you can feel Burchill's anger, sorrow and sense of injustice bubbling away just under the surface throughout.I remember that Julie Burchill always stuck up for Diana in her various newspaper and magazine columns throughout the eighties and early nineties so at least we know that this author isn't one of those (and there seem to be many) who have only become Diana admirers since August 31st 1997.A refreshingly forthright book, then, and one that will horrify, to borrow one of its more fragrant phrases, `Windsor brown-nosers' everywhere."
3,"3 stars - for the pictures, this is one mean spirited book","I've got this book in the hardback edition and I've got to say this is one mean spirited book. Ms. Burchill writes for The Guardian, a liberal left leaning British paper and she is obviously what the British would call a strong republican. It appears to me that this book is an attack on the Monarchy from the first page to the last. Princess Diana herself would probably not have been spared if she'd gone along with the system. As with all the other Diana books you get some good photos but this one is a little too mean otherwise."
1,Garbage,"This book is garbage. The writing is near-illiterate and the facts wrong. Save your money. ""Diana: The Life of a Troubled Princess"" is so much better as to be in a different world."
2,Heartless Fretboard Magic,"Frank Zappa once called Steve Vai ""The master of impossible guitar parts."" Occasionally on this haphazard collection Vai proves he has incredible technical ability and virtousic chops. His rendition of a Mozart piece(taken from the movie Crossroads)is as transcendent as Jimmy Paige's version of ""Greensleaves"". Unfortunately Vai's strengths turn out to be his greatest weaknesses, hes a wicked guitarist but not much of a musician, Example: The first two tracks he tries his hand at singing......in other words you might want to pass those up. Most of the time his playing has the air of an athlete showing all the girls how much he can bench press rather then a musician making a statement.Melodies are rare in Vai's world and he attempts to blind with speed rather then bare his heart. In conclusion Vai could learn some lessons from one of his own songs, ""Celluloid Heroes"""
1,Give me a break,"I Love Steve's guitar playing, but I wish that he would get his act together and make a ""real"" c.d. The world has seen enough greatest hits & compilation c.d.s, what fans really want is a c.d. with top quality music on every track. Unfortunately, this is nowhere near that. I am totally disappointed..."
4,Glad to Have It,"This is a collection of tracks written for or inspired by movie soundtracks. I bought it for the tracks from the movie Crossroads. Back when the Crossroads soundtrack hit the shelves, I was seriously bummed that the music from the headcutting duel scene was not included. Well, it's all here. Unfortunately, the sound quality of those tracks is not as good as I'd expected. But at least I've now got them.The other tracks vary significantly in their appeal to me, but overall, I give a thumbs up. I've been a Steve Vai fan since the days when he played what Frank Zappa called ""stunt guitar"" for Frank's band. Was that really 20 years ago? I guess it was...Steve's an incredible technician, but his music has always had his own unique attitude and for me, that's what sets him apart from so many other guitar heroes. The music on this disc covers quite a range of material. If you're into solo guitar, you'll probably find something to like."
4,The Job Is Done,"This record is plain and simple - a collection of music that Steve has contributed to film over the years. If you are a Vai fan or a fan of guitar, then this is a CD to have in the collection. If you know nothing about Vai and/or his music, this CD won't leave a good taste in the mouth.No, it's not a CD that will live in your player, nor was it intended to be. To speak for others and say that the public doesn't want compilation CD's or greatest hits is illogical. Opinions are great and we are all entitled to them, but there is not one person that has the right to speak for others.This was a treat for the fans that could not purchase the box set. An added bonus for those who have the box set by going the next step and spending the money on a 3D cover and a special package. I wish there were more artists out there that are willing to go the extra mile for the fans like Steve did on this."
3,Not sure.,"I am a person who is obcessed with famous legendary metal guitar players like: yngwie malmsteen (rising force) kai hansen(helloween/gamma ray) michael schenker & uli jon roth (UFO). And I wanted atleast one of steve vai's albums to add in my collection of my other famous guitarist's and I was searching in my local barnes and nobles cd store and they only had this album in stock and I didn't want to buy online anyway. This cd has 40 tracks of steve vai's crazy solos with classic rock blues and pop from some of the movies he's composed in but most of these tracks are skits and some are like 3 minutes and something seconds long. His solo's are pure solid gold but this album was not meant for new fans like me and I wish I found another album from steve vai, But this album was not really bad at all but it's not one of the best places to start for new fans like me.Overall I enjoyed this album and I enjoyed steve vai's gifted talent."
3,"Villain's great, but the hero deserved to be grated","This book is a combination of two extremes: on one hand, a detailed, capturing portrait of the nefarious Hederick, no more than three pages in the ""Chronicles"" Saga. On the other hand... a pathetic group of mismatched ""heroes"": a seventy year-old ex-Seeker, a misguided but well-meaning mage, a thief who seems to be the only sensible character, and centaurs and kender and slaves for no reason than they could be there. There are some pointless chapters but a lot of good scenes with Hederick. If you can get past the fact there isn't much of a good guy to root for, you can see one of the best examples of villany in this book, in the title character."
1,PASS,"This book is written as ugly as Hederick looks on the cover. It ambles along like I imagine Hederick walks, all out of breath and stuggling to make it to the end.My dog tore up the book the other morning, and I can only imagine that she read it and felt the same way I do about this book."
1,Mini stereo,Not at all impressed. Had to return it as it wasn't a complete set. Seemed like wouldn't have lasted very long anyways so was glad to return it.
1,Not reliable,"Player will start to skip when it gets deep into a disc. Works sometimes, sometimes not. I don't recommend this player."
1,bad sound,This is overpriced and has bad sound! You would look at the size of the speakers and think it would be good. It has poor sound and absolutely no bass whatsoever. I do not recommend buying this product or any product made by Coby. I recommend Sony micro hi-fi component system. Smaller speakers but much better sound!!! You can also hook ipods or mp3s up to it too.
1,Follow up to trailer & VW commercial,"As stated above, the music to the TV trailer is Mr. Blue Sky from The Electric Light Orchestra (or ELO). The song in the VW commercial is indeed Mr. Blue Sky, but it is a remake that is not ELO. I'm disapointed they used ELO music in the trailer and not in the movie. I WAS going to buy the soundtrack and see the movie for that reason. :[ I saw a new trailer for this movie today, and they again used an ELO song (can't remember which one now)."
5,Another Mr Blue Sky,"Yes ELO did a Mr Blue Sky, the movie one i think, but the WV commercial maybe by Triple Fast Action, they also did a version....i jus like the end of the WV commercial that goes ""baaaaa ba ba ba ba baaaaaa ba ba ba ba""...u kno what i mean lol, both versions have it so it doesnt matter, also Nerf Herder did a rock remake...hope this helps"
4,For those looking for the trailer song,"The song on the adaptation trailer, as well as the VW convertible commercial is not on this cd. U can find it on the album ""out of the blue"" by the electric light orchestra. The song is called ""mr. blue sky"" (for those with kazaa :D ) Hope i helped someone out there"
5,Essential reading for anyone who cares about Israel,"""Prophets Outcast"" is a gripping, eye-opening collection of some of the smartest and most knowledgeable writers of the 20th century -- including Freud and Einstein, as well as historians and analyists of the present situation -- all concerned about the anti-democratic forces within Israel and Zionism that deny Palestinian rights to statehood. Several of the contributors are Israelis, and their arguments are particulary powerful. It's a deeply moral book, and an antidote to the despair that seems so pervasive today. The introduction, by Adam Shatz, effectively combines passion and reason: the issue, he argues, is not whether Jews will remain in Israel-Palestine, but where -- within the 1967 borders, or in a Greater Israel; and on what terms -- in an increasingly theocratic state, or in a democracy based on Arab-Jewish equality."
1,"simply dull, a bit absurd, bordering on gag-worthy","I could barely make it through to the middle of this book. The author (Shatz) seems to have dedicated his life to anti-zionism... and, okay, so be it. But as a gentile agnostic, I find the idea of collecting writings of jews who detest Israel to be a ploy, as if just because they are Jewish, they know better than the rest of us that it is right to be anti-israel. Yet Shatz writes for the Nation with arrogant, cynical bitterness about Ajami, an Arab who frequently takes on the Arab establishment! Mr. Shatz, if you, a Jew delight in finding other jews who are anti-zionist, then why does it stun you that an Arab might be against Arab nationalism? Hail a clue taxi."
2,It's obviously a low budget tv miniseries.,The settings and costumes reveal this as a low budget tv miniseries. The plot is interesting because it's different than most other films of this kind. The acting and fighting scenes are below average.
1,assassin swordsman,this movie sucked!!!! ITS IN THE TRASH CAN. DONT BUY THIS CHEAP MOVIE!!!!!!!!THIS WAS A 40 HOUR MOVIE SERIES EDITED TO ABOUT 90 MINUTES WHAT WERE THEY THINKING.WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.I COLLECT MARTIAL ART MOVIES AS AHOBBY.CHING SUI TUNG/YUEN WO PING MAKE SOME OF THE BEST MOVIES OUT THERE .. CHING SUI TUNG DID THE FIGHT SCENES FOR THIS MOVIE...DIDNT HELP....SEYA AT THE MOVIES
2,Disappointing,Thought there would be alot more in this book. This book should have been on the hexagram and the history of Rempham worship. Was very disappointed.
3,JUST A FEW GEMS,"OUTSTANDING ARE INVISIBLE TEARS, AL DI LA, AND POTRAIT OF MY LOVE. FOR UP UP AND AWAY, GO FOR. RAY CONNIFF AND HIS SINGERS. AND FOR LOVE ME WITH ALL YOUR HEART GO FOR RAY CHARLES SINGERS. THIS COLLECTION IS REALLY ALL YOU NEED FROM JOHNNY MANN SINGERS!"
1,Yu-gi-oh Figures,"The figures are very cute, but smell like skunk. I have washed them, aired them out, and soaked them. The odor will not come out. So if you want very cute Yu-gi-oh figures, and can get passed the smell, order these.....if you have a good nose, stay clear."
4,"Yu-Gi-Oh Vending Machine Toys - Small, decent addition","These are small toys that come in pieces and connect together to form the individual figures. There was some difficulty piecing the figures together, but ultimately they connected.There was no smell on the figures I received. The company was very responsive to my questions and in correcting an issue with my order.Overall, at this price a very good addition for any fans of the show or game."
2,"Useful, but dated, information","I should have noticed that the book had not been updated since 1996 (an ETERNITY in ""Web Years""). The information was useful in a general since, but I feel like I paid to much. I should have just picked it up at the library."
5,Great book.....,"Just writing to compliment you on your excellent book - Intranet Business Strategies. I picked up a copy when I was in San Francisco a few weeks ago. Right on the mark....I'm Managing Director of a Sports Photographic Agency in the UK - total staff 40 including 10 photographers travelling the world with Powerbooks, scanners and modems. The book helped crystalise my ideas - and last week spent half a day making up an Intranet myself from simple HTML pages - demos to Management Team have had brilliant response. The EMPICS IntraWEB opens on Friday ... and I'm sure it's going to be a hit.....Off to buy your Groupware book on the WWW now!!!!"
2,Good Film on a Lousy Disc,"I bought this disc because my UK (Region 2) disc is sourced from a badly damaged theater print that has the rather good Nunchaku duel removed by the Censors. I WAS hoping this US disc would have been a good replacement...wrong! this disc is so poor it makes the UK disc look as if Criterion had mastered it. Also dosen't the US have anything like the ""Trades Description Act""?Every statement on the Disc cover is false. Digitally Remastered-NO WAY, it's been sourced from a crappy vhs with faded colours and a VERY badly scratched print and 4:3 pan & scan(unlike the UK disc which is Widescreen-sort of). Dolby digital 5:1-Total Lie! At best it's only 2:0. Still the movie is probably the best bio-pic on Lee (Bruce Li really captures the spirit of the man)and it was cheap!!"
5,BRUCE LEE; THE MAN & THE MYTH,THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED WELL BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE. THE ARTWORK AND DISK WAS IN MENT CONDITION AND PLAYED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. COULD'NT BE MORE PLEASED WITH BOTH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE.
4,Worth the effort,"This one can be tricky to track down, but man it is worth it. A quirky, unexpected delight."
4,I like his blog better than this book,"posnanski is a great sports writer, probably the best I have read. I liked this book, but I actually like his blog better. He has a great way with words and definitely understands sports and why people like them and it comes through in this book."
5,A Philosophy To Live By,The Soul of Baseball illuminates what life can be. It would help anyone get past their bitterness and see that life is about what I can do today and not what happened yesterday or what will happen tomorrow.
5,More than just a great baseball book!,"This is a beautifully written book that is a thoroughly modern history of not only one amazing man (Buck O'Neil), who tirelessly reminded the world of Negro League baseball, but of Joe Posnanski's love of the game and the man. Like all great books, I was devastated when it ended. Thank you Joe. (and Buck!)"
4,Buck: Almost too good to be true,"Like many baseball followers, my admiration for Buck O'Neil can be traced to Ken Burns' documentary on baseball. How a black man could live through the era in which Buck lived with the attitudes he has is beyond me. (I am white, not American but lived in the US in the 60s and 70s.) Mr Posnanski's book is is a little too sugary, uncritical and unprobing for my liking. I cannot but help to think that with a little probing there is probably bit more to Buck's attitudes than is presented. However, if you want a feel-good book about this topic, this is the dream book."
3,A year in the life of Buck O'Neil,"I found the book very readable and never really got bored with it. I would have liked more in depth stories from when Buck played and managed. Most of the reminisces were short and sweet versions. All and all, I did enjoy the book and consider it a good book, not a great book."
5,Review,The seller went to all extremes to go above and beyond to make the sell as pleasant as possible for me! I am currently using my book to it's fullest!
1,Shipping is Terrible,"I am sure that the book itself is fine and dandy, but I cannot be sure because it still isn't here. The seller needs to get their priorities straight and realize that when someone pays EXTRA to have it delivered in 2-6 days. They (the buyer) sure as heck better get it in that time frame. Furthermore, if it is ordered from MI and going to KS, it doesn't need to visit PA on the way. I am not a geography major but I am not stupid either. When it arrives the book will probably be wonderful, but until it does I can only sit here and fume."
5,AWESOME!,"A required book for my English 122 class. It would have cost me $150 at my school but I it purchased it here for a little over $20. Arrived VERY QUICKLY! Definitely a recommended seller! GREAT CONDITION, just as it was described on the site and sold at a VERY WONDERFUL PRICE! Thanks!"
2,"ok, but pretty simplistic","The book gives an overview of a particular philosophy emphasizing constructivism in museum learning. There are some chapters of interest, although overall I was disappointed in the lack of depth or complexity of arguments and case studies. Not bad as an intro for the truly uninitiated. Anyone with any understanding of social sciences or current learning theories would probably do better elsewhere."
3,50/50,It seemed as if every other bag fully popped. Either there were very few or no unpopped kernels -- OR -- only half the bag popped.Warning: Do not eat it directly from the bag; the oil tastes disgusting. And there's very little butter flavor.
1,Returned Three Times!!!,"Three times a charm? I have owned the Krups 2100 for years and love it, which is why when needing a second espresso machine, I believed the newest Krups would be equally as good. I was blown away with the leaks around the brewing head. Also, the frothing device is extremely lame - lots of bubbles without any real froth. I called Krups and the customer serviceperson said ""We haven't had any complaints with the 2300""...Krups obviously does not pay attention to their customers. Don't buy it!"
3,Amazing Froth - Unfortunate Leaks,"I was so excited to get my Krups Novo 2300 Plus. I had tried two other brands and was disappointed. When I used the machine the first few times, it was wonderful. Great crema on the espresso and nice flavor. The automatic milk frother was wonderful! It took a bit of time to get used to the settings, but once I had it figured out it worked great. As I continued to use the machine on other occasions, I began to experience the dreaded LEAKS. I read the instructions and thought perhaps I had a dirty gasket. No. I cleaned everything and was unable to get it to stop leaking. Now it leaks on every cup. I do not try to make too much, nor do I try to make more after frothing. It just leaks. I had similar trouble with the ESE pods. I am trying to decide what to do next. I guess frothed milk sans coffee could be OK...Just kidding. Wish I had read the reviews..."
2,Not worth the extra money,"I currently have a Krups cappucino machine and I like it. I was in need of one that makes more than one cup at a time so I bought this one. I liked the fact that it shoots the froth into the cup for you. What I didn't know was that it would have a long tube hanging out of the side of it and shoot this watery milk out into the cup and all over the counter. Other than that, it's a nice machine, but if you're spending the extra money to have the special frothing, don't bother."
4,"If clean, it works like new.","Great little machine. Had all the problems with leaks etc. finally turned the thing upside down to expose the O-rings, remember the Enterprise?, cleaned off old coffee grinds, lubed them with some olive oil, and presto!! it works like new. Prefer using a microwave to heat and foam the milk, avoids the low cup-height problem."
3,"Leaky, and here is how to fix it","I ordered a Krups Novo 2300. I read all the reviews beforehand, and I read of all the leakage problems. I was hoping that the refurb would have that problem fixed.So, plugged it in, and WOW, leaked all over my counter!I tried moving the filter basket more to the right for a tighter lock, still leaked all over.So, on the suggestion of a previous review, I decided I would rather try to fix it than send it back. I went out and bought a torx wrench set.(screws are torx.)Here is what I did:1) Take out 4 Torx screws near where filter basket attaches.2) Took out 2 O-rings, cleaned everything, and flipped the O-rings around.3) Re-assembled.Now, works great. So, it seems that the O-rings are the only issue with this machine. After this repair, the machine produces a great cup of coffee. But, given that this problem of leakage is so rampant, I cannot recommend this machine."
2,Not Recommended - Novo Espresso Machine from Krups,"The Novo Espresso Machine from Krups is a poor product from what is otherwise a reputable brand.1. The unit requires a thorough cleaning after every brew. The o-ring seal is exposed to the espresso grinds which prevents an adequate seal. The unit leaks unless the seal is free of any grinds.2. The unit is designed with two spouts to allow brewing of two cups at a time. The unit does not distribute into the two cups evenly which results typically with one well brewed cup and the other a watery waste.3. I gave this product two stars only because the pod system does work as well as can be expected. There is no substitute for a properly prepared brew, ie, freshly and properly grounded espresso, properly tamped, and brewed."
2,"The ""UN-Crema"" de la creme","Bought this one for my job, whew! thank God I don't have to live with it in my home. A real let down.....Krups has lowered the bar on their normally good quality home machines. The filter holder does not seat properly in the pump head allowing the coffee to be driven out all over the place [grounds included] How much money did Krups save by cheapening the filter holder??? When the krups Novo 2000 I have in my house goes, I'll be looking elswhere for a new machine.......Oh, by the way why isn't this displayed as being available in black as well as gray???"
1,Leaks like *ELL,"Poor item leaks, do not buy!! Something so simple should not have been produced by a Krups. DID THEY TEST IT?"
1,Not worth half the money,"I exchanged the first version of this machine for a second thinking that the first was a lemon. Unfortunately, the 2nd was just as bad. The pump is not strong enough to push water through the coffee, the coffee is never hot enough and water leaks from the filter head."
1,A TERRIBLE MESS!,"Seventh Generation Liquid Dish Detergent, Lemongrass & Clementine Zest Scent, 25-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)I HAVE NEVER TRIED THIS DETERGENT, BUT THE BOX CAME TO ME SOAKED WITH SOAP...2 OF THE BOTTLES OPENED AND THERE WAS LIQUID DISH DETERGENT EVERYWHERE. IT TOOK QUITE A WHILE TO CLEAN UP THE MESS, THE WATER JUST CREATED MORE SOAP, SO I RINSED AND RINSED AND RINSED.AMAZON....PLEASE REFUND, OR SEND ME TWO NEW BOTTLES, WITH THE LIDS TAPED, PLEASESHARON"
5,There's no reason not to use it,"This product is all pros and no cons. I've been using it for the past year and just finished bottle 6 of 12. The rest I'll share with friends and family since I've just placed a second order. The detergent is gentle, effective, pleasant to use, and Earth-friendly all at the same time. There's absolutely no drawback.Amazon.com, thank you for stocking this product and supporting its sales with the subscription program. Seventh Generation has a customer for life."
5,Dishwashing Bliss,"Let's face it....who the heck can get excited about facing a sink full of dishes? But it's a whole lot easier when you use any of the Seventh Generation dishwashing products. Being plant based also creates a few unexpected benefits. It's very mild on your skin yet cleans even the greasiest pans well. It's low suddings which helps in the rinsing process. Besides, we like to think that all those bubbles are scrubbing and cleaning when we really know their not. And last but not least, since it's not petrolium based it's a whole lot easier once it enters our drains and municipal water systems. My sister lives in a more rural area and she swears by this stuff for septic systems. I was not an easy convert to this line of products, but now it's about all I ever use."
5,OUTSTANDING !!!!!,"Even if you have to buy it used, get this for your 7-10 year old to get him/her excited about this period of world history. Like all Usborne books, the simple, almost cartoonish, pictures will draw the child's interest to the equally simple and understandable text.The book covers the period of 1450-1750 and explores art and learning; science and invention; new religious ideas; war and weapons.Other topics are the Incas; the discovery of America; the Muslim empires; the Habsburgs; the Elizabethans; European settlers in North America; plantations and trading forts, the Mogul empire; life in Japan; merchants and trade; and lastly, kings and parliaments.Each topic is simply but thoroughly presented for this age group. The book provides a springboard for further learning about this period of history. A book like this will never be out of style for avid learners and for those whose interest in learning you want to encourage or increase.Even adults will learn from it!"
1,This makes no sense - just like the movie!,"This soundtrack contains songs that were not even in the movie - Why is Locomotion by Atomic Kitten even on here? Because its about a train? I can't figure it, since this song wasn't in the movie. It is a perfectly dismal soundtrack to a perfectly dismal movie. My daughter, a HUGE Thomas the Tank Engine fan, thought the movie was ""okay"" but I was amazed at how horrible it was. If you see the movie, be prepared for some bad acting an a story line that is confusing and terribly written. This soundtrack fits, I suppose."
1,The suckiest book about Guardian Angels !,"This is the suckiest book ever written about Guardian Angels. Hamilton so totally anthropomorphizes the angels to the point where the reader, instead of thinking *angels*, thinks Super Powered People and the angelic is lost. These are spiritual beings, for goodness sake! They can dance on the head of a pin! Why are you putting them in bodies with faceted ruby eyes and bi-color wings? (girl, what on earth were you smoking or were you on acid????) The book is all holier than thou preachy with all kind of human foibles foisted on the angels, and limitations as well. I'm sure Hamilton thought this was a good book when she was writing it, but an English major does not a good writer make. I had hoped to be inspired instead of disgusted. This book is kindling. I bought the book used. Apparently the person who owned it before me only got as far as the dog-eared page 28 as the ensuing pages are pristine. Can you tell I hated this book?"
4,Wear them every day,These are super tiny but look great if you have more than one whole in your ears. Great price but not for the shipping. $5 :/ I would buy them again or for some friends if it werent for the shipping.
1,not worth it,these earrings were way smaller than i expected. so i then exchanged it for the skull and crossbones earrings from sabrina silver.
1,Nothing aganist the book itself but Amazon's service is the worst.,"I bought this book on 15th July, its been over a mnth and I am still counting my days. I hope I will get this book oneday. This is my first time buying from Amazon, and thi will be my last as well. I will make sure at least my friends will not buy anythign from Amazone taht is the best I can do I guess. Seriously its not worthy buying anythign from Amazon. I wish I was buying thsi book from ebay."
2,WHAT PRACTICE TEST????,"The book/CD I received from Amazon DOES NOT contain the practice test as advertised.Per the readme file on the CD the information to access the test is either printed on a sticker on the inside back cover or on the CD itself. Bull!!! The inside back cover is BLANK and the CD has a useless MicroSoft URL on it.Of course you have to break the seal on the CD to find this out. Once the seal is broken, you can't return the book. Just lovely.Additionally, there is no information to reach MeasureUp! anywhere in the book or on the CD. The book refers you to MicroSoft's website. There you will find NO information directing you to the practice test supposedly included with the purchase of this book - only to practice tests you have to pay for.I bought this book based on the review that stated a 2003 practice test is included. Someone care to post exactly WHERE (is any test for that matter) before anyone else loses money on this???"
4,Microsoft Office Specialist - How to get certified,"The microsoft office specialist study guide provides a comprehensive look at all microsoft office programs. In addition to providing information about what microsoft office programs can perform, they also provide software that allows the user to practice microsoft office with hands on experience. Each section is incredibly detailed and somewhat intimidating. However, anyone who successfully completed a section on that office program and remembered the information would undoubtably pass the microsoft exam.This manual provides the information needed to accomplish the goal of office certification in word, excel, powerpoint, access, and outlook At times the book is a little difficult to follow due to the large amount of information provided. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this manual for anyone seeking office certification."
4,MOS Certification,Gives all the tools and skills you need to pass and successfully use the programs.
3,Love the author. The concept of putting the Office suite in one book didn't work out,"I read this whole book closely when it came out. At the end of the day, it's a bad idea to put the whole Office suite in one book. It just didn't work out. None of the separate programs is covered in depth and the book is not at all pleasing to use."
4,Great Deal,"This book has the lessons I can learn from. It has word, excel, power point, access, and outlook. All I needed to learn more of."
4,Office 2003 Study Guide,"I have not had time to study the guide and will not read study guide until late 2009. From what I can tell, this guide should help me with MOUS 2003 certification."
3,Too many errors,"In my version of the book, the practice test key and URL are on the page before the CD envelope. That's the good news.The bad news is that there are too many errors in this book. Microsoft Press should have had someone do each exercise in sequence and check that every menu item and button is exactly where this book says it is. Just as an example (page 32), you can't Autoformat an organization chart and then use Format->AutoShape to color the connecting lines red.Perhaps these errors result from new code in Office 2003, but that's no excuse. Even worse, Microsoft has not published an errata page.Finally, the author list includes no one involved in the Microsoft certification program. That may be why material in the tests is not in this book."
4,Great backup guide for intermediate/expert level MO users,"After taking extensive training in MS Excel and Access, this book covers just literally everything you would get in training and then some, but without as many examples and details.Pros - Covers all the major tests- Outlined in an easy to read format and allows you to jump around- The examples provided on the CD work very well with the text- Provides exactly the same kinds of subjects you would encounter in a more extensive trainingCons - the biggest one is that you really don't know if you are doing the examples right. Unlike the training classes, there are no ""Answers"" documents to make sure you are doing the step by step processes right. So you never really know if you are applying the concepts correctly or not.I have yet to take the practice test, so I will update this review."
5,Great step-by-step guide,I got this for a friend who doesn't know anything about computers but wanted to learn. It's an easy step-by-step guide for the beginner or novice.
5,Great Start for Beginners!,"Simple, straight forward, easy to understand and follow. The practice exercises are really helping you to master the skills of office. Better reading this book with a computer which has Office2003 on it, so that you can try it yourself once you learn something new."
4,Was worth the money.,"At first I thought the price was a little high, but once we added it to our daughters room it was worth it. It really is a nice size and I love the fact it includes all the Sesame Street members. We get lots of compliments and my daughter loved it."
5,Great CD,"Neal is a great axe man. Used to see him many years ago in san antonio when he played with ""dogman and the shepards"". Saw him a few years back with his own band. If you dig good blues give Neal a listen. He wont disappoint you."
5,LOVE IT - works great for stabilizing blood sugar,"This product is great. I have definitely noticed fewer blood sugar spikes and have better appetite control. I've only been taking it for a week now, so I looking forward to potential weight-loss effects and improved insulin sensitivity. Definitely recommend."
5,wow - take this for lower blood sugars!!!,"This product absolutely lowers blood sugars - majorly!! If you are diabetic, on meds or not, and want better control, this is amazing!"
2,Design Flaws,"The carafe is too narrow and tips over extremely easy if you set it on the counter. If the lid fit tightly it wouldn't be that big of a deal but when I knocked the carafe over, the lid came off spilling the contents.I use this thing daily to make frozen banana smoothies and need to let the bananas soften before the blender can handle them.Otherwise its decent for the price but I wouldn't buy another one."
1,biggest piece of crap in the history of crap,"I don't expect my blender to be able to crush a pile of diamonds, but it would be nice if it was strong enough to at least stir plain water. This thing is so weak, you are better off using your toes to crush the food.My other blender just broke - it used to take me less than 2 minutes to make my daily shakes. Now, with this thing, it takes at least 10 minutes, and it's frustrating because you keep having to unplug it, stir the ingredients and then start again. Not to mention that disconcerting smoking smell that everyone else complains about.Don't buy this piece of garbage - if you really want to spend $30, you are better off donating to your local childrens hospital."
4,Be sure to get the one with the glass blender jar!,"Before this one, I owned another Oster blender that had a plastic jar. It accidentally fell off the countertop and it cracked. The plastic jars also scratch easily and just aren't very durable!So be sure you get the glass jar. Also, having the extra-powerful motor is good too. I only use a couple of different speeds, so I don't think more speeds are important, however.This blender works well, however you do sometimes have to stick something in there to get the top of your concoction well-mixed in with the rest of it. But that's probably the case with most blenders.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because though the jar is dishwasher safe, you're still supposed to handwash the other parts. Blenders are great, but they're a pain to clean!"
3,Ice crushing feature not as good as older model,"I purchased this blender to replace an older Oster 10 speed model I had (changed kitchen decor). All of the features of this blender are just as wonderful as the older versions, however I was disappointed in the ice crushing feature. While this model is very powerful and performs other features perfectly, I found that when trying to crush ice, the blades would just spin and you could hear the power of this blender (i.e. getting louder) truly try to do its job. But I found it to take much longer than with the older version. Why? I am not sure but its been the case every time I've tried to make smoothies. Eventually it will crush the ice but not nearly as quickly and efficiently as it should. Other than that, this blender does perform well. Its very simple to use and the new cup design is attractive."
2,Not terrible - just not that very good,"Doesn't crush ice too well. Leaves small chunks. Stuff on the top doesn't make it down to the blade. I got this thing to make stuff like frozen margaitas, but it just doesn't blend the ice and the mix and alcohol into a smooth drink. I predict the item will hit the garbage when I find one to take it's place. I think I will give Hamelton Beach a try.Forget about this one. Not worth it regardless of price. Very disappointed."
4,Fantastic.,"I can't say enough about this release. One fantastic pop song after the other, it's truly fantastic. If you enjoy the bands made famous by él Records back in the '80s, then I think you'll really quite enjoy this disc. Obviously influenced by OMD, Pet Shop Boys, Mr. Wright, The Hepburns, etc. If you get a chance to check this out, you really should. Beautiful stuff.I patiently await his next release, which I hear is on Becalmed Records? Anyway, like I said, great stuff."
5,"A ""must listen"" for any songwriter",This is Bill Staines at his best and a must have for any songwriter. It's perhaps his most consistant album session to date and one of best albums ever made.
4,Good Collection of Primary Sources Rarely used by LDS Church.,"This is the fifth and final in a five-volume set compiled by Dan Vogel. These primary source documents can be located elsewhere. However, it is quite convenient to have them all in a multi-volume collection. These sources are those which are rarely, if ever used by the LDS Church since many, if not most of these documents raise issues regarding early LDS history. The only criticism I have is that the organization of the documents is initially a bit confusing, but works fine once the compiler's system is understood.Kay Burningham, AttorneyAuthor of ""An American Fraud: One Lawyer's Case against Mormonism."""
1,Don't do it you'll be sorrry.....,"I purchased one of these thinking it could replace the TV in our family area, it was larger than out 13"" TV, and we could also get rid of our huge 17"" Tube monitor. Well the TV picture quality is not so great, but for a monitor, while close to a tube, the resolution just isn't there, and if you have the shades open in the room it is almost impossible to see anything on the monitor, or the TV, I also was not crazy about the color of the case, there are two different colors, Black and Silver, I wish it was just one or the other, not both. Needless to say, the TV, and the huge monitor are back, I guess I will wait awhile, and hope that the image quality gets better in LCD monitors."
3,"Good monitor, Good TV IF...","This is a good monitor and works well as a TV IF you use the digital or S-Video inputs. The picture using a coaxial cable is terrible! Unless you are going to get the picture from a source of S-Video quality or higher, I would not recommend you get this for TV use."
3,Think Again about buying one,"The monitor for a computer is very nice but for the CATV it is ok. If you hook it up using coaxial then throw the monitor in the trash can or sell it on line. If you use the s-video then it gets the job done and it is ok. I will try the DVI to see if it changes anything else. When I originally bought it I figured it would support PIP, but it doesn't (costly mistake). I can't figure out why Cornea didn't drop PIP along with it. It would have made much more sense and gained much greater popularity."
1,"Warning to Foreign Language Speakers, and the Deaf.","---No PIP, (Picture in Picture) so you can work on your computer and watch the news.---No V-Chip Function, which I believe makes this monitor illegal to sell in the US, and is against FCC regulations, what this means to you the consumer.---No Tri, or Bi Lingual language support.---No Close Captioning. This, at least to me, is a big deal, I like to put the news in PIP, and turn on the close captioning, if a story interests me and I am on the phone, or listening to the radio, I can read along, if it is really interesting, I can turn the sound on. But this monitor does not support Close Captioning.Obviously if you are Deaf, and/or speaks a foreign language this is not the Unit for you."
4,"Cornea Systems CT1503 15"" LCD Flat Panel Monitor","This monitor is excellent. It's very clear and doesn't hurt your eyes. The only thing that I could think of that needs improvement is the TV tuner. It's not super clear, but it's okay. Otherwise, this monitor is excellent for the price and I would reccomend it."
3,Close but no cigar...,"Outside of the normal limitations of LCD's in general and considering the price for this 17"" monitor/tv I got what I paid for (excuse the poor syntax). But what prevented me from rating this monitor any higher than 3 stars is the fact that there were three stuck pixels and Cornea has a four bad pixel policy before considering repair/replacement of the unit. I learned this from their website as they had no responded to repeated email inquiries which I made and still have not received a response from them since February 2003. It wouldn't be so bad if the pixels were located somewhere other than near the center of the display."
4,Works fine - great price,"Fine basic monitor. Does a good job displaying text, graphics, pics, movies, etc. No doubt lots of higher resolution/more stylish monitors out there but at no where near the price. The law of diminishing returns kicks in pretty quickly for me with a commodity like a computer monitor.I've had a CTX VL-700 since 1998 with no problems at all, so I personally have had good experience with the brand."
3,Not as advertised!,"If you are considering the CTX VL700, you should know that this CRT is NOT a true ""flat screen"" monitor as it is claimed to be. The screen is convex! True, it is probably not as ""bug-eyed"" as some older CRT's, but it is definitely not flat. I'm trying to set up a dual-monitor system with my current flat-screen CRT and was hoping this model would be the perfect match. However, I find the difference between the two side-by-side monitors to be too unsettling to the eye. I'm returning the CTX VL700.To be fair, the display is quite nice--good contrast, vivid color, sharp text and images. (That's why I'm rating it with three stars.) And the price is pretty good, too. It's just not what I wanted, and I think the manufacturer and Amazon are misleading the public into believing it is a flat-screen monitor.Caveat emptor!"
1,Not what I expected,"When I looked at the picture of this model, I thought it would be a nice flat screen monitor. Imagine my surprise when it came in this huge box. I admit I don't buy or own a lot of electronics, but I was jacked. I never took it out of the box, but sent in the return notice right away. Pictures can be deceiving"
3,"A truly charming movie with, unfortunately, a non-ending.","""La Pivellina"" is a truly charming movie with, unfortunately, a non-ending. A story needs to conclude with an ending or validation of some sort to confirm for the audience that the time they spent was worthwhile. This movie doesn't do that, but it's actually worth watching despite that failure."
4,The best of chilean nu-metal,"This band is awesome, they're way better than some american bands they just dont get as much recognition as they deserve because they're hispanic but f*ck it, if you dont understand it learn some, its not hard, The lyrics are great but the music is even better, great guitar player and drummer, Arriba el Rock Hipano..."
3,"Cute cover version, but nothing outstanding","This is a very run-of-the-mill cover version of the Divinyls hit from the 90s. sorta trancy, sorta euro, sorta housey, with a high pitched, mousey female vocal. The Love to Infinity Mix is my personal favorite (in a radio edit & extended), because it has more of that funky house feel used in recent hits by Stonebridge (Put Em High) and Eric Prydz (Call on Me). You also get a radio edit and extended version of the Soda Club mixes."
4,I could not stop laughing,"I have always heard about Absolutely Fabulous but never saw an episode until today when the WHITE BOX came in the mail. After a horrible day at work I found myself howling with laughter.Yes, it is horrible and irreverent, but it is SO funny! These 2 women are so over the top that everything that is offensive is somehow forgiven.I just know it was exactly what I needed after the day I had today!"
2,"Sad, Sad, Sad","My, how far we've fallen. I remember when this show was sharp, well written and hilarious. Sadly, none of what made the original series so brilliant is on display here. What we get is a plot lifted from earlier, better episodes, secondary characters with nothing to do but make an appearance for nostalgic's sake, and a main character (Patsy) who no longer resembles herself. And it all plays out with nary a laugh in sight. How disappointing! Jennifer Saunders is an undeniable talent, but she seems determined to drag the memory of this once ground-breaking show through the dirt with these senseless ""Specials"". If you absolutely have to see this (and if you're a long time fan, you will feel like you have to), then rent it first. And be prepared to be let down."
3,Must have for a fan,"But I didn't like the bit with Nathan Lane. It just wasn't that good.It was really funny seeing what Max and Bettina did to Eddy's kitchen... ""She can't leave, you took out the stairs!""Cheers to finally seeing what happened with Saffy's marriage.mbaaaaaa :)"
2,"Some funny moments, but...","it is uneven at best. It felt a bit rushed and the humor forced at some points. Still, Eddie and Pats are two funny ladies and there are some gems to be found in the main title - Patsy's delayed surgical procedure, Bettina and Max's insane imagining of Eddie's kitchen. However, if you want to see the best bits of AbFab, watch Eddie's very funny video of a day of her life, spent with her Mom at the sad ole' Charity shop."
2,Disappointed,"As a devoted AbFab fan, I eagerly looked forward to this long awaited Christmas Special. Jennifer Saunders, being the huge talent that she is, did deliver in a few instances. I found the past lives regression scene to be terribly funny, but.... most of the show seemed to be cross between rehashing of previous jokes (Patsy's bones breaking) and a struggle to include all the cameo appearances. The WORST THING about it is toward the end when Edina struck her granddaughter. I couldn't believe what I saw. Nothing is ever funny about striking a child. In my opinion, Jennifer seriously crossed the line on that count. I can rewatch all the AbFab series and specials endlessly, except this one."
5,"Can't get any better than this! Way to go, Mom!","I'm Jill Rogoff's eldest daughter. I wanted to share with you how great she is! She has got an angelic voice! She is the one who first inspired me to make music a part of my life. Today, I sometimes sing with her on stage. As much as I love that, I never feel worthy of working with her and standing on the stage with her. She makes me proud and reminds me daily of how beautiful the best of musics can be when you hear a voice like that! Way to go, mom!"
4,Excellent instruction manual for ju-jitsu enthusiasts.....,"Earlier works by Robert Clark have suffered from the 'dark photograph' syndrome found in many martial arts books.This publication shows the improvement that can be achieved with first-class camera work and proper use of placing Tori and Uke in light and dark Gi (clothing for practise).Anyone who is making a serious attempt to improve their range of techniques for grading purposes etc. would do well to purchase this book as it is an easy reference to throws, ground techniques and finishes.I have also purchased the White to Green Belt and the Black belt publications in the same series, which are equally high quality publications.Buy these books, they are worth every penny in saving your practise time and improving your rate of progress."
2,"Bad karate, worse judo","This is not the Jujitsu I've experienced. If Clark is the grand pooba of Jujitsu in England, I'm disappointed."
4,A Brief Overview and Introduction,"Dan Cohn-Sherbok's JUDIASM: RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD offers the student of comparative religion and/or Judaism a brief overview of crucial themes in Judaic belief and practice. The work consists of approximately 100 pages of text, followed by a glossary and pronunciation guide (both of which should be enormously helpful to novices). The book's strengths include the following: a) readers are given a strong introduction to Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism; and b) a chapter on contemporary observance takes the reader through religious practices. I would submit that the book would be even more helpful had it offered a more extensive discussion of historical Judaism and textual exegesis. However, the author did not seek to write a comprehensive history; that which is presented is solid, well-written, and student-friendly."
3,This Product???,"Never received that product, got a completely different style of unit! I can rate the one I got, so far so good."
2,Noisy and Hot,"With all the noise this unit makes you'd think it had a powerful fan, but it does not, and as a result the casing gets very hot even on low heat setting. I've nearly burned myself. I'm scared of this thing on high heat setting."
1,Broke after a few months,"Lousy unit. Typically crappy Black & Decker product.First the handle snapped off. We could live without the handle, though it did vibrate and make even more noise afterward, which was a drag in the bedroom.Then the unit completely stopped working, even after great attempts to revive the patient.Black & Decker is just a front for poorly made Chinese products. They refused to take a return (they have awful customer service). I've completely had it with this company."
1,Caution lights up and heater shuts down after only a few minutes,"The way this heater is suppposed to work is you choose your room setting and then turn the heater on. And then when it reaches your desired room temperature, you turn the thermostat control towards frost watch and that will turn the unit off. It should then cycle on and off to maintain the temperature.What it actually does:It's only been on a few minutes and the tempeature reading is just 12C but the heater already shuts off and the caution light is on.Terribly disappointing product from a brand that you expect a lot from."
4,if it could be quicker...,I'd give it a 5-star if it had arrived one day earlier. The book itself is great
5,Star Product,"I am very pleased with the condition of the product, as well as, the amount of time it took to reach me. Thank you, thank you!!!!!"
4,Just what we needed.,We did not want to spend the time or the money looking for a new or used one... this is just what we needed. Thanks.
3,Cute but more of a keep sake than anything.,"I brought this bracelet as a gift for my pregnant cousin, for mother's day. I thought it was a really cute idea since, the baby hasn't been born yet. When I finally received it, it was really cute but, it's so big that I'm not sure anyone would actually wear it. It seems to be more of a keepsake then a real piece of jewelry. It's a really cute idea and but I wouldn't recommend it if you want someone to actually wear it. Might be a cute gift for a baby shower also."
3,I was bored,"I am afraid I have to diagree with other reviewers. Though the author is one of my favourites, I must say this novel was not at the same level as his other trek novels.Though the deep insight we are provided into Klingon and cardassian societies is interesting, unless you are happy with frequent references to Trek lore and don't care about a gripping story, this is not the book for you."
2,"sound is fine, but volume control is poor","I got this for my laptop, which has awful sound. The sound from this USB adapter is fine, and a big improvement over the internal sound adapter.But... the volume is way to high. I listen with headphones, so it is very uncomfortable when the volume gets wrong. I have the volume set at 3 (out of 100!) and go up to 5 in a noisy office. And that is with the application levels set very low too. Every so often some rude application makes a warning beep at high volume and just about scares me out of my skin.Get this adapter if you will use it with speakers with a volume control. Don't get this adapter to use with headphones unless they have a volume control.Get this adapter if you are deaf, or want to be deaf."
3,STARTECH ICUSBAUDIO,"This sound card was easy to install, works well.I noticed sound drop outs and phasing.Not noticeable so much when using headphones,but i use it on powered speakers.Would not recommend it for anyone looking for great sound quality."
3,Its ok,"I wanted sound in my home server. This gave me sound but its crummy quality. Buzzes in the background, not the speakers."
1,Arrived DOA,Maybe I got a bad unit but I received my item promptly and was disappointed to find out that every computer I tried it in said the device was defective and could not be recognized. The driver CD was no help and there are no drivers online.I returned it and purchased the Turtle Beach solution which cost $5 more and have been quite content with the alternative device's performance.
2,Causes ringing noise with Microsoft Lync,"Using other chat clients I had no problems, but with Microsoft Lync for some reason there was a ringing noise. Oh well."
5,Work flawlessly! Absolutely awsome!,This little device has is SO easy to use. You literally unpack it and plug it in and it's done! I didn't even need to install drivers. This works FANTASTIC for my headphones as my PC did not have a headphone jack. Now I simply plug it in with the headphones and it just works. As soon as I am done I unplug and the sound goes right back to my normal speakers.
4,Great adapter,This thing for the price has allowed me to hook my computer to various speakers and even my PA system without worrying that I might damage my sound card. Is bad when you take out the sound built onto the mother board. So far this has functioned perfectly and the ease of use was great.
2,No drivers?,"2 star rating... Shipping was literally NEXT day, However Startech is only open 8 - 6 EASTERN time if you have problems like i did... appearently the Card didn't work with my computer due to there not being ANY DRIVERS for windows to locate.. and the install on the cd did not help"
5,what is wrong with this picture??,"The single most striking fact about Communism is that despite millions of corpses and hair-raising cruelties not a single communist has ever been brought to trial for human rights violations except for some Yugoslavs who were tried for crimes they committed in the name of Nationalism. In other words, their crime was to act like Nazis. Pol Pot was never brought to trial and his unrepentant first Lieutanant was living out a comfortable retirement in Phnom Peng when last I heard him mentioned. When the Olympic Games were broadcast viewers saw a giant portrait of Mao over the entrance to the sports palace. Some of these mass murderers are still alive and if we put 1/1000th the energy into chasing them that we put into chasing down elderly Nazis there would be hundreds to try. But such trials would amount to admitting that extreme zealotry on the Left also leads to mass murder, and that can't be allowed."
1,The worst,This is the worst product I have ever purchased. The lid was difficult to open and close. My husband and I stared aghast at the huge cloud of greasy steam that was emitted from this machine when the lid was opened. I will never forget the batch of awful french fries I cooked in this appliance! Cleaning this appliance is a nightmare! It evidently has recesses in the sides and you will never get all the grease out. The painted on numbers for the temperature and the brand-name Oster wiped completely off the outside with just normal soap and water after the very 1st use! I would never recommend this product!
4,Simple and fun,"I've never owned a deep fryer before, so this was great for trying new foods and experimenting. All the removable parts make it easy to clean. I have only owned this for about a week or two, so I am dissapointed to read reviews that it falls apart within a year. Fortunately, I bought mine at best buy and got a 2 year replacement warranty for only 7.99. If anything goes wrong they will replace it. The only thing is that it takes a rather long time to reach 350 deg. temp."
4,Questionable reviews ..,"I have read the other reviews on this deep fryer. I DO agree that the basket attachment (especially the handle) is of poor construction, but I eliminated that issue by NOT USING THE BASKET. I've had my fryer since 1998 and have had NO issues other than the basket. As a matter of fact, I just made 4 trays of Moussaka over the weekend and used the fryer for the potatoes and eggplant. Heating was/is consistent and beautifully. For those having issue with steady temperature, NO liquid is going to stay at set temperature when adding items to it."
1,Don't Buy!,This the worse applicance I have ever purchased. I was please with the performance when it worked. I purchased a different model that burned out in less then one year. I returned it to the company and they replaced it with this model. It burned out in less then one year.
5,Amazing,"This EP is just flat out incredible. The chemistry between Tonedeff, PackFM, Session, and Substantial is perfect. Every song on the album is a 5/5. Extended F@mm is the future of hip hop"
5,Five star EP!!!,"This is probably the most entertaining album I've heard all year. From the halarious introduction from Squijee, to the outro, there are enough tunes and dope rhymes to keep your head bobbin for a long time.Standing out are tracks like FYIRB(Remix), Celly, How Ya Doin, Line Drop, and Velocity. Tonedeff spits some of the fastest stuff I've ever heard a rapper spit on Velocity."
5,EF@mm,"Session, Substantial, PackFM, and Tonedeff....Those 4 names should be engrained in everyones minds. 4 MCs that work together so well, you people should buy this album. NOW.If you don't buy this album for Squijee, you need to get yourself an iguana tail. (See ""Substantial Evidence"" the LP for Substantial)"
2,"Short but Sweet, Poor Visual Quality","This version of Holiday Affair is a 3 act ""play"". It is about 43 minutes in length (plus 10 minutes of extras at the end...see the end of my review). Film has very poor visual quality - dark, blurry and the film sputters once in a while. The sound is a bit scratchy too. Looks like it was taped off the TV years ago. It is a shortened version of the original movie with different actors. It is a nice Christmas / holiday story for the whole family and we will probably still watch it (or listen to it more like a radio show) each year. There are vintage commercials at the end, discussions with the stars of the movie, and an ad for a vintage upcoming show (10 minutes)."
5,brilliant,"Simply - one of the best poetry books I have ever read. Wonderful, deep, brilliant craftsmanship - stunning imagery. A great new poetic voice."
5,Farmer wisdom and experience are at the heart of this book.,Now you don't have to embarrass yourself at the coffee shop asking questions you feel you shouldn't have to ask about the basics of mechanical weed control.
1,Would not recommend,I was very disappointed in this book. I love decorating books for home decorating projects. There is not one thing in this book I would use to decorate. They show a lot of painting with stencils and other projects that I would never put in my house. Im glad I bought this used.
4,imperfectly human characters,"Elizabeth Winthrop has created imperfectly human and believable characters. From 13 year old Erin to the elderly Miss Yola, the island is inhabited by real people. This community bands together to render justice to one particular member who steps over the boundaries of acceptable island behavior. I enjoyed the climactic ending..not a shocker and not a disappointment."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book was horrible! The book description speaks of a woman returning to her summer home but the content of the book was rarely about that. Furthermore, the story of Anna Craven was cut short and disappointed me greatly. If you want a good read then I would suggest anything by Jodi Picoult."
4,Good Valentine's Gift for Men,"Although an apron designer myself, it was time for me to let Mr. wear an apron from ""another network station"". I chose this one after A LOT if searching. When it arrived, it was exactly what he was looking for. So, we both get a good review for this one. This one is your's, and I'll just keep mine here.Reporting live from the weeds of Woolley, Sidekick Sally"
2,Watch to Weigh You Down!,"This watch was entirely too heavy and bulky! I sent it back and ordered another watch. If I had looked at the weight of the product, I might have realized it before purchasing it. When my 26 year old son tried it on, it was not practical to be a pilot with this huge watch on his wrist. When we returned to Amazon to look for another watch, we compared the weights... this watch was almost 4 times as heavy as a watch we ordered to replace it."
5,Awesome,"I have been using this controller for years. I use it for all my motorcycle and other driving computer games. I bought another one not too long ago just in case something happened to my original. There is nothing else like it, smooth, easy to control and versatile. I wish I could use it on my PlayStation 3 or I wish Microsoft would come out with its equivalent for the PS3 because it blows the sixaxis controller away."
4,"""This agency stands ftat-footed......""","First the objections:-1. Sherlock Holmes has become the epitome of rational and logical thinking principally because he adhered to the statement (""No ghosts need apply"") firmly and unflinchingly. Several stories show him deviating from this principle grossly.2. The atmosphere of most of the stories were so stifling that I felt drowsy (extremely unlikely for Holmesian stories).Now the praises:-1. The authors try to open a few new portals to other dimensions in the Holmesian world.2. ""The Adventure of the Late Ourang Otang"" was fabulous.3. Most of the pastiches were well researched and good.My conclusion: enjoy it."
2,The ghosts didn't apply,"I had hoped this volume would be a combination of the best of Doyle - his Holmes stories and his horror stories. It fails to do justice to either. It's more like Ann Radcliffe writes a Holmes horror story, with everything neatly explained in the end. Only Loren Estelman's tale of Holmes and Watson facing a man claiming to be the devil really worked, Estelman left the ending in doubt as to what really took place. The essays at the end were nothing more than padding for an already slim volume."
5,Sultry...Sexy...Sweet,"I bought this album on a whim after hearing ""Raincoat"" on the radio and falling in love with it. Sometimes it is worth buying a CD even when you do not know what the songs are going to be like just because the voice makes it worth it. With this album, however, I was NOT disappointed. Every song is fantastic and I absolutely LOVE Sweet's voice. Her songs range from classical to a sexy pop sound. The only thing that does not change is the beauty in her voice. Few people could pull such an album off- but she certainly does. ""We Are One"" is my current favorite, but I love her version of Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" also as well as ""Crush"". Buy it and enjoy it over and over and over again- I am."
4,Beautiful Voice,"There are certain songs on this CD that are wonderful. ""We Are One,"" ""Raincoat,"" ""Dream On,"" and ""Crush"" are great. There are a couple that are so boring I have to skip them. Overall, I really like this CD and Ms Sweet's unique voice."
4,WORTH BUYING!,I HAVE ENJOYED THIS CD. I THINK KELLY HAS A VERY PLEASING VOICE. I LIKE A VARIETY OF MUSIC AND THIS FITS IN WITH IT ALL. WORTH EVERY PENNY.
5,Absolutely wonderful ~ a masterpiece!,"This is a wonderful cd! I first heard Ms. Sweet with the rendition of ""Dream On"" recently on the radio and just HAD to find out what this mystical, haunting voice was was all about. Everything about her voice and this cd is truly amazing and unique! I happen to love Celtic music and she has just got it with that voice of hers. I've read the reviews about various artists that she is compared to and I didn't see Sarah McLaghlan or Candace Night (Ritchie Blackmore's wife ~ Deep Purple). ""Blackmore's Night"" or ""Under a Violet Moon"" are tagged for this cd. They, of course, have Ritchie with his phenomonal guitar and voice, but Ms. Night is most wonderful with her haunting, beautiful voice. If you are really a pop/jazz listener, these cds may not be for you. Take a listen before you buy. I also don't consider Ms. Sweet pop music; I guess I really don't hear it...but whatever you want to call it ~ consider it amazingly beautiful!"
5,Awesome CD !!,I bought this CD because I liked her Raincoat song and so happy I did. I love every song in this CD and play it over and over again. I can't wait for her next CD.
4,Beautiful Voice,"Kelly Sweet has one of the most beautiful voices I've heard in a long time! As a performer, she seems to be a bit difficult to categorize, though. The music industry appears to regard Kelly as a ""classical crossover"" vocalist - sort of a female Josh Groban. But ""Raincoat"", her current adult-contemporary Top 20 hit, is bluesy pop-jazz, in the Norah Jones/Katie Melua style. No matter what you wish to call it, this is simply gorgeous music! Just an excellent debut album by an undeniably talented young artist with a very bright future. My only quibble is that I would have liked to hear one or two more faster-paced songs, just to mix up the tempos a bit more."
1,Broken upon delivery,would not play any dvds. Obviously broken and should have been tested before shipoping. it was refurbished. i didnt check it until i had driven 1 hour of a 6 hour drive. my kid screemed the entire time. amazon didnt have a replacement so they refunded my money. big disapointment.
2,Fairly Decent Movie,"This movie is not what you would exactly call a horror movie. It's a movie if your a big fan of gore and a big Lucio Fulci fan which I am. Unless you can enjoy his movies like The Beyond and Don't Torture A Duckling than you won't like this. This movie got two stars because the makeup was incredible. As was the gore. I'd give the gore and makeup a 20 star if I could. Especially the scene where Olga Karlatos gets her eye pulled into a wooden splint. It's agonizing and not for the queezy but then again thats Lucio Fulci for ya. However the plot is probably the weakest I've ever seen. So unless you want a movie full of a gore, don't buy this."
3,Leaking water,"I just bought this product from my local shopping center. Today I tried to use it. After I filled up the detergent and hot water, then put the tank onto the machine. It begins to leak water, not a little, is alot, make my kitchen floor looks like a pool. I have not yet to start the machine, it leak. I tried many times to reposition the tank, it happen again. I don't know how to correct this problem? Can anyone help me? Otherwise I will return it. Thanks"
4,Rockin' Zydeco from NYC,"After a wild and successful ride through the East Coast's club scene, this dedicated and rockin quintet breaks through with their most accessible album to date. This doesn't mean One Way Track is their best, by any means. Throw together former Mink Deville players Kenny Margolis on accordion and Boris ""Bobby"" Kinberg on percussion with the Rock Cats' Barry ""B.B."" Ryan on Guitar- add the great rhythm section of Joe ""Legs"" Geary and Joe ""Dio"" D'Astolfo, and you've got one of the greatest bands to play clubs like Lupo's, The Lone Star Cafe, and other acclaimed East Coast clubs for over two decades!Check out ""Get Lucky"", ""Feed the Snake"" and their debut on vinyl, ""Lucky 7"" for a taste of NYC's finest. From classic covers by Clifton Chenier to Doug Sahm, these guys second to no one for great rocking blues and zydeco with a NY twist. They played my wedding in 1990-and people still talk about them!!"
5,Accessible and inspiring,"This is a wonderful combination of theory and application for the creative writing classroom. Bishop helps us step away from the tired tricks of introductory writing classes and create a learning environment that's beneficial to students and teachers at all levels. She encourages teachers to position ourselves as ""senior learners"" and to implement writing exercises that make it so that every student leaves the class with the seed for a new piece of writing. Best of all, she does it in plain language that doesn't cause headaches. This isn't a classroom text, but a teaching text. Great theory, sample exercises that leave room for personalization, and a boost for my teaching inspiration."
2,Disappointment,"Several things to note here:* I am a 5'8"" woman, and the bra cups lined up too low, UNDER my breasts. I was trying to lift/stretch the piece up so I could get the cups higher, but they kept falling. Don't buy this if you are 5'8"" or taller...* I ordered a 34C size but my hips are pretty wide and it was VERY tight and VERY difficult to get this on.* It didn't do a good job of keeping my tummy in or my love handles tucked in either. And I am not fat by anyone's definition of fat. I am 140 lbs at 5'8"" and fall into the normal body weight range. with a small waist, larger breasts and a medium-to-large butt. It sucked in my waist and thighs but not my middle-section.Just some advice for anyone who has a similar body shape and/or height to me!Try Spanx?-Leila"
4,Great fit.,"I was very happy with the fit and support of this item. My only complaint was that it says it has a snap closer, which it does, but under that closure is only the overlapping slit that others have. That made it awkward to use the restroom. Great bra support for a strapless gown."
1,zara.eye,"Scene one: leggy female prisoner force w/ scant, loose fitting clothing shown during the opening credits ... the prison, the target city, and apparently the rest of the planet(s), are run by unidimentional males - go figure. I watched it as far as scene two, and just could not wait for scene three - I turned it off. I love a bad movie for the laughs, but the premise has been done to death long before, and I was afraid I'd only fall asleep."
1,A low-budget item foolishly trying to pass as something more,"After a tedious 17-minute ""set-up,"" this straight-to-video effort becomes one of those oh-so-familiar B-movies set in a post-apocalyptic world in which the beleaguered remains of civilization fight against the dark forces of ... Oh, forget it. Had this been done with a trace of style, a bit of flair, a hint of humor, it might have gotten by, despite its limited budget, but the pace is plodding, the dialog flat, and the action sequences loud rather than exciting. What's more, the movie's painfully-limited sets and woefully-undernourished ""crowd"" scenes mock its ill-advised attempt to tell an epic story. In the cast, good-girl Kate Rodger and bad-girl Katerina Brozova manage to rise above their material, but Josh Barker lacks the ""chops"" to be a he-man hero. However, it's amusing to see him hanged by the wrists so that his bare torso can be electro-shocked a la Mel Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon."""
4,Good mask,This mask is very warm but the eye holes are a little small and can interfere with vision. You need to have the right size head I guess. I am always stretching the eye holes for a better fit.
2,Way fun until......,"I got this game for christmas, i played only for a short time and i totally completed this game! i was really disapointed! the levels aren't even hard, this game is so short it ain't even funny! in my opinion don't spend your money on this! especially since at the time it was expensive!(the bad part)Well the good part is the racing is fun, and i do have to admit some levels really are fun, but once again not worth the cost, maybe if it was lowered to 5$This game is so pathetic!"
2,"FUN, UNTIL.......","Well my daughter enjoyed this game for a while but she completed it within a couple of hours, i think when i pay 40$ a game should take more time than that!I most certainly don't think you should buy this game it is a waste of money!"
2,Not impressed,"Last summer Amazon carried another organic brand that was superior to this one. Although Belle (commenter) doesn't agree, it is bland tasting and chewy. Maybe I just got a bad case, but I won't be buyng this again.I do love other Newman organic products, just not this one."
2,SunStrike,This popcorn is rather bland. I purchased it because generally I like Newman's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless. I would not buy again.
3,We always trust Paul Neuman's products.,"Have tried several Paul Newman products and have been very happy with them. This popcorn is tasty enough, but left many unpopped kernals in the bag!"
2,Not very good.,"I've had light or plain popcorn that is pretty good. This is not and I regret buying a case. Half the case is going in the garbage. The taste is blah, many of the kernels don't pop, it burns easily, and it sheds a lot of stuff that gets stick in my teeth. I will be leery of anything with this brand in the future."
2,The taste is fine...,"but is smells really weird. My daughter says it smells like Kraft Mac and Cheese powder. I think it smells bad, but the smell doesn't affect the taste. How is that, Newman's?"
2,"Used to be my favorite corn, but something changed...","We used to LOVE this popcorn. Seriously love it...2-3 bag per night consumption between my family members (x 5 days a week)...Healthy, perfectly light in salt and butter...But a few months ago, something changed.What used to be the best popcorn on the market has suddenly morphed into a mess. Besides the fact that the popcorn itself is no longer big, fluffy kernels, the biggest problem is the amount of hulls. There are so many hulls, we have to rinse our mouths out after eating...I hardly have ever even noticed hulls in popcorn before... but these are hard and there are way too many per kernels of corn. It is not just an annoyance, it really degrades the popcorn...So sad...how could they ruin a perfect product like that...?Since then, we've discovered Pop Weaver Light Butter and although it's not as good as the Old Newman's, it's five million times better than the new version!"
5,tell me what your girl wants,"Imagine fun, clever bands like Pavement or the 'Mats, but with a harder edge, and an amazingly unique singing style and delivery from lead singer Craig Finn. Lyrics that are as entertaining to listen to as the music. Get all their recordings - except for Fiestas and Fiascos - on one CD."
2,Not helpful for the game at all,"Unless you want to put this map on your wall or something, its pointless to buy it. There is an in-game version of the exact same map. Also, the map is of the entire ""world"" so it's not useful at all for actually playing the game. I'm sure it makes nice artwork if you are a big Temple of Elemental Evil fan, but don't buy it if you're wanting something to help with the game itself."
2,Retro Table,"This table is super cute, but very cheap quality. The design is terrible because the bottom is so unstable...the table could easily tip over. The top of the table scratches easily. I love the look like I said, but I wish I would have known how cheap it was before I bought it."
3,I miss read this about this product,"When I ordered this, I thought it came with the stools. The picture shows them but the description says it is just a table. I didn't realize it until Christmas Eve when I put it together for my daughter's Christmas present. I was very disappointed and she was too. I really wish that the pic had only showed the table. Now I have to go find stools for my daughter."
4,Great plot,"The plot was wonderful and interesting, and I LOVED the heroine, who was a mature, poised, cool-as-cucumber, worldly woman, not the typical annoying wide-eyed innocent girl that often populates Regencies heroines. I also loved that Frances, the heroine, was an up-and-coming painter - it made her so much more interesting. My beef lies with the hero. I feel as if he wasn't fleshed out enough, and the parts of his character that were revealed weren't all that great - his mercurial shifts of mood, his sometime thoughtlesness, his autocratic, high-handed nature. I also didn't like the fact that his explanation to Frances of what happened 17 years ago didn't include an apology - he should've gone on his knees and begged her forgiveness for the way he trifled with her then, but he didn't do that. I think this could have used a more sympathetic hero - but the heroine was absolute perfection."
5,Exactly as Pictured,"This is exactly what I was looking for. The review below says the item didn't fit a 2nd gen Nano--this is not true. My iPod is the 2G Nano that looks just like the picture (not the larger screen with the scroll wheel shifted down, but this one, with the smaller screen) and it fits perfectly into this case. I hate wearing an armband while I run, so this is great. Thanks!"
2,wrong generation,"I ordered this for a 2nd generation i pod. I really dont dig the armband cases and wanted a clip on for the belt. It was a little bulky but seemed well made. But it doesnt line up at all with the menu wheel. So if you wanted to change songs or adjust the volume, you would have to take the ipod completely out of the case and then put it back in."
5,An excellent book on our Missing Community.,"Trying to get people to work together has been proving more and more difficult. Gone is the spirit of Volunteerism in numbers adequate to accomplish things. Why do people feel connected to each other on the Web but fear talking to someone new in person? This book shows how most of the institutions and commercial entities fundamentally work to keep us apart, and how pervasive that logic has become in our daily lives. It shows clearly what core fundamental essential concepts are required for community, and how these concepts are missing from the very things reporting to bring us together. Work, Politics, The Internet, Planned Communities, and more, all pretend to be community, but are warped images of concepts we believe to represent community. An invaluable aid to anyone who is trying to help build community, by it's clear and precise look at how and why we are loosing that fight, and offers solid advice for where we should go from here."
3,Cookie cutter,"This is a big disappointment, because its exactly like competing products out there like Paint Shop Pro 7.0 and the Adobe Photo Shop. Same fuctions, same filters, effects and layer function. However this software is much cheaper than Adobe Photo Shop so that might be a good thing. The only useful function I have found that sets Fireworks apart from competing products is its integration into Macromedia Dreamweaver (an HTML editor). With such great innovations as a very easy batch editor, that lets you select whole directory and edit the size, the brightness, and file type of the output images. Very useful for people with picture websites."
3,All dried up?,"This wipes warmer is good for the concept but I don't think it delivers... The wipes tend to dry up when in the warmer, which is definitely no good. Also, if there is not an outlet near the changing area, you will have a problem."
3,"One works, one doesn't",I have 2 of these. One for upstairs and one for down. The one for upstairs is constantly drying the wipes out. The other one is just great! Probably just a fluke. Recommended product.
2,"OK, but not a favorite item.",I thought this was an absolute must but quickly realized that it wasn't a necessity like I thought. The wipes cool off very quickly after being removed from the warmer not to mention that sometimes it is hard to removed only one wipe at a time. It didn't seem to make too big of a difference to my son if the wipes were warm or cold.
5,Great Baby Warmer!,"I looked at all the reviews before choosing this warmer, and I am very pleased with it."
2,"Not a Need, just a Want","I registered and received this item as a gift and after using it a few times, i was quite disappointed. The wipes up on top almost immediately turned yellow and had dry spots.. you have to continuously add water to maintain them moist, which quite frankly to me, is a pain. They do 'warm' the wipes up but you have to take them out one by one individualy and use them immediately if not, they will chill, so what is the purpose of it then!"
3,Not THAT Bad,"The only time I've had brown wipes is when I've been out of the house all day long. My main gripe is that this wipe warmer won't fit an entire refill of wipes, which leaves me to keep the leftovers in the open bag, and that's the only problem I have with wipes drying up."
1,Beware!! Bad Smell!!,"We used this wipe warmer for about two weeks. This product did keep the wipes warm as stated. Usually the first wipe would be dry at each use and the others were fine. That was to be expected. However, what was not expected was the smell that started about two weeks after use. I walked in the room and something smelled like it was on fire. After searching I found it was coming from the wipe warmer. There was plenty of water in with the wipes but the smell was so strong I was afraid it was going to catch on fire. So we unplugged it and the smell lasted about a week or so. We finally just said ""no way"" it is too risky. I am not sure if it would have actually ever caught on fire but I would rather my little one feel a jolt of cold with a wipe than be caught in a room with a burning wipe warmer. I would not recommend the product."
4,Good Warmer,"I received this as a gift even though I did not register for it. I didn't think I needed it, but I must say that diaper changes are a much happier experience now. I didn't read the directions and have never added water. I have no problems with wet, warm wipes all the way till the last wipe. I use Huggies pop-up wipes and they work great. They seem to be thicker than pampers so I use less of them. The light is a nice feature for middle of the night changes when you want to keep baby in a slumber."
3,Still dries out some wipes,"This is my third wipe warmer - my sister had this one and had no complaints: no dry wipes, no browning, etc. So far, it seems the first few wipes are always very dry. I have two warmers - one upstairs and one downstairs so maybe I don't use the warmer often enough. My sister said she noticed a difference with different brands of wipes - I already had a big pack of a certain brand that I had to use so next time I will try a different brand to see if it does better. The only complaint I would have is the first few wipes being dry - otherwise, it is an exceptional, ""sturdy"" warmer."
3,Nice thought but,"We had to have a wipey warmer and with our first baby it was an absolute requirement, all the way until he stopped wearing diapers. The second baby did not get a single warmed wipe. This one worked pretty well."
1,Dries out your wipes after 3 months,"I really liked this for the first 3 months, but sometime around the end of month 2 the little rubber ""teeth"" holding the wipes broke off and it's now only spitting out ""wipes"" and not ""Wet wipes"". This needs to be addressed quickly. If we wanted dry wipes we'd just use a paper towel. :)"
2,Okay little gadget,"This was something that was more of a pain to load and monitor than it was an asset. I tried to use it but just gave up because it didn't warm the wipes too well, and it just seemed to take up space. I eventually gave it away."
5,Best wipey warmer out there!,"What a great product, well worth the price and the ""hassle"" of having to add water to the warmer to keep the cloths moist. This was my second warmer (Munchkin brand warmer dried out the bottom wipes quickly and turned them brown). It is so nice to know that my baby's skin is not being shocked by a cold wipey (think of how warm your groin area is and then apply a cold cloth there!), especially when you have a big mess and need a dozen wipeys to clean up. My baby used to startle or cry when I used cold wipeys, but no longer now that we own two of these in our home."
4,Made baby very happy,"Before the baby came we didn't think we would need this. This was another purchase that we made apres baby when nightime changes with cold wipes would render our son wide awake. This model does a good job and as other reviewers highlight, you do need to add additional water when adding new wipes (otherwise the wipes do tend to dry out). Pop up wipes work best (when buying refill wipes). We bought a second one for our downstairs changing area. If we are gone for an extended period of time (away for the weekend - vacation) we unplug the unit."
3,Dries the wipes out,"This particular wipes warmer really does a job in drying out the wipes. I am adding water every day to keep them moist, and I am only filling it with a half packet of wipes at a time.The Ultimate Wipes Warmer by Prince Lionheart is a slightly better product. It has a moist pad at the base which does a better job of keeping the wipes moist, and the dispenser opening is slightly more rigid so you aren't pulling 3 wipes out with every reach.I know this will come in handy as winter approaches, if I have the patience to continue using it."
4,"Love it, but don't need the nightlight","I have one of these without the nighlight. The light is just over the top. With that said, this has worked for us greatly. Some parents don't think its worth it, but our little one and us think its great. Just make sure you follow the directions and use pop-up wipes. The best deal I found for the pop-ups is the Sam's Club brand one."
5,Oster beehive blender,We love our blender. The best part is the glass container not made of plastic. Easy to wash and blends perfectly.
4,poor packaging,"This product is packaged in such a way where the plastic piece that fits into the top can be easily damaged. The first time I received this item, it was broken and I had to go through the process of exchanging it. This was a hassle, but I did end up with a quality product in the end. Even with the potential for this problem, It's a great product and worth the investment if it's on sale."
1,Poor assembly,I have been a faithful Oster Products user for several years and naturally returned for my 3rd Oster Blender. After three weeks daily use it virtually became disassembled and left some small parts on the counter and internal parts loose and rattling. It is still in warranty but will attempt my own repairs to learn if it was a design error or a simple mistake like a loose fastener. I'll give a full report in my next message.
1,I couldn't return this product fast enough.,"This was the cheapest product I have ever purchased. Piece of junk! I had an Oster product for over 30 years and it was a great product, so I ordered this blender to replace it. However, the legs on this blender are made of plastic, bent inward and don't sit evenly on a flat surface. Can't imagine what would happen if I actually put liquid in it and turned it on. Don't buy out!"
4,Solid Metal Drive!!!,"This blender is superb, it doesn't slow down... i just need the various blades. its a snap to clean just run it with some soapy water and wipe down the chrome. i gave it 4 stars because it doesn't dispense money... yet."
4,Simple to use.,Easy to use and clean. Spare parts available. Only downside is the noise. It's so loud.
1,wobble wobble,"I never even got to use this thing, after unpacking it, I set it on my counter and it just wobbled. I looked at the bottom and saw that the 4 legs were all bent, or had somehow been installed (backwards?) so that it was impossible for it to sit evenly. I must also say, although I never even got to the point of trying to actually use it, that I had concerns regarding the water tightness. The screw on plastic base did not have any kind of gasket or seal.Also, the jar did not fit easily into the base. The motor has a square peg that the jar fits over; the jar wobbled back and forth and I thought that it was not seated properly. The whole item had a cheap, shoddy feel to it."
1,LOUD!,This machine is ear-piercingly loud!!! My ears were ringing for ten minutes after I used it for 1 min (making mayo -not anything loud like ice). I'm going to send it back because I just couldn't stand the noise.
3,too loud - kids run out of kitchen screaming,"I am on amazon looking at review for a quieter blender - I have had this one for several years and love all of the accessories available, but the kids run out of the kitchen screaming it is too loud and I have to admit that my ears are ringing."
1,Total junk,I have had this unit four months. The spinning part on the base that engages with the blade in the glass container sheered off and broke when trying to crush two frozen strawberries in a fruit smoothie. What a waste of money!
2,High hopes trashed!,"We purchased this blender about 2 years ago, mainly based on price, simplicity of design and reviews from Amazon. After living with a high-maintenance Kitchen-Aid blender (all those little parts to clean!), The Oster seemed liked the answer to our blender dreams. Unfortunately after weekly use simply for smoothies, it quickly became apparent that this Oster was not like its formidable ancestors...The power is totally inadequate. Food constantly overwhelms the blade and any kind of blending totally stops. Close to its 2-year birthday, it gave up the will to live - following a weird grinding noise, smoke came from the base and then.... nothing. And now, here we are, searching for a new blender."
1,Fell apart after a few years of light use,"Exceedingly noisy, fell apart after a few years of very light use. There seems to be no way to open the unit to see what exactly broke but screws came rolling out the bottom and the guts including the fan rattle like something's loose on the inside. Other than that, the unit operates only at one speed. We knew it when we bought it and thought it would be fine given our light use of blenders but after some time found that a single speed really isn't sufficient."
1,Worst blender I've ever seen,"We used it 1 time to puree a soup and the lid would not stay on tight. Even when holding down the lid, the liquid was forced out around the lid and sprayed the entire kitchen.Too bad I bought it for my wife and took it out of the box for a couple of weeks before using it and threw the box away. Now it's not eligible for a return or refund. I guess I'll get to include it in my charitable donations list because we're not going to keep it.Junk, junk, junk! Don't waste your money..."
3,"can you say ""loud""... What? I can't hear you over the blender...","Blender looks good, but when in use sounds like a chainsaw going off in my kitchen. I was upstairs when my husband decided to make a smoothie when suddenly I heard a very, very loud whirring/grinding sound... Thought my husband was back at it with the power tools in the house again.....but NO he was just making a smoothie. He is banned from the thing early moning while I'm sleeping-he leaves for work at 5:30am. Anyway, like I said looks good, but it's ridiculously loud and needs a lot of liquid to blend correctly. Also, in our house the acoustics are very strange and we have to really yell to hear each other from one floor to the next so this Thing is LOUD!"
3,"Does the job, seriously loud","The power is great, definitely blends as needed quite well! It is really loud though!!!!! I have a wheat grinder, and I thought that was loud, but I like to leave the room when this blender is running because it hurts my ears.Also, the plastic part that screws on the bottom, and holds the blade in, broke on ours after only 6 weeks. On a positive note, Oster is sending us a replacement for free. So, good customer service.If I had it to do over, I would look for a blender that is powerful but not as loud; if one exists."
3,The best blender in the 50$ - 70$ range,"The bender over all preforms very good. I've made shakes, pastes, soups, smoothies, and vinaigrettes. It's a very simple blender with only 2 speeds and is much more reliable than variable speed blenders with allot of buttons.Goods-Blends things well for price-Easy to clean-Big glass jar (better than cheap plastics that crack over time)-2 speeds-Easy to use-Chops up ice,vegetables, and most other things-Very powerful compared to most other blendersBad-Doesn't pull items to the bottom without a good amount of liquid-The plastic bottom will leak after 2 weeks (fix it with some plumbers tape)-The rubber gasket will need to be replace more often if you dissemble it allot(soap dries out the rubber making it weak and not elastic)-Glass jar is heavy and not durable as plastic-Loud, but most blenders areOther than that a very balanced blender for the price. I could not give it more than 3 stars because of some of the quirks."
2,Worked great until it fell apart,"Bought this item on August 10th, return policy ended September 19th, completely fell apart September 22nd.The item looks great, functionality is great with on switch and burst only.But, literally, the internal organs just fell apart... A washer fell out of the vent hole and the unit's organs are just rolling around inside. Nothing was done incorrectly, the unit just literally fell apart. Since the warranty is already voided, I would have attempted to put it back together myself, but there are no external screws or the like to attempt to disassemble."
4,Very good!!!,"I used to have an old version of the same model for more than 10 years. I used it at least one time per week. I was so pleased with this blender that I bought the Oster 4093-008. It has a very powerful motor. The only problem is that it's really, really noisy."
3,NOISY! - but good,"Basic, good solid blender that handles daily smoothies well. We have been using it for a few months now with no trouble, Except, it is by far the LOUDEST blender I have ever heard. It is near twice as loud as our dearly departed 30 year old multi-speed Oster."
1,Don't use frozen fruit with this blender!,"Every morning, except when the blender is broken, I make a smoothie with soy milk and frozen fruit for breakfast. I echo the complaints of others. The all metal drive is a lie! It is rubber, and every time a piece of frozen fruit gets caught wrong in the blade the part of the blender that connects the blade to the motor shears off. I take it back, get a replacement, and before long it does it again. I would estimate that I have gone through 5 of these blenders in the last 8 months.If you plan on using your blender to blend any kind of frozen fruit, buy something else. I haven't figured out what yet, but nothing by oster."
1,a real workout-for you,"I've had this blender for several years and basically find it messy (the base either doesn't screw on tight and stuff oozes out or you put it on so tight you have to have a gorilla grip to remove it for washing.) To make the experience more ""enjoyable,"" stuff oozes out the top as the cap has a plastic piece that detaches I suppose for cleaning. But most aggravating of all is the fact that it has NO POWER and it takes major muscle (yours) and about 20 minutes (plus the burning smell) to try to make fruit smoothies with 1/2 frozen fruit. It struggles with my oatmeal cottage cheese blend, it struggles with squash soup - for crying out loud! It doesn't do a good job AT ALL of pulling the top product to the bottom for blending and that's where the unfortunate user has to mash and mash and mash the night away."
2,Fix the switch and the lid....,"I have bought two of these in the past ten years. In both cases the switch eventually failed with moderate use. While I was able to buy a aimiliar switch and get it running again, I shouldn't have to! Other reviewers comments regarding the lid are correct...it wants to pop off, especially when blending thick items like ice cream."
3,"Good, cheap but not indistructible","Have gone through 3 of these mostly making smoothies with frozen fruit. Have also gone through several other types costing much more. While the all metal connectors to the motor base helps, the actual link between the motor and the drive wheel is rubber piece with metal inserts providing threads for the screws. What happens is the rubber piece shears in half inside the motor base. I've tried replacing just this $2 part but I could never get it aligned right and it would fail right away. Decided it was cheaper to just buy a new blender and now I know I have to thaw the fruit before blending it."
1,In less that two year broke/ No duro ni dos anios,I very upset about how long this blender last.I can believe it. I should purchased a cheap one in stead of this one.
2,worked great for one year,then I experienced the same issue with the metal wearing away the plastic so that the blade would no longer turn effectively. I threw it out and ordered a different brans before I saw that there's a replacement part.
4,oster beehive blender,"first one arrived broken, however, return was simple and new one arrived quickly. it works well. only complaint is it's very loud, but blenders aren't normally too quiet!"
1,Disappointing - owned an older model,"We owned an earlier version of the beehive and it was wonderful. My wife used it to mix pancake batter and loved it. I made hundreds of batches of margaritas and it was fantastic. It eventually wore out and we replaced it with this newer model 4093 - it is horrible. It makes lots of noise, but has not lived up to its predecessor's quality nor performance. We have replaced it with something else."
3,Good,I thought this blender would be a little stronger. I bought it because i have one that is similar to this one but the other one was stronger.
3,Great blender But,I purchase this Blender and use it every day. There is something loose in the connection near the plug. I kept thinking is was my outlets and finally dawned on me. I have to keep pushing the plug hard so it will start. Should have complained before but live and learn. Other wise I would give it five stars. It does a great job
2,died after two years of very light use,"We liked the retro style and simplicity of this model - who needs 30 speeds anyway? It did fine crushing ice, making breadcrumbs, and pureeing soup. Unfortunately, after a couple of years of very light use, parts came loose inside, and because they insisted on designing the thing so that you can't open it up without special tools, we couldn't fix it and had to throw it out."
1,osterizer 2 speed,"The first time I used the blender, it literally fell apart. The motor fanblade somehow managed to unscrew itself from the motor and a nut, washer, and lockwasher fell out of the bottom of the unit. Oster customer service said that they will send a new unit to me when I give them the manufacturer code off of the prongs on the electric plug. I was impressed with the performance of the unit for the first 30 seconds that I used it. After that- not so much."
3,It's OK,"I make a lot of smoothies and blended ice drinks with my blender- basically all I use it for. I thought the Oster Classic would be a good quality blender- I've tried a few, and they all pretty much sucked- and it's OK. While it does crush up ice and mix things, it's ear-blastingly loud, and many times I have to poke something in there to get things moving, which is annoying. I may return it if I find better reviews for something in a similiar price range, or try another blade, which seems to have helped some people."
2,"Fast, but not furious","I decided to buy a blender for its dual functions: blending small batches & to make smoothies. My first smoothie with the Oster was a great hit & delish. The more I tried other recipes, the more I noticed that I prefer juices over smoothies. But this has nothing to do with the product. The other reason, my main reason, why I wanted a smaller blender/food processor is to make my own dressings. I like the size of the blender, just enough to make small - to medium batches of dressings. However, the things I don't like is the shape & noise level. High-pitched sound makes your skin crawl & the design of the blender will challenge you to get all your contence out w/o pulling your hair out. In short, I dislike it enough to only use it for dressings, but even then I ponder which product I'd rather clean afterwards my Breville food processor or this darn thing. A product I would not recommend."
3,Ok not great,"I have had this machine just under a year and a half. It performed fine, as in, i didnt have much trouble getting it to make smoothies. However, it had a burning rubber smell every time i used it - and i'd say i've used it in the range of 50 times, maybe 100 times? Not enough to strain it but way too long for it to still be burning off stuff.today the plastic ring on the bottom broke, so its useless. Hopefully the company sells that part? because while Vitamix comes with a 7 year guarantee, it costs 5 times as much .. . so last only about 4 times as long? I'd be better off buying one of these every time the last one broke.dont you miss our grandparents blenders, that lasted for decades?!"
1,"Looks pretty, blends not","While this blender may look pretty on your counter-top, that's about all it's good for. Nice retro styling from Oster but the product is useless, just like their toaster-oven. I have owned this door stop for over a year. It will only blend something that is completely liquid. Never mind smoothies or sauces, etc. I end up blending it myself with a spoon or just dealing with huge chunks. It is also extremely loud. I am still on the hunt for a good working blender at a reasonable price. This isn't it and I'll never buy another Oster product."
2,Poor Quality,"Had the blender 2 weeks. While blending a smoothie, it made a funny noise. The insides of the blender literally feel apart and a few pieces fell out oft the bottom of the blender."
1,Oster behive blender,This blender should come equipped with ear plugs! This blender was a replacement for my Oster Beehive Blender--which lasted for many years--just stopped working. This blender is so LOUD that you should probably leave the room when it is on. Recommend you pass on this item.
2,Out-of-date blender,This is a noisy blender with a jar base that is difficult to engage properly. The cost is reasonable and so are the results. Wear ear plugs or buy a better machine.
3,Just an on-off switch!?,"Warning - this item doesn't have variable speeds. It's either on or off. No dial, no buttons, just a toggle switch. I blame myself for not realizing this until after I received the unit but hopefully this review will keep others from making the same mistake. With just an on-off switch the blender isn't nearly as useful IMO."
2,Way too loud,I just wanted a simple blender but this one is way too loud. It does a good job but would not buy it again.
3,Did not live up to reviews,"This blender is beautiful to look at, and it reminds me of the one I grew up with that my mother used her whole adult life. It doesn't make smoothies any better than the old cheap one plastic one we had. I haven't tried anything else yet. I do love having a glass container over a plastic one."
1,"Nice design, poor quality","For years I owned one of the original ""beehive"" blenders and it was durable, if un-fancy. Thought the new one would be the same.Well, yes, it's very basic, which I like. NIce glass jar.But the jar never fit securely on the base, and after a few months the spindle was so worn down that the machine no longer functions. I had it maybe six months before chucking it in the trash.As I said, poor quality control."
1,"Looks good, breaks easily","Do not buy this blender! The design of it looks great but if you do not place the pitcher JUST RIGHT on the turning mechanism, it strips out the underside ratchet that turns the blade and the blender soon becomes useless. I called customer service when it broke and they just sent me another blade, I think this is a known problem and design flaw of this machine."
3,Not the blender in the picture ...,"As others posted, I ordered this blender for Christmas. What I received is not the blender with the multiple speeds in the picture, but rather a more simple blender with a switch that toggles between one speed and a pulse option. So the blender I received seems more limited in its utility, though its overall look and design is basically the same. Seems to work fine for smoothies and shakes, etc. I like it so far! But if multiple speeds matter to you, then beware ..."
4,Good for what I brought it for.,"I bought this product based on reviews that I have read, and I can say I was pleased. I brought this product mainly for smoothies and making homemade baby food for my daughter. If you follow the instruction it works great. Easy to clean and use. The Two speeds work well for what I use it for. If you are doing simple things then this product is for you."
4,"Great blender, good price","This blender is very good for a variety of tasks. I love the fact that it is replacement for one of their blenders that lasted for 30+ years. They make the blender assembly from metal, so it lasts forever or almost forever. Plus it is simple to operate and clean."
3,Duck!,"While this is obviously a quality product, it has only two speeds: 1) really fast and 2) screaming!On ""really fast"" you must hold down the toggle switch; ""screaming"" locks and holds itself.Starting on either speed, you'd best duck or have the cap on because anything in the canister will end up on you and the ceiling otherwise.Blender research has obviously dictated a slight redesign of blade shape; the tip of one side of the upper blade set is bent upward which breaks up ice much quicker. A good feature.What would make this a 5 Star blender would be a (much) slower speed option. Or two. As it is I give it only 3 Stars."
4,"Good, but...","I've been using this a lot since I am on a mostly liquid diet. I bought the milkshake blade, as well, which works best for shakes.Pros: I like the sturdy, heavy glass Jar.Pulse and fast are really all you need for speeds.Cons: It leaks out of the two notches on the top that are for inserting the clear plastic top.The jar has come unscrewed from the jar's base while running."
4,Great Product,Great blender - especially for the price. Makes great frozen drinks and looks nice sitting on my kitchen counter. Would recommend.
1,Doesn't last very long before falling apart,I've bought 2 of these blenders now and both within the span of a month had something come loose in the Beehive housing creating a loud clanging noise. I picked up the blender and looked underneath the last one and could clearly see a loose bolt. There was no way to unscrew the bottom to try to fix it so it had to be returned like the last one. I had a Oster Beehive blender that lasted for years but it was either a different model or their quality control has gone seriously downhill.
4,Blender Review,The product has been purchased for use in a manufacturing company. We used it to grind dried meat products to enable us to determine the water activity in the meat. This blender is used at least 60 times per day 7 days per week to undertake this operation. The blender has been found to last the longest under the amount of work it has to perform. We go through approx 8 or these blenders per year. They are disposed of once at the end of their life (6-7 weeks)
2,Not what it used to be,"Bought this to replace an Oster Classic that served me well over 6 years, making smoothies 4-5 times a week. This new one was noticably different in quality right out of the box -- blender body is plastic disguised as metal, which might explain why it was so much noisier than my old one -- and the motor has now burned out just 6 months after purchasing."
2,Disappointing,"Bought this for my wife about 7 months ago. She likes to make smoothies and margaritas and the reviews sounded like this might be good for that. Retro design was ok; extremely noisy like most reviews have already mentioned. The biggest disappointment was that with just the single small blades at the bottom, the blends tend to get stuck blending within a small radius of the tiny blades and the rest doesn't move. You end up stopping the blending, manually stirring and starting up again. Our friends bought us a Ninja(?) blender as a gift and wow, what a difference those multiple blades make. No more blending just in bottom of the blender. We now have 2 blenders and I'll let you guess which one never gets used."
2,An unfortunate waste of money,"I thought a $70 blender would not only blend better than cheaper models, but certainly last longer. I've had this for 6 months, and the end cap that attaches to the bottom with the blade has cracked TWICE in exactly the same place, leaving me a bunch of slop to clean up all over my kitchen. I only use the blender 2 or 3/wk for smoothies WITHOUT ICE, so it's not as though I've put it through a heavy workload. Very unfortunate, because it does blend well. Now I will NEVER buy another Oster blender, nor will I ever recommend them."
2,cheap plastic base,"I had an Oster Blender that worked great for 30 years. When it died, I thought I could do no wrong in purchasing another Oster brand. I purchased the beehive for its 500/600 watt ice crushing/smoothie making ability. $56.00 is a little pricey and I thought I was purchasing a good quality item. The glass jar and the chrome base seem to be good quality materials. However, the blender jar base(part that holds blade/rubber ring) is of very thin cheap plastic. It broke after just a few uses. Of course the store would not take it back after 60 days.Luckily I had not thrown out the old Oster blender. I took the old glass jar base (good heavy plastic)and it fit the new Oster.Another problem with this blender: The plastic part on the chrome base that holds the jar base is also of cheap thin plastic. Cheap plastic attached to a heavy chrome base doesn't make good engineering sense to me. I keep waiting for it to break.Come on, Oster, put good quality materials into your products!!!!"
5,Great blender!,Very sleek and modern looking. Looks great in our kitchen along with all our other stainless steel appliances. Works really well and makes great smoothies.
3,Oster has cheapened their product a little.,"If you are replacing an Oster Blender from the past, you may be a little disapointed. I think they have taken out some of the weight, strength, and durability. Nice glass cup, and functions the same as before. Only time will tell if this is a fair evaluation."
4,Osterizer,"the Oster classic beehive is classic in superficial appearance. However the motor is now a plastic encased gizmo, plenty strong enough and probably more efficient than the original. The beehive base is a disappointment because it is lightweight plastic, doh! The original I grew up with has a heavy cast base, probably a lethal weapon by today's standards. the chrome look turns out to bee tacky since it's really plastic, but it does osterize in a satisfying manner."
5,Good retro-styled blender,I've been quite happy with my new blender. I was a little taken aback with the tower-of-chrome-power appearance when I first opened the package. I bought it sight unseen based on reviews I read on the net.My most demanding task for the blender is puree-ing beef liver for dog treats that I make for Sophie the dog. My old blender died with a wisp of smoke in this task. The tower-of-chrome-power seems to handle this effortlessly. Its easy to clean. And sits imposingly on top of my refrigerator when not in use.Good buy!
1,It is still running but...,"In the process of searching for a blender that functions properly, I came across the Oster 4093 Classic Beehive Blender. We have had this model several years.It still runs.It's still REALLY LOUD, to the point hearing protection should be used.It still creates an air bubble, immediately, which prevents it from blending anything.So, it's noisey and doesn't blend but, it looks nice."
3,"It's alright, but.....","This machine works great, but the part that screws on and holds the blades broke after one use. I haven't been able to replace the part because you have to take it to a service center, and there isn't one in my town. But, they still won't replace it over the phone. I haven't been able to find anywhere to even BUY that part. So right now, it's useless."
1,"Where are ""zero"" stars when you need them??","I recieved this blender as a gift. I had an Oster blender much like this one for about 30 years, until the glass pitcher broke. My husband replaced it with this newer model which is by far a lesser quality from my original. I've hated it ever since and am now ready to toss it. Forget the fact that it is the noisiest blender I've ever had, and that there are only two speeds--fast and faster, the biggest problem is the cheap, black plastic ring which the pitcher fits into has now broken for the second time. The first one broke within two weeks of owning the blender. I contacted Oster and they sent out a new one at no charge as a ""favor""--a one time offer. To me that states they do not stand behind this product, knowing they would be replacing the cheap plastic ring over and over again. I'll never get another Oster product."
1,Couldn't Handle Frozen Fruit,This blender works fine with fresh fruit and ice cream/yogurt but broke a month after I started using it daily to make smoothies with frozen fruit chunks and berries. The device in the bottom that spins under the blades snapped right off. Now this blender is useless. The blender also got stuck constantly and I'd need to scrape the sides and stir it and restart it. Now it's back to searching for a stronger blender.
3,Metal parts strip too quickly,"After using this blender for a year the metal center of the agitator blades was stripped rendering the blades useless.I bought new blades and within a month the part of the motor that fit inside the agitator blades was stripped rendering the motor base useless. I loved the performance of crushing ice and making extra smooth smoothies, but the metal parts wore down way too fast."
1,Plastic base to jar cracked,"I've only used this blender a handful of times since purchasing it in 2009, and I usually hand-wash it rather than put it thru the dishwasher. But the black screw-on base to the blender jar has already cracked (in three places) - completely unusable."
1,It does not have an all metal shaft,"It does not have an all metal shaft, it includes a rubber drive coupling.Rubber drive coupling for Oster blenders & Kitchen Centers.This ripped in half after about a year and the replacements have last a few months. I mostly use the blender for making protein shakes with yogurt and frozen fruit. It is very frustrating to have the blender unusable every few months."
1,Cheap Imitation of the Original,"In the past I owned this Classic Oster, although the base was stainless steel and it lasted (literally!) 30 years! The motor never wore out, instead, what made me have to give up on it was that the shaft on the base got loose and would not turn anymore.So when I purchased this look-alike at Sam's I was confident that I made the right choice. WRONG. I used it for less than a month, and the blade will no longer turn because plastic teeth on the cap are shot, because of the cheap plastic they used. It no longer has any teeth to hold the shaft in place! I was so irked to learn that Oster had such shoddy parts now, I went out and bought myself a nice Hamilton Beach and its been a dream now for more than 6 months! Too bad, Oster is no longer on my go-to list. I wish I would have perused the feedback here first, from now on I will, even if I buy elsewhere!"
4,excellent but NOISY,"this blender is heavy-duty and powerful and my only complaint is the noise. I have to cover my ears when I use it but it only takes up to 30 seconds to crush 6 ice cubes for my smoothies when my old one left big chunks of ice no matter how long I had it running. I recommend this blender above all others because it's sturdy, strong, and relatively small compared with other blenders in the same power range. buy this one and you will love it!"
3,Too Noisy,I shuld ave listened to the other rreviews....this thing is just tooo noisy....evrything else is fine...except that when you turn this on it is too loud...
4,Step 1. Buy blender...Step 2. Buy earplugs...Step 3. Make tasty Drink,"FWIW I actually don't have this model, I have a 600 watt model (""1000 Osterizing watts"" - don't be fooled by their marketing gimmicks) perhaps only for the Canadian market? I dunno...I can't find it on Amazon. However, I did a lot of research on these blenders on various bodybuilding forums and many people have this particular blender and highly recommend it. It should pulverize your frozen fruit and ice, multiple times per day, for years to come. From what I've read 500 watts will do the job just fine, but don't cheap out and get the $30 low-wattage blender, because it won't last. Set your bottom at 500 watts and buy with confidence. Oster blenders are good stuff.The only problem is it sounds like a freakin jet engine. Take away one star for the hearing damage you will likely incur. It literally makes you cringe a little bit every time it's on and you might just wake the neighbours if you use it past 11pm ;)"
2,Strong but messy,"I bought this to replace my Braun blender, which died after a mere two years of use. Despite the outstanding reviews the Oster received, I would not recommend it. Yes, it is strong - too strong. If you put more than 1 cup of liquid in there, it goes all over the kitchen - and that is despite forcefully holding down the lid during the blending process. Blending a huge pot of soup one cup at a time is not fun.On the other hand, it did an outstanding job with pesto - better than the Braun. On pulse, it does a nice job of sucking everything down into the blades. I don't have to constantly stop and stir.Unfortunately, I make soup far more often than I make pesto. So while I will not be getting rid of this until it dies, I will be cleaning up my kitchen far more than I had anticipated."
4,A Perfectly Good Blender for the Price,"What can you say about a blender?Pros: Easy to clean, attractive, very powerfulCons: LOUD. The lid doesn't fit well."
2,It does the job but the plastic smell sucks,"The outlook really makes you think this is some cheapy machine. What's worse, the plastic cap emits the smell as most low quality plastic does, which makes me doubt whether it is harmful to my health.The blade is powerful and does the work."
2,Loud and ineffective,This blender has not worked for making sauces or soup. It will only blend the material at the very bottom. It's also extremely loud.
2,TOO LOUD,This blender is fine overall in that it blends. But it is way too loud. Its awful. There are better blenders out there.
4,not just for blending beehives,"A good blender for a variety of different blending options. While most other blenders only have one option ( blend) this blender has many different buttons to choose from. The transparent holder is a vast improvement over their model with black electrical tape wrapped around the interior. For one you could not see what you were blending, secondly little bits of the tape would end up in everything you made, and thirdly you always had to get more tape, like every two weeks. in this model the tape is optional and goes on the outside if you prefer not to see what you are blending. As well, the tape is only 1 inch in width, unlike the 10 inch width tape, what a nightmare. kudos to oster for fixing all of the flaws of the previous model."
2,Somewhat disappointed!!!!,"Bought the blender without checking the power outage, since the item is available worldwide I took it for granted that it would be suitable for Australia's power supply, but unfortunately it's not! we run on 240watts with angled flat pin plugs, the unit is wired for 110watts with a round pin plug. Consequently I haven't been able to use it! I purchased this particular blender because we had one that we bought here in Australia and it recently gave up the ghost after 5 good years service so I thought I'd get another BUT I've got to say that the one we had was much better, it was more solid, better finished and had two speeds including a pulse mode. Overall shopping experience very disappointing not to mention an expensive learning experience as well.Can't really rate it as I haven't used it!!!"
1,"Not ""All Metal Drive""",The rubber/plastic base of the drive broke in two. This blender does not truly have an all metal drive system.
2,disappointed,"I bought this because I have always had an ""Osterizer."" I inherited my grandmother's from the 60's and it still works. I needed another since I now have a country house and a city apt. I have always liked the fact that it had only an on/off switch since I could never understand why blenders came with 8 buttons that did nothing more than make the machine go faster or slower no matter what they called it (puree, blend, whip, etc.).The new one is cheaply made and VERY noisy. The old machines were made with a metal screw cap on bottom while the new ones are plastic. The plastic bottom screw cap cracked within three weeks as I tried to tighten it before use. I had to order a new one on-line but still could not find a metal replacement.The glass pitcher wobbles no matter how I place it.I am so sad since Oster was a sentimental favorite."
3,"Good consistency, but sooo loud!","This blender has a lot of pluses:-Good Looks-Glass Jar-500W Motor-Single Speed Operation with pulse option (never really used the other speeds of other blenders anyways)-Blends/Purees to a very smooth consistency, good blade designThe bad include:-Noise, wow this thing is loud. It's ""thinking about putting in ear plugs before I turn it on"" sort of loud.-Cleaning, it is extremely dangerous to try and clean the jar without disassembling first, those blades will get you.Overall, I'm satisfied with it, but because of the noise I would not buy it again or recommend it to friends."
5,Power!,"We've had this blender for ~ 4years now. Our first blender was also an Osterizer - which we had for about 20 years. It was also the basic kind - on/off/pulse. We bought both for the power and no plastic parts.We regularly put in a can of frozen orange juice concentrate, 1/2 can of water and 1 and 1/2 cans of crushed ice. [The crushed ice comes from a refrigerator crusher - so there's lot's of big pieces.]Turn it on and let 'er rip. The mixture is so thick that we have to take the glass container off and push down the ice that is still on the top. One more pass and it's all one very thick, frozen, dry slush. I.e., it stands up when dropped from a spoon.Only issue is that the ice crusher blade begins to leak after a couple years. Since it's an $8 replacement item, no big issue."
1,Extremely Poor Warranty Service,"This Oster blender broke in less than 3 months. I then had to send it to an independent repair center for evaluation, at my expense, and they promptly declared the blender unfixable. I was told a new blender would be sent within 2 weeks. It is now 4 weeks later and I have not received a replacement blender yet. I have attempted to contact Oster directly and no one has responded to my complaints. My only option is to continue my communications regarding the warranty through the independent appliance repair center. I question ""what good is a one year warranty?"" if Oster won't deal with replacements in a timely manner."
1,parts flying off the base,"I bought this blender because of the glowing reviews. I thought I would splurge on a pricier blender, after having my $14 blender die after 3 weeks. Though it looks sturdy, this blender DIED on its first job. I assembled the jar, put the liquids first, then some frozen fruit and press the pulse button. After a few seconds I hear metal falling. Out of the bottom vents of the blender's base I see washers that flew out of the inside of the blender. There is a piece of metal now loose inside the base and, of course, the blender does not work. This baby is going back ASAP! And I am getting a refund. I think I am done with all blenders for now..."
4,simple and elegant,"This blender is very simple, but perfect for everyday non-commercial use. It isn't fancy, but the design is elegant and has a retro feel to it. I did have a little problem the first time I used it because it started to leak. Then I realized that it wasn't screwed in all the way. Be careful of this the first time you use it. I kind of jumped right in without checking it out too much and the base is easily separated. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the assembly before using."
2,LOUD LOUD LOUD!!!,"I have used a much older Beehive style Oster blender and it was strong and quiet. This one is unacceptably LOUD for indoor use. It is as loud as an electric chainsaw. It would definitly wake up anyone sleeping in our household. The motor seems powerful and the blades sharp.Update. 28 Dec 2010Found a better blender on Amazon, less than half the price, slightly less loud, but with 8 speeds instead of 2 you can have more control over the volume. Costco has them in all colors including chrome. With a plastic base similar to the beehive style. Oster BLSTMG-W 6-Cup Glass Jar 8-Speed Blender, White."
1,Motor fell apart in less than one year,Am extremely disappointed in this product. The motor fell apart in less than one year. I picked the base up and you can hear the pieces moving around.
2,Save yourself the grief!,"My old blender died and when I mentioned it to a family member, they offered me this one. They were buying a Blendtec and didn't need it anymore. Ever heard the phrase 'you get what you pay for' ? Well, it certainly applies here! I would really be frustrated if I bought this blender. It's cute, no doubt. And if you just want a blender that looks good, with it's retro styling, go for it. But it is noisy and doesn't blend well and can't handle anything very thick. I am getting a Blendtec and SOON!"
3,Noisy! Always has greenish grey junk coming from blade,I've had this blender for at least 3 years & it still works ok but noisy! Always has greenish grey junk coming out blade bottom. At 1st I thought it was grease coming from the turning mechanism of the blade. Probably just rotten juice that is impossible to clean out. I hope this junk is not in my smoothies. Is this the case for all blenders? I want a good one.
5,Traditional Oster Blender that does the job,"I had one of these Oster Blenders in the past that seemed to have lasted forever. I just got around to getting a new one. The model 4093 has the traditional squared shaped glass jar. It has plenty of power for almost any job that I have used it for. I like smoothie's, shakes, drink mixes and it has no problem crushing ice as needed. You can't go wrong with this blender and it is definitely worth the price.I previously owned a black and decker that leaked at the base of the blade assembly due to poor design. This is definitely one of those things that you get what you pay for. So don't let the price hold you back on getting great quality that could very well be the last blender you will ever buy."
5,"Actually, 4 and a half stars....","A great blender, powerful motor, easy to disassemble to clean, and well built. The only downside, I wish it were 6 cups instead of 5.... a piddley complaint!"
4,"Simple, Solid, Powerful","The blender has worked quite well. It's simple, powerful and kind of old fashioned looking. The ""beehive"" base is cute and kind of retro looking. Who would think in the year 2012 you could buy such a basic, elemental product.The heavy glass jar can be pre-chilled in the freezer and helps to keep my fruit blends oool and refreshing.It's loud as heck, but you don't have to run it that long to get the job done. I wish the clear plastic cap was a bit easier to insert into the matching rubber cover.Oster should be proud of this product and I hope they keep selling it until eternity."
4,great blender,"Many of the other reviews said that this is a loud blender - and it is. I am used to it now and noise does not bother me that much. I have only had it for a short time but have had no problems. I use it to make smoothies with frozen fruit and they are perfect every time. I made a mistake and did not tighten the bottom at all before mixing one day and when I picked it up, there was smoothie everywhere! Cleanup was very easy because of the design. It is all sort of molded as one piece and I did not have to get smoothie out of lots of tiny crevices. I'm happy with it so far."
2,Not needing to be found,"2 1/2Works best for those already into the group. It's not a terrible collection of non-album tracks, just not a very good one either."
4,The Transition Record,"Recorded after Ring Wars and before Mare Vitalis. This is a transitional record that explains alot of how they developed the more raw melodic feel of Mare Vitalis from the raw atmosphere of Ring Wars. This is a short but sweet record, Appleseed Cast fans need only apply here. Their are some very interesting riffs that only AC could come up with, and some realy great vocals from chris. The only thing is their are two tracks that sound like alot of statis with SOME (very little) melody in them, I don't know why you'd release a record and slow it down with subtle instrumental tracks, but that's sorta been their thing (especially in LLO). It's still better than most records but by no means is it a complete album. It's a great gift to fans who crave more music from this very talented band. Look for a new release this year, and if your new to them check out Ring Wars, Mare Vitalis, and their masterpiece Low Level Owl I & II."
5,"Oh, come on......","Oh, come on Californian music fan, you can't be hearing the same cd i've been listening to for the last 6 months. This cd easily matches Copper Blue and beats the somewhat leaden Black Sheets Of Rain hands down. Moving Trucks, Who was Around and Skintrade are classic Mould tunes. Its so good to hear him having fun after the dour, harsh soundscapes of the 'hubcap' cd and the way Moving Trucks shifts up a gear for the insistent refrain at the end reminds me why Bob Mould is my all-time favourite songwriter/performer. Hopefully his plans to go down a more acoustic road in the future will bring us another masterpiece like Workbook but in the interim this will do just fine."
3,3....brilliant songs,"This CD starts with a bang. ""New #1"" is a thumper of an acoustic catharsis track and ""Moving Trucks"" bristles with the same energy of days of lore. It gets lifted one last time with ""Reflecting Pool"". Everything else runs together.Pick it up though....those tracks will leave you slackjawed."
4,"Bob, Thanks for the show!","The reviews of this one are all over the map. I think this is a strong album from Bob. He has done about all one can do in his art-form, which is, heavy folk-rock (sorta). ""Workbook"" was my introduction to his work and I have enjoyed all but the previous, ""hubcap"" album. I have been impressed with his ability to remain ""Bob Mould the musician's musician"". His popularity is relatively low, but he is always there, performing and writing with skill and grace. Sure this album is not ""new"" but as he goes on to his next ""thing"" he leaves an album that nicely summarizes his contribution to no-pop, non-commerciallized, loud (well recorded), emotionally-charged music, period."
1,Disappointing,Bob does not go anywhere new with this album. He should have quit before The Last Dog and Pony Show.
1,My God Bob what have you done!,"Pick up ""workbook"" or ""black sheets of rain"" or sugars""copper blue"". This sounds like a man who has lost all creativity. There for if your a dave matthews fan or perhaps everclear you might like this. Anyone who has tastes pick up the albums I all ready mentioned and pray that Bob snaps out of it."
5,Bob Mould is one of America's best songwriters,The Last Dog & Pony Show is my absolute favorite Bob Mould solo work. The lyrics are thoughtful and project an image and a story in my mind. The guitar riffs are solid and the arrangment is excellent. Just put this in your CD player in your car and go out for a drive on a sunny day. Audio bliss!
3,"Nothing new here, but a few good songs","Bob Mould is one of the best songwriters I have ever listened to, but this CD is one of his most mediocre pieces of work. There are some wonderful songs (""Reflecting Pool"", ""Moving Trucks"", ""Vaporub"") but some uncreative pieces as well (""Taking Everything"", ""First Drag of the Day""). All in all, not bad but not great either. Pick up his self-titled solo album or ""Black Sheets of Rain""."
2,Not sure about this one!,"Well it is interesting to see the diversity in the other reviews. From one star to five. I really don't detect much Husker on this album. It's got the trademark elements of Sugar and solo Bob; layered guitar, layered vocals, layered everything else, but it falls short of his great work. No new ground being explored here, even Mega is cliche trip-hop. Although it functions satisfactorily as ear candy."
3,Worked at first...2nd one works great!!,"Update: August 13, 2008. New griddle (2nd one) works great. My step-daughter has not had any problems with this one. She loves that she can cook many things at one time. This is just the perfect size for her family of 5. She loves pancakes and this was just the right gift for her. Hopefully, this one will keep working. I would now give this griddle 5 Stars...Ordered this for my step-daughter. She loved it until it decided to stop working. We are sending the defective one back and are waiting for the new one to arrive. Hopefully, there will be no issues with it. Waiting to see if all goes well and then will change this review to 5 stars."
2,Sending this one back,"I was not pleased with this griddle at all. After reading the positive reviews, I ordered it. Maybe mine was defective, but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when I flipped them. It did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher. Oh well. Can't win them all!"
5,All purpose grill pan,"I ordered thi electric pan for my friend's birthday. We used this pan many times for cooking. It works very well.You can cook anything you want. By the way, it's easy to clean up. It isn't expensive at all."
3,The Griddle is Ok...but....,"The non-stick surface seems to be really good...much better than on the previous griddle I had. However...I am not exactly thrilled with the heating. There seems to be a lot of overshoot when it first heats up. It takes about 15 minutes for it to settle down. Also, it does not heat as evenly as I would like. Although, it is much better than the previous griddle. I have used better in the past...I have used worse."
3,Slightly disappointed,Clear and safe instructions. The DVD was not as heavily focused on the core as I had expected and was more of a general and basic yoga workout.
5,this album stays with you!,"i bought the new albun in blue without hesitation,i knew that it would be good i had heard breathless and loved it so i thought anything like that quality and the album would be a sure success.it is true to say the album is more pop orientated but every song is different and appealing and its an excellent album from start to finish i particularly love somebody for someone and one night. and i find myself after having the album a month still listening to it its addictive.i also love the album because it means something very special between a certain somebody and myself.they know who that person is.its quite an album for the romantic at heart and i recommend it to anybody."
3,"Nice DVD, but not a must have","After reading the reviews and looking at the song list, I had high hopes for this disc. The picture quality was good and Ray's energy as he bounced onto the staged was also promising. However, from the very first song, the recording is a disappointment. In the first song, the audio mix is so far off that you can't even hear his piano. This is eventually corrected, but throughout the performance we all felt that it was a bit hollow - lots of surface flash, but none of the true depth of soul for which Ray Charles is legendary."
3,Ray Charles at his best,"Always good to see Ray Charles perform to a live audience. As this was crudely recorded at the time, its quality is not up to contemporary standards, but good for historical feel that captured the performance on the occasion."
4,"Maybe Not The Greatest Fante, But Still Good","While I do recommend this collection, I can't give The Big Hunger five stars only because I love Fante and have read all of his published work, and these stories are not his best work, which can be transcendent. I wouldn't want anyone to buy this collection imagining this is a good place to start with this author. Of course, if you also are a Fante fan, you'll want to read this and you won't be disappointed, as long as you accept it as a collection of miscellaneous pieces. But they are unmistakably, recognizably Fante, and I'm grateful for any scrap I can get. Moreover, there are some very, very good pieces here. The prologue to Ask the Dust, for example, is stunning, and several of the stories are on a par with those published elsewhere."
4,Very interesting...,"Spider-Woman was a different and daring book for the time it was originally published (late 70s). If you're looking for a female version of Spider-Man, look somewhere else. This book is edgy and shows a character who's not comfortable with her super-powers and really isn't that powerful overall. Jessica Drew has a unique problem; her spider-blood makes others not like her. This plays out for awhile before Michael Fleisher takes over as writer and takes her in a new direction. There aren't a lot of big-time villains outside of Hydra in the beginning parts, but it's an eclectic group for an eclectic heroine. If you're looking for a different look at heroes, here's a good read."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Some good, solid superhero tale, with a solid female lead trying to make her way in the world after an terrorist and espionage ridden upbringing. Given the time it is not quite Sex and the City, and she does have a kindly avuncular figure around, who happens to be a magician, and of course her landlady is not what she seems."
4,looking for info on Metallica? look no further!,"The Complete Guide is a must for any Metallica fan. This book tells the story of Metallica from the time they started up as a garage band, and up until the Load release. This book will tell you the answers to every question you may have about Metallica. The only reason this book did not get all 5 stars, is that in certain cases, the author tends to over dramatise the songs. I have read this book throug, and it has extendet my own knowlege of the band quite a bit. I can definitely recomend this book to all Metallica fans. If you havent read this book yet, then get started now or miss out on a huge part of the history of Metallica."
3,Not so Great Building documentation,Dont't buy this book unless you are looking for low resolution images and minimal information. Is a start as a building index but you're better off with a good book. Expensive and I regret my purchase.
5,LOVE OM Yoga!,"I have had many yoga books and CDs over the past 7 years, and the OM series is the best. Easy to use and to understand, and the colorful drawings are a nice break from the boring black and white photos of skinny people in leotards!"
2,"Great Practice Sessions, Poor Visuals","I agree with most everyone here, this book is great! It has several daily yoga sessions you can practice, according to time and what you need for that day. The notations and instructions on each pose is direct and clear. I felt the only down side of the book was the illustrations. They have stick figure people demonstrating the poses, and it does not clearly illustrate the detail of the human body. I felt the visual demonstrations were as equally important as the detail of the written instruction, especially for me as a beginner. I wish I could have given it a higher rating because the rest of the content was great."
4,i love yoga,"It's a great book for different yoga sequences. It gives directions for each sequence with figures, but it does not talk anything about a particular pose- the benefits or the contraindications. Not ideal for total beginners, but good if you already know something about yoga."
4,Good directions,"So far I've only done the 5 and 15 minute routines. I like it a lot though, there are nice little stick figures to follow and then more detailed directions and drawings a few pages after if you don't know exactly what to do. So far I am very happy with this book!"
5,Fabulous!!,"This is my 2nd yoga guide by Cyndi Lee. Perfect instruction for my life. I highly recommend this book to people who have the yoga basics already. I am no yoga expert, but do know enough to have this guide be essential to my practice."
1,I Agree with Mr.opposite,"In my first attempt applying the ""system"" found in the book, it wasn't long before I was at the house limit and down plenty. 19 spins in a row and no 2nd dozen. I do agree that the odds of this happening would be considered long, but I rode it thru the 13th spin, took my beating, and waited to see how long it took until a 2nd dozen came. 19 spins=Broke."
1,Same Old Martingale!,"I had high hopes after reading the description for this book. I purchased it and was immediately disappointed about 10 pages in. The first half of the book is nothing but hype and fluff. The author goes on about how he's made so much money with his system, then wastes 5-10 pages explaining the odds of each bet in Roulette? Give me a break! I thought this was suppose to be ""Roulette Secrets"" not ""Roulette 101."" When he finally got to the system, I was floored. He basically wants you to use the Martingale (increasing bets after each loss) on a specific section of the Roulette Board. Anyone with half a brain isn't gonna press their bets up to $1000 or more to chase a $10 profit. I immediately requested a refund. This book was a waste of time and money. I can't believe the author had the audacity to publish this with a straight face!"
1,the road to ruin,"""Great system""... ""blew me away""....I was shocked by the sheer stupidty of some of these comments.I have been playing roulette for over 20 years One thing I know for sure: if you follow this system you WILL be blown away - along with all your money. I bought the book and immediately realised the system is a simple progression that even the most idiotic players soon realize is the road to ruin.stay clear. There are far better books out there ""john Patricks roulette"" ..and russell Barnhart's ""beat the wheel"" ,for example."
1,Totally worthless information,"Using this supposed system will lead you to the poor house. I have read several books about playing roulette and while this book explains how to play, the premise of winning large amounts of money by using the betting system he espouses will not work on an ongoing basis. I consider it to be worthless information, or perhaps as Thomas Edison would have said, ""I succeeded in finding another way that won't work"""
4,Won money on my first visit,"I was a little skeptical at first, but this book made [money] for me on my first visit to the casino. Plan on going again soon when I get some time off. Definitely recommend this book. Well worth the price."
5,The Untouchables: Season 2 Volume 2,I loved the show and have always been interested in the crime sprees and criminals of the 20's and 30's. I would recommend it to all cop show fans. I have the first four complete series and if more released plan to purchase them also.
1,Not Going There,"Let me make this plain and simple. I refuse to buy half seasons of anything. I will wait and buy someones collection on Ebay for a REASONABLE price. Until then, I can live without half seasons. It's like buying a hot dog without the bun. If everyone thought like me they wouldn't pull this crap. Don't be an enabler."
1,Enough is Enough!,"The Program is first rate but Paramount's performance rates a ""F"".We as fans of the Untouchable Series showned our loyalty by buying the first season in half season sets at inflated prices.I will continue to purchase other series such as Mission Impossible where Paramount issues complete seasons for less than $35.However for the Untouchables I'm through.I will buy no more Untouchable programs at nearly $60 a season.If the execs at Paramount think this plan is good marketing just watch them drive loyal Untouchable fans away.In my case they have already succeeded.In the end Paramount will lose revenues, fans will lose the programs and Paramount will blame their mistakened greed on ""lack of buyer interest""."
4,"Great storylines, acting, plots","Have not seen all episodes yet, but the ones I have seen I have enjoyed the storylines, action, and actors. Well written. Will order a series at a time. Place it up against similiar modern series. Glad these DVDs were made available so younger audiences can view. My Dad requested that I get all of the volumes."
2,Need more album info,"I like this kind of music, but I would not purchase this item. Amazon needs to post the track listings."
2,Disappointing!,"Scattered old videos of different quality. Overall shamefully sub standard. No introduction, just jumps from one to another. Barely 30 minutes, not more, of actual performing, the rest is advances from very old TV shows (very annoying) that have nothing to do with Tom Jones. I love Tom Jones, some of the songs are worth watching but the rest, more than half of it, not worth it. The 2 stars are all for Tom and a couple of his invites."
3,"Geez, I must really be a Fatboy Slim fanatic!","Trust me, this set of 3 EPs is only for a truly insane Fatboy Slim fan (like yours truly). I would have to say that if you've only a basic knowledge of Norman Cook's work, the only one of these three worth buying is ""Illuminati"", the first one. As for ""Camber Sands"", I was let down after hearing the title track. ""Camber Sands"" wasn't as interesting as I was led to believe. It's quite tedious and there's not enough variation to keep things interesting. This EP is worth it for the interesting Chemical Brothers Mix of ""Song for Shelter"" as well as the extremely addictive Stanton Warriors Dub of ""Demons"". That's about it as far as the good tracks on here. There's an instrumental version of ""Weapon of Choice"" with a different ending, but it's not worth buying the whole EP over. Still, I'm sure if you do buy these three EPs, all your Fatboy Slim-crazy friends will think you're pretty cool ;-)"
3,Early Michael Douglas,"It was interesting to finally see this early film with Michael Douglas. I remember seeing a review of it many years ago in ""Show"" magazine. I must say even his early acting performances were impressive. And let's not forget the fine supporting cast of Jack Warden and Barbara Bel Geddes. Anthony Newely directed, and it wasn't even a musical!"
2,Obviously trying to cash in on Red Hat's dominance,"Red Hat is synonymous to Linux for many people, and this book is obviously trying to cash in on that. The editing of this book leaves much to be desired - there are some really terrible errors throughout. I am usually partial to books that have CDs with them, but in this case it doesn't add anything. The tools on the CD are freely downloadable from the internet, and are being updated constantly. The versions on the CD are very old, so you need to download new versions anyway.Overall, for my money, I'd buy the oreilly security book or the hacking linux exposed one."
3,One of the Best book in Security & Optimization,Great Book!! Great Writer!!Nice to have a book like this.
4,Very Good,"I've read a few Tom Perrotta books and am definitely a fan. His books have a workman-like quality. In a good way. I feel like I could hang out with him and have a beer and that he understands the regular folks out there. This book had some stereotypes in it but it also hit home for me. There are some universal themes like you're never going to find the answer to your problems in the next beautiful person, or if you don't clean up house with yourself, you're going to have problems with whoever you're with.That said, I'd like to see him develop a more complex, maybe literary character sometime. I have a feeling he has some writing chops that he isn't showing and I'd like to see them. Let's see a little flash sometimes. I'd like to hear a riff with some words I might not know, or concepts I might have to think through twice.Perotta novels are great for when you need a simple, summer-book type of read. Sometimes it's just what you need."
3,The perfect book for the mainstream literary masses,"I thought this book was an enjoyable read but not nearly as insightful or deep as most reviews seem to think it was. Not to be too cynical but it will make a great movie starring George Clooney and Michelle Phieffer (sp?) - oh, wait, they already made that!"
2,deja vu all over again,"I wanted to like this book since I am a fan of the author's other work. But something about it just didn't sit well with me. It does have it's humurous points and the relationship between Sarah and Todd is engaging. Overall though, it just feels like it was done before. Stories and satires about suburbia abound and this didn't really offer anything new to that conversation. The characters are fairly interesting though typical, but what is the point? None of the characters grew or changed really and the story didn't offer any new insights to suburban life. I just felt blah after reading this, like I neither got a particularly good story out of it or any new musings about modern life. I hope his next novel offers more."
3,A Decent Read,"Little Children is a decent read detailing the unmet expectations, missed opportunities, and fading dreams of a group of suburbia denizens. ""Little Children"" thematically is similar to the film ""American Beauty"".The characters plights are identifiable and empathetic; they have lived up to societal expectations of going to college, getting married, and having children but an emptiness resides within them and they are left seemingly questioning: ""now what?"". The book details the lengths to which the characters will reach to find some meaning in life, some missing entity that once discovered will provide a sense of engagement.Overall, a decent quick read. (The book is being adapted into a feature film starring Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly)"
1,Am I missing something?,"Little Children got great reviews, but I couldn't get past Chapter 1. Perrotta thinks he knows how women think, feel and talk, but he doesn't. His cliches are so embarrassing they made my toes curl. His prose was patronizing and superficial. I developed an attitude problem before I'd finished the first two sentences in the book: ""The young mothers were telling each other how tired they were. This was one of their favorite topics, along with the eating, sleeping, and defecating habits of their offspring, the merits of certain local nursery schools, and the difficulty of sticking to an exercise routine.""His characters sound like lobotomized Barbie dolls. Yech."
2,Why so much acclaim?,"I read all types of books, but when I picked this one up in the entry section of Borders recently, and noticed how much acclaim it had received, I thought I was in for a good read. Something a little deeper. I enjoyed reading it, and it read quickly, but, it was a little too soap-opera-y for me. Perhaps it bordered on a romance novel - which is one book type that I am not a fan of.I really do like a lot of the ""chick lit"" books, and I'm not sure this one quite qualifies, but I was disappointed in this one. I probably won't hunt down this author's other titles, given my experience with this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"I don't get why anyone would like this book. There is not one likeable character, no character development. The child molester part of the story seems not to fit in at all. I was reading for book group and felt I had to read. It was easy enough and fast enough of a read but the whole time I kept thinking that I was wasting my time reading this book when I could be doing other things. Wonder how the movie is. Maybe they changed the story or should I say made it into a story. Bad news - not recommended. So many other great books to read. But I must say, the others in the book group didn't think it was as bad as I did."
2,a bit boring,"actually i expected more from this book. the characters were boring, no real rythm, not even very interesting or funny."
2,Disappointing letdown,"As a fan of other satirical novels and films lambasting white, thirty-something surbubia, I had high hopes for Perrotta's book. Sadly, they were quickly dashed. The dialogue wasn't believable (who really uses the word ""creep"" anymore?) and I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters. Perhaps this was Perrotta's intention, but if that is the case then he needed to add something new to the discussion about dysfunctional suburban life. In this respect, he failed.In addition, the novel was quickly and awkwardly wrapped up in the final 5 pages or so. It's almost as if Perrotta himself couldn't quite believe what he was writing and wanted to be done with it."
2,waste of time,"I expected much more from this book which could've been great if not for the obvious cliches, and way too long football sequences. I read through it all with hopes that it would improve eventually, then it ended."
1,somewhat disappointed,"i've heard a lot of good things about perotta. but this novel was sophomoric and generally uninteresting. the last 50 pages read like someone's undergraduate creative mid-term writing assignment. obviously, this review will make no impact on the reading and book-buying public ---they will buy anything someone says is ""good"". i had to make a comment."
3,It was alright.,"I Didn't feel like the movie lost anything important from the book and the characters didn't seem to gain any depth in the book. Also, the movie ending was better."
2,Disappointing,One of the very few mistaken selections our Book Club chose.The writing was fair and the plot ordinary.A better writer might have taken any number of the topics touched on this novel and woven a more compelling story.
5,The suburbs aren't boring!,"How many novels are really written about those who live in the suburbs? Not many. I, myself, have longed to write about that which I know: life in the suburbs -- but where are the conflicts?Enter Tom Perrotta and ""Little Children."" Conflict arrives in the form of a recently released child molester. Interestingly enough, the child molester has a relatively small part in this story -- but brings the conflict around which a story can be written. The story, to me, was really much more about the secret lives of suburban comfort -- and disenchantment.I enjoyed this novel, not just for its novelty, but for the sensitive and interesting treatment of my world. Enjoy!"
4,Madame Bovary Goes Suburban in 2004,"What about the striking parallels between Madame Bovary and Sarah in this book? They both married older men who had previously been married. They both had one female child & had passionate love affairs to try and give some meaning to their lives. They both decided to leave with their lovers, not caring about their young child left behind. It's no coincidence that Sarah reads Madame Bovary for her bookclub and is so sympathetic to Madame Bovary's plight. The rest is filler...."
2,"Pedestrian, Mundane and Muddled","Some times readers are impressed by an earlier publication of an author and tend to read more into a book than there is. Little Children wouldn't make a good episode of ""Desperate Housewives"". There is nothing new here. Not only is it ""old"" but it's going through the motions old."
2,"I liked it, I didn't like it...","It's funny: I understand where all the previous reviewers are coming from, but I gotta be honest: I didn't ever feel like I was in suburbia! I do recognize character types and they are pretty-well portrayed, but they're really not altogether interesting people: they do act like ""little children.""I liked the dialogue; Perrotta is very good at this! And there is his brand of humor, which is also very good.I read the novel because I have read everything Perrotta has published, but I was left with an unsatisfactory feeling. As a reader, I didn't learn a damn thing from the novel. That's not a good thing... I couldn't enthusiastically recommend this novel to anyone for that reason."
3,nothing special,"I can't understand why this book is so popular and well-reviewed. Perrotta has some talent as a writer and the book was easy to read. But I found it pedestrian and lacking any true insights about anything. The characters just barely rise above stereotypes. Nothing is resolved. There are no surprises. Overall, not a terrible book but not a great one."
3,"Beginning too slow, ending too fast",I had the impression that the author just got tired of the story and came up with a quick ending so he could move on to something else. All of the characters behaved out of context in the end. A disappointing ending to an overall mediocre book.
3,Wandered off the playground,"Thought provoking at times, occasionally tedious and occasionally fun almost like the tenth day sitting at the park with the kids. I found the characters shallow and had difficulty understanding their motivations. Too often they seemed more juvenile than their children. I gave it three stars for its readibility and a certain ring of honesty throughout though it ended poorly. Felt it could have been so much more but the author lost interest at the end."
2,A Real Letdown,"I'd read Perrotta's ""Bad Haircut"" and though I haven't gotten around to reading the book, I found the movie version of ""Election"" to be witty satire. So, with all the great reviews this book got, and the hype from the movie surrounding Jackie Earle Haley's Oscar nomination, I was expecting great things. Boy, was I disappointed. It never grabbed my interest, and I eventually found myself anxious to get to the end, hoping he might redeem himself there, but still no. I couldn't get myself to like or care about any of the characters, and the story lines were blandy predictable and not at all compelling. In the first chapter, Mary Ann seemed like she might provide an interesting story line, at least from a saticical point of view, but she just disappeared (except for one brief chance encounter, another highly contrived plot element) until the last few pages. Save your time, don't read this."
3,"Fast read, Great til the end!!","I loved this book and was so taken by it from when I first picked it up. I finished it last night and found the ending to be very disappointing, blah, and makes me not really like the book anymore."
2,Wanted it to be better,"This book is a fast read. It was enjoyable enough, but I have some problems with it. I just don't think Perrotta gets the female ""voice"" right--not like say, Wally Lamb did in ""She's Come Undone"". Most of the characters are over-the-top, especially the retired cop, and a lot of the situations that they face are a bit unrealistic. Would Catholics really switch sides of a church mid-service if a child molester sat among them? The satire, however, is dead on. One Catholic met her husband in a wet t-shirt contest.The biggest problem I have is with the utter lack of any love these parents show for their children. While it does mirror my neighborhood quite well in that respect, I really felt like Sarah and/or Todd needed to have some remorse for what they did because they cared so much for their children. The best one mother can do is say ""Isn't he a cutie pie?"" several times.Given that, it is really hard to feel anything for the characters. Not even pity."
3,"dark humor, but nothing special","The book definitely kept me engaged, and it had some great dark comedy. It didn't really have anything that stuck with me, though."
3,How a Bunch of Lousy People = Good Book,"Lust, lies, disenchantment, dishonesty, adultery - why, it's the suburbs of course!!!This story of suburbanites and their bad marriages ends up being a fast paced, funny, and poignant read. No, Perrota is not saying that suburbanites are doomed to bad marriages, but he does call every bad marriage coping mechanism to carpet in a most entertaining fashion. I've got to give it up to Tom Perrota for creating a thoroughly entertaining book out of such a thoroughly unlikable group of characters. He doesn't overreach, but at the same time the book takes us through life's inevitable curves with surprising insight and honesty."
1,Sorry but I thought it was drivel,"It was a day-time soap opera. With equally unbelievable story lines. I'd heard that they made a movie of it before I started reading it and now that I'm done I can see why, the story is just like the movies of late...drivel. And I loved Election."
2,Not Sure,"Hhhmmm....I didn't love this book yet I didn't hate it either. I was initially turned completely off by the satirical suburban angst-filled, sexually obsessed and self absorbed tone of the characters at first but once I just relaxed and went with it I admit I found the dialogue VERY funny, like a previous reader said, laugh out loud funny at times. I couldn't relate to any of the characters (thankfully) even though I'm a working mom and have lived in the suburbs.They all seemed so stereotypically exaggerated but maybe that's part of the point of satire. I thought the ending was building towards some huge climax and was a little let down but I guess it fit. (I was totally grossed out by Sarah's fungally infected toenails and the thought of Todd......oh, never mind.)I give the book 1 star for dialogue and 1 star for inspiring me to check ""Madame Bovary"" out from the library."
4,Simply a good read,"Heartbreakingly honest and frequently funny. Perotta manages to get inside the heads of all his characters: a 30-ish would-be academic who seemingly wandered into her role as wife and mother; a golden boy turned stay-at-home dad; an ex-cop who turns his energy to running down the town's child molester. Heck, even the child molester -- while not a sympathetic figure -- has a certain compelling complexity. The book would have been fine as a simple character study, but it benefits from a slow-building, quietly suspenseful plot. I'm docking the book one star for a few reasons: the kids' voices didn't ring true, a couple of secondary characters were a little too broadly drawn and the football scenes grew tiresome. Read it anyway."
2,Surprisingly Dull,"You would think a book filled with adultery, pornography, and pedophilia would be compelling or at least disturbing-- anything but boring. Sadly, boring, more than anything, is what it is. The book's characters are flat and almost uniformly unsympathetic. Almost nothing, from the dialogue to the adult ""children"" of the title, to the actual children, to the situations, from the most mundane to the most bizarre, rang true. The ending, which I won't reveal, was both anticlimactic and totally bizarre, which is quite a feat, I suppose. It's not a terrible book, and, unlike some reviewers, I didn't find it offensive, but I definitely won't be reading it again."
3,Decent.,Perotta has a great writing style - it's sardonic and sharp-witted. He does a good job with characters in this one and giving everyone a voice. Worth reading. Quite a fast read.
3,A little rote,"This is a witty book, keenly observed. But after a while you get the sense that what Perrotta is observing is other novels, films, and tv shows about suburbia. The humor is almost all situational (Todd, a one-time star athlete, revels in his seemingly ill-fitting duties as a Mr. Mom type), and recognizable types are quickly sketched out--the feminist cum mommy, the remote exec who ensconces himself in his rec room, the PowerMom with the cellphone glued to her ear who schedules sex dates with her husband, the sweaty, pudgy child molester--for us to appreciate. It's sort of like a Todd Solondz movie, but cuter. If you don't accept the conventional wisdom concerning the suburbs or suburban types, then the book will leave you pretty cold."
2,nothing special,"...yeah, i don't quite understand all the hype surrounding this book. it wasn't anything special. the plot was ridiculously predictable, unimaginative, and, frankly, boring. the writing was particularly ""blah."" i wasn't impressed. money down the drain...if you're still interested, borrow this book from a friend or your local library."
1,My entire book group hated it!,"I am still mystified by the popularity of this book. Generally, my group splits 3:2 on a book, with some loving the book that month and some not liking it so much. We've never agreed so completely on a book before. I can't figure out where it is coming from and who it's intended audience is. The reviews called it a hilarious parody. I found it neither. Nor did I find it deeply affecting. All I can figure is that it was written by a man and is full of ""male humor"", so I'm missing it. I also think, perhaps wrongly, that the author isn't really that familiar with daytime suburban life, so what he thought was over the top, was actually pretty close to true. I really never came to care that much about the 2 main characters. I never really cared about the book."
2,Depressing,"I dont want to be the kind of person that recaps the whole book, i just want to tell you how i felt about it, and my impression... I thought that this book was... a little slow, very depressing, and it just seemed to go on and on and alot of things happened that didnt really need too. Everyone seems to love this book... and i jsut dont see it... I thought it was ok but i wouldnt reccommend it, and i wouldnt want to read it again... It's just depressing, and it makes you not want to advance in life. I wasnt thrilled"
3,Master of puppets,"Like ""Being John Malkovich,"" the hero of ""Little Children"" is a puppeteer--but in the novel's case the puppeteer is the author, smirking from the behind the scenes at the misadventures of his creations. Perrotta is dead-on in capturing 30-something anomie and delusions of suburban life, and he's skilled at creating a plot that's compelling and just this side of outlandish. But the novel was gone from my mind as soon as the last page was turned--recent chick flick ""The Wedding Date"" was more thought-provoking. It's a good read, but basically an empty shell. Oh well, what do you expect from a puppet show?"
1,Can I give this ZERO stars?,"This was probably the worst book I've ever read. Between frumpy housewives with fantasies, the child molester next door, and the ridiculously languid descriptions about how ""hot"" the key male character is (and his signature ""corkscrew"" move--GROSS), this book did nothing but make me grimace in despair that I actually kept turning pages. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY and get yourself some smut elsewhere, you will not find it here. This book made me more uncomfortable than anything else, and to the author, if you are marketing toward women, leave out the page after page description of a tackle football club sport game. Poor, weak story line, awkward relation to the reader, amateur writing at best. Makes me wish I had bought 50 Shades of Gray and felt awkward at the S&M instead; I'd rather have some blood pumping than to have to read about child molesters in the midst of a ""love"" (if you can call it that) story."
2,PURE JUNK,"Nothing new or interesting here. Boring, egotistical,shallow characters. You won't care a thing about any one of them. Don't waste your money or your time."
3,conventional,"Although the story was engaging, I found it a bit too conventional for my tastes. I wasn't particuarly impressed by the author's style of writing. It took some time for the development of the characters to take place, and by the time I identified with the characters I had, quite frankly, lost interest in the story. This was by no means a terrible book, but not one of Perrota's best, either."
2,Pass on this one,"I picked up this book looking for an interesting story, but what I found was a far-fetched suburbia story with unrelatable characters and a lame plot. It was easy to read, and I stuck it out till the end, hoping for a good ending, but I was disappointed. There really was no good resolution for the characters in this story, they were written into a corner. (I suppose this is true in life as well.) I found the sex offender character a far fetch from real life and a bit stereotypical, making me think the author didn't do much research for this character. There were some good sections and realistic qualities but mostly I was just tired with the story by the end and wanted it to be over!"
3,I really wanted to like this book,"I really, really wanted to like this book. I can enjoy making fun of suburbia with the best of them. But this book was rife with shallow portrayals of (what felt to me like) stock characters. My main problems with the book: no one in this book had a happy marriage, and more importantly, no one in the book seemed happy at all in their own skins.This book reminded me of one of the worst criticisms I ever read of the films Election and About Schmidt (both directed by Alexander Payne, but Election was based on the book by Tom Perrota, the author of Little Children) -- the criticism was that you get the feeling during the movie that the director/ screenwriter hates his characters. I do absolutely get the feeling that Perrota hates his characters in this book. And I started to hate them too."
2,A fluffy lite read,Don't let the average 4 out of 5 star reviews fool you! This book was very fluffy....more like a Monday night movie on cable...right down to the 15 minute wrap up in the end.
4,a satire on Uncle Sam,"Although I've never lived in suburban America, this story is I think a good reflection of certain people and relationships in American suburbia today, whether we're talking about flawed Sarah, the over-educated feminist yet stay-at-home mom who has a secret affair with a stay-at-home dad named Todd... who is not her husband of course; or whether we're talking about the perfect over-achieving mom Mary Ann who has things strictly planned out, even exactly what time she'll have sex with her hubby!; or whether we're talking about Larry the over-zealous ex-cop. All these people have kids and all their lives take a turn when a child molester moves into their neighborhood. I didn't like the characters in the book, but I suspect I'm not supposed to anyway. I did like the book."
2,"Well-paced and exciting, but character development falls flat.","I've read _Election_, and I went into this book hoping for more of the same--developed, interesting characters and a plot that kept me guessing. Unfortunately, Tom Perrotta has apparently become the next incarnation of Dean Koontz, complete with the action-packed unrealistic ending and the flat-as-a-pancake Evil Guy. People just don't behave the way that the characters do in this novel, especially at the end.I enjoyed the writing--on the whole, Perrotta is a very talented author and deserves to do well. I think, though, that he can do much better than this book. When I finished reading the novel, I actually threw it away because I was so frustrated with the shallow character development and the typical deus ex machina ending (in this case, the ""god"" was somehow in the characters' heads, making them behave in ways completely unlike the people who they were supposed to be). I've never thrown a book away before.But this one deserved it."
5,Little Children,"I loved this book. It is funny, thought provoking, and believable. The characters are well developed and while some are truly ""characters"", you say to yourself as you are reading the book that people like this really do exist. The ending was fantastic, one of the best endings in a book that I can remember. I was the first to read this and now it is going through my family - wife and two twentysomething daughters. It's a keeper."
4,suburban angst and the pain of parenting,"Oh the woes of being a stay-at-home mom -- or dad! You're devoted to your offspring; you want to provide a loving, stimulating, safe childhood. But it can be so boring! That's the dilemma of the characters of this classic of suburban angst.There are other, less savory threats lurking among the manicured lawns -- child molesters, homophobes, violent vigilantes. The sub-plot revolving around these types is the least successful part of this book. The sexual weirdness of another character also detracts from the whole.The center of the book is a familiar saga of adultery, in this case very well done. One feels the yearning of these poor stay-at-homes for love, attention, and self-esteem in a society which does not esteem them or their sacrifice.Perotta has a rare gift of raising serious issues of our society in an entertaining way. Bravo for this!For more about me and my book,The Nazi Hunter: A Novelgo to [...]."
5,Edgy and Modern,"I was really impressed with this book! I hadn't ever read any thing by this author, although I'd seen the movie Election. Really glad it was chosen for my book club!An edgy and modern book about marriage and parenthood. I felt it was a realistic portrayal of both, as well as the ending. Really liked the ending! The characters were interesting, fun and DIVERSE. I don't think I've read a book in a long time that's had such diverse and fascenating characters- not just one but nearly all.I highly recommend this book, esp. to those of us married and or parents. Something you can relate to is always a good read."
3,No good people,"I did not like any of the characters in this book. They all need to grow up- I guess that's the point, but it makes it hard for me to enjoy the book when I don't have much empathy for the characters. It drives me crazy that the main character doesn't seem to love her 3 year old daughter. I wanted to smack her (the mother not the daughter)."
1,Drama or Comedy?,"As I read this book, I kept asking myself if I should be laughing or disgusted/sad/angry at the events and characters in this book. I would have stopped reading if it wasn't for one of the story lines that seemed remotely interesting. You don't get to know the characters very well and a few are introduced late in the book as if the author said ""oops, I forgot this person!"" It seemed as if this book was written for a Lifetime Movie or maybe Comdey Central."
2,Unimpressed,"I guess I have to join the group of readers who just don't understand why the critics seemed to love this book. The characters were two-dimensional; the plot was contrived; the humor was hit or miss; and the ending seemed rushed (though it couldn't come fast enough for me) and wasn't very satisfying. The characters certainly didn't seem to grow organically. Mostly the book just didn't seem to ring true. I could see the writer working in the background, adding bits of detail to fluff up the verisimilitude. A jester's cap for Todd's son? That just seemed a ridiculous. The one-dimensional skateboarders are thrown in there pretty much as a plot device, and not a very good one. I didn't much care for the dialogue, especially coming from the stereotyped characters, which this book has in abundance.I give it 2 stars because I actually laughed at some parts, but I would have gladly traded those laughs for some believable characters."
2,Disappointing!!!,"If Perrotta's goal was to create characters who are shallow and selfish that you loathe by the end of the last page, the man is simply brilliant! I kept thinking the whole time that the author was developing the wrong characters. Maybe I'm just atypical..but this was not anything like MY transition into adulthood. I thought the book was as shallow and predictable as its characters....excluding the last 25 pages or so. Here's a real challenge...how about a book that TRULY deals with transition into adulthood...young adults trying to figure out how they got to where they are, all the while struggling to do what's right and live up to the choices they've made. I guess that's too much to ask. Don't let the major reviews fool you...this is not that book. Oh, I also didn't find this book as comedic as I did disturbing. I did not have a single laugh-out-loud moment with this book. I didn't find a bit of it funny in the least."
3,A satirical Desperate Housewives in a novel.,"I was expecting a really light read when I picked this one up and although it's certainly not heavy I was pleasantly surprised by the realistic characters and their storylines. While not hilariously funny it had just the right touches of humour, based on the observation of couples and marriages which I could certainly relate to.Heck I even enjoyed reading about the (American) football!!"
1,"i'm not a kid, and i would give this zero stars","i had this book assigned as a college english assignment. The man who wrote this book is a pervert and i can't believe that anyone could enjoy it. beware because this book is low class and borderline pornographic, actually it is not really borderline as it is extremely explicit. on top of the pervertedness of this book, it is not one bit interesting or well written. i cannot believe that i was assigned this book in english class considering it is not even a good piece of literature. anyways this book is probably Tom Perrotta's fantasy of what suburban life is, because it doesn't even come close. what a horrible perverted author, buyers beware, anyone looking for a clean book should stay away, heck anyone looking for an intellegent read or interesting story should stay away as it is quite a snooze. if english proffesors are assigning Little Children as an assignment, there is no telling what they will do next."
2,"Dreary, squalid tale of uninteresting people","Reading ""Little Children"", I couldn't help but think of John D. MacDonald, who would've written this kind of story in a couple of weeks--and done a much better job.I wish I could've enjoyed this novel more, but the characters (or caricatures) just aren't very interesting, and there is no real protagonist.Instead, we get a routine tale of love and adultery in the suburbs, with a paroled child molester thrown into the mix. Too bad he wasn't a mad bomber; he might've blown up the whole group on page 9 and saved the readers a lot of wasted time."
4,kept my attention,"It takes ALOT for me to finish a book. I just don't have time to sit down and read, and when I do I find myself distracted by a million other things. I found myself thinking about the characters in this book all day at work and growing impatient to finish dinner, crawl in bed and read it! I thought it was GREAT! I was a tad disappointed with the way it ended, but you can't have everything right. It's a miracle I got that far. I would reccomend it."
1,"eh, I wasn't impressed",I was quite surprised to find folks that gave this book 4 or 5 stars. I read their reviews and am still scratching my head. Perhaps I don't get it. Or perhaps it's just not my kinda book. I wasn't impressed with the plot. The characters are childish so I felt the title was apt but I wasn't impressed with the stupid characters and the ending was ho-hum.
4,Still Waters Run Deep,"Mr. Perrotta knows how to tell a story, as proven by this well paced page turner that I found to be entertaining and disturbing all at the same time. He takes us behind the closed doors (and minds) of suburban life and offers us a look at the darker side, that is both sad and all too real. Very good writing that should be on the must read list!"
4,Haven't seen the movie but...,"I will say I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK (and the Amazon price of $7 or so was excellent), it was well-written and kept my interest, I was just hoping for a better ... well read it and find out. It was entertaining enough just expected more drama."
2,No resolution,"I usually enjoy Tom Perrota, despite his apparent allergy to denouement. This one lead you down a road that was at times either uncomfortable without purpose or depressingly banal. I stuck it out to the very end, and if it wasn't for the fact that my Kindle was so expensive, I would have thrown it in disgust. I need more than colorful characters - I need them to say something, do something, other than the ordinary. Otherwise, I'd just watch the drama in my own subdivision."
4,I *loved* this book.,"I read Little Children in three sittings because it was just that good. Perrotta presents a darkly funny look at suburbia and the secrets and lies hidden within. The basic subject matter (women and men bored with their lot in life) isn't terribly original, but Perrotta's writing takes the story to another level. The book moves swiftly and focuses on several main characters, including a child molester recently released from prison, who sets off a series of life-changing events when he moves into town.The only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is the ending. It came all too abruptly and wrapped up a few things a bit too nicely (and too quickly) for my comfort. Despite this slight disappointment, the book is a fantastic read and I can't wait to watch the movie version."
3,Torn,Perrotta's writing is exquisite but the subject matter was so disturbing that I was unable to finish it. It's difficult for me to stick with a story in which I feel empathy for none (or few) of the characters
3,Depressing,"I liked this book and it was well written. However it was quite depressing. Even with so many characters it was hard to find one that's likable. I'm guessing ""Little Children"" equally describes both the parents of the young children and the children themselves that live in a suburban New England community in the late nineties. The story centers around a group of stay at home moms and the one stay at home dad that enter's their playground. They all seem to be drifting through lives and spouses that they chose but seem to resent. The ending is a little strange but fitting. At times I was going to give up but I'm glad I pulled through it as there were more interesting than dull parts. The depressing part is that although the characters are unlikable I cannot say they are not believable."
4,Enjoyable,I really liked this book. I liked the writing style. The story was fast paced and the characters managed to seem real yet this book functions very well as a satire. I laughed out loud multiple times. I did think things got a little messy with the child molester. That part of the story had potential but it seemed like Perrotta didn't quite have a thorough understanding of him. I thought Sarah was so realistic that I double checked to make sure the author was a man instead of a woman.
2,greatly magnified,"the beads are greatly magnified, so i paid $35 for a necklace suitable for a child"
5,Very refreshing....GET IT!!!,"I read some previous reviews of this album and it prompted me to write this. This album is HILARIOUS. I think the songs are great and the commercials are funny too. Yes it's a trip through an old Soul Train show. AS for the folks who ""don't get it"" or ""blacks will be offended"", GET A CLUE. It's comedy. It's supposed to poke fun. Ever hear of Richard Pryor or Chris Rock? They really make fun of white folks like me and it's funny. It's COMEDY..PARODY. The skit about the scramble word board will make you cry it's so funny. Get this album y'all. It's different, but refreshing. Also, the music is awesome!!"
1,The Title say's it All.,"After listening to this album, it apears as though Tim Wilson hit the nail on the head with this title. This has to be the worst comedy album I have ever heard. Super Bad Sounds of the 70's should be called ""the very worst album of 2003""I would return the album and get my money back if i could. i am totally disappointed with this purchase.take your money and buy something better, this album is nothing more than an expensive coaster."
3,"Guess I ""missed"" it.","The 70's groove was neat, but not enough in my opinion to cement together the mediocre songs. It's like taking a Saturday Night Live Skit and making it into a full length movie(Pat), Tim turned funny jokes into weak songs.I think too much focus was placed on the 70's theme and not enough on the comedy. Sorry, Tim, but I know you can do better!"
1,Absolute Pets,"This product was ordered on 4/14/2009. I have not received this product, I was informed that the product was shipped. I contacted the company asked for reshipment, I have as yet heard from them. I then asked for The company and Amazon to refund my payment. This has not been done. I will no longer be using Amazon and definitely not recommend Absolutely Pets. I have tried to call the number listed for Absolutely Pets, they have only and answering service, they have not returned my call."
1,Poor and quite inaccurate...,"The birth year should indicate a lot for those who know Mr. Udall. He was not born in 1957, and there are other points of misinformation throughout. Be very cautious in taking all that's written here as truth."
5,Take Charge!,This book helped me understand that I'm the one in charge. The caregivers work for me and I see now that I need to take more control of the situations. It's a great resource for all aspects of people management.
5,More excellent Willis stories,"If you need help getting into the Christmas mood, try this book. Connie Willis takes Christmas themes we've all read thousands of times before and turns them to unexpected ends. Not all the stories are happy -- a couple are dark. And the last one, ""Epiphany"", I didn't like at all till I'd gone away and thought about it for a while. I like stories that make me smile and stories that make me think. This collection has both. Thanks, Connie -- you're a genius."
4,"Delightful stories, even to a bah-humbug sort like me","Unlike Connie Willis, I *don't* love Christmas. I don't put up Christmas lights, I don't kill a tree, and I don't send out Holiday Letters. Yech.But this collection of short stories made me contemplate becoming a Christmas fan. That's because Willis -- as in her other work -- writes about people with warmth and humor. Even if it's people who encounter a new-age Christmas Present or get trapped in a strange little toy store. She manages to capture what Christmas is *supposed* to be about -- faith, hope, love -- without falling into sappy sentimentality.Forget the Christmas stuff. These are simply enjoyable short stories. You'll fall into another world, 20 pages at a time. And that's what fiction's all about."
5,"I've Got That ""Holiday Feeling""","If you love Christmas stories like I do you'll definitely want to read this book. I'm not a big science fiction fan, but I very much enjoyed most of these stories. One story revolves around the movies ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" and another story is reminiscent of ""A Christmas Carol.""The introduction, in which Ms. Willis discusses some of her favorite Christmas movies and stories, is just fascinating. Then at the end of the book she recommends some more of her favorites. Some of these stories were hard to track down, but thanks to my librarian and the Short Story Index, I finally found them. Now I've got some new Christmas reading all ready for this year. Shouldn't you get this book and be ready, too?"
2,Nice but formulaic,"After reading some of Connie Willis' other work I was excited to read more. Her forward on avoiding the tropes of X-mas stories further bolstered my hope that this would be something special. However, the first story written violates pretty much every trope she mentions just pages before the story, and everything else seems like a variant of another story you had heard.This gave me the feel of stories she made up for her family on x-mas eve, not something that she put as much thought into as her full stories. Things ended up feeling a little underdeveloped, and what could have been magical became just passable."
3,Fun Christmas Tales,"Cute collection of Christmas tales (which I'm a sucker for!). Not your typical saccharine-sweet fare. Instead there's a murder mystery, an alien invasion, and more.Willis is a great writer but often I felt thrust into the story with no idea of who the characters were. Just a little description (physical, age, temperament) would have helped distinguish them in my mind. Instead, many seemed interchangeable.All the same, it was a fun and quick read."
2,Disappointing...,"I generally love Connie Willis novels, and had read great things about this book. I must have missed something. A couple of the stories were okay, which got me through the rest of them. But overall, I was not entertained or interested, and found most of the stories rather pointless. Yes, I know there were supposed to be messages or morals conveyed in the stories. They just didn't pack any punch for me, which I am sorry to say."
1,Absolute Drivel,"I wish I could give this *NO STARS*. Connie, what happened??! I was looking for a nice gift to get my friends for Christmas--I have been a huge Connie Willis fan ever since I opened ""Bellwether"" and stayed up all night to finish it--and I thought this would be perfect. Her other books are nothing short of brilliant, ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" is perfect, so what happened here? I tried desperately to like it, but I was so glad I checked it out of the library before spending money on it buying my very own copy. The stories are nothing short of incredibly clumsy, fanciful and amateurish writing where Connie continually slaps you about the face to remind you of her pure dislike of the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Okay! Enough already! We get the point! I've read better. It's ultimately cheesy. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs. (And to the other reviewers...did you even read this book?)"
5,Connie Willis puts a new twist on Christmas,"My mom picked this book up from the library and almost didn't get it back after I got my hands on it. I was pleasantly surprised by Connie's reader-interactive letters at start and finish, but more so by her stories. I was expecting warm-fuzzy; I got stories that made me think and sent my mind spinning for hours after reading them. Normally I finish a book and move on, but these stories would not let me rush them. I couldn't stand to ruin the effect of the previous one by moving on to the next! I especially liked her practical interpretation of Joseph and Mary, pointing out that they would not have been more than barely pubescent when they were wed. This is an awesome read, and I will definitely be buying more of her books. Be warned though, my mother (who is an avid reader) found it Twilight Zone-ish and a waste of time."
4,Larger than it looks in the picture,"This camera/cell phone bag is larger than the picture and comfortably holds my Nixon 4200 digital camera as well as batteries, and other accessories. It has enough room for any size cell phone and can be used as a mini bag by male or female.Good quality leather, sturdy and well constructed.Well worth the cost."
4,fleh is fun,Hello. my mom got this book for my little brother birthday and we have lots of fun playing the game. I wish that all my firends get this book so we can play with them. Please ask santa claus for this book for christmas. Thank you (...)
2,undergraduate,Fine for undergraduates but of little use to the orthopaedic trainee. Better off with one of the Thieme series.
3,Great Idea but flawed,"I work in Urgent Care. The book's concept is excellent. I have used the book for minor orthopedic complaints such as sprains and strains, and found it wanting. It's good for more serious injuries; having the anatomy right there for you is invaluable."
5,tight set,"i've always dug myself some con funk shun and there brand of music making has a interesting texture going through it. Chase me, ffun, too tight and what i call one of the last ultimate DJ(when the local DJ counted on Radio and could make that album cut feel like a Hit song and it wasn't even released to radio like that) created cuts that took off""Love's train. so many tight jams here and this set is on point. I always dug there vocal harmony and arrangements."
1,The Si Zentner Orchestra and the Johnny Mann Singers,I found this CD to be too jazzy for my tastes. The music was too fast and at time overshadowed the singers.
5,Great book to learn how to carve wood spirits,"Got the book, gathered some tools--1/4"" gouge, 1/8"" gouge, 1/4"" v tool, a kevlar glove, and a knife. Picked up a glue-lamed stick of pine 1x2's, rounded it off to about a 1 1/2"" somewhat rounded stick, and then carved my first wood spirit according to the book. I've done another one as a pendant ornament in a 3/4"" trianglular piece of basswood, and working on a second face in the pine stick. All in about a week or so--this from a guy who hates to carve faces! Good book!"
5,A work of Art,"This is the most comprehensive history of N. American Indians I have read. It is easy to read and understand, and the lithographs are works of art. If one can have only one book on this subject, it should be this one. The original lithographs have become a valued collector's item. McKenny was an indian agent during a very important era in the history of our native Americans. I reccommend this to young and old. A super thing to buy for your teenage children and grandchildren."
5,Good Good Good,"This book was very good. I would reccommend it to any woman who is struggling with getting over her past. Cami Deni is a good illustrator and I hope to have the chnace to meet her. I would love the chance to hear her whole story. It sounds as if she has been through a lot and is using her pain to free others. I especially like the prayer for her children, it's practical and real. She also prays for their future spouses and their parents that they will get good teaching and training BEFORE they meet her kids. That advice alone to ANY mother is priceless. the book is really fast...you won't labor over it long, but it will chnage your life if you listen. It was hard to find though. get it through Amazon or the Xulon Website fo rthe quickest turn around."
5,A great addition to the dolhouse,"My daughter received the dollhouse for Christmas, but only a couple of the accessory pieces. Once we bought this one for her birthday, she uses the dollhouse all the time. Now she has someplace for the sister to sleep. If only they made a brother bed...he wouldn't have to sleep in the bathtub! The bedroom set is durable, but the pillow and blankets are a little big to stay on the bed, but my daughter doesn't seem to mind."
1,BEWARE,"Ordered the Trundle, Got the other set. Don't understand as I ordered the doll house and the living room and they arrived just fine."
