1,Horrible Attack on Buddhist Traditions,This book is a horrible and shameful attack on Buddhist faiths. People who have such unbiased and negative views toward Buddhist traditions other than their own should not write books and pretend to be experts on other traditions.
4,Does a pretty decent job,"Bought it specifically for my nuwave oven, because I wanted clean up to be fairly easy. Have found that silicone bakingpans are pretty user friendly. Rub some oil in it, the items baked come out effortlessly, clean up is a snap. Was using stoneware & glass & ceramic, had to spend way too much time cleaning the pans. Gave it a 4 because silicone pans are really flexible so you have to figure out a system of picking them up without spilling the contents."
4,Silicon for Pies?,"I used this silicon round cake pan for a pie, and I won't do it again. It's great for cakes, but making a pumpkin pie and trying to get the pan into the oven filled with liquid was not a good idea.Like I said, for cakes, great pan, not for pies that are liquid."
4,decent,"This dvd contains 4 Our Gang episodes in black-and-white: The Pooch, Fly My Kite, Hi Neighbor, and Mary Queen of Tots. Two of these episodes are featured on The Little Rascals 3-pk or 2-pk in Color, which include both color and black-and-white versions: http://www.amazon.com/Little-Rascals-2-pack-Black---White/dp/B0019UGYDC/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1329653119&sr=8-8 (highly recommended)! This dvd is still worth a few bucks just for The Pooch episode, while Mary Queen of Tots is a much older silent episode which is older with less quality."
4,Good quality,"This ""generic"" 50 gram Chrome weight (from Seller Newcool) has a quality look and feel; with a smooth, uniform finish that seems thick and durable.After testing it on 3 of my scales, the weight seems to be very close to 50 grams. It should be EXACTLY 50 grams to some number of decimals (determined by many factors). I hope to compare it to a scale weight of know accuracy to be sure.This ""Chrome"" weight appears to be well made. -- I also bought a generic 100 gram ""Stainless"" weight (from a diff. Seller) thinking Stainless would be even higher quality but I found that quality disappointing. I doubt it's even Stainless, I suspect the 100g weight is just a shoddy chrome weight, So Beware."
3,Exactly weighs 50 grams BUT............,"The weight will rust in a matter of a few months, even in the best conditions. My stayed in my case and was never exposed to moisture nor chemicals yet it looks like the hull of the titanic."
3,Accurate,"Okay for calibrating. Did you know that one uncirculated US Nickle weighs precisely 5 grams? When you do the math, 6 Nickles are about a 'z'. When I bought this, the shipping cost more than the weight."
3,Only half the weight of a 100 gram calibrator!,Using several scientific trials I have verified that this 50 gram calibration weight is exactly 50 grams. Coincidentally it's exactly 50 grams lighter than a 100 gram weight. Who needs those extra 50 grams anyway!? This calibrator does the job for me.
3,20 gm chrome scale calibration wt,"I bought this weight when I bought the accuteck postal scale. It was a scale that had an original price of 89.99 and was on sale. I zeroed the scale and put this on it, and when I weighed it, the measurement was .55? gm"
5,Scale Weight,Great for me since my scale is off by a few tenths of a gram. I just test it with this before each use to know how off the reading is.
3,50-Gram Chrome Scale Calibration Weight,This weight does the job that it was intended to do; i.e. it just sits there and exudes heaviness.I like it.
4,testing scales,I use this and one other larger to verify my powder scale. One would be enough but 2 make me feel better.
4,Got it but can't use it yet,"I bought this calibration weight for the ""American Weigh Signature Series Black Digital Pocket Scale, 1000 by 0.1 grams"" but it can only use a 100g one. Could use this product yet. Wish the scale's description has specified what calibration weight it takes."
4,APPEARS TO BE A HIGH-QUALITY ITEM.,I would give this calibration weight five stars based on its apparent quality but I can't vouch for its accuracy.
2,"Pefect weight, but needed a 500gram","I ordered a 500gram weight, but received a 50gram. Was very displeased with the order. I'd recommend double checking what your order is when placing an order with these people."
1,"do not order, wrong weight",AMAZ suggest you buy this with the scale but it is too heavy form most small gram scales - rip
3,Valuable resource for those interested in the Monarchs.,"If you are interested in the general history and sociological setting of the Kansas City Monarchs, this piece of research is for you. If you are looking for a book of hopping stories and personal Monarch players, you should look eleswhere.This book is an obvious academic study (perhaps written as part of a master's or doctorate program) and has the feel of a textbook. Not a lot of thrilling baseball information for the fan, but if you are interested in understanding the business side of the the Negro Leagues and what the social effects of baseball on the community were, this is an invaluable resource. Well researched and detailed, this book will be used as a great secondary source for those who are interested in the Negro Leagues and in particularly the Monarchs."
1,Ho Hum,"I did not think this was worth the price, my gun does not go into the holster easily (it does draw out easily tho. It does not hold the gun well or securely. The only positive is that it is thin and easy to conceal."
3,Good features but broken in a year,"I bought this device last year and was definitely impressed with its capability/features considering its size. Here are some things that future buyers might take into consideration: (1) The speakers are not that good (I have to use a separate headphones with it) (2) try to check out what is Pioneers warranty regarding dead pixels (3) check out your other devices (TV, Audio receivers) connectivity for you might need to buy extra cables to enjoy the Dolby Digital/DTS features. The major drawback for me is after having the device for a little more than a year, the player is having a problem playing (won't play, stops intermittently). Considering that i don't use the player to play other media (only DVD), and all DVDs played with it are new DVDs."
4,Why can't I buy a second battery?,DVD player works great but is useless without having two batteries. I can't seem to find where to buy a backup. Do not buy it unless you want to be caught in a long plane flight without a backup battery and your kids are in the middle of a movie.
5,just by a great set of headphones,"For the price and portabilty.................this one is a winner! I travel all the time and simply have an excellent pair of headphones to make my movies just as enjoyable as my home theater system. And yes......it is true that the 7"" screen could be a ""little"" more precise, but the big flic is that this is a PORTABLE machine/aka ""toy"" to make my travels more comfortable. Do yourself a favor, keep focused on ""how"" you will use the portable dvd player and then simply buy the best set of user friendly headphones you can afford (I personally use the Koss Porta Pro (folds small...takes up little to no space) and my 3 y/o uses the Koss Porta Pro Jr:). AND REMEMBER....... how many hotel room television sets have home theater sound and huge flat screens?!! (Yes, my 3y/o watches Disney on extended trips, pass back the player, plug in the auto adapter and.....VOILA!.........""I spy does get old after a while:)"
5,Worthy of Woodward,"I consulted this book for background on how the administration handled the Bosnian war and got swept into it. Drew is an outstanding writer, and her style is reminiscent of Bob Woodward's.This presents a full account of Clinton and his aides, their battles, their personalities, etc. Clinton definitely had a rough going early on...it's hard to believe he stayed so popular all along.Anyway, if you like Woodward's stuff (All the President's Men, Commanders, the Brethren, etc.), you'll find this very interesting. I am sure we will see more good things from Drew again."
3,2-CD set of Rach four piano concertos,"Would have been a great purchase except for the fact that CD #1 is unusable--it has a prominent surface scratch that prevents continued playing--VERY DISAPPOINTING, since CD #2 is fine."
3,"Great work, but CDs mixing lets it down.","These CDs features some of the greatest piano work ever created - Thats the good news! The bad news is that this recording has the worst MIXING job I think Ive ever heard on a classical CD.It's not the quality of the recording so much as that the dynamic range is terrible (ie. The highs of the pieces are too close to the lows).Then the biggest problem is that the piano is drowned out of the mix by the rest of the symphony for most of the performances (take note of the 3rd Concerto...it's a travesty to miss such finger-work!).So there you have it. Find yourself another recording, I only wish I had another to recommend..."
4,Ashkenazy playing Rach,"Ashkenazy playing Rachmaninov has been always wonderful. Despitethis is a very good cycle, his collaboration with Haitink was moretouching and much more convincent. For Rach played by Ashkenazy, gofor Haitink."
2,Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos,"The quality of the recording is questionable - production of the disk is poor. I was very disappointed with the recording. I am very fond of the performer and the orchestra, however, I expected a good quality recording."
3,"Great Names in Classical Music, but not the best performances","For price, this is one of the better sets of the complete Rachmaninov concertos to own. This set is a safe set to own if you are not familiar with the works. Andre Previn a notable pianist and conductor conducts the London Symphony Orchestra with Vladimir Ashkenazy at the piano. Ashkenazy is widely considered to be one of the great pianists of our time. All performances are better than average, but there are far better individual performances of these concertos. I recommend Piano Concerto No. 1 with Krystian Zimmerman and Seiji Ozawa, Concerto No. 2 with Benno Moiseiwitcsh and William Kapell with Hugo Rignold and William Steinberg conducting respectively. For Concerto No. 3 I recommend Horowitz with Reiner."
4,Wonderful CD,"I love Vladimir Ashkenazy, his music always brings a romantic feeling to me. Most of the time it is fine in playing Russian composer's fieces. However, I think it is ""misplaced"" in Rachmaninov piano Concento #2, which supposes to display a dark side of the emotions, and the struggle of the mind. The first movement is slow, to me a little bit ""dull"", it is like a zepher instead of a storm passing by. I prefer Van Cliburn's powerful and passionate play in this piece. But still I enjoy this CD very much, it is a nice plus to my selections."
4,All very good performances,"These are all very fine perfomances by Ashkenazy and Previn. There also aren't any problems with the sound to my ear and in fact I really like the particular sound of Ashkenazy's piano in this recording. The only drawback lays in the 2nd and 3rd concerti, which, while perfectly played, lack the spontaneity and passion of other recordings. I'd take Argerich any day over Ashkenazy in the 3rd. Also of note, Askenazy chooses the slower, chordal cadenza in the 3rd, which suits his interpretation well but detracts from the concerto's overall charm. This cd was my first classical cd and it's a great place to start with Rachmaninov. These performancse aren't definitive, but are still excellent and come at a good price."
2,Disappointed int this product,"I purchased this product hoping it would help remove excess water from our courts.I followed the accompanying instructions stating hang-up the sponge roller between usages. When I went to use it for the second time to soak up a puddle of water on the court, it failed miserably. All that occurred was the water was just pushed around the court."
3,Defective manufacture,"The roller works just fine until it comes time to replace the roller. The rod that holds the roller is about 1 inch too short. After I pried out the pins holding the rod in place, the arms that held it sprung apart. I had to put the thing in a vice to bend the arms enough to get the pins back in. It took about half an our of careful bending not to overdo it. I do not know how they manufactured this thing as it would have had to be under a lot of pressure to squeeze the arms in enough to get the pins in. I bought two of these. I hope the other one is better. I am not ready to take it apart yet and find out."
5,Jilted John,"This CD is worth the price just for the absolutely bizarre track by Jilted John. Try and have a listen of it or just damn well buy it! Bizarre and so incredibly funny, I couldn't stop laughing when I first heard it and I still laugh each time I play it. It's a masterpiece."
4,I am really looking forward to this...,"I am really looking forward to this game. It will take the tony hawk's 2 and make it extremely better. however, the demo i've seen had some major freaking choppiness and almost ruinded the experience. The keyboard is also no excuse for a dual shock 2, and that really makes the playstation 2 version so much better. However, the computer edition is still a must-buy. Huge interactive levels, online play, and a park editor. damn fine."
4,Tony 3 ROX,"THSP 3 is another great addition to the THPS line. With enhanced multiplayer modes like Graffiti, Trick Attack, King of the Hill, and Slap!. Career ""checklist"" changes for what trick style your skater has. A better create-a-skater to change gender, height, and change more about the pros. They took out Bob Burnqust(I think that's how you spell it) and added Bam Margera. You can do different combos like double and triple kickflips, heelflips and impossobles. You don't win money, but, like in #1, there are stat points and new decks. There are many more special tricks to choose from, also. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the skate park editor is really a step backwards. There are not as many options as THPS 2. Regardless, this is a great game!"
2,gets boring soooooo fast,"i played thps2 for about a year.. it was so fun for abour 10 months,,,then it got boring... then i thought that this game is gonna bring the fun back to it. NOPE. once u bored urself with a tony hawk game nothing is gonna change that. I played this game for about 3 days then stopped..1. this game is easy, i beat it with kareem kamble, geoff rowly, and bucky lasick, each took me about 2 hours.2. u can do double kickflips and other tricks u cant in thps23. neversoft made it so with each player the stat points and stuff are at different place so u will play it with every player, didnt work.4. dont buy this game if u already played thps25. Those 2 stars are because of the level canada which is awesome"
4,I am still excited at having got this vcr at such a price,"The same vcrs are selling in local stores for over 100.00 to have got mine at the price listed made me more than happy even before vcr arrived..Upon reciving the vcr the kids took it over and i have 4 boys so if it can last through them then i would say it has been put to the test..And we have had no problems what so ever out of it...I have to admit it is not a 4 head but knew that when buying but for a standard 2 head vcr it does realy well great picture wonderful onscrean programing and guess what guys how you couldnt plug cable in back before they have gotten smart and made a cut out on the side that cable goes into the back and it is so much easier to plug/screw the cable in now..that was a big plus all on its own,,,so if had to do over again i would not hessitate to buy this great vcr again"
1,absolute junk,"Couldn't be more unreliable. It malfunctions frequently, mangling tapes, sometimes severely. If you value your tapes, don't even think about this one."
4,6-7/10,"i like flip skateboards but, it didnt come with griptape! wtf?! and the bearings where to hard to put in the wheels so i had to smash them in...not good.. not good i would suggest getting a different flip board."
2,"Slick idea, poor audio quality and user interface","Having bought a Siemens phone system for a 500 person company, I expected great quality and features and bought the full 4-handset system. I was disappointed. The audio quality is poor, there is lots of interference (especially from the microwave), dropped calls even with good signal, a brain-dead user interface (who thought up using the MEM key for call waiting?), lousy speakerphone with no volume control...I could go on. The user manual emphasizes all kinds of esoteric features but one has to really dig for several of the basics of operation. For example, the fact that the MEM key was for call waiting was not on the quick reference page, nor was there a page at all for call waiting! One positive: I have had excellent battery performance unlike several other reviewers. Bottom line though: Keep looking, wish I had...."
3,Very Nice Phone When It Works,"Certainly some polarized views on this phone.While mine was working, I really liked it. Sound quality was fine, no interference with 802.11b, good range (3,200 sq ft 2-story house with thick walls), quite easy to understand the menus, some very nifty features (especially like the speakerphone), and attractive styling (to be honest the Panasonic's cheap looks alone rule it out for me).However, my base unit stopped working within a week. So I'll return this phone (to the store, not to Siemens) for a new one, and take my chances. Usually I find that electronics either break quickly or last a long time, and I'll gamble that the base unit does so as well. I might buy the extended warranty as well.So, a mixed review."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I purchased this phone less than a year and a half ago and now it simply stopped functioning. Customer service disclaims any responsibility since it is over a year old. For the price that I paid, I feel this product and service associated with it is a ripoff!"
1,Not worth the cost!,"I have had this product for a little over a year. It does not hold up well. In addition to being difficult to program, the sound quality is deteriorating and the keypad on all of the handsets have become difficult to use. I sincerely regret having purchased with product."
1,Eurotrash,"My wife and I bought this phone shortly after having our place remodeled with very high expectations. The phone is nicely styled, has some terrific features and the multiple handset feature really sounded attractive. Unfortunately, the phone was initially delivered with dead batteries -- a harbinger of things to come. We have had to replace our base unit twice in nine months (it shorted out) despite new phone and electrical wiring in the house and surge protection. Dealings with Siemens customer service have proven to particularly frustrating...."
1,The base station fails!,"We had our phone for just a year when the base station failed. After doing some research, we learned that this is a very common problem with this phone. As a ""courtesy"" the manufacturer agreed to replace the base station after we returned ours by mail, but considering what we have learned, we expect that this will fail again.The phone has lots of features, including a good directory. The speakerphone sound quality is good. The sound quality using the handset is average--sometimes hissy, sometimes tinny.Overall, the phone is a little cumbersome to use--not really intuitive. If you tend to rest the handset on your shoulder when you talk, you will disconnect, because of the way the handset is designed.I definitely do not recommend this phone. I was not terribly happy with it when it was working, but now I know that it has a history of problems. Do your research before purchasing this!We will try the Uniden TRU-5685-2 (?) instead."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I had this phone for about six months and the transmitter in the base went out, making the whole system useless. I called Siemens support and they said there is nothing they can do about it. I must purchase a whole new unit - no way to get a replacement part. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Base unit has failed twice,Its been just over a year since I purchased the base and two extra handsets. The base has now failed on me twice. The first time Siemens replaced it (they made me send it back to them before they would send me another one - leaving me without a phone system for 4 weeks). This time (14 months from original purchase and 4 months from replacement) they tell me that the base is no longer under warranty and I'll have to buy a new one.
2,Online manual found - still hate the phone!,"Did want to add that I found the manual for this phone online. However, I still find the telephone hard to use. I'm passing on the phone and manual to a friend who is working on her doctorate in instructional technology (for real). Perhaps she can find it more ""user friendly"" than I did."
1,Handset and Base Failure,"To start, when this phone system works properly, it is very nice. The sound quality is fine, ergonomics are good, and there are plenty of features. To set up the phone properly and utilize all of the features it takes someone not intimidated by technology.Unfortunately after 12 months ownership, both of the handsets failed. The keypads stopped working so you could not dial out or hang up. Out of warranty I replaced them with two new handsets. 6 months later the base failed. When I called Siemens customer support to ask for help, they claimed a failure rate of < 1%. Of course, being out of warranty, they wouldn't consider replacing the base. On my original purchase the Siemens product failure rate is now 100%."
1,worst cordless phone experience ever,"I bought the siemens based on the company reputation and the features / price comparison.The base station unit easily recognizes all units, and the phone system is very easy to set up. However I've experienced horrible reception with many snaps, crackles. More frustrating is that it frequently and intermittently disconnect during calls.Reception and drop-offs did not seem to be related to distance from the base unit. I may have experienced these problems due to the fact i'm running a wireless network in my house; there have been many comments elsewhere about 2.4G phones interfering with wireless lands. However, turning off the Wireless lan temporarily did not improve phone reception.i lived with the sub-par performance of the siemens for a few months and could never get it to improve. Finally my household forced me to purchase a different phone system. I moved to a 5.8G phone from another vendor and have experienced no problems."
2,Just plain aggravating,"Spent too much time researching cordless phones ended up going with this one given that it appeared to have the most positive reviews. Have owned it for about 5 months along with an extra headset. Bottom line this phone is poorly conceived and engineered and just plain aggravating at times. There is almost a constant buzzing sound in the background (I am not running a WIFI network), the controls on the handset are very complicated (way more so than even the most ""advanced"" cell phone) and I consider myself a technofile. I just wanted a high quality cordless phone that had a good signal, battery life, looked good and was free of defects what I got was a phone with questionable sound quality and a need for a PHD to figure out how it works. For those of you with a temper save yourself from eventually chucking this phone at the wall and look elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this phone,This phone is complete junk. I wouldn't use this phone if someone gave it to me for free. People who like this phone from other reviews think it looks cool (that's all I can gather). It has a bunch of features that are clumsy and annoying.Cons1. Are slow to get to (the menus and pushing buttons)2. Voice dialing? what a joke. It isn't true voice dialing3. The clarity was awful. It sounded like I was on a CB radio. One reason it might have been bad is because I have a 2.4GHZ wireless router; though my Panasonic sounds crystal clear.Pros1. Looks cool2. They really tried with the features... tried...3. Looks cool
2,Everything EXCEPT Comfort,"`This phone is truelly amazing with all of its features. It even calls itself "" The handset that has it all!"" Well if it has it all, then why in the world would it not be headset compatible. It even comes with a belt clip. It's like they just forgot to add that feature when it went into production. The phone is much to hard and uncomfortable to hold up to my ear, or on my shoulder for any length of time. I am very frustated at having to return this phone because i have not seen any others with this many bells and whistles. If Siemens would have either made this phone more comfortable or had preferably added headset capability, I believe that it would be the best phone on the market. But without either of these, I am dissapointedly having to return this phone."
1,Two thumbs down!,"I bought this phone just over a year ago. Base phone plus one additional headset. Overall my recommendation is to STAY AWAY from this product, particularly at this price. It looks good on paper, i.e., long on feature, very short on performance. My additional headset died within the first year -- the LCD display didn't work at all, problems registering to the base set, etc. The sound quality is much worse than my 900MHz phone of a few years ago. I've tried moving the phone location, etc., but nothing seems to have worked. Using the phone initially is not very intuitive -- definitely need the manual for simple things sucha s turnign the ringer off, or muting!"
2,"No volume button, no flash button","When you're talking and want to change the handset volume, you have to interrupt your conversation so you can look at the display, then press menu, scroll down to handset volume, and perform a few more steps to change the volume. Ridiculous. It needs a regular volume control. Same thing with call waiting. There is no flash button. You have to go through the menu system to switch to the waiting call."
1,If you want a phone for display and not for use ...,"The phone looks sleek and has state of the art features. The problem: Poor battery life. It detriorates to a point where the battery lasts less than 20 mins on talk and less than 5 mins on speakerphone. The phone is a nice showpiece to keep in the living room but you should buy another phone to use :). I have exchanged this twice from Siemens. Siemens customer service is very nice. They have sent me replacement batteries twice and exchanged the machine twice. But, the machine has problems so what can you do?"
2,Never again,"I bought this phone for the look and multitude of features, however, there are too many features. After 6 months, I still need to refer to the owners manual for certain things. The quality is okay, but don't talk on the phone when the microwave is on. The handset speaker is the best feature. Also, the voice recognition was cool, until my [child] decided to start using it. If you don't say names the same way each time, it calls someone else. I don't like the extreme lightweight feel to it, makes it feel [inexpensive] and fragile. The battery life was fine in the beginning, but now only lasts about 1-2 hours off the base. Not good when there is no handset locator feature. With everything compacted into this phone, you would think it at least had that! Don't think I'll ever buy this name brand again. So far, Uniden's been the best for ease of use and durability."
3,User thoughts,"I think it is OK but my wife does not. Voice clarity not as good as land line, but no wireless is. I think the worst feature is the small screen, need to wear your glasses to read it. Also, you have to scroll to get to the names of callers. All the unit puts up in the 1st instance is the telephone number. Sooo, you need an encyclopedic memory for this feature to have practical value."
4,Awesome Phone,"I love the phone, it is small, lightweight, the battery lasts for a long time, and it has a lot of kewl gadget features. The only down side (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that it has no jack for a headset. One would think that for a hundred dollars that they could put a headset jack in it.Other than that though the phone is awesome. I read a lot of the reviews before buying it and found a lot of them simply absurd. Especially the one complaining about the batteries not comming fully charged. I still bought it though and I am very happy with it; except for the feature I already mentioned. As far as the 'call waiting' goes. I find Call Waiting insulting when I call my friends so I am not that concerned about it.If you are like me? this is a great phone to get, though if the headset thing is really important, then do some more research. :)"
3,"Good features, fair to poor sound quality","Th features on this phone are addictive - Multiple ring types, speakerphone on the handset, screen messages on the handset, but the sound quality is poor and there is no handset locator button on the base. When you raise the handset volume, the S/N ratio goes way down (alot of air/hissing in the background). In addition, the sound cuts in and out as you carry on a conversation, almost like a speaker phone would, except you're not on speakerphone. I want to like this phone, but I just can't do it. 3 stars is generous."
4,voice recognition is great,"I like the voice dialing feature on this. I've always been bad with remembering numbers but can always remember a person's name or face. I guess I'm not a numbers kind of person.In any event, this phone is great. Unlike other cordless phones, this one has a decent range (I can go all over my house without it dropping the call), excellent battery life, and great clarity and always free from interference. My previous 900 mhz cordless phone was always experiencing interference, so this is a great change."
4,Great Features,I just got this phoneGreat phone with these exceptions:1) slow response of the keys (or commands)2) noise which i think is because i'm using a wireless network on the same freq. 2.4ghzGood:1) voice commands work really well2) dedicated key for voice mail even though it has a built in answering machine3) nice grip4) SPEAKER PHONE ON THE HAND SET ! which is not only monitor you could actually talk5) AA batteries... supplied is 700mah i put 1600mah should last for at least a week.Thats all i think.
2,Poor customer support,"1. This phone works fine but the battery life is very short. We've had the phone of about 40 days and the batteries won't hold a charge. I called Siemens and was told (both by the customer service agent and the manager) that they don't warrantee the battery. In my view, a battery that fails after just 40 days is defective, not worn out. I ended up having to purchase new batteries. I can't trust a company that won't stand behind its products.2. I found the directions vague, confusing and contradictory. I had to fiddle with the phone for about two days to get it set up properly."
1,If you want a phone that breaks buy this one,"I spend over [$$] on their top of the line model. At first I thought this is great. My friends bought similar models and for the first six months I was happy. Then the buttons on all the handsets started to not work. By the time the problem had become intolerable the warranty had expired. I was told by Customer care that I could buy another one referbished. Wow, what a great deal....Spend more money on their cheaply made technology...Don't Buy From Siemens."
2,Short battery life,Great features and design except for the battery life. It started out great and has deteriorated to the point that it only lasts about 40 minutes. My sister has the same phone and the same problem. She even exchanged it thru Siemens twice and the same thing.
2,I Almost Forgot...,"Me again, the VERY WORST feature: HOW DO YOU GET CALL WAITING?I have tried in vain to anser the call-waiting, and I end up running into the other room, grabbing my PANASONIC phone, switching to that one, and THEN pressing ""FLASH"" which seamlessly leads me to the other call. I dont understand why Siemens can't put a flash button on this phone. If you want to show off, get a B&O phone, they at least function for all that they cost."
2,Seimens 4215 Gigaset,"The phone and handsets have been a big disappointment. The reception has been very poor with a constant ""clicking"" which is very annoying during conversations. The key action is very unresponsive and the caller ID function is poor compared to the much less expensive ATT phone we replaced .The concept of multiple handsets located around the home is great but the phones shortcomings make this one to avoid."
2,Headphone jack failed,"I have had two handsets, having replaced the first one after the headphone jack stopped working after three years. The replacement handset, now three years old also has a malfunctioning headphone jack. I used to love to use the belt clip and my headphones to take conference calls at home and not have have my hands free to use the PC, etc. After two failed handsets, I would not buy this product again."
2,"Great, But Poor Quality for an Expensive PHone","I purchased a 4215 base and 2 additional handsets and we really like the system. However, the base failed today (after 2 years of service). Customer service at Siemens was prompt and professional -- they answered the phone immediately and were able to help me troubleshoot the problem quickly. HOWEVER, SIEMENS WARRANTY IS 1 YEAR AND THEY SELL NO REPLACEMENT PARTS. I WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE A NEW HANDSET AND BASE AT THE STORE. I'M UPSET THAT A ""HIGH-END"" SYSTEM LIKE THIS FAILS AFTER 2 YEARS AND WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER GIVEN THE SIMILAR FAILURES THAT OTHERS NOTE IN THESE REVIEWS. I will never buy another Siemens product."
2,Good Looking Disappointment,"I bought the phone without doing a lot of research and it has been a major disappointment. Other than the sleek headset I don't have anything good to say about it. There are 2 reasons why I'm really upset with the purchase. #1 the volume on the headset is very low. Compared to my old phone I have trouble hearing people. #2 the battery life is the worst of any cordless I have ever owned. If you don't leave the phone in the base the batteries will be dead within a couple of days on standby, if you talk on the phone or not. If you are considering buying this phone I would suggest you keep looking"
3,"It was staged, but it was fun","The wrestling between jerry lawler and andy kaufman was all staged or 'worked' as they say in the business, but it is fun to see again. the interviews with other celebrities make it seem real and of course jerry lawler is used to this type of acting. kaufman took to the theater of it as he did with everything with a real enthusiasm. there is one part of this dvd that was not part of the wrestling events. when kaufman speaks to the camera looking shaken and talks about being hurt by 'all of this'. that was actually after he was thrown off of the tv show Fridays for not cooperating. if you liked kaufman or pro wrestling this is worth a look"
3,"Okay, but not comedy as you know it","Interesting, but more as a portrait of a performance artist than a comedy. Best for the kaufman completists."
3,great game...i just wish i could get it to work properly,i can't get it to work completely...i mean i get to play a few levels and then it just says it stopped working...so if you have vista...don't get this game...it won't work...i've tried multiple times.if you have another system...i highly recommend this game... it's really fun. and the camera isn't that bad...it's like tomb raider 4 and 5... and that never seemed to bother me.
5,Spider Man's best yet,"Much improved from the last game, this is great! There are so many secret areas to find and combos to try out and enemies to beat. I love this game, I think Activision did a great job on improving it."
2,Controls are major problem,"I echo previous reviewers complaints about the controls. Really, really frustrating, especially since the graphics are so nice (gamma adjustment is needed though). Seems like they ported from console to the PC in a big hurry."
5,Seems a lifetime to make.,"This game is so awesome and yet it seems it would take forever to make. Because you can play as three different thugs, Shocker, Scientist, Harry the Green Goblin and more. It seems impossible to make. The razor-bat level is the biggest problem for the people whom made it. This game is awesome but hard to make. Buy it and see for yourselves."
2,THUMBS DOWN,First graphics are awesome.....everything else is a let down. My PC is a P4 1.7G with 256RDRAM and Geforce 3 Ti 200 card with 128DDR. This game locks up and freezes after about 10 min!! So I downloaded Activision's 1.1 patch....now it freezes after 5 min. !!!!! Might as well use the discs as drink coasters now!! Like one reviewer said it was [a great price] so I bought it....now I know why it was [low-priced]!!! I probably can't return it to the store so I'll call Activision for a return authorization.On the box it said my card would support it....as it should bacause every other new game I have plays flawlessly. DON'T BUY IT UNLESS YOU HAVE THE LATEST AND FASTEST VIDEO CARD!!! STAY AWAY!!
1,Good luck getting this to work with your video card!,"I have an NVidia GeForce 200 MX 32 Mb PCI video card. This met the reqts written on the product packaging. I get an error that my card doesn't support ""TNL"" when I run the game. The Activision support site knowledge-base says this is because *pre*-GeForce cards will not work. Well, I have a GeForce card! Their support site has a link to nVidia. NVidia's site says their GeForce family of cards all support TNL!!! What gives??? I bought the game, it doesn't work, and I can't return it. THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME!"
2,Outdoor = good. Indoor = bad. Bad guys have weapons. WHAT?,"After watching a friend play this game and playing a little myself, it looked sweet. When I got it however, I found it far too challenging, even on the easiest setting. Question: WHERE IN THE MOVIE DO ANY OF THE BAD GUYS CARRY GUNS AND WHERE ARE THE ROBOTS THAT SHOOT MISSILES AT YOU? Answer: NOWHERE. So why put them in the game? Spidey really doesn't have a good enough defense for either of these and both do way too much damage. Also, they should have had more city levels where you swing from the sky around buildings and less indoor fighting levels."
3,"Too violent for children, should be teenager or above","The graphics are great, commands are exciting for teenagers and above. Definitely NOT a game for younger children. We experienced our child getting violent and trying to practice the moves that appear on the game. In our opinion the rating agency did a POOR job. We REMOVED the game from the computer and hid the game away from our child."
3,Warning: Incompatible with many standard graphics cards,"Upon launch this game does a hardware check of your graphics card to see if it is ""TNL"" compatible. If it isn't, you won't be playing this game. Period. There are no options and no workarounds. During installation, ""Spider-Man: The Movie"" displays a very short list of compatible video cards. Find a copy of that list and make sure your card is on it. To be fair Activision does mention some of this in its minimum system requirements, but if you're not up on your tech-talk to know what ""Full Transform and Lighting"" is--or if your system has it, you'd better do some research before spending 50 bucks."
5,Blindsided help me when I needed help,"The Book of Job is a difficult book to understand, especially when one is looking for answers. ""Blindsided"" offers a down to earth, logical explanation to the trials and frustrations that we all encounter. This book is not only for pastors and professors, it is for all of us who are looking for answers."
1,Not worth your time,This DVD is basicly a highlight of all the Superbowls. The problem is you get only two plays from each Superbowl and many of them aren't even the greatest moments. It's definetly a waste time.
1,flying under false colors,"This book has VERY little to do with elearning. In fact, it is a very watered down Dreamweaver MX tutorial. There is virtually nothing about elearning in the body of the book. It does have one ""extra credit"" appendix which deals, albeit very briefly and in a pretty general sense (approximately 28 pages), with coursebuilder and learningsite. I am extremely disappointed with the content of this book. Not much bang for your buck for a fairly expensive book!"
5,Must Read!,A fascinating look at historical fiction! This is different than anything I've ever read. Terrific!
2,Not that good,"I bought this album expecting to listen to hardcore Latin House as would be expected from Johnson and from a club like El Divino but all I got was chillout lounge style music.If you like that type of music listen to a couple of tracks before buying it because 34 dollars is way too much for this low quality album.I gave it 2 stars because a couple of tracks were pretty good, but the rest of the album was pure trash."
2,Vandalism,"Ashkenazy alters not only Chopin's vital rhythms but the very notes Chopin wrote. These are Chopin's mazurkas as rewritten by Ashkenazy. I should say, as butchered by Ashkenazy."
2,"Hello, Anybody home ?","Its got to be one of the worst chopin mazurka recording i've ever heard , It feels like chopin is on a break and put a sign 'will be right back' , I waited for something to happend but no.try Barenboim or Rubinstein."
2,Does Harriet Klausner Dislike ANY Book?,"Honestly, how Harriet Klausner can give this book 4 stars is beyond me; but this seems to be her basic pattern, no matter how good or bad the book, she seems to rate them all well. Which doesn't help readers who want an unbiased, realistic review from someone we want to trust.The hero, Alexander de Monteneau was perfect in my opinion, but his heroine wasn't. He deserved a better woman and a more interesting story. She wasn't happy with her lot in life, which was understandable, but Alex was pretty much on her side only she was too obnoxious to realize it."
2,Had Such Potential....,"Alex was the only interesting thing about this book, but even he wasn't enough to carry this dull tale to its conclusion. And Talia wasn't a very good heroine. She was smart enough, but so bratty in other ways; too childish for Alex."
5,Why Doesn't This Classic Have Complete Sesaons On DVD Yet?,"Beauty and the Beast is a great TV show. They used to show syndicated reruns of this show on some cable station but then they dropped the show from their schedule. I thought that Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton were great as Vincent and Catherine and the rest of the cast was great too, especially Roy Dotrice as Father, Armin Shimerman as Pasquale and I also liked the kid who played Mouse and I want to see this put on DVD in complete season sets!"
5,PLEASE release this on DVD,I grew up watching this show and loved every episode. I've been trying to find them for years. Ron Perlman is amazing as Vincent and the actor who played Father was everything a kid could want. You really rooted for Perlman and Hamilton. PLEASE release this series on DVD.
4,A great retelling of a timeless story,I would have given it Five stars but it's the 80's for God's sake. I hope they bring it up to date and bring back Catherine.
2,Try another brand,Ordered these last time. I was disappointed to see that they were set to expire less than two months after I received them. Not a lot of time to eat or sell them!Taste was ok. Had a sour taste which makes them not quite as good as some of the others I've tried.

1,Not Harry at his best,"This album was recorded in Harry's living room and is not a serious piece of work. Harry was making some really good studio records around this time so it appears this one was just Harry goofing around at home. If you want to hear some fantastic music, get one of Harry's professionally produced CD's like Who Put The Benzedrine or Everybody's Crazy But Me. Get this one last."
3,it works.,"this barcode scanner works alright, it isnt the best ever, but its ok. Bonus points because it is shapped like a cat."
5,MUSIC-MAKING AT ITS BEST,"I have the previously released CD of this music by this conductor, on the London Weekend Classics label. This kind of music-making is simply magic. Fritz Reiner, who feels just at ease with the Hungarian Dances as he does with a Dvorak symphony, really puts his heart and mind in the music and gives us the best version of these works I have ever heard. Especially effective is the Hungarian Dance no. 6 in D major - if this music does not make you want to dance, then there is either something wrong with me or the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra."
3,BBQ construction,"The version I saw was like a home movie production. Sadly, the construction methods and finish were somewhat of a ""weekend warrior"" caliber. That being said, the methods of BBQ construction shown are fairly standard. Any viewer or contractor with years of contruction experience should be able interpret the methods in the video and improve on them and come up with a fairly good product."
4,Déjà Vu Africa addio,"I first read this book shortly after it's availability in the US. I re-read it after the horrors of the Rwanda genocide. The 1966 book was simply a forecast of what was to come 30 years in the future. Compelling reading, not for the faint of heart or those who do not wish to have nightmare images of a land gone mad."
3,Nice but not quite convenient,It ia a very rugged case but as such does not fit well in my pockets. The case also makes it almost impossible to take the stylis out of the palm unless you take the palm out of the case. It is not a flip cover even though that is what they call it - it dosn't flip at all and has a bad habit of closing over the screen when i use the palm in it. It attaches with velcro but it seems to be easier to just toss the palm in and zip it up. I am a little dissapointed with it but for protecting the palm when traveling it works quite well.
1,Not user friendly,"I just returned my palm glove case. I tried it for a whole day. It is rather difficult to operate getting the palm pilot out of the case to use it while its on your belt. The velcro was way to difficult to deal with. The belt loop should be a belt clip, to take it on and off easier!This case was totally unhelpful for easy access. I hope to find a leather case with a belt clip on it."
4,Very handy case!,"This case is really nice. The color is quite nice, and the zipper hasnt ever cought up on itself yet. Though it is a plastic zipper, it holds snugly. I do not like the velcro strap inside tohold the unit in. I would have prefereed a locking system to hold it in place, but the velcro does do the job well. Wearing on my side, I have never broken my M105 yet, and I've accidentally bashed it a few times, with no damage to the inside either. The EVA Rubber sure is nice too, meaning the case will always look like new even after you smash it with your foot. (but DO take your palm out FIRST! hehe)The time button doesnt work though if you use the clip-on face protector that usually comes with the 100 series, but if you wear it on your belt, you have to take it out anyway to see the time.. hehe.A great product, well worth the cost."
1,Dumbed down + violence,"Take the movie _Deliverance_, add the movie _Apocalypse Now_, dumb down both to the level of the pre-pubescent, add titilating, gratuitous violence that does nothing for the plot (e.g., a rape scene of woman by ""Ray""), subtract all intelligibility and coherence from the plot, add Hollywood sensationalizing, and you get something resembling what the cat threw up after a wild night in the alley. Don't watch this unless you're a substandard teenage male."
1,Terrible movie,Had several people recommend this movie. It is one of the worst movies I HAVE EVER SEEN. DON'T BUY IT. WASTE OF MONEY
2,Crab Shells,"These would be good if you had a really small Hermit Crab,But for my Hermit Crab they were way to small. Would not recommend for a normal size Hermit Crab."
1,Way too small,I should of listened to the other feedback. These shells should be labeled small because thats what they are. They are no way medium sized. Do not buy if you have a hermit crab that is slightly bigger than a small sized one. These shells will not work.
3,Not all shells were medium,I was a little disappointed when I received this product that all of the shells weren't medium in size as described. The small ones are no use to me. My crabs are too big for them.
2,wrong size stated,"I bought the medium sized shell as the extra large was way too big for our hermit crabs. On the details it stated medium sized, but when the package arrived it was 2 small shells and 1 medium. The price is great considering our only local pet shop wants $25.00 for one shell! I guess I will have to take a risk on buying the large shell- as it is still cheaper than the local pet store!!"
2,Item doesn't match description,"The description says this is a package of medium shells, what I received was a package labled small and medium. The package says they measure 1/2"" to 1"" but all three of mine were closer to 1/2"" to 3/4"". I don't think it will work for my crab. So disappointing."
3,When preparing for Armageddon......,"When comparing Carnivore to Peter Steele's latter band, Type O Negative, it is easy to note a vast progression both musically and lyrically. However, die hard fans will find some valuable rarities within this little collection. Carnivore has the thrashy and somewhat melodic punk sound that was temporarily adopted on Type O Negative's first release, slow deep and hard. The song God Is Dead is the stand with its chaotic verses and sudden calm and melodic chorus, that is reminicent of Too Late.There is no question about it, this is nothing to take seriously. Carnivore is essentially a testosterone driven piece of chaos with little musical ambition and profoundly stupid lyrics."
4,I love it,"One of the funniest episodes of the third season, is the Romantic Weekend. When Martin, Tisha, Tichina, and Tommy come face to face with a ""puppy"" and Martin and Tichina were trying to beat it down."
4,Still funny,"Martin is still funny after all of these years. More silly than anything, but good for a laugh. It is refreshing to see a good goofy show that doesn't rely on on sex or offensive language."
3,"Good to have on CD, but where are the DOUBLE PLAY mixes?!!","OK, like everyone else, I am happy to finally have SIDEKICKS (aka QUICK STEP AND SIDEKICK) back in print on CD in the U.S. - BUT seeing as I paid mucho dollars $$$ to buy an original OOP CD version on ebay recently, and now THIS budget version appears, I wish they saw fit to include all of the mixes from the U.S. ""Double Play"" cassette-only release - I remember buying it when it first came out and playing it sooo much it literally fell apart! We need ALL the remixes of Lies, Love Lies Bleeding, and especially LONG BEACH CULTURE - wow! Still, this is a nice addition to anyone's CD collection. Count me in, reluctantly. JUDY DO rocks!"
2,A tough read for even a devoted history buff...,"I'm a huge Pacific war buff so I'm probably the perfect audience for this book and yet I cannot get through it. Every few months, I'll go back to it but this book doesn't have a heartbeat...it's all troop movements and unit designations and no ""feel"". I'm all for good history which undoubtedly this is, but I also want to enjoy myself and I don't when reading this book. This book reads like an after action report. I don't ""know"" any of the protagonists and I don't get the sounds and smells of the place like I do from heart poundingly well written military history.Someone like a Halberstam (r.i.p.), please write the book we all want about Guadalcanal and use this as a fantastic source."
2,Academic,"This was a comprehensive collection of statistics and War Department strategy notes but it had no life. It gave no feel for the soldier, sailor or marine on the ground. It was all acronyms and big picture strategy. If you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle. Since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war, the participants should get more ink. Here, the brass get all the attention."
4,"Integration of the Land, Air and Sea Elements of Gaudalcanal","An outstanding, comprehensive account of the Guadalcanal campaign. Mr. Frank effectively integrates the Land, Air and Naval elements of the campaign, giving credit and blame for success and failure where it is due. He is also good at pointing out how one Admiral's fortune could easily have been his shame had events deviated even slightly. The book is a must for Naval Historians and for Naval Surface Warfare Officers to understand our heritage and how the blue water and brown water navies are tied much closer than we imagine."
5,Guadalcanal - The Definitive Account,This is an outstanding work that details the details of that bloody campaign. It helped me view the island's challenges from both sides and also knitted together the naval battles with the ground campaign. I will treasure this book for the rest of my life.
4,Frank has a mastery of the facts.,"I am disheartened to see that this book has not received more attention. The book is a masterful mix of facts and suspense in which ships, careers and battalions are squandered. Frank unfolds the battle nearly week to week tactically and strategically; as the subtititle declares, this is a definitive account of the landmark battle. With such a large selection, it is understandable but unfortuanate to see such a gem be overlooked."
4,The kids love it - just watch your fingers....,"My kids got this from their grandmother and they love it. One thing that gets me though- the top flips over very easily! They have smashed more fingers rocking in it, and moving it from room too room. Warn your kids to keep their fingers well clear of the bottom. However- like I said- they really are enjoying it."
3,A Little More Should be Expected,"Rizzi has a great concept and approach, but she falls short on checking the accuracy of her work. The section on Japanese incense seems poorly researched, leaning too heavily on previous works like Kiyoko Morita."
4,A GREAT cRPG THAT WENT UNNOTICED...,"This is a very good cRPG that, unfortunately, got lost in the wake of the BALDUR's GATE series. Speak to NTCs, uptake quests, complete and increase your character's level; leave no barrel unopened and no beast still breathing, and barter the spoils for better equipment.The story is solid, the items imaginative, the maps and environments well designed and the graphics and sound hold it all together beautifully. The last star was withheld because of some stability issues that persist even with the latest patches.Had this game not been released in BALDUR's GATE wake, it would have had a much brighter trajectory.To all classic cRPG fans out there,RECOMMENDED!!"
3,good complementary book on Frank Lloyd Wright,"This book explored the origin, the life of Frank Lloyd Wright. The author didn't discuss FLW's other works as such but did explain the nature why Taliesin & its other counterpart were built, & unbeknown to the architect would one day become 2 of the most important buildings in the States. The book contained many pictures (good quality) of the communes participating in many subsistence activities, FKW giving guidance to his disciples, lavish parties & performances that were held there, many aspects of those buildings. On the sideline, the book also displayed the graphics that were utilised by the Taliesin Foundation, Asian art works that were collected by FKW during his trip to Japan (in particular). For the benefit of the readers, building plans were enclosed to relate to the pictures provided."
2,a spiritual disappointment,If it's the photos essay I would expect to see better quality of images that could capture the heart of what the author had intended. It has nice title and great attempt. The content could have been much more profound.
4,Good Gift,"I bought this for my 2 year old son and while he is not able to put it together with ease, he has no problem figuring out how to turn on and off the constructs and enjoys attempting to fit the pieces together.My 5 year old enjoys making things as well, but doesn't stick with the toy for more than 10 min."
2,Doesn't stay together,"My 3yo son got this toy as a gift. It's a great idea, and loads of fun to put together in different ways. However, he will put it together, turn it on, and in setting it down to let it run he'll bump something and the pieces fall apart. It is very frustrating to him. Great concept, I just wish the pieces fit together a bit tighter."
5,A Wondrous Compilation,"This has to be one of the best compilations that I have ever listened to. It is great songs like this that defined music of the 1970's. Original artists and recordings, lover's enjoy!"
5,album desciption,"this is my favorite one. its way more unstructured and spread out than the rest. xiao has a lot of space, very spread. you can almost touch the sounds, feel and see the distances. usually the albums have a certain sound or touch to it, but this one is different, everything you hear you can also visualize and feel, its way more organic.the last track ""return of the nose"" is really nice.im glad to say i have this."
1,These guys are losers!,"I saw Wooden Wand and The Vanishing Voice last weekend and they were total jerks. They played at this small venue with a couple other bands, one of which was from the town where they were playing. They were really rude during their performance and threw stuff at the band, plus yelling out rude comments like ""Play quieter so we can talk over your performance"". Then when they were confronted for their behavior they said ""Do you know who we are?"", like they were better than the average human being for being signed onto Kill Rock Stars. I had never seen anything so immature and embarrassing in my life. They have a big fat ego and probably psychological problems. Plus, their music isn't very impressive. Skip this album and look for some good indie rock that's worth your money."
4,Works if you are alone or at a corporate,I bought this book many years ago while I was a sales engineer in a small company.. at first I thought this would be helpful when I someday would be part of a major corp.Now that I do belong to a corp I realice that the principles set here can help you in your personal goals as well.. fun and practical book in the style of a story
5,Excellent Treatment for franchise management per E-myth,"Okay, I bought the book for 50 cents at the local library.So? I believe this book, combined with the book One Page Business Plan will allow you to lead and manage any size business from 0 to 30,000 people.Notice how I used the word ""Treatment"" in the title of this review? Well a treatment is a one to two page document for explaining the plot and timing of a screenplay/tv show--it's peaks/valleys/growth and development. This is a common thing to do in the entertainment industry for a show that's from 30 minutes to 2 1/2 hours long.How long do you want your business to run? Buy both books. Build a better business. Live more life. ;)"
2,"for VERY exiprienced folder, ready to fight for each step","Well, the book is ..., contains interesting models that you will not find anywhere else, BUT: Title absolutly misleading. Even thought it contains several easy models, majority of interesting models are very complex. Even if you could handle it, be aware that: Diagrams are awful and I would like to emphasize it: every model contains a steps that are difficult to follow , from misleading to sometimes erroneous, imcomplete - some very complex steps are just sketched and you will not even see a result picture on next one, text description of steps is very pure. May be that is what autor wanted to say in the title: you will fight for every step to find out what is drawn here. I would recomend it to buy only for VERY expirienced folder who loves to solve puzzles."
1,Does not work with DSC-W530 USB Camera!,"This is the FIRST item to come up on Amazon when you search ""DSC-W530 USB Cable"". However, it does NOT fit this camera. I am baffled as to why it's even listed and wished their search functions worked better.Again, this cable does NOT work with the DSC-W530 USB camera."
4,Glorified Magna Doodle,"My six year old used her own money for this, and although she is having fun with it, she thinks she could have gotten more for her money. It will probably be used on an upcoming car trip, and perhaps the addition of some of the software (although a few of the titles already seem to young for her)will help it see more use. Otherwise, not as fun and less creative than markers and paper (and more expensive). Getting enough pictures made to use the animation software can be tedious, but rewarding. Fun toy but not a great value."
4,"Good Toy, Bad Planning","My daughter loved the toy for a while. But she is left handed and it is very difficult to use as the pen is attached at the top right corner so in order to click and point (to use it), you cover the screen and the string barely reaches this way. The picture is a tad fuzzy, but a 5 year old did not mind. HOWEVER, my daughter tried to change the batteries herself and lost the battery cover. Fisher-Price does not stock replacement parts, so I am out $45. Very frustrating. If you have a computer, CD Rom's are more educational and more cost effective. But the Travel Value (riding in the car/plane) is better with this."
4,Could be better,"I think the overall quality is fine, but my pair has a little discoloring in the leather. I believe these are going to be needing a lot of polish to keep them looking good. The break in time was normal and they do seem sturdy."
3,Escott blames the wrong person,"Paul D. Escott's well researched book refutes its own thesis--that Jefferson Davis was largely responsible for the failure of the Confederacy to coalesce into unified country. What one ultimately realizes is that Escott wanted to blame Davis and disregarded what his own evidence told him, that governors such as Thomas Cobb of Georgia were actively undermining the Confederacy in an attempt to increase their own power over their states.I give the book three stars because it is an excellent resource; anyone seeking a book from which to begin a literature search would be well served to start here. The book gets no higher ranking because of the weakness of his thesis in light of the evidence presented in this book. Indeed, rewriting the first chapter to blame the governors and unwilling citizens of the Confederacy would automatically earn the book five stars."
5,You'll Like this if you Loved...,"Rather than going over the story (which the other reviewers here have done exceedingly well), I will offer this:If you liked/loved Fruits Basket, Kaleidostar, Ouran High School Academy, Miyazaki's works, or Angelic Layer, then you will like/love this series as well.For our family, we have cycled through many anime titles in search of those that have the same combination of addictive qualites as those listed above. This one has landed high on that list - the top 3rd or 4th according to my wife!"
3,Sequel To Sailor Moon but still Good,"I found myself entertained by this series and also found myself followingthe storyline to the end of the series all in all though it also seemed tobe following the path of sailor moon somewhat with the lead hero ""girl""falling for an older somewhat aloof man who claims does not love her butsecretly does and shows his true feelings at the end when he thinks he's losther forever some serious scenes but not by much.The series is thirteen episodes but even if it's short compared to some series it's still worthchecking out"
2,Disappointed customer,"This honey was liquid when it arrived, leaked between the covers and has not hardened enough to be able to spread it.Too expensive for such an experience. The containers are too small to be practical for regular usage. I would not recommend it. Was so looking forward to finding a honey like you can get in Germany. That honey is perfect for spreading on a toast bread, no matter the temperature. If it would have worked out, I would be a loyal customer, this is not the case with this product."
4,Sturdy but,These are nice and sturdy so they don't bend. The shape fits in most spice bottles and tins. I separated them because they're a little heavy. The only thing I don't like about them is that the square handles dig into your hands. They should have rounded the handles.
1,Very amateur,Thank God I only paid $12. Very amateur short films recorded at 30 fps. There is a little of creativity that can be used better on future films with less camera shaking. I understand the effort of filming and editing but is not really awesome.
1,The conversions are incorrect.,"The measurement conversions are incorrect. I had to return it.Check the tablespoon column, for instance."
2,Strong Magnet w/ Error,"The magnet is very strong, and easy to read. The only problem is 3 oz does not equal 79 ml (89), and 5 oz does not equal 158 ml (148). Pretty big mistake when conversion is your only purpose."
3,Order other brands if they have the same info.,Order other brands if they have the same info.The item would be a five star if they did not GLUE it to the cardboard envelope.Not sure what that is all about. It took a while to clean off and I still did not get all of it. I used hot water and WD40
3,Sound and Fury,"The story line of this opera is not a patch on Mefistofele, Boito's other opera.The raucus sound effects are there in overabundance and the melodic lines ar caressing,but the chacters and the story do not tug at us the way the Faust legend does. It is too bad that Boito didn't continue to compose operas. He might have become as popular as Verdi."
5,Perfect,I use this for fishing and works great at getting the hooks out for the fish. A must for all tackle boxes
3,"Incredible compositions, lously sound","This is some of the music from Nosferatu, and Most of the Music on this CD is from Nosferatu. It may be disapointing to some if your are looking for an authentic movie soundtrack. The sound of the CD is quite muddy. You will have to play with the settings on your stereo to bring the sound out. I used to have this on vinyl in the mid 80's, and a cassette I recently discovered in a box containing a couple of the tracks sound BETTER that the CD. BUT...the music, arrangements and performance is not to be ignored. Popul Vuh is an ensemble way ahead of their time. I play sitar, guitar and bass and would be overjoyed to find a few musicians wishing to even attempt such performances. It makes me want to get more of their work, If I could only be sure of better sound quality. Anyway, if you are looking for good sound, pass it by. If you are looking for great music, go for it."
2,Go to Sleep,"This soundtrack was sadly disappointing. I was expecting a faithful soundtrack from the movie-this is not it! There are some eerie songs, but most on this album are the happy ones (which are few in the movie) and are not faithfully recreated. Indeed, the movie's music was by far in comparison on the better part of my imagination and soothing music. The lacking of this soundtrack I made my own copy-straight from the DVD. So I have a 78-minute faithful, and completely questionable, moods for all my devious pleasures. ..."
5,Beautiful and sensitive collection not just for children,"This book has room in its heart for the passions and longings of writers from all of the Middle East. It offers readers, in beautiful poetry, the longings for place, for a loved past, for a more secure future, felt by Lebanese, Syrians, Israelis, Turks, Palestinians, Iraqis, Saudis, Egyptians, and more. Meticulously designed and printed, it offers art from across the Middle East that illuminates these poems and helps us learn with our children important lessons about that part of the world."
5,Great book,Will purchase from this seller again. Shipping was on time and product was in the condition stated in the description.
2,Great design. Chrome fails though.,"Great design. They slide well and don't tend to come off the rod. Nor are they hard on shower curtains. However, with a stainless steel curtain rod, the chrome wore off and they rusted like crazy and caused the stainless curtain rod to accumulate surface rust spots too, as water deposited rust on the bottom surface of it. I had to use coarse stainless steel wool to remove it. I'll upload a picture to demonstrate what a year or two of use resulted in: rust! Granted, I often use my bathroom as a sauna, and these are the first hooks I've that lasted long enough for the chrome to wear off. I'll get some stainless ones instead."
2,looks without function,"I've had these for a few years now and they're not terrible, but they have some very big flaws. Yes, they do occasionally fall off the rod, especially if you whip the curtain back and forth. Fortunately you can't do that much, because they stick on the rod rather than gliding smoothly. I have a white tension rod which now has black all over the top of it from these things rubbing against it. They do look good, but they just don't work so well."
2,"As others say, won't stay on rod","I wanted some new shower curtain hooks to improve on some cheap plastic rings I had. Bought these locally - thought they looked nice but was a little concerned about the hook instead of full loop. I couldn't find any loops, so went ahead with these hooks. Wish I'd read the review here first, because I could not get these to stay on the rod. I tried alternating the direction of the hooks (i.e. having one face in, the next face out) and it helped a bit but 1 or 2 would come off the rod every single time I pulled the curtain open. VERY annoying and frustrating. Thumbs down - I'm going back to full loops. (And why in the world are virtually all the shower curtain hangers I'm seeing in stores now hooks instead of loops? It's maddening.)"
2,A Menace to Any Bathroom,"If you have a guest bathroom that is rarely used, this product adds a nice touch to any décor. However, if you have a bathroom that is in heavy use, these hooks are definitely NOT recommended. Purchase these hooks and you'll find yourself having to reposition them several times a day after they've fallen from the rod. Pull back the curtain too fast and you may even have a more serious mishap."
4,Geno11,"This item is for a heavy duty application, for the light weight curtains, its too much. It was not good for my use."
2,Rusted,"I purchased these shower hooks approximately 2 years ago for my guest bathroom which is rarely used. After a year I have some hooks which have rusted, some worst than others. I anticipate having to replace them in the near future if I can't remedy the rust problem. I made this purchase because I liked the clean stainless still look but I am disappointed about how the hooks have stood up to in this limited used bathroom."
2,"look great but,......","These hooks are very appealing but, there is a flaw. They tend to pop pff the shower rod if you try to pull the curtain too quickly. While it makes it easier to remove a shower curtain for cleaning or replacement, 1 or 2 almost always come unhooked every time I open or close the curtain too quickly.Also if you use a metal shower rod like I do, you will have to wipe the rod atleast once a week. Metal on metal contact leaves a nasty black residue on the rod."
2,Eh,"These hooks are nice for the look, but they come off of the rod too much. Plus, if you live with a lot of people, you'll always know when they're getting in the shower b/c it makes a lot of noise. I went and got the plastic rings instead and I'm so much happier with them. They never come off and barely make any noise."
1,very annoying - don't buy,These constantly are falling off the shower rod. How could anyone sell a shower curtain hook that doesn't at least stay on the bar?
1,Don't buy,These hooks are too heavy - and the hook doesn't curl around the rod enough and they fall off. They're heavy and don't move across the bar easily.
3,nice but rusts,"I purchased these about 3 years ago, they began to rust a bit within a year. Other than that, they work fine and look better than plastic rings."
2,"Lots of form, little function","While these hooks are stylish, modern, and compliment any stainless steel accessories you may have in your bathroom, they don't work very well as showercurtain hooks. They hang the showercurtain well, but whenever I move the showercurtain to, say, get into or out of the shower, they come off the curtain rod. Every day I have to rehang the hooks. Every day! There must be a better set..."
3,Hooks fall off,"These are really nice looking shower curtain hooks and they last forever, but with a lot of shower rods that are telescoping, the hooks fall off the samller part of the rod. Mine would have lasted forever but I threw them away because of this design flaw."
3,Look great - BUT!,"Everyone wasn't kidding. They don't stay on. At all. I have had to refine my shower opening skills to make sure I'm not drowning in wet curtains. Not fun.But they look fantastic and that's really all that matters right?Feel solid too, very heavy."
2,"Not Very Stiff, It Does Bend",Well I bought this fork and 2 Amco stainless spoons because another reviewer said you cannot bend it. I used the fork to pick up a 2 pound london broil and it bent! I used the spoon to stir 3 pounds of mashed potatoes and it too bent. I had to straighten them out by hand but they are not in the same shape as they were when new. I am disappointed as I need a good sturdy fork.
4,Great for fans of old fashioned science fiction...,"A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE MOST AMAZING KIND...What looked like a big black box - perhaps fifty feet high, two hundred long - had settled squarly on Jerry Conklin's car. The townspeople of Lone Pine, Minnesota, were the first to see it - and one of them was the first and only human to shoot at it. He paid for his rashness with instant death. Within hours the public knew something strange had happened and was beginning to face the incredible possibility that the Earth harbored something from outer space. A machine? An intelligent being? There was no way to know. But Jerry Conklin knew. The Visitor had scooped him up, held him prisoner for several hours, then let him go. Jerry knew the Visitor was a living, intelligent creature!"
1,Boring,"This has got to be his worst novel. I gagged my way through it. I was mad at myself for not tossing it aside. I enjoyed some of his other novels, so I kept reading."
2,Left me flat,This book didn't live up to my standards for Ms. Hatcher. The story was old and over done. The characters were boring and one dimensional. Sorry.
5,Antonacci fan!,"Anna Caterina Antonacci is a fabulous, generous singer and actress~!This is one of her many powerful roles on dvd---we are lucky to have them.She was excellent as ""Carmen"", mesmerizing in ""Rodelinda"" anda wonderful, spurned ""Donna Elvira"" in ""Don Giovanni""!I am surprised at the other insulting review of her performance here.I believe Callas would admire Antonacci's work!"
2,sound X image,"The sings are great, but the video director and audio editor (Giovanna Nocetti) is out! Total amateur!"
2,Too much salicylic acid!,"Seller was awesome, we LOVE amazon. This product was a bit disappointing however..there was WAY too much sylic acid in it, and my hubby put it on every time he washed or shaved, and not only did it dry out his skin, it literally BURNED it, causing sored just below the lips! I was mortified and made him stop using it IMMEDIATELY, and sent it back! We were under the impression (due to the products description) that it would be a mild remedy to someone with more sensitive skin.. WRONG! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with NORMAL skin either. Sorry Jack Black, you get an F- for this one."
4,Kids Love It,"We bought this tent over a year and a half ago when my son wanted to make his bedsheets into a tent every night. He's now four and still loves it. It's light, strong, and flexible, good for playing with as well as sleeping in. Both my four and two year old adore it and haven't managed to break or rip it, which seems miraculous to me. Downside: it can get hot in there, rolling up the ""windows"" only cools it down somewhat. However, the kids didn't seem to mind that much. It's a favorite when friends come to play also."
3,Fun for a while,"We were hoping this would work to keep our son in his bed all night. It's cute and has little ""windows"" that roll up and secure with Velcro. I think he liked it for a little while, but then he decided he just needed a bigger bed. Once we put him in a queen sized bed in the guest room, he did much better. Every kid has his/her own quirks, I suppose.I am sure we will use this as a play tent with our second son when he's older. When the tent arrived, it had a strong smell. I'm sure if we wash it once or twice the smell will go away."
2,Disappointed,I expected this tent to have a full fitted sheet and zippers. This tent has velcro that does not work and a partially fitted sheet. It was very disappointing.
3,Changes Don't Improve Product,"After reading the reviews regarding this product, I decided to purchase one. Was very disappointed to learn that the zippered doors had been replaced by inadequate velcro strips that don't really shut the door or window. Also very disappointed in the musty smell -- we had to air it out all day long and it still smells like a moldy basement. I think the idea is great and the execution poor. Should have ordered a different, similar tent."
4,Mom of Two Boys,"We have this tent for 2 years already and my 7yo son loves it! Will be buying another one for the other 5yo son. It gets hot inside if completely closed, but the kids kick off their blankets anyways, so no worries of them getting cold at night. The ""sheet"" part detaches from the tent, so it's easy to clean, but the ""sheet"" is of low quality and thread count. The tent is quite durable, however, and stands the test of play."
5,LOOOOVEEEE IT,"This is a durable, rugged tent. The tent stays UP ! It has hidden poles that are not plastic...It has lasted 18 months with my 6 and 4 year old taking it up and down. Would definately recommend and would buy again. It is waay more expensive than the $20 tent in Walmart - but the value ( and aggravation) are worth it. Once it is up, it stays up."
4,Grandson's hideaway,"My grandson is 11 today. He liked the tent and has put it on his top bunk. He loved the ""keep out"" and ""private"" signs. It was not hard to put together. I wasn't happy that it cost more than some other bed tents."
4,Mayan Natural World Revealed,"This is an excellent guide for anyone interested in the Mayan world, both past and present. It is also a useful travel companion to take on a trip to Central America. The illustrations are excellent, and Ms Schlesinger writes ina clear, uncluttered style that is a real pleasure to read. A magical book about a people who saw the world through other eyes than our own."
2,White border,When I purchased this poster the border wasn't there. The poster I purchased previously did not have a border. I don't like it in the frame.
1,Nothing New Here,"I had hoped for updated info on the Estrogen controversy, but got none. Still, it's a good read for folks who haven't previously done their research."
1,menopause revolution not helpful,The information in this book was somewhat dated and provided no new information. I was looking for studies and new facts about menopause and this book seems to be one person's viewpoint. I pitched it as soon as I read it.
4,A Tank of a Watch,"I've had this watch ~ 2 months now and its still growing on me. It's bold and in your face and the steel looks like something you'd see on a fine handgun, beautiful. I've never owned a watch of this size and weight but you hold it in your hand and it just feels indestructable. Maybe the heaviest watch I've ever felt but if you're considering this watch you probably already know that.It's already been surfing with me and dropped, no problems, of course. So impressed by the gas-filled luminous markers, 10x brighter than an ""indiglow"" style.Pins are very tough to remove and finding replacements for bent ones is a task. Also a few of the black link inserts have just slightly worn to where you can see the steel underneath peeking through.Overall, a very impressive, intimidating watch that has handled every mishap with ease. Highly recommend it to any looking for a watch of this type."
2,Unprepared for the ending,"A former rabid Joyce Carol Oates fan, I find myself often disappointed and this is one of those times. I could not fault the writing, only the characters portrayed. I am sorry to say I am enjoying those books written under JCO's other names Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly more than the overly angst ridden later books of Ms. Oates."
5,Really good..I cried,"This was a really good book...It's about a shy woman teacher, fairly young, who moves to a new town. She meets a strange older woman who's an artist, and they form a very interesting realationship--it deals a lot w/loneliness, I think. yeah."
4,"I feel mystified, and distanced. But I liked it.","I stopped reading this book after 20 pages or so because I felt nothing for the characters (the two women). I returned to it after a week of bad reading (gratefully) and became hooked. I came to feel attached to Sheila and Monica, but only to a point, a very frustrating point. The author was giving me descriptions of the women's relationship instead of a direct view.As for feeling mystified -- just a general feeling of not always knowing what in the world she was talking about. A jumble of descriptions and references on the page, and a big question mark in my head! The descriptions and references were usually psychological in nature, which is what drew me in and kept me going.The book is weird and complex (as another reader aptly put it), in a relationship way, and will likely hold your interest if that's what you're after."
4,Using Lectio Divina to prepare Sermons Year B,"Part of a series, this small book is full of ""starters"" to help one use the Sunday Propers in one's practice of Lectio Divina, the practice of spiritual reading, meditating, praying, and contemplating the Scriptures. I have found it very useful in my own Spiritual life to use this book as a starter on the Monday BEFORE the Gospel Lesson to bring the lesson into focus for my spiritual life. I am firmly convinced that this has enhanced my preaching as well as I use the Gospel lesson in particular each day to center my devotions. One could of course apply lectio divina to the other Proper Lessons as well.Written from a Roman Catholic perspective, there are times when the Gospel lessons will diverge from other lectionaries, but once one has the ""technique"" down, one should be able to easily apply the practice to the lesson they are using. This particular volume is for Year A; there are other volumes for the other Church Years B & C."
3,Good,"May be a really great book for intermediate level spanish. I personally have used a little easier, more oraganized spanish books but not on this level.."
2,Don't Bother,"This text was required for a spanish class. I have to say it is the least helpful text I have ever used. The reviews in the back of the book are alright and the cultural information is great, but the main exercises are a bit confusing. I felt that there was a lot of information missing in the lessons. I had to fill in the gaps on my own with additional reference guides. If you are interested in cultural readings this might be alright but if you want a strong grammar foundation I would suggest looking elsewhere."
1,Not stable,"I used this card on a daily basis for a few months to connect to the wireless networks at my office, at home, and on the road.In all locations, the card routinely dropped me from the network I onnected to. These drops were brief-- often less than a second or up to five seconds-- but they usually disrupted whatever I was doing and caused me to have to reestablish sessions.I have since switched to a card from a more well-known provider, and have not been dropped once from any network.I do not recommend this card."
4,"Works as described, but snags","The double rod installs easily and is of good quality. Towels do dry as described, even in a windowless bathroom. The design is careless, however, since the thing in Chinese and we are all used to how poor their products are. So shower-curtain rings snag on the join between two pieces of the rod, since no plastic or rubber ring is provided to buffer the transition."
4,duo shower rod,We are remodeling our bathroom and taking out the triple shower doors. This took away a towel bar too. The duo shower curtain rod will replace the towel bar as well as give a place to hang the bath rug that previously hung on the tub side. There is only a shower now and no tub.If we redo another bathroom I would use another one of these.
2,"Great design, but it is rust covered",I've been using this shower curtain rod for 12 months. Both rods are now horribly rusted. My towels have been ruined. It is obviously not stainless steel.
3,quality problems,"I bought one of these from a store a few years ago and really liked it. So, when I moved I decided to buy another - this time from Amazon. The first one I got was defective. The rod would not extend when turned. I could see what the problem was and could probably have fixed it, but since it was also the wrong color (my fault) I returned it and ordered another one. The second one was better but also would not extend enough to hold itself firmly to the wall. I used the screw method to anchor this one and decided to keep it, because the way these things work you practical have to destroy the thing to remove it- if you used the screws.My guess is that these are retuned products being sold on Amazon. Unfortunately, because of the way the product is designed (it works well the first time its assembled) after it's been assembled and disassembled it may not assemble well thereafter..."
1,Don't bother,This thing is a nightmare. I tried several times to install it by myself and also with one other person helping. It's useless junk. I was better off with the $12.99 cheapo from the local bath supply store.
4,Wow! This was an experience!,"Perhaps persons familiar with medieval and renaissance music don't find this surprising, but in listening to this and some other recordings of medieval music recently I was struck by distinctly ""Indian"" (i.e., Asian, not North American) sound of *some* (a minority) of the pieces. My interest is certainly stimulated to learn more about the ancient musical connections between East and West. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I was hoping for a ""sanitized"" selection of songs that would be more generally uplifting in terms of content. (Some of the songs are quite ribald. However, others may see that as a plus.) Spanning the better part of a millennium, this disc provides a tantalizing peek at a musical world of tremendous variety and depth."
3,Good but not Great,"I bought this CD with high expectations of greatness. I thought that when I put it into the CD player I would hear the melodic tunes from the Medieval era as if I were actually there. I wanted to be taken back in time-and in a sense I was. However, some of the songs were a bit too operatic for my liking. I wanted to hear more harps and flutes but instead I got more tenors. Although, I must say that some of the cuts did possess the essence of the time-not as many as I had hoped. Therefore-it could very well be there are more Sinners than Saints on this one!"
4,pretty good,this is my first expierence with Imperative Reaction and i am quite pleased with it. there is just something i dont like about them.. something i cant put my finger on.. which is why i didnt give them a perfect rating. maybe its the fact that the songs feel repetitive.. even though at the same time they don't.. it's wierd. overall a good listen though. i would describe them as dance industrial
2,Child's book for adults,"There is no real conflict in this book. A guy from the Library of Congress suddenly shows up in a land with elves. He gets a job with a Historian as his Librarian, becomes the companion of a dragon, meets the girl of his dreams, and rescues everybody and his dog. Each task presented to this guy is solved with use of logic and no special effort. The thing that bothers me the most is that this couch potato does all this strenuous labor and does not seem to sweat or have much trouble getting things done."
2,Don't expect much from Companion,"""Dragon Companion"" is a very low-thought fantasy novel. This book would be great for a young child interested in starting in fantasy. The plot is straightforward and simple, but lacks depth. Perhaps the most important question (why the companion got into a new world) is never answered. The companion solves these ""problems"" using simple logic. Don't expect much tension or page turning suspense. Instead, pass this book on to children in order to increase their reading aptitude."
5,"Great book, absolutely loved it!",This is a great book for anybody interested in becoming a better human being. Very well written and full of valuable insights. A must read!
1,This product wears out fast and falls apart easily.,"We have been buying this cane for years. However, the last three we have purchased over the past 2 years have fallen apart, don't fold, or the tip just falls off. The grip also shreds easily. We are very sad to see how the quality of this cane has diminished and plan to buy all our canes elsewhere from now on. We can return the cane that will not fold up but finding a box it will fit into has been more trouble than it is worth..."
5,This is an easy to read and enjoyable trip into working.,"This was an enjoyabe read and fast paced. In a very light style I was able to gain insight and knowledge on how one woman made it in a man's world. She also was human and sincere enough to share her ups and downs with us. Not quite a Danielle Steele journey, this book lets you know what you might have to give up and what you might gain by working part time, full time and balancing a family. I enjoyed the humor and the personal feelings of what it takes to keep an idea and a dream in place. Not everyone can do this and you certainly have to know yourself. I applaud Lane Nemeth for letting us into her triumphs and letting us share her low moments. It is a very personnal look at a woman's desire to create a business and have a family."
5,A fascinating window into another era.,"This very un-PC book is an account of a 1920-21 circumnavigation of the world in a 99-foot power-yacht (state-of-art for the time) by a wealthy Chicago cement-magnate and his wife and crew.Different cultures are encountered, bad weather, risky close-calls, hard conditions and ofcourse, exotic, faraway locales (many decades before Club Med and Hotel Chains spread worldwide)----All aptly and vividly described by Australian writer Dale Collins, who was onboard for the majority of the voyage.The book is a window into another era. The reader can't help appreciate the changes that have swept the world since, some good, some bad.This book comes from a time when there were still parts of the world that were relatively unexplored and mysterious.If you like Sea-Tales, epsecially true ones, this is a volumeyou shouldn't miss."
2,"The ""leaders"" are figureheads here","The descriptions of this cd included here at Amazon, like the title itself, are highly misleading. This is not a session led by Farrell and Woodard, but by vocalistic/pianist John Larkin. Larkin is an ok post-bop pianist. As a vocalist, he is somewhat like Kurt Elling after a talentectomy. Actually, that putdown isn't fair . . . to Elling. Larkin shouts, he, er, ""scats,"" he veers off pitch - generally, the vocals are pretty unbearable.As for the playing, I bought the album for Farrell. It is far, far, far from his best recording. He tends to respond to circumstances, with fine showings on his albums as leader, with Andrew Hill and other solid jazzmen, but he tends towards bombast in less exclusive company. Here, nothing much memorable results. I am not enough of a student of drummers to critique Woodard. He doesn't sing on this recording, in any case, and that is blessing enough."
2,Disappointed,"I am a fan of music by Andrew Lloyd Weber usually, and also enjoy listening to requiae as a music form. Having heard ""Pie Jesu"" from this requiem and finding it most moving and beautiful, I ordered the Weber Requiem. It was indeed disappointing with the exception of Pie Jesu, band 7 on the CD. The remainder of the Requiem, regrettably, should be consigned to the dustbin of History. However, the Pie Jesu as sung by Sarah Brightman was worth the cost of the entire CD."
2,One Great Song,This piece sounds like a musical and proves Sir Webber should stick to that medium. I bought this disk for one and only one cut; Pia Jesu. This is as beautiful a piece of music as I've heard and the credit goes as much to the boy tenor as to Webber.
1,Sir Andrew should stick to musicals,"What's not to like about Andrew Lloyd Webber? Well, his attempt at liturgical composition. This work blends Old with New NOT very harmoniously. Much of the score rings of tunes reminiscent from his other works such as CATS, Evita, and Phantom of the Opera. His obviously intentional cacophony in places causes one to wonder if perhaps he had unresolved altar boy issues! Even if one wants to argue that musically, the piece is impressive, the volume levels of this recording make it difficult to listen to without having to constantly adjust the knob."
5,The Music's Fine,"I am no musicologist, but I found this composition spiritually alive and musically pleasurable from beginning to end. The Hosanna alone is worth the price of the CD; and, yes, Mr. Domingo sings it loudly. But he is singing words uttered by ""a very great multitude"" who were said to ""cry out"" (Matthew 21) evidently because they saw the general of their ancestral Defender coming to lift their oppression. If this hail to salvation shouldn't be sung ""so loudly,"" one wonders what earthly occasion would justify loud singing? Throughout the cantata (is that what this is?) there are not only repetitions that unite the piece musically, but tender trills from the flute, the bells, the oboe--little runs that shiver through the music like fish in a stream, or hints of life cracking an intricate ice palace. Listen to this requiem and others. Come on in; the music's fine."
3,"A. Lloyd Webber - Requiem/Domingo,Brightman","Some of it just beautiful, but some a little too modern for my taste. But it was very well performed."
4,The modern requiem ..,".. is defined by two men. John Rutter .. and Andrew Lloyd Webber. I'm only giving it four stars because nothing is perfect .. but I've sung the Webber Pie Jesu in concert, as well as John Rutter's. They both hang tears on my lashes."
5,A must for your Clie,I use this at work with my SJ20 Clie. It charges the PDA and syncs at the same time. Charging is slower it seems than the regular AC adapter but that doesn't matter much to me. Great value - a must if you have a Clie!
5,Great Buy,"Being a bud drinker, my husband loved this retro sign. For the price you could not resist buying . Going in his man cave."
1,Overpriced item.,"For the price of this booklet, it is too expensive. in my opinion is should be about $5 to $9. $24 is way too much. As for the content, I don't think it is very useful. It tells some pretty obvious things, and tells stuff that most people aready know."
2,Global Biodiversity Assessment Report.,"Huge heavy book, highly technical. You must have excellent knowledge of the subject to understand and follow, but a good resource as to what the plans of the globalists are."
4,We are screwed!,"Here is the rational for the emplimentation of Agenda 21. Scary stuff!Watch and listen to the key words...STAINABLE DEVELOPMENTUN master plan to save the world and eliminate at least 80% of the worlds population.Animals and plants have more rights than humans. Most of the world is set aside for plants and animals.No private property for humans and we will be restricted to tiny alcoves or communes less tha 1% of the land area.Limit families to one child.No cars , either walk or ride a bike.No recreation of any type, like skiing that might interfere with the environment .In short , it is the total regimentation of all life on the planet where humans are the problem.How will this happen? Well, it is happening right now as Sustaiable Developement in our local communities.Check your local planning department and it they belong to ICLEI's.This admission is so staggering that we are to become automatons with no free will to do anything."
3,Not the best,"I thought this was an okay book. I mean first of all, what was up with Hannah in the cover and yearbook. SHE WAS WEARING EARRINGS! I mean, isn't she not supposed to. I also thought the middle school book was an all time low. If your getting teased you should tell someone about it. I mean she's all like ""I will NOT tell anyone about Victoria teasing me"" that's a big No-No. Also, Victoria getting kids to singa song, would that ever happen? Hell no! Also she gos ""Like"" to much. If someone used that all the time like her, they would be the one being teased! And getting your ears pierced without permision... that won't change anything, just get your parents angry with you. And I also think her parents were too light on the punishment. They got all upset (Which they should have, Abby broke a rule) and then they made her do some community service, and Hannah is probaly gonna help out. All in all, I'd say a thumbs down. Not a best for Anne Mazer."
4,Anson Y.'s book review. HK.< Why am I here ? >,"Hey I think there is a bit problem here. I've written on the 'Super Special # 1' but not this book . .............SO.................. Then why is my review for the 'Super Special #1' here? All the other ones but the last two is the same as mine. You'll give other people the wrong ideas if someone read those reviews.Okay forget about the wrong reviews, I think this is a good book, but not a great one. I would also hate to fall in front of everyone in the first day of school. To find out what I'm talking about, read it yourself."
5,Awesome Book!,"In this book, Abby is starting 6th Grade! I found that really exciting, because everything's changing for her. Her sisters and Abby went shopping for new clothes. Then her sisters told her to buy clip-on earrings.I think this is one of the good books in the series and I try to read it as much as I can.Read the book to see the surprising things that happened to Abby!"
1,disappointed,hey the product description says it is filled. The seller put in comment that it is unfilled. yep its unfilled. pretty useless like that
2,Brute Force...Or is it...,OK well i got this game beacuse the reviews...i was soon to figure out that its nothing like Halo and its just so sketchy. Ur so called special abbilities stink. and its so hard to move the team at once...also the team always dies even wen on aggresive because they dont shoot back.....this game is a 2star because it was fun solo without a team.
3,Worth the wait?,"Come on, how many of you waited and waited for Brute Force to come out? I sure did. With all the extra time they spent on the game it should have been a lot better. I'll list a few points here...Good:-The graphics are really nice.-Awesome physics (bad guys go flying).-The multiplayer co-op is loads of fun.-There's tons of action.-It's really fun (most of the time).-Wasting your friends in deathmatch.Bad:-The story is corny.-The characters are corny.-The enemies are corny.-The voice acting is very corny.-The gameplay gets redundant.-The gameplay gets redundant (anoying isn't it).-The level designs could be better.-What happened to the great AI they talked about?-""Brute Force""... Isn't that a deodorant?Ok, I guess the good outweighs the bad, but not by enough to make Brute Force a truly great game. Now I'm not saying this wasn't worth the fifty bucks... Just rent it first. Peace out, I'm going to go play Halo now."
3,Just could have been better,"The game is fun, and it is difficult when you start comparing to amazing games like Halo and stuff. The biggest problem is that the trailer and advertising made the game look so much better than what actually came out. It is a fun game though and worth the $20 that it sells for now. The idea of tactical strategy teamplay shooter is great though and hopefully developers take off from this idea and make even better games in the future. The new price tag makes the game worth it. It definetely does not ""suck"" as others say it does, it just didn't match the high expectations. If you do play it (which I do recommend), get 3 other people to play with you on co-operative and have fun."
5,The Best,This is the game I have been waiting for since I finished playing Halo. I recommend this game to anyone who has an Xbox. And the best part is that it is Xbox only.
5,Brute force is DA BESt,"I am a HUGE x-box fan and it is the best system. if it is then it needs good games, thats exactly wat it has. this is the top right now. i beat and loved halo and saw screen shots for halo2 and they r great. i saw just aboutt every trailer for brute force and it is a great game that all of u should buy or reserve."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"i agree with jumpertheguywhojumps. i was ready to play this game when i bought it at FULL PRICE at my birthday becasue they made the game look good. but the game sucked i though it sucked, my friends thought it sucked, everyone i know thought it sucked, must i go on? Never the less; the point it dont buy this game it you want a truley amazing fighting game buy halo or wait like the rest of us for the highly antisapated halo 2"
5,STOP SAYING THE GAME IS BETTER THAN HALO!,"I think that Brute Force is gonna be a terrific game... I've seen the videos and read about, but there is one thing that's bothering me. All these people say that Brute Force is gonna be better than Halo and I'm pretty confident in saying that they probably never even played Brute Force...... Look people, it's gonna take more than fancy graphics and great gameplay to beat Halo, a game that already has those things. It's gonna take a DEEP ... story line and 100000000000000000000000000 ton of replay value, dont forget an addictive multiplayer... Besides, even if the game is better than Halo, big deal, then there was Halo 2.....Dont get me wrong though. I am very excited about Brute Force and even more since I found it will be an xbox live game. XBox Live's lineup is stronger than the xbox's launch lineup, which says a lot....mechassault, unreal championship, and others...Maybe the ps2 does have some competition..."
5,brute force is awesome!!!,brute force kicks ... baby.and probably is better than halo.even though halo 2 it may be better that it.house of the dead almost exceeds the graphics of halo and brute force.unreal championshipalmost meets the rank of halo 2 and brute force.all these games are awesome and i reconmend them to all mature game players to buy them.even if your parents say no sneak out and buy this awesome game!!xbox is awesome!!!
5,xbox game,very cool game it is a blast i loved i played it though the campain i couldnt quit it i was addicted
4,Exceptionally good,"I loved this game, but the whole thing about the destroying monsters gets repetitive and linear. Also there is is basically NO bosses! Whats up with that.......you think they'd put a little challenge into it! But this rest is awesome! So check it out, Brute Force."
2,Pffft.,"To everybody who wrote a review before this game came out, a heartfelt 'bleep' you. Wait till you've played the game before you review it.Brute Force is boring. Plain and simple. Despite some very well thought out ideas employed to control a group of characters and a mulitude of different weapons, the game has almost nothing in the way of a storyline, mission briefings are just intermissions between shoot outs, and weapon effects are painfully lacking; especially for a game on the most powerfull console on the market today.Enviorments are good, occasionally very good, but they are constantly re-used and get old real fast.Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and skip this one."
2,Overrated,"I found myself disappointingly disappointed in this hyped up shoot em' up ""follow up"" to halo II. This game complicates the wonderful gamepad of the X-box(Trigger to fire boys, thats what they are there for!!!!!!!!!!!). The character swith is not slick or smooth nether is thier A.I. when oyu are not in control of them. If you love halo than this will be a bum trip. If you dont love halo (what is wrong with you???????!!!!!!!) maybe you could dig it."
4,"good, but not halo good!","Brute Force is a fun, and addicting game with four awesome characters and awesome graphics and levels. But, it is not as good as halo. The levels can get annoying and if you get lost, you could spend an eternity finding your way to the location needed. I would still buy it to kill off time until halo 2. A great game for you and three friends!"
1,Who are you people?,"To anyone that does not own this game, heed the advice of this adult who borrowed the game from a friend - it really is garbage.I feel morally obligated to speak up when I noticed the number of rave reviews here. If something you own has disappointed you - please speak out with reviews. It keeps things balanced.BF was inconsistent, not terribly ""new"" (same ideas rehashed) the character switching in real time has its fun but it also has major flaws. Oh, and it wasn't fun.Bottom line, this thing was hyped, hyped, hyped. And now, nine months after its release it still stinks. Don't buy this game - spend your money on GTA if you are an adult. Way more fun."
2,It might be good but not that good,Listen up if you think this game is going to rock you can think that but if you play halo damn that game is mad ill. I mean you get to pick up alien guns its easy to move. This game it pretty hard to move your all crammed. I say if you want to buy it buy it but my best advice to you is rent it at blockbuster see if its made for you. ps. GET HALO
4,waste of money,"ok. I bought this game after seeing a bunch of great reviews, and the people at the store said it was a very good game. first of all, it's not. There are only like 5 levels, each one takes about 20 minutes to beat, so if you do the math it takes a little over an hour to beat the game. I don't understand how someone said it took them two months to beat one level. second, the third person part gets in the way especially if enemies are right in front of you. The game DOES get repetitive. The multiplayer is TERRIBLE. if you try to play 4 player, you can hardly see what you're doing. Overall, this game is a complete waste of money and time. If you're considering buying this, rent it first and then decide."
1,HYPE!,"This game was all about the hype. I rented it because my co-worker at EB said that it wasnt that good. My friend and I played for about 3 hours. The maps were all linear, the characters were stupid, and the actual gameplay seemed to drag after the first hour, it just ended up being more of the same. I was rather disappointed. Mulitplayer not much better."
4,"oh, fi thsi game could have Live multiplayer...","The hype is well deserved for Brute Force--I was quite surprised by how much tactical planning you have to do in each mission--do I send Tex up ahead and have hawk sneak up on the enemy in her sleath mod? Or can flint snipe that guard on the crossway down that hill/ Can brutus hold his ground without getting killed? Where is that enemy fire coming from?This game can becme very chaotic, very quickly! It was chilling to hear my squad cal out for a medic as they were under fire ad saying,""one more hit and I'm a goner..."" yeah you can send in the clones, butit'll cost you ome serious doughif you keep messing up. Learning each member's special powers and skills was half the fun! But you can NOT waste them against the AI opponents--they're very, very smart!There will be Live downloads, but no Live multiplayer--that's the only flaw I have with it. If you have friends over often for a system ilnk throwdown, this game will be very, very popular !"
4,Money well spent,"I just bought this game an xbox is pushing this game with alot ofhype.It's worth the money.It's no HALO but you will enjoy this game.Graphics are a 10, Controles are smooth,I've bought alote of games this one is worth the money."
1,Dont Buy This Game,"This game [stinks]. I looked forward to it so much. Pre-ordered it and everything. This game is lame. It would have been a great game 5 years or so ago. The storyline [stinks]. Nothing new during the game. It is so easy. Just go slow and sniper everything. When you try to play multiplayer the 3rd person view is always in the way. The controls are just Halo controls, so it is easy to learn if you have Halo. This game should have been 1st person period. Rent it dont buy it and you will understand. Multiplayer is bad, so dont buy it. Rent it and you can beat it before you have to bring it back."
3,disappointing,"I don't feel like writing a whole review, but I highly suggest not going out to buy this game b/c it will be the next HALO. It's not. I picked it up yesterday from EB and I must say that it is not the stellar game it was supposed to be. I enjoy it and will not return it, but it is not HALO and should not be compared to it. Unless you are really looking for a shooter or you enjy these games I would go rent it first. It's a good game but not a great game"
3,The Ghost Review,"This game was supposed to be the next Halo, or at least one of the best games of 2003. Well it is not. It stars out really cool. When I first got it I thought that this is a real fun shooter. You control four totally different characters at the same time, that have totally different weapons and strenghts. But, as I kept on playing the game, I got really turned off by the fact that the game is too repetitive. The story live is extremely boering, and you are put into the same worlds over and over again. Nothing changes about the villans. And there really isn't much of a challenge. I prefer games like Ghost Recon, Halo, Hitman, and Splinter Cell. If you like brainless shotters that get old really fast buy Brute Force. But I recommend you save your money and go for something a little more challenging."
1,this game sux,"This game is horrible! I thought it would be the next killer app on xbox. I was so wrong. This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics suck, the gameplay is boring, and the control are horrible. This game was so bad, that I traded it in after three days. I would highly recommend avoiding this game."
3,It's ok for the price.,"Just received the splatter screen today. The handle is tacked on to the round rim of the screen. This is a poor design, if you flip the screen over it moves a hair. I figure after to many uses the tack will weaken. The screen itself looks to be heavy duty and shall work well."
5,Must Have,"I am not sure how I got along without such a quality splatter screen. It is heavy and well made. It stays on any size pot or pan just fine. It will smoke, so be ready to turn on the vent fan. But is does stop splatters (as intended) and allow liquids to evaporate - unlike a pot lid."
2,too flimsy..,Too flimsy!! I'm surprise it's one of the American Taste Kitchen recommendation. CostPlus sales a better version of it and cheaper in price.
2,Not good enough,I bought this about two months ago and used it several times. It does catch some grease but good amount do escape through the holes on to the top of the stove any beyond.
2,Disapointment in Splatter Screen,"I use two of these splatter screens, one on top of the other, and still get grease splattered on my stovetop. Guess I will try to find one that really works. Had one that I bought at K-Mart years ago that worked GREAT, but have not been able to find one like it since it wore out."
4,Better than the average splatter screen,This screen works better than the average screen. I bought it because of a recommendtation from Cooks Illustrated magazine. Some splatters get through but only about a third of what gets through my older screens.Another great use for these screens is cooling cookies or cakes. I put the screens on top of a dutch oven and my cakes & cookies cool very quickly and there's room for a couple dozen or more depending on the cookie size.
5,Recommended by a leading cooking magazine,"Cook's Illustrated just tested 8 different splatter screens and this is the only one that got the ""recommended"" rating!"
2,Flimsy,Not the sturdiest splatter I was using expecting to get. Wish I would've done a little more browsing before I settled on this one.
5,Wonderful to have in the kitchen!,"I hesitated on this for a while (did I really need it? would it really work?) until seeing it in action in my friend's kitchen. I've had occasion to use it twice since the purchase, and it works great! It really is very reassuring when you start realizing that oil is beginning to splatter all over your kitchen, to reach into the cupboard, grab this screen, and viola 97% of the splatter is eliminated!! This is top-rated by cook's illustrated for being the most sturdy (i.e., mesh won't break on you after one use!) and being of good size (enough for a 12"" pan, I believe they said). Highly recommended, and once you have one, you'll wonder what you did without it!"
4,Every Kitchen Needs One,"Every kitchen needs a splatter screen sooner or later. The screen works so well because the screening is so much finer than that of the average splatter screeen. Porus enough to allow water vapor to pass, but fine enough to catch most oil or grease dropplets or splatters. No harder to clean than any other screen."
1,Help!,"As I posted on the Brown-leather version of this same journal's page, there is no information given about the size and # of pages. If anyone has purchased this and knows, please post a response here. I'm interested in it's dimensions (i.e. 6x9 inches), and the amount of pages in the journal. It would also be nice to know if the pages are lined. Please help."
2,overly detailed account of Che's life; shadows ignored,"I saw this book in a big chain bookstore and I was immediately intrigued. I do not believe in communism, totalitarian regimes or imposing your views on anyone else. I get a little surprised every time a silly model dressed in thousand dollar clothes voices admiration for ""el Che"". To me he was an adventurer. This book, although written with deep admiration for its subject (it is not objective or balanced and does not document too much of the dark side)), is very informative. The guy had the most exciting kind of life, regardless of his meager means. He traveled like crazy. He started out without any clear ideology, and then he showed off his inner king. He did not give a damn for the women in his life, or his babies. He would just go on with his life and leave them aside. He had a cute face but that's about it. I would only wear a T-shirt with his face on a very special occasion, e.g. to irk somebody on purpose."
2,RUINED,"Alright so there's some coolish punk style riffage on show here but its very monotonous very quick, not enuough substance. And its emo. You have been warned."
3,It wasnt that bad!,"This movie wasnt that bad like everyone is saying. Granted its no scary, make you cry for mommy movie, it does provide a few momments that made me jump. I say watch this movie and if you dont like it, you can always sell it to a anime kid for twice as much."
1,Urgh!,"I had high expectations. After all, this is in the genre of Asian horror, and many of them are masters at it. However, this movie was a huge disappointment. First off, it is direct-to-video, with the gritty camcorder appearance. The only high point is that each ""chapter"" is only approximately ten minutes long. Secondly, the director seems to have thrown in a whole cauldron of different shock effects from many successful Asian horror masters. The rattling sound that was so unnerving in Ju-On. The pasty-faced, long haired ghost that features in many of the movies. I must confess, I only got through the first two chapters before deciding I wasn't going to enjoy it. The visual quality put me off right away. Anything direct-to-video is such for a good reason. There was no buildup of suspense. The shocks weren't shocking enough. Just, blech."
1,Worst rip-off ever!,"This is a straight-to-video-let's-try-to-cash-in-from-the-success-of-""Ju-on: The Grudge"" movie. They steal elements from all 4 Ju-on movies and do a very poor job of it. They fail to explain to the audience who the ghosts are and why they're so angry. Also, the ghost from scene to scene seems to change. Please avoid this movie at all costs.Some other fun facts...- Presented in Fullscreen- Looks like it was filmed with a camcorderMovies to watch instead...- Ju-on: The Grudge- Dark Water- Ringu- Phone"
2,A complete waste of money!!!!,"I've been in a Japanese horror fix lately watching some of the greats like Ringu and Ju~on, but after watching JuRei:Uncanny I was extremely let down. Oh the movie has a few parts that will make you jump and its great how the movie doesn't depend on huge effects to get its point across like other horror films, but thats all it had. The story line is just not there. I know that Japanese horror can be irratic and jumpy and usually is a good thing but JuRei:Uncanny is so jumpy that it makes no sence. The plot gose backwards and for awhile ties together nicely but by the middle of the movie it just loses its contnuity. My advice is if you want a good horror movie you might want to pass this one up."
2,I guess I was hoping for more....,"I suppose the operative term here that I failed to give sufficient credence to is ""brief"" as in ""brief history."" The book left me wanting more. More specific information, better quality photographs. The weapons section completely omits the 90mm Recoilless Rifle as a base defense weapon used by Security Police and trained in up to at least the early 1980's. The .50 Caliber Machine Gun has been around since 1918, not the 1930's. The USAF Security Police/Security Forces have an impressive history and much of it was glossed over. I understand that all books cannot be all things to all people, but it seems to me that the research lacked breadth and depth in many areas. This book represents a good start towards something that really needs to be done and done well. That is the book I thought I was buying."
5,wonderful,there are many of life's lessons simplified for the understanding of children.This book has a unique way of getting these messages acrossas well as holding the interest of a child.
5,candy for your eyes and ears!!,"There's just something about Jim Woodring's art in ""Trosper"" that triggers the happy centers in my brain! When accompanied by Bill Frisell's lovely music, it's like the cherry on the sundae!"
5,"Great, Superb, Soothing","What a wonderful sound, the music and the mood it creates is superb. Helped my wife through the delivery of our first baby, aiding her relaxation and soothing her to sleep."
5,Best Chicken Wings I've Ordered!,"I got this album seing that it only costs as much as an order of chicken wings ($3.50) at my local chinese restaurant here in NYC. And let me tell you, if all chicken wings tasted this good I'll be ordering everyday. Distorted guitars, mind bending drones, and electronic beats; tickle my taste buds in every way they can. But like all the other reviewers said it's not a cd for everyone and it is something you really grow into. This cd is definitely a feast in itself, and for the price it's going for it's a steal."
4,I ordered this to replace my copy that was flooded in Hurricane Katrina,because it contained my favorite blueberry muffin recipe! Many of the other ones are great too.
3,Visual Cookbook Lovers Need not Buy,I love cookbooks & bought this one on a Amazon Promotion. No pictures; bland writing. Small size.
1,Breakage problem,"2-3 times a week player. 40+yr old players.We broke 5 balls in 7 games.Great action on the ball and easier on the hands, but they don't last.Hopefully these were out of a bad batch.Not really excited about the increase in price over the Red Ace either."
1,A Disappointment...,"I, too, snapped up this book thinking it was going to be as enjoyable as ""The Abduction of Julia."" Instead I got 2 unlikeable characters in a very boring novel. There was no sizzle in the plot and I could not bring myself to believe that the hero broke her heart years ago by marrying another as a noble sacrifice. She, on the other hand, was just an idiot who didn't move on. Don't buy the book thinking it is similar to her last."
4,This could have been 5 stars with an epilogue,"I really enjoyed this book, but I feel as though the ending was rushed. A lot of the middle part of the book could have been left out and more added from the marriage forward.. I just felt like the ending was rushed. I would like to have found out more of what happened with the aunts and Robert and Liza - this could have been remedied with an epilogue. I have noticed that with a lot of books lately, the story just starts getting really interesting and then ends. I just felt a bit cheated - like I said this would have been a solid 5 stars if a few pages of epilogue was added."
4,Good book,"Good reading, I didn't get bored and skip ahead. Loved the strong heroin,Arabella. Cant wait to see if Robert and Liza get their own story."
2,A heart-stopping...disappointment!,"This is NOT The Abduction of Julia, not by a long shot. I snapped it up, thinking I'd be getting the same quality book from this author as The Abduction, and finding her new effort to be draggy, long, boring, and uninspired. The heroine is a nitwit and the hero is unlikeable. The other characters are tired cliches. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, for any reason."
5,A refreshing approach to sketchings!,"Concise and clear, with a multitude of examples and direction. I consider this book as essential to sketching as my pencil and paper."
1,Huh?,I couldn't wait to receive this book. You cannot imagine my disappointment when I flipped through the pages and saw these horrible copies of drawings. They're so badly copied that you can't see the examples that the author are trying to illustrate. I was majorly disappointed.
2,Not worth the time or money,"Sometimes one should LOOK at a book before purchasing it. I certainly should have looked at this one.I hate it. The author has no discernible technique and some finished drawings included in the book go beyond bizarre -- he seems to also have great fondness for including Biblical images that look foolish rather than showing reverence.I could have spent the money on something useful. If your idea of drawing is slashing away with broad strokes with a stick of charcoal, then you might possibly find something useful in this book. That method is useful at certain times in certain drawings, but not in everything. It's the kind of thing that quickly can become garish, and there is much garishness in this publication.The only useful thing I discovered in this book is to never buy another book by this author again."
5,a must have,"If you have interest in drawing and are just starting, this book will be the perfect companion: notions about perspective, light, shadow, specificities like trees and rocks, viewpoints and framing, it has all.Great book for starters, and even for one who knows something about drawing, but not quite in a technical way...A must buy, especialy considering the price."
5,drawing concepts usage in other modes,I have done this type of drawng in the past and wanted to incorporate it into my embroidery and quilting. Excellent book.
5,You Won't Be Disappointed,You will not find a more complete book on landscape drawing. My advice is to grab it from Amazon while it is still in print. Mr. Hamm is the best.
5,Brilliant,I couldn't agree more with Mari Lamar's comments. Absolutely a must have for any art student.
5,Must Buy,"Very good book, has sufficient details regarding all aspects of business planning, it also provides some leads to look up secondary sources of information that will be helpful to anyone attempting to write a business plan. ""High tech start up"" and ""Entrepreneur America"" are also good buys."
3,good information but very badly organised,"This book contains all the right information that is needed to create a business plan, but the text is so badly organized that it becomes very frustrating when using it to actually write a plan."
3,This was okay,"The book is helpful but too lengthy in details--makes the process seem more diffucult than it should be. If you are an analytical business owner, this might be your cup of tea. However, if you're looking to get the job done quickly but efficiently, this book is not for you."
3,Right to start,"A good guide to start organizing ideas. Maybe sometimes too much academic, but yuo can easily pass on that."
1,Thoroughly confusing and cluttered,"This book would be suited for people who have completed several business plans and want to sharpen their knives. For a beginner I found it an unbelievably useless reference. It made references to things that weren't there, many examples were unrelated to the text, undecipherable sections, addendums to chapters with no clear connection to the host chapter... I could go on and on. I suspect it was proofread by an insular group."
3,"A TON of resources, but dry to read","There are many tables and charts that are VERY useful for biomass. Even though this book is old, a lot of the information is still good. I heard that the author passed away before finishing an updated revision.This book is horrible if you read it cover-to-cover, (except for chapter 4, which was pretty interesting)."
1,Good Work,"The service is very good. I purchased the wrong book, returned the book and got prompt attention and a refund with no problem."
2,"It's got one speed, Fast!","Overseas contractor. It's big, it's LOUD (coworkers were putting in their hearing protection around me when I use it), and the speed of the drill is very difficult to control. And don't think you can manuver this thing in tight spaces. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
5,"Astounding symphony, inventive conductor, brilliant cd.","The endless depth, the mystery of the music that is Betthoven's 9th is captured brilliantly by one of the great conductors of our time. If you are going to buy a 9th, this is worth considering, despite the price."
5,WGOD,"Anyone whose neck hairs don't rise when listening to the Ninth Symphony's choral part has no soul.Pastors should periodically play it to keep their flock from ever doubting there's a god.In case you miss the point, the Ninth is the closest that a piece of music has ever come to perfection, especially when the climax approaches the stratosphere as the bass, tenor, alto and soprano soloists sing dueling arias. Even more miraculous: Beethoven wrote the Ninth after lead poisoning rendered him totally deaf.So if you're going to eavesdrop on the heavenly spheres for a while, make sure your recording features at least one angel-on-earth among the soloists.And soprano Jessye Norman's wings always lift her to the rafters of even the most imposing concert hall."
5,Just AWSOME,I like this piece because of its musical conventions. The best of all classical symphonies.
1,Stunning!,"Only Solti is brilliant and creative enough to find a way to actually bore you to death with this symphony.This, the grandest expression ever composed by man, is performed as if every player had been injected with morphine first.I kept wanting to reach through the speakers and pull them into a more lifelike speed.Listen to Toscanini's take to wake up, or Karajan to march in triumph. Or if you want a slower speed, try Cluytens -- who actually puts feeling into it.But this is even worse than Vanska. Solti should have never let this record out; he can do much better than this."
4,MrBayes and Paup* manual,"I picked up this book because I was trying to learn MrBayes on my own with little success. With new versions of MrBayes, this book is already out of date and I encountered some frustration with my Nexus code being wrong, but between the help function, a lot of trial and error, and Hall's book I managed to successfully analyze my data using Bayesian analysis! I highly recommend it for the ""cookbook"" appeal-- software like PAUP and MrBayes can be difficult to learn on your own, and it's nice to have someone explain it step by step. I would have liked some instruction on saturation curves, but the book is fairly complete otherwise. MacClade is not mentioned, probably because it is more user-friendly than the programs included. PTME has been criticized for some incorrect statements in the book regarding theory, but I would expect students to use this book for practice more than theory. Overall, a great little manual to have on the shelf."
1,Faulty Pen,Don't know if the ink was dried up or the just didn't work but the pen didn't work from the beginning. Had to use a regular pen from the venue.
2,way too expensive for what it is....,I was expecting something a little more than what I already found online but .... it was the same material for $90.00
5,Excelent Book on IS-41,"I just read the authentication chapter, and I just left behind all my doubts about authentication. Anyway not just the Auth Chapter is excelent but the whole book."
2,"Yes it works, but it's too much work","Yes, Mona Vie works....BUT it's too much work. The bottle leaks, the screw off cap gets grungy and sticky and leaky. The Mona Vie stains anything it touches. The taste gets worse after the bottle is open for two days. The sediment amount is really inconsistent. Some bottles are nearly clear while others are loaded with gunk. The gunk (supposedly the ""best part"") is actually a yellowish brown mush, not reddish purple like you would expect. The taste is a bit salty, kind of bloody tasting perhaps.It does work, but I got sick of straining out the gunk and drinking it and cleaning up the counter and cleaning up the bottle - twice a day."
3,"OK, higher hopes for the next one","OK, OK, i've read better (rarely), but it could have been worse. the plot twists were intriguing, and there was wonderful charachter development and description, but it wasn't quite what i expected it to be. i can't wait for ""The Chalice"" to come out, and i keep hoping that king Tobeszijian will be able to get back to the first world (hint, hint). although he is rarley mentioned here."
4,"The Ring (The Sword, the Ring, and the Chalice, Book 2)",Purchased the entire set of three excellent condition and good reading! Thank you for the quick delivery too.
2,Not all that great,"In my humble opinion... when you title a book ""Puppy Training for Kids"" it should be written on the level for which the audience is intended. This book is way too complex and dull for children. It has a lot of information in it and is not presented in the best manner. Kids need to be educated in a way that makes it interesting to them. This book made my daughter feel like she was in school. Writing a book and putting photos of kids with dogs does not constitute ""Puppy Training for Kids"" in my book. It should of been titled ""Mommy Please Read This Book and Tell Me How To Train My Puppy"" sorry folks"
4,PRETTY GOOD BOOK,"Pretty good. Easy to understand unlike a lot of other dog books. I think it's just a little lacking in information, but it's a great book to start with, above average."
3,Just okay,"The book was okay, it didn't have as many training techniques that appealed to my nephew. However, it was a good book just not exactly what I was looking for."
4,My Logger head,This is the other presant my wife got me. She really pays attention to what I want. Couldn't be more pleased.
3,Not a replacement for standard open and/or box end wrenches...,"Straight forward, they work. If you have easy access to the nut or bolt that you are trying to tighten/loosen they work really well and are comfortable to use.But if you are working on anything that is a bit tricky to get access to (such as anything to do with exhaust systems or anything under the hood of a car) these fall way short.You need a lot more horizontal (or vertical) movement with these then your standard wrenches. And there are just some things that you can't get a box end wrench on (this is how this tool works, very similar to a box end wrench).All in all they work, but not as well as they would like you to think."
1,You will never use it,"This can only be used where you have a ton of clearance on EVERY side of the nut or bolt in question, and it turns out there are few bolts where that is the case - I bought one a year ago, and have yet to use it even once (though I pulled it out a number of times) because there is never enough clearance on every side. It is one of those items that seems like it should work, but is useless in the real world."
4,"When it fits, it works great","This tool has been both a joy and a disappointment to use. The joy, when it fits, is that it is very easy and intuitive to use, it holds the nut securely and there is no need to worry about it slipping, unlike a cresent wrench. This is now the first tool I usually grab to remove a nut. The disappointment is that for many situations, there is not enough room to fit the tool around the nut. Often, the space around the nut has been limited such that only a socket, boxed/open wrench or (groan) a crescent wrench will work.So, when it fits, it works great."
2,almost never useful,"When you do have an opportunity for these to work they work great. Unfortunately, that almost never happens. I've had these for years and the few times I've actually been able to use them, I call my wife over to show her. It's not like my wife enjoys me using wrenches, but these things are so useless that it has become a big joke."
2,Not practical,Looks neat in the advertisment's but not practical in everyday use. Only if the nut or bolt head is exposed in all directions will it work.
1,Not for everyday.,"Simple to say.These are advertised to the Suzy Homemaker. Along the same wavelength as the 200 in 1 screwdriver and 55 in 1 swiveling sockets. If you work with tools everyday, you'll buy this and never use it. I know; I did."
2,Obviously a 'Gadget' tool,"If you love having all kinds of tools or making things useful, this would be a great tool. If you want to do serious work chances are you will have to invent ways to make this tool helpful. It won't replace anything in your tool box. Practically the design presents a number of issues with torque and clearance that ultimately make this just a novelty for your tool box. Most people think this will be a clever gift for the handyman they know, and if you pay attention to the 5 star reviews no one actually talks about USING the wrench, just GIVING it to other people. Well, guess what? I was one of those people who received this as a gift and I am planning on returning it for something I can use."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"WELL, I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS TOOL. I HAVE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES NOW CHANGING OIL FOR FRIENDS. THE SMALLER THE BOLT HEAD YOU TRY TO USE THIS ON THE MORE IT SLIPS AND LOOSES ITS GRIP. NOW, IF YOU USE IT ON A BOLT HEAD CLOSE TO 3/4"" IT IS WONDERFUL. I GUESS WHAT I AM SAY IS, FOR THIS TOOL TO WORK CORRECTLY.....BIGGER IS BETTER! (THE BOLT HEAD THAT IS)"
3,Concept good...but,"You have to ensure you have the right size. So far, it does NOT fit around anything I have.I purchased it to help me get the washer thing off the kitchen sink neck thingy...but it is too small."
3,Think small,"I always liked the idea of these things, but they need to be smaller to get into tight places. Never will replace my power drill."
2,Zombie Planet...let's have some more zombie action!,"This movie seemed incapable of moving (and considering I can tolerate anything as long as there's a strong finish) or going anywhere.This is mainly about two groups of people: the ""upper class"" (Bad People!) versus...well, the not upper class, in a movie about carb diets turning people into zombies, but the zombies seem to have little to do with the two groups of people fighting over dominion, food, and their personal safety--which could be cool, but done very boring and without a climax.Bottom line:Little gore, plot sucks, it lasts almost two hours, and for what, I keep asking myself, since there is no final battle with zombies vs. people, and finally, if you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least grace us with some nudity.Skip this one."
1,GREAT IDEA BUT BAD MOVIE,I thought the idea of how the zombie craze started was great. Ano carb diet pill gone bad. But the movie itself was so bad that I have to say I've seen better acting in porn movies. NowI know it had a low budget but this really sucked.
4,Zombie Planet is Fun,"Zombie Planet Stays true to the Zombie Genre. It is Fun and action packed with very good make-up effects. Most of the planet has died as a result of a drug made to reduce carbo craves, people taking the drug turn into flesh eating zombies. the hero, ""Kane"" a nomad, fights his way through a city of zombies to save an outcast group of people known as the dregs. Kane does battle with the ""Upper Class"" leader, Adam, who controls the walled ""safe zone""...all hell breaks loose, and plenty of blood.If you like zombie movies, you'll like Zombie Planet. New-comer Frank Farhat does a great job as the mysterious Kane, and Matt Perry plays the evil Adam.great special effects by Sven Granlund and Linda Goforth.Zombie Planet has won an award for ""Best Special Effects"", at the NY Independant Film feastival in 2003"
2,Needs More Zombie Action!!!,This movie has a okay plot but just some really bad actors.The acting below average the set is good but the actors need help. It just seems to drag on with little action. I really thought this movie would take off but it just stood their the whole time. I'm really surprised there is going to be a second one. I paid $17.00 Dollars for this I really wish I did'nt. There are better films out their I suggest take a chance on something else.
2,A classic 80s Style B-movie,"What more do you want? A cool hero who can kick butt fighting zombies and Mad Max style bad guys (secretly backed by a military conspiracy) in a post-apocalyptic world. I bought this movie and I can't wait to see the sequal. I don't understand some of these bad reviews (what you expected a big budget thriller? named Zombie Planet?) To me it was a great B movie. It reminded me of some great B-movies from the 80s (Huminoids from the Deep, Vampire Hunter). I especially liked that it is not your typical kids in a cabin movie. Kudos for some originality. Really, my only disappointment is that there was not more T & A and that some of the actresses (other than Jamaica) could have been better looking."
1,THIS IS A BAD MOVIE,"FIRST OF ALL IT`S SO CHEAP I DON`T EVEN THINK THEY GET PAY FOR DOIN IT. THE ZOMBIES TALKS,AND THE ZOMBIES FIGHT WHEN IN THE HELL YOU SEE THAT IN OTHER MOVIES,THEY DON`T TALK OR FIGHT THEY JUST FEED FROM HUMAN FLESH ,AND THE PLOT,THE CAST EVRETHING IS DO WRONG 24.99 IT`S LOT OF MONEY,EVEN IF YOU RENT IT FOR 3.99 IS A LOT OF MONEY, DON`T EVEN BURNED DON`T LOSE A DVD-R IN THIS MOVIE."
5,A well finished item~,"I greatly enjoy using this spoon. Nice and heavy, with smooth edges, it's very well made. A pair of these are great for serving salad."
2,Stainless CHINA???,"As a spoon its a pretty good product. The problem is that after the first use and washing, it is already rusting in spots. I really have no use for a spoon that rusts that easily in my kitchen touching my food. The product description says it is made of high quality 18/8 stainless steel. Whatever, stainless steel should not rust if it is considered HIGH QUALITY and this does. Not happy at all with this product."
1,Continuing Frustration,"I had a spoon from AMCO that was this design, but shorter. I gave it to a relative, thinking I could replace it.It was a favorite. WRONG. This spoon looks the same, but the steel is not nearly as strong. It bends veryeasily. I kept it, but now wish I hadn't. I hope this was just a bad batch. Customer beware."
2,fiction is not literature,"This novel is a slam-bang, hackneyed adventure story that focuses on a boring protagonist and stilted characterizations that are shallow and lacking any kind of soul. Bailey writes a simple novel for simple people more akin to a TV movie than an actual five-star novel. Lame one-liners abound in what passes for dialog and Bailey's descriptive ability provides little atmosphere as he keeps the plot speeding on so you don't actually think about what actually motivates these characters. Short chapters are often a symptom of poor writing (there are 30 in 180 pages of story) because the author has precious little substance to actually communicate to us about the situations which the characters are involved.Bottom line: a regular old dime-store novel that is not a timeless classic worthy of five stars."
5,I never knew about the war to the south.,"This book is an adventure, a wild ride, a plane crash to avoid a forced military landing, grab the bags of money and run. A tale of a person displaced, going on a vacation and end up killing for a cause. If you have ever been an occasional traveler in Mexico this book throws out a whole new twist, while teaching you some history about the Chiapas Indians and the Zapatista movement."
1,"The Firewire port works, the USB 2.0 does not","The USB ports do not work properly. I tried to connect an external USB 2.0 hard drive under Windows XP SP1, and had nothing but troubles. The system would hang up and crash. After transferring 2/3 of a 40 MB file, it just stops. The hard drive works as a miracle on my desktop with 25-30 MB/sec speed, so the problem is not the hard drive. The firewire port seems to be OK.Do not buy this card!"
1,Only one reason to possibly buy this card,"If you have a very light door and would like a high-tech door stop, this is the product for you. It doesn't work as a USB 2.0 or 1394 port, and tech support, while they were responsive and tried to be helpful, could not solve ANY of the problems. I'm on the verge of returning my iPod, just because I hate this product so much and I bought it to get my iPod to work."
5,Don't Let the Other Reviews Deter You From Buying,"Based on previous reviews, I was hesitant in buying this product. However, I went ahead and pulled the plug. I tested both the firewire and USB ports on this card with an External DVD writer and they both worked fine! I am running the card on a Dell Latitude C640 Laptop with Windows XP Pro SP1. I did not install the drivers that came with the card. Windows XP Pro recognized everything fine.I originally bought this card at a Major Retail Electronics Store for $80...that's when I saw Amazon advertise it for $56 shipped. I took back the first one, ordered the SIIG card from Amazon and saved $$$.Just remember that people will post negative comments a lot more than positive ones!!!"
1,BIG trouble,"I bought this card to use it with Dell Inspiron 4100, WinXP and Dell Inspiron 7500 Win98SE. The card worked under WinXP, but was NOT hot-pluggable. The card did not work in any way with Win98SE. The customer service from SIIG was impossible to reach by e-mail, and did not have 1-800 number. The tech support they offered was bogus - they tried to offer all kind of practical advice but had no clue why their product did not work. The representative had a strong accent and it was difficult to understand each other.Amazon were kind enough to accept the card back and return me the money."
1,same problem,"I am using IBM ThinkPad T30, running Window XP Profession. I just encountered the same problem as described by the first reviewer. Everyone who plans to use this device should bear the potential problem in compatibility in your mind. Good Luck!"
5,The Maltese,It is a very detailed book regarding the Maltese breed and what is expected of a show dog. I don't intend to show my puppy but I enjoyed the book and will keep it for reference.
3,"Great product, crappy tube!","i bought this product to make a water partition in a 29 gallon tank. i cut the nozzle down on the 3rd mark from the top to allow a thicker better flow of the silicone. i put down a thick line on one side of the plexiglass went to do it to the other side and the hole bottom part of the actual tube bursted open and it all came out. i had to put what came out on a plate and put on what i could with my finger. the rest on the plate is useless and wasted.the actual silicone that i was able to use was great, easy to apply, and clean off. the oder was tolerable, and it was untacky in about an hour. the complete curing time for this is about 48 hours. like i said, great product, but the tube needs to be upgraded and made better."
4,Works well,"We have two large rain barrels which I purchased at the end of last year. When I installed them this spring I found a tiny leak near the top. Rather than deal with the manufacturer and shipping big barrels back and forth, I figured I'd just seal it and be done with it. I found this product and chose it because it is food safe which is important since the water is primarily used to water our garden. It definitely worked, but I knocked a star off because the bottom seam of the tube opened and the sealant exploded all over the place. I'm not sure what the deal was with that but I was able to accomplish what I needed with it."
2,Cracked Cap Rendered Product Useless,"Hate to leave reviews like this -- but after exactly TWO uses, the cap cracked and the entire tube congealed, rendering it completely useless. Contacted manufacturer via email and asked for a replacement, never heard anything back. NOT happy."
1,Tube bursted open,The tube exploded in my hands. Got more of the stuff on my hands than the project and pretty much ruined it. I know it's a good product because it took me over an hour getting the stuff off my hands after but I cannot give it more stars because it was useless for its intended purpose.
2,Not worth it,"I have to agree with the other reviewers--the sealant part works great, but the packaging pretty much ruins it. I couldn't get the sealant to come out of the tip, and I ended up squeezing so hard that the bottom of the tube burst and coated my hands in the stuff. Not fun."
5,Does the job!,"This is a stout step and is sure to last a long time, plus it looks nice on my truck. I would recommend this to my friends."
3,Average Tongs,"Tongs seem to be well constructed, nylon coated tips are nice. Only complaint is that handle locking isn't very sturdy. They easily open, lock closed because metal piece moves so freely."
1,They don't lock?!,"I saw these tongs while browsing and noticed the great review. I was looking for nylon tongs, since I had recently purchased a nice set of stainless steel cookware.Well, when I got them home, I realized they did not LOCK! I didn't thick of this while reviewing different tongs - I thought it was a default to have tongs that locked.Aside from not locking, they were awkward to use. They were too large to handle shrimp or thin cuts of meat.After a few months I tossed these for a nice set of nylon OXO tongs, which LOCK and work well for all types of meats and usage."
3,its ok,found these thongs a little hard to use. tryed picking up some large pork chops and had a lot of problems holding them. Had to grab them about half way up to hold on.
1,Amco Stainless-Steel and Nylon Locking Tongs,"They are acceptable as one can use them w/ non-stick cookware. They were the only tongs I was able to find for use w/ non-stick cookware, when I ordered them last year.They do not grip well at all: the ""gripping"" parts shift when you try to grip something. They also have really sharp edges on all the stainless steel parts. I expected a better quality from the Amco brand. BTW, the locking mechanism works just the opposite than most other ""regular"" tongs I have used + the mechanism also unexpectedly disengages by itself..."
3,Loose lock causes frustration,"I agree with other reviews complaining about the lock on these tongs. The lock is very loose and annoying. But, for the price, I'm content with them."
5,I consider this the most important book I've ever read,"I read this book over 10 years ago and it's created my basic philosophy in life. I read many, many books each year and whenever I find a great truth somewhere else it's almost always already been mentioned in this classic. This book empowers, brings confidence, makes life more exciting and gives you all the info you need to know to build the life you want for yourself. It may seem like I'm over stating this, but this book really is that good."
5,Read it for yourself.,"Regardless of the source of the information, the information in the book is well worth reading and thinking about. It may take a little bit to get ""in"" to it, but stick with it a little while and see for yourself how much ""sense"" it makes."
2,Practical? Not very.,"I feel I'm reading the same vague notions over and over and over. The notes where Seth has stopped and the writer starts are annoying. I don't care what time it was when the session started and I don't care about the superfluous details of the couple's lives who bring the Seth material to print. I don't need that to ""authenticate"" the ideas. It's cumbersome. I feel a bit talked down to at best, punked at worst. I respect those who have gained insight from this material. It just doesn't work for me."
1,What a waste of time and money!!,"Reading this book can only be described of as a chore. This was not written well at all, and it is delivered in a very annoying way. The information in this book is very dated, and only repeats topics that are described in other books of this category. After I finished reading it, I threw it in the trash. There are not many books that I would throw out."
2,"IFS, ANDS AND BUTTS","This was my first 'Seth' book, and possibly my last. I bought it on the recommendation of several reviewers who I admire and whose views I respect. The style and tone of the book, with its frequent and vacuous anotations by Jane Robert's partner and co-author Robert F Butts, I found irritating in the extreme. Why not simply present the text, free of such superficial and inane additions? There was a lot of repetition, and what material of value that is contained in this book - and I don't dispute there is some - is thereby rather snowed under by unnecessary text. 'Seth' - or is it Jane? - likes to smoke tobacco and drink beer whilst channelling this information - how very Seventies! Overall, I found this book to be rather a bore as well; my attention flagged badly towards the end. A distinct case of ""yeah, whatever"" I'm afraid. Yes, of course there is the odd gem to be found in its pages, but one has to mine seams of utter dreariness to stumble across them."
4,Very good ...but...,"I thought this book was good for those who already have a little knowledge. I certainly DO NOT condone the use if a Ouiji board, and many New Age writers will tell you the same. It seems to connect with those on the lower levels, and anything can be floating around down there! If you want a more ""reality"" based book on the same theme, try C.R.U.M.B.S. by Matthew O'Malley, it is his thoughts from his life, not a ""Seth"" from who knows where. If you know your stuff, and know protection, read the book. If you are just starting, try some others first!"
1,I can't understand what the fuss is all about?,"I have read many books on spirituality, but this book is one of the worst books on the subject I came across. There is no doubt that there is a great need among many people to know something about the fundamental questions of life, but unfortunately there is a load of rubbish around masquerading as ""The Truth""!. If you want the genuine article, read ""The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception"" by Max Heindel. You'll be doing yourself a great favour!."
5,My Bible,"I'm sorry to offend anyone, but I consider this book to be my bible...I have read this book so many times that I couldn't fathom to count. The information presented in this book is being proved daily with discoveries in quantum physics and on TV. I can remember seeing a story on a popular news program about transplant patients taking on some of the characteristics of the organ donor. Guess what? Seth talks about the fact that each of our cells have its own consciousness. Each time I read the book or Seth's other material the material goes deeper and deeper into my core. Reading the book actually opened me up to OBE type experiences with the buzzing in the ear and the like. I am a faithful and this knowledge has done wonders for me in my health, happiness and career. It sometimes takes a few reads to totally grasp the concepts but once you do you are well on your way in life. I would love to get my hands on a hardback of this book. Good Luck Readers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Profound, Life-Changing","It is really a shame that the Seth books, like the Edgar Cayce books, get pigeonholed into the ""New Age"" or ""Occult"" sections of bookstores, thereby attaching a certain negative stigma to them.The Seth books should be read by everybody. If you are even the least bit a ""seeker,"" then I heartily recommend this profound work. I can say, without a doubt, that the Seth books are truly life-changing. The term ""life-changing"" has become an overused cliche, but in this case, it is true."
5,read it over and over again,"I've read this book many times (lost count of the number) because of depth of the information about existence and our relationship to ""All That Is"". It's the kind of book that can truly alter one's life in very dramatic ways. Jane Roberts/Seth were pioneers of so much of the ""new age"" literature that has come our way over the last couple of decades or more. Read just about any page in this book and get ""blown away"". Buy this book if you want to see a new way of looking at the Universe and your relationship to it."
5,Excelent timeless knowledge!,"This is the kind of book that one can read over and over and always discover something new,the Seth books provide information and knowledge to be studied for a lifetime(s). I have enjoyed this book because it always brought me back to my self,no need to blame others,it provided me with a great sense of self-worth and a rather impatient curiosity to know the ""secrets"" of the universe and of myself."
5,Lifechanging Book,I am not even half way through this book yet and already I am looking at the world so much more differently.
4,A Classic,I have read a lot of books on consciousness and this is the realm of the best in the sense that it says it like it is for the the most part without all the fluff of so many of these type of books.....yes very good.
5,It should be a required reading for all hypnotherapists,"I've been planning to read this book for years before I actually got to it and I'm very glad I read it. One of the reasons I was postponing reading this book is that I generally don't rush to buy ""channelled"" books - there are very few of those that I really like and this one is one of them.It's a good book from from the perspective of psychology, metaphysics, and hypnosis - and even if you are well-versed in these areas and you know them inside out, you can still benefit from reading this book.The book deals in great depth with beliefs. As a hypnotherapist and metaphysician, I am extremely well-aware of the role they play in creating one's experience of reality and it is amazing that there are no hypnosis books that have dealth so thoroughly and insightfully with beliefs (nope, not even Dilts' book on Beliefs).Now that I've read this book - I think it should be a required reading for all hypnotherapists."
2,Hard to read,This is a very profound book but I found it almost impossible to read. Lots of underlining and out-takes means the text doesn't really flow. If you love detail and have patience then you may appreciate it much more than I did.
5,An absote MUST to understand yourself and reality,"Although the author uses a very educated vocabulary, he explains with many examples how Reality is just what we decide to make of it. The core of the book resides in that ""We make our own Reality"" and this is done through BELIEFS.We perceive everything (our own Self included) through the focus of our beliefs and we act CONSTANTLY according to them. They forge our values, emotions, imagination and, ultimately, all our decisions. Still, we can change them and alter our reality. Seth gives some tips on how to do it.Many topics discussed in this book can easily be digested even if you're not into the New Age thing and don't believe in ""channeled book dictation"". For those who do, there are still many surprises to uncover..."
5,Nice book,"I bought this book for personal use, I was concerned it might not be the correct one, but it was and I'm glad I found it cheaper here."
4,Stokowski conducts Tchaikovsky,"Recorded in glorious Phase 4 Stereo, the two ballets are performed with a spirit and lightness that is sadly missing in performances of todays conductors. The only thing listeners may object to, is the re-written ending of Romeo and Juliet. Stokowski did not believe that the romantic tone poem should end in loud, crashing chords, rather, he believed the death of the two characters should be handled peacefully. So Stokowski re-wrote the ending using strings and a mild cresescendo to express death quietly. This re-written ending violates the letter of the score. If you don't mind the re-scored ending, the disc as an entirety is excellent!"
1,BEWARE! Not nylon coated,"While not in this particular item description here on Amazon and elsewhere these Amoco utensils are described as stainless steel with nylon coated business ends, be it spoon, spatula, or ladle. None of them are in my experience. The business end here is small and flimsy nylon mold with a thin metal handle stuck into it. Even so I find it useful and for the price and not worth bothering to return.If there was a actually a sturdy, full stainless steel utensil with a nylon coated working end I would be interested in trying it out.Amoco (an/or their distributors) get a big fat zero for deceptive advertising even though this utensil is not complete junk."
2,spoon,"very dissapointed in this item, I was expecting a larger/longer utencil but it was similar to what you might find at the local Doller store.Not recommended for the price."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"Looks like it would be a great spoon in the picture, so between that and the reviews, I bought it. It is worse than the things I was hoping to replace. Not only that, some reviewer mentioned for the stainless steel model (same spoon, just no nylon) that it is a lunch lady's spoon. The line is NOT. The scoop of the spoon is so tiny that it is useless. When you add the flimsiness to it, they're worthless for cooking a huge potful of heavy eats."
1,The only thing it hit had was my wallet,"I was excited to get this game, because I've always been a fan of tennis games. HOwever, when i received this game i was thoroughly angered. All characters are fictitious, which i wouldnt mind if the controls were more accurate and the game had a good selection of playing options. I find that your characters cannot run around the court like your opponents do, so your basically hitting random buttons trying to 'outwit' the computer. The gameplay is either tournament style, or three mini-games. I did not like this game at all"
4,good game,"good game , easy controls, gets really tougher at levels 5 and abovegood to play with multiplayer"
3,Great game - but it doesn't play on all playstations,I have one of the older PS2's that I purchased a few months after U.S. release. This game will not play on my PS2 but will play on the newer (slim-line) PS2's.
2,Don't buy it!,"I bought this tennis game. As far as the gameplay, it is pretty good. The rest of it sucks! The movements and expressions of the players aren't realistic and they look fake.It seems like a product that they spat out to make money.If you want a HOT tennis game for PS2. Get Sega Sports Tennis! You'll love it!Comparing the pictures on the covers between hardhitter and SST (sega sports tennis), you'll want to get hardhitter. But once you play SST (the controls are easier too), you'll love it! Also, the announcing is realistic and not annoying like in hardhitter.Oh yeah, i usually play tennis games without the soundtrack, but sst has a soundtrack that fits great !Get Sega Sports Tennis !"
2,This game stinks!!!,"First of all, i play tennis in real life. I play for my highschools tennis team. This game is kinda like playing tennis in real life. But whatever happened to 15-love? The single player mode only does tie breakers. That is not a real tennis game. They could have done alot better. The controls stink too. It would be much easier to control the character with the control pad instead of the stick. The players are also unresponsive to your controls. It is impossible to get the highest ranking, unless you have a character that is super good. I do not recomend this game. It is a waste of money. Buy something else.(...)"
4,"Very Gripping, Powerful and Sad","As a cruising sailor I was hesitant to read this book - knowing that it would not have a happy ending. However, it was truly a fascinating story because it takes you through a journey that had to be real and not fiction. It makes you contemplate whether you would have had the strength and knowledge to survive under such terrible circumstances. A must for all cruisers to read - it will make all of you be much more concerned about safety and weather conditions and teaches the importance of boat knowledge. This book teaches that you can't take life for granted."
5,Very Informative,"I loved this documentary, it gives real insight into the mind and motives of Ingrid Newkirk and really demonstrates her passion and compassion for all animals."
5,Wonderful DVD! Ingrid Newkirk is my idol.,"This is an inspirational, touching documentary that will help people understand the animal rights movement. I've always admired Ingrid Newkirk for her compassion, insight, dedication, and courage, and this DVD did not disappoint me. ""I Am an Animal"" will open your eyes and help you to make more compassionate choices."
5,A documentary that everyone needs to see.,"This is a wonderful documentary. It shows the truths about PETA and the causes they stand for. It also shows the true cruelty of the fur and meat industries. After watching this documentary, you will hopefully have an enlightened perspective of why PETA members work so hard to bring hope to abused, tortured, and neglected animals. We try to suppress what goes on behind closed doors. When we sit down at the table and eat, do we ever contemplate what the animal went through before it graced your table? Of course not. We'd rather pretend that everything is OK but the truth is that everything is not OK. Please for your sake and the sake of all of God's creatures watch this documentary. It may change your life or at least enlighten you to think differently about the choices you've made regarding animals."
3,Must see! Will change your thoughts on PETA!,"I must say, as a person who works in animal rescue, I couldn't wait to see this movie! I went into it disliking PETA and came out of it absolutely hating them! They are the funding for ALF, they blow up laboratories, they do everything they do for attention and they expect to be taken seriously? Please, Ingrid, hang it up, you are starting to embarrass yourself further..your bullying tactics are obnoxious and the end does not justify the means. The most offensive part? PETA comparing Concentration Camp victims to cows..it's anti-semitic, it's inflammatory and it's ridiculous. Yes, after seeing this movie I joined three anti-peta groups so I guess it was a good thing."
2,I thought dis game would be nice,"this game is borin. after reading yall reviews i thought this game would be nice.the graphics is garbage, defense is bad,the shooting is way to easy, and the starting of the game is bad. RENT IT DONT BUY IT."
4,Worst basketball game ever,"When I went to the store looking for basketball games this was the cheapest one so I got but It has bad graphics,only one rookie player on each team, so there are no second rounders or ect. 989 sports make bad games except for football games.The commentry is real bad. Players start to twicth. no real actuall player numbers for example Amare Stoudimire's number is 32 in the game its 40. Its a real disapointment."
2,CAN SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A GOOD BASKETBALL GAME?,"Well, I must say this game is terrible. When you're playing a game, the center and each of the forwards on the other team have about 10 blocks per game. The moves are useless, and you can get near the basket about 10% of the time. If you do get to the basket, the defender blocks your shot about half of the time. The career mode's concept is good, but when you create your player, you have to use just the right combinations to keep your player from looking like a freak. Also, the AI was killing me on career mode because difficulty was set to VETERAN. I went back to the main menu, switched to ROOKIE, started another career mode, and sure enough, it was back on VETERAN. I tried this multiple times, but had no luck. Rent it and see what you think."

3,Porsche 911SC by Bentley Publishers,"A helpful book but over rated in my opinion. Many of the illustrations could be greatly improved, enhanced and enlarged to extrapolate upon the often complex instructions. I use this in conjuction with Wayne's book "" 101 Projects etc "" and have acheived good results. Having said that this book has more technical information and schematics on most of the electronic issues than can often plague your car. I would buy both Wayne's book and this one and use them together for the best results."
2,911 comments,"This is the type of manual I have been looking for, its great. Great price, if you have one of these cars and want to know about it, buy this book."
2,Rena Riffel's Trasharella,"I am a big fan of Rena Riffel, but she needs to stick with acting.The film was ( probably intentionally ) grainy, and for no reason I can see.Try watching her in Bound Cargo or Dark Confessions ( both filmed in eastern Europe with few English speakers, but still much better )"
1,It's not set as A440,"I never write reviews but I felt like I needed to write one becuase I was mislead by other reviews. This keyboard may be okay if you want a cheap keyboard to play with but if you want to use it for any musical purpose, you should invest in another one. I took this to an audition I was judging thinking it's portable and I can just give the starting pitch to the singers... I was horrified to find out that it is not set as A440. It was about half step lower than the piano... I almost screwed up the whole audition!!So if you want to use it as a toy, than it's fine. But this is poorly made and it's not set in the correct key."
5,GRANDDAUGHTER'S FAVORITE,My daughter in law tells me my 3 year old granddaughter won't go anywhere without it. I want to be the music grandma so this is a dream for me! And her mom is grateful I supplied headphones.
3,drop this company/FOLLOW-UP DESERVES ATTENTION TOO,We purchased portable roll up piano keyboard through Amazon from Begum9. When the product arrived we realized that some of the keys did not work and some of the features also did not work. Included in the package from a previous recipient of this same product complaining that it was being returned because it did not work for the same reasons. I originally wrote that Begum9 should be dropped from Amazon as a vendor. I contacted Begum9 to complain. They immediately sent me a new unit. My apologies to Begum9. Not Happy is Happy to deal with a company that stands behind its products.Portable Roll Up Piano Keyboard - JB4509JB4509
3,piano keyboard,"""keys"" not as responsive as notmal keyboard. Somewhat sluggish response. Overall performs the task i need it for. Not performance quality."
1,bad,This was a gift for my daughter so she can practice while we are away from home but it had a bunch of keys that did not work. Sent it back.
2,Never worked,"This was a major purchase Christmas present for my grandson who is impatiently waiting for me to send the never working keyboard back for a new one that plays. Buying such an exciting instrument that was defective is the only reason I don't like it, I am sure we will be thrilled when we have a piano that makes music."
3,"my son is 8 he really likes it, it's a bit dodgy though.",As I said my son is 8 and really likes it. It is a bit dodgy. It has to be on a very flat surface to work properly.He still like it though. The head phone feature is great!!! So when he practices I don't have to hear it unless he needs help.Over all as a toy its a 4. Saving me from needing a piano its a 7.
4,great product,"It is a great product and fun for my son. Easy to travel with, seems durable so far. So we will see later as we go!"
4,Roll-Up Piano,"Product arrived faster than I expected. It has more features (sounds, tempos) than I had expected. For some reason our cats do not walk on the keyboard and that is a plus."
1,"Piano, or Dying Soprano? ( pun intended )","Dying Soprano. The reason I purchased this, is so I can have my own little piano for lunch. It would be convenient to have... If it worked. For the quality of the product, no lie it should have been 5 bucks. It was shipped to me very nicely and looked neat. When I opened it I was excited. The power on button was a bit of a turn-off, but hey I got a Roll up Piano, Man! Then I turned it on. :(. It most definitely a horrendous sample for piano. I turned to the marimba and that one was pretty nice. I went through the notes and my heart was further oppressed. At least 7 VITAL notes were dysfunctional. They only worked if middle C worked, rarely. Then out of the blue they started to work. Then Another 5 VITAL notes were permanently disabled,unable, heinous, horrendous, Horrid, Morbid... just bad. So I shipped that sucker back and got a full refund.That is my complaint and thanks for listening. (applause, applause) ""Oh, your to kind."""
2,Pretty flimsy,The piano does not include a power cable so you must use batteries. The rubber mat stays lumpy and doesn't lay flat
1,Not Disclosed,I did not know I ordered a roll up piano with only 37 keys. Beware. Check out the specs carefully. Still can't find when the number of keys are disclosed.Portable Roll Up Piano Keyboard - JB4509JB4509
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,This keyboard is garbage. I bought two of them. I couldn't connect them to my Mac with a regular MIDI-USB cable or even a special music computer cable made especially for the job. One of the keyboards played really strange sliding notes right out of the box and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. The other broke after rolling it up a few times and started playing one note repeatedly. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. It's junk.
4,Great for a toy piano keyboard,"Due to my limited funds, I got a 37 key Rollup Piano. That was a mistake. I didn't have enough keys to play one of my favorite songs. I should have waited until I could afford one with more keys. I couldn't straighten the keyboard out to where it would lie flat due to the way it was folded in the original box. I would suggest the manufacturers store it in a drum-shaped box to keep from having it permanently folded and unable to lie flat. The sound was good, although some keys required a heavier touch to play them. It's a good keyboard to learn on and a good substitute for a piano in Sunday School. I listened to the various accompaniment rythms, and they would be good for secular songs, but most of them are not so great for Sunday School."
1,This product SUCKS!!!,"I whish I could do a proper review of this product but since IT WONT EVEN TURN ON, there is not much I can say about its sound and how the keys work. luckily my 7 year old had other presents to entertain herself this christmas. Dont waste your money on this piece of crap."
3,pros and cons,"I purchased this in a pinch to use in a class teaching how to play piano by ear. I suspect it's important to be gentle with it so the sound contacts remain intact so the notes continue to play. All the notes worked. All keys are true to pitch in relation to each other. As a teacher of playing piano by ear, it is important that notes are true to pitch. Where this toy is NOT true to pitch is when compared to a piano. The ""C"" note on the toy is a ""B"" on the piano, 1/2 pitch low. Not a traumatic issue. For the majority this should be fine as it is a toy and I am comparing it in a professional situation. Could be a good starter for kids as I hear not all roll up keyboards have notes that are true to pitch with each other and this one is pretty close."
2,"Just like a toy, can't used to practice","1. After I put 4XAA battery, the lid can't be closed normally.2. It can't be used to practice for professional skills. Sounds awful and wierd."
3,Not again?,This toy was very choppy when using the keys and really only useful for songs you already know. Very limited space so you can't play so gas with two hands and if you do there will be a sharp pitch noise on the middle of your note. Wouldn't advised purchasing this item
3,carry bag and adapter,"The box doesn't inclode the carry bag and the Dc adapter, so it should always run only with the batteries"
2,Defective keys,The keyboard had a tinny sound so I wasn't that happy with it to begin with but I sent it back after it started adding discordant notes when I played chords.
3,Tranee/Children Training Piano and Video Editing Sound Effects Creator; Rollable,"I bought the Portable Roll Up Piano Keyboard-JB4509JB4509 from Amazon. It truly shipped well protected from damage and was delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery day.The package came without a charger. I had to buy one from Amazon. The Piano has the basic things that a beginner trainee in piano needs for a start. It is also good for simple uses for a professional. It has good sound out put speaker and can be connect to a home theater for better sound out put. It has many tones and rhythms to choose from. It is very soft touch.This is a very good sound creator for VIDEO EDITING. The video editor can creatively add very good sound effects of his choice and creation, to his movie using this toy.It is very good for its price."
2,roll-up piano,I travel and I'm a songwriter and this roll-up keyboard is perfect for coming up with basic melodies. Doesn't take up much space in a suitcase.
3,Piano Keyboard roll up,Sounds tinny but good for practicing while away from home and a real piano. We used it on spring break vacation.
3,"Not for real piano practice, just for fun tinkering","Got this for my son last year who is taking piano lessons. Thought it would be fun to take when we travel, thought maybe he could do some practicing on it.This piano isn't much good for practicing, but it is great for ""messing around with"" and for a toy. My son does like playing with it.It has built in melodies, songs and rhythms you can use, and you can play it as a piano or chose different ""instruments"" or sounds.The drawback to this piano is that the on off button is easily tripped and that can be annoying when travelling with it or in a toybox if something touches it. For ours, I sewed a pouch for it to rollup into to prevent that problem.Also when playing it, it needs to be on a completely flat hard surface or it will not work correctly. We do have some keys that tend to work better than others, some you have to press harder to get them to play.It still works after a year though - so it has that going for it."
2,rollup piano,"Yes it is a toy but not too durable in small hands.the folding of the piano in packaging has made a permanent fold with lump, it will not lay flat causing a wrong sound on that key.I was looking for a piano my kids can practise their lessons on but this roll-up is damaged .I waited this long to see if fold would unfold but it hasn't . I need another with more keys and to lay flat.I would like to return this one and get a more key one with no packaging damage.ketty"
1,Don't waste your time,This is a cheap product. I wasn't expecting much but I did at least expect it to turn on when I put 4 brand new batteries in it.
1,Toy never worked and was returned.,This toy never worked. The batteries we installed were brand new and tested at full charge. The little piano would not turn on. We tried 3 different sets of batteries just in case. All gave the same results. The toy was defective and would not work. It was returned for a refund.
4,Not bad for the price.,"The Tools activity set isn't bad for the price. My two year old like to plays with it off and on during the day. He mainly likes putting the shapes in the correct holes. The sound is a little loud when he spins the small gears in the tool box. It comes with a few tools, hammer, power drill and a few others.He can use the hammer to pound in the nails or use the screwdriver to screw in the screws. It a good toy for hand and eye coordination."
4,Perfect for my 1 year old,"Got this as a gift for my 1 year old, and he loves it. The drill makes the drill sounds when you press it into anything, so he doesn't need the dexterity to press the trigger yet. Also, the other tools are a great size for him. The Shapes can be hammered into the orange sorter and then it ""says"" the shape name. The sounds are appropriate, and not overwhelming. I am not a fan of battery operated toys, but I love this set and more importantly, so does my son. Only 4 stars instead of five because when closed, the tool box doesn't sit up straight because the hinges to the box are on the outside... kind of annoying."
3,tool activity set,"Bought this product for a two year old. He does not seem that interested in it but may show more interest when he is older. Overall the product is okay, wouldn't buy again and not worth the shipping."
2,mislead by the great reviews,"Poorly designed toy. Not everything fits in for storage, screws and ""nails"" do not come out making full rotation impossible. Really disappointed with this toy and its design."
2,Does not come with inset in top of lid depicted in photos,"This is a good toy, and fun to play with. But it does not come with the plastic insert in the lid, that is in some (although not all) of the photos. If it did the tools would clip into the lid, and it would be a much better toy. As it is it's hard to arrange the tools inside so that you can close the box, and a child certainly can't do it. When they open the case the tools are all over the place. My kids still love it, but it annoys me that the advertising, here, on the company website and on the packaging depicts something which you don't get, and that would make it a much better toy."
2,Drill only makes noise,the drill does not move. needless to say we returned it and purchased one by Fisher Price. We were satisfied with Amazon's return policy :]
3,It's alright ...,"At first I was disappointed with this toy because I was hoping it would be more ""life like"". I realized that it was built with kids in mind so they don't choke on anything. The biggest thing I don't like about this is trying to store all the tools it comes with inside the toolbox. My son tries to close the box and if the tools are not placed in precise locations I have to stop him from forcing it closed because it looks like he's going to break it altogther. This is definitely made for the younger crowd (2 -3 years of age)."
3,It's ok,"It's a great idea, but not quite what I was expecting. Quality lower than Fisher Price brand products. So, price a little high."
5,Fix-it Fun,"My 3 and 1/2 year old grandson loves this toy. He plays ""Bob the Builder"" and fixes the entire house. The drill makes noise and there is a recording that identifies the shapes as well as different sound effects when he pound the nails etc. The tools are the perfect size for toddler hands."
5,tools,bought it as a gift for the grandson. He loved it. Can't say his Mom did though. He tried to drill the chairs and hammer the cat
3,packaging is deceptive,"I was surprised to discover that the insert shown on the package which holds all the tools in place no longer comes with the toy, which makes for some annoying reconfiguration in order to get the box to close and for some messy crash of tools when the box opens. But it did a fair job of entertaining my toddler."
2,Not Worth the Money,"We asked for this tool set as a gift for our son's second birthday. The tool set looks more fun online, than it is in person. The drill bit doesn't go all the way in the drill, making it unrealistic...the hammer button doesn't seem to have enough function, and our kit is missing the white tray part that holds all the tools in the carrying case!!! We are very disapointed."
4,"Fun, take along set","My toddler daughter is fascinated by screwdrivers so I bought this little set for her but it's so interesting her big brother wants to use it too. I'm thinking about buying another one. Nice little toy with enough going on to hold a little one's interest. The latch should be easier to close and open for little fingers and there should be a way to hold the tools (drill, screwdriver, hammer, wrench) at the top as was pictured when I first bought it. It closes up so is easy to take with you anywhere you go. A lot of toy in a little space, we are really enjoying it!"
5,Great toy,"Our oldest son received this tool set when he was around 18 months old and he is still playing with it at 4 years. Our youngest son is now playing with it too. They are very rough with it, and it is still in one piece. The only negatives I have is that the tool holder shown in the picture did not come with it and the drill doesn't fit any of the screws (but the boys love it anyway). It is somewhat difficult for the kids to fit all of the tools in the box and close it correctly but that isn't a major concern."
1,false advertisement,Was charged over $12 shipping for something that was supposed to weigh 15lbs and ended up weighing less than one pound.
3,First Generator,I purchased this generator too use with our travel trailer to recharge the batteries and run the airconditioner. It works well and starts very easy. Only negative is that it has a higher noise level than some of the more costly units.
1,Do Not buy a Briggs and Stratton product,"I bought this generator one month ago yesterday. It NEVER RAN!!!!!!! I called this company for several days, so they told me to bring it to a service center. I did, well it turns out that the connecting rod was broke. The company refused to fix it because they said it was ran without oil. You can't run it without oil ,it has an oil sensor switch. So I bought this and now must hire a lawyer. SO MUCH for american manufacturing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!"
5,beginner,This video was really helpful. I had purchased other videos and was completely unsatisfied. This one explained movements better and goes through a warm up where as the others just told you to do a 45 warm up before starting the exercises. Very much worth the price.
5,Excellent Egyptian Style Belly Dance!,The teaching is clear and the instruction is focused on Egyptian Dance and well thought out!
3,VHS recommemded.,"This DVD version is not DVD player friendly. The entire movie is not divided into small chapters, so that it can't be jumped to play a particular part. You always have to play from start, menu screen doesn't exist. However, program is great! the best of all I've tried so far. I just regret..... I should have purchased VHS version, it wiil be less stressful to play with."
1,Bent the first time I used it,"I purchased this to stir boiled peanuts in a large stock pot. It was not rigid enough, it bent the first time I used it."
2,Lacking examples,"Learning the Bash Shell, should be not be called a learning book. The lack of real world examples really hurt this book. I found Unix Shells by Example a much better learning tool for the Bash Shell. This was surprising, since other learning books by O'Reilly are considerably better than this one."
2,Short on reference material and real world examples.,"This book does provide some help for BASH beginners, but lacks reference material and real world examples of BASH Shell programming. Any programming book SHOULD include real world examples OR complete reference material to be considered quality material. This book does NOT make the grade"
4,Good intro to bash shell,"This is a good place to start if you are looking into using the bash shell (unix). The book provides clear cut explanations of all of the commands present in the bash shell. The lack of examples is tolerable, though a little annoying when thoes ever-present half-understandings pop up and a quick example would clear it right up. Making up your own and testing it out works though.Unfortunately the shell scripting/programming part has been rendered rather useless by the up and rising use of perl for shell scripting. The sections still cover it, but most people scripting for unix shells are using perl because of its simplicity and power.Overall this is a great book to teach yourself the basics of the bash command line interface in unix, probably the best bash book out there."
4,So much good here,"There's a lot to love about this book, the way it helps the reader / programmer navigate the differences in the the different shell scripting settings.There's a lot to be desired, too. I too often felt the author believed I was an old hand at shell scripting, and he was offering some shortcuts.Why not assume I was a novice? Sure, some shell scripters would have howled; so what? Better too much exposition than not enough. I'd have appreciated more explanation of some of the tasks the author was accomplishing.Not bad, but could have been better."
2,Confusing,"I have been using UNIX for a few years, nothing too in depth, but I can get around. I recently went through the bookLearning the UNIX Operating System, Fifth Editionwithout any trouble and then moved onto the book in question. Starting with the third chapter I felt completely lost and had no idea what the heck the author was talking about. The examples are vague and unhelpful. I kept reading, however, and into the fourth chapter the confusion persisted. Perhaps if the author decided to include some hands-on examples and/or exercises I might understand the concepts better.I could see this being a worthwhile book if you know how to program already, but if you are just familiar with UNIX navigation, commands, (ie. anything in theLearning the UNIX Operating System, Fifth Editionbook) then you might be out of luck."
4,Very useful,"This book provided a solid resource to start writing shell scripts in bash. It is well written, and also provides understanding into some bash features that go beyond just a reference book."
2,Most disappointing O'Reilly book I've bought,"The authors spend so much space on extended examples that they make the basics difficult to find. The odd appearance of conditionals is, for instance, the most surprising thing about bash, at least for csh users; their explanation of it is separated by several pages from the main discussion."
2,Mediocre material lacking truly useful examples,"This book has many drawbacks: its structure is deficient, the division of the material is sometimes outright confusing, the content lacks rigor and clarity, the examples are badly chosen and there is an overall lack of unity and consistence throughout the book.Despite its many drawbacks, ""Learning the Bash Shell"" is still a useful book, simply because there are not that many alternatives. Moreover, the subject itself (i.e. the Bash shell, the Unix OS or both) is inconsistent and confusing."
2,Lack of easy-to-understand/basic shell-scripting examples,"This O'Reilly book teaches you the very basics of bash shell , but i found it very difficult without any good examples of scripts. The simplicity in explanation shown in the beginning of the book could not be found while we dwelved into the deeper areas , and a lack of good or easy-to-understand scripts put me off .Can anyone here suggest some other book with basic shell scripting examples ?thks in advance.."
5,Great for Reference,I discovered this book while taking a course on bash programming. I constantly use this book to reference topics - highly recommended for anyone looking to use the bash scripting language in Linux/OS X.
3,Overall a good book but...,Lot of good things in this book but it lacks examples and isnt practical enough... just one example: it does not say one thing about the 'shebang' (#!) though it is the first thing you should learn about bash....
2,"Buy the Dorati on its own, elsewhere","The only redeeming value this grabbag has are the excellent Dorati presentations. The rest is middlin' to start and it tapers off from there. It tapers very far with the raw sound of Horne and the at-sea concepts of a young Zubin Mehta who obviously recorded this material before he was ready. His LA Phil isn't anything to write home about, either, which makes you wonder how just a few years earlier it was so superb for Leinsdorf and Wallenstein.The manufacturer is just trying to make hay on some old recordings here. Dorati's are fairly recent, though, and you can buy his things elsewhere, so WHY would anyone want this?"
2,Cheap..does not line up,The design seems on the cheap side and when the bridge is down the track does not line up and the trains do not cross easily. This was a problem out of the box. After a child plays with the bridge going up and down a few times the problem is much worse.
3,"I love these shoes, but...","I love these shoes, but the soles really wear easily especially if you are a bigger man, such as myself. If you don't mind getting these resoled then you should really love them because besides this detail I really do love these shoes."
2,Cover Doesn't Match,"I needed to get the 7th edition for my class and the picture shown is the 7th edition, but in reality they send you the 5th which is a totally different one. I should've looked more carefully, but the picture is deceiving."
3,Itll do,I read this book for my Human Diversity and Societal Oppression class in graduate school. I found it to be an easy read with some very well written pieces. I enjoyed the format of the book which broke up the sub sections into manageable pieces (which was nice considering this book is pretty stout in size). All in all... an interesting read that will open your eyes to the struggles of others.
2,If you must...,"I had to read this book for a womens studies class. While I found there to be some interesting and enlightening parts, I found that it lacks objectivity. It often incorrectly blends broad brush strokes of authors opinion with fact. Often, I found references to an issue(s) with absolutely no way to determine its validity. This book more often than not gives vent rather than instruct."
2,So NOT worth your money,"I'm sorry but this film is [junk]. It only gets two stars because I feel sorry for ALYSSA MILANO (why I got the video in the first place). Alyssa is the only one who can act, but shes shoved into a small, unchallening role. You know the storyline - cops wife is killed, cop mopes around, cop goes back to work only to have son framed for another murder. Throw in some guns, topless women (not Alyssa), and pointless sex scenes. The result? The most boring movie of all time."
3,All right for bored people,"I won't give away much about this movie, but I will say, borrow it from a friend before you splurge and buy it. You may find yourself disappointed with this one."
2,Inferior Rathbone,"I loved Rathbone's ""Spy of the Old School"" and ""Eurokillers"".(Only two I've read.)This one is way below those in quality -contrived plot and lacking the political/espionage intrigue of those two gems."
5,Incredible Victory - Used copy,"This is one of the standard works about the Battle of Midway June 4-6, 1942. It was written as a popular postwar history in 1967. It combines extensive research with some folksy touches in the narrative. It is very good. The serious reader will also want to read a more recent and perhaps more scholarly study of the battle. Since Incredible Victory was published much more work has been done on this subject and some of the accepted truths about the battle, as it was understod in 1967, have been questioned, and disproved or further explained. I recommend The Shattered Sword by Parshall and Tully. Read both of these works.I bought a used copy and was very pleased with the condition of the used copy and the fast shipping."
4,War in the Pacific,Walter Lord does a wonderful job describing the battle of Midway. I loved the detail he included about the participants both american and Japanese.
5,Fine Versions from Both American and Japanese Forces,Really a fine book. I especially liked the parallel American/Japanese versions of the Midway battle preparation and battle. Just so happens that I received an e-mail today showing the video prepared by John Ford of the battle. Have a look at this 8 minute video to round out the book. [...]
3,Destined to become a classic,Despite the book being writtten to suggest that the Japanese were less than competant.The book does give insight into the horrors and turmoil during WWII in the South Pacific.
4,Follow-up to Day of Infamy,"Walter Lord covered the attack on Pearl Harbor with his ""Day of Infamy"". With ""Incredible Victory"", Mr. Lord brings the same personal perspective of many of the Battle of Midway's participants. This is no dry narrative. The drama of the near miss aspect of this climactic battle is genuinely captured. Walter Lord has written three classic books of the sea, ""A Night to Remember"" (Titanic), ""Day of Infamy"" (Pearl Harbor) and ""Incredible Victory"" (Battle of Midway). Only Prange's books on the last two events are superior."
4,Like the History Channel?,"When I was in high school, one of my assignments as a junior was to write a term paper, no less than fifteen pages, for my english class. I chose to write about the battle of Midway, because I'd heard a little about the signal intelligence that helped the Navy to know where to concentrate the Pacific Fleet, and found this book as a spectacular example of a few days broken down into manageable pieces. Lord's stories describe the demise of the four Japanese carriers sent to destroy the US presence on the Midway atoll, as well as the courage of the American pilots, who lost 42 of 52 torpedo planes against the Japanese fleet before American dive bombers caught the Japanese off guard. Though long, despite all the damage I've done to my brain since high school, I still remember certain parts of this book, about the retirement of a portrait of the Emperor, or a group of airmen in the water, or the tension surrounding the doomed Lexington. Enjoy, history buffs."
1,High quality material but not accurate,"This is a nice heavy high-quality cup but it doesn't measure up, literally. Liquid or solid, it's not 2 cups but somewhere under 1 7/8."
4,Good Game With Minor Flaws 4.5 Stars.,this is a great rpg it has a few flaws but nothing to cry over the begining is action packed and finds you figthing for your life. Real time combat is a plus for any rpg this game has fairly good graphics {not FFX quality} but still good. the gameplay is good and the story is off the chart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not to brag but I am the rpg master and this almost almost topped FFX. Legaia 2 and Suikoden 3 are the only games that could top this awesome game.
5,Summoner 2,This was purchased as a Christmas present for my son. He has not seen it yet so it is difficult to rate.
2,Not even worth renting.,"I'll admit it. I was excited to play Summoner 2 at first, it being recommended to me by my cousin. After the first time I failed the first mission, I decided that I didn't want to admit that the camera angles sucked[were bad]attempts later, i was incredibly frustrated that I had died so many times due to simply the jerky camera. This aside, the anime like graphics and unrealistic attacks, I almost felt forced. And I thought comboes made you vulnerable for a moment! The final guy on the first level with the flaming sword attacks me with a double combo and pauses so as i go into attack he unleases the third part of the combo. The game is jerky and inconsistent. Summoner fans, I beg you not to play this game, or you will be spending the next few weeks in a dark corner of your room, wondering where your game had gone."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. It had some nice photos of window treatments, and thats about all. All of the interor design ""hints"" were typed sentences. I could have enjoyed nice photos of window treatments in a magazine for much less money."
2,Black Dahlia Avenger,The price is out of line for a ebookBlack Dahlia Avenger: The True Storyto charge a person more than nine or ten dollars for a ebook is hurting your chance of selling the product. Why buy a ebook when you can buy the same in a paper back and then give it to a friend. The book can then be passed on and for others to enjoy.
4,Interesting and informational,"This book was interesting reading and contained a lot of background information that I didn't know about other similar murders in L.A. during the same time period as ""Black Dahlia."" However, Mr. Hodel supposedly is lightning struck by the idea that his father might be a murderer after seeing photographs of a dark-haired girl that he concludes is Elizabeth Short.That's his starting point. How he came to that conclusion I have no idea, because neither of the photos looks anything like Beth Short. He eventually made some good points with the handwriting comparison, but he should never have gotten that far. He keeps repeating that he has ""proven"" that George Hodel did this and did that, but I didn't see any proof other than his insistence that he ""knew"" it was so.This book is certainly worth reading although I didn't feel the mystery had been ""solved."""
1,A Load Of Baloney!,"I'm an ardent Black Dalhia fan and read everything written on the subject. This book is an utter fraud! The author doesn't present a single fact or piece of evidence to support his theory that his father killed poor Beth Short. What he does present is a deliberate pack of lies. What a rotten way to get back at his dead father! He claims authorites found his father's wristwatch at the crimescene. In fact, a local teenager found a man's wristwatch hundreds of yards from the crimescene. It probably had nothing to do with the killing. This is just one of hundreds of deliberate distortions throughout the book. The photos, handwriting analysis, etc. have already been drug across coals on this board. The ""thoughtprints"" (If I can think it it must be true) shows how delusional the author is. As for the person who said we're only trashing this book to promote our own ""pet theory"", yes, I do have my own pet theory. SOMEBODY ELSE DID IT!"
1,A mish-mash of speculation,A mish-mash of speculation and sloppy reasoning. His father was obviously a lousy selfish jerk who most likely molested his own daughter. However Hodel is a long way from proving that the man had anything to do with the Black Dahlia or any of the other murders he mentions.Save your money - buy John Gilroy's book and visit some of the websites about Elizabeth Short. John Douglas' The Cases That Haunt Us has an interesting section on the Black Dahlia.
1,"""MERETRICIOUS, REVOLTING TWADDLE""","So said Gary Indiana about this book in the Los Angeles Times. My hat is off to Gary Indiana! No one has sighted in with such a succulent description of this worhtless book. The author has accused his own father of all the famous unsolved, 1940's sex murders in Los Angeles, yet lacks one iota of actual proof. This is sick; it is ""meretricious, revolting twaddle,"" and belongs in the trash can with that other ""My Daddy Did It"" book. One wonders what sort of ""detective"" this ex-cop-turned-hack-writer could have been, and makes one awfully curious about the murder case he might've handled in the past. The less said about this trash the better."
1,A GENIUS FOR MENDACITY,"Hodel really piles it on in his new chapter - only this time it's a lttle higher and deeper. Ellroy errors in his Forward in believing that Elizabeth Short was in Hollywood on VJ-Day, August , 1945. According to the Police records at the DA's office she was in Cambridge, Mass. working at St Clairs with Marjorie Graham. Perhaps Ellroy should stick to fiction - like Hodel."
3,Wander Lust,"Hodel's book is often disjoined and poorly organized; however, the subject matter is facinating. Although many of the theories are not based in fact, the conjecture gives alternative explainations not explored in the original case. I would advise a reader to read this book when you are able to sit down and digest the material. Overall, Hodel's novel covers a facinating subject with style and content."
1,How to save $14.95 plus tax,"Anyone thinking of buying this book should first proceed to the bookstore, go to the Hodel pile, select a copy, and turn to page 45. Study the two pictures on this page, then turn back to the cover, where there's an actual picture of the victim, Elizabeth Short. If you think the two pictures on page 45 look like the picture on the cover, this book is definitely for you!Otherwise, drop it back on the pile, wipe off your hands, and leave the store quietly.Hint -- if you do decide the book is for you, and you drove to the bookstore, please take a taxi home, Mr. McGoo."
2,"I hate my daddy, therefore he's a serial killer","Dear Mr Hodel, I'm trying really hard to read your book with patience, understanding and compassion. My first comment is this: my father is a complete a**hole, a crook, a dishonest person, an uncaring, megalomaniac, amazingly self-centered prick, much like yours I suspect -- [Please note that I'm using two dashes, that makes me... The BDA, yikes! -- but that does not necessarily mean that he is a serial killer, OK?2nd instant thought: ever heard of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy, my friend? I grant you: writing a book might be less expensive inthe long run, but didya hafta publish it?And finally: the scariest thinh in all of this is that you were a cop, a detective no less, for many many years. Your logic process is one of the shoddiest I have EVER read [in itself, it merits to be examined in a philosophy/logic course, as the example of how NOT to apply logic reasoning) -- it's amazing that, as you claim, you ever caught anyone."
1,Less than one star,Just imagine you could fall down and die at any moment. You do not want this to be the last book you ever read. Give this one a wide berth.
2,Think Photos Are Important? Be Disappointed....,".... in seeing more than the dust jacket cover photo of Elizabeth Smart and two highly suspect ones inside from a 'hidden' cache associated with the prime suspect. But you do get lots of pics of the author's family, ad infinitum! What's the deal with a book about a juicy mystery without a suite of pictures of THE VICTIM? Not necessarily of the gruesome crime scene (although they should be included), but of Ms. Smart throughout her life and especially her adulthood. The text is highly speculative at best, and tailored to a set of preconceived notions. Not bad, but certainly not the definitive word on this fascinating murder."
1,UMMMMMMmmm.........,"I'll make this short. Ahh the pictures shown in the book that he found of ""Beth Short"", that were in his fathers possessions, well, is'nt Beth Short. They have as good a chance of being Jessie Jackson. Bye."
5,Exciting,From mthe first page on I was glued to this book.I love true crime and this one filled my need in a really good account.Well written
1,A complete waste of time,A bitter son with an obvious axe to grind has written a book filled with utter nonsense. One need only read the Epilogue to know where the author is coming from. I'm actually ashamed of myself for bothering to finish it.
2,Case kinda maybe perhaps solved but I doubt it.,"What led the author to pursue his father as the killer of Beth Short were two photos of her found in his father's possessions. Unfortunately, neither looks like Beth Short. That said, it was hard to get into this as a credible case. I will admit that it is hard to solve a murder over 50 years after it was committed, particularly when so many witnesses are dead. I think it remains unsolved. Worse yet, after reading about Beth Short, I think there are many more murders committed more recently of better people that should be solved rather than rehashng this one."
1,A LOT OF BUNK!,"A waste of anyone's time and money reading this bunk, if you are interested in getting facts. The same dreck that was handed out in the hardvover edition, which should have ranked a zero for credibility. For the make-believe conspiracy buffs and the stale popcorn lovers. An insult to anyone who has the least knowledge or even interest in forensic science. Straight bunk from begining to end."
1,Bait and Switch,"By now this book has been smacked down by everyone from the family of the murdered woman, to the LAPD, to every other expert on the case out there.Get this book if you want to read some ex-cop's bizarre yet tedious fantasy of having solved the Black Dahlia case -- yes, his daddy did it -- based on faked evidence, made up stories, and nonsensical speculation.Otherwise, skip it."
5,Truth Stranger than Fiction,"Just finished the new chapter. I had read the hardback last summer and came away thinking maybe George Hodel did it, but now, I am convinced. Too many witnesses and too many reports from the Los Angeles District Attorney's secret files all naming him as the suspect. The cops even have tape-recordings where the doctor admits killing the Black Dahlia, and his own secretary.The detectives in their police report, even having the doctor beating up a woman at his home, while they listen in from the police station. What was that about?What seemed incredible and impossible is true. Amazing story!"
4,Is this crime solved?,"After reading this book, as riveting as it was, I'm still not 100% convinced. The photos don't look anything like any of the photos I've seen of Eliz Short, even though a crime-scene photo I've seen elsewhere kind of resembles one of them. I think Steve makes a good case for his conclusions, and he seems to have been a master researcher. Also his detective instincts, which I happen to put alot of stock in, appear strong and credible. This is a must-read for true-crime aficionados, even though I'm not completely convinced."
1,NOT FOR SERIOUS TRUE CRIME READERS,"How can (very cold) crime cases be claimed to be ""solved"" when there is no real evidence linking the would-be ""suspect"" to even ONE of the MANY crimes this would-be writer claims HE has solved (by blaming his deceased father for all the famous L.A. unsolved murders!) This is a sham. Steve Hodel and the nonsense he is dishing up reminds me of a kid in a cheap Superman costume, running up and down the street yelling, ""Look at me! Look at me!"" Afraid this whole thing hasn't even made it to first base. And he's going to write another volumne of this muck? Give us a break."
1,Read All About It: Black Dahlia Murder Still Unsolved!,"Please, dear readers, learn from my mistake! This book was a complete and utter waste of time and money.Like many a Black Dahlia aficionado, my hopes were high when I cracked open the book and began to read. I thought to myself, ""just maybe this time there will be some sort of justice for the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short"". But, by the time I reached page 45, it became quite clear that justice would have to wait for another day, another year, another decade or another book. The closest thing we have right now is John Gilmore's 'Severed'.All is not lost, however, as I did learn a couple of interesting things from the book:1. Even a detective-writer can't always properly identify photographs of his subject. Of course, it is pretty unforgivable when your whole theory hinges on those photos!!!2. If Steve Hodel's father had anything to do with the murder of Elizabeth Short, this book certainly doesn't begin to prove it."
1,Telling change in the paperback version.,"It's pretty telling that the paperback version of this book (set for a June release) drops the subtitle ""The True Story"" and replaces it with ""A Genius for Murder."" Looks like even the publishers have caught on that this book is bunk."
1,The scariest part of this book....,...is that the author was a detective. This book is such a poor piece of investigation that I wonder how he was able to maintain his job. Imagine how many innocent people may be sitting in jail because of him.
4,Amazing Policework,"I found this book, logical and interesting with a plausable ending. Did daddy do it? Most likely........ can it be proved in court, no, no physical evidence and most witnesses are dead, however Hodel writes and goes through the motions that a cop would investigating a homicide and it's fascinating to see/read.Gave more information then alot of other books on the same murder, and was backed up with timelines and movements accounts of the suspects.Could daddy have been a serial killer, likely, but why would he have not continued in other countries he moved too? That was the main question I was left with.Great read, dry in spots, but fascinating."
1,Truly Disturbing,"I wanted to like this book but failed heartily as I read it. The author, a retired detective (the disturbing part, considering his flick-of-the-wrist, subjective attitude), finds two photos of an unidentified young woman. They don't look like Beth Short at all. No matter, his father was evil, he's a detective, and the woman in the photos has the same ""diamond-shaped"" face as Beth Short; all to be accepted by the reader as gospel, because, well, he was a detective. (Her face was round, it is not she in the pictures, and that's just for starters.)The author also accuses his father of perpetrating most of the unsolved mid-late 1940s Los Angeles murders within a thirty mile radius of Beth's dump site. I'm sorry, I have no ax to grind, but there is something very disconcerting underneath all of this. Moreover, the author is the most self-congratulatory I've ever encountered. Period. Many do praise the book, I merely disagree (sharply) with them."
3,a good story,"An avid reader, I like a good story. The Black Dahlia is a true story. This book isn't factual folks. There are many facts in it but it is not a ""true crime"" tale and the case is still unsolved today. I enjoyed the ""Diary of Jack the Ripper"" book also, even though it has come out strongly that it is not true. Enjoy the thrills and chills of a real who-done-it. Don't buy this book because it solves the crime, it doesn't."
2,Check out the eyebrows.,"Check out the eyebrows of the women in the pictures. They do not match Elizabeth Short's.....hers were unusually low and ran in a straight line, curving down at the ends."
3,Good Story but not convincing,"This is a well written story. It's very entertaining, however, there is no proof in the book that the murderer(s) is who the author says it is. There is circumstantial proof, but it is far reaching and doesn't closely link tje mentioned person with the crimes listed. I have since found out, after having read the book, that a lot of the things the author states as fact, have not been proven as such. The pictures in his fathers photo album that he claims are of Elizabeth Short, for example. Their is no definitive proof that the photos are of her, only the authors speculation because they are a likeness of her. While the author mentions that Stephen Kay backs his findings 100 percent, there are many in law enforcement today that do not back his findings due to the lack of proof. Good Book & Good Theory, but not conclusive."
2,Interesting but unconvincing,"The author convinces me that:(1) He had very serious problems relating to his father.(2) His father might possibly have killed the Black Dahlia.(3) He can't prove it, and is quite unscrupulous about confusing his own speculations with proven facts.The best evidence of guilt is the handwriting, and the fact that his father was a skilled surgeon, but it is far from enough to convict.It is much easier to believe that the author of this book is either deluded or deliberately lying, then that the vast cover-up and conspiracy he assumes, without any direct evidence, actually existed."
3,Makes you think twice,"I have read about everything on the ""Black Dahlia"" case there is to read (save the one by Larry Harnish) and next to John Gilmore's Severed this book is the most intriguing! Mr. Hodel doesn't have more than circumstancial evidence but what evidence!!! I think the guy's got something! If you don't want to believe his father is the murderer the book is still very good. Dr. Hodel was an awful man...but he travelled in some incredible social circles which gives more crediblity to the writer's theory. Childhood Shadows by Mary Pacios is also a must read for anyone interested in the murder of Elizabeth Short. In the 15 years I've been following this sensational case I am no closer to believing I know who did this terrible crime to such a beautiful and apparently sweet young woman...but this book along with the ones I've recommended gives the reader alot to think over"
4,Good,"Well written. However the story is a bit lacking in hardevidence, probably due to years of LAPD cover-up.I believe his story leading to the serial-killing committed byhis father."
1,Don't Bother,"I have to agree with an earlier reviewer. How Hodel could link his Father to the murder based on the two photos he shows is ridiculous. The whole book just doesn't work. His descriptions of his Father sound bizarre and his reaction to his Father even more so. If you want a good book about this case stick with something like Ellroy's ""The Black Dahlia"". It doesn't pretend to be anything but fiction."
1,HOT AIR,"I was expecting substance or true crime, but this is a lot of hot air. The book cover says, ""One of the most notorious murders of the 20th century...solved!"" It says, ""The true story."" There is nothing solved in this book. Nowhere does the author, Steve Hodel, make any attempt to show concrete proof that the Black Dahlia case is solved. He shows us pictures supposedly of her and says his whole case is based on these pictures, which aren't even pictures of the Black Dahlia! Nor is this a ""true story"" of anything except Hodel giving us his opinions; no facts, no ""true story"", just hot air. I have to say I feel cheated."
1,Coming up Short,"After wading through this intriguing--but ultimately totally unconvincing--quagmire of speculation, coincidence and gigantic logic leaps, one can only hope that former LAPD cop-turned-author George Hodel was a better detective than he is a true crime journalist. Upon discovering two snapshots of an unidentified woman in an old photo album that belonged to his father, he immediately jumps to the conclusion that not only is the gal the Black Dahlia (never mind that NEITHER of the pictures even remotely looks like any known pictures of the victim), but that his father murdered her as well. Then it's off to the races, with Hodel also nailing Dear Old Dad for more than a dozen other unsolved murders of the era, including that of ""prominent actress"" (Hodel's words) Jean Spangler (WHO???). Anyone with any familiarity with the case won't have any trouble finding holes in a lot of other similar ""evidence"" Hodel presents but why go on? Long story Short? Case still unsolved."
5,Black Dahlia Avenger,"A TEXTBOOK FOR POLICEWORKThis is a brilliant book. Black Dahlia Avenger is a ""how to"" on crime-solving and should be in every police academy and Criminal Justice College in the world. I am a life-long reader of both murder mysteries and true-crime and have never read anything that allowed me to so perfectly follow the step-by-step logic of the detective as he tracks the killer.While the madman that committed these horrible crimes may have thought he got away with ""the perfect crime,"" he did not. His evil deeds are now known and proven to the world. The forensic handwriting chapter, that proves he sent in the notes, is clear and concise, and we are presented with over eighty separate photographs that connect the many crimes.Once you start reading this book you won't put it down."
1,"""MENDACITY"" SECONDED","James Ellroy has written a forward to this regurgitated fantasy, telling the world he is convinced, and thus he firmly joins the ranks of the crackpots. This reprint continues to lack any official approval for the ridiculous claims in the first edition. Nothing but shameless exploitation, the same as the Janice Knowlton and Michael Newton book. I believe it is disgraceful that Ellroy supports this trash by endorsing it as the solution to his own mother's murder. There is nothing credible in what Steve Hodel has written, purported as fact, and I will never read another James Ellroy book. I am not interested in exploitive crackpots or their supporters."
2,Boring!,I am having quite a job getting through this. I have started and stopped several times.Hopefully I will finish it someday!
2,Disappointing,"The author's entire theory is premised on two photographs of Elizabeth Short that he found among his deceased father's belongings. If you believe that the photographs are Elizabeth, you may have no problem believing the remainder of the author's case. I do not believe that the photos are of Elizabeth. So, while the story is intriguing, this book has not convinced me that the murder has been solved.As far as this reader is concerned, John Gilmore's 'Severed' remains the book to beat."
4,Leave that vinyl on the shelf,"UltraHardcore fans will no doubt have many of these tracks on 12"" already, but here they all are on one CD.As a nice bonus touch, booklet shows the covers of the originals so you can see at a glance some of SSS's wonderful wacky 80s artwork. Add in some nice photos of the band throughout the ages (has it been that long?) and you have a perfect package at a fair price."
5,WORTH THE COST,Looked in local stores for similar forks and couldn't find one. I expected to spend atleast twice the cost of this one. It's just great for turning steaks and chops on my teflon grill. Very strudy and easy to clean.
4,Good Quality - if a bit pricey...,"I almost didn't purchase this item because it was more than I wanted to pay for this type of item, but I couldn't find anything I liked better, so I bought it. It is an extremely good quality fork, and will work wonderfully in my Calphalon cookware.I would recommend this to someone who wants a quality tool, but would like to see the price drop a few dollars."
1,Awful service,"I ordered a bird swing from this company in January and STILL have not received it. I wrote a review stating how unsatisfied I was and contacted the seller. The fellow I spoke to said that if I would delete the bad review he would send me the bird swing free of charge. He promised that he would follow up with me to make sure that I received it. That was last month and I haven't heard from anybody. I am very displeased with this company and their service. I suggest that you think twice....maybe more, before you order from Absolutely Pets. I had just a terrible experience with them."
4,Good length. Very predictable,"Easy to read in one sitting, which is unusual for chapter booksfor this age group.Story much too typically sitcom-like. Toopredictable. Young kids may find this enjoyable though.Some historical references give insight into life in the US 1940s. END"
5,AC Delco rotor,This brake rotor is the exact replacement of the OEM rotors that came on the car! Shipping was as discribed and I am very pleased.
1,A Waste of Reading Time,"It's hard to find a good Gothic novel these days. A friend loaned me Karen Koehler's novel, thinking I might like it. Wrong. Poorly-written is an understatement. There's a reason this book wasn't published by a real (that is, not POD or vanity) publisher - it isn't good enough. Koehler's prose reads like Anne Rice in high school and is, at best, more a caricature of the form than an actual Gothic novel. Save your money."
3,Interesting....,"It was alright. It wasn't my favorite read but overall I enjoyed it. I agree with most of the earlier comments. However, I don't think it's a memorable novel but if you enjoy reading historical novels particularly about the ancient world, then you will like this one."
1,Major Closet Homosexual,"After you listen to this guys act you may never want to have sex again. At least I just hope I never run into any of is former girlfriends. He won't date a woman unless she will perform ""analingus"" on him, and spends half hs act talking about this very thing. It seems he'd rather do that than have normal sex with a woman. And if this doesn't make you want to throw up maybe his story of how he gave oral sex to his best buddy in 2nd grade...multiple times under the front proch. Norton says he likes women but too mch of his act has a homosexual slant to it. The rest of his act is basically low-brow humor-- cussing in place of creative humor, like something a little kid would put together. I saw Norton on Leno and made the mistake of taking him as an intellectual comedian. What a mistake, Jim Norton's humor could only appeal to pure trailer trash."
5,Must Have,This is a must have...I love you Jimmy.....I was at the live taping of this exact show! Get this if you have any funny bone in your body (don't confuse a body with what Jimmy calls his). I will be also seeing his live show in Chicago at the Lakeshore April 25th. Take a look and see for yourself.
2,short life span,"These attractive shower curtain rings are unfortunately not very water resistant. After less than six months of use, mine are covered in rust spots."
5,Perfect product,This is a very nice product. These rings look like they will last forever. We are very satisfied.
4,A Must For Tobin Bell Fans,"Fans of Tobin Bell are strongly advised to purchase 'Serial Killer,' in which Bell plays a highly intelligent psychopath who stalks a special agent - with rather unexpected intentions.As a whole, the film is sub-par with regards to acting, but this does not apply to Bell, who steals scene after scene with his powerful presence and spot-on delivery. One may even argue that this is the best performance of his career, second only to that of John Kramer of the 'Saw' series.Although difficult to find (especially if you require DVD format), 'Serial Killer' is worth the search."
1,A let down,"If you want a good flick about the Crusades, get the director's cut of Kinddom of Heaven."
3,Crusaders Review,"This is a long movie, over 3 hrs. You would think that the title ""Crusaders"" would have lots of battles, not so. Most of movie deals with individual relationships. But the most annoying aspect is the subtitles. Box says English with Spanish subtitles, not so. It is English with English subtitles. Very annoying when actors are speaking and the english appears at the bottom of screen."
2,Crusaders,"First of all make sure you can handle 3 1/2 hours of movie watching because that is what you get. As to the historical accuracy of this movie it has it's moments but I can't say for sure on all of it. This would have been more entertaining if it was a little shorter with some of the ""trying to be real"" left out. All in all if you want to know something about the crusades this will give you a sense of it."
5,Great Tie Rack,"I read all the positive reviews before I bought this tie rack, and they may not have been effusive enough. First of all, it's a great tie rack. It's easy to organize the ties and move them around. The thing I really liked is that no matter what kind of closet set-up you have, you can install this -- and install it easily. The directions were so easy to follow, and there's not much assembly required. I'm really happy with this purchase."
5,Motorized Tie Rack,Quick delivery and great price. I have this hanging in my husband's closet and it works great.
1,Careful - Not for Wire Shelving,"Unfortunately, and contrary to the advertising, this unit does not mount properly to wire shelving. When the mounting is tightened the rack tilts upward at a severe angle. The hook and spacer system is similar to the previous Sharper Image models I have owned, but the top is curved and the spacers are not designed to compensate. Too bad, as the unit otherwise seems to be well designed. There's nothing particularly unusual about our shelving, and the (aging) Sharper Image autodrive unit I currently own mounts just fine.I cannot find any information on the internet regarding a fix for this design error."
4,Well design tie rack,"Best on the market. Motor silent. Moving conveyor belt is fast, light is sufficient to see ties even in a dark morning. The belt hangers make no sense as they are made to be hung inside of tie rack and so can't see if you have 72 ties or more."
5,GREAT,"GREAT PUMP!! No problems for me, of course at first it hurts a little, and you might get milk all over, but after just one or two times, it's really easy, I could pump out a 4oz in less than 5 minutes. I would say to the others that gave this product a bad review: maybe just a little more practice and reading the instruction manual a little better, and it would have been Great for you too. No need in spending lot's of money for an expensive pump when this one can do the job just the same, if not better!!"
1,Broke after a couple days of using it,The product broke after a couple days of using it. I dont recommend this pump to anyone.
2,Not worth it.,"Everytime I used this pump, I hardly got anything out. I used the Medela double electric and it is so worth the money compared to this."
3,Works well for the money,"This was a pretty good product. I am a stay at home mom, I pump for conveince. It was very loud, and the nipple cup was a little small. I also received one with a torn insulating compartment, but the extras were cool. I also appreciate the fact that there is an adapter to fit just about any container, so you can pump into all of your bottles or even in a bag and straight to the freezer. All in all it was excellent deal for the price. I would have gave one of the last stars back if I didn't receive it torn."
5,Great pump,"This is a great little pump. It comes with some great accessories, some starter milk bags and bottles it also comes with adapters if you chose not to use the First Years bottles. The instructions that come with the pump are easy to understand as are all the components, this is a great set for any mom. Although, I'm a stay at home mom this is great because of its portablity and the ease of use. A great price for a great product."
5,Great pump,"I really like this pump I specially the price. There is no pain caused by the pump. I am able to use any type of bottle including the drop in bottle bags. Not too loud or at least not loud enough to wake the baby. You are able to control the suction, and it is easy to assemble and clean. If you are planning on pumping only you should get a dual pump I pump one side while I nurse my child on the other so to me it this pump is great."
4,good value,Did a lot of looking at other reviews of other products and price comparisons and thought this was a good value for price and quality. Liked how the everything fits in the case just right and the extra pieces just in case and wish there was a little more room to store a couple of more items in it. The only think that that I am not happy with is the suction. With some stimulation the pump was limited on suction and some would overflow and dribble out from the cup. There was one other readers review that mentioned also about not having enought suction.
1,Broke very quickly,"This product was pretty loud, which is tolerable for the price, but it broke after only a few uses and bruised my breasts."
5,Good kitchen tool,I've been looking for a good spatula to use with my non-stick pans for a long time and I think I've found one. I had to pay more to get it...the cheap ones just don't last. They burn easily and begin to fray around the edges. This one is much tougher and it handles high temperatures quite well.
2,Great tea - way too much money,This tea used to be a little more expensive than WalMart or Sam's Club. Now it is outrageous. Will not order again. $8.43 increase per case in two months.
3,Great Tea ... Bags Suck!,"I really like this tea and have gone through 5 boxes. Unfortunately, they have problems with their tea bags. With boxes 1 and 2, each had about 4 tea bags that were unsealed, leaving loose tea in the pitcher and the bottom of the glasses. I overlooked that and had no problems with boxes 3, 4 and 5 (22 bags each).Today, I opened up box #6 and found an undamaged box full of loose tea, all the tea bags were unsealed. Understand, the paper wrapper around the bag was fine, it's the bags themselves that are NOT sealed. I can literally pour the tea out on the counter once removed from the paper wrapper. The box was completely useless.As I said before, I really like this tea ... I just hope Lipton gets their act together regarding their tea bags."
2,"Tea bags break, loose tea inside pitcher...","Great concept. However, problem is with the bags - are they using ""thinner"" paper? I tried ""ice tea"" bags first, that you brew briefly. I don't know if I am squeezing the bags too hard (when I remove from pitcher) but they broke, causing loose tea in pitcher. Tried ""cold brew"" - same thing! Bags appear fine in box; box was sealed in cellophane, undamaged. I would rather go back to the original tea bags and brew! At least they didn't break!"

3,a different Ginny Simms album,"Ginny Simms recorded this in 1960 after 10 years or so of not singing. Her voice is different than it was in her prime, the 40's. It's more husky and darker but maintains the sound of the big band era. The linear notes portray a honest but not completely positive outlook on Ginny. The original recording was done for TOPS, which was an inexpensive company. I've come across some of their stuff and this is the best thing I've heard from them."
5,Smooth REAL JAZZ!,"If you like real jazz and you like it smooth,this cd is fo you!I personally bought this cd when I heard one of the songs on one of san diegos jazz stations.I especially enjoyed some of the electric piano 70's style with flutes,guitar,everything!This is the kind of jazz you have when you are driving downtown manhatten or any big city light area! Cruising with your love or cruising remembering your love!Every song is hot untill last song. Some of you might love it, but I don't care for singing or any voice in my jazz unless its Fats Waller or Donald Fagen!This is a very nice piece of art!Thank you!John McLoughlin"
5,excellent easy listening music,We have enjoyed Mr. Adorney's music. It consists of several instruments and vocalists. Very easy to listen to.
5,took a while,I played this about 5 times in my car before I got to like itBut now I love it.Not as instantly moving as John's previous albums but still very beautifull music.The arrangements in this are great
1,GBA power grip advance battery recharger,Okay in all seriousness people who want's something on the original GBA being this bulky you would never be able to get this in any kind of carrying case because it make's the original GBA more thicker you would have to be out of your mind to buy this weather or not the year was 2003 or 2008 like right now I mean I saw this back then and said no way it's just too bulky. Do not buy this this is a waste of your money if you want a battery pack look around they made plent of other battery packs for the GBA that are so much more smaller than this and are way more cheaper than this.DO NOT BUY THIS!
5,The Best,I can't really add to what others have said. I bought one of these 12 years ago and use it daily. It barely has any scratches and I use it to scrape the pan after making an omelette. It's rigid through to the tip and feels good in the hand.
2,Edge started to chip off after three uses,"My last spatula lasted for a couple of years before the edges started to melt and the little pieces would chip off. This one took two days! After each use, I would have to peel off the melted parts. Rather disappointed in this product."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This game is fun but it has one big draw back, at least as far as my husband and I are concerned. We both play this game and have attempted to ""save"" our individual progress but found out the hard way, that the game only allows one profile per memory card! If you try to save a second profile on the same memory card, it will overwrite the previous save. I contacted EA games regarding this issue and they confirmed, only one profile per memory card. So if you too like to save multiple profiles ..."
5,Fabulous!,"There's a lot of new music happening out there right now, but this CD really bears listening to. It's fabulous, and not reminiscent at all of any band or any show I've been to lately. Hope you'll take the time to listen! They put on a great live show, as well, and I've seen them a couple of times at Studio 7 in Seattle. listen to the tracks listed there, especially the second one (can't remember what it's called). My favorite song on the CD is ""the FALL""."
1,Poor Mandy Spike,Poor fitWhat you see is not what you getQuality not goodVery disappointingWill not buy anything from the shoes manufacturer again
1,Totally Disappointing!,Although it looks elegant in the picture it looks cheap to me when it arrived. Another bad thing about it was it wasn't true to the size. I ordered for size 6 and when I tried it on it feels really awkward! I ordered this pair to wear it for my Singapore wedding supposedly and when I was browsing I really thought I found the perfect match for my bridal saree because it has the same shade of red. But I guess I would have to buy another pair and to be safe I'll try getting in the mall here in Singapore. Please don't buy this shoe I feel like it's not worth the price especially when I paid more for the shipping than the price of the shoe itself!
2,Just a collection of synopsys tools and usage,"I am not sure for whom this book is intended. It tries to cover all the Synopsys tool with very simple examples and some commands. It is probably useful to a student but not for an industry. Any internal company document about DC,PT etc will have much more information.This book lacks in depth and covers no topic in detail...not worth the money"
3,ok for an introduction to the tools,This book is interesting as an introduction to these tools but needs more depth
1,Looks nice...but thats where it ends.,"I have to be honest, I love the look of this thing. If only it perfomed as well. What's the problem with it? It SCRATCHES your media. That's right...after a couple of times inserting and removing the discs, they start to show obvious signs of SCRATCHING AND MARRING. But that's ok, because after all, you can call the company and they will do the right thing and replace those damaged discs, won't they? Wrong. Here is the laughable part:If they don't approve of the content on the media you are using in this product, they will ignore you. That's right, they for some strange reason, feel that the content on YOUR media that you purchased and was damaged in their product, is their business.If your discs happen to get mangled in this product like mine did, save yourself the time and effort, just return it. Don't put your faith in this company, because honestly, they just don't deserve it."
4,60 cd pod,"Always easy to deal with this company.Recieved items before expected and in perfect condition. Thank You, Dave"
1,waste of time,"Why is Amazon wasting our time listing an item they have no information about? Stop this practice, it makes you look like idiots."
5,An unexpected twist,"This is a good book, not just for teens but for adults as well. I bought it after I watch the tv series hoping it would give me more background stories on each characters, and indeed it did. I was expecting a lite chick lit of course and what do you know, it actually have an unexpected depth and makes one thinks. I love this book so much that I bought the sequel ""Sweet"""
1,very dissapointing,"although it has 'claimed' to be one of those forward thinking books on lesbian teenagers, it is a terrible, terrible book. i study teen lit. specialising in books about emerging female queerness, and i think of this as an example of one of the worst. it is poorly written, clearly voiced by a frustrated adult, who often lapses out of a teenage voice to that of a bitter adult, full of purple prose and attempts to be edgy and just comes off as seeming to be trying too hard."
3,A fairly good book...,"This was a refreshing look at teen sexuality in that the angsting over being attracted to a girl was kept to a minimum, and the focus was instead on the particular girl - Sugar, aka Maria Sweet, the beautiful party girl who befriends the narrator, Kim, when she transfers to a new school. The style is realistically teenagerish and although drugs and sex play a part, graphic details are kept to a minimum. However, it gets tiresome after a bit - especially with the use of various nicknames - and the ending comes out of the blue and makes little sense. Worth reading in the context of the lesbian YA fiction genre but hardly spectacular enough to recommend to a general audience."
2,A big let-down....,"I saw practically all of the series on E4 and thought it was absolutely fantastic, if a bit weird. Olivia Hallinan is a fantastic actress. Then I learned it was based on a book, so I got it out the library. I was amazed at how un-like the tv show it was.I was expecting a lot more to happen in it. The tv show is apparantly very loosely based on the book, and personally, I think that's a good thing, because the book was pretty crap.Kim has to move to a new school, and when she arrives, bumps into Maria Sweet a.k.a. Sugar, the leader of the girls in the school. They immediately become staunch friends, and Kim finds herself falling in love with her. There are a few lesbian antics in it, but hardly anything compared to the series. You can decide whether that's good or bad, I'll leave that up to you. But as for a storyline, I couldn't really find one.The book isn't all bad, there are some mildly amusing bits, but generally it disappoints."
1,poorly made,"The cord for this gun was not only very short, but the actual plug is too small for a standard outlet, it kept falling out, and it still had bits of black plastic on the prongs. Not only did it not plug into the outlet, when I tried to push on the trigger, it broke. Very cheaply made, not worth the price of shipping."
3,Symbolism in Need of an Image,"The book is 60% poetry and 40% notes by Yeats, so it is a mix of verse and prose. It may be better to start with the notes as Yeats explains the Irish mythology he draws on and the symbols he uses. In the poetry Yeats repeats certain images too much, so that it seems repetitive. These images, already established as symbols, (e.g. the rose, dreams, sleep, the wind, hair), become rather ineffective as they immediately prompt symbolic or abstract thought. I no sooner read the image then question what it means. Poetry engages the reader first by its literal meaning, there is vitality in original imagery, which is lacking here. The one poem in this collection that does engage is ""Aedh Tells of the Rose in His Heart,"" which I would rank as the best poem in the book. I also found ""Valley of the Black Pig"" interesting as Yeats writes of the mythological more than folklore, which is the subject and style of the other poems."
3,The Wind Among the Reeds,"I have never ordered or read this book. I have no idea what it's doing here. I wish I could stop writing reviews, especially reviews of books I don't own and have never seen."
2,Pretty but dumb,"I basically bought this camera for the looks alone - it's the prettiest digital camera on the market and is an exceptionally good knockoff of apple products. the touch screen is pretty nice too. however, i brought it home only to realize to my horror that it only takes non-rechargeable lithium batteries - this baby'll rack up the battery money in no time. it also doesn't even come with an AC adapter for indoor use (not that you'd want to be tied to an electrical outlet with a little camera like this one). if you can take the incredible non-practicality of it, you're getting a decent camera with great looks but very high maintenance costs."
4,Great Little Camera,Okay the person who wrote the 1st review does not know what he is talking about. This camera DOES take the Nimh rechargable batteries... and they last MUCH longer then the lithium ones. You CAN purchase a A/C adapter for it also. I guess he didn't even do any reading of the manual or research before leaving the review. The One and Only thing I have had trouble getting use to is the delay between the time you press the button and the time it takes the actual photo... but the quality of the pictures is worth it. The touch screen is very nice and the interchangable face plates is the final push that got my husband to purchase this for my birthday... he knows how much being able to personalize my stuff makes me happy! I am sure there are better cameras out there - but this one is just right for me and it could be for you...
3,"Worth the price, I guess, but not much more...","I bought this camera for my fiance as a pre-vacation ift, and was fairly disappointed. While its size and the fact that it uses SD cards and only 2 AA batteries, can be convenient, this camera ranks barely above that of ""nifty toy."" I own a 1.3 MP Casio Exilim and a 1.3 MP Sony Cybershot DSC-U10, all of which are comparable in size to this, but my Sony and Casio blows this camera away, despite its supposed ""2.0 Megapixel"" rating. Sure, the other two costed me more, but the fact that low-light pictures come out grainy and pixelized, even with the flash, renders the Toshiba almost worthless. Also, the strobe takes up to 7 seconds to charge after every pic! Talk about lost photo opportunities! I gave the camera a 3-star rating because of its size and the fact that it takes AA batteries, making it a decent on-the-go camera--as long as you use it in sunlight or another well-lit area."
1,Toshiba doesn't honor warranty,"We had this camera for just 90 days and it totally ceased workng. Toshiba said too bad, good luck, goodbye {money}. No more Toshiba products for us."
2,Lakc of Research and Development,"I bought the camera for it's size and web quality pictures. So, at first, it seemed be what I wanted, until the enclosed battery went dead. I was only getting 10 pictures for each set of batteries. The time delay in turning the camera on and the delay of picture taking just added to the lack of development this camera had. I missed too many shots."
2,How do you work this thing?,"I bought this thinking that it would go well with my calphalon wok... unfortunately, I have yet to understand how to use it!I""ve worked at a chinese restaurant and they don't even use tools like these so I'm guessing this is an American invention. They use a Wok Turner and a strainer all steel to let you know.Well, the designs are interesting and the construction is good so at least it has that going for it. ALSO NOTE: Don't even think about using this on a Steel Wok, leave it on the wok for more than a few seconds and you're utensil will turn to putty."
5,great crachit and tiny tim,"Well designed classic, commmunicates a positive active life, rather than pitiable poor cripple image. Good value, good seller. highly recommend"
2,Disapointed,"The product itself was fine but when I needed to send it back due to it being a duplicated gift, they charged me a 20% restocking fee. To me that price is rediculous and I'll not be doing business with them again."
5,Love it!,Perfect addition to my Dickens Christmas Town. I also ordered Cratchit's home and both items arrived quickly. I love it.
1,It is melting!!! I was misleading by the reviewers.,"Not recommended. Just used twice. The material melts. Very messy. Do not buy! The handle looks fine. When I first got it, I was excited. It works fine but the head melts."
2,Does not fit my camry.,This mirror does not fit exactly right on my 2000 camry. There is a quarter-inch gap between the top edge of the assembly and the door. I wish I had tried to see if it fit before painting it....
5,Hey! No fair!,"OK, who is this guy? I'M supposed to be the happening funny man; who needs Patrick Carlisle? However, I suppose I must admit, in the interests of objective journalism, that he does have a wicked sense of humor. Nothing like mine, of course, but come on! What really got me (and yes, he got me) was his take on Louis L'Amour, which you'll find in the tricky-prostate story, ""The Superior Man""; which story is warm, dashing and hilarious. You should really be reading MY books, but me, I'm reading Patrick's."
5,Bet you can't eat one!,"These cookies were served to me by a friend from the UK and I managed to eat 1/2 the box. They are delicious and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes the taste of butter and a cookie that melts in your mouth. No aftertaste in this cookie. It leaves you wanting for more. Perfect for a party, a tea, a dessert, or any occasion. Enjoy."
4,Gorgone,I really enjoyed listening to track 4 the most i really liked his melodic guitar playing on this song the most.
1,Where's my CD?,I bought this CD at the beginning of September... it still hasn't arrived. So far there's been no communication from this seller.
5,An Excellent score,The score for this movie is great. I believe this is one of the best orchestrations including bagpipes ever made. This is the second half of a great film. Without the music this would not have been nearly as memorable as it is.
5,Braveheart: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"The most beautiful and glorious CD ever made,EVER! The emotion of love and romance is easily conveyed and felt in this CD."
2,Do these people have the same soundtrack I do?,"I bought this soundtrack on the strength all the 5 star recomendations here. After eagerly opening the CD and listening to it, I can't believe we're hearing the same CD! Most of the tracks are bland, pretty much generic Hollywood stuff. Just the occasional traditional bagpipe or drum to remind you that this is the Braveheart soundtrack. Sure, I enjoyed the movie, but this CD is far too overrated!"
3,Another Kind Of Patriot Games,"James Horner might have scored big with ""Braveheart"", but I think that this music is one of the most repetetive ever. It certainly has beautiful and heroic themes throughout this CD, but cues such as 'Revenge', and 'The Battle Of Stirling' reminded me of some of the tracks from ""Patriot Games"": repetitive and tiresome. It's kind of difficult to find out what to expect from Horner."
1,Did William Wallace live in Ireland?,"I love the soundtrack to Braveheart - the stirring sound of the the Great Highland Bagpipes, the discerning use of traditional Scottish themes in the music, the authenticity of the instrumentation ... wait, that isn't the soundtrack to Braveheart! That's Irish pipes we're hearing - Uilleann pipes, they're called - and they are strongly characteristic of Irish traditional music, not Scottish.There's nothing in the music that evokes the highlands of Scotland -did James Horner ever travel to Scotland to feel what the highlands are like? Did he listen to one note of Scottish music to feel the history and spirit of the sound? I can't imagine that he did.What we get with this movie are the standard sweeping strings, the horns for the fight scenes, and the Irish sound of Uilleann pipes and the occasional flute to make sure we're thinking Irish not Scottish.This would have worked better for an Irish movie, not one set in Scotland."
5,One of the best soundtracks of all time!!!!,"James Horner has distinguished himself as one of the top music composer's in Hollywood with this one. It is a shame that it did now win an Oscar, but it did win the Grammy for best origial motion piture soundtrack.. as it was well deserved! This soundtrack has a very Celtic flavor, useing Irish Ulliean pipes(bagpipes) and an assorment of other Celtic wind instruments. The string and horn compositons are briliant, and very moving.. END"
5,loved the movie and love the soundtrack,"I love this soundtrack, I bought it years ago and lost it well in England. I bought a new one to replace. I love it, the music is amazing."
5,Good Service,I gave a good review because of the excellent service. The tape was faulty but they refunded my money without hesitation and therefore I gave a good review.
4,One of James Horner's more epic works,"What I love most about the film ""Braveheart"" is not only the battle scenes, but the music as well. I personally believe that this score is far grander than ""Titanic"" and ""Troy"". The musical themes are so varied and creative, that the score really shines here, though the themes do get a bit tiresome when it gets closer to the end. The Scottish bagpipes make it all the more memorable (""A Gift of a Thistle"" and ""Main Title"") and the brass and percussion for the battle sequences give more tension (""The Battle of Stirling"" and ""Falkirk""). ""The Secret Wedding"" and ""For the Love of a Princess"" have the perfect romantic feel. ""The Princess pleads for Wallace's Life"" is lyrical and sounds very otherworldly. ""End Credits"" isn't really special, but the rest of the soundtrack is. Horner has done a wonderful job with Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"".A-"
4,Mood Pleaser,I loved the movie Braveheart!!! Being of Scottish and Irish decent I naturally gravitate to the celtic and traditional music of this genre. This soundtrack is one of my favorites amung Riverdance(et la). When I need backround music to read by or just some music to lul me into a dream state I reach for this one. If you love the movie definaltey get the soundtrack and light a few candles and let it take you to the highlands.
5,James Horner is amazing,"It's funny how such a mediocre movie can have such a great musical score. Fortunately the music in Braveheart makes it bearable to watch.This soundtrack is simply amazing. If you're into movie scores, go and buy this right now; otherwise you will be missing out on some of the best movie music ever. I have always been more into action musical scores such as those of Hans Zimmer, and yet I still find this traditional soundtrack by Horner amazing and captivating. The main theme is repeated many times, but it never gets boring.Horner also has two other great scores: those of Titanic (I guess he's got a thing for making great music for stupid movies) and Glory. Of the three, however, Braveheart is my favorite (although my favorite movie of the three is Glory)."
5,WHOAH!!!!!,This music is beautiful. James Horner is a musical genius and proves it in this CD. Definetly worth buying!!!
5,Another Beautiful score!,"James Horner is, by far, the greatest soundtrack writer. His works are always moving. I had never watched the movie when I bought this soundtrack and still, the last track almost moved me to tears! It has many beautiful and quiet tracks along with the tracks that get you going. The great mix of bagpipes and other Scotish instuments make for an altogether wonderful soundtrack."
2,BRAVEHEART,Very dramatic music - felt like a battle. Not an easy listening type of music by any stretch of the imagination.
5,So romantic,"I just want to say that this soundtrack is, in my opninon, on of the best recordings I have ever listened to in my whole life, and I mean it. This music is so deep, so romantic, it takes me to another realm each time I listen to it. In fact, I can hear that music, I don't just listen to it. This is what I call Music. I can actually link some parts of my life to the different melodies of this epic score. It can almost make me cry sometimes. I'm only 18, but... this is Music, the Music of my life, pathetic, beautiful and honorable... I've never heard something that powerful before and I never will again, I'm sure of it... It goes that far..."
5,"Absolutely Gorgeous, Masterful work","Braveheart is quite simply the best soundtrack of all time. James Horner's incredible skill is mirrored most accurately in his stunning masterpiece that portrays in crystal perfection the great struggle for Scotland's independence. The heart-pounding battle sequences throw you in the midst of the brutal butchery; the elegantly flowing ""For the Love of a Princess"" describes vividly the passion, and the final three tracks make an excellent finale that made me fall deeper in love with this unsurpassed original score. It is not only music, it is the unpredictable struggles and the triumphant victories that are...life."
5,I LOVE BRAVEHEART SOUNDTRACK,"I LOVE THE MUSIC FROM BRAVEHEART THE SCOTTIST BAG PIPE ARE A NICE SOUND,I LOVE ALL THE TRACK(""I'M NOT KIDDING"")I LOVE ARE OF THEM,JAMES HORNER DID A GOOD JOB."
4,Emotional Soundtrack,"Everytime I listen to this CD, I am taken back into the film and remember the profound loss, deep hope and stirring battles. A beautiful CD. If you love the soundtracks to Last of the Mohicans, Glory, and Empire of the Sun - then you will love this as well."
5,It's great,"This score, just so beautiful and moving, depicts the flow and pace of the film right onto a cd. During the battle scenes, the score is the only thing heard. And it transforms the energy and anger and advneture and excitement into music. You can't help but replay the visuals of the movie as you sit and listen to this. And you can't help but get chills over and over again when you listen to the final scenes orchestration and it gets to the part when Wallace's sword is heaved across the battle field. It's magnificent."
3,"Old ""Skool' Kung Fu!!","I noticed many reviewers refer to this flick as Amazing, Great and the Best Ever. I'm not sure about that. It does have good fight scenes from the start to finish, an acceptable plot and the picture quality and choreograpy was good. But certainly not a 4 or 5 star performance!! Yeah I would recommend it, but don't go into it with your hopes too high, you could fall kinda hard!!"
3,"Could be better, but still very good.","If you like Jackie Chan, and Jet Li movies you'll want to see this. It is a preety good martial arts movie, could be better but if your a fan of this type of movie its well worth it."
2,"Campy, chop-socky film","Sammo Hung can best be described as a fat Jackie Chan. Hung and Chan have been friends since childhood (they grew up in the Peking Opera), and they routinely work together. Those expecting the pyrotechnic martial arts displays we've become familiar with over the past decade will be disappointed with this movie. This movie is very definitely a '70s martial arts flick, and the martial arts sequences are much slower than the sequences of modern martial arts sequences; these look more like 2-man katas than actual fights. The dubbing is bad and the make-up effects are awful.On the other hand, there is a certain amusement value to watching a fat guy (and I'm a fat guy too, so spare me your righteous indignation) leap about as agile as his skinnier counterparts. Indeed, it was precisely *because* I wanted to see an action hero built like me (as opposed to one built like Schwarzenegger or Van Damme or Willis) that I bought the movie in the first place."
3,Phat Dragon ain't no Jackie Chan,"If you like watching corriographed (sp?) Kung Foo movies, then you might enjoy this one. But its not belly laugh funny like other foreign Kung Foo Flicks such as: Super Cop and The Story of Ricky... but its okay. (Its one of those movies that you don't really care if you see how it ends or not)."
4,Advice From an Expert,"Sam Giest has parlayed his years of experience as a successful Toronto sporting goods entrepreneur with his wit and vision as a motivational speaker. The result is a textbook/workbook that provides checklists, helpful hints and throught-provoking questions for both the newly minted manager as well as the veteran.Geist liberally sprinkles quotes throughout the pages that help the reader focus on the topic at hand rather than being a distraction.The author wants the reader to take an introspective look at the qualities of leadership and ask themselves if they would truly want to work for someone like them.As he asks that key question in each chapter,Giest hopes that the manager/leader will undergo a metamorphasis that will make them more successful.This book should be a required reading in college management classes."
4,"Good, but not exactly the best :/.","Now I may be biased, but I can make the assumption that if you are buying this for a handheld (such as the gameboy or the game gear), then it might not be practical. For they don't seem to fit all that great in my Neo Geo Pocket Color. But then again, my NGPC did croak and that might have a factor in the fact why it might have not fit. It does, however, withstain a nice charge and is very convenient. The price is also not very ideal. I will not say the price, but if you are looking at this at the time of the review, you will know what I mean. They are very expensive and don't have that much practical use outside of the convenience factor. But I am still giving it 4 stars simply because it has not failed on me, and has been a time saver for it's use it got. I reccommend you get it if you are a traveler or just simply want the use of it as a convenience. I wouldn't buy more, but for what I got, I am satisfied."
5,USB Battery,I work in a small company and we have wireless mice for our laptops. We travel a lot and work in different locations. I found that this battery works very good for the mice and stops us from going through standard batteries every month or so.
1,Does Not Work with Apple Magic Mouse,Neat little concept but I bought these specifically for using in my Apple wireless mouse while I travel. Completely useless for this. The power light will not even come on. I tested the batteries in an electric shaver and they worked fine. No idea why they won't work in the mouse. I would return but it is not even worth the cost and effort of shipping them back.
2,I think mine are defective.,I had purchased some of these a few years back and they were great. They would hold a charge for a good amount of time and I loved that I could charge them from my usb port. I then purchased some more and the new ones I received hardly hold a charge for a week. I contacted the manufacturer and never heard anything back from them. Loved these when they worked now I am not going to waste my money on them any more since I cant get any customer service
4,Pay for themselves,I got these mainly for my xbox 360 controller and other things around the house. Ive had them for about a year and a half and they are still working very good. The battery life isn't as long as normal batteries but who can complain when you can recharge them time after time. They do take a while to charge completely but i usually just leave them charging when i go out somewhere and they should last me a week or more depending on how much i play. I reccomend these if you have something in your house (like a game controller) that you use regularly. If your just using them to put in a tv remote your probably better off just buying a pack of duracell.
3,"Nice, but slow charging","It's nice to be able to use any USB to charge, but takes forever to charge them up. Also can't get in AAA size due to size limitation of USB."
4,Work well,"Unfortunately, I got these batteries after I had already switched to a camera that uses a lithium battery. My old camera used 2 AA batteries, but I haven't had the opportunity to test if these batteries suffice.The rechargeable feature is extremely convenient, and works well with small items such as computer mouse and remote controls. At some point I may get out that old camera and see how they provide enough power."
4,works fine for me,"Charged fine on my toshiba laptop (dual core); my desktop (gigabyte mb, quad core); my backup desktop (gigabyte mb, dual core) and my junk pc (soyo dragon mb, single core).I use them to power wireless mice, but like the others, I build my own desktops..I was surprised at the cost to replace your motherboard, as I have never spent over 120 bucks for a new one, gigabyte, soyo, or msi.it's a cool techie thing which has some purpose. I'd buy more!"
2,I'm SO disappointed!!! :( Don't buy for your Digital Camera!!,"I purchased these batteries based on the reviews for my Digital Camera. 1. I thought it was a great selling feature that I could plug the batteries in while I'm on the computer. The drawback is that the computer must be on for the whole time the batteries are charging. I thought the USB port would be able to provide electricity while the computer is on like an electrical socket, boy was I wrong!! Plus it takes quite a while to re-charge.2. They don't hold the charge for long in my digital camera. I followed the instructions to the ""T"" (charged them for 5 hrs) when the light came off I popped them into my camera and was only able to take about 5 pics (while shutting of the camera in between shots)."
2,A step down from the original,"I bought this game because I played the Cheapass version of this with some friends of mine, and it was a personal favorite. They have done three things in creating this special edition version. The first being that they have detracted from the cheapass feel of the game by creating full-color, laminated cards to play with. The other thing they did was take a game that had a great concept and sense of humor, and add a number of cards to average the whole game's humor to a more juvenile level. The final thing they did was create cards that makes the game more mean. There are a number of new cards that you can place in front of a player that significantly handicap that player.I really appreciated the fact that the original game was funny and fun to play whether you were winning or not. This version, while still enjoyable, has now become much more competitive and less funny."
4,I love this game,"This game is hard to find and out of print but it's a lot of fun. There are two different modes, you can play a bunch of ""skirmishes"" which are fun little challenges (games) with up to four people and against the computer. There are about different 40 skirmishes so you won't really get bored and keeps it challenging.Beyond that, you can play the tournament which is like a video board game and you try to collect points. The better you do in the skirmishes the mroe points you get, and once the game board is completed, the player with the highest points wins. You play against 3 other players and/or the computer. Some of the skirmishes require teams of two, so they pair you up pretty much at random or based on the current points.My girlfriend loves this game and I enjoy it too. Her favorite is ""Brick Blaster""! too bad I beat her high score!! haha. great for hours of fun"
1,Not enough dragon,This game is very funned but the dragon from the movie is not in its very much. That maked me mad. She was me favorite karicter.SPOILERSThis game has no spoilers.
1,Copy Cat,"A clear [similarity] of the already crummy Mario Party series. Maybe it's entertaining for small children, but I doubt anyone else on the face of the earth would enjoy it."
3,there are two other editions of this worthwhile title,"alternative editions (enter or paste the 10 digits into the BookAdvanced-Search ISBN field, or into the Amazon.com Search box):ISBN: 0618619070 2006-02-10 trade paper (softcover edition)ISBN: 0618104690 2005-01-07 trade cloth (hardback edition)You can read Amazonian reviews and editorial reviews of these byvisiting the amazon.com online page(s) which give a free overviewof either book.BTW the same way Amazon has a SIP Statistically Improbable Phrasethe same way I have noticed THIS personally shocking factoid:""a time when roughly three-quarters of humanity lived in somesort of bondage, be it slavery, serfdom or indentured servitude"".FYI you can find a parallel situation WHICH STILL LIVES ON TODAY:fatimacrusader.com/crrosnov/toccrrosnov.asp Scroll DOWN to ""List"""
3,A volatile mix of science and politics,"The measure of a good thriller, for me, is its ability to keep me involved in the journey until we reach the destination. This novel certainly met that criterion.What intrigued me was the science, the descriptions of the environment,and the ever-present possibilities of physical, biological and chemical danger. In this novel, the challenges of sifting what is actual from what might be possible or probable is made more challenging by the remote location and, inevitably, the politics.Mr Jurjevics creates a rich environment in this novel and peoples it with some interesting if occasionally stereotypical characters.I recommend this novel to readers who like their thrillers action-packed and filled with possibilities. Ultimately, I was dissatisfied by the ending and that is reflected in my rating. Am I being fair? Well, I can only suggest that you read the novel and decide for yourself.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,"A good debut, but not great.","It is not without flaws. There was very little depth or appeal to the characters. The once I actually found most interesting was the Russian Admiral. There is a romantic relationship that starts almost as soon as the characters meet and, although I'm not a parent, I did have trouble believing the protagonist would have gone off to an inaccessible location for five months considering what was going on at home. But, there were also strengths. The sense of place and the environment in which the story was set was excellent. The suspense built nicely throughout the story although I also felt the ending was a bit of a let down. With a bit of Alistair McClain, in the descriptions of the Artic and the involvement of the Russian Navy, and a bit of Tess Gerritsen in the medical information and suspense, Juris has put together a quite good debut book."
3,"Good Thriller, Well Worth a Rainy Afternoon","Research: ACultural Context: BPlotting: A-BCharacterization: B-CNovelist Craft: A-BPiano-wire-tight, fast-paced thriller, reminiscent of Crichton's Andromeda Strain. Jurjevics shows great expertise in artic know-how, military gear and procedures, and epidemiology, enough to show he does his research right.Where he shines, though, is in the novelist craft. While I could fault him for the occasional extended exposition, he writes rather well, and builds believable characters that are distinct and believable. I actually didn't like his female protagonist, but I could picture knowing her.If I could have given him advice prior to publishing, I would have asked him to choose a better title and to give his stereotype jerk scientists (2 in all) more depth.Great plot twist at the end -- I'll dig out more of his books and read them.all rights reserved - Scott Jones"
5,International intrigue and scientific mystery at its finest,"A team of scientists at the Arctic Circle finds their members dying terrible deaths - and nobody knows why. Dr. Jessica Hanley is summoned to investigate, and as another naval mystery threatens, scientific investigation, disease and politics clash in a much wider fight for survival and control. The Trudeau Vector is international intrigue and scientific mystery at its finest."
5,Girls... Guns... Girls... Good Fun,"As movies of this type go, ""The Dallas Connection,"" is as good as it gets. There is a purity of motive that is commendable. As you might guess, the film features an array of amazing looking women. Wendy Hamilton, Sam Phillips, Julie Strain and especially Julie K. Smith would be perfectly at home in any Russ Meyer film. The story is more fun then the usual fare and there are traces of humor. For anyone who has taken the time to read the review, this movie delivers what want."
3,Rent it for the girls not the action or story,"Good things these girls are very sexy and gorgeous because the movie does not offer anything else, i still would buy this movie to feast my eyes on the 2 Julie (Strain, Smith)."
1,Retread.,"How many miles can Andy Sidaris get out of featuring the same basic plot lines and ensemble of women? I think he is about down to the nub. As opposed to ""Malibu Express"" and ""Return to Savage Beach,"" in this one all you get is token nudity and love scenes that flash by almost as an apology of sorts. If you're only into wiggle and tease, explosions and running here and running there, this might entertain."
4,good buy,"very happy with product it came as described and was here quickly, will definitely buy flags more next time i get a chance"
5,Spandage does the job,My skin is very sensitive to tape and I have an ongoing problem that requires twice daily bandaging. The spandage allows the dressing to stay in place without tape that pulls off my skin. It's a very convenient and useful product.
5,Lightfull Smoothies,I think this is a great product. I am prediabetic and trying to lose weight and find this is a perfect pick me up in the late afternoon. I prefer the Cafe Latte to the Chocolate Fudge. They both have good taste and I think I am getting much more for the calories and fiber.
1,Tastes Awful,Really unpleasantly surprised by the taste of this smoothie. It tastes like stale coffee with too much sugar and cream in it. I'm definitely going to stick with the chocolate. I'm afraid to try the other two..
4,LightFull Smoothie - Okay,I tried for the first time and it is not bad. The taste is acceptable and very convenient. The straw is attached to the unit in a celophane sleeve.
2,Slide out keyboard,This product does not slide very nice. For the price it should have flowed easily in and out. It slides rough.
5,Classic Material,"this is Classic Material here.So many Great Songs here.Earth,Wind&Fire,Luther,Stephanie Mills,The Isley Brothers,Bill Withers,Teena Marie,Harold Melvoin&The BLue Notes,Chaka Khan&Rufus,The Emotions,&Coutless other Gems.Very Soulful."
5,AMCO Rocks!,"Being an asian college student, buying amco products doesn't seem like a good investment. I mean, it's more expensive to than all the other nylon tools out there. However, my mind has changed and am now a loyal supporter of Amco.What makes this such a good product is the fact that only the ends are nylon. If you've used all nylon products before, you'll realize how hard it is to even lift up a piece of beef off your cookware. Nylon just bends too much when there's weight put on it. So to have a product that incorporates the toughness of steel and the non stick advantages of nylon, this is well worth putting your money on."
1,BEWARE! Not Nylon Coated,"The description states ""This long-handled spoon is nylon coated ..."" It is not. It is a metal handle stuck into a small, flimsy nylon spoon end."
4,great game but stick with the original,"sure this game looks pretty and the audio is great, it does get repetetive and sometimes its boring and confusing. but if you liked the original ecks vs sever game you'll want to add this to your collection, if you like shooters, find the original."
1,MagicGate is Anti-Consumer,Almost 500 bucks for this card and it tells me what kind of files I may and may not save to it? What kind of removable storage is that? I'm sorry but I'm not willing to take this kind of leap into control from the likes of Sony. I know there are hacks out there to reverse engineer the thing but I'd rather go with non-proprietary stuff that's cheaper and does what I want without the up-front fiddling.
5,The keys to a successful economy,"Despite the erroneous claims of several Keynesian progressives, the supply side theory was actually a very successful policy that resulted in an average growth rate of 3.2 percent per year. That being said, this book is actually the first major attempt at expressing exactly what Supply Side Economics is. This attempt at profiling the dreams of the Supply Siders is something to admire however, the policies that were advocated in this book were not necessarily the policies that were in effect. Knowing this fact, all readers should read this book as a ""treatise"" on Supply Side Economics and not a vindication of the Reagan economic policies."
4,Talk Now Albanian,"I really like this program. It works well. The only thing is that it dose have a worldly slant to it. For example: beer, wine, gambling like games, etc. So that is why I put it at 4 stars.Jesus is alive today, are you living like He is? God bless you!"
2,Misleading subtitle,"This book contains extracts from Nouwen's other books. I was disappointed because based on the subtitle I thought I'd be able to gain knowledge on how Nouwen sees spiritual direction. Ford, the Editor, did not attempt to elaborate on the extracts. The way I see it, this book is relevant to readers who want a glimpse of Nouwen's writings but do not want to spend time to go through his individual books."
2,Hard to Rate,"It's very hard to rate this product. The instructions are minimal. I bought it for dentures but, can't tell about it's process. I find the dentures somewhat cleaner but am concerned about the product itself. How frequently should the powder solution be changed? Does something need to be done to clean the product? What is the powder for (is it for jewelry, instruments, dentures or all of the above)? What are appropriate settings for various items? Would denture powder work in the machine? There are about two lines of directions and that's not enough"
1,Forget It.,35 Watts maybe just isn't enough power. I am very disappointed with the outcome after using it. It didn't clean anything much at all. I would let this one go!
4,so far so good,"i had been using it twice to clean all my jewelries such as rings, earrings, and a watch. it does not clean so well on small items, but once i pre wash it, and brush it then it cleans very well. Once it cleans, the items looks polish and new again. I will have give it 5 stars if i dont have to pre wash my rings and ear rings."
1,wild teal tree is a bah humbug!!!!,The tree was defective with the connector parts not matching up so the tree could not be assembled.I returned it and they said it was not defective and charged me shipping and a 20% restocking fee. So I ended up paying $ 60.00 plus for nothing but aggravation. Very poor quality for a tree they charge over $ 200.00 for also. . I was extremely disappointed and angry when I realized I could not even put the tree together because the male end and female ends were reversed. Do not be duped into purchasing this inferior product!!!! I feel I was scammed big time so beware!!!!!!
3,"Solid language program, but learning a language is not a solitary venture","I ordered this langauge program in anticipation of my trip to Nepal. It's a solid language program that uses the same format that was used when I learned French in Jr. High and High School.However, learning a language well, as this program intends for its students, is not a solitary venture. I realize now I should have ordered a cd/dvd program that would teach me the basics such as hello, goodbye, how are you, what's your name, my name is, where is, how much, etc., etc.If you have a group of friends to practice consonant & vowel sounds, verb tenses, and formatted dialogues, then this is a great program."
2,nepali language,I am disappointed in this book as it really more focuses on the reading of Nepali sanskrit. There are very few phrases to learn. This is a more in depth book than needed for a quick trip to Nepal..
2,confusing,Very difficult to learn much with this book. The structure is very confusing. It tries to teach you how to write but the explanations are very poor. I wrote a few words following the guidelines of the book and had somebody who is fluent in the language review and my words were badly written. It fails to make a smooth transition in teaching how to write and it is also very limited in teaching vocabulary.
1,Nothing new,"Nothing really new in here. Any health food store will tell you the suppliments that treat prostate and, of course, everone can benefit from eating healthy and exercise. Save your money and search The Internet for the same or more relevant information."
3,Kindle version is defective,Bookk is useful. kindle version is defective. Sections missing and misplaced. Sentences are cut off and then continue 4 pages later. Happens often
5,Highly recommended,"We met Dr. Katz at a book signing this week and were very impressed with his thorough knowledge and passion about the subject. The book is excellent. We have begun to make changes in our lives already according to his suggestions. Thank you, Dr. Katz!"
5,Or Another Tab In The Ocean?,"What do you get when you cross Jim Morrison with Hawkwind? Well, not this, exactly, but something close to it. Phantom's Divine Comedy, maybe."
4,Thick Guitars w/ Violin? I'd Be Stupid Not To Buy This!,"Very interesting CD, great thick heavy guitar sound with a violin (doing duel solos w/ guitar), sounds awesome together. Another reviewer compared them to Hawkwind which is accurate, mix that with a hint of Spinal Tap (sorry, Stonehenge keeps popping up in my head when I listen to this)and Cactus with a violin and Morrison(ish) vocals. Not too much singing on this. Well worth getting if you are a fan of Psychedelic-Heavy-Prog rock. You won't be disappointed. Fans of: The Melvins,Cactus,Fu Manchu,MC5,Stooges,Amboy Dukes,Humble Pie,Foghat,Faces (you get the picture) will love this CD. If you are not a big fan of 10 minute long jams, there are a few of them on here but they are more interesting than the usual jams (not as boring)."
3,Tim's Review,Great album. On this record they have a sound which reminds me of a cross between the doors and steppenwolf. Love Futilist's Lament most definitely my favorite track on the album.
1,SEA SHANTIES/HIGH TIDE,"This should not have been made.It is a collection of jams.Bad jams at that.There is no musical direction at all.They do not play like a band,meaning together.I DO NOT recommend this at all for anyone.Complete waste of money.AVOID AT ALL COST!"
2,DIDNT GET IT,WHAT PAUL J. ESCAMILLA SAYS IS TRUE HE WARNED ME BUT I DIDNT LISTEN I GUESS I QUIT DRUGS TO SOON I THINK I NEEDED ACID FOR THIS CD I WILL KEEP TRYING THOUGH SINCE I DID SPEND 23 BUCKS FOR IT THESE GUYS JAM BUT I DONT KNOW WHERE THERE GOING WITH IT AND I DIDNT CARE FOR THE SOUND OF THE CD BUT AS I SAID I WILL KEEP TRYING THANKS FOR READING.
3,Upon more thorough listening ...,"Since I wrote the ""Good Sonics, ..."" review I had the chance to listen to this CD more critically during a long trip. Though SOME sonics are indeed excellent, others are not. Some tracks (like ""Holy, Holy, Holy"") lack presence and depth, and some others are a bit muddy. Still a good buy."
2,Too Much Organ,"Although I love, and am very familiar with, many songs on this CD, I did not enjoy it as much as I expected. The title song is one of my most favorite. I am used to singing Acapella, therefore, I found the loud organ musical accompaniment distracting from the harmony of the masterful voices in the choirs."
5,Outstanding,Hymns played in the traditional way with full choir and organ accompany only. In the style I grew up with.
3,"Pleasant enough, but ...","I was hesitant to buy this CD because the title is really over-the-top, and now wish that I hadn't. The disc is OK, but I own other hymn collections I like much better. The performances are inconsistent, and several of the arrangements are downright schmaltzy. This is one of the few collections that contain one of my favorite hymns -- ""Fairest Lord Jesus"" and I also like the title hymn a lot, but don't think these two hymns are worth the price of the disc. I admit I'm a purist and I like hymns sung in a straightforward manner, with the occasional descant to add interest and texture. Sadly, this collections lived down to my expectations."
4,Enjoyable.,This item was given as a gift and the receiving individual has stated it was much appreciated and the music enjoyable.
2,"Great music, poor recording","I looked forward with great expectations to the day this recording would arrive from Amazon. The music did not disappoint me. It is glorious. But the CD has a serious scratch which switches tracks and a number of places where the volume is lost for severa seconds or longer. The longest of these are a few quiet hymns that can not be heard at a normal volume level. This is not a flaw in the CD but in the initial recording. The family living room can not accommodate the large changes in volume that might be good artistry in a cathedral.I would give the music on this CD five stars, but a CD is only as good as its recording."
4,Mini Toe Clips,"The previous reviewer listed as a ""CON"" that this bike is equipped with ""toe guards"". They are actually commonly referred to as ""mini-toe clips"" and perform a function similar to full toe clips and straps. #1 they help position your foot on the pedal, not too far forward and not too far rearward. #2 they help keep your foot from slipping off the pedal, especially to the front and #3 they allow you to pull up on the pedals slightly as you pedal adding power to your pedal stroke (this is where full clips and straps or clipless pedals are much better).Far from useless, for some riders mini's are all that is needed."
3,where is my bike,"Dear Sir,I would like to know where my bike is. I bought 2 bikesone for me and one for my husband we would like to startbiking together and there is still no word on my bike meanwhile not only dont I have the bike but I am pying intrestedon my credit card. I use this service alot. we live 850 milesfrom my grandkids. you have gotten many an order from meand I love my grandchildren. pls fix this problem so I canstay a happy customerSincerlyMargaret Clason"
4,illustrations are captivating,"As other reviewers have noted, the text of the fables is written in a contemporary style, but with oddly dated slang. The collection also omits some favorite fables (i.e., the tortoise and the hare is illustrated but not retold, Androcles and the Lion is not included at all...). However, the illustrations really draw young readers into the tales. I would have purchased this book for the illustrations alone. Enjoy!"
2,Not very custom fit,Was disappointed in the fact that these were 1 and 1/2 of a set not a full set of seat covers. The velcro did not work well and the bottom portion would not stay on the drivers seat. Not at all satisfied...but for the money thought it would be a good deal. Get what you pay for.
1,"A Bit TOO ""Budget Buy"" For Sousa","I have become quite the Sousa fan in the past year. While my ear for classical music is that of a casual fanboy and not a seasoned classical music critic, I have become particular in my Sousa preferences, and this particular release left me cold. The pace of the marches on this CD are sluggish, and sounds tinny even to a listener with a tin ear.John Philip Sousa marches are just too good and lively to settle for a budget release like this. A good release like those by ""The President's Own"" U.S. Marine Band series is a better place to start your Sousa collection!"
4,It's been said before.,"As others here have said, this CD is definitely ""mixed."" The Sousa marches are great. LOUD and played by a band---as they should be. The adaptation of the Military Academy marches is downright---well---Painful. Mixing these Military Academy marches with the Worst of 1950/60s schaltz(sp)is too much. So why 5 stars? The Sousa marches! Tulsa Joe"
5,Best collection of marches!,"In spite of the mixed reviews below, after listening to the samples, I had to send for this CD. I am so glad I did - this is the best collection of marches I have ever owned. It's worth noting that the Band of the Grenadier Guards is a British military band whose history goes back 300 years!"
3,Not what I expected,"It is just a cheap sweatshirt I could have bought at Walmart for less. I also paid shipping as I thought it would be a better quality than regular made in China sweatshirts. It's OK, I 'll wear to walk."
4,GOOD QUALITY SWEATSHIRT,THIS IS A GOOD QUALITY SWEATSHIRT FOR THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT. IT IS MORE IN LINE WITH A MEDIUM WEIGHT SWEAT SHIRT.
4,Seatshirt quality,It fit well but I felt it was a little on the thin side so I don't know how long it will last.
5,great,"It is comfortable & attractive. Its warm enough to keep me comfortavle, yet not bluky under a coat , which it what I wanted.."
2,Not exactly a slicing knife.,"I purchaced this knife but it was not what I thought it would be. It says ""serrated"" but it is not exactly the same as a serrated knife. What this blade is is a ""wwww"" shaped blade on the bottom, it looks the same from both sides. It is designed for pushing vertically through veggies, creating the ""wwww"" edges, not for slicing. It is a quality knife, well made as are all the Heckles 4-star knives, but it is a specialty chopping tool rather than a slicing knife. I gave it the low rating simply because it was not what I thought it would be when I ordered it, but if you are looking for a garninshing knife and this is what you have in mind, then this fine tool."
2,Still-Born Novels,"Each story, written in the first person, takes a character from puberty through maturity - often right up to death - with the help of a narrow variety of spiritual insights that seem to come from the back covers of self-help books. The author calls these works stories, but they are really a series of under-developed plot outlines for novels, which are marred by the voices of the narrators, who all sound like the same person reincarnated. The ""Gaspara Stampa"" piece led me to buy this collection, and it is perhaps the best of the lot, but this is a compelling story to begin with, and not much was added to the facts of her life. One is much better off reading the poems of Stampa and Rilke themselves."
5,Lost Love,I am delighted to have the chance to read this book. It is how we find love in life and in a moment of heat we lose them never to find them in most cases. It provides how we beceome so occupied with ourselves that we forget the substance of love which is about sharing. So it is a great book!!1
4,Boxing Fans Will Love This Game!,"If you are a fan of boxing, you will like this game. The roster of fighters is impressive, no Tyson or Jones Jr., but including guys like Hopkins, Vargas, and Mayweather Jr. is a nice feature. Defense is important, and you need to move your fighter around to be successful. Each fighter has a ""specialty"" combo, Sugar Ray's windmill and Duran's devastating body combo. The game will become a little repetitive in career mode. But all in all, it's a fun game, and the ""dream"" matchups like Marciano vs. Lewis, De La Hoya vs. Leonard make it worth your while."
3,"this game is ok, but go with fight night","KO kings is a pretty good game but it has its downsides. the meplay is pretty fun, its very addictive and it never seems to get old. but the features suck. the backgroun music is the worst ive herd in a lond time, and the graphics could use some improvement. it is unrealistic to real boxing, and its too easy. after just one or two rounds you win, it doesnt take thaT long to beat. the soun is alright i guess. also, the create your own boxer sucks! you can only customize a few things, you cant really decide what he looks like.overall, its pretty fun at first, but it has its downsides. if you want a real good boxing game, go with fight night. i guarentee youll like it better."
3,Too easy,I kept waiting for the book to become exciting but it remained ho hum. It seems to me that Mr. Brooks may be tired of the Shannarra characters himself because this reads like a story you tell when you're tired of talking. No real struggle happens in or out of the Forbidding. Major characters with large parts in earlier books are eliminated easily. Its almost like a summary where only the most salient points are being made but all the substance has been left out. Call this one Shannarra Cliff Notes.
3,Great story!! but not his best.,"I have read every book by Terry Brooks and have enjoyed everyone of them. Some more than others however ""The High Druid of Shannara"" trilogy was read and not savored. It was a fun voyage to ride along with Pen, Cinnaminson, Kyber and Grianne, to name a few of the charcters, and I would recomend it to others but the ending was too quick there was no meat no excitement no rise and fall just done. The jaw dropping, heart hammering, can't put it down were not there but as Terry Brooks always does you are left satisfied with the money and time spent. I would go back to the Landover series and start with ""Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold"". I would have to say Terry's best work was ""Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold"". I called in sick so I could finish this book. I can't wait until the movie comes out in the next few years."
3,Straken: High Druid of Shannara,Not the best of the series. I thought it got a little dry and predictable in parts/
2,didn't need to be a trilogy,"Eh...best way I can describe it. If you would have cut the fat out of the whole trilogy it really could have been just two books instead of three. When Terry is at his best in Straken you can't put the book down but when he is at his worst I found myself skimming over the paragraphs. I think this series suffered from lack of interesting characters who were two dimensional at best. The villains seemed to be dumb and dumber and the heroes, when in a bind, always found that item they needed to get out of the bind. I found the most interesting characters coming from the forbidding. Overall if you read the first two then you need to read this one and get some closure. It wasn't a clever story but kept me entertained enough to finish the book. I was disappointed with the whole series after enjoying the Voyage series so much I expected more."
3,Satisfying,"As a conclusion to the High Druid trilogy, Straken is a satisfying read. It is as enjoyable as the previous, and with an ending that I actually liked. Not as good as classic Brooks at his best, but still good."
4,Not his best but still a good read,As a true fan of Terry Brooks I eagerly awaited the conclusion of the High Druid series with Straken. Although overall I found the book quite enjoyable I thought the pace was too quick and there was not a lot of back drop that you usually find in his books. I found myself wanting more explanation of events and more concentration on the charcters. For once I think that he may have outdone himself this time with such great characters. I found myself thinking of almost all of them as lead ones and wanted more depth in their story lines. Overall I would recommend this book to any fantasy fan but Terry Brooks fans may be a little disapointed.
4,Great book... ended quickly... but with unexpected twists,"I have read and loved all the Shannara books (even the short story in the Legend II collection). Mr. Brooks' latest work is no different. True to the rest of the series and written in the same style Mr. Brooks wraps up and concludes the triligy nicely.I will say that it seemed to end quickly, but maybe that was because I wanted it to go on more. There were some unexpected twists toward the end, that I must admit I didn't see coming.A great story. If you liked the previous Shannara books, or a fan of Tolkien you will like Straken (but make sure to read at least the first two books of this triligy first, if not the rest of the Shannara series)."
3,My Two Cents,"Having matured as a reader since the 70s when I first read the first Shannara book, I can honestly say that Brooks' is not all that talented as a writer. His descriptions and use of language is not as polished or on par with the newer authors. Also, he really isn't a creative mind since he just recycles the same themes. However, they are fun books and I have read them all since the first one when I was just a kid. So, don't expect much new or worderful use of language and you'll enjoy it for what it is - A light adventure..."
2,Just Doesn't Live Up,"I recommend to Shanara fans that you wait for the cheaper paperback copy-you already know what is going to happen anyway.I have been a Shanara fan for years (and years and years...) but the High Druid series has really made my turn away. Brooks has gone Dan Brown on his fans, leaving his books well written, but disparingly predictable. There are no more 4:00am finishings- you can put this down until tomorrow with no problem (or the next day, or next week...). I think Brooks need to take some time and stop writing for the contract, and start writing for the story again."
2,"Message to Terry Brooks...""Take your time, no need to rush.""","I'm beginning to appreciate the multiple years that passed between books in the original Shannara trilogy. Both trilogies, The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara and The High Druid of Shannara, felt really rushed. As for Straken, Brooks introduces a lot of characters and sets the stage for a lot of confrontations that just don't take place. Then the main confrontation, that has been building up for over two years and in three books, just fizzles out. To put it another way, it's like working hard for two weeks and then getting shortchanged on payday."
4,A must for die-hard Shannara fans. Others.......?,"This book was published in the UK by Simon & Schuster in August. As a longstanding Shannara/Terry Brooks fan I found it enjoyable but in some aspects disappointing. Even in a 'Fantasy' book some of the things that happened were unconvincing. Included in this was the, in my view, unsatisfactory ending. However the main character, Pen, was likeable and believable - and the ending was a happy one for him."
1,Can't believe it ends this crappy.,"The first Shannara series took me months to finish, it was that boring. Then Brooks's writing picked up speed, and so did my reading. The last two series (Jerle Shannara and the High Druid series) I finished in ten days (also due to a flu).Although the Jerle Shannara series ended a little bit on the strange side (with a sort of a cliff hanger that turned out not to be one (or is this called an open end? If it was, it was a very poorly executed one, like an afterthought), this conclusion of the High Druid series is a big, big disappointment. It felt as though Mr. Brooks didn't feel like writing it.He left all kinds of story-telling chances unexplored, the most dangerous characters simply vanished into the background and the main villain was laid off in a jiffy and a half. And o what it could have been! I would almost emplore Mr. Brooks to go back to his computer and do this one over. It can't end this poorly!"
4,good story,"I enjoyed this story, but some of the pages were hard to read due to printing errors: fingerprint smudges, faint print across the page, ink blotches. If I were to do it again, I'd fork out the money for the hardcover."
5,Beauty and Grace,"There was a day once when I was really depressed and happened to be shopping at one of those stores that have earphones for sampling music. I started listening to this cd and something magical happened. I didn't understand the words, but I understood the language. The music made me feel like there were things in life that are beautiful and worth living for. If my heart didn't have that hard stoic shell I would have started crying right there in the store.I have listened to the music from this soundtrack many times since and the feelings that it brings out are still the same, beauty, grace, love and passion. There is a very lovely selection of songs here and I highly recommend this cd."
1,"Broken pot, same as above!",The same thing happened to me as with the buyer above. Received the bulb and the planter was shattered into pieces.. very poor shipping. There is no phone # to call and get help with this and I have sent a email as to what I am supposed to do but talking to a live person would be much more helpful. Big waste of money.
5,Sunscreen,Skin doctor recommended it. I can't find it in my area so I order it online. It seems to be working.
4,"Works as advertised, but some caveats","I picked this up for use with my recently purchased Sony digital camera, and it works great. Unfortunately almost all Sony products manufactured before 2003 cannot use these new high-capacity Memory Sticks.Another sticking point is that only 460MB is usable on this stick, losing a whopping 52MB to the file system and Magic Gate overhead. I also own a 256MB version, and that has 220MB free.Write speeds are noticeably faster compared to the older Memory Stick media, as well as read speeds in my USB 2.0 reader. Luckily the price has come down on these, and if your hardware can support it, these new Memory Sticks are worth picking up."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This won't work in pre-2003 Sony devices, as Sony made a design mistake on original memory stick (and kept its consumers in dark). Neither would existing card readers work.These sticks contain MagicGate protection. This means that you won't get even 488 MegaBytes of actual space from this 512 MillionBytes stick. MagicGate uses up significant space (40MB) and create all kinds of hassles in transfers of things like mp3's.But wait that's not all, these sticks are kinda obsolete already. These won't work in any SonyEricsson cell phones or smaller Sony devices like Stick Walkman & newer U series Cybershot cameras.If you want to invest in sticks buy a MS Duo Pro stick, the latest of half a dozen stick formats from Sony. (Soon most cell phones will have a slot for removable flash media) Or you can say no to all Sony devices and buy SD/MMC based gadgets to avoid all these hassles."
2,Memory Sticks Are Ill Conceived,"There are too many incompatibilities in the Memory Stick format. Sony obviously failed to properly plan and design the memory stick. After waiting over 2 years for them to brake the 128MB barrier (which they had promised) the new cards were incompatible with the old cameras. On some cards you can transfer MP3 music, on others you can't (some sort of Memory Stick police I guess). Some memory sizes will work on some equipment, but not others. Lots of other idiosynchrasies - like Duo, two 128MB in one, and other incompatibilities too confusing to keep track of. Sony should forget the Memory stick which it badly mangled and instead stick to compact flash and SD cards where compatibility is not as much of an issue."
1,What is Sony thinking? Another Betamax?,"Are you kidding me? I don't understand how Memory Stick Pro is not compatible with my current Sony products? The new cards are finally offering me the capacity I need but I can't use them without upgrading product!! Can you spell F-R-U-S-T-R-A-T-I-N-G!! Talk about getting left in the lurch. I have been a loyal Sony product buyer for years, but am thinking about making a switch. I did some research and it seems there are a lot more choices out there that support the same - if not more and better products - and the media capacity is just as good and works with all products available. I checked out a new Panasonic camera and a Palm that supports SD - I'm making the switch.Don't think Memory Stick Pro format won't last if they keep this up."
5,Absolutely Worth The Cost,"This knife now does the majority of my prep work. Good cutlery lasts a lifetime and enhances the cooking experience more than any other essential. This 4-Star hones to razor sharp and holds the edge. Good heft, good feel. Comfortable and effortless to use. You could pay more, but I would question why."
5,Cuts everything like butter,"I have 3 chef knives - one Cutco, one Wusthof, and this one. I like this one the best by far. It seems to stay the sharpest. The grip is also quite comfortable."
5,perfect,"I love this knife. It is extremely sharp, holds a great edge, durable, good balance, and I only paid $74.99 for it when it was on sale! What more could you ask for from a knife?"
5,"First time ""good knife"" buyer..and Im impressed.","Bought this just to try out the style and brand of knife to compare it to usual store bought, ""comes in a big set"" knifes. First impression, very impressed. Solid built, cuts everything like it was melted butter. I will definately keep this brand on my wish list."
4,Solid Blade,Great knife for all-around use. Nice size tang. Nice blade. Good as a primary or secondary knife
2,Expected better from morse,"I've had very good experience with morse products in the past, but this blade really missed the mark. There was extreme vibration in the blade regardless of how slow or fast I lowered the saw. This resulted in not only a rough cut but very short blade life. Short story.... not worth the money."
2,Not happy with quality of blade. Will not be buying a 2nd time.,"Blade cut slow out of the box, and didn't last very long. Dewalt blade lasted about 5x longer, and cost a little less. I will not buy again."
3,TOYSMITH METAL RAKE,"WE BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR 2 YEAR OLD GRANDSON AT THE REQUEST OF HIS MOTHER. HOWEVER, I CAUTION ANYONE ABOUT THIS METAL TOY WHICH REQUIRES ADULT SUPERVISION FOR A YOUNG CHILD. FOR PRETEND PLAY, A PLASTIC RAKE WOULD BE BETTER FOR A LITTLE CHILD."
4,This was for my wife,"Its hard to get between hedges, so wife wanted this size instead of regular rake. Not able to try out yet,until Spring."
1,very disappointed,"wow--what a piece of junk. The metal tangs bend as soon as they hit the ground. The kids feel they are doing something by holding the rake, but if they actually try to rake with it, watch out! I promise they will be no help to you in raking all those leaves!"
3,"""Was"" it worth the Trip?","Wldly orginal, creative but at times depressing novel about the inspiration for L. Frank Baum to write the Wizard of Oz. We also see the fictionalized perspectives of individuals connected and affected by the now classic film. We are introduced to the real Dorthoy Gael an orphaned girl who is molested by her Uncle Henry. ""Gee Toto, I really don't think we're in Kansas anymore."" The parts dealing with Judy Garland flew for me, the pioneer Gael parts along with a man suffering from AIDS demetia dragged."
3,Hampered by Realism,"I would really, really have enjoyed this novel if it weren't SO real, and if Jonathan were less annoying. He's too whiny, too inactive, for me to care very much about him, and almost everything having to do with him slowed my reading of the novel. Dorothy's part, and also Bill's (however brief), were captivating, and I also enjoyed the Judy Garland stuff. It's just that a bit more than a third of the novel is devoted to someone I didn't like. Otherwise, I'd recommend it."
2,.,I bet I would have loved this story but I couldn't take the writing style; too boring. [close] I bet I would have loved this story but I couldn't take the writing style; too boring.
2,Waiting... Waiting,"I kept waiting for this book to get good... It would seem to head that way, then drift off into the boringness it came from. Finally, at 2-3rds of the way in, it got good. What I'd waited for: can't-put-down-good.Not bad enough for one star (after all, I did keep reading), but not enough payoff to recommend."
3,Bleak,"This book was fascinating; I did not want to put it down. The author has a wonderful writing style. He ties together a number of disparate but connected storylines seamlessly. However, I found all these stories to be almost relentlessly bleak. This book left me depressed. If only this talented writer would turn his talent to writing something with a little more hope!If you want to read an intelligent, well-written novel, based on the story of Oz (from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West) that is also great fun, I would highly recommend _Wicked_ by Gregory MaGuire."
4,The Best U.S. DVD's,"Listen these aren't as good or deluxe as the U.K. HK Legends versions, but how could anyone say the previous American versions of these are better? I mean ""Way Of The Dragon"" has almost ten min of great comedic scenes restored. The interviews are interesting, and while I would of liked to see the Euro scenes of ""G.O.D. 1"" on here, it is still the best set yet. Would I buy the HK Legends editions if they came out here, yes. Will this set entertain me in the meantime, yes. I also must defend including both G.O.D. films. They are part of the campy fun of the era and I actually like the plots. Sure they could have been better, but they shouldn't be forgoten."
4,A hit for my husband's birthday,My husband is a big Bruce Lee fan. I bought this collection for his birthday and he loves it. It has all his favorite movies. The DVDs are of great quality.
2,I hate to say this...,"but ""Enter the Dragon"" is Bruce Lee's only good movie. He's an incredible talent but these films are like tests of endurance especially with bad dubbing. Buy ""Enter the Dragon."" Skip this collection."
4,All 4 One - Four stars to the Dragon,"This is a great package, I like it a lot, no that much for 5 stars but it's very good."
4,Bruce Lee is da man,"I'VE ACTUALLY ONLY WATCHED ONE OF THE MOVIES ON THIS SET, ""FISTS OF FURY"". MAN, I REALLY HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT LOW-BUDGET B-MOVIES THESE WERE, NOTHING LIKE ""ENTER THE DRAGON"". BAD STORY LINE, NOT GOOD FILMING, VERY GORY AND BRUTAL. IT'S JUST FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S JUST AWE INSPIRING TO SEE BRUCE LEE, THE NUANCES OF HIS ACTING, THE WAY HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD KICK EVERYBODY'S BUTT ALL THE TIME, BUT HE JUST HOLDS BACK UNTIL THE END. HIS MARTIAL ARTS ABILITY IS TREMENDOUS, VERY PUNCH FULL OF PASSION, YET PRECISE; AND THE WAY HE TRANSMITS FEAR INTO HIS OPPONENTS BY LICKING HIS BLOOD OR TIGHTENING HIS FISTS. WHAT A STAR HE WAS."
2,"REALLY, dont buy for the last 2..","Its a good selection.3 movies you dont see in the USA movie genre..The last 2 are comedic.1. Bruce died and it was filmed from the END, so bruce is there, and the BEGINNING LAST, and bruce is DUBBED IN..2. In the last video..its a collage of CRAP. Bruce wasnt involved and was long DEAD.tHIS IS PROBABLY AN ADDON to finish a collection, and has a few EXTRAS that show what the movie WAS and EDITED for, in the specials.."
4,***WIDESCREEN*** Best bang for the buck Bruce Lee collection around,"The remastered picture has never looked better! Best of all, it's in widescreen!The 5.1 English track sounds great however I personally love the 2.0 Original Cantonese soundtrack. I would've given it 5 stars if the Cantonese track was remastered also. There's nothing like hearing the true lines. If you turn on the subtitles you'll notice that the dubbed version is quite different from the original script. For $11 you can't go wrong with this collection."
4,"No ""Enter the Dragon"", good otherwise and Great Price","You cant really call this the ULITMATE COLLECTION and leave out his highest selling film ""Enter the Dragon"", Im sure its because Warner owns that title.But for $15 you get all his major films and the cheap joke films Games of Death I and II that were made from stock footage.Good quality and sound, agian, for $15, you cant go wrong, just go and buy ""Enter of thre Dragon"" and the 2000 Documentary ""A Warriors Journey"" and you're good to go."
4,Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection,Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (The Big Boss / Fist of Fury / Way of the Dragon / Game of Death / Game of Death II)Excellent product with very clear video and dts 5.1 sound. Though the sound in some scenes are not very clear but subtitles supplements it.
2,Poor sound quality.,Ok video quality. Sound quality is quite poor. Sounds like the voice overs are speaking in a tin can. Too bad. Great collection of movies with horrible sound quality.
4,Bruce lee ultimate collection,This is by far the best video and audio treatment outside being completely restored theses movies have ever seen the only thing missing is more extras but for this low price it is a great deal.
5,"What I got for $13 was ok for me, this price is too high","This is a must have for all the Bruce Lee fans out there. I am not sure what the new collection set is all about as I purchased this collection for $13.00 last year. I don't think I would paid the new price of almost a $100 for this set I don't love Bruce Lee that much to pay that kind of money.However, overall this is a fine collection of all of Bruce Lee's greatest hits. I am happy with the box set that I have and would recommend buying it, but not at a $100."
3,No Enter The Dragon...Not An Ultimate Collection,how can this be called an ultimate collection without enter the dragon? for the price it's a good pickup if you don't already own these movies. i would have liked enter the dragon included. game of death and game of death 2 could have been left out.
1,don't buy this set,POOR picture quality. POOR sound quality. Better when I watched them on commercial cable TV.
4,Fist of Fury = Chinese Connection,It appears that The Chinese Connection is included under the title Fist of Fury (the UK title). The Big Boss is another title for Fists of Fury (plural).
4,A Christmas gift for my husband,"I bought this DVD collection for my husband who has a serious man crush on Bruce Lee since he was a young boy. The DVD's are great quality and include scenes he had never seen before. If you are a Bruce Lee fan this DVD collection does not disappoint. Even if you are not a fan but like action films, this collection is not a bad investment!"
1,What a ripoff,I do not know who wrote these reviews but after viewing this collection I was compelled to write this review. I am a fan of Bruce lee and his movies and to have someone come out with this low quality imitation of remastered videos is a disgrace to his legacy. The sounds were almost comical. The real insult is to put special features on each video and to see that there are none. I clicked on the special features on every video and there were no specials. I wish I could not give it one star but I have to in order to write this. Be very careful if you get this collection and know you get what you pay for.G
4,Still Important Today,A book with a keen perspective about an important time. Schlossstein provides unique insight into the human condition as it was played out between Japan and the U.S. Highly recommended.
3,When the Japanese cast a taller shadow,"It is too bad this book is out of print. I read it years ago, and it still makes an impression in my mind like a bell going ding-dong-ding. Back in 1983, the Japanese were giants, seemingly invulnerable, and threatening America daily. This book is how America still had one advantage, creativity, and how the Japanese countered by sending industrial spies to Silicon Valley. The scenes of infiltrating a SV company, then getting the chip back to America on a tramp steamer, are memorable. The scenes in Japan itself, showing the Japanese corporate hierarchy as still bound to samurai tradition, are even more so. Kensi means one's samurai teacher, the kind you greet with a mean sharp sword in your holster and bow to. For Americans who still don't understand the Japanese, this book filled a need. Too bad it's out of print."
4,Bought product as a gift,I bought this product for my sister. She is a nurse and requested this specific book. I'm assuming it met the needs of her job. The price was definitely right for me.
3,Pretty OK book,I'm a nursing student so I got this to help my ID of abnormal strips. It's ok but not too in depth. Might be good for someone newly diagnosed with heart problems who wants to be able to read ECG's.
1,Disappointing,"I got this book and was immediately disappointed by it. I was expecting more hand-felted toy instructions and there were few to none. The toys in the book are mostly from flat felt sheets like you'd buy at the craft store, not from actual wool that you actually felt. I returned it immediately."
4,"Great Lp,but there's something different at end!","This CD,mastered from the Original 1967 Lp,at its end has two things that are noticibly different..First,the Crowd ""Roars"" that were so proudly displayed,are gone,and,two,the tune selections are also mostly different..As an owner of the original Lp,I can tell these right off by listening..Other than those two Small,but noticible Diffrences,everything else is the same! It still is a moving Soundtrack of the old John Ringling North-run Circus,before Irving Feld took over in '68..I Believe This was recorded in the Old Madison Sq. Garden,before it moved to its present location in '67 (This was possibly recorded in 1966.)..A great Recording!"
2,Same ending over and over and over and over again,"""Akin to Anne"" is really boring, Yes,some stories are intresting,but most end in the same monotonous way:""Oh,your last name is ----!I had a half-sister/stepsister/sister who went out west and we never wrote to her because she married poorly!Her husband/middle name/grandmother's name was - (whatever the person's name)!"" You may try to deny it,but it's true!"
3,Enjoyable stories for those who love Anne books,"Reading this book, you will meet many orphans who are sweet and dreamy but haven't been loved. But you are assured of happy endings in these short stories just as in other Montgomery's works. If you have already read many of them, you'll find the same character traits, plots and dramatic events several times in this book, but her stories are enchanting even with similar plots. And I'm sure you'll feel happy and optimistic after reading those stories. Like myself you may feel happy to imagine how those characters and plots have been woven into Anne series."
1,"Read one, you've read them all","My title says it all. I kept on reading them and hoping just ONE of them would be different, but no, it was just the same. Due to rather unlikely cicumstances an orphan finds long-lost relations and lives happily ever after. If these stories were dispersed throughout other collections this would not show up so much, but the editor has actually shown up their worst fault by grouping them all together like this. Each story in itself is OK, but they're just like slightly altered photocopies of the same story. As an avid Montgomery fan I was disappointed. If you want her short stories try 'The Road to Yesterday' instead."
2,Ultimately...disappointment,"L.M. Montgomery was a remarkably astute writer, when writing her short stories she would frequently tailor them to the specific needs/desires of her audience (for these stories, younger children)or editors. It shows. This collection, while full of lively and courageous children, is just too insipid and cloyingly sweet to really be enjoyed. The stories are so chock-full of morals, like ""pills in a spoonful of jam"", that the reader nearly chokes on them. You get the feeling even Montgomery was bored when she wrote them.There are many excellent collections of Montgomery's stories available; do yourself a favor and skip this one."
3,crock cracked,Worked fine for 2 years. Is the crock supposed to crack from use after 2 years? Won't buy this brand again for this reason. Normal use.
4,Top of The Line Slow Cooker,"The Cuisinart CSC-400 4-Quart Slow Cooker is the best one I have tried. It does what it is designed for, and has controls and status lights that make it easy to use. I bought it for cooking pinto beans according to a recipe that require about 20 hours of slow cooking for full nutritional benefits. I like it very much, and plan to continue using it routinely.There are two problems with very good looking cooker. (1) It lacks adequate insulation, and gets so hot at the bottom that I had to put an insulating pad on the counter beneath it. The rest of cooker gets very hot, and needs insulation on the sides. (2) The cover is very nice but does not fit snugly because of a slightly irregular surface on the crock."
4,Pleased as far as it goes.,"Nice piece of equipment. I think I would have preferred an oval cooker. I had to chop a pork tendloin into small pieces to fit it in the cooker. It cooked it fine for home eating, but not much of a presentation for company. No problems so far. Be sure to remove all the skin and fat from a chicken before cooking. Gets really greasy otherwise."
2,Too Many Negatives for Cuisinard,"People, look at these Cuis. products. Everyone is complaining that they are too hot, cooking has to be adjusted, afraid to leave it unattended, have to check it every hour, etc., etc. --- then you give it a 4 or 5 star???I finally got the Hamilton Beach stainless with triple bowl sizes (2,4,6qt). Go see it-- everyone loves them and guess what? They are REAL slow cookers. I think Cuis. has a design flaw in their line and should recall them-- both digital and manual contol owners complain about them.What, you like the looks too much to admit they are bad products??? Get real and trash them."
4,Good Soap Mold,"I'm reviewing this product strictly for use as a soap mold. I think the price is reasonable and the silicone mold is fairly sturdy. The problem is that it's not quite sturdy enough for adding four pounds of liquid melt and pour soap base. Due to the heaviness of the soap, the silicone mold bulges out on the sides, allowing for an even wider soap loaf.While the above didn't really bother me, some soapmakers might benefit from knowing this. Also, since it was used for melt and pour glycerin soap, it might not work like this for rebatched soap; I haven't tried that method yet.Removal of hardened soap is effortless and the silicone mold is easy to clean. Another huge plus is the fact that it's so lightweight."
3,Gave as a gift.,I had this sent across the country for a wedding gift. I never got a thank you or an acknowledgement that they even received it although it was something they requested so don't know what it was like.
3,"decent loaf pan, but too thin/wobbly","I've made a few loafs of bread and a couple of pound cakes in this pan, and it has generally worked pretty well. My one compliant about this pan is that the walls are too thin, making it very wobbly and hard to handle when full of wet doughs. You can also tell which things were cooked in this pan due to the fact that they come out with bowed sides (from where the pan bulged out due to the weight of the dough during cooking.)"
4,Good Knife,I bought this knife for my husband who likes to cook. He loves it. Sharp knife with a nice handle.
2,Warps,"Have had this for quite a while, it warped in my broiler. I have an older gas stove with the broiler underneath, the heat is very close to anything that is being broiled. For $12 bucks, what else did I expect?"
2,Save Your Money,"I must confess, I've had this pan for a couple of years now, however, I don't cook anything directly on it anymore and haven't for months. I hate it. Shortly after using it, the coating came off of the boiler pan. Now it really needs a good scrubbing every time you use it as ANY liquid that sits on it for too long causes small rust like spots. I tried to go cheaper on this purchase, believing in the Duncan Hines brand name, but should have bought a better quality. The size and weight of it is great, perfect for a 2 person household."
1,piece of feces,"this is false advertising. I bought this pan to broil meats with. It is advertised as non stick. The first time I broiled steak, the cheap pan started warping. when i tried to clean the pan, i could not because the oils from my steak caked on. after scrubbing for 10-20 minutes, the non stick came off. i threw it away."
1,worst golf ever,"I have played every golf game on the market, and I would just like you to know that this is simply put the worst game that has been my misfortune of purchasing. I strongly beleave that the creaters of this game have never played golf or seen a video golf game in thier lives. It has made me strongly rethink my purchase of your game cube, because if this is going to be the quality of your games then I'm not sure that I want anything to do with them. This game has been a total waste of money and I will tell everyone I know not to buy it."
4,Great fun in the tub,"My toddler loves to play with these in the bathtub. They bubble and fizz when they dissolve, and she thinks it's the best thing ever. It looks like it would stain your skin, but it doesn't. You do have to use a bunch to get the tub to be vibrant, but she has fun dissolving them anyway, so that isn't too much of an issue."
3,Terrible customer support,"I admit, my kids love these drops. They don't leave a stain in our tub and provide nice colored water. Recently I purchased two containers for Christmas. After opening one I discovered 1/3 of the tablets missing (no blue). I assume there was a problem during production. After multiple calls and multiple voice mails left to the customer support number listed on the product they have yet to call me back. I won't buy them again which is a shame as they are a good ""Made In The USA"" product."
3,Read the label!,So this is a great fun thing for kids HOWEVER if you read the label it states that kids have to take a bath after bathing in this. It also states that it can stain the grout. Really? I'll just stick to using food coloring in shaving cream!
2,Fun...for a while....,"The product produces an ""ah""...for a few seconds, but it has no sustaining excitement for a toddler. I wouldn't rate it as educational... however, it is a cheap thrill."
5,Crayola Color Bath Dropz - 30 Count,good product. my 5 years old son love to take color bath and now he can learn how to receive color from another two colors
5,Love these,"We just love these! Our kids enjoy it, too. We have had no issues with any staining, either. As a matter of fact, we are almost out."
5,a fun way to take a bath,"My 3 year old loves to take baths as it is. Adding some color to it really blows him away. He can't wait to try new colors every day.The tabs themselves do not harm to the bath or your child so no issues with that. Great purchase overall, glad I found them on here."
5,surprising intensity,"I only use one drop and I still get intense colors. My son tries to grab the water as it changes colors. They have stained nothing on or near the tub, which is important to the parents of splashers. I just wish my parents bought me stuff like this, but my bath water was always clear. There isn't too much to say, it either works or it doesn't, and these do. When I run out (we use them for ""special"" baths) I plan to buy more."
4,bath dropz,when i recieved the product i knew that i had the chance of getting inconsistent colors based on the reviews. the tablets are not the colors stated on the jar but they do dissolve that way and you can make the combined colors. (the red was a little more like pink though) but red(pink) and yellow still made orange. good product overall.
2,This just did not hit the right note,"I should have listened to the other reviewers of this product. Don't buy it if you are a real Kuchipudi dancer, or have ever been one. The singer has a wobbly voice that cannot stay on the right note, the dancer is lacking in energy and expression, and the whole production has a second-rate feel to it that is very disappointing after you have watched many of the more polished Bharatha Natyam CDs. Having said that, I'll admit that this production is a good idea."
5,Not just for bread!,"I've had this knife for over ten years and have never had it sharpened. It still works great. I chose the bread knife over the smaller serrated utility knife and use it not only for bread, but also for tomatoes and other delicate things that need slicing."
5,Love this knife!,"Hubs thought I was crazy for buying an $80 knife, but I seriously don't care. I've always struggled with larger handled knives since my hands are so small, and I'm an avid bread baker so am always cutting bread. I use an electric knife when cutting even slices of loaves, but I wanted a bread knife for those two or three slices . . .this thing is awesome. Sharp, nice handle that my hands can easily grip, and it's beautiful. Perfect!"
2,Not So Great,"This knife works fine for loaf pan type breads, it does not work well for loaves any wider than that, however. The actual usable length of the knife is more like 6.5-7"" (the guy that said it is 8"" long, probably lies about the lenght of other things too. LOL) It is too short to use for normal round loaf breads. The blade is also a lot stiffer than what I prefer in a bread knife, but this may just be a personal preference."
2,Alaskan Pioneers,It was a little boring but it was ok. It is not one that I would tell others to watch.
1,Boring,"I can't believe I wasted ten bucks on this stupid thing. I really wish I could get my money back. If you're interested in Alaska, watch Yukon Men or something similar, this documentary sucked"
2,Just Ok,The movie does show real life people living in the wilderness of Alaska. But it doesn't really show how they live off of the grid in a detailed way. They also talk about dog sledding too much.
2,Disappointing - too many topics and no enough depth,The first part of the show focuses on the Iditarod and the second part on 3 groups of individuals living off the land in the bush. Each section did not get enough time and barely scratched the surface. The Iditarod segment would logically stand as a show on its own. The second half of the show provided only the most cursory view into the lives of the individuals.
2,Informative but poorly edited,"Thought this looked interesting when reading the review, but the movie only had a good section or two and it ended abruptly IMO. I would rather have spent my money on an episode of one of the series from Discovery Channel about Alaska."
3,Not what I thought it would be,A look into the rough life they lead but not very interesting - l am glad I watched it but looking back I would not pay the money again.
3,"too much polish, not enough content","Not terrible, not great either. Lots of polish, but very little content. The first half of the movie is pretty much about two dog sledding families (who work together), so the first half seems overly long. There are much better examples of Alaska homesteading, so you should probably just see those (again if you already saw them)."
2,Not Recommended,"This is an ""amateur"" documentary and I use this word because of the poor editing and general lack of focus and clarity from a topical point of view. Some parts of the interviews are redundant (the same thing is said 3 times in 10 minutes) and other parts are simply pointless. Again, the fault of poor editing. That said, there is some great footage of Alaskan scenery but that doesn't make up for the rest of the video."
1,"Beautiful scenery, horrible film","The reviewers who gave this film 5 stars were clearly not watching the film I watched. I grew up in Alaska which means I'm no expert but every time they cut to an outdoor scene regardless of the season you can hear a raven. I thought it was odd hearing it during the winter so much. I listened a bit closer and they are using a loopback of the same call. Depending on the length of the scene, a pattern of 5 then 2 calls with a small bit of some small songbird. Nothing but the finest in fake frontier authenticity."
2,I should have read the damned reviews!!! Dooh!,"This is the second freaking movie I bought on Amazon about ""wilderness"" or people living ""off the grid"" and once again they have a generator, build their house with electric drills,saws, they have snow mobiles,... I thought it was gonna be about how they build a log home with a axe and a knife??? Then if that wasn't enough, like others have stated, most of the movie concentrates on the dogs, feeding them, and sledding? NO mention of how these people ""SURVIVE OFF THE LAND"" which should be the freaking point of the movie!! Off the grid survival, you know, have a garden, how do they plant tomatoes, what vegetables do you plant? when?,what grows best?? do you have sheep or something,... jeez. Nothing like that here, just mostly talking about the dogs, and how they bought the land, moved from the city, and how awesome their dogs are... crap man, I want my money back. I haven't learned a thing from this.."
1,Not Worth the Money,Awful for the money. Maybe if it was a multipart series. I can't believe how short and shallow the whole thing is. I could have spent no money and had a better show to watch. Make sure to avoid this lame documentary.
1,Off the grid? Maybe. Out of the matrix? Not a chance...,"It makes little sense to me to import things like drywall and 2x4's to the remote Alaskan wilderness and call it living off the grid. Deep cycle batteries, an inverter, a sump pump, just so you can take a shower? Oh Brother! Rube Goldberg anyone? Still relying on the crutch of industrial infrastructure when claiming to want to get away from just that. And what's up with keeping like 60 dogs on a 6 foot lead all day and night except when they're pulling sleds and atv's? Seems cruel to me. If my neighbor did that, I'd call animal care and control. If you want to see a documentary film about living off the grid in Alaska, Check out Alone in the Wilderness. That dude definitely did not need a generator to scratch his ass...."
2,Could have been better,"This show was too much about the dog race and not enough information about living off grid in Alaska. The story line could have been more indepth about the people who choose to live off grid. I personally know people who live this way in various places in the U.S. and there is a lot of hard work that goes into everyday life. That is the truly interesting stuff, the day to day details that are worth watching."
1,Not what I expected !,"Well, I am truly disappointed. It was almost all about mushing dogs in Alaska. I wanted it to be about everyday trials and experiences on survival. The good and bad of it all. I enjoy learning how and what are the best ways of doing this for ones self. But, this wasn't anything close to it. There was one man in particular in the movie that showed how he does things on a daily basis, but, didn't show from beginning to end on how he started it all.So, I do not encourage anyone in buying this movie. I, thank goodness, rented it for one time and glad I did just rent it because basically it was pretty boring. But, does have gorgeous scenery."
5,Watrford Lismore - inch Vase from Amazon.com,Beautiful vase. Amazon was great to work with and shipped my items in a timely manner.
5,Pavarotti & Friends,"This was ordered for a friend. She is enjoying it more every day. At first there were just a few selections she liked but as she listens many more are growing on her.Thanks, Amazon, for the fast delivery."

4,Girls sliding shorts for softball,"Sliding shorts seem to work well for my daughter. She's almost 9, but on the small side. Shorts fit her nicely around the waist, but seem a bit loose around the leg. Not sure it will stay down when she slides or not. Most girls that are average size for this age they'd be fine for though. She loves them."
3,Good quality BUT...,The photo on line is hot pink but the shorts are a light pink and my daughter was very disapointedshorts are nice but
2,Rust Spots! And For THIS Price?,"I'm sorry, I hate to say this but I'm VERY disappointed with the quality of this knife. We wash and dry it immediately but it still gets rusty. It cuts very well - I'll give it that, but the rust leaves a bad taste in my mouth!Not a good quality knife."
2,Favorite but with Reservation,"It's now time to replace this ""most used knife in the kitchen"". We bought it 4 years ago, but now most of the serrated area is worn away. This value level of knife should last longer than that. Like most serrated knives, sharpening the Henkels with a grinder is not recommended, this really diminishes the value. Honing (sharpening) with a butcher's steel does keep the blade somewhat sharp--but not like a good sharpening on a stone would do. Since they don't last very long it may be wiser to purchase lower priced knives and replace them more often--that's what I'm looking for now. BTW most internet sites use honing and sharpening interchangeably (see Wikipedia and Consumer Reports). The material and tool actually make the difference. I have solely used a butcher's steel on the Henkels serrated utility knife (and delicately at that)."
3,Pretty good - not great sound quality,"Sorry to disagree with the other review but the sonics on this CD are not the best. For a better CD try ""On the Road""."
2,A CHALLENGE TO COMPLETE!!,"Only my commitment to finishing a book when I start it enabled me to complete this fantasy novel passing itself off as suspense. Despite the 300+ page length, I never felt as though I ""knew"" the characters in the story. And although I find paranormal psychology and the like fascinating, the book was just ridiculous. It was so overwhelmed with this type of detail that the story seemed lost somewhere in the midst of it all. Certainly, the killer was a surprise, but with better character development a reader could better appreciate the shock.Will I read another Kay Hooper novel? Possibly, since I am a fan of the genre. But I won't be reading one anytime soon.DYB"
5,thrilling! chilling! reading.,"I have been reading this series since kay hooper started it and all i have to say is if you haven't read it than please run directly to your nearest bookstore and start with the first one until you get to a sense of evil. it is so captivating that i just read it in one setting, and i don't mean it took me a whole day. battling evil, finding love and not wanting to accept whats right there in front of you well this is it. i can promise you you want be sorry. i think you need to read the other three books before you start a sense of evil so you can understand how they have gotten to were they are now.. enjoy."
2,Worst Read Ever,"Oh my gosh! I could not wait for this book to come out and when it did, I bought the hard cover - waste of money.The other ""evil"" books were great, so why wasn't this one. It was one of the worst books I have ever read, and am a reader addict. I bought all the ""evil"", ""shadows"" and even some of her earlier works, but this, WOW, don't quite know how to describe how disappointing this book was. Also it's a good thing I like Kay Hooper other works or I wouldn't buy another of her books."
5,Kay Hooper does it again!,"Never one to disappoint me, this Kay Hooper book starring Bishop and his special crimes unit (SCU) had be up all night reading it through. A page turner from the beginning I was able to get into the book and loved mention of recurring characters. The the best thing about these books is that you can pick up any of the stand books and read it as a stand alone...or read it as part of the series as I do. These books are quick read but good. There is plenty of action and enough characters to keep you guessing throughout. I can't wait for the next book."
1,Who wrote this book???,"Who in the world wrote this book!!?? It certainly couldn't have been Kay Hooper. She does such a fantastic job on her plots and stories that there is no putting the book down once you get started. This book, however, was a real struggle to get through. I buy too many books to waste money on a hard back that should have been either a paperback or sent to the trash. The characters had no emoton, and as far as I could tell, there was not much of a relationship building between the main characters except the electric spark that happened when they touched. There was a whole lot of psychic babble that could have been left out.If this is your first Kay Hooper book,please don't give up on her. She has many, many other books that are fantastic."
2,An unexpected disappointment,"I have been a Kay Hooper fan for over fifteen years and I really looked forward to this book. Unfortunately it was not up to her usual standards. The plotline, characterizations, and romance were all sidelined by repeated explanations of the whys and hows of psychic policework. The relationship between the couple and even the suspense of hunting the murderer never seems to develop. Read any of her other books, but I'ld give this one a pass."
3,What an end!,"The paranormal story in this book will keep you reading and thrilling you. At some parts of the book KH will try to do something that couldn't be possible, but she never did. So at least everything in this book could be ""real"". I won't tell you what is because I will tell you the spooky story. The problem with this book is the end of it. I think that KH didn't know how to end it and she asked one of her offspring to do it. This end is among the poorest ends I've ever read."
1,Delusional moron fodder,"Books like this are clearly designed for distracted or stupid people. Every character is as depthless as an acronym, and the ""psychic"" dimensions are juvenile. If I want true escapism from reality, I cannot be reminded constantly how hokey and brain-dead the entire thing is. If the Communists burned books like this one, I might join the party."
2,Subpar,"Being a Kay Hooper fan, I naturally ran out and bought the book the first day it came out in hardcover. Well, I won't be doing that again. Too many characters were running around in this story to even keep track of who they were, let alone to wonder what purpose they served. This book also had many pages of explanations about the wonderful world of psychics that didn't (in my opinion)serve the plot. And there were many unexplained references to past books, including a character from the first book in the ""Evil"" Triology, that were confusing even to me as a reader of her previous novels. And the ending extremely disappointed me, to say the least. Overall, I'd advise one to skip this novel and check out her ""Shadows"" Trilogy."
3,Better than the other two books in the trilogy,"I was looking for a new author and decided to try Kay Hooper. I bought her Evil Trilogy and have just finished the last book in that series, Sense of Evil. I apparently totally misunderstood the trilogy concept. I assumed all three books would have significant crossover of people, places and things. This was not the case and there was no benefit to the reader to have read other books in the trilogy. The common theme in the series was using paranormal abilities in law enforcement to solve crimes. The paranormal angle was too overused for my taste in the first two books. Hooper took it down a few notches to a tolerable level in Sense of Evil. Perhaps I should have done a little more research before selecting the Evil Triology...maybe Hooper's other books don't include psychic FBI agents...but, unfortunately, I'll never know since I just am not willing to give Hooper another chance."

3,why oh why did she rush through the ending,"Up until the ending everthing was great! This book had everything I loved in a romance novel a cat and mouse chase, humor and suspense. But the ending ruined it for me. Not only did she rush the ending she totally forgot about sarah's bossy brother and her beautiful best friend they too had a little cat and mouse thingy going on. But she just ended the book. I guess we were supposed to use our imaginations. Why... did she do it? Oh the humanity!"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this book, because I enjoyed ""A Belated Bride"" so much. Unfortunately, this book has too much frustration and anger, and not enough humour to make it an enjoyable read."
2,...What happened?,"This was my first Karen Hawkins book. I liked it in the beginning. Then it went not so good when I started reading about Sara. I liked her wit, but sometimes the things she did were not logical, or not right, or appropriate even. There was a good amount of tension in the story and I liked the relationship between Sara and Nick. But when I found out she wasn't a virgin, it kind of turned the whole thing off. Their first intimate scene was too quick, and it felt as if it weren't their first time together, rather, more like their first time after a long time of being apart. And then it suddenly fell apart after that. I don't know what happened, but I really didn't even care, and that was the problem. The intrigue was gone."
3,"Okay but not as intriguing as ""The Abduction of Julia""","I was somewhat dissappointed by this book, but i think if a person reads The first book first they would have a dislike for the Nick character and i was kind of dissappointed in Sara because Nick was only interested in her for a mistress and she wanted more. I kept thinking Sara look elsewhere you will just get your heart broken and she did. I think Nick should have gone through more character development."
4,"Really 3 & 1/2, but as part of the series, I give it 4","While not my favorite of the series, ""The Seduction of Sara"" is an enjoyable romp. Sara is not my favorite heroine; she's too bent on mischief without concern for the consequences. You'd think her ex-husband's escapades would push her into greater propriety. But Nick is an excellent character; his bouts with excruciating migraines are an interesting twist. Unfortunately, that problem is never really dealt with in any final way; only the accompanying problem of pain killers is addressed--and that without certainty.However, secondary characters Anthony & Anna and Delphi & Henri help make up for those deficiencies, as do the many incidents of comic relief. There is a poignancy to Nick & Sara's romance that also tugs at the reader's emotions.Not the best of the series, certainly, but welcome within the context of them all. Because of that, I'd recommend reading it in order."
3,The Seduction of Sara,"The Seduction of Sara was a good book but just didn't hold up to the other regency romance books I've read. The book had nice, enjoyable characters (even the secondary characters were well written about). I loved the characters Sara and Nicholas. Their story is a very interesting one during the last part of the book. The plot was just too slow paced until the last hundred or so pages. The storyline was good and the idea of the book was good, it just took too long to get to the interesting part. This book also has too many loose ends. The story ends without the reader really knowing how different situations were resolved. (If you read the book you'll know what I'm talking about!) The ending was OK, just too weak.If you're looking for a regency romance with lots of rakes, rogues and pretty Ladies and Lords, I would recommend the Mallory Novels by Johanna Lindsey. They are much more entertaining."
5,This is the first hawthorne book I read and will not be last,This was a great book!!!!!... I am also going to go back and read the abduction of Julia! I read this book in one day - I could not put it down!
4,Chrome & Helios Creed - 'Dual Forces' (MVD) Running time: 43 minutes,"Nice little Chrome / Helios Creed retrospect DVD. Features four 'original' Chrome videos from 1980-83, ""New Age"", ""Meet You In The Subway"" {maybe their most memorable}, ""Danger Zone"" and the unreleased ""Firebomb"". Also has three Helios videos - ""Your Spaceman"", the awesome ""Sandbox Jungle"" and ""Rant"". As well as some live footage from the 1998 Chrome reunion, where at this point of course Helios takes over on vocals. Last, anything but least some scenes of his most recent club tour from 2006. Almost forgot to mention the extras of humorous out-takes of a Chrome video shoot and band discography. True Chrome fans will love this DVD."
4,"MOVES A LOT OF AIR, BUT NOT QUIET AT LOWEST SPEED","MY 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAD IT ASSEMBLED BY THE TIME I GOT AROUND TO USING IT - SO I ASSUME MANY ADULTS WOULD NOT FIND ASSEMBLY TO BE A PROBLEM.STABILITY WAS NOT A PROBLEM. THE STAND, WHILE NOT HEAVY, PROVIDES AMPLE SUPPORT.THIS THREE-SPEED FAN MOVES A LOT OF AIR. AT THE HIGHER SPEEDS, YOU EXPECT i'D EXPECT TO HEAR THE MOTOR AND THE BLADES WHOOSHING THE AIR AROUND. AT LOW SPEED, I'D EXPECT BOTH TO BE MINIMAL. WHILE AT THE LOWEST SPEED, YOU CAN FEEL A BREEZE 6-8 FEET AWAY, THE NOISE (IN A NYC APARTMENT) IS LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD OVER OTHER SURROUNDING NOISES. YOU'D EXPECT IT TO JUST ADD WHITE BACKGROUND, WHICH MAY BE THE CASE FOR SOME, BUT I FOUND IT TO BE NOTICIABLE TO THE POINT THAT I HAD TO RAISE THE TV OR MUSIC VOLUME TO COMPENSATE. I SUPPOSE I WILL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR ONE OF THOSE MULTI-VARIBLE SPEED FANS WITH AN ATTENUATING SWITCH OR A LOT MORE THAN 3 SPEEDS."
5,A very value for money fan.,"I never go to the fastest. It has three modes, 90 out of 100 times, the slowest mode is sufficient. Very powerful, and value for money. Highly recommended."
1,Piece of Crap!!!,"This thing is a cheap piece of junk not worth $5.00! First of all it is suppose to be easy to assemble. The instructions were easy just put the pole in the base and twist till tight and do the same for the fan head. Well, even with all my weight and all my might (I weigh 190lbs), the fan head would not screw on. Needless to say I will be returning this piece of junk."
5,Excellent fan,Very easy to assemble; Very light & easy to move around; Extremely effective at moving air around & cooling things down. I don't know where the complaints about noise level come from. It's no louder than any other fan I've ever had & not as noisy as many of them. I couldn't be more pleased.
4,Nice Fan,"This fan is easy to assemble, and seems to work well. It is made of plastic I hope it holds up! The base at the bottom looks bulky, but it seems like it is stable and won't tip over very easy if bumped when being used around pets or children. I have not used it yet, but I have plugged it in and it seems to work well so far."
3,Fair. not very strong or much air but acceptable,"Fair but cheaply engineered. The stand pillar is the best designed part of the fan. You can raise and lower the fan without much difficulty but the tightening ring is a little stiff for weaker hands. The Fan tilting mechanism is pretty clumsy. Tilting the fan I found the be difficult and actually snapped the mechanism trying to force it to tilt. The osciliating mechanism is all plastic of course and that is what snapped. The fan cover snaps on and is cheap. The fan is not balanced and vibrate a good bit when on.Reminds me of a product whose price (and quality) are downgraded to fit in the WALL-SMARTS category of cheap products. Fair, it will do the job but Ill not buy another"
1,cheap materials & construction,"All of the parts of this fan are flimsy, cheap plastic. The blades are small & not very effective. The base of this fan is HUGE & takes up a lot of floor space (way bigger than pictured) I should have spent a couple more dollars & got a better quality fan."
3,Not that impressive,"I saw fans just like this (same brand name, same look) at the cheap big lots near me, but I went to amazon and spent a little more because this seemed to have good reviews, and I figured it was worth it to get better quality.The fan works ok, but it looks just as cheap as any other fan, so we'll see if it holds up. The most annoying thing about it though, is the base doesn't stay on, this is a terribly poor design, any time I go to pick it up the base falls off, and I have to grab that and bring it with me."
1,Don't bother.,"Fan grille won't snap together, so I can't even try using the fan. Lasko won't contact me about replacing the parts. I called Lasko, and they took all my info, then just said to send an email to a general email address. It has been a week and no response.Poor design. Poor customer service."
3,"Generally a good fan, some minor issues","On the whole I'm happy with the fan. Some problems with it are that on spin mode the fan vibrates a little and makes some extra noise, and the base of the fan is pretty large and takes a lot of space on the floor."
1,Completely worthless,"Worthless, just plain worthless. I purchased one of these fans a month ago, and it broke that very same night. I foolishly assumed that I had just gotten a defective one, but the replacement broke a week later. I'm not even going to try and get another replacement. I would very strongly recommend not purchasing a fan from Lasko, as they are simply broken junk."
3,Okay but not great,"I've been using this fan day and night for the past two months and it hasn't broken, yet. Yes, this fan is cheaply built with mostly plastic. The motor and support pole are metal but the pole is very light weight. The fan oscillates very well. If you want it to stay extended to the highest position, use a pipe wrench (not too tight, the plastic will break) or someone with a strong grip to tighten the locking twist mechanism. This is all acceptable to me. What's not acceptable is the lack of power the fan produces. It sounds like it's putting out quite a bit of air, but it's barely a breeze unless you're right in front of it. Might be okay for a bedroom, but not adequate for cooling a 24' x 20' living room."
3,An OK pedestal fan,"I'd rate this fan fair. Air movement is good. The fan post rotates in the base, which is a nuisance. The vibration of the fan motor causes the fan to rotate ever so slowly. You have to reposition the fan frequently. I had to glue the post to the based to solve the problem. The fan shroud is cheap plastic, not metal. For convenience, the controls should have been mounted on the post instead of on the motor. A few years ago, most pedestal fans had metal shrouds with controls mounted on the post. It seems that quality keeps going down while prices stay about the same."
3,"Good for the money, but not good in general","I purchased this fan to be used in my bedroom. I was hoping for 3 things:1) Silent fan2) Option for low speeds3) Good constructionWhat I got:1) Not silent fan (not even on low)2) Lowest speed is still quite fast3) All-plastic construction4) Moves quite a bit of airSo, in conclusion, this fan may be fine for an office, garage, finished basement, family room, etc. For a bedroom, I would shy away from this fan. If you are looking for a high quality piece of hardware, I would shy away from this as well."
5,Great buy,"Others had complained that this fan was noisy. Having somewhat of a hearing loss,for me this was not an issue. The fan really moves air extremely well. For thereasonable cost along with free ship how could you go wrong. Oh yeah, my wifehears really well, believe me, and she found the fan noise just fine."
2,Not Such A Good Value,This isn't the best fan on the market but after doing some comparison-shopping it's probably the best value. This simple fan works well and has three different speeds. It puts out plenty of airflow. It's a little loud on the high setting but so is pretty much every other fan that we have ever owned. Overall this fan has the power and will get the job done if you don't need a remote control.Update: This fan was dead after about four months. The motor went bad in the unit. I would suggest looking for another fan.
4,Moves air perfectly. Too Loud!,"This fan moves air around perfectly. On those hot summer evenings w/ your A/C blowing, this fan becomes the perfect compliment. Just one thing. This fan is a little loud. If you put the speed seeting to a one, the sound is exceptable but still quite loud. Don't put the setting on 2 or 3 unless you have ear plugs because it sounds like a freight train going through your house and your ears may begin to bleed(lol). Other than that, this fan is great! i would certainly recommend it."
4,"Not elegant, but works nicely","For $32 I didn't expect elegance, just a nice serviceable fan. And that's what I got. It's not superquiet but very livable in terms of noise level. The bottom speed pushes the air around nicely in our cathedral-ceiling family room. Best thing about the fan is that it really is easy to put together -- no tools, and the instruction sheet is comprehensible. I did it in twenty minutes and I'm no wizard!"
2,"Cheap, noisy, not good","The flimsy plastic grill is really the problem. You have to assemble the fan which wasn't too bad, but the back and front grill pieces are supposed to snap together. Mine only fit so-so, and the grill pieces themselves are made of surprisingly flimsy plastic. The fan also makes a kind of a soft high-pitched whining wind noise in addition to normal fan noise I would have expected.I would skip this one."
1,1820 performance is not,"I bought this fan to replace a 12 year old fan that started to fail.This fan arrived packaging was fine, however, the front gril doesn't seat properly, the fan when in oscillation, turn 360 degrees on the ""adjustable"" pedestal, also if you extend it out to the max, my product overnight works itself down to the lowest height level, also it makes a great deal of noise from the base of the fan.I can not recommend this product, and am now off to find a replacement after just one day of use."
2,"OK fan when it works, too noisey and flimsy","I was suprised at how noisey it was at the highest setting and it was not just the noise of the air moving, but an annoying noise in the motor itself. It does move air when it's working, but I've had problems with it, as the speed decreases on it's own sometimes as if the motor is burning out. I have to turn the fan off and then back on for it to work again.Also, too much plastic use makes it feel flimsy and breakable."
3,Loud,"The fan is extremely easy to assemble and works fine. It does a good job of moving plenty of air around a room. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is just too noisy. I bought it for my bedroom and it's just too loud to sleep with it on if you need a room that is relatively quiet to sleep in. It says ""3 quiet speeds"" on the box but is one of the loudest fans I've ever heard for its size. If you're looking for something that needs to be reasonably quiet, keep looking. I'm returning mine asap."
4,not assembled,"EVERYTHING WAS PRETTY EASY EXCEPT PUTTING THE FRONT ON THE FAN,BUT THE REST OF IT IS SIMPLE TO PUT TOGATHER"
3,"Lousy Assembly, Works Very Well","I have assembled many fans ( table top or stand ) in the past, so experience is not a problemLike almost all fans now, it's all made of plastic with an aluminum tube as the center post.It assembles like all the other types except for the front fan blade guard. It has plastic tabs that are supposed to snap into the rear plastic guard. If the alignment is off just a bit, the front guard will not assembleThey loose 2 stars, 1 for the terrible directions with lousy explanations and worse drawings....they also loose 1 star for the horrible front fan guard assemblyInstead of tabs to assemble, they should have used a screw or a clamp ( even plastic ) would have made assembly faster with much less swear words involvedFor the good partThe fan motion from side to side is 180 degrees and works wellThe fan adjustment for height is OKThe motor adjust for up and down is goodFan speeds are very good, quiet and moves a lot of air"
2,"Good, not so good that is the question","I bought 2 of these fans during the hot summer months. One worked well, the other worked too. What I found though was that 1 of the fans made the room smell like it was burning. I could not smell anything near the fan, but the smell persisted for a couple days. As soon as I removed the fan, no more smell! So is this product good, and most importantly, is it safe? Use with caution."
4,Fans do the job,Purchased for office. Made out of all plastic. Easy to put together. Put out a lot of air.
3,no blow,"I was going to return this product but decided to reengineer it and make it work as I really needed it. As it was it was useless. Not at all what we expected, very poorly made, I doubt it will last a year. This is a real piece of junk, don't waste your money, try something else you won't be happy with this. I'll bite the bullet on this one, you will be better off with something else, spend your hard earned money on something that will do you some good this will just give you a headache."
3,Hard to play for younger children,"The game is pretty good, but make sure your child has the necessary skills to play. I would recommend 8 yo or older. My 5 yo has a lot of experience with PC games, and some on the gameboy, but this game was difficult for her. BEING ABLE TO READ WELL IS A MUST FOR THIS GAME!! You can not go for 10 seconds without having to read paragraphs to be able to play and follow what you are supposed to do. Could have been more oriented for the targeted age group."
4,"Cute, durable but wish it was just a little bigger.","We purchased this almost 2 years ago when my daughter was 4. It's very durable, folds and unfolds easily - it's been dragged all around the house and has retained it's shape nicely. It's light weght so my daughter can move it and around and set it back up herself. At 6 years old, it still gets used but I think it's close to it's end of use. Now she prefers to make forts with sheets but that requires mom's help so this still works when mom isn't available. Our only complaint is that it's a bit small. Even at four, her and a friend could just sit in it. It doesn't fit two kids and a bunch of dolls - which is what she really wanted and why the forts with chairs and sheets has won out. But it has been used a lot as the 'snack room'. It's been used a lot and I would recommend it but if you find something similar that is slightly larger, I would say purchased that instead."
4,"A lot of fun, but the frame isn't the best!","We bought this for our daugthers 4th birthday because she always wanted me to make her a tent out of blankets and chairs.She loves to play in it, but it is a bit on the small side. You can really only fit one child in there comfortably. Two is alright if they're not to big, but then there isn't any room to take any toys inside.I have had some problems with the frame, occasionally if one of my kids leans on the side and knocks it over the frame will become deformed and then when you put it back up one side won't stand up straight and lean a bit. This is usually remedied by folding it up and bending it around a bit, but it is annoying."
4,Very plaesed,"My 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents. She loves the disney princesses and was ver excited. I was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down, she plays with it in her room almost everyday and I love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep. Overall we are very pleased with this tent, although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that I could play in there with her."
2,Disney Princess Castle is too flimsy,My kids have fun climbing in and out of this although there really is only room for one child at a time. I had it for one week and it's already fallen apart. The fabric is flimsy and the rod to give it somewhat of a frame has gone through the fabric therefore it collapses. Time for the trash on this one. It looked better in the ad.
1,Very disappointing....,"I was really excited when I picked up this tent at the store recently. It looked like something my 2 year old daughter would love and it was a reasonable price. Wow, were we disappointed when we set it up! It is nothing like the box pictures at first glance. If you study the picture on the box closely, you realize it is just a picture made to make the product look great and large at a certain angle. The picture really is accurate when you compare it to the tent though. This tent is only big enough for 1 child and it falls over constantly. We had trouble getting it to stand up at all sometimes. You have to spread out the bottom part as wide as you can in order to get any stability at all. The kids loved trying to get into it and then having it fall over though, so they did get a little entertainment out of it before I returned it to the store. I can't believe this product even made it to store shevles!!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"Everytime my daughter tried to go inside the castle, it fell over on her due to it being so flimsy and the lack of support at the bottom. Eventually she became frustrated and refused to play with it. Like I said, it's not worth the hassle."
2,Small and Not Like the Picture,"This was easy to set up, but it could use additional support at the bottom sides to keep up from collapsing. The footprint is very small and works well for one small child. Doesn't look like the picture you see online. Seems to be very durable and it is cute."
2,Don't buy this play tent!,"I thought I was purchasing a play tent for our two daughters that was a bit durable and would withstand some light day to day play and activity. I was wrong. This tent barely stands up on it's own. oh, and it doesn't even look like this photo that is listed on the website. The one we were sent is pink and it doesn't ""pop up"" like this photo makes it appear! We were very disappointed because when my daughters crawl inside of this tent, most of the time, it falls down on them!!!!"
2,Not very sturdy,"I bought this for my 2 and 1/2 year old this chirstmas. I was slightly disapointed. It wasn't as big as I thought it would be, and it has a hard time standing up on it's own. You have to prop the sides out for it to stay. Anyone that goes thought the door will knock it over, which is frustrating for a 2 year old. I had to set it up over and over. If my 6 year old tried to get in as well to play, it tipped over or there wasn't enought room. If I had known how flimsy it was, I would of spent the extra 10 dollars to get a framed tent."
3,Definately for an older child,"We bought this tent for our two year old daughter after observing her play in a similar tent at a friends house. Unfortunately, this tent isn't really for a 2 year old. She is still a little busy with all the in and out and in and out... she doesn't seem to enjoy it much yet. However, at 4 we will re-introduce it to her and perhaps she will enjoy it but as of now it justs collects dust."
4,Good choice,"We got this book for our 5 year old that always wants to help in the kitchen. She loves to help make the choice and then cook it up. So far, so good!"
4,!!!,"I only gave this four stars because I only have tried the mac & cheese, (which was very good!) I think it will be a very nice cookbook to have around. And I didnt use the dry mustard and it still came out great!"
4,interesting classical music collection...,"This is an interesting classical music collection that is as their personal favorites. My personal faves are by Manuel De Falla (selected by Steven Tyler), a Mozart piece (Keith Richards), Benjamin Britten (Paul McCartney) and Modest Mussorgsky (Trevor Rabin). It includes a 12 page booklet written by Boston DJ Carter Alan with quotes from each musician on why they choose what they did. The other musicians who picked their favorites include Bruce Hornsby, Elton John, Brian Wilson, Marianne Faithful, Michael Stipe, Bono and Frank Sinatra."
3,Made in Taiwan,A good set of metric impact sockets made in Taiwan. I'd have given it 5 stars had it been made in the USA.
4,Clean impact set,"I purchased the metric and standard sets to replace the slowly depleted impact sockets in my tool box. I have not had the chance to really abuse these sockets yet but they appear to be of good quality. My only complaint is that the sizes are only printed and not etched into the sockets. If you spin the socket against dirt or another object then it will wear off the print. I'll probably end up engraving the sizes once this happens. Otherwise, these are nice sets for the money."
5,Excellent set of sockets,This is an EXCELLENT set of sockets. No complaints. These sockets are easy to read and appear to be of very good quality. I have NO regrets with this purchase.
3,WORKS GREAT. NO PROBLEMS,"Put it on about 1 year ago. works great. do not quick release though. inital install was a bit tricky, but after that no problems. recommend."
1,No sizes,It would be a lot easier to order something with the size you want rather than having to return Items.. Patricia Cota
1,This is junk don't buy!,"I bought this part at the begininig of April 2012. I read the other poor reviews and was hoping that the quality had improved and it has not. It is now the middle of May 2012 and the part already broke, so it lasted long enough for me to mow about 8 or 9 times. Do yourself a favor and buy a better quality part, because this one is junk. I was looking for a quick easy fix and saw this part, I made a poor decision. Wish I would have bought an OEM replacement part, I hope others don't make the same mistake."
1,Poorly made,"It is very poorly made. It broke on the very first pull. If using on a motor where the handle is mounted a couple feet away from engine, (i.e. lawn mower) you will need to add that extra length. Seller refunded total amount after 1 day of emailing them! Very satisfied with them!"
4,Vampire for Grown-ups,"Twilight on steroids--this chick is off the hook! All the grown-up vampire lovers out there will enjoy this racy response to the blood-sucking craze. Sexy, scary and mostly a feast for the eyes, this is not your vampire romance flick!"
3,pretty good,There Is Hot vampire chicks in this movie emmmm...I like what ive seen so far from this guy its weird stuff.
5,Owners manuel for the human mind.,"Clear and descriptive insight into human brain physiology. A must read for anyone who owns, or knows someone who owns a brain."
1,cracked,"We bought 4 of these griddles to use at a family reunion and they are supposed to be preseasoned. We had to constantly add oil between each pancake application. The worst thing was that when we put them on the stove we used to cook, one of them cracked when it started to get hot. We were very dissappointed in the quality of the griddles. Roxie"
1,How does cast iron break?,"We recently purchased this griddle to use on a family camping trip with our Camp Chef stove. We left it in it's box until we got there, took it out of the box, and noticed a distinct crack right down the middle. We couldn't use it for anything which would possibly leak through (which rendered it pretty much useless). I was going to return the item but the return policy states that I am required to pay for the shipping which will not be refunded. Since the item weighs about 25 lbs, it is completely pointless to return as the cost of the shipping will far outweigh the cost of the griddle. Saying that, it was $35 which we may as well tossed out the window on the drive to the campsite."
4,does what it is supposed to do,I prefer having 2 griddles vs. one and this was a good deal on my second. So far it is a great piece of equipment but it does get a nasty hot spot. I am going to rig a heat diffuser at some point but for now it is fine.
1,Bad luck or a bad product?,"Purchased a while ago and didn't have a chance to use it. I tried to use it today on the Camp Chef brand stove, went cracked on me. I had so much confidence on the Camp Chef products before the purchase especially the stove. However, I don't know about this one, bad luck or just bad product."
1,KN-COB-B is crap,"We have had three of these units for less than six months. We also have two other CO units that are AC only that we have had for a few years.Just about every week one of these three units beeps very loudly for three or four beeps and then quits. This is very annoying when you are sleeping. It does not continue like it is a real alarm. They are not the soft chirps indicating low batteries. I have replaced all the batteries with new quality batteries instead of the cheap ones that come with the unit. Our regular, more expensive, CO units have never gone off at the same time as these cheap units. Buy the more expensive units.We do not think these are unsafe, just annoying."
2,False Alarm?,"I have had one of these alarms for a month or so, and last night it started going off while I was making dinner. I took the alarm outside and it stopped beeping, so I decided it was probably real and called 911. They came over and their detectors read absolutely nothing. So while I think a CO detector is an important item in every home, I worry about the accuracy of this one."
3,Basic Model = Disposable,"I've only had this for about 2-3 years, but now it won't stop giving the low battery beep even with fresh Duracells. I tried this over the course of a couple days. The description says replace after 7 years, and it has a 2004 manufacture date, so don't know if has built-in 'self destruct' circuitry.In the time I owned it, it never went off, so I have no idea of how it performed. I'll try another brand because Kidde has lost my business, and I'll make sure my next one has a recent manufacture date."
2,Throwing it out,"On the plus side the Kiddie Monoxide Alarm (model KN-cob-b-ca) is convenient to change the batteries and I don't have to worry about power outages. On the negative side it has started to produce a constant high-pitched sound as soon as I put the batteries in. I double-checked they are the correct batteries. It's very annoying! I can't find reference to this sound in any manual.It also appeared to give a false alarm - I checked with a second C0 2 detector and it did not register anything. Taking the unit outside it continued to give the four beep alarm even after the reset. I can't get rid of the high-pitched sound. I don't feel I can trust it. It was manufactured in 2007, says 4 year warranty on back, but 7 year warranty on the manual. I am sending it to the recycling depot and getting a different brand."
1,"Like everyone says, constant false alarms total piece of poo","I've had my unit constantly going off since I've put it in my home.New batteries, changed locations and it still goes off.I've had the fire department come to my home from my first ""false alarm"" and NiMo that same night. No carbon monoxide in my home at all. Will be throwing in the garbage and purchasing a new one from a reliable company. I suggest if you've been unfortunate enough to buy one that you do the same."
2,Built-In Obsolescence Hidden,"I bought this product from Home Depot. I think that it does an adequate job for the price.HOWEVER, when it needed a new battery, I read the instructions/specs on the back carefully. If replacement of the battery does not work, you should know that after 7 years, the device is programmed NOT to work and you must replace the unit (more likely I will buy a different brand). This information is not obvious in the manual and I only saw it on the back of the device. They should be more upfront with this information, but then maybe fewer people would want to purchase it."
2,Put it up somewhere away from people!,"I guess this item is good for the price that you pay for it.Ive had 2 of these and twice had a careless person knock it down, once off the countertop minutes after purchasing it and once off the top of the fridge (that was partially my fault for never putting that one up) But what Im trying to say is if you purchase this item NEVER let it fall on the floor after it hits the floor its no more good the alarm keeps going off even after moving it outside to fresh air. Dont even think you can call the PROFESSIONALS at Kidde and expect them to help because the RUDE customer service agent is just going to cut you off in the middle of you explaining the problen and tell you to go buy a new one!"
5,Filter upgrade,"This is a great product at a great price ,saved over $80.00 over what other's wanted for same exact item."
1,hawaiian chants,Should have listened to this before I bought. Not my cup of tea. Just some old hawaiian men shouting.
5,At last a long look at a decisive battle.,"Mr. Cooling's book presents a chronological evaluation of the events that preceeded and occurred after the Battle of Monocacy. Starting with why Lee ordered the last gasp invasion of the north, to the modern efforts to preserve the battlefield. All aspects of these events are presented but not evaluated. For example, why didn't Washington believe the people of the area when they reported that Jubal Early was in Maryland? Mr. Cooling also presents a wonderful driving tour for people who want to see and expirennce the places of the Battle of Monocacy. The appendicies go into great detail about the Ohio National Guard which fought at Monocacy, and the issues all the govenor's of the various Union states had to face when called to defend Washington. Perhaps if Jubal Early had not stalled outside of Washington, Monocacy would be celebrated as one of the greatest Confederate victories of the war."
5,A Man's Soap,"Woody's soap is the perfect answer for a man that will not move onto body wash or decent smelling natural soaps. It travels well and leaves behind a musky scent with no flowery overtones. I bought this for my new husband when he was reluctant to give up regular, greasy, bar soap. This soap is fresh, lasts a long time and leaves no residue."
2,Looking to fill an unneeded niche,"While it's well made, it just isn't really very usefull. It's much easier, and handier, to use a knife to smash garlic than it is to use this thing. All you need to get garlic smell from your hands is any piece of stainless steel, your sink, faucet or even some other utensil would do the same job."
4,La science-fiction burlesque...,"Des robots dépressifs, des extra-terrestres à deux ttes, un personnage nommé Ford Escort, et une planète qui se nomme Megrathmoilà.Douglas Adams crée un univers totalement tordu, hilarant et absurde à l'extrme. Le pauvre Arthur Accroc se fait exproprier de sa demeure, que le gouvernement veut remplacer par une autoroute - le jour mme où le gouvernement galactique veut détruire la Terre pour y faire passer une autoroute interstellaire... et ce n'est là que le premier de ses accrocs! Impossible de lire ce roman sans se tordre de rire à toutes les pages.Ah... Et la réponse à la Question sur la Vie, l'Univers et le Reste? C'est 42.Marrant."
3,Great gloves,"These gloves are great! I've owned two pairs now. They are comfortable, stop me from getting blisters, and help hold onto sticks better.The only problem that I have had was that the wrist support years from the glove and somehow in a month this.time I've managed to wear a hold in the glove on one of the fingers. If not for that I would rate a 5."
5,Worth every penny!,I bought these for my son. He and his band use my garage for their band practices. In the winter even with a heater it gets cold. They were great. Not only to keep his hands warm but for keeping him from getting blisters and for supporting his wrists.
4,"Classic Brazilian ""choro"" music, with a spacegrass twist","In the early 1990s, newgrass mandolin whiz Mike Marshall got the bug for Brazilian ""choro"" music, a mainly-instrumental Dixieland-ish style that's as old as the samba and three times as fast... He's joined here by folks such as Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Andy Narell and Brazilian-born pianist Jovino Santos Neto, in a surprisingly strong, cheerfully playful set... Lots of fun and performed with a real understanding for the music. Recommended!Note: this disc is an expanded version of the original 1996 album, now on the Adventure Music label (reissued in 2005), with three added tracks."
5,must have,si te gusta world music or string music debes comprar este cd. Mike marshall confirma su status de virtuoso y los musicos que tocan con el son excelentes. Este es uno de los mejores cds de mi coleccion y una inspiracion constante como mandolinista.
5,Satisfies the snack attack...,"I mix a bag of these with a bag of their ranch soy nuts then divide them up into 1/4 cup servings in their own snack bag for portability. This meets the Lindora requirement for one ""protein"" serving and satisfies my cravings for the cruncy/salty things I miss and also keeps me from being hungry. Of course, it's not chips but overall, this stuff is A-OK!"
5,It doesn't have to be goodbye,"This show is my all-time favorite. I spent many nights watching this show on local syndication. I can barely count all the times I fell asleep with the ""Love"" theme being the last thing I heard. These episodes are out there on videocassettes, and this book will help you appreciate even more just how funny this group of people are. If you're reading this, thanks for the laughs."
3,Guide for SOME episodes..,"By all means, buy this book for all of the reasons stated in the many raves in this section, but I'm not crazy about it. My taste runs mostly to Mike-Hosted episodes, and most of the seasons Mike did aren't covered in this guide. I was hoping for some real, groupie insider information on the MST crew, but it's just more off-the-wall goofing around like in the show. I'd be willing to pay much more for a real factual guide to EVERY episode, written by one of the many serious students of this show. Any takers??"
3,"Good but, not great","I was rather disapointed with this book. It is for referance I know, but when it was suposed to be funny in the forwards and prologe the jokes and funny stuff was [...] almost to where you think ""Guess you had to be there"". I have been a fan of MST3K for over 8 years and I can tell you that the show is much funnier and lets face it, the cast makes the jokes funny with action and voices.. but not text. I would infact recomend this if you need to find out what certain host segmants were in what episode, but for sitting down and just reading it [...] eh."
5,A MiSTie without this guide is like...Torgo without knees,If you are any sort of a MSTie then this guide of the earlier episodes should be yours. Very thorough and very good.
5,Gotta Have It,"This book is definitly one of the best I have ever read. If you have ever seen MST and like the show, this is a must have. It takes you back to the good 'ol days, before Comedy Centeral sold its soul to the devil, er, Sci Fi. It also brings you back to the reign of Joel, Dr. Forester, and (who could forget) TV's frank. Written by the cast, writers, editors, etc., it is sure to please any MSTie-type."
5,A splendid time is guaranteed for all,"Like Wilde, Dickens, and Ebert before them, the funny-makers who write and perform for ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" have put all their satiristic talents into this magnum opus of hilarity. While skewing the more horrid horror and science-fiction films of yesterday, the authors enlight and entertain at the same time. A must-read for fans and non-fans of the cult TV show alike. (Was that pretentious enough for ya?"
3,"need an update, please",The book is fine for what it covers. But I agree with other reveiwers that it's high time that this was updated to include ALL of seasons 7 - 10. I think that some of the Pearl Forrester era episodes are outstanding.
5,A must for the MSTie,"This book is essential to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan. The only flaw is that it was written when the show was still on the air. As a result, the last few seasons are not included. I HIGHLY encourage the writers to come up with a second episode guide, complete with all ten seasons, so that I, and the other MSTies out there, can rush to the bookstore and do our part to send the writers' children to college.This book gives episode run-downs (of the rotten movie and of the better host segments). It also lists off some of the groups favorite jokes and explains many of the most obscure ones. My fingers are tired from all this typing. Just buy it already!"
5,A hit with all ages,"We bought this game to play while on vacation, and it turned out to be a huge hit! Our blended family includes kids of ages 2, 5, 6, 8, and 11, and we were all hooked (parents included). The littlest one likes to watch, or pretend to play by holding a control. We found the skirmishes to be the best part,which can be played by between 1 and 4 players at a time. Five months later we're still playing it at least every couple weeks, which is unheard of in this household."
4,Shrek Is Good As A Party Game!,"Shrek Super Party is the best Shrek game ever made! After I played Shrek 1, I wasn't sure if I should play this one, but I did and am glad. You pick from six charcters: Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, Lord Farquaad, Mousuier Hood and Thelonius (why Thelonius?). It's very reminiscent of Crash Bash, Mario Party and Sonic Shuffle, only with Shrek characters. The graphics are hilarious! Each character has a super-inflated head. This may be a kid's game, but I'm 13, a huge M-rated game fan, and I still love this game. If you had to buy one Shrek game, buy this one!"
4,Fun for the family!,"This game is really great! But sometimes the announcer of the game (the magic mirror) gets a little on your nerves. I mean all the characters are from the movie which is good. Now all you have to say is... what are you playing? All of the games are mini games. There are 30 of them. Some of the games are lame. But some are very fun! If you like mini games that are family type, buy this."
3,"A bit monotonous, but still good gameplay","My six and eight year old kids like playing this game and can spend hours doing so. My six year old doesn't like the fact that the computer tends to beat him consistently in the 'Epic Battles', but as they continue to play the game, they are getting better at the various tasks. I'd recommend this game to families but just know that the 'Epic Battles' can be a bit trying on the patience for older players."
5,THE GREATEST GAME EVER IN THE HISTORY OF X BOX!!!,"I love this game!!! Me and my friend love it. We are practicing the tournament now. Thelonious, Lord Farquaad, Shrek and Monsuier Hood are always playing the TV people and my friend always is Donkey and I am always Princess Fiona. We always lose, though but we keep practicing. My favorite one is Dragon's breath. I recommend this Super Party to anyone who likes X Box games."
1,Depressing story,"I bought this book after hearing of the death of the author, Beryl Bainbridge. Well, sorry to say, I found it a thoroughly depressing and boring read."
4,A good knife but Quality Control was poor,"The knife is solid and very comfortable in hand, however, when I got it new, the blade is slightly bent. I expect it to be in almost Perfect condition, but it's not."
5,Great Utility Knife!,This is the knife my wife and I use the most. Comfortable grip and well balanced. It is easily sharpened (I've used theWüsthof 2-Stage Knife Sharpener). We've been using this knife for four years now with no complaints.
5,Quik Release Backpac,Just the right size for my 22 lb. Jack Russell.Easy to put on & remove.Only thing no instructions or suggestions added with pac.helps to tire him out!
2,scissors and paste,"The author has done a good job of scouring the antenna literature and summarizing all of the equations in one place. The problem is the lack of any discussion about what the equations mean. I am reminded of the definition of a college education given by Prof. McWhorter of Stanford, ""the process of the professors notes becoming the student's notes without having passed through the mind of either.""If you are an experienced antenna designer, this book will be of help. If you want to learn from scratch, try the 50 year old book by Kraus."
3,Not so good,"This book is an excellent reference if you are looking for an extensive resourse of many kind of antennas and information about them. But if you are interested on study antennas in a rigorous way, please, don't waste your money. This book treat a large number of antenna parameters before talk anything about the radiation problem in a serious way. Many questions arise from reading the first two chapters without any knowledge of potentials problems and their solutions that leads to Green's functions. I preferred classic books like Weeks or Elliott books. In conclusion: Not so good."
2,Major cdrom issue,"I Just would like to let all potential buyers know of the problem with the included cdrom. In these date and age, I've no idea why would the author and/or publisher use an outdated copy protection on the CD. The CD only operates under early version of windows xp (32 bit only.) User will not be able to use it with recent windows (i.e, vista, 7, 64bit xp...), nor does it work under Unix, Mac OS, or Linux. The cd file contents are all scramble when open in an unsupport OS. For those of you that use virtual machine, it will not work there either.This is a text book; why would they copy protect the content? This is extremely shortsighted from a wellknown author and/or publisher. They should have follow MIT's open course ware policy so that the higher education can be benefit to everyone."
3,Good but damaged,This is a very good book! Highly recommend but i received it damaged from the cover and the spine. Some pages are falling out... No time to return because needed ASAP
5,One of the best soundtracks of the past ten years,"Blending an original score by Wojciech Kilar with complementary pieces by Schubert, this recording creates a definite mood. One of my favorite original pieces is the opening track, ""My Life Before Me"" which is so evocative that it's hard not to be touched by it in some way. This is not a sountrack full of generic, John Williams-like orchestrations; rather, each piece stands on its own.It's not necessary to be familiar with either the film or Henry James' original novel to appreciate this great soundtrack; while I may have some problems with the creative choices made by the director of the film, this disc is one of my all-time favorites of any genre."
4,extremely touching,"I was first introduced to this movie by my aunt Sandra who claimed I would love it. I am a ""period"" film fanatic and she knew it would ""get to me"" eventually. It wasn't until I went off to college that I could actually even consider renting the film while I worked at a video store. When i finally brought it back to my dorm room tired and worn out from a hard days of work, I became mesmerized and awakened by such a film. It couldn't have been as touching if it weren't for the blissful, poignant music. My heart ached when I heard the score. I knew after that I had to purchase this soundtrack. It is must for anyone who likes film scores and the movie itself is a must for any female who wants to know what an honest to God lady is."
1,Manonmoon,Subject matter interesting but this is not even close Blu Ray quality. A complete rip-off to call this Blu-Ray especially for the extra cost. Amazon let me down.
1,no need for blu ray - its all worse than SD,I was hoping for better video but wow this is just plain awful. There is no need for blu ray here if its on normal dvd save some cash. I was expecting much more. there is NO HD on this disc at all... I was hoping they converted the film stock to better resolution for blu ray but the stock is sooo bad there is no hope..... now why discovery could do a lot better with when we left earth just shows that this was a lazy cbs effort.....
3,Poor man's version,"This set was disappointing. The Apollo 11 coverage was a poor truncation of the excellent 1989 video version. Additional features were some old color-faded NASA versions of other missions, plus a few bits of archive ""behind the scenes"" film. The archive clips, although of poor quality, were the best features. If you want just one souvenir of the whole Apollo programme, at this price (or cheaper!) it's worth buying.Could have been a lot better. Must try harder."
1,Misleading!!! only for nostalgia buffs.,"The only people I can think off, who MIGHT like this, are those who ACTUALLY SAW these broadcasts and have some nostalgia, or maybe a feeling of ""comfort"", by watching them as is.Video quality is PATHETIC... taking a video copy STRAIGHT from the broadcast source, which means that EVEN STUFF SHOT ON FILM looks blurry and deteriorated... SERIOUSLY deteriorated.You can actually see all the video imperfections... it's like the worst VHS copy ever done.THis is not worth getting a Blu Ray disc... heck, it's not even worth putting out in VHS."
5,pronunciation pairs tapes,We were very plaeased with the tapes and they came on time. We would be happy to use this company again.
5,"breathtaking, unforgettable.","This book is a real literary treasure. I read it first as a teenager. It astonished me then, with its unique portrayal of Africa. Who could fail to love the African wilderness and its diverse people after reading The Flame Trees of Thika?! Africa seen through Huxley's youthful eyes is given a magical quality I have never again encountered (though BBC came close to portraying it in their rendition of this book). And it continues to astonish me now, twenty years later (oh dear, I have dated myself). The spectacular visual imagery from that book are a treasured keepsake, and the book itself is nothing less than a 20th Century masterpiece. It is a priceless gem and well worth the cost."
4,Flame Trees of Thika,I thought the book was very good as far as it went. Since the author evidently wrote from childs view 40 yrs after the fact she could have attached parenthetical elaborations that would have make events more clear.
3,flame trees of thicka,"considering i've been hearing what a great story Flame Trees of Thicka was and that it was a classic (I've never seen the movie, though I like Hayley Mills) I just couldn't enter into their world. There were vague timelines, ages, relationships and so on."
2,"Has a good Title, but that's all","This isn't worth your money. If you want to buy it, check out the rental movie first to see if you even like the story and characters."
3,Resemblance to 'Out of Africa',"Somehow reminded me very much of the best-movie (1986?) Out of Africa(Meryl Streep,Robert Redford,Klaus-Maria Brandauer), but not as wonderfully acted. Since it's a 6-7 hour 2-disc movie, it plays a lot longer and slower than Out of Africa, and didn't exploit Mozart's music as much."
4,Wonderful observations of a young girl in Africa,"I was amazed at the detailed observations and understanding of Elspeth as she arrives and becomes exposed to African life. I learned a lot about the ""little things"" in the day to day life of the people she was exposed to. She also showed a good contrast between Britsh thinking and lifestyle and African thinking and lifestyle. The only complaint that I have is that the writing seemed a little dry and tedious at times."
4,"Darker, Heavier Crue","It's really a shame that this album didn't do better. John C. stepped in at just the right time when Vince's voice had started to become tired and unoriginal. John's voice is a harsher, raspier voice that seemed to bring out the heavier, crunchier side of the Crue. Songs like ""Smoke The Sky"", ""Hooligan's Holiday"", & ""Power To the Music"" are sonic giants. Too bad the public couldn't get over the 'Vince Days' and give this new Crue a chance. Definately worth a listen."
4,"creativity, is what this album is all about","This is the direction that the crue took when they got tired of everyone trying to tell them what type of music to make. Sorry this album does not include the original line-up, it has John Corabi (from the scream) on vocals. Unfortunatley not many people liked the sound, or the agression behind this album, but it does show a lot of talent."
3,Ulf Wakenius - Notes From The Heart,"There are some beautiful tracks here, but mixed with not-so-good ones which are lacking much in production value, like just a basic riff going over some simplistic track. Jarret has much better tracks, at least these should be chosen well, not play it as secure. The good ones are few and worth listening to, but this album is inconsistent in quality of material. Average album, yet ideal to buy anyway for some few good tracks."
1,Not suoitable for sun solaris 10 security exam,"Took sun solaris 10 security exam today, the exam is very heavy on containers (Global vs non global, how to configure BART in global environment and will it flow down to non global), how to perform patching in global and non global environment, what is easiest way to setup 20 containers inside the same machine, definitions of key terms in Kerberos, what does kerberos each component do (drag and drop) and SFM and ipsec and ip filters syntax to block dns lookup. How to update the system automatically and what commands to use for automatic updating choose all correct commands . The textbook only covers 30% of the solaris 10 test only."
5,Flat Panel Monitor SAVES SPACE!,Using the Compaq FP745A flat panel monitor with my Compaq Presario 5410 computer saves precious desk space. The system was good to go just plugging it in out of the box. No need to battle with bulky monitors any more! The screen is 100% clear to the edge.
2,TOO MUCH FLUFF KEYBOARDS!!!!,"Im a Hollies freak. On this album, recorded live with Graham Nash, they sing as good as ever. At times a heck of alot better than CS&N; live.However, all the cool guitar parts from their hits are replaced here with a lousy cheapo fluff 80's keyboardS and it really sounds awful. Classic signature guitar riffs are omitted and played on a synth like a cheap vegas lounge act. What a big let down and a weird surprise that Nash would be in favor of reuniting with this great vocal guitar band who's trademark riffs are now done on a DX7.Shame on the Hollies...They sing great but sound like an bad oldies act smothered in keys. RIP Hollies.John Belandwww.johnbeland.com"
3,Are You a Godzilla Fan?,"If not, pass. The main fun of this game is simply controlling those beloved giant monsters on your GBA - the game depth & mechanics aren't gonna blow you away. In fact this game takes me back to the original Game Boy games I had ages ago - simple, repetitive, and truly fun, but to a point. That said, if you are a fan with a GBA, look for a good price & give it a try. Odds are you'll find stuff to keep you interested. The graphics & animations are great, and the custom mode is where the replay lies. You'll wish it was a little deeper, and with more arenas & characters...6 more months of development woulda made this game a classic. As is it's solid but half the game it should be - though light years better than the Godzilla games of yesteryear!"
2,The novelty wears off quickly...,"It's weird. If you're like me, when you're interested in a game, you go online and research. Check the reviews etc. the problem is: there's just no consistency on these reviews! So I took a calculated risk and bought Godzilla: Domination. Not the best use of your hard earned gaming dollars. The graphics are nice, the control is so-so, the sound, very simplistic. The real problem is that this game is quickly reduced to button-mashing. There are only a few basic moves available but they are all the moves you need to beat this game in about 20 minutes. That's right, TWENTY MINUTES! You can literally trap an opponent in a corner and just never let them up. BOOOOORING! The special moves are cool but you don't need them, in fact it will take you longer to learn how to use the special moves effectively than it will to beat the game by simply pressing ""A"" or ""B"" repeatedly. Take a pass, trust me on this."
4,Not worth the usual 30 smackers.,"It is a very fun game, but it gets tiring. It is more of a think fast game than a witts game. It is really easy. I beat it in about half an hour. Not that challenging. I still love it!!! This game does'nt last long, but i enjoyed it. I reccomend it for children age 6-12."
4,Little Rock Central High 50 Years Later,"I bought this video to coincide with my teaching the book ""Warriors Don't Cry"" by Melba Pattillo Beals. The information about the changes that have (and haven't) taken place at Little Rock Central High was very eye-opening. I enjoyed the contrasting viewpoints from one staff memember to the next regarding race and school performance. My students also formed a great understanding of the Little Rock community as seen by varying community members. The economic differences between races was particularly eye-opening.The only complaint I have is that there was not much footage shown of Little Rock Central High throughout the years from 1957 to 2007. I would like to have seen more about the Little Rock Nine and students who followed, integrating the school in later years."
5,Little Rock Central; 50 years later,Very powerful in and insightful representation of the events at Central in Little Rock and what has happened since.
5,Pick up your socks,"This is a must for all parents of young children, saves you a bunch of headaches, gives you good tools to work with."
5,Great practical information for parents of all ages.,This book has some great information for all parents and also makes you think about the choices you make as a parent. The chore chart is amazingly helpful and I have used in many times as an example of what it appropriate in terms of skill development.
3,Not so practical advice,"I knew I'd spent too many years picking up after my kids because it was ""easier"" than fighting them to do it. I thought this book would provide me with some practical strategies to begin teaching them to pick up after themselves (they are 3 and 6). I found this book read like a textbook. The information is good but it's very much presented like a college lecture. I had also hoped to get some ideas about what was age appropriate for them to do and didn't find much information along that line. Borrow it from the libary (that's where mine will be going)."
2,A boring account of what really happened,"The author obviously put a lot of time and effort into this book. The problem is that the book is filled with too much antiseptic detail and not enough emotion. The author is constantly referring to the identification number of the helicopters and reads from casulty cards. There is far too much detail and far too little of the on the edge of the seat action for the ametuer military history enthusiast. The book does discuss all of the action, but not in the riveting manner as say, E.B. Sledge in ""With the Old Breed"". This is a good reference book but not a page turner."
4,Biology in Physics,"Bogdanov has written about biological processes from the viewpoint of a physicist. The ten chapters may be read in any order to obtain an intelligent introduction or review for any of the topics, which deal with the electrical nature of life, the functioning of muscles, respiration, circulation, and so on... The presentations are clear, light-hearted, even funny on occasion -- a great and unusual accomplishment for a science text that does not talk down to its readers. The book is well illustrated and clearly written, although the text occasionally becomes a bit convoluted. This may be the result of its translation from Russian. The author provided a very thorough and up-to-date set of references for skeptics as well as for those who wish to dig deeper."
4,What fishing really means to those who cast their lines into the water,"To the person not interested in fishing, the passion of the dedicated angler is incomprehensible. Hundreds of dollars will be spent, hours of time expended, all to catch a few fish that could be purchased for the price of the gas of transport. However, these doubts fail to appreciate the spirit of fishing, something my parents have, but I do not.This book is an attempt to communicate exactly what fishing means to the people who partake. Dedicated fisherpeople view it as a cleansing mechanism, a way in which to go back to a more primitive hunter/gatherer existence. Hoover does an excellent job in describing what fishing really is, not a way to obtain food, but a way to obtain peace and of course something to brag about."
2,WHEW! STINKY!!!,"I don't know what the deal was with this toy. I did not purchase through Amazon. I found it at a major pet store in a nearby town. It looked PERFECT for my African Grey Congo. I figured it would be safe enough she couldn't harm herself. As soon as I took it out of the package, it REEKED like some kind of rotten rubber. I washed it and let it air dry. I could not get the over powering stench out of it. I was afraid to give it to my parrot. I just threw it away. I don't know if that was unusual or what was going on. It wasn't worth my time or gas money to even bother taking it back. I now stay away from that brand. Has anyone else had any kind of experience?? Were you able to get rid of the odor?? Thanks."
3,Smells bad and oily to touch,"Product itself is great, but when I received the toy I had to wash it really well b/ c it smelled strong chemical and very oily to touch. Is it still safe for birds? It doesn't say to wash prior to giving to birds."
3,Decent knife,"Purchase this to go with a bunch of other Four star knives I have in my block. It's a decent knife but nothing spectacular. If I didn't care for ascetics as much I'd buy the Victorinox knives as they tend to keep their sharpness. This knife has not, and within a few months of light use it lost it's edge."
2,Another disappointment,"I've got a $4.95 paring knife that cuts and slices better and easier than this one. Just like the kitchen shears I bought from Henckels, I'm very disappointed in this item. Expected much better quality for the price. Good-bye Henckels!"
4,do I need it?,"i bought it, because my girlfriend is scared about big knives. and its sharp, has a nice handling and so tiny.......so i barley use it, by it looks nice and my girlfriend accept it. I always take my 12"" chef or 6,5"" santoku. depends what to cut.so overall:pro:- nice knife- sharp- well balanced- cheap- good for tiny taks like... peeling a fruit? chooping a single cellery, removing fat from chicken breast...cons:- i really don't use it thst often, so was a waste of money, buy a 6"" utility insteadfour sars because it's a nice knife!"
2,too light weight,"This knife is sharp and cuts well but feels too light in the hand. Compared it to same size 20 year old Sabatier knife -- Sabatier feels heavier, more balanced and the blade is thicker. Disappointed with Hennckels."
5,great little knife,"hey, it's by Henckels, so it's got to be good. And it is. A nice feel, the right length of blade, holds its edge well, but is also easy to re-sharpen. Great value."
5,great,perfect handle. sharp edge. cleans easily. haven't cut myself yet. come on guys... it's a Henckels. a fine product.
5,Choice little knife,"I didn't think I'd ever again buy a German or French made kitchen knife: too heavy, too thick compared to Japanese knives. The reviews suggested that this knife was well made with a thinner blade and it was half the price of the next closest Japanese knife. Worth a try. Very nice knife. Light, sharp, good in the hand, and easy to clean. Initial very sharp edge has stayed sharp a long time where the French blade it replaced would have had to have been sharpened at least twice. Worth the money."
5,very handy,"I love this knife! It's very sharp, it feels great in my hand and the size is very comfortable for cutting small things like mushrooms and for peeling the skin off of apples, etc. It also doubles as a chef's knife for my 3 year old daughter who loves to cook with mommy and daddy in the kitchen (closely supervised, mind you!) I also really like my 4 inch version:J.A. Henckels Twin Four Star 4-Inch High-Carbon Stainless-Steel Paring Knife. I really like having both, but if I HAD to choose between the 2, I'd go with the 4 inch knife. The 4 is a little less comfortable for peeling and stuff like that, but it still does a good job with it and the extra inch is quite handy for slicing apples and what-not."
3,"Wordy, but good coverage","This book gives broad coverage of the topic and the author obviously enjoys sharing his experience. The book would have been easier to read with better organization and fewer tangental stories, but overall I learned quite a bit. The material is getting a bit dated at this point."
5,4th in the Pavarotti and Friends charity concerts,"Live from the Parco Novi Sad, Modena, on 12 September 1995, in the presence of Diana, Princess of Wales, Pavarotti brings us his fourth spectacular charity concert, this time in aid of a music therapy centre being built in Mostar by War Child. As is usual with these concerts, Pavarotti brings together artists from all musical genres, and even does duets with some of them including Meat Loaf, Michael Bolton and Dolores O'Riordan. Track #2 is an astonishing blend of opera and rap...who woulda thunk it! The finale is Pavarotti's calling-card ""Nessun Dorma"" in which he is joined by the many other guests. Rap, folk, rock, opera, gospel and sacred music build a musical bridge in aid of a worthy cause."
2,Phony guy sang the songs,This would be a good CD if it featured the original artists. Some phony guy sang all the songs and it sounds horrible. Don't make the same mistake I did in buying this CD.
2,Go with a spring loaded release instead,"After several trips out using these Canon stackers, we've found them to be a huge letdown. These were used for trolling for Coho and King Salmon and Lake trout in Lake Superior Minnesota. They ended up causing us more problems than they did help catch fish. The tension is to far too tight in them, and it doesn't allow the line to release. In a spring loaded release, there is a lot more give to them. But with these when you are setting your lines, they either the don't release the lines at all or the line slides right through the runner padding, not allowing you to get a proper set on your rod. We've have tried to loosen them up some, but even after doing that it still seems like it's 50/50 if they will work. You have to give the rods an extremely hard pull to pop the line of the release and on some occasions we have had to crank up the downriggers and manually release them. For future purchases, I plans to just order the spring loaded releases instead."
3,"Ok, but I like the original much better, Amazon verified perchase","The modernization is simply multiplying costs and earnings by 1000. No real change here. The names of properties are changed, which is kind of interesting and sometimes funny. The colors are pastel instead of the bright ones of the classic version, making it harder for me to read on the screen. The versions are basically the same, and I much prefer the classic one."
2,Huge numbers make this drudgery,The animation slows the play and the real estate prices in the millions mean you are forever adding and subtracting 7- figure and up numbers.. Probably more fun for someone who has not played the original game. The new property names are clever but I miss Broadway & Park Place. . .
4,Good but error-prone,"Once you get past the muddled first chapter, this book provides a good treatment of XSLT. However, it is in bad need of a technical editor, as there are numerous errors of the kind not caught by a spell or grammar checker."
2,Dazed and Confused,"As a web application development professional, I purchased this book to attempt to come up to speed quickly on XSLT. In particular, I'm interested in using it to transform XML generated by a JSP Tag Library into HTML for browser compatibility. I was disappointed because this book was literally impossible for me to follow. It is jam-packed with information, but the author assumes far too much in his writing. If you are extremely familiar with XML, this may be a good book for you. If not, I would suggest you look elsewhere. I'm returning my copy."
5,Useful book,"All of those useful little tidbits of information people always end up learning the hard way are in this book. There is almost too much useful consumer information in here. I am sure this book will save me a huge amount of trouble later in life. If you've ever wanted a book that could instill years of knowledge and experience to help you out with all sorts of monetary concerns, this is the book for you."
5,It is filled with many benefits and future savings.,"I was impressed with the sheer volume and accuracy of the information contained in this book. It is filled with many benefits, and the future savings in dollars is just amazing."
1,Not What I Expected,"The title of this book may be misleading to some who have come to define the word ""spiritual"" in more of a New Age context. I found some nuggets of ""spiritual"" wisdom in the author's words. However, unless you believe that the two types of people in this world are ""Christians"" who are going to heaven and ""non-believers"" who are going to hell, you might find this book very disappointing."
1,Pure looniness,"A great read, if only for the entertainment value. The author is paranoid, even going so far as to suggest Clinton would impose martial law in the ludicrously unlikely event of a Y2K meltdown. The author is also plainly a member of the loony Religious Right, and his disdain for homosexuals and non-Christians is thinly veiled. Now that Y2K has passed harmlessly, pick up a copy at your local used bookstore or Goodwill for laughs."
1,"Hawaiiana yes, Tiki no!","You gotta be kidding me? Any Tiki fan would find this book worthless. It does include some nice history of Hawaii especially in reference to Tiki but that is where it abruptly ends.The fluffy Tiki Of America chapter contains tacky clip art images, images copied from Sven Kirsten's Book of Tiki, and fairly common non-Tiki imagery. The writing throughout is very weak and sounds like a string of headlines/jargon rather than independently researched information. The Don the Beachcomber info seems informative, unless you already own Scrounging the Islands with the Legendary Don the Beachcomber.The book is barely saved by the last segment, Tiki Of Today, which attempts to tie the current Tiki trend into modern day Waikiki."
2,Is Sony in bed with the RIAA or what???...,"I purchased this memory stick to use for MP3s on my Sony Clie NX70V...but when I tried to transfer MP3s to it, I got an error that MP3 cannot be saved on a MagicGate card due to possible copyright infringement issues...Granted the MP3s I was trying to transfer were freshly ripped from CDs that I BOUGHT and ripped for my own use, but that small detail is apparently less important then the POSSIBILITY of someone breaking a copyright law...There are 256MB memory sticks that do not have the MagicGate ""technology""...I'd recommend getting one of those instead."
1,Just another expensive flash media,"This won't work in pre-2003 Sony devices, as Sony made a design mistake on original memory stick (and kept its consumers in dark). Neither would existing card readers work.These sticks contain MagicGate protection. This means that you won't get even 244 MegaBytes of actual space from this 256 MillionBytes stick. MagicGate uses up significant space and create all kinds of hassles in transfers of things like mp3's.But wait that's not all, these sticks are kinda obsolete already. These won't work in any SonyEricsson cell phones or smaller Sony devices like Stick Walkman & newer U series Cybershot cameras.If you want to invest in sticks buy a MS Duo Pro, the latest of half a dozen stick formats from Sony. (Soon most cell phones will have a slot for removable flash media) Or you can say no to all Sony devices and buy SD/MMC based gadgets to avoid all these hassles."
4,"As an only option, go for it...","The memory stick pro is just like its predecessor, the normal memory stick, a very small storage device for sony products. The 256MB one is in fact only 227MB because of MagicGate protection or something. Since most Sony products do not store data on anything other than memory sticks, the storage options are pretty narrow when buying a Sony product such as a digital camera. I think the price should go down a bit more and I think they should sell the sticks with an effective storage label (in other words when it can only store 227MB, advertise it as a 227MB stick). Other than those minor problems the stick works great, stores data and transfers quick and easy."
2,Problems with Notebook Recognizing Magic Gate Technology,"I'd give Sony an F for allowing this product out the door. My Sony regular memory stick always worked fine in my Toshiba Satellite P25 with built in memorystick slot.Now, I used two of these Magic Gate Sticks to document an overseas trip and I'm stuck because the notebook cannot read the Magic Gate format. I'd avoid anything that says magic Gate."
1,Does not work in some cameras,"Please check to see if your camera is compatible with the PRO stick. My camera will take a Sony memory stick but not a Sony memory stick PRO. Too bad I opened the package before I figured that out. This might be great storage, but if you don't have a compatible product, you won't be using any of it."
4,Sony Memory Stick Pro,"This is a great way to store photos or mpeg movies. It is small enough and works great most of the time. I have a small problemwith it, it does not always read.. My camera says ""no memory stick available"" when in fact it is in my camera. not sure if it is a memory stick problem or a camera problem...although I will purchase again."
1,"Doesn't work on my ""OLD?"" Sony camera","I am disappointed that Sony does not advertise, announce, or otherwise let the consumer know that this memory stick does not work on ""OLD"" pre-2003 Sony devices. I purchased this for my ""OLD"" 2001 Cyber-Shot DSC-F707 5.2 mega pix camera. When I inserted it I got memory stick error message. I then inserted this into my ""OLD"" 2002 Sony U10 and got the same message. It is worthless to me. Unless you own a 2003 or newer Sony, this will not work for you."
1,Doesn't work with my printer,What a disapointment! I got it because it was suppose to be faster to download. Its not compatable with my HP photosmart printer. I'm returning it for the non-pro!
1,This is not a memory stick,"I don't know what this is. I put it in my Minolta G500 camera and while the camera knew it was there, I could not access the memory. ATTENTION SONY. Someone should lose their job for letting this poorly designed product out the door. I bought it (and paid a higher price) because this was Sony.JUNK, TRASH, GARBAGE"
4,G'day mate!,"Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is definitely a successful start for Krome Studios. I first enjoyed this game when I was 11-years-old, lost it, and decided to order it again after so many years. I enjoy it as much as I did the first time. Nice job, Aussies! :)"
2,"Fun game, but graphics are too intense.","I received both the first and second games as gifts when I was 10 years old. I tried playing both. After playing the first game for about an hour or two, I went downstairs to eat dinner. The intense graphics of the game caused me to become nauseous. I had to lay down and could not eat. I felt sick to my stomach and felt like I could barely swallow or breath. I never played the game again. The second game made me too dizzy to play for very long. Stick to Jak and Daxter."
4,Buy this!,"I rented this game when it first came out because it looked cute. I was hoping it might be a little like Spyro and it is! I loved it so much I bought it. I really wish that they had made a strategy guide though, because just like the Spyro games, it's important to collect everything!! There are hidden pictures, red gems, etc. Plenty of mini-games to make things fun and interesting. Having it be beatable but not too easy was a plus and I really hope they make a TY 2! If you like Spyro, you will like this! The FIRST game since Spyro I have loved. I don't know why the reviews weren't very good though. Better game than Jak,Ratchett, and Sly Cooper. <sigh>"
1,Too Expensive,"At this price it is much cheaper to buy the tea at a grocery store, any grocery store."
5,Leaders Read,"A life changing book! Easy to read and full of practical, applicable information. If the principles in these stories are applied to everyday life, it can make everyday extrodinary."
4,I love this knife!,"I'll admit it up front; I'm a hardcore Henckel's fan. I know there are more expensive knives out there, but I prefer these. I purchased this knife to replace one, that I suspect, went out to recycling with a pizza box. It's got a great edge on it. I find myself reaching for it more than my santoku's now. It's a bit lightweight though. If it weren't for that, I'd gladly give it a 5-star rating."
5,Fillet knife,"What can be said, it's a Henckels. I purchased it to replace my original. Lesson learned; don't use the knife to open a can."
1,be careful,"this product arrived with mold and unuseable, however, amazon is such a great online shopping place that they gave a full refund for the product"
5,16 quart Faberware stock pot,"My husband brought me this pot over a year ago.........I LOVE IT!!!! I have cooked everything from soups and stews to king crab legs.... awesome pot................best of all it cleans up very nice.I love it so much I brought my daughter one......she has a large family She also thinks this is a awesome product.She does alot of cooking and agrees this is a very useful item in her kitchen.It is made very well and of stainless steel,it even cooks Faberware this is a great product!!!I am sure we will both enjoy many years of cooking."
4,Very big pot,Its bigger than I imagined but it is made well and I accidently turned the eye on that it was sitting on for some time and it became super hot but did not damage it. It will work well for boiling water canning also.
5,Excellent Stainless Steel cookware,One more piece of Farberware for our collection. Great Value. Was in use first day it arrived.
5,beautiful,"This is a beautiful pot & I couldn't wait to cook with it but I originally purchased it as a gift and well, dang pot wouldn't fit on the stove! Unfortunately, I had to send it back & use the $ to buy something else. But the quality was amazing."
4,"This pot just works right, and I'm glad I bought it.","The only thing I don't like about this pot is that the handles get hot along with the rest of it, so I have to remember to keep hot pads resting on the lid or I'll get burned. But it cooks exactly the way I like, is a perfect size, and is beautiful to boot."
4,Beauty and the Feast,"We often make large pots of ""Sunday gravy"" and this pot does the best job of the many we've used over the years. It's roomy enough for 12 cans of tomatoes (yes, 12!) and 6 pounds of meatballs. Best of all, after 8 hours of simmering the gravy, NO burned food at the bottom! All that, and beauty, too. Just make sure you have ample shelf space to store it; 16 quarts is larger than most cabinets will accommodate."
5,Heavy Duty Stock Pot,I actually bought this for my husband and he loves it. It is nice and heavy and there are no hot spots.
2,Not Good for Children Under 4yrs,"My twins were so excited to get this camera. Unfortunately, the button that needs to be pushed to change each picture is too difficult for my 3 year olds so they don't play with this toy at all now. May be better for 4 years and up."
3,Didn't occupy her long,"I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. It did occupy her for about one hour, and then she put it away. Don't recommend it."
5,Best crashes ever,This has to be one of the best games around. It has a crash mode so you can simply total your car and many other people's cars. A must buy.
4,Pretty Good,"I just got this game yesterday and it is almost perfect but it can get really annoying when it takes so long to load the games. It is good because you have a scence that you are in the car and you want really drive the car. The one things that they could do to improve Burnout 2 is to use brand-name cars. Instead, they use things like ""Roadster"" or ""Hot Rod"". Even what I don't understand is how they came up with the name ""Oval Racer"". It looks just like a Nascar Race car. All in all, I would buy this game."
3,It Gets Boring after a while,Burnout 2 is ok. It gets really boring after you played it 20 times. All you do is crash cars and race. Its grafics are ok. There not the best. You should rent it or borrow it from somebody its not worth 20 dollars.
5,...don't be a fool!!,Why keeping your [money] for something else !!! This is it !!!! This is when you can drive wrecklessly !@!!Graphics and everything are so real !!! Buy it and you'll never want to drive the real one !! (^_^)
5,Wait for the NEXT BURNOUT,This is for people that like driving really fast. This game is quite tense because you don't know if your going to crash into a car when you turn that corner. Sometimes you get frustrated by it. People are saying it gets boring but that happens with every great game. When I get a new game I play it(for first 10 days) nearly all day like for 12 hours and thats why I get bored of games like over people. People say it makes you sweat and grin and that's true.
4,Absoloute fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is definetly a must buy.To me, its just plain fun watching and doing the fun crashes!!!!Otherwise,the race mode is great too.I first rented this game seeing what it was like,10minutes into it, it was great.With great graphics and easy handling, this game is great,BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!********"
2,overrated - i'd rather race than watch crashes,"Everybody talks about the crashes in this game, but I found them rather annoying. I'd rather race the freaking race but it seemed like with every little fender bender the game would stop the racing to show you a long drawn out crash. Plus the graphics, to be honest, look like plastic parts on a scale model. The worst part, however, is in the interface. It takes forver to get through about half a dozen useless screens with useless, illegible data (like, who cares?) to get from race to race. Even when the game saves, instead of cutting right to the next screen it stops everything to tell you the obvious (game saved) and you have to x-button your way through that too. The interface is infuriating actually. The game consists mostly of navigating endless interface screens and watching crashes that get really old really quickly, and now and then actually racing. Midnight Club 2 might not be perfect, but it's a lot more fun."
2,Hardly the best Fleming!,"I do not understand why this disc chooses to record the 'remote' Mozart arias, No. 1.Ms. Fleming failed to impress listeners as a Mozartian in this disc, No. 2.A singer of her reputation should be more discerning in her discography.Not that the rarer or earlier Mozart is any less good than Cosi fan tutte or Don Giovanni.But if you have listened to recordings of all Mozart's earlier opera (to which I have), you would be bound to admit that Ms. Fleming did not fare well in those pieces she had chosen here. And even in her Donna Elvira on this disc, she is not in best form.Mozart is not an easy composer to handle. The timbre of Fleming does not sit well in the repertoire chosen here."
1,A misfire...,"I am sorry to say it but this is a Mozartian misfire. Although I enjoyed Renee Fleming's Fiordiligi in her recording with Solti and was very moved by her Donna Anna (again for Solti), this disc brings disappointment. Maybe it was recorded at the time, when the singer was recording too much - she admitted in some TV interview that she worked a lot, what we could have seen from the frequency with which her new releases were flooding the music market. This disc does not bring anything but a healthy dose of fluent singing. Incidentally, her (and Mackerras's) interpretation of Pamina's ""Ach, ich fuehl's"" is simply grotesque!"
3,Good but not for cast iron skillets,"good sturdy spatula for everyday use. looks nice, has a nice feel to it, sure it will last a while. however, I have cast iron frying pans and the edge is not straight enough to remove food particles from the cast iron pan."
3,Can it be raised?,"At first glance, this book takes a simple and almost superficial look at the life of a recently divorced single mother. Nevertheless, it is a book which maintains interest throughout, whether it be through its easy-to-read style or casual humour which is woven through each entry. Betty has recently divorced her husband Mitch, and is forced to contend with a moody boss, the dating scene and most importantly her four year old daughter Molly on an everyday basis. Betty's journal is personal and funny, a highlight being the many lists she uses to help make decisions on the most obscure of topics. A simple and mostly light look at single motherhood, although there are rare moments which will hit where it hurts. A nice easy read which will make you smile."
1,Not happy,"I love the movie MR HOLLAND'S OPUS, and I was wanting one particular son from it. The CD did hao have it. I was sorely disappointed."
1,Misleading Soundtrack,"If you are looking for the original songs from the movie, as I was, you will be very disappointed in this soundtrack. The songs are played by an orchrastra and not the original artist, which is not what was on the movie and I did not recognize the majority of the songs. I had to look at the cover to see what was playing. Cole's song is sung by some other person, it doesn't even sound like the one from the movie. I wasted my money on this."
3,Slightly Satisfying,"I expected much more from the Mr. Holland's Opus Score. While it was enjoyable, I would have preferred a mix of the Soundtrack and the Score. The only song that I could truly appreciate was the last one (Mr. Hollands Opus). If you like classical music, get it, if you just happen to enjoy Mr. Hollands Opus, opt for the Original Soundtrack instead."
3,"Very pretty, but...","Not very comfortable. The sole is hard and only a few millimeters thick. They're definitely not for walking long distances in, but cute though."
5,Great nursing bra for a reasonable price!,"I am starting the ninth month of my pregnancy with our first child. I was large busted prior to getting pregnant and it's been a trial to find a maternity bra or nursing bra that's actually comfortable, but this is it! I would recommend it to any woman, large or small busted."
3,Letters Across the Divide by David Anderson and Brent Zuercher,"This book is what its title indicates. It's a series of letters between a White and a Black man, both Christians, wrestling with differing perspectives on race and racism in America. Their different views come from their different upbringings and subcultures, not theology. In fact, their biblical understanding and the values that develops from it are remarkably similar.What they are trying to do is apply their faith to everyday life. It's a good exercise and they do it well. Whatever your race or ethnic background, you can learn something from this text. It promotes understanding and, therefore, their greater goal, genuine respect and friendship."
4,Learning to cross the divide,"Wonderful read for those that want to know what either the black or white race thinks about the other and about racism. I am a member of a multi-racial church. This book has helped me to understand a little better what I had before perceived as a ""chip on the shoulder"" of some of our black members. I hope it will help me to be more understanding and work harder on my relationships with those members."
5,awesome stuff,"i recommend this product to anyone that suffers from ingrown hairs and razor burn, male or female. this stuff is awesome. it says use it with water to dilute it but if you aren't sensitive, i wouldn't dilute it. it sting's a little after shaving, and if you use it full strength, it stings a lot. but it's very worth it. after a few days of use, you will notice an extreme difference. with everyday use, you will never want to be without it."
4,excellent 4 inch paring knife,no substitute for a sharp high quality paring knife. this 4 inch knife answers the call
5,The one knife I use every day,"After about 10 years using this knife, I recently broke the tip in a coconut accident. I know I was asking a little too much of it but it goes to show the expectations I had for it after so many years of use. I looked around at replacement sets, even much more expensive ones, but ultimately I opted just to replace this knife.It came very sharp, cut myself twice in the first week. I continue to use it every day as it is the most versitile of all my knives. It is particularly useful in fine fruit cuts which I seem to be doing every day for my 2 childen."
3,Paring Knife,Not as good as a five star but still a good knife. Doesn't hold a sharp edge as good as it could.
5,This is a great knife!,"Great knife. .... It's the most used knife in my kitchen. Wonderful all-purpose paring knife. And, it's dishwasher safe. I've had mine for years."
2,over rated,I bought this knife based on its high rating. Sorry to say that I can't stand it. It's not ergonomically correct for my hand and is very uncomfotable for me to use. And the blade actually has very slight knicks in the cutting edge.
5,Excellent quality for the price,"This is a very good knife for the price. It's solid, well made and it balances well in my hand. It keeps an edge and is easily maintained with a steel sharpener."
4,Awesome starting knife,"I am 16 years old working in a 5 star restaurant in colorado, and this is a great knife for cutting small fruits and vegetables! I have found that the handle is a little slick and the blade has a little flex but after a weeks worth of cutting it fits well! Great knife if you don't want something to expensive."
5,Lasts a lifetime,"My mother insisted I buy this EXACT knife because it's the exact same one she got when she was first married 27 years ago. Sure enough, it came and looks and feels exactly the same as the knife I've used for 20+ years when at my parents' house. So I know firsthand that this knife wares amazingly -- my brand new one looks exactly the same as the 27 year-old one. And cuts so well -- the perfect knife for everyday use with meats, veggies, fruits, etc. I'm glad I took the advice to get it. It really is worth the money."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed because I expected to actually learn some technique. Instead it seems to be a long list of the sources of some technique, which is not described in detail. So I am still in a fog about my longevity. Sorry to be negative. Perhaps I can find another more fulfilling book?"
2,It could have been great...,"Even as a person who completely disagrees with book banning and censorship in general, I found this book to be a little heavy-handed. Harper and Gray, admittedly, are great characters, but occasionally they just seem too perfect, especially Gray and his family. Harper's parents and their friends, on the other hand, are simply narrow minded and too obsessive about their religion to pay any attention to anything else- you never get the sense that they could be even vaguely nice. Some of the descriptions are good, the concept is great,and Gray's answering machine messages are very funny and lighten things up a lot, but the flatness of the characters and the obviousness of the plot gives it an overall unrealistic feeling. And as much as I disagree with censorship, I don't need the message thrown in my face so hard."
5,"""Memoirs of a Bookbat"" is definitely worth your while","I have been a long-time fan of Kathryn Lasky, but I have to say that this must be her best book yet. It paints a very realistic picture of a girl whose freedom is oppressed by censorship. I read this book in one day, yet still completely absorbed it and savored it. To anybody who thinks (or does not think, at for that matter)that books should be banned, read ""Memoirs of a Bookbat"". It is a real eye- opener."
2,Disappointing book from a great author,"I'm a major fan of Lasky's and was looking forward to reading this book, which had come highly recommended. It was a big disappointment. Two-dimensional characters; stilted, artificial language; cliché situations; and worst of all, a preachy tone destroyed the message for me. And I'm someone who agrees with her message; I'm strongly against censorship of all sorts. But Harper's path was too clear-cut for her. If one of the people from the so-called ""religious right"" had been the least bit sympathetic, or if Gray had shown some human resentment at being the brunt of her anger, or if one of her parents had tried a little bit to understand her, it would have made her choice much more difficult and painful, and ultimately, more important."
5,"Paul's ""Case""","I read Paul's Case in my sophomore language class this year and ended up writing a paper on it. I love this story and can relate to Paul. Paul is jaded by society, although he posseses the insight to see beauty others can not. He is misunderstood in his affection for the arts, and therefore stereotyped as having a problem. This is a very worthwhile story for any person who wants a thought-provoking look at society."
3,This interpretation of a young adolescents life,This short story combines a extremely classical point of view about a mental unstable boy named Paul. It is a problomatic story. The book appears boring but becomes interesting once you read it.
4,Decent Bio,"The author of this book has a real feel for the Hollywood of the twenties and thirties. There are alot of anecdotes about various silent and talking film stars. I always wanted to know more about Haines. Many bios of stars like Joan Crawford and Carole Lombard mention him, but say little about his career. The gay angle held little interest for me, but there was enough else to keep me interested in the book. William Haines' biography is definitely worth a look for anyone interested in silent film history."
1,Regrettably overstuffed with questionable tales,"I looked forward to reading this book on this famous star of Hollywood in the 20s and 30s but the author's credibility went out the window for me by his constant claims that so many of the stars back then were gay. I am sure many were and of course there is no doubt about Haines but I know for a fact the claim that Claudette Colbert ""came out"" to her friends after her husband's death is completely false. She was straight. Also sincerely doubt Gary Cooper was gay as this writer claims. Unbelievable accusations at other stars makes one wonder just how much truth the author had and just how much ""gossip"" he decided to pass off as truth since all of the parties in question are dead. Nobody is well served by fiction masquerading as nonfiction and Haines himself deserves better than someone sticking a lot of conjecture into a biography of him."
3,An awful lot of conjecture.,"To Mann's credit, he vividly and amusingly captures Hollywoodland during the early part of this century. Unfortunatly (and admittedly), there is a notable lack of available information when it comes to the life of Billy Haines and Mann is forced to spend much of the book filling in the blanks and making huge speculations (most of which probably aren't too far off the mark). A more satisfying approach might have touched on the secret lives of other gay actors during the silent era."
5,"Very readable, insightful, and much-needed book","""George Varghese has had a remarkable impact on the real world of networking with his algorithmic innovations over many years. The networking research and development community is fortunate thathe has now distilled his knowledge in this very readable, insightful, and much-needed book."" -- Yukuen Lai"
