4,Not what I expected ...,"This book wasn't quite what I had expected when I picked it up: an essay on Christianity in the early middle ages on the fringes of Christendom. I was pleasantly surprised nonetheless. The book moves at a good pace, it is historically accurate, and is informative without being dry.The tale of how exactly the Irish saved civilization really revolves around what else was going on in Europe as the last vestiges of the Roman Empire in western Europe crumbled. Cahill does a masterful job of retelling the role Irish monks played in preserving ""knowledge."" His conclusion was especially good. My only bone of contention is Cahill's assertion that it was the Irish who saved civilization - as if the Byzantines and Moslems had nothing to do with the ""preservation"" (let alone the advancement) of ""civilization."" His equation of western Christendom with civilization is a point that I heartily disagree with."
3,"Not a scholarly work, but . . .",Ná lig do na fíricí dea-scéal a mhilleadh.(Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.)
2,"Fun storytelling, bad research","I enjoyed reading the book for it's stories and look at a stretch of history that I was completely unfamiliar with. But from the outset the author blatently showed that supporting his personal theories is more important than providing a balanced look at history. It does make one want to learn what really was going on though.Also, it may just be me, but the author's excitement about latin and greek seem kind of freakish modern literature."
3,Typical Western Attitude,"Cahill reflects the typical view that has plagued historians for centuries. He places too much value on events in Western Europe, while in reality it was in the East that our heritage was secured. The Irish scholars indeed contributed to monastic exercises, but it was in the forgotten Roman (Byzantine) Empire that our culture was preserved. Is it any wonder that directly after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 the first seeds of the Renaissance were born? Likewise it wasn't at Tours that Christendom was saved, but in the existence of the Byzantines. This book is an interesting exercise, but one that is more misleading than enlightening."
2,"starts poorly, doesn't recover","In the first two chapters, I kept wondering, ""so where are the Irish?"", as the author chatted about the Romans, the barbarians, and some Latin poetry, among other off-topic matters. The Irish finally appeared in the third chapter (after maybe a third of the audio book), with some nuggets of historical interest, such as the arrival of the Celts. Even so, the informal style again concentrated on extended excerpts from Irish tales of marginal interest. By the time St. Patrick joined the book, I'd lost interest and had enough.The narrator's presentation was sluggish and not especially appealing, which didn't help a book that certainly wasn't what I expected."
1,An unaccomplished promise,"Despite the fact that the main thesis of this book is plainly on debate, one expects to read about HOW the Irish saved the civilization. Instead of that, we find a lot of BLA BLA. The book obtaines its title from its last 5%. Even if there is NO PRECISCE EXPLANATION about the content of the book. The question as follows: you cannot decide whether the thesis is false or true, simply because the book is about anything but the title."
3,Fast read with interesting slant on the topic,"I am apparently one of the great (historically) unwashed who never took a course in world history, not even in high school. So for me this book filled in a lot of missing pieces of how western civilization got from the Roman empire days to the Medieval days. It was entertaining and gave me a feeling for how things were during and after the Roman empire and what actually happened in and to Ireland. The title's claim was supported by the text though not as strongly as I expected. The book clarified for me some of the origins of the Catholic church which I found quite enlightening. As a historical non-schollar, I can only hope that the facts are accurate. I happened to listen to the book on audio tape while on a long drive so I don't know if there are many references to historical research in the printed version. Still, it made me want to find out more about this topic. Isn't that what popularized versions of history are supposed to do?"
5,Wonderful story,"Wonderful story. Loved the example of moralism set by the monk. So real, not phoney."
1,Has some real facts but is biased,"I have done research into this topic and have found that Cahill did supply the reader with some real facts. Unfortunately, he also came from a biased christian standpoint. Cahill made the celtic pagan Irish seem that they were a lower level of people in thier religion and that they needed to be ""saved"" by the new religion of christianity. He also goes on to say that they desired this saving in their subconscious mind. Of course, there is no evidence to support this statement. For someone trying to get a pure historical factual based recount of Irish history, this is not it."
2,"Interesting, but biased, perspective on Irish civilization","Cahill writes an entertaining overview of Irish contributions to European culture. His style is often narrative and easy to read, but he only gives perfunctory attention to the facts. Also, he seems to have forgotten that Europe, including Ireland, got the great classic works from the Eastern Mediterranean civilizations. The occasional bigoted statements about different religious faiths are irrelevant and unfortunate. Cahill seems to be overly prejudiced to anything and everything Irish; the Romans are depicted negatively in pre-Christian Ireland, then the English Protestants are evil ones in a Catholicized Ireland.Overall, this book suffices as light reading, but is mediocre in its scholarship."
2,Really?,"Let me start by saying that I read this book with the intent to ridicule it. Since I am not born on the pristine Western Hemisphere, I find the title to be a preposterous claim at best. Obviously this book was written as a 'feel good book' for the Irish descendents in America. However, instead of a true portrayal of the valuable achievements of the Irish monks, the writer set off on a much worthier mission, lets save civilization itself. This book is written with, dare I say, a Euro-centric mindset. There is a lot of good material in this book that could have been better served had it not been dealt out by such extravagent claims."
1,Good Try,"Mr. Cahill is an entertaining writer but he appears all too blatantly biased with his material. The Irish did not single handedly save civilization anymore than did Christianity destroy it, although it is largely the Christian bias that he suffers from. At the end of the book he says: ""---if we are to be saved, it will not be by Romans but by saints."" If it were not for the Romans there would not have been any civilization for the Irish to save in the first place. Mr. Cahill as well treats his idea as though it were unknown before him, when any student of European history is quite well aware of the contributions of the monastery system of the British Isles in helping to reorganize the west. As Cahill is an Irish name I wonder that anyone should be surprised by his views."
1,Still Laughing! What A Sham!,"The last reviewer was right. There is nothing good in this SLOP!!! Who does the author think he is? Does he think that Americans are MORONS? The Roman world was being preserved by a huge host of peoples, {notably by ROMANS} as was pointed out by the more LITERATE 1 star reviewers. I suggest those who gave this more than one star should do their own research. THEN THEY SHOULD RETURN THIS SHAM BACK FOR A REFUND, OR USE IT FOR KINDLING!"
1,OFFENSIVE!,"I agree with those reviewers who want to boycott the ignorance, lies, and absurd incoherence of this shockingly BAD BEST SELLER. Sadly, we are a decade too late. The 45 million Irish-Americans bought this junk by the truck load. My friend in the Hibernians asked my opinion of this book since his club members were asked to buy it{PROOF OF MY SUSPISCIONS}. To my surprise he agreed with me that it was bigoted sewage. The author took barely 30 pages mentioning the actual topic. He failed in every way, except in offending my ""Spanish-Jewish roots!"" I also just wrote a rev. for His Gifts Of The Jews. It was not as offensive as this, but the author is an amateurish hack. Skip both."
1,NO DETAILS AND BIGOTRY!,"The negative reviewers are all correct, this is a horrid book. Where are the DETAILS? The author never answered several key questions. Where did the Irish get their books? How long did their handful of monasteries last? If their church was so pure and superior as the author claims. Why did all of the Europeans adopt the more organized ROMAN CHURCH? He also bashed Hispanics, Chinese, Germans, Mormons, and the very Greco-Roman Civilization that he wants the reader to believe was saved by a handful of monks. This gets 10 NEGATIVE STARS, the publisher should be sued for printing this junk!!!!!"
1,GERMANOPHOBIA!,"As others have pointed out this is bad PROPAGANDA!!!!! ""Contrary to the authors laughable premise most of the Germans were very ROMANIZED! Their kings allied with Rome to stop the Huns at Chalons in June 451. They did so because THEY VALUED THE CULTURE THAT ROME HAD BUILT!"" This book is filled with gross exaggerations, false facts, and the most bias research I have ever read. DON'T FALL FOR THIS SHANTY SLOP! I agree 1 million percent with the last reviewer. Bigotry should not be published."
1,Usual fawning nonsense from the US over things Irish,I thought the book was pretty awful. The content could have usefully have been boiled down to 1 chapter. Why do Americans suspend their commonsense when someone raves on about the Irish? The reality is that the state of civilisation there was even more backward than the rest of Europe during all this time. Some of the old books and learning was preserved there but this was a few monks. Nothing mentioned about the real heroes of the dark ages regarding the subject of preserving the wisdom of the past - the Arabs!
1,"This isn't history, it's PROPAGANDA.","And BAD propaganda, to boot.A friend handed me this book, telling me how great it was. The title alone made me suspect heavily what it would really be about. I began reading it, just in case my first impression was wrong... and it WASN'T.The author states an awful lot of half-truths and distorted information - I think that he doesn't name sources just to cover his lies (sorry if it sounds harsh, but that's what I've been taught half-truths are). I've read propaganda books WAY better done than this one.I think that only two groups of people will fall for this book: 1) people who have NO general knowledge of the Middle Ages. 2) people whose nationalistic pride obscures their skepticism and/or reasoning (let me be clear on this: nationalistic pride is good, but not without a limit).In my opinion, this book is not worth the money it costs: as a history book, it's completely worthless; as a propaganda book, is mediocre."
2,Waste of money.,"This book is a terrible book for a beginning backgammon player to pick-up. Although, the introduction regarding the history of backgammon is quite intersting, the instructions concerning opening moves is ridiculous. It's no wonder the author is credited with the first system of teaching backgammon--it's an awful system."
2,review,Item said like new but the case was all sticky. Not sure if something got on it ie soda or it was from stickers but I would not call something like that new. I realize there should be some wear in tear but calling like new just made me kind of disappointed by the it being like that.
4,This is music for lovers or people in LOVE.,"The Softones has a smooth pleasing sound that the more mature music lovers like. If you like to sing, you can sing along. Although it will be difficult to match the sound of lead singer Marvin, you can fool youself."
4,The Softones,"This is a great CD; however, it is missing one very popular song and that is ""Carla My Love."" I have not been able to find that recording anywhere and I thought for sure that it would be included in this particular CD."
1,Stay Away from this Item,"This is a horrible product. While it does what it promises to do, namely grind down your nails to shape them, it is magnificently uncomfortable. If you use it for even less than one second, even in that short amount of time, the grinder overheats and it gets extremely hot. Extremely. Because of the pausing you'll have to do, using this for your nails would take more time than to just use an emory board."
1,Works great if you tape your iPOD to the antenna,I bought this at Best Buy for ~$50 for an iPOD Video expecting the same performance I got out of the iTrip that plugs into the headset jack. I tested it in the house on the home stereo. It worked great while the transmitter was <1 foot away from the FM antenna. At 2 feet there was noticeable static. Anything over 4 feet away was ALL static. When I returned it to the store the salesman said they had only been selling them for a week and had already gotten almost all of them back on returns for the same problem.Summary: Terrible product!
3,Smothering your speakers with a pillow,"I just started using my iPod nano and iTrip. The only original comment I have to add is do not expect ""brilliant"" sound. The sound coming out of your radio will sound as if your speakers are being muffled... as if you are listening to an old monophone radio. The better your equilizer on your radio, the better you can compensate for the muffled output from the low power broadcast. If sound quality is important to you, you will be better off using a direct connection through a input jack. I am happy to say I have no reception problems. Reception was clean with no static for at least 20 feet of a clear line of site."
4,Great Concept - Not the Greatest Reception,"the iTunes works for me, but I have to have it in a certain spot in my car in order to get the least amount of static. That spot just so happens to be the floorboard of my backseat. other than that, it works pretty much as expected. as long as you have some nice playlists and don't need to mess with it much, you'll be fine with this product."
2,"MITO wins, NOT this one","July 2006. After testing the Jwin, Griffen 30BK, Edge DiskGO, and the Kensington Pico, and the MITO, the MITO wins hands down. The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close. My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation. In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep. Go with the MITO, you won't be sorry."
4,"Read the reviews, but don't be afraid to give something a chance.","Whoever said it depends on the car and the radio was right on the money. I tried a lot of different FM transmitters. All of witch plugged into the cars power and all of witch got pretty good ratings. Then I tried this on, that didn't get very goon ratings. I don't know if this will be of any help to anyone else but I found that most of the interference that I was getting was not overlapping radio stations, it was engine noise.Using a module that is completely separate from the cars electrical system made all the difference in the world.This deserves a second look and more that 2 stars. My advice is find a store with a good return policy (like Amazon) open the packages carefully and see what works for you. This one works perfect for me and my 98 Toyota with a sony after-market radio."
1,Poor Choice,Very disappointing product. Produces very poor quality music transmission even when placed in contract with the radio.
2,Good device for in-city driving,"When this device works, your iPod sounds almost as good as a radio station coming through your stereo head in your car. An iTrip is great, if you are driving in one city where you know where the 'dead air' is and can pretty much leave your iTrip tuned to one or more channels.I'd also suggest you find the location in the car where the iPod works well and leave the iPod there. Moving the iPod around causes annoying static and feedback.If you're going on the road, you're going to spend a lot of time going through the channels to find dead channels to play your iPod through. Plus, high power lines and truckers interfere with your transmission. On a 200-mile trip, we had to change the channel for the iPod to play more than 5 times and there were some spots where the static was so bad, we couldn't get reception at all.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
3,Meh bettter then nothing....,Static static static........Yes its true u have to turn the volume up a GREAT amount for u to even hear the sound as for Blazing down the highway with your widows down while listing to your ipod is just out of the question with this device.I belive this item is weather affected Works ok during the day but on cold days its 3 times harder to get a reception with it.
2,Minimal range and does not work many many ipod cases.,"I bought this for my 80 GB Ipod (5.5 Generation) video. The first thing I noticed is that it will not fit many Ipod cases...there is not much clearance between it and the Ipod. If you use a case on your ipod, it needs to be very thin or easily removable for this product. The next thing I noticed was that the range was minimal. It did not work well in some parts of my car. And the last thing I noticed was that it is very directional. I got different performance base on the direction that I pointed it.I gave it two stars because it is compact and somewhat stylish. And while the range is minimal, it does work."
1,Not worth the money,"I just returned mine because for the money, I expect better quality. I thought it would at least match the FM transmitter that is built into my husbands XM radio and it comes nowhere close. It just isn't powerful enough to sound good. I'm looking for something better. One plus, it looked really good with my black video ipod."
1,Griffin Itrip FM transmitter is POOR,"The Griffin FM transmitter works so poorly that is not worth buying.Prior to buying it, I bought the Kennsington FM transmitter. It works very well and wanted another one for our other car. The Kennsington model I had was discontinued, so I bought the Griffin. BIG MISTAKE. There is so much static with the Griffin FM transmitter, that it's not worth having and you are better off listening to the radio. Save your money!"
4,Works Well,"This product works pretty well. The first couple of stations I tried were not coming in very clearly, so I tried one on the other end of the dial and that seemed to work much better. The sound isn't great, but it is acceptable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive and functional iTrip."
4,Easy But Not Perfect,"This transmitter is easy to use and works well in most circumstances. In my wife's car it's great, listening to my iPod on my boom-box it's great, but listening to my iPod in my car, it's only fair with too many instances of static beaking through the music to make it useable. It's probably got more to do with my car than the transmitter. I have had several devices and this one is the easiest to use. It's particularly good because it doesn't require any batteries."
2,Griffin Itrip,I returned this product because it would play for about 20 seconds and then break into static. Not sure why?
4,Great transmitter,"Just bought this product... works great in my stereo, also works great in my car... Excelent Buy..."
1,Barely usable for podcasts,"The transmitter power is very weak. In an urban environment like the LA area, you are unlikely to find an empty frequency that works well. I positioned the ipod 2 feet away from the antenna and used mono which doubles the power. But sound quality was still comparable to a AM radio which cuts out with static every 30 seconds while driving. Maybe can be used for playing podcasts but I would recommended trying another method."
1,I-TRIP... i will make the trip back to the store.,"this is an awful product. i purchased it less than one hour ago and i'm going to return it. its very hard to find a station that will play well. on my home stereo it plays fair, but they have something for that already which is at least 20 dollars cheaper. do not buy this unless you live in an area with very few FM stations. yeah. then go ahead buy it. if you live in LA or any other highly populated area with a million radio stations skip it. those four star reviews.. perhaps u live in a desert. but for city folk... this is a waste of money."
3,Ok,The FM Transmitter is ok. It works for the most part but it is hard to work as the driver. I much prefer the FM transmitter for the 20GB ipod.
5,I-trip,The i-trip I purchased was exactly what I ordered and worked fine. I would definitely order from this company again.
3,Griffin FM transmitter review,"I like this product. Most of all I love having the ability to take my iPod into the car with me & enjoy my music. On occasion, the signal is weak & it gets staticy but other than that, it works fine"
1,Ipod Tuner,Don't waste your money on this one. You can't use it without other FM stations bleeding thru.
1,what i think review,"i say this brand and product is garbage i had this but white it sucked i had it before i got a car that had a alpine head unit with ipod interface first when the fm transmitter i hardley got any reception i had to have it really close to a factory head unit would say belkin has the best fm transmitter besides geting a ipod interface for ether factory or aftermarket which i think is best the best three brands for after market head unites are alpine,pioneer,and kenwood if wanting to have a ipod for the factory check out [...] they make products for factory radios but just fm transmitter i would belkin is best"
3,Ok Item,I had ordered a iPod Classic Case along with this FM Transmitter and I thought this transmitter would fit the iPod when inside the case. But No! you need to remove the case each time you want to use this. There will be no contact with iPod when the Ipod is inside the case.
4,"Great Device, as is",This attachement has great transmission power for it's size; since it does not rely on the ipod volume level (takes line level signal from the dock connector) it doesn't drain your ipod battery as other transmitters that use the headphones output (just be sure to turn the ipod volume all the way down otherwise it would output power to the headphones and even thoug there's nothing connected the internal amp is still working). For the price I paid the device really delivers....even more than some models that have attached the car dc-plug and theorically should have more power....The only thing I would change is instead of having a mini USB on the bottom I'd change it to an ipod connector (I guess it's due to its size)
5,Great transmitter,Several manufacturers of this type of transmitter were purchased in my quest to find the best overall model. By far the Griffin is one of the best on the market.
2,Low Quality Sound - Cheap Product,"I bought this unit about 2 months ago and it worked 'OK' for about 3 or 4 weeks. It is extemely low powered and in most cases I had to keep it in the cup holder so it was close enough to the radio. The audio quality is pretty bad as well, this may be due to the limited power but basically I had to turn your radio up to full volume for most songs encoded at 192.In addition, I had to plug it into the bottom of the ipod repeatedly to get it to work at all. This got worse over time. I believe the jack (male) part of the itrip was not designed to the correct tolerance and over time the connection to the ipod jack continued to fail.One last item, the only reason I went with this unit was because my car has the lighter mounted behind the steering wheel, so the cradle unit does not fit. I will be staying away from griffin though, hopefully there is an alternative."
5,tito 'review,"recibi el equipo bien y sin problema , el unico detalle es que se tardo mucho en llegar, expecificamente se tardaron mucho en enviarlos, pero los recivi sin problemas y funcionando bien"
3,"Not bad, but not good either","It does what its supposed to do, but performance is subpar. The frequency isnt strong so static is always present, sometimes a bit too much. It also picks up the sirius satellite feed so at times I'll be listening to my ipod and get rudely interrupted by howard stern. I also find I have to put the volume up very high on both my ipod and car stereo. It also drains the battery much quicker. I own the phillips tape deck adapter and I get a much crisper sound and the battery doenst die out so quickly. Therefore I only use the Itrip when I'm in a car that doesnt have a tape deck. Performance is not bad, but it aint good either. Thank God I purchased mine through amazon for under $30. I would have hated to pay more for this."
1,Bad connection!,"I bought this product for my Nano 2nd. gen. and I was really dissapointed because I have to hold it against my radio while I drive around downtown because if not all you can hear is static. If you move it away from the radio 5 inches to change the song, the static is pretty obvious eventhough the you are not driving around downtown. I won't buy it again."
1,Piesce of s%*#,don't buy fm modulators are ok if they are powered but the self powered units are so bad that i had it sitting on top of my antenna and it still sounded hollow and faraway use a tape adapter or just burn a cd
2,Nothing special,I have tried it and was not impressed by it at all. The quality of sound is OK when you can find a free bandwidth. However in very crowded areas like mine that's a continuous challenge.
2,"Not bad, not very good either","No matter what station I used, blank or occupied, I got some static; and in loud parts of the song, the sound shorted out, even though it doesn't output sound very loud at all."
1,Horrible static in car and home radio,BAD static unless the unit is right next to the radio and there is a loud sound between each song. The static was so bad on instrumental songs I just didn't bother. I gave it to my teenager who plays hard core rock so he doesn't hear the static. In my opinion this was a waste of money.
1,Think twice,"I think my expectations about this product were pretty reasonable when I was shopping for it. I wanted to listen to the music trough my car stereo in STEREO and I expected sound quality as good as any FM station from the area. Not necessarily CD sound quality, Stereo FM quality is fine for me. I'm very disappointed. I tried it on my car stereo, my friend's car stereo, my home stereo, changed stations many times, changed the settings LX/DX again and again. No use. The sound quality is terrible. The static drove me crazy. I don't think taping it to the antenna will do any good. I'll return it tomorrow, take another reviewer's advice and buy a cassette adapter."
2,Transmitter Review,"The product is very good. The only issue I found is when the Ipod is using a leather case, the transmitter doesn't do an efficient connection with the Ipod, so sometimes the car stereo misses signal."
3,Some Static,"The device works fairly well, for listening to my old time radio programs on the evening drive home. However, the programs drift in and out and there is some static that is very annoying."
1,Sound quality is a appalling.,"I was shocked and sent this thing back immediately. My old and cheap and ugly CASSETTE ADAPTOR sounds like *hi-fi* compared to that. Sorry, but I expected more ..."
2,Doesnt quite solve the problem but ok in a limited sence,"MAybe this product would work better in an area with fewer radio stations. When I travel close to home I can easily find a station to tune this product to. However when I want to go loger distances I have to keep retuning it to different stations. great idea, just not quite the answer to my ipod listening needs!"
1,Way too much static!,"Got this unit one day and returned the next. Lots of static in car application, no matter which channel was used."
1,Worst Thing,"This is the worst purchase in my life, the product is very cool, pretty, good shape but that is all, bad quality, bad signal, I will put in the trash can and burn the can."
4,worth the invesment,"After an extensive search i got the Griffin thechnology I trip FM transmitter ,and i am glad i didIt is nicely fitting into my Ipod video, good sound, easy to use, versatile,as you can use it with any FM radio or stereo in your car or your boat. no cords or extra connectios, no need for batteries it works over 4 hrs in fully charged Ipod ."
2,"Cheap, you get what you pay for","I wanted to listen to the music on my iPod and my car didn't have a direct line in, and I didn't want to burn a bunch of CDs, this looked like a good deal at the time, but it ended up not being one. It's really hard to find a station in which you get a decent signal, and oftentimes, you have to wave the iPod around before you can actually have it pick it up. All in all, it ends up being pretty staticky and you just get fed up listening to it."
1,Worst of the bunch,"I have bought four brands of wireless transmitter for my iPod (from BestBuy, 'cause it's easy to return them there) and this is definitely the worst.Still have not found one that I really like but the best so far seems to be the TuneStik by DLO.But really, the only way to listen through your FM in the car is hard-wired (if your unit has that jack)."
4,Pretty darn good,"I am fairly impressed with the iTrip...especially since i had heard a lot of bad things about the early generation. But a friend of mine had just purchased one and loved it so I thought i would give it a shot. I liked the idea of it being chordless. The invasion of static is rare, however when the iTrip gets cold it plays with quite a lot of static until it warms up to about room temp. It took me a while to figure that out. Not sure why that is the case but i just stick it infront of my heating vent in the car for a few seconds and it goes away. Otherwise I am very happy with it!"
2,WEAK,"This thing has very weak signal, and feels like it could break with minimal force, treat it with kid gloves. And if you have this on a station in common use by other FM transmitters, be prepared to have the signal taken over by passing cars. I also have the charger version, and it too suffers from weak signal, and must be plugged into a power source to work. Both have terrible volume, and the ipod/radio must be maxed out to get any kind of enjoyment. I would not recommend either if you have the time to wait for a better version, or update that will increase the volume output of the ipod itself."
1,Absolutely useless,"In its defense, I must say that I still havent found a good FM transmitter for iPods, and this one is no exception.It's terrible. The reception on your car's radio to the signal this transmitter sends will be scratchy. And even when you do manage to place it so you get okay reception, the quality of the audio will be terrible.There is simply no comparison to using a tape to feed your iPod signal (or perhaps rewiring your car to accept an auxillary input)."
4,Performs as expected...,"I didn't expect the iTrip to be perfect, and it isn't, but it does deliver a nice quality of music through your car sterio. I thought the iTrip would drain the battery on my iPod, but it really doesn't, which is nice for those longer car rides. All in all, it is a pretty good product."
1,Expected better,This thing was a huge disappointment. I am so glad I was able to return it where I bought it and not get hassled. I was expecting it to be an improvement over my cassette adapter in my car. Not even close. I was only able to get it to work on one frequency and it sounded awful. If I had the money I would buy a car stereo that had an input for an i-pod and that would probably sound best. Save your money and avoid this one. I was woefully disappointed. For the huge price I would have expected something much better.
1,"Will break, Do not Buy.","When you plug it in to your ipod, you will notice that it is wobbly and very loose. Horrible product design on their part for that.But while you use it, it will work fine besides that.After about 2 months, mine stopped transmitting.Overall, this is a bad product. Do not buy."
5,Serves its purpose well. Great transmitter.,Love this transmitter. Allows me to hookup my IPOD at work or on the beach or anywhere I go. Also allows me to hook into an electrical adaptor. Couldn't be without it.
4,Good for the road...,I listen to my ipod everyday commuting to work and home. The transmitter actually works really well but it does have some fuzz once in awhile but it's just the location I'm in. I bought one for myself a few months ago and just bought another one recently for a friend. I would reccommend this product.
4,Good product for the price,"This is a good product for the price.Pros -1. price2. color availability3. ease of usecons -1. a very low static thats audible only if heard carefully2. transmission is not very powerful. sometimes your car radio station just gets taken over by some other car besides you having powerful transmitter.Overall its a great product, it takes away lot of wiring mess, and adds lot of flexibility. Eventually good return on iPod investment."
4,Very good but no excelent !!,If the iTrip much away from the radio the signal lost and no good sound
2,Poor sound quality,"Very easy to use, BUT the sound quality is so bad that I can't listen to anything louder than Easy Listening. I wish I had my old FM transmitter back."
4,It has become the remote control for music in the car,"I bought the iTrip as a gift for my wife. I thought it would deliver very good quality when using it for the car radio, but it was not HiFi. My wife did not even try using it. One day our 2 year old girl was insistent in listening to one song we did not have in the car, so my wife used the iTrip+iPod to play that toddler song. Since then the iTrip+iPod has become the remote control of toddler music and stories in the car."
1,Do not buy for International use,"I bought this product in the US and tested it in a car there.It work not bad, but now I am home in Europe and when trying it in the house or the car radio it just cannot find any channel where the sound will be worth...the ""Itrip"" is just good for the trash!!!Don't buy this product unless you can really test it first in your country radio FM channels!"
1,dont waste your time,"integrates nicely with ipod unit, but doesnt work. sound quality is very poor. cant listen to static. dont waste your time or money with this unit."
1,Christmas Gift For Mom,"Griffin 9781-TRP30BK iTrip FM Transmitter with Dock Connector for iPod (Black)The product was difficult to work with and weeks from Christmas, my mom is still trying to get it to work. Some signal is picked up, but not enough to make this product worthwhile. Because the product is not from Amazon, you cannot return it, which makes for a frustrated customer when he/she finds that the product is shotty to say the least."
1,War stories about scriptwriting instead of technique,"Sangster is an old pro. He's framed three scripts with brief, very general comments about writing, and interesting war stories. If you want war stories, his other books are probably a better bet. If you want writing technique, seek it somewhere else."
4,"Great Bow, wrong parts.",This Bow Is a Very Good Bow For Target shooting. I would strongly recomend it for Target shooting and not for Hunting. But! When I received The Bow The Limbs Were backwards! Everything else was great exept for the limbs of this Bow. The reason I give This Bow a 4 star is because Its a great Bow when you get the right peices. I still suggest this bow.
1,Never even had a chance.....,"I ordered my bow on April 23 and anxiously awaited it's arrival. After 2 weeks I started to get ancy and contacted seller via e-mail. 3 e-mails later, no response and past the last day of the estimated delivery date (May 12) I contacted seller by phone. After waiting on hold for 18 minutes while seller contacted precision shooting equipment I was told that my bow was back ordered and would be ANOTHER month. I asked why in the world didn't they notify me OR respond to one of my three e-mails. The seller didn't have any answers nor particularly cared and I cancelled my order. I just ordered another bow from WTA - it will be here tomorrow. Now THAT's service. Sheesh."
4,Half-hearted Cynicism,"As a lazy philosopher in search of a belief system, I found this book exceptionally provocative, if occaisionally irritating. I'm generally not a fan of compilations, particularly when many of the pieces are unfinished manuscripts. However, it was wonderful to see so many of my own half-formed questions given an eloquent voice. The beauty of these writings is that though Twain/Clemmens pokes fun at or denounces the futility of the human struggle and our attempts to understand, he never gives in to his own dark thoughts. Throughout it all there is an undercurrent of hope. Contradictory, yes, but well worth look."
3,Dell Axim x50,The machine was average. The power fitting to the machine was loose and so active sinc was not smooth. Other items such as battery longevity make the machine less than what I was hoping for.
2,Unhappy,"What I wanted was a PDA that would enable me to access the internet and download the needed software. Unfortuately, I can not do either as the internet card does not work that accommpanied the PDA and I can not download anything unto to drive as its error message is stating that it does not have enough space. Therefore, the two basic reason for purchasing the PDA is not being fulfilled."
2,Missing in Action,"When the Dell Axim arrived as a refurbished, it was missing the software CD necessary to use it, as well as the correct battery charger and sync cable. It took a lot of work to get enough information to get started. Getting the correct versions of Microsoft Mobile PC, and ActiveSync has really taken the fun out of this purchase. The WiFi capabilities were overstated by Dell, and as yet have not been successful."
4,Good out of box performer,"This is my third video camera. I have previously owned VHS-C cameras that perfomed well. I needed the Nightshot feature for the investigations I do. The first time out, knowing general camera operation, I found this camera very easy to use. The flip out viewer is very sharp and the sound playback is good for instant review of videos. The compact size makes it easy to handle. I have yet to use all features, but I am confident that they will be satisfactory also. If you need a video feed to a computer, you'll need a capture device or get one of the digitals that have the USB/Firewire hookups. Basically, it seems to be a durable easy to operate camera."
5,Perfect choice for something easy to use,"After toying with the idead of getting a camcorder, I recently bought this Sony camcorder about a week ago. Out of all the ones I've researched this one seemed to be the easiest to use. I've never used a camcorder before and I was able to use this without looking through the manual. Every feature on the camcorder is clear as day to use. If you are just looking for something simply to use that has features that ANYONE can operate, this is the camera for you."
5,This Camera rocks!!,"this camera is perfect for having fun!! it has all the features i could ever need! it is very easy to use, and easy to figure out, i didnt even need the instructions! i recommend this to anyone who needs a perfect camera!!"
4,Good camera - easy to use,We had never used a mini-camcorder before and had no problems with this camera. It has all the features we need !!
5,Great Buy,I purchased this item to copy my old tapes to digital technology.This camera is superior to my old sony and is so small and convenient to use that I will continue to use it for projects that do not need the new Digital resolution.
1,No Manual White Balance,"This Camcorder is useless. Has alot of extras but when working on a video for my AV class I when to set up the white balance and found that it's auto. When compared to one with manual WB this camera sucks. Pictures are all different colors from blue to yellow. Manual WB is a basic standard on all camera and camcorder so why was it left off this one? I would give or suggest this camcorder to any one, I'd look for another, just in case you plan on editing your color don't change from shot to shot. This is a worthless camcorder."
3,Sony customer,Amazon recently raised the price on this camcorder as well as the Samsung SCL906. Each was raised approx.10.00 Shop around.
4,Good Substitute,"Although they aren't that great in the calorie department compared to other full fat brands, they are a tasty alternative if you are counting fat grams."
1,By Far The Worst Product I Have Used,I have read that they have changed the formula for the worst and my first hand experience with this product proves that this is the case. I used it once and will probably give it away. Just awful!
2,Disappointed!,"There's been a formula change in the Omega shaving cream. It no longer contains menthol, and it appears that the amount of eucalyptus oil has been decreased. Not nearly as soothing as the old stuff! I would suggest buying the Proraso - about the same price and plenty of menthol."
3,VICKS!!!!,"Vicks Vapor RubYup - this stuff smells like Vicks Vapor Rub....in the tub. However, when you put it on it your face...... doesn't smell much like anything. There is menthol in this product but you barely feel any tingle. I gave this product 3 stars because the lather you get from this stuff is incredible. I mean you will love how much lather you get from just a little bit of product. THIS IS NOT PRORASO! Don't even go there - Omega is made in Italy but that is the ONLY similarity. PRORASO will give you tingle, fresh, smooth, lather with a wonderful aroma. Omega will just give you lather - that's it. Again I got suckered by all of the great reviews and reviewers comparisons to Proraso.PROS:Lathers up wellPriceCONS:Bad aroma - Vicks"
3,Very good soap,I reviewed this soap shortly after buying it a year or so ago. I was hasty. I have since found it so much better than any other soap or gel or cream I have tried. I am now ordering my second bowl. I hope I didn't turn anybody off first time around as this is give a great shave.
5,No complaints here.,"Bought this as a test. I wanted to see if it measured up to Proraso (C.O Bigelow's) Shaving Soap in Cup. It did. This is good stuff. Just make sure you whip it up into a real good lather, and you should get an exceptionally smooth shave."
2,Not Proraso. Not very good.,"A lot of reviewers are claiming that this is the same as Proraso. It is not.This has a softer texture and color, and the smell reminds me more of Vicks VapoRub.It is however similar enough that if you like Proraso you will probably like this one too.UPDATE: After a few uses, this turns into a slimy goo, and it doesn't last very long either.Not a good value. Apparently this used to be the same as Proraso, but they changed the formula."
1,What you get in the mail is not what's advertised here,"I ordered this soap in 2011, liked it and ordered again recently. What I got the second time is a completely different product. It's not a soap - more like a goo/paste. The list of ingredients is different from the original too. The only things that still match what's being advertised on amazon are the name and manufacturer.Be warned - stay away from Omega!"
2,easy but not as comfortable,"I picked this up for my first experience using a safety razor thinking it'd be the easiest way to get going. It kind of is, but I hit two issues with it.First, it goes on cold. It's sitting in my bathroom in the basement and it's already a cream type substance so you don't add as much water to it. This causes it to really be a cold cream when it goes on more.Second, I had a hard time getting water into it to build up the wet part of the wet shave. I thought things were good, but then i tried out using a william's mug shaving soap and it went on so much better and felt a ton better.So this is pretty easy to get going, comes in a container, etc, but I don't think it's going to give you the best experience shaving you can get."
5,Good shave soap.,I think this is the same or similar soap as Poraso. Soap lathers quickly with a moisturizing light methol effect.
1,Do Not Buy,"This stuff was non-functional, odd smelling, and more expensive than Gillette shaving gel (which I personally find totally satisfactory).Do not waste money on this crap. Just buy something half-decent from a store that does not come already opened."
3,Not the same,"I had ordered this same product over a year ago and needed a new stock of it. They have changed this soap, it is now like a paste and not a hard soap in a bowl like my previous purchase. May have to order a different shaving soap but I'll try this one first to see if it gives the same lather/shave as the previous bowl."
1,Wanted to like it,"I wanted to like this product. I only started wet shaving this year, and my only products before this one were proraso, which maybe set too high a standard, but I needed to at least check into cheaper alternatives; This is the first of the possibilities I've tried out. I thought at first that I was having a batch of bad blades somehow, after some time, I realized 1/2 of my razor burn/irritation problems were my skin having a reation to this soap. While it felt fine going on, I started to get irritation feeling with each pass... thought that I maybe should rework it a little thicker & applied a little more. It was soon very clear that my skin was starting to burn from the soap... though I hadn't any reaction to it before starting to shave. I had to quickly rinse it off & slathering proraso soothed everything quickly."
2,"Not as advertised, doesn't last long","Like others have pointed out, the product that is shipping in 2012 is not the same as the that which shipper earlier. The product is much softer, absorbs water in the bowl (an issue if you shave in the shower), and becomes more like a goop. It still gives a decent shave, but it does not last as long as its quantity suggests."
1,"Does not work on newer operating systems, company does not care","This does not work on newer operating systems such as Windows Vista. The company does not care.They do not help at all. They offer you a different title, but give no assistance in findingan appropriate title that might work with your operating system (basically, they've updated noneof their stuff it seems and do not care). They e-mail you back every 7 days and that is about it.It's horrible. Why would they have software that only works on old systems? Pretty useless.Stick to scholastic software."
1,Average,"I enjoy this CD, but not been a classical fan I found it a little subdue if that has a meaning in this classical music."
5,"Invicta women's watch, great buy","Frankly this watch looks better than I thought it would, love it. I'm thinking of buying another for myself. In a couple months time I will know how it ""stands"" my wife's ""use and abuse"" (eventhough I think it will ""surpass the use test"")."
3,Smaller face for dial,A nice watch but too small of a face. Plan on returning it and getting a bigger faced Invicta chronograph watch.
3,Music Makers is all one track,"A good performance but the Music Makers track is all one long CD track, making it difficult to play sections of it for rehearsal purposes.The chorus is placed somewhat in the ""back"" of the sound, so parts of the score are almost inaudible, of course Elgar meant for them to be pppp, but you're not going to be able to listen to this in your car :-)Musically a faithful performance of a work that should be getting performed more."
2,Forget about all but the first two tunes.,"Open a Tequiza, sit down, relax, close your eyes and listen again and again to White Bird and Hot Summer Day. Now don't you wish to hell this dude was still doing his thing !"
4,Wonderful integration of a violin into a rock/jazz music,"Starting with one of my ALL-time favorite bluesy tunes.....""Hot Summer Day"", this CD dances beautifully through a wide diversity of rock violin tunes which is magically held together by masculine well defined vocals. This is a rare treat amongst the massive amounts of available music."
2,Plucked From The Depths Of The Cut-Out Bin,"Once upon a time I picked up a demo LP of Inside Out. Thankfully, I only dropped $2 on it at the time. I thought there might be a trace of the magic of IABD. WRONG!Much of it sounded like a mix of Pablo Cruise and Ambrosia. It still does 30 years later. The only track worth listening to is Somewhere Down The Road which sounds like an outtake from Tumbleweed Connection complete with Elton John piano licks. Come on, Reg, you've fessed up to much worse atrocities than guesting on this album.Now paired with the ultra lame White Bird LP on one CD, you have the chance to waste 71:46 of your life without having to turn a record over. I call that progress of sorts.Slip this baby on when it's time for guests to leave and you don't want to be TOOOOOOOOO obvious."
5,Great book!,This book gives step by step instruction on how to buy and flip real estate and covers a lot of ground. It's very straight forward and easy to understand and I found it very helpful as I was starting my business. I would definitely recomend this book as a good starting point for real estate investors.
4,Melatonin works to help sleep,"I've found Melatonin to work quite well for mild sleeping problems. It's not a ""knockout"" pill, so expect it to work subtly."
4,Planning trip to Island,Great Coffee table book. It gives a great pictorial view of the island. I would have like a few more details--but in fairness that is not the purpose of the book. Could not find one that did both so I purchased a small travel guide as a companion.
5,A must for your cd collection!,"What can you say about this? Put simply it's a collection of some of the best ballads ever! From the mega hits like 'It must have been love' to the lesser known hits of 'Milk & toast & honey' Roxette deliver this great package of hits from 1989-2003 all in one. If you've ever liked anything Roxette have done buy this! The new songs are amongst their best work yet proving the Swedish dynamites still have the goods. The bonus ep leaves every true fan wondering why songs like 'It hurts' & 'everyday' never made it onto official albums they are that good. Per Gessle and Marie Fredricksson have deliverd the goods once again, buy this you won't be disappointed!"
4,An impressive rational treatment of thermodynamics,"This is a text most suited for a second course of thermodynamics or for graduate students. Its treatment of thermodynamics is much more rational and structured than most college thermodynamics texts. The authors reduce the postulates of thermodynamics to two basic principles, and derive the 0th to 2nd laws from them, as well as the state principle and even Newton's 2nd law. They go on to present basic thermodynamic principles generally following Caratheodory's approach. One major drawback of this book is, of course, its price. However, for libraries in technical colleges and universities, this book is a must."
4,The most beautiful thermodynamics book ever written,"This textbook was passed onto me by my previous supervisor.I have always been looking for a thermo book that is exactly like that. Every concept is self-contained, and presented formally (mathematically and verbally) and succinctly. More impotantly, with this book I can teach these concepts myself, and can be referred to *quickly* in the future. It is both a beautiful textbook, and a handy reference book.Historically, the evolution of human understanding on the subject of heat and thermodynamics was best described as ""a big mess"". This book finally brought (almost) absolute order.Indeed, it is sad to see that this book is not really in print, and is very expensive (new). I am very fortunate to have my hand on it."
3,Original storyline,"In Poseidon's Shadow, SSBN Captain d'Alembert is given illegal orders by the Joint Chiefs that could set off WWIII. The captain decides to instead blackmail his superiors into giving him money and protection, as well as canceling their plans. They pretend to agree but actually send an attack sub out to hunt him down.In a sub-genre (pun not intended) filled with cold-war tales of the US vs the USSR, this novel provides an original story line that promises edge of the seat entertainment. Unfortunately, the story does not live up to its potential. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the prose limp and unexciting. It's unfortunate that such an good setup becomes dull and unsatisfying.If you've read all the other submarine action books, by all means read this one. But there are much better ones available for those just starting."

1,Kitman is an idiot,"Kitman is joke. I watched him on the History channel's "" Founding Fathers"" , and he is so misleading, incorrect and not funny."
4,Awesome Cam but...,"I love this camera, the 3"" display is bright, clear and sharp. I like how light it is. I hate the touch wheel, its a pain. I don't like the zoom rocker at all because it not intuitive, the power button is too small. The images come out beautiful in most light settings,the focus features are impressive. I loved the macro and color accent features. I would recommend this as a starter camera for anyone."
5,Amazing!,"This camera is so fast, even using flash! Great quality pics as well. You'll need to upgrade your memory card if you're gonna take alot of quality pics and videos. So small!"
5,Great Camera!,I bought this camera only about 6 hours ago but I'm already a wiz at using it. That's how easy it is to use. I didn't even read the whole manual. The picture quality is great and the LCD screen is big and gorgeous. I definitely reccomend this camera for anyone who's just starting out or anyone who wants a no-fuss camera.
1,Blurry pictures.,"I hate to post a negative review, but I feel I should in this case.I was never able to get clear pictures on this camera, no matter the settings. Most often the pictures were blurry, unless taken of a still object (like a table), or the camera was on a tripod.I don't expect a point and shoot to match my digital SLR, but I also can't always use a tripod either. I would hold the camera totally still (even with arms stabilized and holding my breath), and take a photo of still people, and the picture was blurry. The camera would always display the ""camera shake"" icon, even when I was as still as possible.In the end, I had to return it. I purchased a Canon Powershot SD 1100 IS instead, and so far I love it and have very clear focused pictures, even of moving objects.I chose one star because good pictures are the most important thing about a camera. Just wanted to warn others. Clearly, many people love it so maybe I got a dud."
2,not satisfied at all,"I was expecting more from this camera but fell short on my expectations. The outdoor colors are not the colors that you see. When you take a picture in the sunshine, it turns out grey rather than natural greeen. I played with the other colors too, but did not give me good results. So, anybody that are looking for this camera, you get good quality pictures inside but don't expect more when you are taking outdoor pictures, especically senries and landscapes."
5,amazing camera,"we wanted a smaller camera so that we would actually carry it around. This camera is great, I have no idea why people pay so much for much bigger cameras. This one is great for everything that we need. The convenience factor is huge. After several years lots of people just use their phones now but those phones cost big bucks and I doubt that they are as long lasting as this camera has been."
4,Shooting the Digital Way with Cannon,"I bought used on Amazon. Excellent photo quality, easy to use if you take the time to learn and very easy auto focus. Still difficult to see clearly in very bright sunlight but the 3"" LED is wonderful. Easy download to my Apple computer. Can't give it 5 stars as it is too new and I have not learned all the features."
3,"Great camera, but it BROKE within a month!","I loved everything about the camera, until it broke within a month of owning it!! I went to turn it on and the display didn't work. This is the second Canon I've had, and the second time I've had this problem! Their repairs and customer service are great. They fixed the last camera and I'm sure they'll fix this one, but I am surprised and disappointed for this to happen not only again, but so quickly (and I promise I did not drop it.)"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"It lasted me way less than a year. And I treated it like gold. It starts with the lens and goes to pot fast. And neither Amazon nor Canon back up their product. This thing will last about as long as a bad television program. Do yourself a favor, seek another camera, and deal with an outlet where you can talk to someone should things go belly-up."
3,"GOOD,but.....","i had this camera for 2 years, took great quality pictures and video, BUT randomly, my camera didn't work. it said the battery was low. the battery was fully charged!i bought a new battery and it just flat out didn't turn on! goood but i have no clue what happened to it"
5,Great Camera!!,"I love my Canon SD750. It is compact, easy to use, and takes great pictures. I would recommend it to anyone!!!"
4,Love It,"Spent a long time researching before I bought. I had a Kodak easyshare that took such bad pictures I was surprised and shocked they would sell such a bad camera. Love this one so far. Feels solid and sturdy, small enough to carry easily in small purses (or my Pelican Box for on the water)Picture quality is great and very user friendly. I know there are cameras with more options but easy point and click use was my priority after picture quality. Very happy so far."
5,Canon sd750,i love it!the screen has a scratch resistant protector already in place and the keys are simple and easy to use/ understand. how ever the continuos shooting mode lags a little bit slow not as many pics per second as older models. overall very happy though
4,Canon Digital Camera,"I had never filmed videos before, this camera makes it so easy! Great photos too, and it is so small it fits easily in any pocket or handbag."
4,question,Hi I just purchased the sd750 and i got to excited about the price do you know if it comes with a battery?? I have my old battery from the SD20 but i don't know if it would still fit! Let me know thats
2,"Disappointing Results, Returned SD750","After much research to find a high quality, reasonably priced compact digital camera to replace my bulkier Nikon 8700, I chose the SD750. The size and feel of the camera were great as were the menus and options. However, the performance left much to be desired as the pics taken during the 3 weeks I had the camera were poor. With picture quality being the most important factor when selecting a camera, I was disappointed to see the SD750 repeatedly blurring faces of people who were not the main subject of a photo as though the camera was unable to capture different depths in the same photo. I tried multiple settings without success and consulted my local Wolf Camera for options to improve performance, but had no success. I'm sticking with my Nikon 8700 which, despite its size, still takes great pics and has served me well for 3+ years.I'll give Amazon credit for an efficient and easy refund process."
1,Blurry,I like everything about this camera EXCEPT the pictures. The left third of every shot is blurry. I've sent it back to Canon for warranty service so I'm out the shipping and we will see about the repairs.
4,Very nice and easy to use!,"I had the SD400 that I really loved since it was so easy to use and shot great pics, but gave it to my mom since she didn't like the SD110 I gave her that looks awful and is embarrassing to take to public places (the silver body turned yellow, and has brown and gray spots all over). When the SD750 came in, I noticed a scratching noise when the lens retracted in and out. Fortunately, Amazon was nice to replace it and it's been great ever since. I really like the 3 inch LCD screen and how canon cameras are so easy to use. The only downside is how poorly the camera shoots at night when it's dark. My boyfriend has the SD630, which also has the nice 3.0 inch LCD screen, but it couldn't take pictures at night either. Overall, this is a great camera, although I hope canon takes the night shots into consideration in the next models. Then it'd be perfect."
5,Awesome point and shoot camera,"I've had a number of Canon digital and film camera's over the years. When it comes to digital models in professional and for the point and shoot group, they are simply the best. I recently purchased the SD750, admittingly, it has a couple of limitations, manual controls are limited, zoom range is only 3X. But on the positive side, it has a huge screen, start up is very fast, focusing is fast, and the pictures turn out great. Video works pretty well and you can use the zoom while in video mode. Oh, and one more thing, it's the size of a deck of cards. This is a great little, point and shoot camera, no frills, just function. What else do you really need for a pocket size camera that will give you excellent results. If you want more zoom, and maybe some image stabilization, look at the SD850. But for the money, the SD750 is an excellent, all around, take anywhere pocket camera!"
4,good product,although is not as robust as previous models it takes good pictures and it is very conveniently priced.
4,Great Cheap Camera,"Keeping this review simple, the camera was a present for my younger brother. I am one of those people who research and research and research some more. With Price in mind an older camera was needed. Canon has always been known for its picture quality. Although this camera does not have 5x optical zoom and image stability, all the other features are top quality. for this price range you can't get anything better."
4,Review Canon Powershot SD750 Camera,"Great product! Clear, precise pictures; anti-shake feature is nice; movies are easy to make...haven't figured out how to download them yet though. Iphoto just accepts the first picture, not the movie. Most times, indoor light exposure is automatically adjusted to give a better indoor picture, but sometimes the pictures still come out darker than desired. Very compact. Rechargeable battery is terrific! It only takes 90 minutes to charge, and it lasts for at least 100 pictures. All in all, a nice camera."
1,Horrible camera! Pictures are BLURRY!,"I gave my old 5 MP Sony DSC-W5 to my little sister and decided to give canon a try for the first time. This camera is amazing on the first look; I love the 3"" screen, new features, and the new thin look over my bulky Sony DSC-W5. However, It wasn't until I took a few pictures when I found out what a horrible piece of junk it is. Pictures taken with this camera are SO BLURRY! No matter how much I played around with the settings, I could not get a single crisp shot. If you zoom into the pictures, you'll notice the blur around edges of all objects. I am so disappointed. I can not beleive people have given this camera good ratings. The camera is in the box and back to Amazon. I'm going back to Sony."
4,No Problems,Just got back from vacation and got to use the camera alot. Nice pictures and quick shots. The one bad thing is there is not enough warning when the batteries charge is almost out. I have a 2nd battery on the way. Otherwise we loved it.Rich
4,A Great Value!,"I love this camera! It takes excellent pictures in a variety of situations (dark, bright, etc.) and is very user friendly. There are lots of options to play around with, and they don't take a lot of time to learn. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a great value!"
4,Love it!,"I love this camera. The images are so crisp and clear. The image automatically flips when the camera rotates...just be careful once you upload because you will need to rotate 180. The only downside I have noted is what I read prior to purchase. there isn't a battery life indicator. The battery has, however, lasted forever. It has been several weeks since I have charged it."
2,Blurry/Soft photos,"No matter how I set up the camera, the pictures are just not very crisp. They are very ""soft"" and blurry. My Dad's 2 year old, 4MP Kodak takes WAY better pictures. I have a feeling that I may have gotten a bad camera and will try to return it for another one just to give it one more chance. Most people seem to love this camera, but there area few of us that are not getting very good clarity it he pictures.Other than that, I love the camera's size, features, feel, & ease of use."
4,canon pwrshot,It is an awesome camra. The only minor problem I found is that you can't find the battery charge status. the only signal you recieved is when battery is at 10%
4,Love the classic black exterior,"I received this item in 2 days from ordering using free shipping. I love amazon's service and I love this camera. Amazon offered the best price compare to everywhere else. This is a great camera, it takes good picture. The only negatives I have about this camera is that the picture doesn't appear to great at night, no wide angle lens. Other than that, the camera is fun to play with and great for its price."
4,BEST CAMERA!,BEST INVESTMENT I HAVE EVER DONE. I LIKE THE FEATURES AND THE SCREEN IS AMAZING! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAMERA AND RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE GETS IT.
4,Very nice.,"This camera is GREAT for a point and shoot. Small enough to carry around without feeling bulky. Is limited in zoom and distance night shooting. The images don't reflect the light from the flash so pictures come out really dark. Even though this camera has a red eye feature...I still seem to be getting red eyes..maybe its something I'm doing wrong. Video option works really nicely. I love the different scene options that you can choose from...fireworks, night, indoor, etc. For the price, this camera is well worth your money."
4,Good camera for the price,The camera is pretty good. I wish there was less noise when zoomed in to 100%I haven't had any problems with it but I wish it had image stabilization sometimes. Colors look good to me but there is always the noise/blurriness problem.The form factor of the camera is ok but it's really really small. I'm a bigger guy so it is a big downside. (But all cameras at this price are made for children's hands.)It's a good buy for anything less than two hundred dollars.(Don't buy it from DBROTH though)
1,Black spots on the lcd display,"I own this camera since about 2 years, but now I'm experiencing what seems to be a known issue with canon SD : Black spots on the lcd display (see [...]).It took great indoor pictures, above average outdoor pictures, I love the size but now this camera is useless as this black spot appears on pictures as well as on the LCD display or on VGA movies. Another weak point of this model is the battery life, after six month I couldn't get more than 80 pictures, now after 2 years, the battery can barely make 20 pictures, I guess I need spare battery. So in conclusion, I probably no longer choose a canon SD for my next digital point and shoo."
5,Bought when first came out in 2007,"Owned for two and half years and is the BEST camera I have ever owned. Traveled from the volcanos of Iceland to blustery winters of Sweden to the nightlife of Sydney Australia and Auckland New Zealand to the LA, NY and the hill country of central Texas. Awesome camera. Love it. Now I'm considering purchasing the newer version of this camera (SD780) that films in HD."
2,"Nice design, large LCD, just fair picture quality","I was attracted to this camera because I have long been a Canon fan and have had several over that past 15 years, however I was disappointed in this purchase. I LOVE the large LCD screen on the back, and like the overall design of the camera. It's also very easy to use and the menus are easy to navigate. My main gripe is that the pictures are more often than not, very fuzzy and unclear. My previous Canon SD400 took tack sharp pictures in almost all situations, it was difficult to not take a good picture. With this camera, I am constantly getting out of focus, blurry shots. It seems very difficult to capture a really nice sharp photo. This is a huge problem in my opinion. I would not recommend this camera to anyone for this very reason. I have already given away my SD400 camera, wish I had it back now."
5,Canon PowerShot SD750 7.1MP Digital Camera,"This is a great camera! Everyone should have one. The price is good and the size is compact and easy to carry. Large (3"") LCD screen makes it super easy to view your subject before taking pic."
2,Not sharp at all,I think since the vr came out the cameras have changeI have been with digital cameras since 2000 and my 1st digital cameras was a canon a10 1 megapixel and I can tell you it make more sharper pictures then this 7 mpI can't find a good camera now in these days.
3,Everything great but zooming isn't,Great product compare to my Canon 30D DSLR camera but Zooming isn't that great after 2x ~3x quality. It looks digital zoom after zooming to 2~3x.I love this product but mostly using 1x zoom.
4,Quality camera but at this price should have more features,"Takes great pics and the 3"" screen is REALLY nice. Wall plug in recharger is nice also. I have taken pics outside in sunny, overcast, & rainy conditions. Indoors at sporting events and around the house. In all settings the pics have been truly wonderful. A few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics.However, as Canon's top of the line Powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom. 3x isnt enough when other, cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom. Also Image Stabilzation should be included."
1,never received,"I never received this camera - its been several weeks past the promised date, and i contacted the seller with no response. Needless to say I do NOT recommend this seller"
5,fast ordering,"I've ordered a number of things on the internet, but its never gone this fast and easy before! All the steps were clear and easy to follow, and my order showed up quickly with no problems. I would order through these guys again, no hesitation!"
5,Perfect........,"This camera is perfect..... for an ultra-compact camera. It is limited, naturally, in it's optical performance, but it more than makes up for this in ""bells and whistles"". Great quality PC video, clear vibrant photos, and it fits in a pocket. There are numerous electronic features that make this an excellent choice for that ""travel camera"". This is not the one, if you are looking for ""A camera"", as you will need to spend a little more and choose something with better optics. But for that travel camera pocket point and shoot.... perfect. You won't be disappointed. Oh, buy that extra battery, as you will find this camera to be convenient and so much fun to use, you'll need it."
5,Cannon PowerShot SD750,"Best price and super quality.If you love compact, point and shoot high performance camera, this is it."
4,"As always, Canon has made another solid product",I am very pleased with the camera and I would recommend it to anyone. My only issue is the small memory card that Canon provides.
5,I didn't know anything about digital cameras............,"So, when my husband wanted one for Christmas, I had to have my kids help me. They are all grown now, and had purchased a few amongst themselves in the past couple of years. I knew I had to have a large viewing screen since my husband won't wear his glasses and is pretty blind without them! So from there, we just looked over all the possibilities, and my daughter finally said, ""If I were buying one today, this is the one I'd pick."" Good enough for me. It was medium priced, and had the big screen I wanted. He really likes it, has used it a few times, the kids have shown him how to put the pics on the computer. He's not very tech advanced, so it must be pretty user friendly. I'm a happy customer."
4,Great Camera,"Got this for my wife and she loves it. It take great pics and is easy to use in all the modes. Battery has been great. I also bought 2 of the CTA batteries and they work equally well. The only thing I would change is the battery cover. It is easy to open by accident, but it has not been a problem."
2,Canon Powershot SD750 7.1 MP,Very poor product giving blurry images. You have to really be very cautious and give time to hold the camera extremely steady to obtain reasonably good pictures. I recently bought this from Amazon because my Kodak CX7430 was giving problem of battery discharging quickly. But Kodak gave far superb quality images.I feel soemtimes if Canon product is bad or Amazon passed on a refurbished product to me...
5,very good camera,"I also purchased the canon powershot sd600 elph at target about a year ago, and I prefer this model which I bought for cheaper on Amazon. So far, there were absolutely no problems with it and im completely satisfied"
2,"Not compatible with 3rd generation, even though it is advertised that way","I bought this set to charge and sync my 3rd generation IPOD. The sync cable would sync the IPOD, but it would not charge it. It turns out that the 3rd generation IPODs could only charge through FireWire. The product is advertised as compatible with 3G, but that is only partially true. Since it only charges through FireWire, the cable syncs, but it will not charge, and the other two parts are worthless. The plastic it is made from also feels a little flimsy. If you have an IPOD 4G and up, and you don't mind a product that is probably not all that durable, then the price is good. No real deal here, you definitely get what you pay for with this product."
3,Canon Powershot SD750 digital camera,"this camera takes fairly good pictures in terms of the clarity and the sharpness. The size is also convenient compact. When I zoom in for the fine print, the details come out fairly well. The menu and the tool bars are not the easiest to navigate, however, and the buttons can be very confusing to use."
5,Great Camera for this price range,"I recently returned from two trips which is the reason I purchased this camera. I already own a digital camera which is too bulky to throw in my purse so I have to carry it around my neck letting everyone know I'm a tourist. The SD750 Elph camera was the perfect solution. I was able to carry it in my purse or pocket and always ready for that perfect picture. More important, it takes great pictures, as good if not better than my more expensive camera."
5,Canon Elph SD750,"This takes excellent photos with great quality. I love so many things about the camera. I was nevous about getting it at first--I was torn between the sd750 and the sd1000, but I'm glad I chose the 750. It has facial recognition for one thing, and if you're browsing your photos that you've taken, the camera KNOWS which was you're holding the camera and will show the pictures accordingly. Rather hard for me to explain, I think, but it's cool as hell.I like this so much AND my boyfriend has expressed interest in the camera, I'm going to buy the silver version of it as a Christmas present for him. For once I know what I am getting him months ahead of time. :)"
4,"Great camera as always, but casing feels cheaper than predecessors?",The SD family line seems to always deliver. My only beef is that the casing seems to made of a cheaper material than before. No problems so far.
3,Mixed feelings,"I'll start this off by saying this is my first digital camera and I'm not an avid photographer. However,I am puzzled by this camera.The controls are very easy to figure out, and using the camera is a breeze. But the pictures don't turn out right. Everything is way too vivid and unnatural looking.I've tried everything imaginable to fix this, since there are a ton of settings and modes to play around with and I've read the troubleshooting in the instruction book, but NONE of my pictures look natural. That being said, since I'm not an avid photographer, maybe this is really good compared to other cameras, but it's not perfect.The video feature is great. The sound is ok, and the picture on that looks better than the photographs.To summarize, the Pros are: Easy to figure out controls and pretty good video, and the Con is that it's been impossible to get a natural looking picture."
1,LENS ERROR !!!,"After buying this 35 days ago, the picture is blurry and it wont focus. The zoom won't function and I get a flashing message ""LENS ERROR"". Luckily, my vendor agreed to replace it even though it was more than 30 days. I have loved Canon cameras but after my Rebel XT died last month and this defective SD750, this will be my last Canon purchase.Don't buy Canon or get a 5 year warranty upon purchase to protect your investment."
5,Great item,"Very easy to use, this is my second Canon camera and I really like the quality of the pictures and video."
4,Good Pictures!,"We originally wanted a Sony because their pictures seemed to be best overall, especially compared to our old Casio. But we went with the Canon because we heard it was better than the Sony. I can't compare them directly, but the Canon is definitely better than our old Casio and we think our pictures now could not be much better. Very few ""bad"" pictures. Have not worked with the video function to review that feature."
5,Compact & easy to use,"I bought this camera for my wife. She learned to use it quickly and enjoys the small, lightweight format. My wife has limited technical skills, so I was pleased she started using the camera immediately."
5,Great Camera,"I like everything about this camera and it works great!The only improvement I can think of is that it does not show a battery power meter, so basically you have to judge how much battery power is left, or buy a back up battery."
4,Canon PowerShot SD750 7.1MP Digital Elph,Delivery of product was exactly on time. Product was great. Better than advertised. Takes great pictures. Fairly easy to use. Needs some learning curve for indoor pictures. Would buy again if had a choise.
3,Its Good,"I have owned this camera for 2 years now and I loved it for the first year I had it. Unfortunately, within the past few months my pictures have been extremely blurry. If I don't zoom in just a tiny bit the picture will end up blurry. I have checked all my settings, and even reset them back to factory settings and I am still having this problem. So maybe it is the lens? I am not sure! I will definately be buying a new camera sometime soon, just wish this one would have lasted more than 2 years.."
3,Lens Error Restart,I really enjoyed this camera until it malfunctioned recently with a Lens Error - Restart Message. I really suggest reviewing other models and seeing if the same problem exists or comes up consistently. Avoid the hassle and expense. It was very frustrating. I will admit I did get at least two years out of it before the issue came up.Of course the warranty wasn't any good at that point.
4,Beautiful and Does the job!,"The camera is one of the best I have seen from Canon. It is really beautiful and cute. This is probably the 10 th camera I have bought so far (I have a lot of friends and family :-) ) and this one ranks top among point and shoot cameras.The pictures taken using scene modes were really good. It had a very fast bootup and I was able to start taking snap very fast, unlike some other cameras which needs some warm up time.I have used it only for couple of days now, so my review is limited, but the only problem I see as of now is the LCD view finder is sort of grainy while taking a picture. The grains do not come int he final picture, or when you are in the play mode to see the pictures on the camera."
1,Below avarage camera,"Bad white balance on outdoor images, indoor pictures are blurry and too warm. Colors are not lively, you never get the sharpness expected from a 7.1 MP camera. I owned a Sony DSC-W1 for 4 years and this camera is not even close to that. Don't let these 5 star reviews fool you."
1,Unexpected Problems,"Canon PowerShot SD750 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)The camera worked great for 33 days and then the display went out. It would show icons and images retained in the camera, but not the image viewed through the lens. I shipped it to Canon's repair facility who honored the warranty and confirmed ""that the service you requested on your POWER SHOT SD750 (SILVER) has been completed and your equipment has been shipped to you"". Unfortunately they reversed some numbers in my street address and my camera may or may not arrive at my house. (I called Canon who corrected the address but I'm not sure if it was in time. The most recent email from Canon still shows the wrong address)"
4,"Great pics, easy to use, great value","Pics are great. Not professional, but better than the other compacts I've used. I've had it for a while and it's still in great shape, even without using a case for it."
4,Great Camera,"The Canon SD750 is a great camera. I have owned a Digi Rebel XT for a year and wanted to have a P&S as a back-up. I am extermely happy with my purchase; the start-up time is really quick, allowing you to take pics quickly within startup. The 'ease of use' is plentiful as well! if you want to make it technical, you can as well in 'creative mode'. If you are going to use this camera for extended amounts of time and shooting ( more than 1.5 hours streight, i recomend having an xtra battery; but have yet to be disapointed because it was 'totally' dead and unable to take pictures. The camera is constantly feeding hi-res picture from the lens to the massive-3"" LCD; so switch the settings to turn off lens faster to extend battery life; also, turn brightness down on LCD. Pic quality is great, color great, everything about it is great! recomend this camera to anyone interested!"
4,canon sd750,"Nice compact chasis, large clear bright lcd, good looks and sharp pic's. Weakness is flash, cannot adjust intensity like in Casio and no battery power indicator until battery very low."
5,AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!,This is one of the best digital cameras I have ever owned or used. It has all the features most of us want and more. For the price you can't go wrong.
5,awsome camera,"I have used this camera in Iraq for 9 months. On and off missions. I have taken over 2,000 pic's and about 20 videos using the Elph. I am so happy with this camera and the easy to use featurs. While I was on mission my driver hit a big bump in the road and the camera fell out of my hand and broke the shutters. To go though 9 months of where and just now have it brake... Amazing. So I am buying anotherone."
2,Card locked error,"I bought this camera and sent to my family in India, after taking out the SD card 4-5 times, it has started giving the error ""Memory card locked"". It was not the SD card problem as we have tried using other memory card which were working perfectly on other cameras. After searching on internet, we found that there is a hardware problem with this series where it reset the memory card lock reader in the camera. It sucks, as I have purchased this from USA the warranty is not available in India.Other than than it takes a while to take picture, screen is good however image quality is not that much good which I was expecting."
4,GREAT CAMERA,THIS CAMERA HAS ALOT FOR BEING SO SMALL. I LOVE IT!! GREAT PICTURES AND EVERYTHING IS EASY TO USE.
4,An evolution of the Ixus,"The SD750 replaces my old (and rather dead) original Digital Ixus and improves on it in almost every respect: it's smaller, the picture quality is better, it's slightly faster.But it has two things I don't like:1. The change from manual mode to auto mode is too complex (on the old model it was a switch, now it's a menu option).2. Still no RAW support."
1,Great Camera Terrible Service,"I love this camera and bought it after I lost the very similar Canon SD200. The problem was Amazon. It took them almost two weeks to deliver. The event I wanted the camera for had already happened. The camera was in stock, and shipped out of their Berkeley, CA facility. That's only 40 miles from me. If they'd just let the camera out of the box it probably could have made its own way here faster than Amazon's delivery. Anyway, it is a nice camera, but if I had it to do over I'd go out and buy it at Target or Best Buy.It just wasn't worth the wait."
5,WOW! In A Small Package.,"The definition in the photos taken with this camera is truly amazing. You can take pictures like the pros--clear with brilliant colors. The options on the camera a too many to mention. I am sure it will take some time before I am proficient with the advanced aspect of the camera, but I am excited about the opportunity. If you are looking for a compact camera with big camera attributes, then this is the one for you."
3,Not bad for the price,"My only complaint is that sometimes I will end up with a slightly blurry picture. My guess is that the shutter speed is not fast enough...or I'm not using the right setting (i.e. indoor, outdoor, portrait)."
5,Great Point and Shoot,Bought this for my teenage daughter. She loves it and constantly uses it for photos and movies. Canon makes a great product!
1,Not worth watching!,"The descriptions and imagery on the box gives you a false sense of what you are about to see. I imagined great samurai fight scenes, an attractive main star with some Japanese style nudity and adult scenes. It was horrible, to the point I could not finish watching it. Amatuer, at best. Do not waste time or money on this film!"
2,Laughable Ninja Skin Flick Minus Skin...,"I had read reviews of this series and most were very favorable, so I decided to check one out, and this one was the cheapest investment. Unfortunately, it`s lame on every level - the acting bad, the characters infantile, the dialogue laughable, the fight scenes were girly-lame, and there were only three sex scenes in the entire movie...all of them lacking in one way or another. I enjoy a good 'bad' movie as well as 'pink' cinema, but this one didn`t deliver anything that was promised on the box, the Amazon product details, or in the reviews. Avoid this one entirely, the other reviewers must be 14 year-olds looking for their first titillation..."
4,Ninja Skin Flick,Not the greatest movie but a lot of skin. Also the acting and dialog wasn't to good either but if you just want to see Asian women naked this is a movie for you.
2,dim,Thought these were pretty dim. Many other lights are better than these. Look elsewhere if you need them bright. Would work for some applications.
4,"Hard, but Really Cool","This game made my blood boil as a kid. It can be pretty unforgiving, but it's a solid game--sans the occasional typos in the text. I love the music and the graphics. I recommend it for anyone who remembers the Sega Master System. It's no Ghouls and Ghosts, but it's definitely hard enough to make you throw a controller at least once. Ah, the good old days."
4,Best choice,"it is very easy to use, you only have one switch to choose between feet/meter, but do not use it to measure a distance which is more than 10 meters otherwise you'll get wrong reading.it is perfect to measure rooms with walls.cons,you cannot change the battery...that is why i gave it 4"
5,good for quick and dirty measuring,"We used this just for when we were looking at houses and wanted to get room size estimates. It was fairly accurate and consistent, just be sure to not send the signal toward windows or an irregular space like a half wall when you want to measure that smaller space vs. the entire room. I wouldn't use it to measure for anything specific- for example, to get down to the mm measurement for cutting wood or selecting furniture where you need to be very precise (like the uber tiny DC row house we were moving into). But perfect for our purpose."
4,Awesome Music!!!,"If you love the Rocky series, and the music, you'll definitely enjoy this CD! It has classics like 'Gonna Fly Now' and 'Eye of the Tiger' It also has the gangsta' rap song 'It's a Fight' by the Three 6 Mafia! I highly recommend THE BEST OF ROCKY!!!"
3,"""Cut me Mick""..................","""Cut me Mick"" because I don't see all of the best tracks on this CD. This CD has a good mix of music tracks from the Rocky series but there are alot of the the better tracks missing. ""Philadelphia Morning"", ""First Date"". ""Take you back"", ""Vigil"", and Eye of the Tiger. How can you leave out these emotion filled tunes??? I wish they would've made this a 2-CD collection. Just about all of the tracks from Rocky I should be included because it gave the audience an emotional picture about Rocky's life and what he was going through. Oh well, not to shabby but could've been great! I gotta go work out now.....that's what these tunes do to you."
4,"Great, but...","...where are ""War"" and ""Training Montage"" from Rocky IV? Even ""Take You Back"" could've been thrown in there somewhere. I guess on any ""Best Of"" collection, there will be some glaring omissions.Aside from that, it's a great collection (though I could've done without ""Can't Stop the Fire""). The remix of ""Gonna Fly Now"" is listenable, something that can't be said about a lot of remixes. A definite must for any fan of the Rocky franchise."
5,great music,"plan to give as gift for doggie's birthday, sorry for the delay, I've been in transition, will probably purchase one more"
4,Rocky,"Most of the songs were great. If I knew that last few songs were Rap I would not have bought this CD. Also, some of the songs have script from the movies, which I didn't like. The vendor was great and the cd arrived on time."
3,Rehash,"As much as I love the ""Rocky"" series, I wish I'd not bothered to buy this CD. With the exception of Three 6 Mafia's ""It's a Fight,"" the songs in ""Rocky Balboa: The Best of Rocky"" are identical to those in soundtracks from the previous films. If you have those, you won't need this one."
1,Waiting for my ship to come in!,I don't know anything about this item. I haven't received it yet even though I bought it over a month ago. It was sent by Royal Mail from Europe and I guess it went down with the ship!
1,Old Repeater Only 3 song Total Ripoff!!!,"My friend James recommened that I get the soundtrack that there were at least 9 great songs. Well maybe there were in the movie, but they certainly were not on this CD. I wasted my money.Only 3 songs Rocky theme, Eye Tiger, and Livin in America. Total ripoff!!"
4,Gotta Love Rocky Balboa!!,"This album takes all of the great music from the first four Rocky movies and does an excellent job of putting them together on one disc. A great feature not yet mentioned in the Amazon.com reviews is that there are classic lines from the movies placed in between most of the tracks. For example, before ""No Easy Way Out"" Rocky says his famous line; ""Cuz I'm a fighter. That's the I'm made Adrian. We can't change what we are"" (from Rocky IV). There are a couple problems, however:- Three Six Mafia has no place in a Rocky soundtrack. It does not fit in with the rest of the music and should have been left out.- War and Training Montage are not included. Cut the Three Six Mafia song and the weak (yet still good) track ""Adrian"" and we would have had plenty of space for those two gems.Other than that, this album does a great job in representing a sometimes overlooked aspect of the Rocky movies: The music."
1,Nope,"So I bought this without even bothering to read any of the chapters. Boy, was THAT a mistake, but I read it because I didn't have anything else at the time. If you're real desperate for supernatural stories, and I mean REAL desperate, than I guess you could get this book. If you're into stories like ""Aperitif"" (by Susan Raffo): the story about the woman who relates having her glass eye [filled] with sex or the story about a guy who gets trapped on a sheet of film-yes CAMERA FILM - (""Newtime Cowboy"" by Joyce Wagner)then this is the book for you. Unfortuately, as you can see, this WASN'T the book for me but everyone has their own tastes."
4,A fabric-based book on color,"If you want to know why some of the color schemes in your quilts work or don't (!) this is a great book to read. Unlike many other general texts on color, this book relates to the color and texture of fabric, making it easier to apply color techniques to your own quilts.I would have liked more examples of each of the types of color schemes and fabrics on the color wheel, but it has definitely changed the way I view fabrics and color in the world at large. I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn more about color interactions."
3,Interesting but not especially useful,"This book contains a lot of facts about hues, shades, tints, complements, split complements, triads, tetrads, luminosity, transparency, contrast, depth and intensity. If you really care about all these things, then this is just the book for you. The author explains this ""color vocabulary"" very well, using examples and exercises. But do we really need to know all that to make beautiful quilts? No, I don't think so. I used to think I had no color sense but this book made me realize that I choose my fabrics well without thinking about color theory."
3,memphis star,this album is quite good its worth getting if you into memphis underground although his other album summer drama is better this guy goes way back to 90s hes bin there from the start with 8ball mjg playa fly smk anyhow this is worth having in your collection
5,Perfect snack!,"These are the perfect snack for on the go. Actual REAL fruit--No sugar! No ""roll-ups"" with 10% fruit! They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well. Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack. Works in any weather (won't melt) and even survives at the bottom of the purse! Comes in lots of flavors, an organic version, and smaller bars too for a lighter snack. Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store. GREAT!!"
3,Great Taste,"I wanted to get a healthy snack for my adult son since he usually turns to snacks high in sugar and salt. He stated that the taste was great however, it caused some sensitive issues with his stomach. I suggested that perhaps the fiber was to much for him so he should try to only eat 1/2 at a time. So far ok. So I say to those who have sensitive stomachs, proceed with caution."
4,Good product....,"The quality is good, for a okay price.One complain, the serving base is not easy to come off, especially if you have something inside the pan. Sure hope Kuhn Rikon improve on that."
2,The picture showing is not the right one,"Till today, the picture showing on the site is still not the right one. Anyway, it's kind of fit to Zire handheld. It is functional in terms of protective case However, it might not be convenient to have while you are using your handheld."
5,italian style,i know this item that`s why i bought it. There is nothing that i would wanted to know before i purchased the product.
5,stefano di battista round about roma,"I heard the tune ""romeo and juliet several times before and never knew who that was ,and then one day I heard it, found out who it was ,and went online and purchased it, and I was certainly happy that I did.I love this cd, and would recommend to any jazz lover like myself."
1,WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have tried to use this pump on several occasions.... like the book says:after a shower, after a feeding, before a feeding, and so on. The suction is not there at all. I haven't even bought another pump so that i don't waste my money, there is no returns (which i understand why);however, i think that the retailers should stand behind the products they sell, why should we have to deal with the manufacturer?!"
1,Almost a complete waste of money,"I bought this breastpump after reading reviews that it was the best manual pump there is. Now I think I'm going to throw this thing out the window!! I've never tried another manual pump so I can't compare, but I can tell you this one is very frustrating to use..It loses suction all the time, especially with the petal thing. It's very messy as well--I've spilled milk on myself numerous times. I've also sat pumping for an hour and gotten only drops. (And my milk supply is good.) If this is the best manual pump out there, God save us all. I'm getting an electric one tomorrow."
2,OK,"The pump comes with plenty of accessories for storage and feeding which makes it a great buy, but the let down massage coushin is no good. It doesn't provide a tight seal around the funnel so suction is poor. I use the pump without the coushin and the suction is powerful, and painful because more of the nipple is being pulled into the funnel. I find myself having to pump with one hand and massage the breast with the other to get the milk to start to flow. I would reccomend this machine with caution."
5,great pump once you get used to it!,"I got this as a shower gift. It has been really helpful and extremely efficient. At first breast feeding and pumping was very painful. So I rented the Medula from the hospital for the first month. The Medula (a $1,000 unit) is a great dual pump system that works more gently than my newborn or the Avent. It was nice to use the dual pump as I got used to breastfeeding. But once I got used to it, I didn't use the Medula at all and was using the Avent. The dual pump had A LOT of parts to clean (2 pumps) and was a bit tricky to manuveur holding 2 pumps at the same time. The Avent was very efficient in expressing milk, easily extracting 5oz. from a single breast in under 10 minutes. It is very important to have the pump assembled correctly (my husband still puts the valve plug in backwards no matter howmany times I show him) So it's easy to see why some women may have had problems. But once the unit is assembled properly, this pump works FANTASTICALLY!!"
4,Great pump for occasional use,"This pump is great for those of you who only need to pump occasionally in my opinion. It definitely takes some practice to get the right suction, but once you figure it out, it is incredibly simple to use. It is very easy to clean and take apart. I gave this pump 4 stars simply because of the fact that it does get very squeaky, which is really annoying!In comparison to other manual pumps that I have tried, this one is definitely the best.I do however own a Medela Electric Pump and prefer it over any manual pump."
3,Don't be fooled!,"Although this pump is a high quality manual pump, please do not believe the ""clinical test results"" putting it a the same level as an electric pump. I bought into that marketing ploy and now I'm out 50 bucks.The pump does pump, but it took me 30 minutes to pump a half an ounce and my hand was hurting after the first 10 minutes. I eventually went to see a lactation consultant and bought the Medela Pump in Style Advanced. It's great. It was expensive, but when you compare the price of the pump to the price of formula, it's worth it.I will tell everyone I know to go see a lactation consultant before buying anything. You'll be able to try out different pumps and get some advice at the same time.Do not buy this pump if you are going to be pumping more than once in awhile.I do love the Avent bottles though!"
1,does not work for all,"Now that my baby is 3 months old, I'm going back and rating everything...this is one of those items that absolutely did not work for me. I've tried it with full, half-full, and barely full breasts. I can't get one drop out with this pump. I ended up with the medella electric pump and love it-- use it daily without difficulty. The only thing that I can figure is that I never have a let-down feeling, not do I leak so maybe my breasts are too uptight for the hand pump. I do like avent bottles though!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is the first time I write a review but after buying this crap I felt I had to. I have used Avent products before for my two older children and was always satisfied. After reading the reviews for the breast pump I decided to try it out. I thought it might be a good alternative since I did not plan to pump very much. Well, it ended in the garbage can. Basically, the pump has no suction. I have a baby nurse helping me out for the first weeks and she has many years of experience. She cannot believe how bad this product is. DO NOT BUY IT. SAVE THE MONEY. I ended up buying a Medela electric pump and I am happy with it."
4,"Great manual pump, but consider an electric","This really is a great manual pump, but . . . I'm a stay-at-home mom so I thought a manual pump would be enough, but as my baby gets older and I need to pump more (for milk for his cereal, to put in a sippy cup, etc.) my hand gets exhausted from all the pumping and it takes up so much of my time. I wish I had spent the extra money and purchased the electric pump."
2,Save your money and Buy an Electric pump,"After receiving the Avent Isis Back to work Manual Pump at my shower...I thought I was all set. Until I had the baby, successfully breastfed for 3 weeks, and tried to ""Hand Pump"" and it did not work. And of course, once you open these packages...you can not return or exchange. So I bought the First Years Easy Comfort Single pump, (only 40 dollars more)HOPING, that this would work for me. AND IT DID. I unpacked it, and was able to pump 4 oz on the first try!! Save your money and skip the manual pumps...they may work for some people, but spend the extra few dollars for a really good electric one and be sure that you will be making a good investment!"
5,Terrific Manual Pump,"I received this pump for my shower and I have been thrilled with it! I am sure its not quite as quick as an electric pump, but I am at home and it has been perfect for that. I would highly recommend this for any SAHM who is breast feeding but looking for a pump."
4,Great Pump,"This is a great pump and storage system. The only problem I have with it is at times it squeaks when depressing the handle. I've tried repositioning and reassembling, thinking it was the way I was using it, but it didn't help. It is annoying. I'm just thankful it doesn't squeak every time I use it. It is a great pump, I can pump a 9 ounce bottle in 5 minutes very comfortably. I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a good manual pump. Definitely worth every penny!"
1,Loses suction.,"I bought this model when my daughter was 2 weeks old because she could not latch on to me. Have had only one month when the petal liner would detach during pumping. I pump every 2 hours and find this very frustrating. I called advent , they told me to boil the small parts in distilled water and several teaspoons of white vinegar. They also said not to wash with antibacterial dish detergent, that that and the breast milk leaves a residue on the parts that make them not stick as well. Not real convenient when I have two older sons to take care of as well. Bottom line, I am looking for a new pump. $50 dollars down the drain."
4,Great Product,"I have used this pump with two children and plan to get a new one for my third. With my first child, I was able to use this pump to supply 75% of his milk for over 5 months (until going back to work full time). I was unable to nurse, but I had no trouble with this pump. With my second child, I was able to nurse, but needed to use a pump when I went back to work . I tried an electric pump thinking it would be more efficient and finally had to go back to the Avent hand pump. To be fair, the electric pump was not a great one -- I could not afford to spend the money necessary. Now expecting my third child, I plan to get another Avent Isis. I found it efficient and painless. The only draw back with frequent use is that the various pieces to wear out. However, I do not regret buying this pump."
2,"convenient, but it hurts!","This pump hurts like crazy! I guess I just don't have the tolerence for 30 minutes of pain every few hours. With this manual pump you have to pump one side at a time. Thus it takes just as long as it would to breastfeed so why not just do that? The cost of this manual is great, plus you get storage containers that you can use as bottles. Those are the only two reasons I gave it 2 stars."
3,it kind of worked,"I have xtra large breasts and I could maybe get 2 ounces out of both sides when I used this pump- I also have an electric medela that I am borrowing fron the health dept.- all states want to promote breast feeding, so they buy the nice pumps and we get to borrow them- great idea- I would get up to 5 ounces from one breast in like ten minutes. with the crazy bottle things that this particular one has- I've heard that if you freeze your milk in it- it takes hours to de thaw, I actaully use nice thick ziplock freezer bags and de thaw under warm water- it works great- anyways if you can't afford a nice electric breast pump try to borrow one from the health dept, breast feeding is so good for your child-"
4,Older book but very helpful!,"I ordered another workbook on tables and graphs that was alot newer, but liked this one far better. I am using it for my highschooler who has difficulty imaging math and this book has really helped her understand how tables and graphs work."
3,Missing A Cut,"I notice this is essentially the same album as Prelude's After The Goldrush, but is missing this jewel. That's why I decided not to buy this item."
3,Right Title but wrong picture,Please have the picture for item updated to reflect its title and text information. The picture is for its assocatied document.
4,Almost Perfect,"I have three other Glass Hammer CD's and many other prog albums. I have been a prog fan since the glory days of ELP, Yes, Camel, and Kansas. LEX REX ranks right up there with the best of them. It is a keyboard tour de force! The bass playing is excellent too. There are not any weak songs, unlike the other Glass Hammer CD's I have. In some places the vocals are only good, not excellent. The same is true of the drumming; in one very brief place it is irksome. If this CD had been recorded with a great prog drummer like Phil Ehart or Nick D'Virgilio, LEX REX would be prog classic."
1,poor,i believe this band said... lets make the most annoying sounds possible for over an hour. they have fully completed there mission. best thing is the cover art work.in the recycle trash.
5,"No, the First Cut is ""Supposed"" to sound like a record!","Love this CD. I almost fainted when the first track came on, and I heard ""record static."" It's less than a minute, and I just bypass it now. I agree with all that's been said about this album except the takes on the drummer. I've played for 45 years, and the drumming on this album is first rate. It's very clean and fits perfectly. I really don't get the insults handed to this drummer. I would love to sound this good!"
3,Quite a thorough read,"This book was on the 1st Marine Division's recommended reading list for officers about to deploy to Afghanistan. It is thorough and long. It's also an extremely dry read. That said there are portions of it that are quite informative, making this an overall great resource for those who are about to visit the region. One thing to remember, though, is that this book was published in the 1970's, so there is no reference to the Russian invasion, Taliban or post-911 engagements."
3,Oldies from Tess Mallos,"I'm a big fan of Tess Mallos. Her recipes are simple, healthy, and produce results good enough for entertaining. Her ""Complete Middle East Cookbook"" is a must-have for anyone who likes the foods hailing from the triangle extending from Greece to Afghanistan to Egypt. This Turkish cookbook has her usual great recipes, and has attractive photographs of most of the dishes. However, if you own the above-mentioned ""Complete Middle East..."" you've already got the majority of the recipes, and if you've also got her ""The Complete Mediterranean Cookbook,"" you've got most of the rest. I'm not an authority on Turkish food, but I also sense that ""Turkish Cooking"" is far from encyclopedic. It lacks several of the dishes I've had in Turkish restaurants, including the dessert kazandibi. Bottom line - a nice book for someone interested only in Turkish food, or as a gift to someone you think might like to start cooking Turkish. Otherwise, her previous collections are much better deals."
4,Great for $20,This is a greatg game. The only thing missing is the graphics. Everything else is really good.
5,I don't know what to rate this item!,"This game is great! Lots of fun, awesome graphics, very realistic sound and commentary, etc. The only problems with this game are the minorly sloppy instant replay transitions, and they don't show the names of the opponents on other teams. I would, maybe, give this game a 4, but the good things rule out the bad, for the most part. Still, highly recommended."
5,best hockey game i ever played. way better than nhl 06.,"this game is way better than 06.the graphics are better and the rosters are also more accurate.it is also more realstic.i liked the franchise mode, and the fact that you can control all 30 teams in season mode."
2,"expensive printer, bad scanner especially with wireless","typical expensive inkjet cartridge puts me around 37 cents per copy. If you use the optional wireless adapter, always forgets where to scan to which costs hours of wasted time since all you want is one page but now have to test everything to see whats wrong. Fax is ok and copys ok, but keep in mind if you want anything in color, it can cost in excess of $1 per page for photo quality."
3,ok,"hmm this album reminds me of sigor ros' () album. Anyway this album is short and repeatative, but good I guess."
1,Pathetic,"HA HA HA! No really, HA! Whatever, this is so punk! I've never heard anything so punk! Thanks for the laugh emomix182! HA HA HA!"
5,I Won't Be Alone on My Desert Island,"One: This is one of those rare albums that goes into the small pile entitled, ""CDS FOR YOUR DESERT ISLAND"".Two: It's also an album for those of us who feel deeply and wonder if we're not alone. You're not alone. Listen to this album.This review is coming from a thirty-something who listens to almost 100% instrumental electronic music, not an angst-ridden teen who listens to death-defying rock. That said, this is music for the ages, regardless of genres. Highly recommended to you ""feelers"" out there, but those of you who also require technique to back up the feeling."
4,"Nice music, with only a hint of ""heavy""","I think this music is very emotional, with loads of talented musicianship in the guitar-work. This can be slightly heavy at times, and it also maintains a beautiful overtone to the entire album. The last track is simply stunning. This is worth hearing if you enjoy instrumental music with a ""story-telling vibe""."
4,"Lovely, if you want lovely","This is beautiful music, but post-rockers -- particularly those who prefer the more raucous moments of GYBE, Mogwai etc. -- may initially feel somewhat underwhelmed. This is something altogether prettier, with chiming, brittle guitar lines forming the (fragile) backbone of every track. If Coldplay went prog and Chris Martin stopped singing it might sound like this -- and that's meant to be a compliment, by the way.There are crescendos, of course; there is martial drumming. There are long, meandering tracks. This is definitely post-rock. But it's an altogether more ethereal take on the genre, wistful rather than angst-ridden."
5,Woah,"There are plenty of words that come to mind when listening to this CD. Awash, beauty, melancholy, transcendence... the list rolls on. Unfortunately, these aren't exactly words that can be put together to form sentences, just as the songs of Explosions in the Sky can't easily be translated into a review. This album, as a blurb on the cover says, will destroy anyone who has a soul. Anyone who has been in love, has a heart, or has awoken in the morning feeling like things just might end up okay. The melancholy that the album brings also carries with it an intense feeling of hope, especially in the first song, First Breath After Coma. As it crescendos, one can't help but just feel that things will be alright, and there's something to this life, if we can just get it right. And that's what this album seems to be about; destroying anyone with a soul, and leaving them okay."
2,Disappointingly Formulaic,"I bought this based on all the positive recommendations here on Amazon. I think I need to re-evaluate whether those recommendations should be trusted. This album is very unsophisticated, constantly repeating the same soft-then-loud shtick, attempting to conjure emotion through repetition, and all the other pitfalls that have already been explored by Godspeed You Black Emperor and other post-rock ensembles.Would it kill any of these bands to take their music someplace besides catharsis-land?I kinda dig the slow parts, but the big, sweaty worked-up guitar-churning spots are embarrassing. I feel like taking the musicians aside and saying, ""Hey, you're really spinning your wheels here. Try something else."" But they keep repeating the same mistakes throughout the album, slamming their heads against the wall with masturbatory glee."
3,great but could be better,"My review is one that explosion fans might think i hate them. But i don't i think these guys are great in fact i have all their albums. i downloaded all the songs from the very rare album HOW STRANGE, INNOCENCE in kazaa and sent these guys a check worth how much a cd's worth because of the excellent music. Of all their albums(3) this one is the one that least shines. That's not saying much since the first three tracks are phenomonal. Track two i could play all day long. But after that it kind of slows down. They play simple tracks that made me say "" where is the talent i saw in the previous three tracks and the two other albums""? Overall i recommend everyone to purchase this cd for the first three tracks. These songs are just perfect full of color and soul, few artist have pulled off such great talent off three simple instruments."
5,explosions in my office,"as many of you might have done, i read a couple of amazon reviews, heard some good reports and was consequently extremely curious about this band.I bought this record about 20 minutes ago, and i already feel the need sing its praises. Hopefully this will give a slightly different point of view, being a review in the present, as the album has happened to me for the first time, rather than the usual retrospective account.Just as all these reviews had said (and ill admit, i was slightly sceptical) this music strikes a chord like no other.Im in my office (of all places), only up to track 3, and i have this peculiar internal buzz that hasnt happened for a long time. its on the brink of bursting through me and flooding the room.this band seems to be intricately complex yet compels an amazing amount of immediate impact and attention. the tension is incredible, the music is stunning.post rock has never sounded so full of life."
3,"At first sublime, but after repeated listenings formulaic","At the first listen I was very intrigued by this minimal post rock quartet. The chiming guitars and beautiful arpeggios are quite compelling and mesmerizing. Much of this album could be described as beautiful. Unfortunately after repeated listenings I realized that every song has the same languid tempo, the same time signatures ( 4/4 or 6/8), the same basic dynamic and (simple) melodic structure, the same guitar tone, and they sound as if they were all written in the same key. In fact it's not easy to tell the songs apart from one another. What was at first impressive now sounds formulaic to me. So much so that I found myself saying ""Ok, ok I get it, now do something else."" Good musicians? Undeniably. Good composers? Well... they're not all that."
5,Finally I have a name for it!,"For the longest time I've been calling this stuff Emo or Orchestral Rock. But no! It's 'post-rock'! Phew!This album. Kills. Me. I love it with a distant, rumbling ache in my solar plexus. I promise you will not be sorry for buying this album. It could possibly be one of the most loving things you've done for yourself. Brilliant."
2,A little bored,"I'm sorry, because I know I will offend people. But I bought this because I'm a huge fan of GYBE, Silver Mt Zion, Grails, etc etc... A fan of the genre. But this put me to sleep. Pretty, yes, but in a minimal way. It doesn't divert from its course once. Put it on and sit down to listen to it and you'll find yourself doing other things and hardly noticing when it finishes.I highly, highly recommend 'Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Live Forever' instead. It's a perfect example of what Explosions in the Sky -can- do."
5,Euphoria comes in a case,This album is the most beautiful arrangement of melodic phrases I've ever encountered. The build ups take u further into a sound that makes u feel good. Each song has its own feel.. but same vibe throughout the whole cd.. If u love post rock type music and wanna feel inspired.this is the album for u..
5,A great start for any intrested in the band,"This is the second released, yet officially third album by Explosions in the Sky, and by far their most mature release to date. I say that because you can noticeably tell the difference in playing ability and melody from this to their previous two albums. Musically, they hit it perfectly, the high notes seems to go right with the low notes, and the songs build to an incredible level, and then return to being slow, ambient, and melodic. A work of instrumental beauty, which is perfect to drive to. My favorite part about this album is how it is presented; the whole album can be listened to from start to finish and sound like one flowing piece of music, or the listener can skip to a track without feeling like an inportant part of that song was missed. The orginaization blows my mind, and is truley a work of ""post-rock"" art."
4,An interesting perspective,A daughter researches the life of her mother through the eyes of her mothers friends.
3,Poorly written but it was helpful,"Unfortunately this book was written very poorly. Author swings from one end to another trying to catch a big fish. However she is a good observer and takes you into the complicated relations of four women with their families. She described well each woman during different time periods of their life in China, Taiwan, and USA. Unfortunately, this book consists of many small stories of each of them. There is no main story. However I found it helpful as well."
3,Slowing Down Burke,"AS an avid reader of all the Burke novels I almost fell asleep reading this one. Yes of course Burke met with his family and they got involved with their expertises but all in all something was missing. Unlike other burke novels that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, this one disappointed.Maybe burke is getting older and is starting to question how much more he has in the tank to continue his escapades and hustles. There was a different kind of romance present in this one ( his love didn't die or move to Japan ) with a real huge ""gesture of kindness"" at the end as only could come up with.I say read it anyway, if your as big a fan of Burke as I am, but it was different Burke as far as I'm concerned. Maybe Mr Vachss is maturing Burke into an older and much more wiser street god than any of us expect."
4,Consistent fare,"This is about number 14 in the Burke series.If you like your crime stories cut to the bone these are for you. There is not a word wasted through this book or any of the others. The hero is totally hardboiled and although he can be a bit cartoonish sometimes that is a minor niggle.This is the usual Burke type noir. He and his ""family"" get involved in a situation that leads to a child abuse victim and they resolve the matter,always through violence.The whole series is totally entertaining and ""Chandleresque"" but there are no greys in Burkes world, everything is black or white.This one has him tracking down a runaway he has previously rescued after a client is gunned down in front of him by a professional hit team.Vachss does tend to be a one trick pony with his stories, but his day job is as a children's advocate so it can be expected, but if you have never come across this series try and give them ago. They are all very entertaining."
3,slipping,"Slipping a touch on this one, Andrew appears to be increasing content of his own personality while depleting his characters.Still a good read.Still the greatest subject matter and morals message.Still not available in Australia, but still worth the cost of importing for personal collection."
2,Weakest of the Series,"I am a huge Vachss fan. I really enjoy the Burke series. Mr. Vachss has also had a terrific effect on child abuse and child pornography in this country.That being said, this is the weakest of all of the Burke novels. It gets extremely preachy. He also spends a lot of time reliving events from past Burke books. This may be due to the fact that he changed publishers, but I don't know. All-in-all, I felt this was an OK story but it bogged down in several places and we got lectures instead of action.Oh well, they can't all be great--only most of them.Let's hope ""Terminal"" is back up to his usual stratospheric heights of excellence."
3,Maybe it's me but I was bored...,"For the record, I LOVE Burke. I have been reading this series from the begining, and I have really enjoyed most of them. But this last one felt like the odd one out of the bunch, and didn't seem to fit in with his normal ""saving a child"" books. I hope in the next one coming out in Septemeber, that he goes back to Burke's roots."
4,Works toooo good.,"I found myself in the same boat as some other people on here, i hadn't ever used decalcifier, and used it and it clogged my machine. I ran it again and was able to get it to unclog, and now it works better than it ever has!"
3,Good but there are cheaper alternatives,"After purchasing a Delonghi Magnifica 3300 superautomatic espresso machine, I decided to stock up on descaling solution. Prices seem to vary quite a bit without and real difference in quality or ease of use. This was the best price I could find online for descaler until I went to Williams Sonoma one day. There they sell a single bottle which has enough solution for two descaling runs for about half the price of this product. I will admit that having two bottles is easier when measuring out the correct amount of fluid but I wouldn't say it's worth another $6 or $7.This is a very good product at a very good price but I'm cheap so I'm going to stick with the Delonghi branded solution from Williams Sonoma."
4,Expresso Decalcifier,Durgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier was purchased at a fair price. So far it has worked well in our Delongi machine.
3,Fancy,"I use this for my espresso maker, and I use the cheaper dry mix for my drip coffee maker. Impossible to tell if the extra cost is worth it, but compared to the price of my espresso maker, I use this. In time i expect to switch to the cheaper version."
3,Utility product -- does what it says ....,"If there's one minor irritant with fancy coffeee makers, it's their tendency to get clogged up. You have to decalcify them. That's what this does. It works. I guess it's just the cost of doing coffee!Durgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier"
1,No more Lattes for me,"I had owned my pump-driven Espresso machine for a year before I decided to try this product.I followed the instructions exactly as specified. But after use I started getting chunks of brown stuff.I was hoping the brown stuff would disappear after running just water through it and so I tried running water through it for as many as 10-15 times, but that did not fix the issue. So, instead of taking the risk I threw out my Espresso machine."
1,This stuff simply DOES NOT WORK!!!,"Buy something else, This stuff is junk. Just another poor product that tries to sell itself as ""green."" Sheesh! Save you mo"
1,Very Disappointing,Very expensive for one use. Thought we might have got at least 3 - 4 uses out of a bottle. Not have to use the full bottle in one go. Will not be buying it again in a hurry. Works out very expensive.
4,Easy Decalcifier,"This product is good for any calcium-clogged, small diameter tube, as in a espresso maker....my coffee maker was so clogged that I thought I'd be in for a very expensive repair. After using this product, my coffee maker is working like it never has. The only problem with the product is that it is slightly caustic and one needs to run lots of water through the system to get the taste out of it."
5,World's Best and Fastest Decalifier Ever,Forget about that Lime Away stuff....takes way too long to work. Got this product for my Capresso Teakettle (which I just love) and when the heating element becomes covered with water calcification...this stuff removes it in a second. Rinses clean too unlike Lime Away which leaves some product residue behind no matter how many times I rinse my teakettle. Don't have an espresso machine but see by the reviews that it works stupendously for that also. Just read the directions...couldn't be simplier.
5,works great,This product cleaned my barista perfectly. My only complaint was the cost of the shipping. It was more than the cleaner.
5,Product performed just as intended and lived up to my expectations,"Not much to say about this product. I have a fully automatic espresso machine and when it builds up scale in the machine it calls for a de-scaling product. This is the product that the manufacturer recommended and it has worked beautifully every time I have had to use it, which is about once every six months or so."
3,Beware on granite surfaces,"I used this descaler on my Tassimo machine. I worked fine and I am sure did the trick.I wanted to write this review to warn everyone out there that this product will stain your granite counter tops. I had no idea. I set the bottle on my black granite and later found a stain in the shape of the ring left behind from the solution. Needless to say that I am totally bummed and saddened that my granite is ruined. If anyone knows how to fix this problem, please let me know!Thanks."
5,Works Like Magic!!!,This solution saved my espresso machine (the espresso stream had literally slowed to a trickle)! Just one bottle was enough to restore it to like-new condition. Now I'm finally able to make the same frothy espresso I made when I took my machine out of the box.
5,Absolutely Awesome Almonds,This great snack is packaged in a perfect portion and in a bag that makes it easy to tuck away in a purse or briefcase. Provides both a quick pick-me-up and staying power when you need nutrients in a hurry that will hold you for a while.
2,Little slow for my taste...not a good sign for short stories.,This book has some decent stories but moves along at a snail's pace. There are too many ridiculous proper names to keep up with...it's just not that interesting. I don't regret reading it...just wish he could have kept my attention better.
3,"great product, bad service","We were very happy with the t shirt, but it took two weeks to receive the product, shipping was very slow for the price"
1,worst support ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought to write my negative review but Jeremy P. Seda ""CEO of XMS, Inc."" said it all! In fact I don't even have to change the dates! I am experiencing EXACTLY the same problms. Thanks Jeremy. Now all I can do is to express my anger and frustration posting my negative reviews on all major websites.Want to be as frustrated as I am? Go ahead and buy Toshiba laptops!"
3,Third volume of six,"All of BUENA VISTA's ""Cartoon Capers"" videotapes clock in at under a half hour, with only three animated shorts per edition. Two of these are Fleischer brothers works, one is from PARAMOUNT's Famous cartoon division.This third offering in the series (subtitled ""Babes and Beasts"") features:THE COBWEB HOTEL (1936) - Newlywed flies are trapped in their honeymoon suite by Mr. Spider.THE STORK MARKET (1949) Singalong released in the early post-war years of the Baby Boom.THE LITTLE STRANGER (1936) - Based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""Ugly Duckling"" fable.RELATED ITEM:CARTOON CAPERS, VOL. 4has these animations: ""An Elephant Never Forgets,"" ""Toys Will Be Toys"" and ""To Spring!"""
2,perfect for,"this book is perfect for people who have no idea what this religion is about and what it stands for. it says three or four things about the ceremonies and what is awaiting the people that arent already initiated into the religion. if you already know all these steps and are looking for something more complex, i do not recommend it."
2,bias,"This is a nicely written book, although I do not know if it's factual or not, due to the author's stance today. I think something of credibility is lost by stating at the start that you no longer believe in this faith yourself, as the author has. I'd like to find a book on this subject that is written by an author who still embraces the faith."
3,Interesting,I picked up this book recently. The cover caught my eye so I decided to read it. I have to say that I was more impressed with the cover than I was with the content of the book. The author gives an over abundance of charts and correspondance tables and not really any information which hasn't already been discussed in other books. The author also appears to have taken some correspondance tables from another book called THE HANDBOOK OF YOUROBA RELIGOUS CONCEPTS by Baba Ifa Karade and did not credit Baba Karade in his bibliography. I gave this book three stars because it seems to present some information which someone interested in Santeria might find usefull but once one moves beyond mere interest this book is obsolete.
4,Pretty good Almonds,"These are good almonds with the tamari flavor, nice and crisp. The packages are a little small but, all in all a good size to put in your pocket for a snack. I would order them again."
2,"the sentiment is tight,but not the song itself",all prayers to Luther Vandross for a Full Recovery&also He is One of the Best Vocalists over the past 25 years easily.anyway the sentiment of the Song is felt but the song itself leaves me kinda empty.
3,tiny princess,smaller than typical SW figurines/action figures. paint is blotchy on hands and gun looks massive in comparison to her. her arms move at the shoulders and her head rotates....that's it. the gown does have nice detail though. not the best leia of the lot.
4,Harpsichord hits from the 18th Century,"This CD offers a sampling of harpsichord music from some of the foremost composers of the Baroque era. It's a great starting point if you want to expand your horizons beyond Bach and sample music from some of the other composers of the day. Since the songs aren't listed in Amazon's description, I've included an image of the track listing. Also, please note that this is a single CD... not a two-CD set."
1,Don't spend your money on this book,There are better books out there to spend your money on. The copy I have was printed in 1993 and a lot of things have changed since this first edition.It is useless for individual traders.You would be better off to buy John Murphy's books; Mark Douglas' books and John L. Person's book.Just my humble opinion.
3,Trading Currency Cross Rates : Proven Trading Strategies from a Leading International Currency Trader and a Noted Expert on Futu,"Good book for a feel on cross-rates. Unfortunately written before the advent of the EURO, therefore partially osolete nowadays."
1,Very Biased..Anti-Albanian Book,"As a writer, I would have assumed this author to have written a more in depth explanation on his finding. But, No, I didn't not see that. The book is very biased and doesn't really explain the views from a muti-national views. Mostly from the Balkan views."
5,Great Product - if you can get past the parts list,"I assembled this over 4 hours one weekend. Actually, you could do this in less than half the time if they had provided a decent parts checklist. To verify a part, you had to go to the page in the assembly instructions to find out what the part looks like -it would have been nice to have a diagram of all the parts separate from the assembly instructions. Other than that, it assembled well, is a real quality product and we've had hours of fun."
4,We Like It,"My husband and I put it together in a few hours. I thought the instructions were fine. It's not as sturdy as I would like, but maybe it would be better if we used sand instead of water."
5,Satisfied,I purchased this item as a gift for my son. I was very happy with this item and the shipment time was quick.
3,"10/29/07 Review of TracFone Prepaid Airtime Card, raycla@msn.com UPDATED 12/16/06","PLEASE NOTE; AS OF 10/29/07, TRACfONE HAD NOT REINSTATED THE REFER-A-FRIEND PROGRAM. It is looking more and more unlikely that TracFone will NOT be giving away free minutes for such a program!!! THEREFORE, PLEASE DISREGARD THE REMAINDER OF THIS REVIEW!!!(Since TracFone Airtime can be purchased online as well as in the form of cards in major drugstores and ""big box"" stores, there should be no rush to buy minutes until you have used 120 Free Minutes you can get BEFORE ACTIVATION of your ""fone"" if you e-mail me to request the REFER A FRIEND e-mail which you will use to activate your fone and be eligible for 120 Free Minutes. You MUST HAVE THIS E-MAIL from me or someone else PRIOR TO ACTIVATING YOUR TRACFONE. PLease do NOT make the mistake made by a few people who activate their fone and then contact me too late. My e-addr is in subject line of this review)."
4,Yes; unusual work for an undertaker!,"One of the best Campion stories. This one has an original plot, which wasn't apparent to me for quite some time. The characters in it are perhaps not drawn as well as in some of her others, which for me can raise a typical detective story up to the level of good literature. Still; it's a good story."
1,Stop Working,"The Bulbs looked good, but one of them stopped working withing a week. The other bulb stopped working a couple of days after that!"
4,City Boy on CD ?,"WOW! I never thought I would see the day. I had always suspected I was not the only City Boy fan on the planet, but it sure felt that way. I have only met three people in my life who had ever even heard of them. The first was that guy who turned me on to them in 82. (Just after we all traded our 8 Tracks for Cassettes) The other is my brother, whom I introduced. The third, is me. Nice to see all the comments here on Amazon. I no longer feel alone! It took me five years to collect all 6 of the City Boy records. All from various used record outlets. The CD versions are a most welcome purchase ""City Boy Lives!"" Oh. My favorite City Boy song? ""Moving in Circles"" from the Book Early album. Peace."
3,enjoyable but...,"Definately a Frenchman in his consumate appreciation of language. If I didn't know any better, I'd say I was reading someone with the playful rollercoaster verbosity of a Gilles Deleuze only with a more metaphysical slant. Unfortunately the book comes across more as an ego trip than an ego transcendance but who's to be the judge in these matters? How do you critically evaluate a mystic, when you are not awakened? Instict, intuition? Perhaps. Jourdain speaks about the ineffable with an admixture of nihilism, dizzy poetic baroque language and literary vigor. The only evident thing here is the man can talk! Don't expect anything else -It's HOPELESS!!"
4,Fascinating,"This is a fascinating account and dialogue of a person who self-awakened. For anyone interested in the process of ""enlightenment"" this is a must read. I especially recommend this to those interested in the nondual approach."
2,Not what I expected,"The bed is comfortable but in less that a week, it started to spring leaks in the seams. We use the bed in a manner in which it was intended, yet it seems to be a poorly designed product. For the amount of money that I spent I expected it to be higher quality. I am over all disappointed in this bed."
1,too many problems,"i have purchased this bed, and had to return it 4 times.it looses air, the sides blow out and the top blows out.the only reason i still have this bed is because i purchased the extended warranty, so i could get it replaced [4 times]"
1,"Defective, but only visible after 30 days","After 4 month of usage, the product developed a small hole in one of the stitches, clearly due to poor manufacturing.As it was small, it took a couple of hours until we hit the ground. The worse night of my life!After applying the patch supplied, the stitches continued to deteriorate and, eventually, it was impossible to apply another patch because the rip was just too large."
5,Quilling Rocks,"Must add this book to your arts and crafts library, easy to follow projects, wonderful ideas, and the finished work is just beautiful,you can't wait to hear from those you share it with."
3,Would I buy this book again?,"The short answer is no, if I had seen the book in the store, I would have put it back on the shelf, not because its a 'bad buy', but more because it didn't cover what I use quilling for and thats card making. There are some lovely projects to do, but unless you are well experienced in the art of quilling they are not for the beginner. Having said that, I would say that I really enjoyed the first section of the book about how to quill ."
4,Paper Quilling for the First Time,"Being new to quilling, I found the instructions contained in this book to be very clear and the colored illustrations were most helpful. The illustrations also gave me ideas which go beyond merely making flowers, etc. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the age old art of quilling. Fran - Brooklyn, Michigan"
4,Good vocab prep,"I found the High frequency words pretty useful, and I think these words only matter anyway. Only I find carrying the flash cards and flashing them around a pain, and they write GEEK all over me. I actually found this cool application that works on the cell phone and has tough GRE words. Google with ""GRE tough words"" to find it. Best part I liked about it was that the words are on-the-mark and app is well designed for cell phone use."
5,kelly rocks!!!!!!!!,"these songs are great and definately better than most ""pop"" music out there today!"
1,The Trouble with Imports is,WHY? Why whould you pay $13 for two songs? Imports are way too costly...
5,COOL!,"I LOVE Pollies! They are always so good! And just take a look at this mat! There is a pavement and a beach and shops and houses for friends and you could put clothes galore on the little hang-rails! It is SOOO fun! I love to make my tamagotchi live on it! The mat smells really lovely on the back! I am starting to think that it is purposely scented! I have seen LOADS of Jackie's reviews but she does boring reviews. They are not EXCITING enough! I ADORE this mat! It is especially cool if you get the Polly swimming pool! I ADORE the swimming pool but I won't skip to describing another toy! All I can say is; GET THIS TOY! You honestly won't be dissapointed! SO MANY THINGS TO DO! My pollies adore it! Hope this review helps, Bye!"
2,They didn't specify that the box had been run over.,They failed to inform that the box had been run over by a heard of elephants and then taped back together again. I haven't needed to use the labels yet so I am unsure of the condition of the contents. Stay tuned for a later update.
4,Great for 8th grade American history teachers,"Even though this movie has a setting change from the book and takes place in Canada, it is a realistic portrayal of what life was like for ladies who worked in factories during the Industrial Revolution. It brought it to life in a way that kept my student's interest. I highly recommend taking the two days to show it."
2,The Book is Better!,Lyddie is a movie based on the book written by Katherine Paterson. The movie changes the location of the mills! I can't believe that the movie doesn't have Lowell in it. There were so many changes to the story that it became distracting when watching the movie. Anyone who has read the book will not enjoy the movie because it does not do justice to the book.
2,OK but better products on market,"Installed product on 30 feet of gutters. The rest of the gutters I used the black ""foam"" product sold by COSTCO. The black ""foam"" product is much better. The gutter brush allows a lot of debris to accumulate on roof and on top of gutters and it looks messy as well as debris has gotten into the gutters. The COSTCO product has worked flawlessly and i intend on replacing the gutter brush with it very soon."
1,gutter overflow,company stands behind it's product. worth trying!Wouldn't let me give it more stars when I tried to edit my review.
2,Really Beautiful Earrings but very Heavy,I really liked these earrings but they are so heavy I can't wear them.I think the metal chosen was of a less than perfect metal...meaning extra cheap.Don't buy these earrings unless you like the idea of your ear being ripped open at any given moment.
5,good and long!,"This anime series is one of the best I've seen so far. Like a lot of people, i've seen all 95 (yes, ninety-five) episodes of Rurouni Kenshin. And if the US release didn't screw up the story, all 95 episodes are important to the series. The reason I like this series is because there's a sort of character development, and you meet each character at different times throughout the episodes. Rather than everyone knowing everyone in the beginning, and getting confused about who is who, you'll find out something about each person's past. Although it's a long series, it's worth watching all those episodes, and so far all my friends loved it too. Just watch the first few episodes, and see how you like it!"
2,This or nothing...,"The print of ""Three Word Brand"" comes from a source many generations from the original. Image is washed out and soft. Hard to watch. Transferred at the correct speed, but every few minutes, for two to three seconds, the image slows then accelerates before settling back to the correct speed. The musical score is astonishingly inappropriate. But, until a better source comes along (soon, please!), this is the only option to see this spectacular late William S. Hart feature. I didn't look at ""The Square Deal Man"" as there is already a superior alternate edition on the market. Again, it's Alpha Video roulette to see what you get."
3,Movie buffs history.,"Bought this because I remember my dad saying that his favorite western star was William S. Hart and I wanted to see why he liked him. Enjoyed ""Three Word Brand"" but couldn't get through ""Square Deal Man"" because it was very hard to watch (picture went out of focus, skipped a lot, big spots on screen). I know the quality can't be up to par, but it is fun seeing westerns before talkies and stars like Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele (my favorite)."
1,Stay away from this book,"Awful. One of the most poorly organized travel guides I've ever been duped into buying. Restaurants and hotels are jumbled together for entire regions so as to be rendered useless (not that the reviews were useful anyway); I'd spend twenty minutes just trying to figure out where in the book Halifax was! There are, unbelievably, no city or town introductions whatsoever (you have no way of deciding where to go, which is the whole point of having a travel guide). Although there is some worthwhile information about campsites and kayaking, in general, the writing is uniformly poor, the judgments undiscriminating, and the information out of date. I threw it away to save car space. Don't make the same mistake as me."
5,He's back!,"At first listen, I hated, hated, HATED this album. But that's probably just a testament to the fact that it doesn't lend itself well to a ""quick listen"", like most of his better work.It's now the favorite in my expansive Z. collection.Think of it as ""Mutineer"" but with more kick to it."
2,Only for the hardcore fan,"If you aren't a dyed in the wool Zevon fan... skip this CD. Even if you are a hardcore Zevon fan, be warned. Warren has evolved into a very strange man (well, I guess he started that way). I wasn't sure where he was going with the Mutineer and I sure am lost with this latest enterprise. I don't get the yodeling. And the subject matter is such that I have to hide sharp objects lest I decide to end it all. For most of humanity, I recommend his anthology or the live CD."
2,Dylan is secure,"No sense mincing words,I wouldn't buy this. Warren,try again,this time with a bit more of what I call,the right stuff. More feeling,real feelings!!"
2,I've seen better,"I must say I was disappointed to see the lame and profane lyrics on this CD. Nevertheless, being the WZ fan that I am I bought it and am still disappointed. The words in most of the songs are cheap, uncreative, and I believe I could have written them better. However, the music in a few songs such as I was in the House When the House Burned Down, Porcelain Monkey Back in the High Life Again is quite good. A few down sides to this are Porcelain Monkey sounds just like Seminole Bingo, Hostage-O sounds an awful lot like Mutineer and the best song on the CD, Back in the High Life Again, wasn't even written by WZ. If you are interested in WZ I would suggest his Anthology, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, or anything from his first CD, Wanted Dead or Alive to Sentimental Hygiene. Anything after these would probably be a waste of money. I'm sorry to say it, but WZ has gone down hill."
4,"a tremendous effort, excellent!",He started out making a demo tape and now has a monster hit on his hand
5,His hair is perfect,"I can't recommend this one enough. If you've liked him before, you will again. ""Life Will Kill Ya"" is a collection of twisted, funny and pained songs. One is a lovely little tune, for example, until you realize it's about how the singer wants a S&M hostage thing instead of loneliness. An illusion-free rip on Elvis. An attack on religion. A couple of songs you can't play with the kids around.In the middle is a spare, wry reading of ""Back in the High Life Again,"" sung by a character so desperate you know he has no hope of the high life again.The last word is from his press packet. Why are the arrangements so simple?""At some point,"" Zevon said, ""I insisted on keeping the production down to a level to where I could faithfully recreate the album alone in saloons in Korea when my career goes down the toilet."""
4,"Zevon's ""Nebraska""?","I hated this disc the first time I heard it. I thought it sounded underproduced, as if the record company had simply released a batch of demos. But this is an album that reveals itself on subsequent listens. The spare production actually works in the songs' favor, making them more direct and personal, and putting me a bit in mind of Bruce Springsteen's ""Nebraska."""
5,Zevon doing what he does best...being honest to his music,"I just got his new album and just have listened to it twice. Two warnings for new listeners, get his earlier works first (i.e. Exciteable Boy) and two don't base everything you think of him on 'Werewolves'. This album is full power Zevon, crass, ironic, and smart. I don't think it's for a first time listener as much, but if you loved his other albums, you will love this one!"
4,The incomparable Warren Zevon never disappoints.,The incomparable Warren Zevon does it again.I never expect to be disappointed by Warren's work and again I was right.He was one of the GREATS. I miss him but his MUSIC and SPIRIT will live on forever.Buy this record. You won't be sorry. Every ZEVON record is worth the price.
4,...but this cd'll thrill ya.,"Astonishing album. Clever, dark, funny. As soon as I heard it I wanted to play it for half my friends -- the cool half. In an era of teenage superstars making Mickey Mouse music, this is an album for adults. Highlights are definintely the title track, ""For my next trick I'll need a volunteer"" (a brilliant meditation on failed love and selfishness), track #9 (too dirty to list here) and a moving, melancholy reinterpretation of ""Back in the High Life."" Frankly, there's not a weak song here. My only regret is that more people haven't heard this cd. Recommended for long time Zevon fans and newcomers alike."
2,UGH! the details,"I am a huge lover of air disaster books. For some reason, I never heard about this one until just recently.Now, I think I know why! While this book may appeal to people ""in the airline business"", for me, as a layperson I found it to be one of the most boring books I have ever read. This is suppose to be some kind of thriller, but this book gets stuck in so much detail after detail that I completely gave up reading after page 126.What a boring book. Stay away from this one."
1,400 how many.,What made the author think he could fill up over 400 pages with this sensationalized pile of hooey? Did he get any form of technical advice?
5,The best depiction of ATC I've seen!!,"As an air traffic controller who has worked in a Tracon for the last 12 years I find this book to be the most realistic portrayal of the business that I have ever read. This man has done his homework!! I could not find a single fault in his technological account of ATC! Reading the book during my breaks at work was like being in two dimensions. It was as if he was sitting in the room with me as I worked. He got it right from the inane comments to the adrenaline rush of an arrival push!!I'll be pushing this book on all my family and friends who just can't seem to understand what it is that I do all day. This book put the movie ""Pushing Tin"" to shame!!"
3,Air Traffic Controllers research was good,"In the real world of Air Traffic Control, problems that lead to near misses or collisions usually do so without a controllers knowledge. If he/she saw them coming they would prevent them from happening. Most near near misses, or seperation errors happen in periods of low traffic when the controller is focusing on conversations with others, not on the traffic. I liked your other book, AGAINST THE WIND better. I would love to see someone do a full accounting of the actual cost President Reagan put on the backs of the tax payers over the years for not giving the striking controllers a thirty day suspension vs. termination. It would be billions.Written by an air traffic controller, retired"
4,Great for what it is...,This is a book about a fictitious air traffic controller... as a controller i felt that it is very realistic and keeps you on the edge of your seat as well... must read for any aviation enthusiast!
4,"Good reading, especially for us pilots.","Accurate depiction of air traffic control at it's busiest. I enjoyed the story very much, McElroy keeps the pace quick throughout. As a pilot I appreciated the attention to detail."
4,Holy moley!,"As a female-type person I thought, whoppee, a techno-thriller. But, wait! There's more! Much more. Yes, yes, it's about death in the sky -- everybody's greatest fear. But there's also a pretty captivating plot going on down on planet Earth, too. Steamy, you might say. AND, girl or no, you got planes smashing into each other over one of our Great Lakes and body bits dropping like pidgeon poop, you got a plot that won't let go. Really. Trust me. You'll be thrilled. Good for the beach. Um, probably don't want to read on a plane trip. Save for beach."
5,Real Value,This company sells quality products at unbelievably low prices. This particular product (melatonin) works just as well as much more expensive competitors.
4,bought for avid car care,"This was bought for a Christmas present for my husband. I admit I knew nothing about these devices when I bought his, however he loves it and says it is exactly what he needed, with out the manual it is worthless though the bestpart is that if the book is lost in the garage there is a code look up for this model on the internet!! good fail safe!"
4,home mechanic,"The tool worked very well and was easy to use. It diagnosed the problem, I was able to correct it and the tool cleared the warning light. I am very satisfied with the purchase."
1,DIAGNOSTIC CODE READER,"THE PRODUCT WORKS FINE, HOWEVER, I NEEDED A TOOL THAT WOULD READ MORE THAN JUST EMMISSION ISSUES, (ELECTRICAL IRREGULARITIES, AIR CONDITIONING AND MODULE ERRORS, ETC.SO THIS ORDER WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, NOR DID THE ADVERTISMENT INDICATE THE PRODUCTS SHORT COMINGS.BUYER BEWARE.THANKS."
2,No cobertura en Europa,"El producto presenta buen estado y en principio funciona correctamente, salvo que los automoviles probados Opel Zafira, Hyundai Trajet se conecta al protocolo de la ECU pero no muestra los diferentes monitores activos. Solo tienen servicio tecnico para EEUU y Canada. El resto nos quedamos sin cobertura Web."
5,Equus = Easy To Use!,"I'm a lady over 50 and don't know squat about cars, but I hooked this baby up and found out why my engine light was on. It was a quick easy fix. Now the whole family is standing in line to use it."
5,Equus 3100 Innova CanOBD2,"I purchased the Equus Innova because my friend needed a secon opinnion about a code he was getting. This tool turned out to be great, because it not only gave the correct code, but it also offered us unsight too the correct fix. I could also reset the computer once we were done with the repair. It's a tool that anyone can use, to repair your own vehicle."
4,Saved money first time around,"I finally bit the bullet and bought an OBD tester. I hooked it up to my Prius and had an error code in minutes. After a brief search on the web (I didn't splurge for the online car trouble shooting from Equus ) I figured out it was my o2 sensor. Bought a new part and had it replaced in about an hour. The tester and new part cost me about $170, which I'm sure is less than it would have been to go to the dealer. So, this device has already paid for itself.I was also able to hook it up to my Ford Flex. It seemed to connect just fine as well."
4,Great product only 1 problem,"I love the product right out or the box. I was able to diagnose the problem without needing to take the car to the dealership. My ony problem was that when I received it from Amazon, the CD was cracked so it doesn't work. So I don't know what is on the CD. So far, I havent figured out how to get Amazon's attention as to how to get it replaced."
3,I like it,It work fine for me I can recommend this equipment to friends and and other people who interested.But I will be buying the more advance one soon.
4,Doesn't work with 1996 Mazdas,"I purchased this unit to diagnose a check engine light on my 1996 Mazda Miata, but the unit was unable to retrieve a code. After contacting the company's support line, I found out that it has known problems with Mazdas made around then.Not necessarily the fault of Equus -- Mazda may not have implemented the OBD-II protocol correctly early on. Either way, it doesn't work on 1996 Mazdas. I've heard good things from other owners of this code reader, so I'm still giving it a good score."
4,"Nice Scanner, but","The scanner tool itself was very easy to use and worked great. It shows the diagnostic codes and a bunch of other info. However, I thought the software that came with it was rather pointless. It does not tell you anything that is not on the scan tool itself. If you want to find out what the codes mean in the real world and what the probable cause and solutions are, you have to purchase that for an extra fee (or look it up online). Overall though, I am still glad I bought it. I was able to fairly easily figure out what the problem was without any additional purchase."
5,Software Can Be Updated,"I decided to go this model instead of 3030 because the software can be updated via Windows-Base PC which is great for future cars. It was worth the extra cost. Install the included CD and connect the supply cable and it will update automatically. The Emmission Test LED is another great future on this model. If you don't pass this, then your car is not ready for a smog test. Very easy to use. If I had to buy again, I would get the 3130 because of the O2 Sensor Test. Not a big deal since I use my digital multimeter for this."
4,Works,"Payed for itself the first time I used it. Found the codes. Looked it up. Replaced the parts myself. Used on a Dodge truck and Honda Civic so far. I know you can rent or borrow, but it is handy to have your own on hand. Used internet to look up codes. Book is limited."
5,Money saver,"When my ""Check Engine"" light came on, I thought I'd need to have my mechanic check it out. I called and found out that he charges $140 just to do the diagnostic part. That is, plug in a reader to the car's computer and find out what is wrong. My son was visiting, and he said he had a tool to read the computer, and it didn't cost that much. We found this Equus 3100 on Amazon, and it was the same one he had. We found a split vacuum hose near the EGR valve and replaced it. Then we plugged the Equus 3100 into the car, checked the computer and turned the Check Engine light off using the reader. It has been fine since, and it cost me about half what I would have paid the mechanic. Now I have the reader for future problems on any vehicle. Good thing to have!"
2,It should have come with a booklet of code answers.,"It should have come with a booklet of code answers. It makes you sign up for their internet website and misleads you in thinking that it will give you answers from the computer for 1 month. You still have to manually input the VIN number and Code to get an answer. On top of this, they try to make you pay for a premium service for additional information. Do you want to pay $100.00 dollars for this and continue to pay for additional service agreement?"
2,I might have missed it but.....,"Well the tool was and is okay but I had issues with trying to get it installed on my computer. It seems it was an issue with Fire Fox being my ISP. Then once I get it running, I find out I have to pay $14.00 to see the cost and break down of the repairs I could do as well as what to expect to be charged from a mechanic if I brought it to them? Had I know that, I would have tried carMD first. I thought I was paying for the software to give me the breakdown once on line but now find this hidden charge."
3,Just returned unit...No lighted keypad!,"Well to start, this unit seemed well built. Has a little weight to it so I think its built good. I only used it once because it has one poor design issue. ""IT DONT LIGHT UP""..no lighted led screen monitor? Like doin a etch a scetch in the old days. lol...All fairness they left it out so you would buy the higher models I guess. Strange part is most of the cheap readers this company makes seem to have lighted displays.I live in an area were its dark at 5pm in the colder part of the yr. I need light. If you dont have sight issues or if you dont care if you have to hold a flash light while looking at codes then go for it...I returned it and bought the 1403. It does more anyway. If you do get the upper models be prepared to get a RS232 to USB adapter plug for them. Not sure why these are not updated to USB? Hope this helps...most people dont seem to care about the light but it makes such a big difference."
3,"It gives the codes, but thats all!","I bought this because we have 2 older cars and dont really forsee a reason to buy a new one right now. I do most of the maintence work on the cars since things are tight. It gives the codes, but if you want a frezze frame or a PC printout, you will need to register at the company's website. Forget the disk that comes with the reader, its worthless."
3,Works,"I was using a protocol converter that uses a laptop or Palm Pilot to display the data. This method worked very well and was straightforward and easy to use. The protocol converter allows you to see anything that the car's processor was capable of sending to the OBD-II connector. I purchased the Equus 3100 because my protocol converter needed a serial interface to work with a laptop and newer laptops do not have serial port as standard options, plus my older Palm was having problems. The Equus works, but it is not very intuitive or very user friendly and the display has low resolution. I should have spent the money on a new protocol converter from Harrison R&D. I plan on buying a new protocol converter scan tool from Harrison R&D."
3,"Reader Good, Case is not",I got the Equus OBD II Code Reader with Storage Casebecause I like to protect the equipment I get but the case is just an empty plastic box. I had to make my own foam liner to keep the reader from bouncing around and damaging itself.
2,Equus 3100,"I have read all the reviews before purchasing this item and found nothing but good reviews, however, my review is less than stellar. Out of the box the unit looks nice. I read the manual and went through the procedures. First off the unit won't go into the menu mode no matter what I do. The procedure seem simple enough. Just won't go! Secondly the video on the attached CD plays with sound, but no video. Bummer!!! Thirdly there is no mention what so ever in the manual about the USB connector and what your supposed to do for updates. What a joke!!! I haven't hooked it up to a vehicle yet...... I don't want to be more disappointed than I already am. My $39 cheapie OBDII is easier to work than this is!"
2,falta el software del producto,Lamentablemente no recibi el software y no puedo acceder a la aplicación del prodcuto en mi pc y tampoco lo puedo actualizar. agradeceria si me pueden colaborar con esto.
3,Equus 3100 Innova Diagnostic Tool,This product works fine to read vehicle trouble codes. It will not read trouble codes for the ABS brake system. Firmware is available from the product makers website.
5,Best money I ever spent for my car!,"I bought this because it was the third time my check engine light came on in my 2005 Kia Rio. The first time was covered by warranty, the second time the dealer claimed an animal had chewed through a wire for an air sensor and charged me $400 to repair it. When it came on again I decided to try to figure it out myself. Well, I got this wonderful little machine and hooked it up and found out I just needed to add engine coolant. I'm so happy that I can now check out my car before I take it to the repairman so I can't get overcharged for repairs I don't need. This machine not only tells you the code but also a brief explanation so you know what's wrong right away. It's so easy to use. Just attach it to the car and turn the key! It even turned off the check engine light after I got the code."
3,Received unit fine but price dropped at my local auto store after purchased and I ended up overpaying slightly through Amazon.,"So far the unit has not picked up any fault codes but I cannot fault the system yet, The car computer does not register an error code (despite the engine running roughly) so therefore I can't really expect the Innova Unit to provide feedback on what was never registered by the car's onboard computer. The unit looks well constructed and hopefully will be as good as other units on the market in the $100.00-$120.00 range."
5,Great Product!,It was received quickly and well packaged. My husband tried it out and loved it. Seems to do everything we expected it to do.
3,A good product for the money.,"I paid about $70 for this ODB II reader on a promotion that Amazon ran. The product does the job it is supposed to with out a lot of bells and whistles. I was able to quickly connect the unit and read the fault code from the car in about 30 seconds.The documentation is a bit shakey -- it doesn't state much about using the product while the car is running. Also, it doesn't let you clear out the car's fault without clearing out its own memory. The only way to save code information is to make a printout from the PC application (and there is no 'save' option in the PC application to store the data on your hard drive)."
4,innovia obd2,"this is a very good tool for the money, it comes with all the cables and software to connect to your computer, I did not like the way their software used a web based link that repuired you to enter your vin number and plate number for you car and limit it to 3 autos, I made a complaint to customer service for Innovia and they sent me a different version that is computer based.I would recommend this to anyone, I hope they change the added software.Rich"
5,Equus 3100 Innova Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII,"For me the Backyard mechanic it's great. I like toys and to me this is a nice toy to have, With some time and practice it become easy to use, I installed the software and did the update and headed for my van and truck, I plugged it in the van and then to the USB port on my laptop and it gave all the (CAN)info with the car running, the software is pretty good too. Over all it's good for that Backyard mechanic kind of dude!Equus 3100 Innova Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII"
1,Why I gave it only 1 star......,"I've never owned a scan tool and bought this one because of this statement in the advertising: This powerful and rugged tool quickly reveals the cause of ""Check Engine"" light warnings on any 1996 and newer car, light truck, or SUV--foreign and domestic. (and because of good reviews)I have a 1999 VW Beetle and it Does Not work at all on it. It worked just fine on my 2008 Chevy Equinox, but I wanted it mainly for my Bug. That's why I gave it 1 star - because their statement is not true. It does NOT work on ANY 1996 or newer cars and it really irritates me when something is falsely advertised.Had I bought it just for my Equinox, I would have given it 5 stars as it worked with no problem at all and was very easy to use.If you are a VW owner - don't buy it."
4,Much better than others I've used,"Would have given it a 5-star, but the button markings aren't as obvious as expected. Having the rext readout with the code is a huge plus, saving me the time to look up the codes.It's easy to use out of the box. Found a better price on Amazon than WalMart."
5,Does the Job and Inexpensive,"The Equus 3100 has all the features a home user needs, is easy to use and works as advertised while being inexpensive. Common codes are built into the device along with all codes being accessible via the internet. It saved me a service visit by showing that my problem was a fouled spark plug."
4,code reader,Equus 3100 Innova Diagnostic Code Reader with Memory Backup for OBDII (Post-1996) VehiclesEasy to set up & use The info is valuable for dealing with your dealer!
4,Is it worth it,"I am thrilled with the proformance of this scanner. Initally I was concerned if it would perform and be understandable. It does super well, and is capable to a lot more than I was aware of. Yep, good buy. Service was outstanding. Arrived on time and ready to go. Good communications, and service."
5,Excellent Tool for DIY Mechanic,"Product worked as advertised. At half the cost of a single diagnostic test, this was a bargain. While not specific to any auto manufacturer, this unit does supply you with helpful codes. Although I have only used it twice to date, knowing what error codes the computer is sending is helpful, especially if the fix is something the do-it-yourselfer is able to fix on his/her own. It can reset the 'check engine' light as well, which not all OBC II instruments are capable of doing."
5,Does a great job,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do.......have used it on several of my cars and friends cars and so far, it has given me great data."
1,Don't waste your money,"It does give you code but the website does not give you any ""free"" explanations. The promoted solution would not accept my credit card so I have no other comment. I would not buy again."
4,Gets the job done,Purchased this to check code that was suspect instead of going to dealer. Saved myself the cost of dealer (several hundred dollars) which paid for this unit many times over. Only issue is it erases code from unit as well as vehicle.
2,problems linking,Does not link with all japanese import vehicles. Difficulty in finding updates online to link with.
4,saved me time and money,"Better than what's used by the national chain.The parts store offers free check engine light tests.Their reader only said ""O2 sensor"". Parts guy said other things can trigger an O2 fault,so you should clean this, check that, etc. Wasted 2 weeks chasing nothing.This reader said which O2 sensor was bad and why. Replaced the sensor...problem gone.Oh, almost forgot. Beat local prices by more than 50 percent!"
3,Does what it's supposed to,"It does the trick - easy to use and not only gives the OBD2 code but also the name for the code so you have some idea of the problem before you research it.When I followed the web link through the software for more information, it asked for VIN and License numbers and had some 15+ diagnostic questions. I was expecting a more complete analysis after going through all that, but found it wanted $9.95 for a more comprehensive report that would include possible causes and troubleshooting info, which you can find on other web sites through search engines.I would have liked the product to include a concise Quick-start guide, and for the users manual to include a list of codes and brief descriptions. I didn't find the documentation to be user-friendly.If all you want is a tool to read the code, this is the tool for you. To make the results useful, you'll need to research the code on the internet."
2,"Creates Dependency, Not Good, Awkward in Use Compared to Others","Having used other units, I found the function keys on this awkward to use. Additionally, I found that I have to go on-line and pay for code meaning and pay for each time or subscribe to a service each year. That made the purchase and use totally bogus for me. It is okay for Ford products but not at all good for anything else unless I pay and pay and be dependent on Innova. I purchased this unit to be indepandent of service providers. I'm very disappointed and would not recommend this product to any mechanic, whether professional or amateur."
4,o.k. stuffproduct works on new and old obd2 systems with out a problem.,product works on new and old obd2 system with out a problem.better information than the previous version pf the 3100.
4,A very resourseful book,This book is a good book for those of you out there who want to learn more about the Kennedy and Lincoln Assassinations and what interesting things made them similar. ENJOY!
4,there is something seriously good about the kings of leon...cant put my finger on it but...,"realised i luv this band's sound and just ordered all of their albums on amazon...pistols of fire is too down and funky dirty.and they have a great blend of melody and rhtymn....i luv that ""let the good time roll,,, etc"" because the voice becomes the beat and the beat becomes the voice etc.....obviously they could make lots of money if they made a few more radio friendly californias waiting....im glad they havent..."
2,Fair to Good,Not a lot of action described. More personal information. Closer to fair than good. There was almost no technical information or much discussion of tactics or the aircraft involved. Not really very interesting.
1,Do Not Buy. Awful Product.,"This is just a terrible product. Total waste of money and energy put into treatment. The directions were followed precisely and did absolutely nothing in treating the ear mites of my two cats. Save the time,money,energy and trauma of treating your cat's ears and try another product. I just treated with the Otomite Plus product you can find here on Amazon and it seems to have done the trick."
5,Great book - very encouraging!,"I found this book very easy to read, and very encouraging. I have been inspired to look more for God's will in my every day living and to go out and spread God's love and joy to others, through the stories in this book. It is very easy to relate the author's anecdotes to my life, and I think the author speaks truth from the heart. This is a bold book and the theme flows well throughout the book. It makes me want to get out and be the hands and feet of God! You will be blessed!"
4,not bad,"Only wish the author would stop trying to be clever all the time.People who think they are witty, (very often) are not.However, book contains info Private Eye writers can use."
5,Very stable,"Been running this for two years, paired with an AthlonXP 2000+ and a Biostar M7VIT-Pro for the mobo. Can't comment on overclock potential, as my mobo/proc combo already eliminates the idea, but it's very stable and plenty quick for most uses. Obviously get two sticks if you plan on doing any video editing or more than moderate gaming, but 1 stick will be more than enough for office/internet usage."
2,"2 star because of our sony bran comp, could be higher if other brand...","I hate to give 2 star but the two star is only related to my sony computer because I found out that PNY works but NOT this corsair brand. We thought that It ship defected but tried it on another computer and it work fine, but not for this sony. so we end up returning it and bought a PNY brand."
2,Corsair Memory Worth the Investment?,"After installing the Corsair memory, I noticed only a slight increase in speed when opening web pages. Hence, I would have to question whether it is a worthy investment. My experience has been that increasing the memory on an old computer, rarely makes a signicant difference when opening large programs or graphic-laden websites. I have installed memory from other manufacturers, as well; all with the same disappointing results. I have concluded that buying a new computer is the logical alternative, especially since they are so cheap these days. Virtually all new desktops or laptops will function more efficiently than an old computer supplemented with additional MBs of RAM."
3,No real difference,"I doubled my PC's memory from 512 to 1 gig with this module, and the only difference I notice is a slight improvement in the speed at which programs open. I bought only because there was a $10 rebate, but I would not pay the price with no rebate. It simply did not make the performance difference I was expecting."
2,Disappointing Intro Title,"If you have an author you like and a style you appreciate it can be a good idea to order a book on that strength. I was wrong. Either that or co-author Peter Cope had very little input in this title. On the strength of his other 'Digital Darkroom' titles, this should have been a great allround title but it disappoints in being too superficial in almost every area. Neither does it feature Pete's very lucid style and approach, again suggesting he was perhaps a minor contributor to this title.I hate to be negative but I find the overall tone (presumably by the headlining author, Ian Probert) to be overtly journalistic rather than encouragingly educational.No, I would pass on this title and suggest instead 'Secrets of the Digital Darkroom' and excellent title by the same co-author."
2,Hard to read and pain in the wrist watch,I purchased this watch at the airport in Rome while waiting to fly home. It was a slightly impulsive move that I have since regretted. It's a lovely watch that is hard to read. The white hands blend into the background resulting in your need to twist the watch to figure out the time. The other annoying issue with the watch is the band. The release on the band has two little buttons that need to be pressed in to release the watch band. This works but the buttons dig into your wrist when you are working at a keyboard. I have had to take the watch off to continue to work.
4,Husband's Fave Pomade,"Can't find this product anywhere but through Amazon at proper pricing. My husband swears by it and while he has tried others, he likes this the best; use a little or you will have a real greasy look."
4,good hair product for the frizzies,good at giving some shine and straightness to frizzy/kinky hair; don't know why Sebastion stopped marketing this - their finest produdct in my opinion.
5,Amazing.,"This album is simply amazing. The organic beats from Amplive, enlightening lyrics from Zion, and kickass guest appearances make True and Livin' bump from ""True"" to ""Livin'"". Just makes me feel happy to be alive. All the tracks are awesome, and the album flows well, so I'd just recommend buying it and supporting this fresh group out of Oakland.Cop this, and anything else from Zion I. They're a hidden treasure. True and Livin' is a lot more musical than the others, but all their albums, especially Mind Over Matter, are easily worth the money and time."
5,SICK INSTALLMENT,"THIS ALBUM WAS STELLAR.... THE PRODUCION ON THIS CUT WAS OFF THE HOOK, EVERY TRACK WAS KNOCKIN MY SUBS IN MY CAR, EVERY BEAT WAS CLEAN, YOU COULD MAKE OUT EVERY LITTLE SAMPLE AND INSTRUMENT, EVERYTHING PLAYED SUPER LOUD, BUT NOT SO LOUD THAT THEY DROWN OUT THE VOCALS. IT WAS THE FINEST PRODUCTION I'VE HEARD IN SOME TIME. THE LYRICS WERE ON POINT TOO, THE DELIVERY WAS GREAT, DON'T WAIT ON THIS ONE."
5,.........They can't be stopped,"The album is bangin. Once again, there is nothing to skip. What really surprised me was track #12, ""Poems 4 post modern decay"" with Aesop Rock. I've always heard all the hype surrounding dis cat, but he usually appears to a lighter hue. (I.E. E&A, Atmosphere, Necro, need I go on.) But that track delivers, especially with the poem at the end. My history didn't start on no boat!! Talib Kweli came through to deliver, which was a good thing. He hasn't since train of thought. Amp's production is always on point, and they are never afraid to make music out of the box that is actually tight. (I.E. Amerikka, and Ow Lawd.) Rock, blues, hip-hop and trip-hop on one cd, that clocks in just under 60mins and done right;? They really are true to their craft and livin out the dream."
3,Pretty good I like a particular sound,"I like the sound of some songs such as:Doin My ThingBirds Eye ViewTemperatureOne ChanceStanger in my HomeThe nostalgic sounding organ is where its at. Otherwise the other tracks aren't my thing, but I like the conscious softer stuff so. It would be nice if they got a drummer a la Roots. Peace."
1,There has to be something better,"The concept of having a guide or tutorial on line for this subject is interesting but this product is very limited in it's scope, camera graphics are poorly illustrated and improving images with software (PhotoShop Elements etc) are so rudimentary that they border on useless. It would be far more beneficial to read thoroughly the handbook supplied with the camera and purchasing a dedicated textbook for the software such as the ""Dummies"" series than investing in a time limited tutorial"
2,"Good selection, poor performance.","I picked up this CD because it seemed to be a great selection of my favorite romantic classical tunes. I found the performances to be poor overall, however I was indeed pleased with the selection.This CD might be considered a bargain if you are looking for performances from most of the all-time favorites. But for quality performances, look elsewhere."
1,Did not fit,"Advertised as fitting a 2004 Chevy Venture, that was not the case. Worthless to me. As always it arrived in a timely manner and in good condition, and the price was great. Unfortunately it didn't fit!"
4,Good for costume or short term wear,"The product description on this is very bad and I took a gamble when I bought this. I am happy I did. I wanted it to accessorize a tinker bell Halloween costume. It comes with a halo, wings, shoes, wand and tutu. The wand and halo are fairly durable. The shoes and tutu are not but you would get your moneys worth out of them. The wings are floppy unless you tack them, but that was not a problem for me. I made a choker necklace and attached the wings to it. Not great as a free play dress up item, the wings a child would need help putting on. The shoes run small, I think. They did not fit my 4 year old daughter who wears an 11.5 wide. But she does have big feet! This is a complete costume except for a bodice and perhaps tights. A true value."
5,Short But Very Sweet,"I do not know enough about the current state of American letters to venture an educated opinion about where Mr. Owen Parry stands in comparison to his colleagues who are writing fiction today, but this slim volume of poetic prose is such good stuff that any author would be proud to have written it. I'm a writer too, so I'm cursed to know good writing when I see it, but I also know that no matter how hard I might try, I'll never be up to Mr. Parry's level. Well, that puts me into very good company with many so-called best-selling scribblers. These simple stories, told by a master, wonderfully evoke the joy of humanity at its best, and yet Mr. Parry writes with a steel pen: Reading these stories is like coming inside from the cold to a room with a blazing fire -- they warm you through and through and you're grateful for the respite they bring your soul, but your ears sting painfully from the howling wind outside. Ladies and gentlemen, not many can write like that."
5,Pure Joy,"This is a lovely, beautiful book. Author Owen Parry brings his trademark prose style to the short story form, making ""Our Simple Gifts"" a true gift to the reader. In four beautifully-crafted tales, set during the Civil War, Parry transports readers to that turbulent era and gives us a sense of how love and faith endure the strongest trials. Through Parry's graceful, lyrical prose the reader is moved by the lives of a maimed Union officer returning home, an immigrant soldier seeking to make sense of his new homeland, a newly-freed slave and a Confederate soldier just returning from a prison camp. With powerful atmosphere, vivid characters and a compelling message, this collection is bound to be a holiday classic. Parry is an American Dickens. A gift indeed."
4,SATISFYING,This little book will take you back before Christmas became an event that starts in October and is a money and advertizing glitz headache. It will transport you to a time when people thought Christmas greetings and a warming drink to celebrate the day with friends was enough. No matter what time of day you read it you will find yourself lost in another era and wish it was now. A short book - just an hour or so read that will instill your faith in humanity again. Please take the time to read.
4,Adult Christmas Tales,"Having just finished this book, I'm left with an impression tht Owen Parry has done it again. He is a master craftsman at writing. Having other books of his, under his real name, I'm struck by his Civil War era stories like this work. They reveal a lyrical and poetic side of him that I'm surprised and impressed with.These Christmas tales are not intended for children, just like the bookflap said. In the flashbacks, there are enough hints of violence to leave the reader the knowledge that Christmas isn't the day to read this aloud to children. When they getter older and wiser, they'll appreciate what these stories mean.The four stories contained in this book are full of what Christmas is all about: forgiveness, love, charity, and faith. Family is all important and no matter what emotional baggage and hurts, slights, and grievances there are, for one day at least, all of that is put aside.I look forward to his next collection of Civil Christmas stories."
1,HUGE waste of money!!,"I bought 2 packages of these before traveling from MI to NC for a family trip. I wanted to continue pumping for my twins and they seemed like a great idea since they stack nicely. On the way down I lost 3 pumpings worth of milk because the mini padded cooler they were in tilted to its side and all of the milk spilled (like loosing gold!)...Thinking MAYBE I didn't tighten the lids enough, I really cranked the next ones on...had to call 3 people before anybody could open them. That was no treat since I had 2 screaming babies waiting for bottles.These containers really are constructed poorly...they are sooo easy to cross thread and at least two of them leaked no matter what when I tipped them to the side...what kind of breast milk container leaks?? I strongly recommend purchasing something else!"
1,"pain to use, store, and expensive","I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead. They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately. Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get. Another waste of money from Avent."
2,Not worth the money,"I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump. I was wrong. Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once! Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing."
2,I prefer storage bags,I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.
4,Great and easy to use,"I have loved having these containers to freeze breastmillk in. They are easy to use. I pump a little bit at each feeding and fill up containers all day in the fridge and then at night-time, I transfer the containers from the fridge to the freezer. Also, I haven't found any leaking or problems putting the lids on properly. Just be patient and learn how to do it right the first time, and no more problems to speak of arise. My one complaint is that you can get extra containers (they are all pre-sterilized) but you can't buy just extra LIDS which I would really love. So thats my one complaint. Otherwise, I am loving these containers!"
2,not a fan,"I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time. After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles."
2,I like bags too!!!,They are messy when they opened. I get milk on my hands and they cost way too much. I don't have much room in my freezer. when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate... it's like $17 for ten :-(
2,horrible containers,"these are horrible, they don't pour well, and can only be used a couple times. If you want more durable better quality and probably cheaper storage I would go with milk mates. Plus milk mates bottles can attach to certain breast pumps, mine is lansinoh, and its a perfect fit!"
2,Something I will not buy again,"The fancy design of Avent VIA system did attract me into buying it. However, after the first use, I was so disappointed that I throw everything away. First of all, it leaks. Secondly, it erupt in my frezer when I tried to freeze my breastmilk for future use. Thrid, the cap craked after second use. It was not convienet, not secure and not up to Avent's standard."
1,"HORRIBLE ill-fitting top, leaks and wastes milk! DO NOT BUY","The tops do not fit the bottoms properly, so when you mix formula it leaks out everywhere and the milk gets caught between the top and bottom, making it suction closed and impossible to open. The force required to eventually open this results in more spillage/milk loss. Also, there is no grip or leverage feature, so cups and tops are slippery - again, hard to open. I SO regret buying these things and curse them everytime I have to use them (and then clean my kitchen floor, counter top, etc.)."
3,Not practical,"I was very excited when I received this product since it was suppose to reduce the amount of time transferring the pumped milk to the bags. BUT, the lid is very hard to close/open. Have to take time and make sure it's the right position when close. It's slippery when I try to open it, kind of frustrating."
3,Spills and Leaks!,"The containers/lids leak milk... spilled milk is like losing gold!!!!! Even the times I think the tops have been screwed on well, they leak. If you tighten too hard and they still leak, it is hard to unscrew without using force and spilling more. I also have the same complaint as some other reviewers that it is hard to see how much milk has been pumped once the milk is in the container; crossing off the dates on used containers; and hard to keep track of used containers when you have a bunch. I'm going out this week to get a new storage system!"
2,bad outweighs the good!,This is a love/hate relationshipLoveThat they work so well with bottle accessories and cups stuff later on.They tack nice and don't take up too much room.Fit right onto the Avent pump.Store nice and works well for freezing.Great stackability.Easy to write on in pencil and erase (to know which batch comes first).HateThey were hard to screw on (the flat tops to the bottoms and many times were on crooked).Leaked too much milk (and as any BFing mother knows... losing milk is well like losing money).
1,These are horrible,"The lids are so hard to screw on straight. You think they are on tight, then when you hold them up at eye level you will often find that they are on crooked. Also when you twist the lid open or closed, it is hard to get a good grip because the gripping area is very thin.They are expensive too, a total waste of money. Who wants a disposable system where you have to keep (and wash) the lids?"
5,So convenient,"We couldn't live without these. The bags were just too difficult. I don't understand how some people have trouble with the lids when they always work for me, but when I tried using bags I would drop them and make a mess. The pros are: stackable, pre-sterilized, easy to handle. The cons are the cost. I use a Medela pump and just pour into these and stack them in the freezer. I use a permanent marker to write the date. There are 3 lines for dates. You cross off and enter the next one. After the third use, you know to throw them out. In between uses I sterilize in the Avent Microwave Steamer. What could be easier?"
1,Leaks,I got this system thiking that it would be great to have something stackable and convienent to use. I was so upset when the containers began to leak. I was even careful not to wash in the dishwasher- thinking that might be the reason for the leaking. I had my milk leak at least 5 times before I gave up.
2,Difficult to unscrew,"This storage kit is great with the pump and bottles. I used the storage kit to carry my son's formula powder to add to his bottle. If the lid was screwed on to tightly or improperly, it was completely difficult to unscrew. Also, if any liquid or power was in the rim of the lid it was impossible to get a tight seal. This storage kit did not meet my expectations for the price."
1,PLEASE don't waste your money on these,"1. they leak2. too expensive3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers4. doesn't work well for feeding"
4,"An interesting, well researched book of carols.","I bought this book way back in the late seventies whilst on holiday in Portsmouth, England with the intention of getting carols from it for singing within the family circle at Christmas time. It is a very scholarly work whereby each carol is scored for at least four voices and sometimes there is also a descant/trumpet line. I never used it for my initial intended purpose but is the source from which I was inspired to do ""Away in a manger"" with two penny whistles with the Klingende Runde für jung und alt at a Christmas concert in Meyenburg, Germany."
3,Nice Sampler -Not The 'Best',"This CD is an okay sampler, and a great overview of the first ten years of Spyro Gyra. I would recommend this disc if you plan on getting only one Spyro Gyra CD. However, many of their best songs from this era are not on this 'Best Of' CD. Their early albums are highly-recommended, making this compilation redundant."
1,"The third Spyro Gyra ""BEST OF""... Maybe THE WORST OF ALL!!!!","As much as I remember, this is the third edition of a 'The Best of...' or either a '... Greatest Hits' album of this truly gifted Contempo Jazz band.However, being one of the cases when a band has so many albums issued, being virtually all of them good albums as to spend some bucks to get them all...Then, pretending to resume its career in one single album that has had no less than three different versions, with no more than 14 or 15 tunes on each...... This new issue is definitely, a 'No Go'. Period.Try getting instead as many single albums as you can. With Spyro Gyra's high musical quality, you won't be disappointed."
3,Works well but quality is very poor,"This brace is very effective at reducing pain from golfer's elbow; however after a couple of months of wear, the velcro tab ripped off. I sewed the velcro tab back onto the main strap, and this worked fine. But after several months more of wear, the foam pad ripped in two. It is very comfortable, but considering the price, it is really a very flimsy product."
5,Fantastic AirCast!,I am very pleased with the overall effectiveness of this pnuematic armband. My tennis elbow went away in 2 days while wearing this armband. Thanks for the great product!
2,Not worth the cost,"I received this in the mail today. Can't testify as to how long it will hold up but, the way I treat elbow bands, I doubt that it will last through spring. The most attractive aspect of this product is it's light weight. But it is made of very inexpensive materials and the ""air-bag"" is also cheaply made. I don't think it'll survive the amount of tightening I need for my tendonitis. Incidentally, my surgeon recommended this brand so it must have something going for it that I don't see."
2,Disappointed,I had one of these for years and it worked great. The newer ones have a smaller Velcro area and the strap pops off when I flex my arm.
2,Not enough pressure,"The armband is not made well enough to allow it to apply enough pressure to the affected area. The band can not be tightened enough before it cuts circulation, and the gell/air insert is a joke. It is not inflated enough to allow the band to assert maximum pressure to the elbow."
3,"Solved one problem, BUTT not another!","I bought this seat for the shape, I was unable to sit on a traditional bike seat for any length of time due to the pressure it put in all the wrong places.I have been able to adjust easily to the shape of this seat and can ride for extended periods of time, However the seat is very hard and sometimes when riding I find I have slipped down on the seat and am riding with pressure on my tail bone. It would be much better with a gel pad on top, or something that is much softer. I am planning on keeping the seat and adding extra cush to the top."
4,so far so good,"I'm glad I purchased the Ergo seat, it has solved my pressure problem and the new pressure points are very comfortable. I'm still getting use to the balancing but in a few weeks I'm sure I won't even notice. I would highly recommend this seat for anyone with a pressure problem."
2,"Ergo, The Seat-- Good idea, but did not work.","As far as my rear end, this was comfortable. But,this shifts your weight to the front, the handlebars. I had trouble with numb hands with my regular seat, even with foam handlebar grips, and good gloves, but this made that worse, enough so that this would be a deal killer. I simply could not ride very far on this. Trying this for the recommended 3 weeks would ruin my hands. Felt 'stretched out'. I really wanted this to work,too. You might be able to solve this by using a smaller bike frame, or a handlebar stem that would bring the handlebars 2 or 3 inches closer to the seat. Or, maybe, raising the handlebars. more to a 'comfort bike' configuration."
1,Not Comfortable!,"Ok, so i got this because i thought ""why not"". i am riding in a traditional bike seat (gel) and with it i still ket some pain after a long ride. i bought this thinking it was going to be softer and that it would distribute weight better. It did distribute weight better. however, after about 3 miles into my ride i began experiencing pain in my hamstrings from the edge of the seat digging into that area constantly while peddling. I tries to adjust the seat, but nothing. It was very uncomfortable to ride with this, and i ride fixie so im always peddling. the design of the seat digs into the back of your leg and creates sharp pain in the area. i ended up taking the seat off and returning it. not worth the money. i would go for a traditional well padded seat than this."
1,Noseless Saddle,"I cannot recommend this saddle. It forces you to put a lot of weight on your arms and hands. I felt like I was fighting the bicycle the whole time. I'm going to go with a more conventional seat with a cutout. If saddle pressure is really an issue, a recombent may be the answer. The Ergo Ultimate Bicycle Saddle is not."
4,Works great w/ modifications,"The seat works as advertised although it is a little hard and I found myself experiencing ""bike butt"" after riding only short distances. I purchased the Avenir Softee Saddle Pad to go over the seat and found that, after being cinched down, while it may look a little weird with the drooping nose, the combination works well. Bike butt is gone and the perineum pressure I experienced with the original bike seat has ceased to be a problem. The only thing about the seat I don't like is that mounting it requires at least 3 hands, preferably 4, although 2 will do in a pinch if you're patient."
5,Ergo bicycle seat,"I bought 2 of these and used them for about a year. needed to follow the suggestion closely about the (lower)height adjustment. Have gotten used to them and they seem quite comfortable. There is slightly more weight transfered to the hands on the handlebars, but hardly notice that after a while.And it may turn out to be good in taking weight off the lower back.Have tried them out on some longer rides, > 50 miles, without any problems.There's never any pressure feeling in the crotch area, that sometimes happens with narrow seats. So this is the only kind of seat I would want to buy now, especially if doctors say it might have an advantage."
1,Just awful,I tried this seat on two 17 mile rides and it was awful. I felt as though I was riding while my proctologist was doing an exam. After the second ride my leg near my hip began to hurt. I could not recommend this seat to anyone.
1,Not comfortable for me.,This seat did not give me the comfort I needed. I replaced it with a Schwinn No Pressure seat for $20. after trying several seats.
3,did solve my problem,"My problem was with my sit bones so this didn't really resolve it. However, if you experience discomfort because of the saddle horn, this could help. It feels a little funny a first, but it is a comfortable seat."
5,THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH,"THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH (NIOSH) has done extensive studies on saddles with noses and saddles with nose and a split. The results is that the saddles with a split are are more dangerous than the ones without. However, NIOSH recommends for your health that you ""... you ride a seat without a nose."" Ref. HETA 2000-0305-2848 City of Long Beach Police Department Long Beach, California by Dr. Steven Schrader, NIOSH. I am attaching his report. He has a new report that show the pressure on a seat with a split is higher than without due to the reduced surface area.Try ""The SEAT"" you'll like it.Ride in Healthy ComfortCERGO, LLC"
5,Aaaaaah,"As soon as I received the ergo gel seat in the mail, I removed the ball crunching seat that came with my Pugeot bike, and installed the ergo gel. I took it for a spin, and it made a significant difference in comfort, and enable me to spend more time on the bike with absolutely no numbness to my nether regions. Thank you for saving my family jewels. Biking is now a pleasure."
2,Not sturdy enough,"I have been riding this seat for almost a year. One of the metal bars that hold it to the bike broke today. If the seat was sturdier, I would give it a 4 star review. It took a month to get used to and could have used a little more padding, but I found it much more comfortable than my standard, very padded seat."
5,Just Fantastic!,"These Ergo seats should come on all adult bikes sold. I replaced the stock seat with another typical seat with a narrower horn. Ultimately, that did not solve my problem, which still limited my ability to ride. One should not have to endure pain and discomfort, while doing something good and healthy. ""No pain, no gain"" does not apply to biking, and especially in sensitive areas of the body. My first ride with this new Ergo The Seat proved to be a very comfortable and an enjoyable experience. The instructions suggest that it might take 3 weeks to get use to a new saddle. It took me 5 minutes! BTW, I did not follow the instructions, which suggested lowering the seat by one inch. I kept it at the same height as my former seat. Also, kept it level with the ground and centered on the rails. One of the rails is etched with a 0-centered ruler, so you could make precise adjustment forward and back from center.I highly recommend this product."
4,Great seat!,"Now that I've used a noseless bike seat, I'll NEVER go back to a regular seat. The first 2 rides it felt kinda odd, but by the third ride I was completely used to it, I don't even notice that it's different any more."
5,Definitely the best,"I've tried half a dozen different ""ergonomic"" bike seats that hurt worse than the regular seats. Ergo The Seat Ultimate is cheaper than all of them and is the one I've found that really works. No butt pain at all after hour-long rides. I'm no pro but I do ride hard and I put an average of 15 miles per ride. This seat is the best of all of the seats I've tried over the past 10 years. I highly recommend Ergo The Seat Ultimate."
3,Pretty Good Seat,It is better than the seat I had but my butt still is sore after 40 minutes on my stationary bike.
2,"Fixes the original pain, but brings its own for me","""The Seat"" does completely eliminate the normal discomfort of the ""horn"" digging into your rear.However, after two 90-minute rides, I think I need to get something else. After a while it causes a sharp pain on one side where my bottom makes contact with the seat, so that after about half an hour I can't think about much else. And it really pushes me forward so that I am leaning heavily on my handlebars (which are raised to the maximum height). Padded gloves help, but it's not enough.Then again, I do have a variety of nerve problems in my body (but none observed before in the place on my rear where I get the pain with The Seat), so for most people it could be fine.I'm going to try another traditional style seat, with more padding than the skinny/hard one one that came with my bike."
3,Mine broke :(,"I expect bike seats to last, this one didn't, so I bought the Schwinn version for less money, lets hope the big brand means something.The part that broke was the part of ""the seat"" that connects to the seat post. The cushion was still in great condition, which makes me feel like ""the seat"" was a waste of money since I've got a perfectly good ""seat"" with no way to connect it to the seat post."
2,"Too Expensive, Too Small, NO ATTACHMENT for bike seat","This seat does NOT come with the attachement to the bike...you must have a separately bought attachment...forget what it's called not, but the seat is DEFINITELY not worth the price, and is VERY small. (see pics from other buyers)"
4,Ergo Bike Seat,"This is the second one of these I've purchased. I now have both a hybrid bike and a road bike and have one on each. I would never go back to a regular seat. No more numbness or chafing. It's also very comfortable on the rear end of things. I do find it a bit slippery, though. For me, that's the only thing that keeps it from being the perfect seat."
4,Stunning voices...however,"The singing on this CD is unsurpassed, for what it is. Keep in mind that if you are not partial to boys' voices then this disc will not be to your taste. It is not necessarily a matter of authenticity. Yes, all male castes is the way Bach would have had it, but the idea seems too foreign for modern tastes.Personally, after the initial experience of hearing boys play the roles of soprano, it is hard to go back. Indeed, there is a purity to the singing of found here that I have yet to find elsewhere.There is one great reservation, this rendition of cantata no.80 is far inferior to the conductors other interperations. Had I not known the disparity of the two, I may had given it five stars."
4,Nice performances,"Leonhardt/Harnoncourt do a good job of recording period-like performances of Bach's cantatas. The boys voices are unique and fun to listen to. Probably not for the Bach novice. The use of period instruments and boy's voices will sound foreign at first. However, the music is beautiful never the less. All us Bach fans owe Harnoncourt and Leonhardt a great deal for their collection of recordings of Bach's wonderful cantatas. Thanks guys.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
2,Bad taste...,"These recordings don't bring out the potential in Bach's genius. In my humble opinion using boy sopranos, screeching trumpets, and conducting not for the music's sake but just to come close to sounding like the original performances are just bad taste. Other conductors have recorded much more moving and beautiful accounts of these works. The only good thing about this album is that there are not that many other concise Bach choruses collections out there. But even so, why did they leave out the most famous part of Wachet auf?"
5,See this band Live,"I saw Indigo Swing LIVE in Durham, North Carolina last night and they were THE BEST SWING BAND I have seen. They played songs off of all of their CD's. It was so awesome. They got the crowd dancing with medium tempo lindy-able songs, fast tempoed Jitterbug-able songs, and even some good slow songs. I had to leave early but they were coming out for their second encore as I was walking out the door. I don't think I have danced as well as I did last night to their music. If you ever get the chance to see them live DON'T PASS IT UP!!!!!!"
4,A fine debut,"I really liked this CD. I bought it after obtaining the other 2 IS releases, 'All Aboard' and 'Red Light'. I particularly enjoyed 'Swing Lover' & 'Choo Choo Ch' Boogie'. This album does have the feel of a debut and is a bit rough around the edges. The musician changes made for 'All Aboard' did improve the band a bit. An enjoyable effort, though, but don't go in after listening to 'All Aboard' or 'Red Light' and expect it to be quite as solid as those albums."
2,Bland Bland Bland,Unimaginative and uninspired. Your time and money would be better spent elsewhere.
4,Great for Swing Dancers!,"The songs on this album have a good shuffle beat for Lindy or Jive dancing. It's actually the right tempo for dancing, and more like authentic swing than the BBVD, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, or Brian Setzer. The style has a Cab Calloway and Louis Prima echo that makes it pure fun."
4,"Good songs, good recording quality, danceable rhythms",A must have for anyone looking for very Lindy-able songs with medium tempos. Overall a good mix of ballads and more up-beat songs-- these songs are very infectious and the disc stands up very well to repeated listenings.
5,One of the best swing bands around!,"Of all the new swing bands to sprout up lately, this is one of the very best. Especially good for swingdancing and lindy-hopping."
3,"Good CD, not quite what I expected....","After grooving to Royal Crown Revue, and BBVD, this CD is good, but it isn't the loud craziness that I love about modern swing of today! I was also I bit sad because it doesn't look like they write very much of their own music. All in all I'm glad I bought it because I love all swing music, but I'll keep on the look out for more wild music"
3,"Not Large, Just medium!",My kids don't like to set in them. I got two of them for my girls bedroom. Nether like them very much. They are very hard and not very comfortable to set in. I had beanbag chairs when I was a kid and lived in them. Perfect for TV watching. To bad these aren't the same!!!!!
3,Bought in April and flat less than 5 months later,"With regular, daily use, this bean bag was flat in less than 5 months. I got an awesome deal in Warehouse Deals for it (less than 20 bucks!), but I am surprised, considering its original cost, that it went flat so quickly. My kids were the ones using it, so it was being used by lightweights. :) I will say that the cover is very durable, hence the 3 stars."
2,"This is a very good bean bag, however it came with very little fill material!","I bought the XL size. Very good looking, good quality however it came with very low amount of filling material! I tried contacting the seller to ask them to send me more fill material but there is no way to contact them, they disabled this feature. The bean bag will need at least an additional half of the stuffed quantity to be usable. If you are the seller and you see this message then please send me at least an additional half refill material and I will delete this review.For customers: If you are seeing this review it means that the seller did not even try to contact me after addressing the issue. I would have given this a five star if the filler material was not so low!"
2,Not soft but great price,Great price for this bean bag. I would have preferred it to be softer but you get what you pay for.
3,Better for little kids,"Bought this for my 9 year old. Seems to be good quality and does the job, but it's a little too small for a 8-10 year old. Color is great, just as described. I would reccomend it for 3-6 year olds (my 3 year old fits perfectly in it)."
2,Not as what described for an adult so do not be fooled!,"I ordered 3 of these, 2 of which were for young children (large child) and one for a teenage boy (large adult). I loved the bags until I realized upon seeing them (they were a gift) that they charged me almost double for the adult and it is the exact same dimensions based on their own attached tags as the smaller ones. I have submitted a complaint and see what the company responds with.Best,*the company did respond promptly once I brought it to their attention, but unfortunately ""out of stock"" on the adult chair. They did refund the difference! I would recommend just ordering the large child even for a tall teenage boy as it is fits great!"
5,Great Find,"I looked high and low for a bean bag chair for my 13 year old daughter (who is adult size) this one was perfect size, good quality and she loved the color. Would buy this again for sure! I also bought the child large for my 6 year old son, again perfect size and he loves it."
1,very rigid,"Returned it almost immediatly...too rigid...doesn't ""form"" around your body. I am almost 200 lbs and had to wiggle a lot in order to sit comfortably. Bought it for my 5' tall daughter ..too small for her."
2,Disappointing Beanbag,"I bought this bean bag when it was on sale for my nephew.It is huge and will need some stuffing taken out to make it more child sized - to me its a regular size.My biggest beef is that the packaging for it was horrible - there was no box it just came in a large garbage bag and the bag had a hole in it!Also, the zipper pull on the bag was missing so I'm going to have to manufacture one so I can take some of the stuffing out.I guess I should have just paid more and gotten a better one. Lesson learned."
5,Marvellous,What a fantastic book....if you live in a small house as I do..1450 sq ft...you need to read this book. Paula so gracefully...& consistently encourages us throughout her book that small is beautiful...& you CAN have the gorgeous well decorated house you crave without letting size get in the way. Her creative ideas are astounding backed by multitudes of small house make-overs brimming with inspiration that's actually useful to those of us who are not rich..yet would like to have the nicest furnishings we can afford. She starts the book off with the premise that we need to STOP dreaming of a bigger house...& start getting bigger inspirations...which is exactly what this book accomplishes so successfully. I no longer long for a bigger house...& I'm in the process now.. of making my small house ...beautiful in every way. Hats off to you Paula for a job well done...wish more decorating books were as grass roots as yours...& delivered what they promise as yours does.
1,Don't waste your money!,"The majority of the photos are of cluttered, out of style room designs and decorating. Disappointing."
3,"Pretty, but not so useful","Maybe I was looking for the wrong things from this book. There are some great photos and interesting stories about some unique small homes, but I didn't find that many actionable tips."
2,Broke down after 15 months,"I used the camera for normal use for 15 months and the heads and mechamism failed. $300.00 for parts and labor to repair. It was a good camera until then, but I would think the parts would last longer that a year and half."
3,MAC User - Just purchased Frustrations,"I haven't used it enough to giva a good once over here however,...The USB cable that comes with the camera is only good for downloading stills and short video from the memory stick. The memory stick doesn't come with the camera.The USB streaming of video to a MAC needs to be done into the Firewire port. The firewire cable doesn't come with the camera.The instruction books tell you neither of these little details for MAC although there are instructions on using the camera with MAC OS. The on-line knowledge base just tells you USB Streaming is not available on MAC- not what the help desk said. We'll see after I get the parts.Other than those minor frustrations and the increased cost to get it to do what I originally purchased it for, the camcorder seems to be a nice upgrade to my previous Sony 8mm and Sony ""C"" cameras."
4,Love the Night Shot!,"The biggest reason we purchased this camcorder was for the night-shot. The resolution with the night shot is a bit grainy (which is expected with infrared) and has a mostly green overtone, but the night-shot plus has a color enhancer that works really well. Not vivid colors like you would get in the daylight but it's really neat for infrared. You can take pictures in pitch darkness. Just remember, with infrared pictures, your eyes will show up as a creepy zombie-like black!I can't say anything about Sony customer service because we haven't had to deal with them in the last year that we've owned this camcorder. Great product!"
2,great while it lasted (14 months),"Great images for 14 months. Then I got a dialog box that said the video heads were dirty and I need to run a cleaning tape - which I bought and ran per instructions. Didn't clear up. Went to Sony online help, was told to run it again. Didn't clear up. Tried a few more times, didn't clear up. Told it needs repair - $211. Guess maybe I should drop it in the water like the last guy whose TRV460 is indestructable. Sony should be ashamed for not backing these things up longer than a year."
1,2 years old and same problem,"I bought this camera in winter of 2004. It was a good camera for about a year and a half. This past summer I started getting the same ""Video Heads are Dirty"" message that everyone is getting. I've tried cleaning, but am still getting the message. Now it won't even recognize that there's a video cassette in it.Looks like I need to take it to be serviced, but I fear what the cost will be."
1,Camera Died after light use under 2 years,We had a sony handycam 8 and was very pleased with it's 10 year+ longevity. This Digital 8 camera has turned out to fail rather quickly with much less use in a much shorter period of time.After vacation it said the heads were dirty and to run a tape cleaner. So got the tape head cleaner and ran it several times but and no improvement. Apparently the heads have died on the unit. Piece of junk!
2,Outdated Camcorder for Window 7 & Vista Users,"Folks, This camera is old technology. If you just need the tape feature, Great!. The USB driver is not compatible with Windows Vista or 7 OS. Sony has no updated dirvers to install to correct this. You cannot download movies to you PC. The USB Streaming feature does not work with the new OS. You will either have to add a Firewire, which will add to your cost. Or just connect to a DVD recorder to transfer. Also, the Memory Stick is not made any more and outdated. If you use the stick adaptor, it works 50% of the time. Don't go over 1GB. Recording with the Memory Stick only produces a jerky playback. Not useful for quality recording. Only use for low quality picture taking. You will not be happy. Sony Tech Support not much help on the issue. They couldn't help. Hope this helps. More feedback on this issue on other websites. Not a lot of happy customers."
4,Mine's still working after 26 months,"I've read some poor reviews on what's happened over time with other people's Handycams, but I must say that mine still works after 2 years, a few typhoons and several 'dropping' accidents. I'm just now beginning to find some of the neat features of this camcorder, too!The reason I purchased this camcorder was because of the colored infrared nightshot, which works great! You can take pictures in pitch darkness. Although I must say recently I've noticed problems with the handycam's playback feature. It keeps switching to Hi8 mode when the video isn't taken with the Hi8 feature (this makes the LCD screen turn blue so you can't see the playback). I'll most likely buy another Sony with the color enhanced nightshot, but I think I'll switch to the DVD or harddrive version."
3,"Good camera, but don't buy it","I agree with most of the reviews written here, and it is a good camcorder, but don't buy it simply because Digital 8 is a format on the way out.The picture quality is okay, but honestly I really wish I had spent the extra money and bought one of the MiniDV camcorders instead.If you really, really want a Digital 8 camcorder, then this is a good one to buy. Otherwise, save up a little more and get one that is MiniDV."
1,cassette will not eject,Recording was jumpy. I inserted a cleaning tape. The cassette did not operate and now the door will not open and the tape will not eject.Does anyone know how to manually open the cassette door - short of breaking it.
1,Extremely prone to breakdown,"I've owned this vidio camera since July '04. When camera works it is a fine machine. BUT, just after warrantee expired tapes would not eject--repair bill $230. Now in 1/06 playback is horribly distorted--head cleaning tapes do not work so video head needs replacing--repair bill $211.00 I will start searching for a replacement unit (NOT SONY) that is not so prone to breakedown within 18 months of purchase. If you like paying for a camera over and over again, this is the unit for you--otherwise work hard to find a more dependable brand/model."
3,Battery,"I just unpacked my TRV-460 and charged the FM-30 battery, which comes with the camcorder. After setting the date and shooting for about 7 minutes, the battery was dead. When reading the manual, Sony doesn't even recomend the FM-30; but, they ship it anyway. When I replaced the battery with an off-brand FM-50, sold by a well known retail store, the camcorder powered up and gave a message that it wasn't a Sony battery and then powered down and didn't work. Appears Sony wants to only sell their batteries. Someone there must still be remembering Hiroshima or something. The camera is good. The accesories are high priced and what is shipped is inadequate to say the least."
3,Ignores a large section of Sikh women and girls,"Ok, the other reviews were overly kind. This book is great because it explores a section is the Sikh culture that is not widely explored or studied. The only reason i gave it three stars is because it explores an area not explored before. But as a Punjabi Sikh female born and raised in Calif., who is not orthodox and not deeply deeply deeply religious, i guess i'm more spirtual, I do not feel the book explored the social, cultural and relgious issues facing someone like me. I believe outside of Punjab, the homeland of the sikh, i think a significant number of Sikh females are like myself, and was disappionted that only a few paragraphs were devoted to touching on issues that i face and had hoped this book might explore."
3,Didn't like the book,"I read Cynthia's Fighting for Faith and Nation, very well written and objective. However I found this book to have a strong feminist stance, something that I couldn't connect with as a Sikh male. I don't believe that women are as oppressed as they seem to indicate in the book, I'm a young male so maybe I haven't had the experiences they've had, sorry Cynthia, I tried to connect with this book but just couldn't. Loved your Faith and Nation book, bought this one because I'm a fan of your work. I think the previous reviews are overly kind, but then again everyone is entitled to an opinion.cheers,"
3,"Engaging, But Not Her Best","Flagg has left the country and tried for, at least partially, a big-city story with this tale of a high-powered anchor women. She is only partially successful, and although she is a compulsively readable author ""Baby Girl"" is Flagg's weakest novel.The novel is at its strongest when Flagg does what she does best, traveling back to small town southern life. Her flashbacks to Neighbor Dorothy and her corny, homespun radio show are priceless. Modern day Elmwood Springs and its inhabitants are also enjoyable. Unfortunately. the novel sags with its main character, the unlovable Dena. I never warmed up to this cold fish, and the too-pat wrap-up was simply sappy.That said, I'd still grab Flagg's next effort and hope some of the magic of her earlier novels returns."
3,A pretty good read,"This is the first book I have read by Fannie Flagg, and although it was not one of the best books I had ever read, it was pretty enjoyable. I liked the character of Dena, but I have to say that I found most of the other characters very annoying--especially Sookie,Gerry, and in general the whole population of Elmwood Springs.Sometimes I found myself wanting to skip the chapters that brought you back in time and just talked about life in a small town. Still, I looked forward to reading it each day."
2,"While an okay book, it was a terrible let down","I put my kid to bed, kicked my husband out of the room and settled down to what I anticipated to be one of the most enjoyable reading nights I had the pleasure of having - WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! While I did laugh out loud once, the hairdresser coversation, the book left me longing."
3,Not as solid as her earlier books.,"As an avid reader of Ms. Flagg's other two books, I will admit to being somewhat disappointed with this latest book. It's not that it wasn't a pleasant read - it was just too a bit self-conscious and contrived. I did not buy into the scene with Tenessee Williams nor did I like the ending. Most of all, I found myself not really caring what happened to Dena by the end of the book."
5,I loved this book!,"What an amazing book! I have read all three of Fannie Flagg's novels and they are all wonderful, but Welcome to the World, Baby Girl! is so different from her other two. Less funny than Daisy Fay, but definitely more engaging. I read this almost-500-page book in 6 days, it was that engrossing. Loved the mystery about Dena's missing mother and the slimy tabloid reporter stuff. Kudos, Ms. Flagg, for yet another fantastic read!"
3,Great Book,"Welcome to the World Baby girl is told looking at the present life of Dena Nordstrom and the previous 40 years. Dena is searching for herself and her roots. Through this search she discovers many amazing things...The book is divided into small segments where the reader has the opportunity to capture the feelings and events of the time. In the segments the reader is also able to gather the small pieces of the big picture!Welcome to the World Baby girl is small town mixed with big city. We are introduced to characters in both worlds and can alomst create visualizations. In particular, the female characters of Dena, Aunt Elnor, Dr. Diggers, and Sookie are especially strong and memorable.This novel is not what I thought it would be. Flagg did an excellent job at maintaining suspense and creating a storyline that I never would have guessed!I truly enjoyed this book. This my first Fannie Flagg novel and I know I'll be back for more!"
4,A Summer Beach Read,"Fannie Flagg's WELCOME TO THE WORLD, BABY GIRL! is an interesting, easy read. It's a book you can take to the beach because it can be picked up and put down at any time without losing the flow of the story. Although the book's style is uneven meaning some characters are developed more completely than others, Flagg gets readers to reevaluate their views on important issues such as prejudice, the goals of newscasting, and the choice that humans can make to either tear down or support their fellow human beings."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Although the first couple of chapters were a little slow, once into this book, I could not put it down and read it in 2 days. Loved the characters and wish I could visit Elmwood Springs on my next vacation. Fannie Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes was a great read and this one is on the same level. Keep up the great writing and thank-you Ms. Flagg!"
3,"Entertaining start, disapointing ending.","I loved Fried Green Tomatoes and although this book wasn't quite as wonderful, I couldn't put it down. However the ending was a disapointment, it seemed as if the author need to tidy everything up quickly without much thought or depth. A very entertaining read for fans."
2,This book had the substance of cotton candy.,"Be warned that this book may be pretty and sweet, but contains little nourishment for the mind or soul. It reads like a shallow blockbuster and is entertaining, but left me feeling like I wasted my time on fluff."
3,"would've been, could've been, should've been.......","Fannie Flagg laid the groundwork for a wonderful story then (it seems) let someone else write the ending. I love her style of writing, weaving back and forth in time, but the ""big secret"" was nothing but a disappointment. There were also a few discrepancies (did anyone else notice that on page xxiii Norma's mother is named Ida but on page 233 she says her mother's name was Zela?), and whoever told Ms. Flagg that Missouri is in the South???? This story should have been set in Mississippi or Alabama, the true, deep South!"
3,"Flagg explores identity in good, but not great, work","I share the discontent of numerous reviewers who were disappointed with Fannie Flagg's most recent novel. Baby Girl lacks the depth and warmth of her two previous novels, but Flagg admirably succeeds in presenting a quirky, conflicted, isolated protagonist struggling to discover her identity. The hidden strength of this novel is the author's withering critique of modern visual journalism and the demise of the private domain in individuals' lives. With the current impeachment of the President over an essential private affair, Dena Nordstrom's conflicted commentaries are an unexpected pleasure. If you are a fan of Fannie Flagg, you will enjoy this novel, but you will be left with a sense that this author is capable of far greater achievements."
5,SOOOO much better than I'd heard!!,"I'm a huge fan of Flagg's other two novels, and everyone kept saying that this one wasn't nearly as good. I do think that's setting the bar kind of high...!! But this is a wonderful book on its own, and I loved it. The mystery is compelling, and the warmth of Baby Girl's hometown has stayed with me. I'm in love with Neighbor Dorothy!"
4,Good Readin',Loved the characters and Fannie Flagg does such a great job in letting us get to know these people throughout the book. I wanted to read more about them after the book was over!
3,"Good story, poor editing.","I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it weren't loaded with anachronisms -- which I found totally irritating. Like -- the characters alluding to Jimmy Carter's mother in 1975 (before he was even considered for the 76 election) or describing small town businesses giving way to Wal-Mart in 1976 (not an issue until the '80s) and so on (there were a lot.) These little slips in editing distracted from a fast and very readable story. Yes, in many ways it was predictable, but it also had an unexpected climax, which was an eye-opener."
2,Started with a bang and ended with a whimper,"Flagg's story-telling style, much like Garrison Keillor's rich tales of adventures in Lake Woebegone, capture the charm and humor of ordinary people and events. One of the warm memories of my baby boomer childhood was being allowed to sit up late, listening to the murmur of ""elder generation"" voices carrying on discussions much like those of Dena's charming Missouri relations. As in Fried Green Tomatoes, Flagg's moving back and forth in time was sometimes fun, sometimes poignant and overall a creative method for moving the story line along. The reading was enjoyable until Dena's ""BIG (unbelievable) REVELATION."" From that point on a story that opened with spirit fizzled into a disappointing melodrama with saccharine caricatures. Try again, Fannie, and stay with it to the end!"
3,I've read better.,"I was a little disappointed with Flagg's most recent installment of the South that we rarely get to see in the history books. I myself just couldn't get excited about ""Baby Girl"", alias Dena Nordstrom. I enjoyed witnessing her personal journey, but I found it difficult to feel sympathy towards her. ""Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!"" just wasn't as charming as Flagg's previous work. I must admit, it got better as it went along, but waiting until you're two-thirds of the way into the book is an awful long time."
5,You are guaranteed to smile from Page One until The End!,"Filled with humor, human drama, and downright southern comfort, the latest book from Fannie Flagg, Harper Lee's soul sister in prose, is a worthy follow-up to her supreme Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. From Post WWII Middle America to 1970s New York City, Flagg covers a lot of ground in the life of Dena Nordstrom, a Jane Pauley-ish, Barbara Walters-ish news reporter who is too ambitious and too career driven for her own good and comes to a crossroad in her personal and professional life. Buy this book and read it. Re-read it if necessary. The only drawback quite honestly is a less-than-thrilling dust jacket. The book deserves better. Be that as it may, the inside of the book is wonderful."
2,Surprised I didn't like it.,"I bought Fannie Flagg's other books. I'm glad I got this from the library. However, I am eagely waiting for her next book."
1,why did we wait,"It took a long while for Flagg to come up with this but what was the thinking or doing about during the time we waited? This is superficial, contrived, poorly pieced and as poorly stitched together as writing can be."
2,Disappointed,I loved Fannie Flagg's other two books and was really looking forward to this one. It was as if someone else wrote this completely. The book was one dimensional and really not very interesting. I didn't believe any of the characters. The story could have been interesting if the characters would have been more believable.
3,It's no Daisy Fay!,"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man is one of my favorite books of all time, and when I saw a new Flagg book, I snatched it up. I enjoyed the Neighbor Dorothy story line, and found myself wishing for more of that era and less of Dena's world. Dena was a spoiled brat, and I had trouble finding any sympathy for her. Gerry, although a little flat, was one of the funniest characters in the story. His antics trying to win Dena (I don't know why he wanted her!) were great, and it was nice to see a male character unafraid to be a little silly to win her over."
1,Yuk!,"This book justifies why I tend to avoid 'pop' best sellers. Not only were her characters 'plastic' and predictable, but so was the plot. This book was definitely a waste of time."
5,Loved it!!!,This was my first Fannie Flagg book and I really enjoyed it. The story continually switches from the past to the present and I initially found it confusing but came to appreciate the way it was written. I really felt for the main character of Dena. In the beginning I thought she was a bit shallow and selfish with her life spiraling out of control but by the end I found myself cheering her on and appreciating her for what she went through. The book slowly weaves characters in and out of the story and you wonder how the pieces fit together but by the end of the book everything comes together like a tightly wrapped package.
2,DISAPPOINTED,ordered large print for a gift and got very small print....kept it instead of giving as gift to my 85 yr. old mom who requires large print. wasted money
2,Does not rival Daisy Fay or Fried Green Tomatoes,"Having read her other two books, this one was a disappointment because I was expecting the same humor and wit. I struggled with the relevancy of all the flashbacks. Also, there is little mention of her love life in the first half of the book; even if she had no serious lover, she had the beauty and fit the age to at least warrant some installments discussing love, I think. Fannie, please bring back some of those great exclamations like ""Rats foot!"" And tell us once again of an other half falling into a vat of lacquer."
2,Not up to par with her other books,This is Fannie Flagg's weakest book. The story line is adequate but it lacks the humor of her former books. It's like Danielle Steele with a little depth.
3,"Very boring, I had to force myself to finish.",This is a very slow book to read. One had to wait until the very end to find out the big secret. What a disappointment. What is very interesting from the comments of others is their missing concept of identity. I am so happy I didnt grow up in a world that saw being black as a negative thing. I can relate to the pain of the brother and sister because it is hard to live a life where you cant succeed no matter how hard you try. The only way to succeed was to pass as white. This was a very sad book to me as a black women. To think that someone was so saddened by their race that they would commit suicide. I have also seen the movie Fried Green Tomatoes. Ms. Flagg always seems to dwell on negative aspects of black americans existence in the south. I would prefer reading something more positive afterall this is the 90s.
3,This is entertaining summer reading.,"You won't be intellectually challenged by WTTWBG, but you will be charmed by Ms. Flagg's characters. Those of us with Southern roots can probably ""remember"" the people she writes about. This is a great part of the book's charm. It's like sitting on the front porch, after dark, watching lighting bugs and listening to the grown-ups talk - very comforting and safe.Dena's secret seems tame by today's standards, and if Ms. Flagg is attempting to make the point that today's media has run amok she needs something more sensational to jolt our modern ""seen it all"" society. Still, there are lessons to be learned and one of the strongest is that hiding who we are can harm us and those we love. Perhaps this is the real message of WWTTWBG.By all means read this book. Elmwood Springs, Missouri feels like home."
4,A wonderful read!,"Where would we be without Fannie Flagg's great stories? The author of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" keeps pleasing---and surprising us with her ""down-home"" humor and great insight into all sorts of different human beings. I expected this book to be mostly humorous, but it has a story within a story. I got to a point where I couldn't put it down. I've read almost everything Ms. Flagg has written. Here's hoping for a new book of hers to come out very soon!"
2,"Passes the time, but not a satisfying read","I wasn't really expecting anything in particular, not having read Flagg's other books. Rosie O'Donnell said she laughed heartily at parts of the story, yet I can't recall anything that brought more than a half-smirk. At times I was reading just to pass the time and finish the story. The storyline was goofy and seemed disjointed, not to mention the sticky-sweet, disappointing ending."
3,Southern delight,"Well, Fried Green Tomatoes is Fannie Flagg's best, but Welcome to the World is also pretty good. It follows Dena Nordstrom, fondly called Baby Girl by her family, as she rises to some measure of fame as a TV anchorperson in Manhattan.But while others envy her, Dena is miserable, drinking too much, and battling an ulcer. She heads to a shrink - who promptly falls in love with her and transfers her to another shrink rather than deal with the conflict of interest between patient and doctor.Then comes job conflict, a muckraker who tries to dig up garbage on celebrities, upon which hinges sort of a trick ending.Pretty good, but not Flagg's best."
3,"Wonderful, but limited","The story revolves around Dena, an outwardly tough and ambitious girl - your typical modern day carrer woman by appearance, but inwardly vulnerable and lonely. She longed for something but the problem was, she did not know what she lacked and refused to let others get close to her to help her find out what it was. Written in a lively style, the book has full of adorable characters. The story was able to make me engrossed to follow Dena's ups and downs, rooting for her and symapathise with her. The only problem was, it failed to touch me and sadden me in areas which I felt is should - the part on Dena's mother and her brother. I failed to empathize with these 2 characters as I feel that I do not know them in-depth, the way I knew Dena. In fact, the only character that I knwe in-depth is Dena. I felt that the other characters were not given enough development for me to know and feel them."
2,This is NOT Fannie Flagg's Best Book,"I love Fannie Flagg, Lord knows I do, but this book was, well, it wasn't ""Fried Green Tomato's"" and that's what I was looking for. It is a tiring read that leaves you only remotely interested into what happens to the characters. I believe a lot of these characters could have been cut out. The reader might be frustrated because of the lack of explainations for events, especially when, at the end, everything is suppose to come together in a nut shell...but it doesn't. Seriously though, don't spend your time on this book unless you're a big Fannie Flagg fan, like me."
1,Poor story line and unbelievable characters.,"I would never have finished this book, were it not for the fact that my book club selected it. I think I can include it on my list of the worst 10 books I've ever read. Nothing seemed to work - not the story, not the characters, not even the prose."
1,I was disappointed with the content of this book.,I thought Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man was hilarious; this novel is not. I expected more from Ms. Flagg. This book read more like something that Danielle Steele would write.
1,extremely disappointing,"What a let-down after reading ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe."" Is this the same author? I forced myself to keep reading the predictable plot, ""TV-movie"" characters, and the oh-so-obvious pop-psychological analysis of the main character. Halfway through, I couldn't stand it anymore. I flipped to the last page, found out (like it wasn't obvious) that Dena gets together with the psychiatrist; the ""bad guy"" dies, and everyone is happy. No need to tortue myself further. ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" dealt with such strong female characters, social issues, and rich, funny characters. What happened?"
2,Cheesiness Personified!,"I loved ""Fried..."" and ""Daisy..."", and enjoyed parts of ""Welcome..."" However, my overall impression of the book was less than favorable. I thought it was too cheesy. The ""good"" characters were too good. The ""bad"" characters were too bad. Gerry, the nerdy doctor. Oh, God, totally one dimensional character. Wasn't likable in the very least. Loved Aunt Elner, though. I thought the mystery behind Dena's mother was so lame, I put the book down with 30 pages to go and didn't touch it for days because I was so disappointed with that revelation. There wasn't one word or action in this book that wasn't predictable. I could have written it myself word for word after reading only the first chapter. Except the end. I wouldn't subject ANYONE to that ending. I believe Flagg has an excellent grasp on small town America. She's a great storyteller when she's telling an original story. I've read this one a million times before by a million different authors."
2,"Farfetched plot, boring heroine","I found this book a real disappointment. Flagg's forte is obviously describing small town life and the eccentric rural types who live there. But put her in New York, introduce an ice-blonde heroine with ice water in her veins....and the whole story goes sour? Who could care about the scattered and self-centered Dena? The plot was full of unbelievable twists and just plain silly asides. The estate of Tennessee Williams should sue Flagg for the way she writes that poor man."
3,So-So,"This book was worth the read but it's not one that I think is going to stick with me for a long time. It's somewhat superficial but it is entertaining. I mean, how many beautiful, slim, intelligent,rich, successful, but oh-so-misunderstood heroines can I relate to one in one lifetime? That is, if I'm not a big fan of romance-type novels? I like the small town twist though. In the end, they live happily ever after in a white house, with a big front porch and they have lots of money. Just like real life, right?"
4,A wonderful book about life in the slow lane,"I read ""Standing in the Rainbow"" last week and wanted to know more about the people in Elmwood Springs, MO.After reading the excerpts and reviews on this book I checked it from the library yesterday. I haven't read it completely through, but did read the ending so that I knew the secret about Dena's mother. It wasn't what I thought it might be, but isentirely believable to me. I grew up in the Midwest in the 40's and 50's and that's the way it was. Younger folks may not understand that. It was a different time.I, too, have noticed some editing errors, but those are not the author's fault. Editor/publisher should have caught those.Fannie writes with a great sense of humor. Small town people are really like that."
3,A Story With Potential But Too Fragmented,"I began reading this story and was immediately drawn to it's 'darker side'. The main character, Dena Nordstrom, was portrayed as a hopeless, helpless, New Yorker whose life surrounded parties, alcohol, and celebrity. Quickly, however, the story changes ... to describe Dena's roots. I always love that type of story telling, but in this case, the original picture never resurfaces which felt like I never came full-circle with understanding Dena (or the book).This is the story of an abandoned woman's life; a woman who becomes successful regardless of the pain and lack of familia support. That part is inspiring, and sweet, especially since her extended family just about defines the meaning ""Mayberry"".While this book came out to be sweet-smelling and gave 'warm fuzzies' in the end, it still left so many open ended story lines. At least for me, and I like a good 'warm fuzzy' novel. This one just didn't finish all of the loose ends."
4,big star from small town,"Dena is a tv star and as such, only sees herself as a one dimensional celebrity, instead of a real person. So when her body starts falling apart from the stress of her lifestyle, and she must take leave from her job, it comes as a shock to her to allow herself to feel emotions. Her past bubbles up and demands closure before she can continue into the future.This book superbly displays some fantastic characterisations, and I felt it read more like snippets of personalities, especially the small town characters, rather than a continuous story. This gave me a great insight into the life of the town.Despite the length it didn't take very long to read at all; I was surprised when the ending came up so quickly!"
2,Uneventful!!!!,"This read is very, very, very laid back and uneventful. Very slow moving and just not captivating - several times I had to go back and read a paragraph 2 or 3 times just because my thoughts were distracted. Very basic reading and not captivating! Sorry Fannie! I loved fried green tomatoes... but this one, not so much!"
5,"Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!",This is a wonderful book. The characters are great and it will make you laugh and cry. It will put you in a good mood for the rest of the day!
1,One dimensional characters and simplistic plot,"This novel tries to take on a large issue but does it with one dimensional characters, who for the most part are sickeningly sweet. I found this novel insulting to my intelligence"
2,Made for T.V. movie???!!,I loved both Fried Green Tomatoes and Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man and was thrilled to see a new book by Fannie Flagg. The thrill was short-lived. All the depth and charm of the characters in her previous books is missing here. The dialogue seems stilted and awkward. This reads more like a screenplay than a novel. I was really disappointed
3,"Good read, but a disappointment in the end.","I agree with with other reviewers. This book was written for the big screen. I enjoyed the narrative writing, but the ending was a disappointment for me. But, it was a good read and I would read it again."
3,Pretty average,I have been waiting for a long time to read this book and I must have built it up too much in my mind. I read the book in 2 days and found it an easy read but not what I was craving. There were plenty of parts that reminded me of Fried Green Tomatoes but it just didn't quite make it. The best part to me was the Neighbor Dorthy's radio show!!!
4,"A great Fanny Flagg, wondeful reading",There is something quite unique about the way Fanny Flagg writes. She is truly wonderful. I wish she'd write more often. I can always empethize with her characters.I love reading about small American towns in the 30's and 40's.
4,Enjoyable,"When I first start this book, it was pretty slow going. Eeventually, though, I really got into it and enjoyed reading it. It was a typical Fannie Flagg book, in that the characters were very life like and you could really see them in your minds eye! I hope that she will come out with a sequel to this book so that we can see how Baby Girl is doing with her radio show and the people that she invites on to her show!!"
3,By the end it made sense...,"Another book club read for me.These are the things that I liked about the book:1) Fannie Flagg was the author.(POSSIBLE SPOILER)2) It approached the topic of 'passing' with regard to race...this I'm interested in from my studies in Sociology and Psychology.That's about it.If this hadn't been a book club book, I would have abandoned it half way through. I seriously had NO idea where the story was headed and since it didn't feel like a 'mystery' as such I had little interest in figuring the story out.By about 3/4's through the book I finally had an 'Ah-ha' moment and I was satisfied with the wrap up, but the way the story meandered it's way there didn't make the reward very satisfying.In discussing this for book club, I did enjoy the broader conversation of negotiating race and cultural hurdles especially as they still exist today. Being forced to 'choose' one's identity or having that choice made for you can't ever be easy.Overall, decent read, but not 'amazing'."
2,female characters,"I chose this book because I thoroughly enjoyed Fried Green Tomatos. My main complaint about this book was the presentation of female characters. Dena seemed rather shallow and one dimensional but was described numerous times as drop dead gorgeous as was her mother. The other female characters in the book, the gofer that worked for the sleaze king was described as unattractive with eating problems as was the black society writer who also happened to be overweight. Seems like Ms. Flagg believes in fairy tales. The good characters are beautiful and the bad characters totally unattractive. She even authored a statement following the death of the black female writer which was uttered by a policeman which was ""she is so ugly I am surprised someone didn't kill her earlier"". I really found this superficial and thought the author had a bias towards good looking and well to do women with good taste in clothes. For this reason I would not recommend the book."
5,Welcome to a Winner,"I waited for this book to come out for my Kindle and the wait was well worth it. I loved this book. I say that about all of Fannie Flagg's novels, but this really was special. I loved the story and all the twists and turns and time changes. I loved the southern humor which is so prevalent in all of her books. I loved the attack on our media and their desire for sensationalism instead of real news. The southern characters were the same wonderfully quirky group from Elmwood Springs. The NYC people were as ruthless as you expect them to be in the media business. Of course, there had to be one good guy who mentors Dena and makes her think about her chosen perfession. I loved the entertwinging story of her mother, brother, father and family. The prejudices were right on and handled with such expertise. I can't wait for Fanny's next book...wonder where she'll go with that one."
3,Shocking and depressing ending,"I loved Standing in the Rainbow and Redbird Christmas. I really liked this novel at first-just 'visiting' the people in her town. But the revelation about the main character's past, near the book's end, included some rather graphic and gruesome descriptions that really ruined the book for me. I didn't see the need for such violence and felt the story would have been better served by leaving out certain details."
2,choose another mop,"The pole of the mop is too short. I've had other mops of the same style, but the pole was longer so I didn't have to bend over while mopping. To purchase again? I would choose a mop with longer handle."
5,A Great Journey & A True Gift,"I really appreciated the journey that I took with Saul/Paul.Dougher's style of writing made me feel as if I was there with Saul/Paul during the pre-desert,desert,& post-desert.Once you start the journey,buckle up and be prepared for an ""cosmological"" adventure that will become both personal and spiritual awakening.Well done- by a good and faithful servant.."
5,"Well witten book I highly recommend it, for"" voice coaching""","DR. Morton Cooper, a pioneer in the study of speech and ""voice doctor to the stars,"" has a plan that will put magic in your voice. With his simple, minutes-a-day program,DR. Cooper shows you how to develop your natural, dynamic voice-a voice that will influence others and enhance your self-image. Many who rely on their livelihood have successfully used DR. Cooper's revolutionary series of exercises: Henry Fonda, Joan Rivers, Kirk Douglas, Anne Bancroft, Jerome Hines, O.J.Simpson, Diahann Carroll, Dennis Weaver, and many others.Until know, communication's most important tool- the voice-has been studied primarily by actors, singers, and public speakers. Change your voice, change your life offers every one the opportunity to have a star-quality voice. This reviewed is from the paperback edition."
3,VOICE BOOK,"The content was as advertized, and met my expectations. The quality of type face and paper was sub standard."
5,Change your Voice Change Your Life,If you jhave tried other approaches to voice therapy that have not worked for you try this one. If a client would like to try this appproach make sure that they realize that a good deal of effort and structured pracxtice is necessary to improve their voice. This new appproach will become second nature over time.
2,Overly wordy and a horrible typeface for this edition,"This book is short, but it's still a lot longer than it needs to be. 90% of the book a collection of anecdotes that get quickly tiring.Ironically, the publisher of this edition completely fails to follow the basic idea behind the book. The typeface is clunk and poorly spaced, and print quality is mediocre. I've never written a complaint about the production quality of a book before, but this one is seriously hard to read if print quality is important to you."
2,Two or Three Useful Tips,"I think this book is outdated. It's thin on practical advice about voice technique and long on stories about the author's past clients. The author had lots of amusing stories to tell (and has some life coaching advice) but if you want comprehensive advice on technique, buy ""Set Your VOice Free"" by Roger Love."
5,Gem of a Book - Missed by Most - Can Transform,"I bought this book for my 11 year old son who is doing some ""speeches"" in school.This book powerfully influenced my ""speaking"" many years ago.Highly recommended for anyone and everyone who wants to speak with their ""true voice"".- Namaste'"
1,Don't buy this book,I read this book more than 10 years ago. It was not helpful at all. It described in detail a variety of problems that pationts of the author had experienced. However it did not offer one practical piece of advice for anyone who believed that they had a problem with their voice.
2,Not Quite Enough,"Not quite enough. Not enough pages. Not enough exercises. Not enough real models of good voices (The book does not include a CD as is truly necessary for this sort of thing) Not enough visual illustration. Not enough good science (What does it really mean to say 'the voice should emerge from the upper two-thirds of the air passageway leading to your mouth?"")On the other hand, too much. Too much motivational schlock. Too much celebrity name dropping. Too much evidence of the hurriedness with which this book was put together.I hope the author will remake the book, include a CD, explain the science better, and get rid of the pages devoted to hyping voice training. The fact the reader has spent money makes that superfluous. Let's try again!"
3,Lacking Voice,"The book is full of success stories about the author's clients in all walks of life. It tells all the symptoms of what years of bad habit can do to your voice. It convinces you that most of us have problems with the way we use our voice.It does not tell you much about how to remedy it. Also, do not expect much if you are looking for something instructional.Main Keywords: ""Ummmhmmm"", mask"
2,CD Shuffle Feature a Must with this one,"You ever wonder where classical music station program directors get music to fill up those last 2 minutes before the news? Well this is one such recording - and 2 minute doses are its optimum listening time.Brueggen plays wonderfully. He has total command of his instrument: vibrato, dynamics, flying through the vivace passages with nary a misplaced note. The accompaniment is also excellent.But the programming is just too much. This recording is DULL. After 20 minutes you'll be ready to move on (and I'm a recorder player). The (trio) sonatas definitely hold one's interest longer than the (solo) fantasias, with the continuo to break up the monotony of the recorder passages. My favorite is the Sonata in F Minor. But on the whole, Telemann can't maintain the listener's interest for long.Hence the title of this review. The recording is fairly cheap and on a multi-CD player it would fit in well with other Baroque works in a shuffle sequence."
2,Is not made for insurance claim form at all.,"Envelopes are too big for insurance claim forms. Several of them have been returned to me by Post Office because the claim forms move around too much inside the envelope and therefore, you cannot see insurance address."
4,LOVE IS ALWAYS IN STYLE,"THIS ALBUM WAS AS CLASSIC, RICH & SOULFUL AS THE 70'S MUSIC GENERATED BY THIS SENSATIONAL ENTOURAGE. I WISH THAT THE CD (BETTER YET) ALL THEIR CD'S LISTED LYRICS AND A PERHAPS A MINI-HISTORY OF THE GROUPS START & MOVEMENTS. NOTEWORTHY, IS THAT ONLY 2 OR 3 SONGS AT BEST GET AIRTIME. IS RUSSELL THOMPKINS JR STILL A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP? IF NOT HOW DO I FIND OUT WHAT HE'S DOING SECULARLY?"
2,"This year, a loser","Horrible,horrible game it's even worse then Live 06. The only good NBA video game this year is NBA 06"
5,NBA 2k6 is THE best game on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"NBA 2k6 is the best basketball game that is currently out. It has a perfect simulation of what basketball games are actually like. I mean, if you're up against the Suns, they'll run the fast break a lot, and put up a lot of 3s. If you're playing the Heat, they'll be slashing to the basketball, and going for dunks and layups.Also, there are many exciting modes in this game. 24/7 is where you can create your own baller and make him rise to the top. Plus, there is an awesome franchise mode which allows you to take full control of a season.Another major thing that makes this game awesome, is the fact that you can actually get real player's shoes. I mean, sweet! You can create a character who plays with Nike Shox VC V on, or maybe some Lebron Zoom III.This is the best sports game on the market and one of the best games currently out for the Xbox."
4,NBA 2K6 Review,NBA 2K6 is one of the best basketball simulations I've ever played. The focus on running basketball plays really comes up front in this simulation. I really like the innovative shot stick control. It gives you total control of what you want your player doing at a particular point in the game. I really enjoy streetball mode really captures the aspect of real streetball. The road to the EBC is a great way to create your own player from the ashes and mold him into a superstar & dynasty mode is really deep. All in all NBA 2K6 is a must have for NBA simulation gamers and a great price.
4,Heavy and works like a champ,"I know a few have had problems sticking, but if you follow the rules (pre-heat and spray) you won't have any problems. Makes nice sized cornbread sticks and cleans with warm water. What more can you ask for?"
5,Perfect pan for cornbread!,"When I was a kid in the '60s, I used to visit my maternal grandparents in southeastern Kentucky with whom my mother's younger brothers still lived. Hot, freshly baked cornbread was a staple day in and day out and the most coveted pieces were the corners. With this Lodge pan, every cornstick essentially is a ""corner"" piece as each stick has a high ""crust ratio."" People complain that the sticks end up sticking to the pan but if you use it correctly, that's not a problem. Be sure to heat the pan in the oven, pull the pan out with mitts or potholders, use a small basting brush to oil each well with a bit of corn oil or bacon drippings, fill the wells with batter about three-quarters full to the top and bake according to your recipe, usually about 12 to 14 minutes. Use the tried-and-true test for doneness, using a clean wooden toothpick. The cornsticks should be easy to remove with tongs."
4,"Cute, but smaller than I thought","This ""large"" corn stick pan makes seven little 5 inch corn cakes. I wonder, if this is the large, how teeny-tiny must the mini pan be!Still, I love cast iron cookware and my red pepper corn bread looked great at dinner. Overall, lots of fun to have."
2,small cornbread stick pan,too small and would have to cook several sets in the oven to use up all of the batter and have enough to go around for everyone.
4,cornstick pan,I have been shopping around for this product as a fun gift for our son with no luck....10 minutes on Amazon and I had the product that I had been searching for...he'll love it !
5,"Large size, 7 ear corn bread cast iron- LOVE it!","Really wanted a pan that made more than 7 ears but currently the 9 ear pan is twenty dollars (ten more for two ears) so I will just buy multiple pans. They are small so it isn't a problem putting 4 of these in my oven. They came well seasoned, even more so than some of the pre-seasoned pots I've had. I pre-heated for 10-15 minutes, swabbed each ear imprint with a little butter and added the cornbread batter out of a sandwich bag with the corner cut off. I filled mine fairly full and it made them actually round when removed from the pan. Each ear on the large pan holds about 3T - 4T of batter. Cook 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven and let side for 10 minutes before popping them out."
3,Lodge Logic Cornstick Pan,This cornstick pan is too heavy for me and I haven't tried it yet so I don't know just how it cooks the corn sticks.
4,Decent,"Maybe it was the recipe I used, but I followed all instructions on the packaging and the bread still stuck a bit. I thought they look slightly more like sad twinkies than like mini corn cobs when all was said and done. Definitely don't fill to the top b/c then the bread gets a funny edge after it bakes."
1,Poor Quality,I received these two molds today. One of them was slightly damaged and looked as though it had been previously returned. Tape was wrapped around it affixing the tag. The black Teflon or other coating is peeling off. I can't be expected to cook with this if there will be pieces of chemicals flaking off into my bread. Not safe.
1,corn bread cast iron,"I love miniatures but this one is beyond miniature! My grand daughter cooking molds for the ""easy bake"" are larger!! Even if you put a lot of spray and flour it is absolutely impossible to unmold. I think it was a waste of money."
5,The book is authenic,"I have not yet read the book but am now ordering it. I noticed that a couple of the reviews from readers questioned the validity of the book. It is absolutely authenic. I was the Millers banker in 1981 when they lived in Rancho Santa Fe, Ca. and I visited their home on 2 occasins. Mr. Miller has a fascinating background which does include living with the indians and seeking out those who had fought Custer approximately 50 years prior to his painting their busts.His home was full of Indian artifacts which he refused to sell because they had been given to him and had special meaning. Mr. Miller was also employed on the sets of several cowboy movies as an Indian expert. He was about 75 years old in 1981 and I have lost total contact with him. I just want readers of this book to know that it is the real thing."
1,There is almost nothing new or accurate about this book.,"Beware! This is a very strange, and misleading book about the Little Big Horn Battle. The author utilizes already discredited accounts, changes others to suit his needs, takes no consideration of time and place for various events, and, it appears, constructs some events from whole cloth.If you really want to read about the Indian side of the story (and to understand that day, you must understand that side.)then read Lakota Noon."
2,Book makes MVP sound as though it's a death sentence.,"I decided to purchase this book for my Kobo because it was the only book available for that particular format on the market. The book was/is VERY well written, but it's a bit negative. I was diagnosed with MVP when I was 12 during a routine physical, dispite the diagnosis I have led a VERY full life. The author makes Mitral Valve Prolapse sound as though it's a death sentence, which it isn't by any means. The author spends a great deal of time talking about death rates and such, fact of life we all die. If you are looking for a way to learn to deal and live with MVP this book is not it. It is informative on some levels, but like I said, very negative. I do have palpitations and panic attacks but I've found ways to deal with them. My best advice: Diet, exercise, magnesium supplements, meditation, yoga, avoiding stimulants and a POSITIVE outlook. It's also good to find an outstanding cardiologist to work with you."
2,pages missing,I purchased this book starting at Genesis to Joshua. There are several pages missing and Amazon couldn't help me. I also have this downloaded onto a Kobo. There are no pages missing.
5,Helpful,I use this book as a reference guide in helping me understand difficult Scriptures in the Word. Dr. Wiersbe is to the point and says what he has to say with few words.
5,Excellent resource,"If you like alliteration and clear outlines along with easily understood application, this is the commentary for you. An excellent resource for finding clear explanations of scripture."
3,Devotional only,Wiersbe is a excellent commentator. The With the Word Commentary (Kindle) is a chapter by chapter devotional guide. It is not a verse by verse commentary and has only general details. If you want a good devotional guide Wiersbe's incites are excellent.
1,A terrible mis-representation of grass roots aviation,"I agree completely with malibugrif's review. I have been active in grass roots aviation for more than 40 years and my experience is that Mr. Gonzales is writing about the people who have no business in aviation. He completely ignores the thousands and thousands of us who safely year in and year out visit our grandchildren and in-laws and national parks and provide rides in the name of charity and generosity. As a long time pilot and flight instructor, I am deeply offended by this book."
4,Bach by Leonhardt and Harnoncourt,Good stuff. I have many of these peices separately in other CDs of Bach's cantatas under the direction of Leonhardt and Harnoncourt. The boy sopranos in this cd are wonderful. Great balance between instrumentalists and vocalists is a hallmark of the Harnoncourt/Leonhardt style. I highly recommend this CD.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com
1,Economic Nightmare,"This is the worst economics book i have ever come across in my 4 years as a student. The book is not only colorless and boring, but it does not seem to ge the main points across. Worse yet, the homework questions sometimes draw on information not explained in the text. Examples are very few, and the confusion is much. I would advise economic teachers to look elsewhere for a text."
3,ho hum,"I brought this book but it did not really tell me anything that I did not already know. They have a number that you can call to get a credit card. The card is supposed to help your credit rating and as I understood it, not one to use just to have on your credit report. I called the number they gave several times and there is a recording like a radio show, basically what is on the CD. You sit there for 30 minutes listen to this stuff all over again and then get disconnected. The promise of this card to increase your credit rating is a bunch of crock.I think this was a waste of money. I should have taken the money I paid for this and put it on one of my cards. LOL"
1,there was NO CD with the book,The book was SUPPOSE to come With a CD too! Where's IT AT? I feel cheated!!! I want the CD that I purchased!
3,Credit Secrets old and outdated,I purchased this book looking for up to date information dealing with the Credit Bureau's. The 800 number doesn't work. Overall it's just ok
2,"When it works,it is good",I like the coffee it makes when it works. The screen clogs often and floods the counter and floor. The auto stop when you want to get a cup of coffee when brewing does not work. A lot of money for a coffee pot that works part time and defective.
4,good item but not like the older model,"I purchased this to replace an older Braun coffe maker, that broke after 10 years of full service. Easy to operate machine especially the programmable features and the memory to remember the time even unplugged for up to 10 minutes. I wish the carafe could hold a 12 cup like the previous older model, and also that had the aroma adjuster to control it."
2,Automatic timer broke after 1 year; otherwise good coffeemaker,"I loved this coffeemaker until the automatic programmable timer that turns it on every morning stopped working. Now the timer just blinks like an unplugged alarm clock. Otherwise, the coffee is nice and hot. The burner is good too because it has a lip so the carafe won't slide off. Would give five stars if the auto-brew feature (which is why I bought the thing in the first place) weren't broken."
5,Great little machine.,"This machine is an improvement over the previous Braun coffeemaker we had. We bought this as a replacement because the previous one, after 5 years, was starting to wear out. One of the issues was that with the last puff of steam in the brew cycle, the basket would become unseated and swing out a bit, sometimes still retaining water to brew-through. This new model has a latch for the basket so this is one issue solved. Coffee is brewed quickly and is the right temperature. I thought the list price was a little more than I wanted to pay - but luckily, it went on sale at a department store for $49.99 with holiday sales. If you don't like the Britta filter in this machine, there is a spacer attachment, so you don't have to use a filter. For our normal drinking water,we use Britta filtered water from a carafe, so don't plan on purchasing filters for the coffeemaker for already filtered water."
2,Not as good as used to be,Save your money and buy a cheapee coffee maker instead. This makes coffee on par with the cheapest makers around. Braun used to make coffee makers that were the best on the market for brewing. You could set the brew strength and get a piping hot cup of excellent coffee. A big disappointment.
4,Braun KF590,"We've been using a Cuisinart Grind and Brew for the last 3-4 years and although it made a good cup of coffee, it was never hot enough. While searching for a new coffee maker, I found the Braun KF590. I was undecided between the Cuisinart DCC-1200 and the Braun KF590. What sold me on the Braun was the Brita filter. The hard water in my area made us have to use bottled water to make coffee. Now I can use tap water. The coffee comes out hot and tasty. The only drawback of this coffee maker is the flimsy carafe. The glass seems very thin and fragile so you have to be very careful."
2,Dead After 2 Years,"This was a good coffeemaker until it stopped working two years from the date purchase (surprise! Braun only provides one year warranties). I think for the price and for being a simple appliance, it should lasts longer than 2 years. I'm looking at comparable coffemakers with a three year warranty for my next purchase."
4,Braun's still the best,I tracked down this Braun coffee maker online when my 10-year old Braun finally broke down. I've tried other brands and still think Braun's the best.
2,Negative experience,"Came with a defective filter basket (not from Amazon), which took over 2 months to be replaced. Leaks coffee over the side sometimes. Not as well made as my previous Braun which I liked very much. Filter cost is somewhat expensive. Looks nice."
2,A far cry from the Braun it replaced,"Our 8+ year old Braun wore out on us, and we purchased the KF590 to replace it, despite seeing some fairly negative comments on Amazon. The differences in quality and usability are huge! The only positive things I can say about the KF590 is that it makes a tasty cup of hot coffee, very quickly. Everything else that previous posters have stated is true, to the point that we've already replaced the Braun with a Cuisinart. If I could return it, I would.Specific flaws; 1) Incredibly noisy, 2) Filter basket doesn't always stay shut (and when it doesn't, it makes a mess), 3) Water condenses everywhere and spills onto the counter, 4) overall, the design and build quality are second-rate. Not recommended!"
2,Good for a year: UPDATE,"I contacted Brawn. Even though the warranty had just expired, they did honor it and fixed my coffee maker at no charge. Kudos to Braun.This is the first time I've written a product review. I've found them helpful so I want others to know what I've experienced with our Braun KF590E coffee maker. A week ago I would've given the product 4 or 5 stars. The only problem we had with it at that time was that we had to pour the coffee slowly or coffee would drip on the counter.Yesterday, 12 days after the warranty expired, our coffee maker went totally dead after making a pot of coffee. The authorized service centers are nowhere near and Braun customer service is closed for the weekend. I hope to get this problem resolved through Braun next week but doubt that I will be able to do so. I would've expected a coffee maker at this price to last more than a year."
3,Drippy glass carafe,"I bought this because I wanted a built-in filter so I wouldn't have to use bottled water.The filter is the only reason it gets as much as 3 stars.The glass pot itself is a poor design. It drips and runs down the side of the carafe and makes a puddle on my counter every time. Other reviews said they could live with that, it drives me crazy! In addition, to program it, it is complicated and you could easily have coffee at the wrong times. It doesn't work like other programmable coffeemakers.The coffee is good, but like any other coffeemaker. It's expensive, so I say it's not worth it.If you're looking specifically for a coffeemaker with a filtration system, I suggest you get a different one even if you have to spend a little more money."
3,Disappointing over previous 12 cup models,"Purchased the Braun KF590E about 5 months ago and am disappointed with this coffee maker over Braun's previous 12 cup Flavor Select models (I.E. KF182).While I love the design, this coffee maker falls short in the following areas: 1)The 'no-drip' feature only works about 50% of the time when the carafe is removed during brewing. When not working, brewing coffee drips onto the unit. 2)Only 10 cups instead of 12 as was available in older models. 3)While coffee brews hot, over 1 hour time carafe temperature cools to warm on operating hot plate. 3)Cannot pour water or water too quickly from carafe; it drips."
4,Not bad...,"It took me a couple days to find a coffee maker that works good or better for less than $100. After reading all the review for this Braun model (KF590), I decided to go with this one. It's decent. For the $50 range, it's great. It makes the coffee a bit hotter than most machines. I haven't tried the paper filter yet, still using the ""gold"" filter but it works. The coffee tastes better in this machine than my last Mr.Coffee and I don't have to use 80 pounds of coffee grounds to get flavor. If it costs $100, shop around. $50, worth buying. $25, can't go wrong. By the way, the coffee doesn't stay as hot as it should after it's done brewing. Drink it or put it in a thermos."
3,"Great Coffee, Finicky Performance","Puzzling- how the carafe is difficult to pour without dripping.Perplexing- how a few (and I mean VERY few) coffee grounds between the filter and its housing causes coffee to drip down the sides of the carafe and over the burner and counter-top. It can be an irritating discovery in the morning.Surprising- how the Pause and Serve function doesn't always pause.Wonderful- when cared for fastidiously, the coffeemaker makes excellent coffee, quickly.I just wasn't bargaining for a 'high-maintenance' relationship."
4,Good But Not Great,"I so wanted to really like this coffee maker, but alas, that was not to be.Pros:The coffee is really HOTTimer and programmable automatic shut off are really niceLooks great on my counterCons:Coffee brews waaay too fast. If you are brewing just 1 or 2 cups, the coffee comes out weak. I use a paper filter and the included gold filter, which helps some. Bottomline, a slow brew feature would have been nice.Occasionally the basket doesn't swing open as it should. 9 times out of 10, it works fine. Every once in awhile you have to give it a nudge. Not a huge deal, but thought I'd mention it.I still give this 4 stars, because it does function well and nicely designed. If only it had a slow brew option, I'd give it 5 stars. I like my coffee really strong, so this might not be a problem for most people."
5,Braun's the best!,"This is my 2nd Braun. My first one was lovingly used until it just quit on me. In desperation, I needed a quick coffeemaker, and ran to the local discount store for a Black and Decker. After two years of the B&D, I got tired of mediocre, lukewarm coffee and decided to try a Braun again. I'll never again NOT have a Braun. The quality, the purified water, the gold filter, and the temperature of the coffee will always keep me as a fan and loyal user. I didn't know what I was missing until I went back to the Braun. The KF590 is just right."
5,Great Coffemaker!!!!,"I purchased the Braun, with some skepticism, because all my other coffeemaker experiences have not beeen good ones, but I have to say this one was a pleasant surprise!! The Braun has been easy to use and clean, while making a hot, delicious and speedy cup of coffee. The filter takes a second to place, and I really enjoy the feature of being able pick a shutoff time, from 20 minutes to two hours. All in all I would recommend this coffeemaker to everyone."
5,Excellent Coffee and Great Value,"Since water quality is a key component of good coffee, this maker excels. For the price, I could not find anything close that offered a timer for waking up to a fresh brew and also a built water filter and coffee filter. This model with the stainless and black accents is also very attractive in our kitchen and matches other stainless appliances well. I would highly recommend this coffee maker for anyone in the market. We might just by another one to have on hand for parties and large gatherings where we need to make more or make both regular and decaf. We've had braun coffee makers and grinders for years and this model continues the tradition."
4,Braun coffeemaker,This is my second Braun coffeemaker. The first one lasted upward of 10 years and I was very unhappy to see it finaly fail. The only recommendation I can make on the new one is that I would have liked to get a 12 cup coffeemaker but could only find a 10.
2,While it worked....,"...it was great. However, this was the 2nd time I purchased this model, thinking the 1st was a fluke. (The first one lasted 3 years) After 14 months, I woke up today to a machine that was on, but the warmer was not warm and the coffee never started brewing. As this machine only has a 1 year warranty, there isn't much I can do about it other than warn others. A little disappointing from a company that normaly makes quality products.It goes without saying that there will not be a 3rd."
2,Longevity is lacking,The buttons stopped working. I think it should last more then 3 years. At the price I paid for it. Otherwise it's cheaper to buy it everyday!!
4,Braun replacement coffee maker,"We purchased this coffee maker as a replacement to the Braun Flavor Select model which stopped working after 10 years of use.While we do like this pot, there are some options that this pot does not have which our old one did. There is no longer a 12 cup model. The new one is only 10 cups. One of the features we really liked on the old one was the 2 temperature warming plate which is no longer avalible. We also miss the flaver select feature that is not on this model. While we do enjoy the timer feature that you can set so your coffee is ready when you wake up in the morning, it takes much longer than the old model to brew a pot of coffee.All in all it is a good product, just not as good as you would expect a replacement model to be. When upgrading a model I feel you should add features not take them away."
4,Brain KF590E,"Makes a very hot coffee but the flavor is very good. It has a fast brew time. Only thing that was hard to figure out was the preset brewing timer...once you figure it out, it is simple to adjust. Key = holding the auto brew button down until the light blinks - release and then hold down either the hour or min. key and it will start moving."
1,Braun KF590E Coffeemaker,"The coffeemaker sends the water through so fast and hard that you end up with very weak coffee. When brewing a whole pot, it isn't as bad but, if you want 4 - 6 cups of coffee, it's too weak to drink. I tried adding more coffee but didn't make any difference - the coffee ends up all the way up the sides of the filter. I used it about 3 weeks and purchased a new Krups."
1,Leaks!,We have owned this coffee maker for less than a year and it has started leaking coffee all over the counter every 3rd time we brew coffee. We can't quite tell where it is leaking from and why it doesn't do it consistently. Each time we cross our fingers and hope for the best. This has been so frustrating! We have run the filter and the cone piece in the dishwasher and maybe this has caused the problem?? We brew coffee twice/day usually and have been more disappointed with this machine than any we have owned.
1,Bad Coffee,"This purchase was very disappointing. Although it's attractive, it is designed in a strange way in regard to the basket and how it attachs to the rest of the product. No instructions about this and putting it together was a real headscratcher for a klutz like me. Unfortunately, it turned out to make rather bad coffee as well. If I want a decent cup of coffee,I'm afraid I will be forced to buy a replacement for this product."
3,Good Coffee Pot...Bad Amazon,"The coffee pot itself is very nice. I have enjoyed many cups of coffee since my purchase about a month ago. The product itself gets 4 stars from me, however I purchased this coffee pot as part of Amazon.com's ""Lightning Deals"" at a price of $61.19 and feel I was ripped off. I have lowered my rating to 3 stars since Amazon.com now has this pot only a few weeks later for almost $20 less. Extremely frustrated with one of my top 2 favorite on-line shopping spots. I will definitely be more careful about trusting the ""Lightning Deals"" area of this webstore."
4,Hot plate temperature not adjustable.,This is an excellent product except for the fact that you cannot increase the temperature of the hot plate. It does keep the coffee warm but I would like it a little hotter
1,braun kf590e,Not at all satisfied. Did not make good flavor coffee and the grounds container kept coming open letting coffee spill out.
4,finally replaced it,"I have used this machine for a little over a year and half and it has performed quite well. I replaced it with a cuisinart machine and felt compelled to finally review it.PROS: This machine brews fast and flavorful coffee and is very aesthetically pleasing. I like the permanent gold tone filter and the water filter is a nice touch (although I quit using it.)CONS: Since I usually make small amounts of coffee (4 cups) I usually had to make more to compensate for the lack of heat since brewing 4 cups on this machine produced coffee that wasn't quite hot enough. Also over time the heating plate must've started to go bad because it hardly kept the coffee hot in the carafe. I stopped using the brita filters because they were expensive and hard to find and started using a brita pitcher instead.Overall I got good use from this coffeemaker and am pleased with its performance. I am moving on to a cuisinart because of the ""1-4"" cup feature that ensure hot water in small batches."
5,Best coffee maker ever!,"I bought this coffee maker to replace the same Braun I've had for 10 years. When it started going bad, I looked around locally and could not find Braun anywhere. Then I looked where I should have started, Amazon! Not only did I find the same coffee maker, it's an updated version with stainless steel (real stainless, by the way!) trim. On top of that, the price could not have been better. I think Braun makes the best coffee makers on the planet."
2,A TISKET FOR THE BASKET,"Makes good coffee, usual problems with glass carafe, but the big problem is the basket mechanism. It gets stuck and the ""brew"" stays in overtime. This happened virtually right out of the box.Braun advised us to order a replacement basket, pay the cost, fax them the bill for reimbursement. Seems like a NEEDLESS hassle for the consumer.When you order online, ya pays ur money and takes ur chances, eh?!"
3,"Daily coffee drinker, minneapolis, MN","This is a good, affordable coffee maker. Braun has always been a good product, but this one is slightly off from my expectations. The coffee maker is loud during brewing and it occasionally drips when pouring a cup. For the price, the product is adequate."
1,Had to return this!!!,Was excited to brew my first cup....Filter door would not stay shut...plastic got too hot on side and door kept swinging open during the brew...was a complete mess!
2,Broken Already..,"With the exception of the filter basket mechanism being flimsy and fragile (already had to buy a replacement w/in 3 months use); this coffee maker made good and FAST coffee. I was satisfied with my purchase...until now. With little more than a year of usage, it no longer brews coffee. Don't think I be buying another Braun product; I'm going back to Krups, which had lasted years and years."
4,Braun KF590E Impressions Digital 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker,"Overall I like this coffeemaker. My only complaint is that it is a 10 cup vs 12 cup maker. I've had 12 cup makers for so long, I didn't think it'd make a difference. For quantity it does (duh). Otherwise, it's a great maker. Fast. Keeps it HOT for up to 4 hrs. Highly recommended."
2,How disappointing!,"When our old Braun coffee maker quit I was determined to get only another Braun as I had been so happy with my other one! THis is not true of the new one. The new one has a smaller pot which is a big deal when you brew 6-8 pots per day. The new style pot LEAKS!!!! One of the best features of the old machine was unlike Mr. Coffee it didn't leak all over the counter each time you poured a cup. Stock up on paper towels! The new and improved brew basket pops out of place on it's own often. Nice mess that makes. I bought the original Braun based on Amazon users review. At that time one of the biggest ""features"" was it actually kept hot coffee hot. The new one does not seem to do as good a job. And oddly it seems that it takes longer now to brew 10 cups then it did with the old one that brewed 12. I sure wish I had the old one back!"
4,A BOYFRIEND'S TAKE!,"Yes, I bought this book for my girlfriend. And it had the desired effect. She giggled, then read it, and ended up telling me that it would certainly make it easier to appreciate me more when things weren't gold between us. The reason I've given the book 4 stars is two-fold; A- it's surprisingly short, and B- some of the boyfriends seem like people you'd never run into in the real world. But there's still a lot of good material here though, and it's got a great amount of laughs in its pages. You could easily find many, many worse $11 investments. This book does what it sets out to do, and I am highly appreciative of that fact."
1,boo.,definitely not what i wanted. :/ expected something completely different. did not like it at all. i'm not happy about my purchase.
4,Good low cost monitor,Just recieved this monitor and it is very clear and it auto adjusts everything so there is no real setup to do. Just plug in and power up. The only drawback is if you use a lower res than the one recomended it is not as clear. but the recomended res is perfect size and you wouldnt want to lower it. so i would say for the price this is a good choice
4,"Good, but careful with dual setup","I just got 2 of these from FedEx today for setup as a dual monitor. I got them because of the thin bezel, good for dual, and because of the price versus Samsung (I've got 2x 173T's in dual too). I must say that the monitors look great, both design and picture. No dead pixels, and slick design. The picture is warm, easily adjustable and razor sharp for text and colors. The included auto-adjust utility is really good. Problem is this, in a dual screen setup it is almost impossible to get the monitor colors to match. Maybe it is because one is running off the D-Sub and the other DVI with an adaptor. Don't know. The Samsungs don't have this problem (but they are on a dual DVI card). So, if you just want 1, GREAT MONITOR. If you want 2, expect to maybe spend some time getting them matched. Overall, very nice monitor at a great price. COMPETITION FOR SAMSUNG IS GOOD."
3,Only Good at Its Native Resolution,"The picture quality of this LCD monitor is good at its native resolution (1280 x 1024). However, when set at other resolutions, although the image quality is still good, the characters are somewhat distorted. Buy it if you plan to use only at 1280 x 1024 resolution."
4,Not bad,"A good overview of the main events of this period: if you're just generally curious about the Cold War and what the main events and trends in it were, this is quite suitable. However, the sheer brevity of the format of this series of books (and 'Seminar Studies' is very good, believe me) works against a fully fleshed-out account of this topic. There are mentions of certain events but they lack a little background needed to explain them. I kept finding myself reading some remark and thinking 'But *why* did that happen?'. Still, a good read, and well-explained."
2,Student Review,"As a student taking a first year University course in which this book is an assigned text, I have to say: there must be a textbook that is less boring than this one. In terms of facts, this book is great. Style-wise, it is enough to lull one to sleep. Best read in sections, carefully, closely, and with attention to detail so one doesn't have to read this book more than once, I would strongly suggest to any teacher or professor considering this as a text to supplement it with something that has a radically different style. Perhaps something with historical accounts intercut with the actual text rather than documents tacked on at the end. Just my opinion of course. :)"
1,foxyraidergirl,didn't like the smell and taste of these caps..made me puck..just the smell of it made me sick....didn't do anything for me...and the caps are too big and hard to swallow..will not buy it anymore..
5,Excellent!,I have not had a period in three years. I have been taking dong quai for three weeks. Guess what! I got my period! I am 44 years old. The product really works! I recommend it highly. I feel that my hormones are balancing!
3,Makes me happy,"I am 20 years old and I have not had a period for 9 months due to Depo provera, I have been in a very bad mood since my first and only injection back in September 2011, after taking Dong Quai for 3 days I have seen a huge boost in my mood, I am very happy now. I am just waiting for my period to return. If any ladies have tried this to induce period please email me I would appreciate it :)NizzyQrib@aol.com"
2,exterior photos only,"If you are looking for an academic treatise on nice houses of this time and place, or want to get a little history on specific houses in the area, I suspect this is a marvelous book. The basic pattern is one or two exterior pictures, often somewhat small, and a couple of pages of text, for each of a hundred lovely old getaway homes for the wealthy of the time. I buy a lot of books in the general vein of beautiful old homes/camps/cottages/cabins in beautiful recreational areas such as Maine and other Coastal New England and like most of them. This one just wasn't good fodder for the fantasy of what it would be to own one of these houses. There were only a handful of interior photos in the whole book, and many/most of the exterior photos are small black and whites from old magazines from the area. I appreciate being educated a little while I dream, but this one was order's of magnitudes too dry for me."
4,The Great North West Sound.,"Good selection of Portland groups. Portland was a hot bed of great music. They infulenced the grunge sound that got attributed to Seattle. Hey, Kurt Cobain hung out in Portland because the music scene was better. the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because their were other groups out there that should of been included. have fun,EVL."
3,Natural Health for Dogs & Cats,"Good book with some great ideas. I will say that even though some holistic and natural ways of taking care of your pet is a great idea it is not always the right way to go. My Boxer puppy Sturgeon came home with kennel cough, we first tried antibiotics and then gave the ways of this book a try. But the results were not what we had hoped for. We ended up going back to modern medicine after a 3 weeks of natural remedy only to see him gradually go back to his bad kennel cough days. Great ideas and philosophy but not a final cure."
2,Way to complicated to be practical,"The author is obviously very competent and sincere; however, as I must work to support my family and pets, the receipes for pet food take way too much preparation to be practical for most working folks. I have instead now turned to better products, such as Merricks, to feed my dog and so far, so good."
2,Kinda of disappointed,"Eggshell powder, Bone meal.. well, I can't seems to find this product in SG.. and to be honest. Eggshell sounds yucky to me. As for recipe for cats, I find it kind of odd, some of the ingredients does not seems safe for cats to consume."
5,A must have for dog and cat owners,"Often when the vet failed, this book saved. Fantastic book. I feed my dog a raw food diet and it has made a huge difference in his health. No processed commerical food for him ever again!"
4,Excellent Recipes,A great resource for animal lovers looking to prepare healthy and complete food for their pets! Lots of useful information about the nutritional content of the recipe's ingredients - really instills confidence that the diets will provide all the goodness our pet need.
5,Dr. Pitcairn's book,"I bought this book on the recommendation of many people on various cat-related lists. Because of the recent pet food problems, I decided that we really needed to be more ""pro-active"" in our pets' care. This is a good place to start. Easy to read, but not simplistic, starts with the basics. I recommend this book to responsible pet owners."
3,needs more recipes,I was really looking for more recipes than are offered in this book. Also not quite ready to do raw feeding and didn't realize that most of the recipes are raw. There is quite a bit of info on nutrition so if that is what you are looking for this is the book.
2,Not much of a recipe book,"I was looking for a recipe book for my dog that has a number of food allergies. When I searched Amazon for that, this book came up first. I bought it and it's a great book for holistic care of dogs and cats, but has only a few recipes. If you're looking for a general health care book for your animal, this is great. If you're looking for a recipe book, this ain't it."
5,The only book you'll ever need for pet healthcare,"I have both a dog and a cat, named Bubbly (for his personality) and Feathers (she has silver streaks that look like feathers). After a few very expensive vet visits which resulted in simple treatments, I thought I might be able to save some money in the future by taking care of small health problems for my pets. This book has become my bible for easy, natural ways to help keep dogs or cats healthy.I give this book five stars, for being informational, design, layout, and the fact that it's well written and practical. I'm not going to go into any details of some of the remedies this book offers, in respect for the author, but I will tell you that if you have a cat or a dog there's no excuse for not having this book on your bookshelf."
3,Not as extensive as I would like,"It has a lot of info about pregnancy and puppies, but I couldn't find a single thing on what to do for an infection. I know the basic herbs and things, but I was hoping for at least some info on it... And there isn't enough info on homeopathic remedies. This definitely is not the ulitmate nautral dog book. Thankfully it was a gift, so I didn't have to spend money on it. I guess its nice to have, but I haven't really used it in the past 4 years, and I have 4 dogs so..."
5,Complete guide to Natural health for dogs and cats,This book is invaluable to me. It's a must for any pet owner dog or cat. It is mostly based on homeopathy based treatments by Dr Pitcairn the worlds leading veterinarian. It has helped me with my own dogs numerous times in emergency situations as well as with chronic conditions.I have had clients phone me asking advice from me as I have learned so much from reading this book and using it as a quick reference. This can make the difference you need in a moment that your pet is injured and going to the vet. It also contains use full information on BARF diets for cats and dogs.
1,Not worthwhile for cat owners and if not a Vet,"This book seems to be based on opinion and does not seem to be research based, as there were no references. I found the book to be mostly focused on dogs. The information for some specific conditions for our feline friends had homeopathic remedies listed, that in my opinion, should only be administered by a Veterinarian with experience in homeopathy and one who fully understands all of your pets health issues. I tried to look up info on Hyperthyroidism in Cats and both the prescription pharmaceutical and the holistic herbal remedies that I had hoped to find where not even mentioned, nor was any homeopathic treatment for cats for that condition. The author also stated his bias that if a cat had hyperthyroidism it must be because he/she had been given vaccines, and as my cat has not been vaccinated and has this condition I wondered about the validity of his opinions. Dissapointing."
5,This is one of the best natural health books available,"I purchased this book at Amazon due to the pet food recalls. I choose this book due to the excellent reviews and was not disappointed...it actually exceeded my expectations. There are cat and dog food recipes, protein and calorie counts, cooking times for legumes and grains, protein, fat and carbohydrate contents for meats plus average calorie needs for cats and dogs. The sections on behavior and health offer a variety of Homeopathic and Nutrition options as well. If you want a few more recipes you might be interested in ""The Whole Pet Diet"" by Andi Brown, Dr. Pitcairn had written the ""Foreword"" for the book. My dog has been much happier on his new diet, I guess that says it all."
5,For my zoo,"We have 2 cats and a dog. This book is such an easy health reference and has great recipes. One of my cat just 'eats it up' and has gotten rid of his drippy nose! My other cat is amazingly healthy to start with and I know he loves this food as well, there is nothing left over like there is with the store bought products. It's a really nice way to bond with your animals and keep them healthy at the same time."
1,Potentially Dangerous Information in this Book,"Imagine my surprise when I read on page 225 of this ""expert's"" book recommending giving a dog raisins as a preventive for constipation. Raisins are toxic to dogs, especially smaller dogs with lower body weights. How reckless to recommend this knowing the potential of many owners to overdose pets. I wish I could return this book because I no longer trust anything in it."
4,A good basic....,This is a good book to have in one's library although it seemed like the areas of interest I had specifically when I purchased this book were not included. It still is a good reference book.
1,No grains for dogs,"I thought this would be a good book giving recipes on a raw diet. I was sorely mistake. The author suggests grains should be a staple of a dog's diet. Anyone who knows anything about dog nutrition should know that's false. I'm not sure why she makes the recommendations she does given her field. It seems like recipes meant for a human, not a dog. If you are looking for a raw diet, there are much better books available. Very Strange Woman!"
5,great over all book on natural health,"This book was everything I was looking for when it comes to overall natural health for my dog. I have been having issues with my toy poodle not eating. I had to start making him homemade food, (still keeping it raw) but didn't know what nutrients were important to include in his food to keep him healthy. This book helped explain what he needs and why ( in the process of seeing if my dog will eat recommended recipes).Also since the author is a Dr in the field I trust the information much more than jut any other dog information book from an ordinary author/ dog enthusiast. The local holistic dr here in the area is too far and cost $140 an hour. This is a good alternative book if your animal doesn't have anything too serious, but need to find a natural way to help before symptoms get worse. So, far everything I have read has been helpful and the cost of the book is dirt cheap compared to the valuable wealth of information inside. Get it!"
5,I would definitely order from MarJams again.,"This used book I ordered came to me in mint condition. Also, I always choose the cheapest shipping available and I received the book sooner than expected. I ordered it on December 10th thinking because of the Holidays coming up it might be a while before I received it. I got it in less than a week. I am very pleased with MarJams service. Thank you so much for the great customer service."
1,Yikes!,"What in the world is this vet's PhD in? Can't be nutrition or biochemistry or anything related or he would understand more about how excess grain affects the body- especially a carnivore's. Grain is links of sugar with some added roughage. Most of it is in the grass family. How often do you see a wolf or wild dog eat grass- other than to make themselves throw up? And the vet is a believer in homeopathy. Great, diet advice for my dog from a doctor that believes in the powers of ""magic water"". I'm sorry but I don't think the placebo effect will work on my pets!"
1,I really hope nobody follows the advice in this book,"1) Anyone with half a brain should be able to see that homeopathy is nonsense. The book loses all credibility right there.2) The diet recommendations for cats are absurd. There's no way a cat should be eating all that rice.I'm sure there's a lot more wrong with the advice this book doles out, but I won't be reading any further to find out."
3,ehh.. its alright,"i was surprised at what this book was really like because of the amazing reviews it has received. i assumed it would more of an indepth look into pet care/nutrition. needless to say.. i was pretty disappointed. if someone was interested in how to care for a pet for the first time then yeah, i would say this book is fine to read because this is more of a brief informational guide. but i would never recommend this to anyone that already has a clue on how to care for a pet."
4,using in conjuction,I use this book along with others to provide care for my dog.The alturnitve plans for food and supplements seems to inprove my dogs health.
5,Contains Good Advice,"Maybe it's just me but, do you know dogs like to eat bananas? And that they love carrots? And apples? And nuts?These are so healthy for them that I began, as the book advices, adding vegetables and fruits (make sure to check though, some plants--like a potato bush, potatoes are fine, it's the plant that's not--may be poisonous to animals)In just couple of weeks our ten year old labs look so much healthier, their furs are shinier!"
5,Great for allergies,"Our 13 year old dog had more allergies than any dog the vet had ever seen. After being on a diet from this book for just a few weeks she has stopped scratching, biting her paws and her arthritis is even better. She used to go to the vet every six weeks for shots, now she hasn't been in a year and is doing great. A little technical, but great information on high-quality food for your pet. We make it in bulk every weekend or two and freeze it for the week."
4,Great Bag,"This bag is good and sturdy. Holds many items in different pockets available. I would like for it to have be slightly longer, to hold more equipment. Other than that it is a good buy."
4,Very well done,Once again the French Show their excellent taste in Music...Acutually the Movie without it would have been perhaps a bit dull!
2,Short on Selling- Long on Long-Term Care,"As a basic primer on long-term care insurance this book is fine, although I much prefer The Complete Idiot's Guide to Long-Term Care Planning by Marilee Driscoll.As a book on how to sell LTC I did not find any value in the book at all."
2,Slipping and sliding,"The earlier reviewer who points out Gruberova's ""slipping and sliding"" is right on the money. Unfortunately, it IS extremely distracting and makes a mockery of what is supposed to be a bel canto role. Gruberova is more than capable of singing without doing it. Why she chose to do it for Lucia is beyond me, but it makes for a very tentative and unsatisfying performance, like a climax which never arrives. Most of the other reviewers rate this performance at the same level as Sutherland's, but that does great, great disservice to the Dame.It is unfortunate that I have to risk getting flamed for pointing out the truth, but I just could NOT stand idly by :( ...."
5,Love these socks,These are the only socks I have found that prevents blisters. I would have bought more but there were only 3 pairs left so I'll keep checking back for more.
1,Way too complicated...,"This book is full of facts, but facts that a beginning or novice artist really does not need. I was looking for a book that would help me with color choices. It was so technical that it really is hard to read more than a few pages at a time. And, the technical information was not really helpful. The author obviously has a lot of knowledge but the book is not presented in a way that anyone can learn color theory from it and use it in a practical way. I actually could not finish the book as I was not getting the information I needed from it."
2,so tricky.....,"We have had this puzzle for my son since he was less than a year and he has always liked puzzles. We have always found this hard for him. NOw he is almost 2 1/2 and can do 24 piece floor puzzles but still ""doesn't get' this. The overlapping nature of it is so hard because he is looking for a spot to fit the piece in his hand and there are none!! People have told me he is pretty smart for his age and he LOVES puzzles but he just can't figure this out...."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I have Doc's christmas album and just love it. This one didn't thrill me much. A lot depends on what kind of music you like and how you like it played. I don't like a lot of extra stuff thrown in. I like the melody to be pretty straightforward. It seemed to me that the band got so caught up in showing how innovative they could get that they sometimes left the song behind. I expected to hear a version of ""Georgia on my mind"" very much like it was played for the theme song of ""Designing Women"" but it really wasn't nearly as good. So, bottom line, listen to the samples of it before you buy, just to make sure it's your kind of music."
3,Unable to Read,I liked this authors other books but unfortunately I was unable to get past the second chapter of this book. I am not a fan of FIRST PERSON told books. If you are then I'm quite sure you will enjoy this book.
2,Rambling,"If you have read one of her books you've read them all. I think they all deserve it as they all have more or less the same story with few differences, but always way too many characters and sub-stories."
1,A bad needle drop,"This collection is a joke! Someone made a needle drop (a CD from an LP) in the worst possible way, from very old scratchy LPs. No care was taken in remaster this stuff, straight from the Lp, you can ever hear aloud when the needle hits the vynil. Ouch! Avoid this at all costs."
1,DON'T USE IN YOUR GUN!!!!,"THESE JAM AND EXPLODE IN YOUR GUN. IF THEY EXPLODE IN YOUR GUN, IT WILL BREAK YOUR GUN. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THESE FOR AIRSOFT!! GO TO www.airsoftatlanta.com and get yourself some BBs."
2,Poor Quality,"I've had my experience with these BB's (thankfully I wasn't the purchaser) and they are overwhelmingly junk. First of all .11 gram is outrageous. .20 is recommended for most guns, and usually nothing under that is even allowed in an arena (EX: Airsoft CQB Manassas). .12's are cheaper and usually made to save money and or for use in guns whose velocity would be very low with denser sizes. Whereas a .20 BB will safely pounce of it's target, .11's will probably shatter if shot anywhere over 250 FPS (300 is the velocity of a good gun) which can be very dangerous. It doesn't help that these BB's have seams on them, like plastic toy soldiers. Further reducing quality and accuracy.Long story short, DO NOT BUY."
3,No problems with them,Appear to be made without any defects. No problems at all with loading and shooting them. I would recommend them.
2,What do u expect?,"These are REALLY lightweight bbs. Also, they have seams on them lol how cheap can u get. These WILL JAM and are crap. But, for 50 cents 1000 crappy bbs is a good deal. Buy only if u are extremely low on $ and have a crappy, low powered gun to use with them."
3,only use on my pistol,these are ok i dont know why people are crying first off u dont use 0.11 bbs with a gun over 250 i personally find these bbs to work fine with a spring pistol but i wont use them on my assaultrifle. i would not buy these again though it took them 10 days to deliver really inconvenient just buy bbs from walmart
3,Outdated and not for new Macs,"This looks to be the only bird guide software available in the Macintosh format. Sadly, it's an old program, and requires you to run in Classic environment. On my G4 (OS 10.1.5), the program was slow and pixelly, and while it wasn't quite what I was hoping for, I was happily on my way to creating a Life List when -- all of a sudden -- my mouse disappeared. I haven't been able to see my mouse when using the program since then, so back it goes. Quite a disappointment.I didn't get very far before my mouse disappeared, but I didn't see obvious ways to create audio or visual tests for yourself, which is what I was really hoping for. On the positive side, the sound cues are really long and detailed."
2,Difficult to recommend because of serious flaws.,"While this CD-ROM is interesting and has a number of good points, there are several problems with it. Good points: very complete, with much information about each species of bird listed. Interesting video, text, sound, and pictures. Bad points: most important, this CD-ROM DOES NOT RUN under Windows 98 (although it works with Windows 95). It requires you to reset your display to 256 colors, with a corresponding lack of color depth in the included pictures - frustrating in this age of high powered graphics adapters. Sound files are overly loud and some were recorded at too high level, causing noticable distortion. This CD-ROM would benefit greatly from a makeover."
1,Software doesn't work with Graphic Accelerator Video Cards,"Even though the pictures and sounds are wonderful, if you have a graphic accelerator video card (most people do)you must go into your advanced settings in ""my computer"" and manually turn off the card. Then you must reboot the computer. After you are finished you must do the entire procedure over again. It's a shame because it ruins the software's usability. I wouldn't have bought it if they had advertised the problem. You don't know until you own it. Hope you learn from my mistake."
1,Copy protection,Although the program is good the copy protection that makes you have the CD in the drive to run the program is not 21st century. I have a mini laptop with an external CD that I usually don't have hooked up. To use the program I need to hook up the external drive. To me this CD is totally USLESS
3,Most birdbooks have clearer pictures.,"This is a very expensive product. I would expect clearer pictures, we get clearer pictures on junk Email. So far, I am unable to get the sound portion, which is why I wanted this program in the first place. Be sure you have a compatible sound card BEFORE you open the CD-ROM. I am told the Peterson version is better."
1,not appropriate for young children,"I do not feel this book is appropriate for young children. (4 years old). there are many weapons referenced throughout the story. On the first page, the young girl walks outside holding a sling shot. near the end of the story, the grandmother walks out holding an ax as she is going after the wolf, and then it reads, ""she snatched her shotgun..."""
2,Get the same information online,"""Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents"" is simply a reprint of the same thing from the US Department of Veteran Affairs. If you'd rather not get the information from the VA directly, whether in its own publications or its website, you might like this book. However, with a little bit of work you can get as much or more information online. The book is merely a summary and much less of a guide to claiming benefits.I found ""Veteran's Guide to Benefits"" much more useful."
3,Federal benefits for Veterans and Dependents,"Comprehensive, very useful for my people. Not for me or other 100% disabled vets, who are permanently and totally disabled. Many of our options are limited by the classifications."
5,Dog-Love,My 10 ten old Weimaraner has had his Talk to me Treat Ball for 7 years---to this day---he plays with it---he loves it. I bought extra disks to program messages---The one he seems to like is: Good Boy Rudy....it plays when he moves/rolls the ball
5,One of Doc's Highlights With The Tonight Show Band,"Here is another great album by a legend with other amazing artists along with him, such as Tony Bennett and Wynton Marsalis. Doc's playing is so phenomenal and the trumpet section with Snooky Young and Conte Candoli share solos and they are all amazing players. The saxaphones are very good as well. The whole CD is full of great songs played by a great ensemble with master players and it is a must have for a trumpeter or anyone who loves music."
4,A fine recording for country and western fans.,"Patti Page is in excellent voice. She has no vocal shortcomings to apologize for. The main thing buyers need to be aware of is that this recording is strictly in a ""country and western"" style ---- lot's of country fiddles and steel guitars. If you like this approach, you will enjoy this album. If your tastes run in other directions, you may want to think matters over."
4,A Basic Introduction to the Follies of Religion,"This book is scary! To read the assembled horrors that organized religion has visited on mankind is terrifying. This book covers all of the major religions, not just the familiar Christian tales of witchcraft and the Inquisition. However, note: it is just an introduction and is written on a pretty basic level. It would make a great junior high school text, except you can't imagine who would teach it."
1,Couldn't read this book,"This mystery has a fairly interesting review at the Public Library website, and takes place in a city I know well. But this book was a first person romp though marginal characters, a non-existent police force, and above all the large ego of its author. I didn't even care who killed the interesting woman poet introduced at the beginning to read the end."
3,These are ok,"These are ok, the smallest (1/16"") bent easily the first use and snapped the second. It is only 1/16"" so I won't hold it too too high of a standard. The other ones seem to be solid."
4,These Appear to be of High Quality,"I Don't usually write reviews on something i've yet to use, but thought that i should at least say that this punch set appears to be very well made and the quality shows in comparison to some of my other punch sets previously purchased from the big box stores."
1,Not real drive pin punchs,"A drive pin punch typically has a cone or ball tip to keep you centered on the drive pin. It also keeps from deforming the drive pin itself. I read all these reviews about how great they were and purchased them anyway. I drove out my AR drive pins with these but I had to very careful not to mar the gun finish. Walmart has a strong set of Stanleys for $9.88, but they are blunt tip also. Although I do not want to buy Chinese products, Harbor Freight has a set of cone tip drive pin punches for less than $12. I could not find any other American made products, ball or cone, on the cheap. You probably have to buy expensive gunsmith tools."
4,great purshase,fast shipping and great product. just wished the tips had a concave shape for better grip. fell strong and i like the design
3,Quality but way too small,"So disappointed in the size. Way too small for my teen son's TKD stuff. It's a beautiful bag, good and sturdy, nice feel but had to return and buy a larger bag from the instructor. If you want to put sparring gear in the bag, forget it."
1,Non-durable,Never got a chance to use the bag. The zipper broke with the first tug. Apparently its not constructed for its intended use.
2,"great music, lousy transfer to CD","I guess putting two albums on CD is a bit of s stretch for BGO records because the last three songe on Sweet Evil (the second album on this CD) wont play on my CD player nor on my computer, nor can I import them to itunes. These two albums arguably are the peak of Derringer's carreer in terms of his recorded legacy. I am very disappointed by the quality of the transfer and the errors on the last three songs, I may have a defective pressing since no one else here has mentioned but buyer beware."
5,Astoundingly good,"If you have ever been to New Orleans, you must have this collection - the best ""compilation"" of any genre I've ever heard. No city sweats music like New Orleans, and this set really captures the sounds, flavors, and even the humidity like nothing else. So whether you love New Orleans and its culture, or just think you might, or even if you are just curious, buy this and turn it up."
5,"If you like New Orleans music, it's all here!","From Cajun to Dixieland, R&B; to Zydeco, the Big Ol' Box of New Orleans has a little sumpin' for everyone. The four discs are a great mix of the funky to the rousing, brass bands and accordions, slinky blues tunes and rousing marches. The variety is amazing, but all of the selections have that unique New Orleans flavor.The 80-page guide is essential, giving great background for the newcomer to the knowledgable.I found some of my old favorites: Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, Irma Thomas, the Radiators, Marcia Ball, and many more. I discovered some brand new favorites: Zachary Richard first and foremost. I haven't stopped dancing yet."
5,Much improved quality,The plastic coated pages are awesome for the boating world. This is our second book. The non-coated book we previously had deteriorated in 5 years
4,Waiting for more from Cal Bennett!,Whole Soul Stroll is required listening for any soprano sax player! Cal achieves superb tone! Some of the other tracks don't show off his skill as much as WSS but worth a listen just the same.
4,Great product!,"I purchased this for my 12 month old daughter. She LOVES music so we tried to find a MP3 player that had speakers on it. She just loves it, and it is perfect for little hands. It also has a keypad lock on it which is very nice."
1,PLEASE DON'T WAST YOUR TIME/MONEY,all i can say is i wasted my money.... i might as well just ripped my money in 2 please please don't buy this you will 100% BE SORRY
4,Quality frames by Safilo for Burberry,"If you know about eyewear, Safilo is a high quality frame maker in Italy. The glasses arrived in a case swatherd the distinctive Burberry check, but more importantly, the lens and frames were solidly constructed and smooth."
3,No Pitney Bowes Usage,"We bought them in replacement of the Pitney Bowes tapes, and they didnt work (as a single unit). You will need the double sided ones or else they get stuck in the machine."
3,Not the original tapes for dm300,"We bought these in a pinch when we ran out of the dm300 tapes 625 0. These are the right width, but aren't perforated in the middle. This makes them way too long unless you have a greeting or message included on your print. They work OK, but seem to jam more often than the original tapes.There isn't a lot of selection with prime shipping but in a pinch these will get the job done (as none of the local office supply stores sell anything close)."
5,Nice looking,"Very pleased with the quality and accuracy. I purchased this for my husband for Christmas, he was very surprised & pleased. Very impressed with quality of the .scope"
5,This is a great gun!!!,"This is a very high quality gun for the price. The scope is the best ever (exact quote from my 10 year old). The only thing is that it is hard to cock but you do get the hang of it and I think it will get easier the more it's used. It is also a heavy gun so this but very nice quality and will last a long time. It shoots nice and the kick back is equivalent to 22 rifle, which I guess is nothing. Very nice stock as well, all in all a great gun!"
2,Doesn't Travel Well,"I received my box of Manhattan Chocoloates, Chocolate Raspberry Cream and anticipated a high quality chocolate with a soft center with dark chocolate coating. But as my title states, as most candy doesn't travel well without proper temerature control, what I received was stale, slightly melted, the centers were hard and the chocolate was turning white and was not especially appetizing. Just not a good product to have delivered in the back of your Postal carriers truck on a hot day."
2,Not high quality,"If you are used to high quality computer graphics, stay away from this one. Low quality, low resolution, repetitive. Music is as bad as the video. Wishing I had my money back."
2,Absurd? I'll Give You Absurd!,"Management is a series of two to three page essays organized into eight sections. Each section deals with a different issue faced by organizations including communication, change, politics, technology, and leadership. While Management can easily be read from cover to cover, each essay is self-contained. Farson has designed the book so that the manager in need can turn to an essay and hopefully glean new insight into his particular problem. But if you're looking for enlightenment, save your money. Management is wholly unsatisfying, filled with platitudes. Farson talks about problems in management that most readers will easily be able to understand. In fact, most of the time, you'll find yourself wondering why Farson is stating the obvious. The most absurd thing about this book is the time you'll spend reading it."
5,Awesome,"This came in used, but in great condition & came in quickly. The chapters are short & hilariously absurd. It's definitely worth the price I paid & didn't take long at all to come in the mail. Great service from the seller & I loved the book so much, I decided to keep it. I originally bought it for a college class & was going to sell it when finished, but it's so good. I love it!"
4,Great reading.,A must read for both traditional and non-traditional managers. I keep the book on my desk and refer to it often.
5,Tired of hearing the same old presentations of Xmas music?,"This is my all time favorite Christmas CD. Most selections are refreshingly unknown. (You won't hear any of these at the mall.) The arranging is superb, the voices are beautiful, and I set aside one night every year to kick back in front of the speakers and crank the volume. Very therapeutic."
5,An antidote to Pop Christmas Music,I happened to hear this in an mp3 newsgroup and immediately bought it for my folks and several other people. It is an incredible performance and unlike anything usually heard around Christmas . I listen to Classical music all day while working and yet I've never heard this before . Everyone who received it loved it.
5,One of the best Christmas Albums,This album is an excellent selection of early American music done is a variety of styles - the notes are very clear about the choices made in performance.Watchman of Zion is of the Mennonite shape-note tradition performed as an unacompanied solo. Kingbridge is done in the West Gallery tradition in its American flavor i.e. women's voices rather than high instruments. Baptismal Anthem is from the Original Sacred Harp with the addition of the alto line i.e. as it would be performed by shaped-note singing communities today. It does not contain the singing of the shapes that you would expect on a folk recording of the piece. The flute solo of Wayfaring Stranger is a gem from folk transmission.The remainder of the album is as diverse and enjoyable. This should fall well into the top ten Christmas albums.
5,Real Christmas Music,"The track, ""Jesus, the Light of the World"" gave me goose bumps. It is both catchy and glorifying in sound. My favorite track. The entire sound of this CD is awsome, renaissance in sound."
5,This CD contains some rare gems!,"There are many delightfully refreshing tracks on this CD. While I'm not a fan of soloists, there are many tracks with a chorus. Many of these selections have a real Civil War-era sound to them. I especially like track 18: While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks, done in the form of a round. I've become addicted to track 24. This is a CD for all seasons."
3,RoboCop: PD... Pretty decent,"The music on the CD was pretty sweet. The problem I had was that most of the music were repeated. Most of the music uses the same tunes. It's as if the composer took some of the previous tracks on the CD and composed another couple tracks with them. The music does have that dark type feeling just like the RoboCop: PD movies. There are some awesome scores on this CD like [07] Pursuit. This music is fast paced and has that really nice beat to it.Overall, I'd recommend you listen to it. It's not that bad of a soundtrack. Pretty nice cover too."
1,Awful 'music',"How totally inappropriate is this music? Nothing like Poledouris' score or even Rosenman's RoboCop 2 score. In fact it's probably the most unthematic music I've ever heard. I cannot possibly think what kind of movie or mini-series this CD might fit. It's all over the place. And not even in an exciting way.Spanish trumpets, the kind you hear at bullfights, are used too often and of course such an instrument being used to announce the arrival of RoboCop is baffling. The rest of the score sounds like rejected music from the British 1980's TV series 'World in Action'. I'm not kidding, it's appalling. Stay away. Well away. Nothing at all like Poledouris' score at all or even the TV series score which used his theme to at least mediocre effect."
3,A thrilling beginning,"Tayler Windquest is saved from a brutal attack by her neighbor and landlord Erica Kirsten-Laird, who also turns out to be her mother's former lover. Tayler becomes infatuated with Erica and finds herself drawn into a dangerous web because an evil witch named Raven Delaire has targeted Erica for death. When Tayler finds that her feelings for Erica are reciprocated, she must find the powers within herself to stop Raven and save the woman she loves. Acker's captivating tale is a full-throttle supernatural thriller (the first of a trilogy) that is as confounding for the reader as it is for Tayler. The elements of Raven's curse and her motivations are revealed as the story progresses, but they don't answer all the questions. And the book could do with a bit of editing (especially that Spanish!) to streamline the story and clarify details, but overall it is great entertainment."
2,The concept exceeds the execution,"in this supernatural confection. Prose too purple for the rather sketchily developed plotline (for all the bloodshed and fake-Hispanic hoodoos, Raven's motivation ends up coming across as anticlimactic, since her viewpoint is no more fleshed out than are the sudden shifts of location necessitated by her curse). And the (too many) phrases in Spanish are a scandal! Just checking a Spanish-English dictionary would at least take care of the goofy gender mixups. But the idea for this story, with the romance angle, has great potential."
3,TKD Side Kick Bag,"The bag looks great was delivered on time. Great Service!!However, the bag is smaller than I anticipated and I will need to get a larger one to handle all the equipment I have. I should have sized it correctly before I ordered, which is hard to do over the internet."
1,The handle is wrong,I ordered the wrong thing because I thought it said chrome door handle full thing not just the handle itself.. Gf bye $20 and doesn't even fit on my 2000chevy 1500.. Stuff happens so well I learned the hard way.
1,No product to review!!!,"If you want a product for Christmas from Zoverstock, better order a few MONTHS in advance. No one told me it would come on a slow boat from UK."
4,from the vaults,"""Fightin' Side of Me,"" was recorded live in Philadelphia in the late '60s or early '70s, when protesting the Vietnam war was all the rage. This is the better of the two live Haggard albums I own, and I love his impressions, along with the novelty song ""Harold's Super Service,"" available no place else. That one inspired a story by Jean Shepherd for ""Playboy,"" about a pump jockey. Any song that can get Jean Shepherd interested is worth hearing--and singing. The truly weird part of this CD is just this--the first part, ""Just Between the Two of Us,"" isn't Merle Haggard. That's a Buck Owens album. There's no mistake whatsoever. So, this is the oddest combo on one CD I ever heard. Luckily I enjoy Buck, so no problem, and I would have paid the full price just for the live Haggard album alone if I had to. a real treat."
4,The Washington Artillery,"""The Pride of the Confederate Artillery"" provides a well researched look into the experiences of a group of volunteers that went off to defend their state during the war of Northern aggression. It is not overly detailed as to the movements of the unit, but does provide a well thought out and insightful look at the sufferings of the soldiers as they do their duty. Mr. Hughes also points out how the class differences between the bourgeois cannoneers and the lower class drivers and teamsters dissolved during battle only to resurface after. This book is highly recommended."
4,A Wonderful solution at the right price!,"We just had a new large dog join our family who despite his gentle nature scared our cats to no end. We heeded a solution that would allow the cats to overcome their fearfulness while not inconveniencing the rest of the household. This gate was great to find, and while the latch requires a bit more effort than anticipated it is working well."
2,First Reacher Book I did not finish,"Slow paced and bogged down in details, this sixth Reacher novel lacks the action that made the first five novels so good.I sincerely hope one of my favorite action heros hasn't slowed down to this pace permanently.Now Lee Child will have to win me over again. Next time I will wait for the paperback."
1,WITHOUT FAIL,"I stopped reading this 6th book at chapter 4 because the storyline just didn't hold my interest I fell asleep on it twice. Books 4, 5, & 6 had no action, very slow & boring. I hope book 7 is better if not I will put that down too."
4,Without Fail was a gripping read.,"""Without Fail"" was a gripping read; and it would have stayed that way if the narrative was not so stretched out and wordy. Too much (unnecessary?) descriptive material. However, the plot was ingenious and clever in the manner in which it unfolded, one credible twist after another."
4,My favorite so far,"Since my friend recommended the Reacher books to me on New Year's Eve, I've gone through nearly the first 7. To my surprise, this is my favorite one so far. Could be because I loved In the Line of Fire, which is directly referenced here."
5,Reacher,Ordered Kindle versuion. Very quick download even for the slow internet in Afghanistan. No issues with the purchase. very good book.
1,disappointed,"I usually love Jack Reacher and Lee Child, and find I can't put the book down - this one I definitely could put down. It went on and on and on but didn't really go anywhere. All a bit predictable."
2,"Ambitious start, ends up boring",Clearly not the best from this author. The story starts well but does not fulfill its promises. I had a hard time reading it through the end.
2,Cardboard characters and preposterous plotline,"Come on. Jack Reacher, hired by a top secret service field officer to ""consult"" and beef up the security afforded our vice-president, is given no ear piece with which to communicate with the other secret service agents he is ostensibly monitoring and spends over 90% of the book carrying around a ceramic knife rather than a gun. This leads to some really preposterous moments like when Jack, sensing someone is in a church belfry noisily climbs ladders pirate-like with his knife in his teeth and thinking thoughts of how surprised the bad guy's going to be when invincible Jack bursts through the trap door. Most of this book is concerned with letting us know that Jack is really a tough guy and his ex-military female side-kick is . . . my gosh, even TOUGHER. Disappointing."
1,"By the time the action picked up, ...just kidding! It didn't.","This is a big nothing-burger of a book, full of characters you don't care about and plotlines that don't move.It's like watching video from closed-circuit cameras for hours. And hours. and hours. It just doesn't go anywhere.Before page 200, I had stopped caring about the politician, the protectors, the bad guys, and the inter-departmental government feuding. Just... make... it... end.Yawn."
4,Reacher series #6,"I really enjoyed this book, and enjoyed a little more fleshing out of Reacher's past...it dragged a little in places, heavy on description, but over all very enjoyable."
4,Reacher revisited,I've started at the beginning and am working my way through the whole series of Reacher novels. Interesting thing is that they are all rereadable and very enjoyable second time around.
4,Without Fail,"As Jack Reacher stories go this one is tame in comparison to many of his others. Hate to see him going ""soft"" and will take this story in stride. Not the rough and tumble stories I'm use to but still all in all a good read."
3,This is just a so so Jack Reacher............,I don't even know what to say about this book except that it was more government procedure than Jack Reacher adventure. It was too much!!!! Hope the next book is better.
2,Bring Back the Action....Please!,"This is by far the worst Reacher novel Lee Child has ever written. What happened to the Jack Reacher who kicks butt and takes no prisoners beginning from page 1? Memo to Lee Child: People buy/read your novels for the thrills, kills, violence and mayhem - not for history lessons on the Vice Presidency (or should I say the Vice""-""Presidency?) Sadly, there is absolutely no Reacheresque action in this novel until the last few pages, and by that time, the reader is so bored by Child's endless didacticism on American history, the much awaited climax is....well...anticlimactic. And are we really suppose to believe that the US Secret Service would allow an outside civilian to just walk into their agency and begin barking out orders and functioning as a trusted agent??? Ridiculous!"
1,Without Fail,"Not the best one I have read, but it was enjoyable. I probably could have given if three stars instead of just one."
3,Just Didn't Quite Grab Me,"I am a big fan of Lee Child. He's arguably the greatest mystery writer around today but this book just did not quite grab my attention like the others. One of the biggest knocks on Child is that he spends too much time on minute details. In this book, he spent an enormous amount of time on the smallest of details. The constant review of the videotape filming the Secret Service cleaners got to be nerve wracking. In fact, I was tempted to just skip ahead of all of that because it was a pain.In my view, this book is probably one of Child's weaker efforts."
4,Favorite new Author,"LOVE Jack Reacher. Loved all the books, except maybe the Persuader... But all the ones that precede that one are well worth your time."
4,Another good read!!,Reacher's ability to think like the bad guys is great. The tie in with his dead brother Joe and the additional details that are shared about their relationship and about Joe's personality really help give depth to Jack Reacher.
3,Customer review,"Being a die hard Reacher fan, i wasnt greatley impressed with this particular book. I love reading all about how reacher takes all the bad guys on at various stages throughout the book, using his previous military training etc. This one seemed to flow much more slowly with Reacher and his colleagues involved in the story moving from one location to another and trying to figure out/chase down the bad guys. Only at the very end does any major action happen. I won't say anymore as i may give away the plot, but if you really love the more intense, action packed and suspensful books in the series, so far i would definitely reccommend one of Lee's newer ones- ""Gone Tomorrow"" (awesome in a word) which is probably my favorite so far. Others in this category are Worth dying For, 61 Hours, The Hard Way, Trip wire, and Running blind."
2,No credible,"The notion that a civilian, no matter how qualified, would essentially take over the investigation into an assassination attempt on the Vice President of the United States is completely absurd. Here we have Reacher ordering Secret Service and FBI personnel around, and we're supposed to believe that they listen to, and obey, him. I don't think so."
3,This Dragged,"This was a decent thriller, but it really dragged through the middle of the book. I kept waiting for it to get going and then when it finally did, it ended with a thud."
2,Was this written to meet a deadline?,This was the 6th of the series that I have read and I was most disappointed with the lack of intrigue and suspense. Now I have read more books i feel compelled to come back here and add my review. The book has its good moments but the plot drags on and has a lot of blah-blah filling commentary.Not my favorite by far.Perhaps written by a ghost writer? Or a software program. Skip this one but don't miss any others.JohnG
4,Without Fail,Introduced to Lee Child and his alter ego Jack Reacher from a chance purchase at an airport bookstall I am now completely hooked. I am gradually working my way through the titles on my kindle and have loved all of them thus far. Jack Reacher really is a cult hero for the 21st century. Lets hope the forthcoming film is as good as the books ?
4,Mentally confining..,I'm a Reacher fan having bought ALL of Lee Child's Reacher novelsthis summer (2005). Reacher is too confined by the Pentagon'sgray walls and military mindset. I was claustrophobic untilthe story shifted to No. Dakota and Wyoming....then I began tobreathe again.
1,Wouldn't happen!,"Going to a civilian to ""red team"" an operation? A female MP NCO whose specialty is neck breaking? Loading a pistol's magazine one-handed? (That I'd like to see.) All Reacher is lacking is a cape and X-Ray vision. (Added after finishing the book.) ""On the click."" Reacher is dead. The condition of the magazine spring has nothing to do with firing the first round once it has been chambered."
1,1 Star for Chapter 1 only,"I am a disappointed Reacher fan. I enjoyed all of the previous Reacher novels and they were one of the four or five books I bought in hardcover because I couldn't wait to read them.Without Fail failed with me. Too slow moving. Dozens of pages watching videotapes (might as well be paint drying). Chapter One was good old Reacher material. Then it died.Too much espionage and psychological stuff, not enough action.Try a new author who knows how to give you what you want. Try Double Dealing."
5,Love JR!,I really love the Jack Reacher books and the story line so all the books are must reads for me! Enjoyed this one as well as any of the others!
5,Without Fail,Ditto quit holding these as hostages to get comments. Today is today aned tomorrow is tomorrow. Whos' counting these notes?
3,With out fail,It was good but not great. And one know like a little of this and a little of that.It had lot of mystery to it .
4,Page burner,Classic Reacher.....a 12 hour total escape from day to day cares. Can't remember any of it but I know it was good.
5,Without Fail,"I just love the Jack Reacher Books. Once I start reading i don't want to put the book down. They are action packed but also express Jack's thoughts, worries and feelings very well. Just love them."
3,Jack Reacher #6 its OK,"It took me a long time to get into this one. Kind of boring, but I had to finish. Not like the rest of the books."
4,"The ""Jack Reacher"" series by Lee Child","All I can say is that I love the ""Jack Reacher"" novels. The plots are very well worked out and the pace can get really, really tense. I've only worked out ""who dun it"" once in all his novels that I've read. I'm working my way down the list but never get tired of any of his books.I would highly recommend any of the books in the series."
3,I liked it - didn't love it,"Surprise on the ""who done it"" so its worth reading. When I put this up against other authors - so much better. When you pair it with other Reacher books - some others are better."
4,Lee Childs Without Fail,As usual great read and difficult to put down.Perhaps not as fast as some of his previous books though.Bought it on Kindle and would not hesitate to recommend.
4,Flat Out Intense!,"Someone is trying to kill the Vice President of the United States...and he hasn't even been sworn in yet.The head of his Secret Service detail has found Jack Reacher and made him a very strange proposition. ""I want to hire you to assassinate the Vice President of the United States,"" she says to get his attention. In essence she wants him to think like an assassin, look at the opportunities that will be presented and see if there are any holes in their protection. Reacher senses she wants more than an audit of their protection. There is someone out there.Indeed there is and finding out who and how Reacher and his sidekick, Frances Negley go about dealing with the mattter is some pretty fascinating reading that will have you turning pages late into the evening.Lee Child continues the saga of Jack Reacher with this novel. There is one thing about one of these...they are never boring."
4,Without Fail,"Another good Lee Childs book...the protagonist, Reacher, is not a deep guy...he's smart, ruthless, single minded and honest but not particularly introspective...that's fine because he's smart and he's tough and he prevails against the bad guys...if I want psychological depth I'll read something more challenging...this is escape stuff for men...kind of like watching a good, smash mouth football game..."
5,Without Fail - Well Maybe,"First I have to say that I am a huge fan of the Lee Child/Jack Reacher novels. I have read a lot of them. Without Fail was new to me. The story was been discussed endlessly, so all I need to say is that this book is pretty typical for Jack Reacher. However I found the story line about trying to assassinate the vice president a little creepy. I did really like Reacher's female Army buddy, and I thought she added a great deal to the story.As always, the book is well written and maintained my interest, even though I might have passed on the story. As always Reacher is able to provide the solution and resolve the issues.There is a new twist in this story for Reacher. He has inherited a house and has a girl friend. His dilemma is whether to keep both (girl and house) or to continue with his random roaming."
2,Reacher is not there yet!,"The Reacher character is still in progress. the plot is a weak rendition of a good premise. Reacher is a long way from the finished, all-powerful hero who doesn't need a clock to tell the time. In other words, the book is not really good escapist reading."
4,Without fail....another great read!,Enjoyed another Jack Reacher! Lee Child keeps the reader anxious to turn pages!Keep them coming...will be sad when all have been read!!
3,Hooked on Lee Child,"Have not read the book yet, but I am sure it will be good. I am disappointed in the condition of the book. This used book is not in ""Very Good"" condition. Hopefully I won""t get a disease touching it."
3,Not one the best,not one of the best of Reacher. Lacked content. He is better than this book and should get more respect
5,Another great read,"I really like Lee Child books--especially the Reacher series. He doesn't put up with any nonsense. I have read some of them more than once, and will probably keep reading them unless the price goes too high."
2,Getting old,"I was disappointed in Child's ""Without Fear"". I want to see Reacher's character develop, get ripe with age, grow. He needs a major upset or something, not more of the expected same old, same old character. Might be the last Child book I will read."
3,Usual Lee Child fare.,"Though I'm not finished with the book it is pretty good, though not the usual excitement yet. I'm only half way through it. I guess the Secret Service and the FBI aren't as active as Reacher is, lol."
3,Not up to par,"All in all a good read that I still didn't want to put down, but the ending was a bit less enthralling than previous editions."
2,POOR WORK,"The last third of this book makes no sense at all.other wordly perhaps or an author's attempt at padding out an already flimsy story line.It reaches a cescendo when with the assasins 150 yards away in full view he decides to get another 50 or so pages out of letting them get mobile and ends with two gambles, one a rifle barrel full of slush and two a Bretta breech jamming, because it was left for some time with full magazines. Some gamble. Some fairy tale.Poor, poor, it rates even more badly than Andy McNab,s latest Red Notice as a novel demanded under contract when an author has writer's block.Time to find a new and fresh writer as this pair have gone. It's a shame but stuff happens.Maybe it's because Child is overexcited about the dwarf version of One Shot being made into a movie and becoming a scriptwriter.Bye."
5,Outstanding Teacher book. Highly commended,"Typical Teacher book. Good read. Good ending, although I think the end was anticlimactic. Highly recommended. Don.t read just before bedtime."
3,I enjoyed it,"Without Fail was a bit slow but nonetheless a great novel. I enjoyed the plot and how well Reacher and Neagley worked together.For me, this is definitely one of the better Reacher series."
5,Another good Lee Child Read,"Lee Child is a consistently good story teller and has created a formidable character in Jack Reacher. I have read perhaps 5 Reacher books and all were entertaining, clever and fast paced. Reacher is a cunning hero...smart, savvy and very industrious.If you like mysteries and haven't discovered Lee Child's Jack Reacher books, you are in for a treat."
2,"After the first five, what a disappointment","I started reading Lee Child only a few weeks ago and just one book in I was hooked. As you do, I immediately ordered Without Fail after Echo Burning and I've really struggled with it. The characters are bland, there's no sense of impending anything and the yawnsome diatribe between the different agencies is something I find myself skimming. Maybe I'm missing the point, judging by previous reviews, but number six is deffo not my favourite."
3,Without Fail.....Falls Short,"I've read them in order thus far and have loved the series. Without Fail....#6....does not make the grade. In comparison to the first Reacher books, this one plods along. Action is limited, and isn't that a main reason for reading these types of books? By no means is the story awful nor is it a waste of money; it just does not rise above average. Plodding, characters lack a little depth, limited action - good overall, but just not the level of GREAT I've come to expect."
5,Without Fail?,"Jack Reacher, Lee Childs? This, like all Reacher novels, is a cliff hanger - excellent writing - don't miss it! I've read all the Reacher novels and they've all been 5 Star!"
4,Reacher delivers without fail,"In spite of the disappointing denouement, the book held my attention and painted an interesting picture of the inner workings of the FBI and Secret Service. Despite Jack Reacher's efforts to remain emotionally disengaged, his human complexity is evident. Not perfect, but most of life is not."
4,"No Strain on the Brain, Just Fast-Paced Adventure - A Real Blast","Lee Child's Jack Reacher stories came to me highly recommended from a respected source. I triedThe Enemy (Jack Reacher Novels)and decided that was not the place to start (it tells Reacher's back story). Without Fail, on the other hand, is simply a great bit of fun reading. Some violence, some sex, some conspiracy, some mystery. Excellent pacing.Reacher is brought in to test the Secret Service's security for VP-elect. He finds holes, but, hey protecting the VP is a tough job. And then, of course, he is told there is more going on behind the scenes and he really gets to work. You'll need to suspend disbelief now and again, but you'll get over it.Without Fail will entertain without putting a strain on your brain. Lee Child is not John Le Carre, but this is a great airport/beach read. A real blast."
5,Reacher's adventures,"Lee Child's adventures in the Jack Reacher's series keeps your interest on high......what,when,where! Love this whole series because they are filled with ACTiON!"
3,Another superb Lee Childs story,I am an avid Jack Reacher fan and the details and technical info included in this and all of Lee Childs work always impresses me.
4,Good book,I would expect nothing less from Mr. Child or Jack Reacher himself. I look forward to the next volume. Thanks
2,Frustrated,I am a big fan of Jack Reacher but in this instance I was frustrated by too many logic gaps and felt Reacher was lethargic in this book and the ending left me wanting.
3,"Not sure it's ""all that""","I ordered this based on the rave reviews. However when it arrived I admit I was a bit disappointed. Most of the alphabets are ""kiddish""- rocket ships, dinosaurs, fairy tales-which is great if that's what you are looking for. There are also some pretty florals and ivies. Not a lot of elegant letters (ie old English style-you know the kind that you find on fancy towels etc;) But if you do a lot of kid-sewing or lettering in general, this would be a good addition to your library."
4,Great for the beginning hiker/trekker,"I bought the poles for a trip this summer to a national park. With rheumatoid arthritis and balance problems, I thought they would help with balance, but also advertise help with stress on lower extremities. I have experimented with them and, as in the other review, find that the grips on the telescoping part can be too hard to turn at times. Also, after watching a Trek Walking video on the Internet, the straps are not ergonomically effective. Overall, though, I think they will suit the purpose of a casual hiker."
4,"""We Worship You""","This cd really ministers to my heart. After a long day at the office, I pop the cd in on my way home and take comfort in knowing that I can go and find strength to make it another day.I love all of the praise songs and I find myself dancing around on some of the uptempo cuts. ""We Worship You"" is truly one of my favorite gospel cd's."
3,Disappointed with the quality,"The colors are vivid and bright, the seller shipped quickly, but the puzzle started to wear and chip within the first day of my son getting it. Very disappointed in the quality of the product for the money."
5,Great learning puzzle,"We bought this puzzle for my 2 1/2 year old and she absolutely loves it. We bring it with us everywhere (restaurants, grandma's house, etc.) and it keeps her busy time and time again. It is a great developemental tool and extremly durable. We were very happy with the value we received for the price we paid. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,Two year old LOVES it!,"Someone bought my daughter this puzzle for Christmas (one month before her 2nd birthday). I thought my daughter would not like doing a jigsaw puzzle just yet, but we did it a few times together and after that she can do it all on her own. She loves it! She can sit and put the puzzle together over and over again 5-6 times 3 or 4 times a day. She claps when she gets the pieces together and I love watching the excitement on her face. I think the reason the pieces don't come apart so easily as noted in another review is because the pieces are at least 1/4"" thick. They aren't like your normal thin jigsaw puzzle pieces that people are used to. We also have had no problems with the image coming off either, but then again we have only had this puzzle for a month."
5,We love Melissa and Doug,"My three year old daughter loves this puzzle! She puts it together about five to ten times each day and never gets tired of putting it together! She needed a little help at first with the puzzle, now she puts it together all by herself and loves the fact that she can do it without my help. The educational value is great as kids try and find the way the pieces fit together to make a pretty farm scene at the end. I will be buying more of these for her soon, probably the next size up the 24 piece puzzle. These puzzles are very durable and I love the way the pieces never break and arn't flemsy like most of the cardboard puzzles. They really hold up to their value, I would recommend these puzzles for every child."
5,I love it,"My granddaughter loves it so much. This a good product, sturdy and easy to handle by 2.5 years old toddler."
2,poor quality,"The puzzles looked nice but with in a week the trays were warping and the ply was peeling apart, not becauses of mis treatment. I am disappointed with the quality"
3,Okay for toddler,"Decent puzzle, but has the same problem that many of today's puzzle manufacturers have when making puzzles for toddlers- the pieces aren't cut with the same color next to each other. So a toddler who is looking for clues to match a blue water piece with another adjoining piece blue water piece will have difficulty finding that. Instead you have pieces that have a hodge-podge of blue water, a snipit of elephant leg, brown dirt, and a toddler cant decipher that as well as a later year preschooler. Obviously, a computer cuts these puzzles now, not a human who is thinking about how a toddler will look for an image to put together."
3,Warped wood,"The puzzle is bright and cute, and the price is great. However the wood was warped so the puzzle never lays flat and the pieces don't fit together well. I am exchanging it.Update: I exchanged it and the new puzzle is fine. My almost 2 year old can already do it by herself and I feel it's a good quality puzzle and a great price. Recommended."
5,No complaints about this puzzle.,I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and it did not disappoint. He plays with it every day and loves it. It fits together smoothly and the wood will last longer than cardboard puzzles.
4,Great puzzles,"I was very please with the color and brightness of the pictures, they will be a gift and I am anxious to watch my granddaughter play with them, she loves puzzles and animals."
4,vision-processing therapy,"M &D puzzles are great stair steppers for advancing visual processing skills: part/whole, reasoning, and sequencing. Great tools for therapy!"
5,Great music,"I have always been an ABBA fan since living in Sweden in the late 70's and early 80's. I think this album showcases thier talent, and is not only an excellent choice for the Swedish listner but an international audience as well."
3,Pa Svenska,"For some reason Abba's songs sound even better in Swedish and four of their big hits are on this album, SOS, Fernando, Waterloo, and best of all Honey Honey. Unfortunately the remainder are weird folksy songs from the groups earlier pre-Abba careers, and not all that easy to listen to. This is worth having for the 4 songs mentioned, if you can get it at the right price."
3,"Phenomenal audio-biography of Lenny's life, view, and humor","This is a well put together package. I definitely don't recommend downloading this as it comes with an awesome oversized book containing photos of personal clippings, letters, and more information about Lenny Bruce. This is the most Lenny I've listened to at one time, and after listening to this and reading the book, I feel much more respect for Lenny and love him. There is some great comedy on here, but some of the selections were boring and had poor sound quality. I'd rather look into his live stuff and The Lenny Bruce Originals 1 + 2 for a more cohesive sound quality. If you want to learn about Lenny's personality and showmanship, you can't go wrong with this set -- this is an excellent production."
5,Essential material for any red-blooded patriotic citizen,Highly recommended listening for any red-blooded patriotic citizen and all compassionate members [or aspirants] of the human family.And for all crewmembers of spaceship earth [Bucky Fuller]
1,May have been funny years ago,A collection of blue routines and nervous laughter from the audience. If he were working today he would be a waiter.
5,More Than a Trek,"This story expands on the notion that an expedition does not necessarily revolve completely around kayaking on a dangerous river. Instead, it reveals that the arduous trek, diverse people, personal challenges, and team dynamics are what define an expedition. Overcoming that, the challenge of the Tsang Po presents itself as a reward.There's much to ponder about the challenges that contain the certain risk of death. Wick Walker's recount of this expedition helps us remember just what to consider."
2,"How can you make a book about kayaking a remote, dangerous river dull?","Answer: I'm not quite sure, but that's what they did. I suppose it's not too hard to imagine that the skills necessary to mount a whitewater kayaking expedition in Tibet are not the same ones necessary to tell the story interestingly. It's just a very dry and workmanlike account of the expedition without any of the vivid description necessary to bring the story to life for someone who is interested in the subject but isn't a kayaker and has never been to Tibet (like me, on both counts).I was expecting something more like ""Into Thin Air"" with kayaks, I suppose. A key difference here, of course, is that ""Into Thin Air"" was written by a writer.One benefit I did get from the book was some good references to some truly interesting history books on central Asia (like ""The Great Game""), which I have read and enjoyed tremendously."
1,Story Never Developed,"I was disappointed with this book. The story line never really developed. It jumped around and I never got a good feel for the expedition. I like to kayak and was hoping for a more descriptive book. Not that it matters, but the pictures were certainly lacking as well. Very few shots of the actual river itself."
5,Wonderful,This is my 1st child and I have been breastfeeding my LO for the past 4 weeks and needed to start pumping to prepare to go back to work but when I started to pump (with Ameda Purely Yours-also a great product) I was only getting about 1/2oz total from both breasts and I was so disappointed. I tried more frequent feedings followed by pumping and nothing worked. My doc recommended Fenugreek to boost supply. I purchased this product through Amazon two weeks ago. I got it 5 days ago and started to take recommended doseage (6 610mg caps per day and for the first 2 days saw no increase in supply but by day 3 I was able to get 1/2oz from EACH breast! Now day 5 and I am able to get 1oz somtimes 1 1/2oz from EACH breast! Going from 1/2oz to 3oz in 5 days I would definitely recommend this product! Oh fyi it does however make you smell like maple syrup lol weird side effect but worth it!
2,not for me,"i used the fenugreek, and it didnt really work for me. i would recommend it to anyone breast feeding that needs to increase their supply. it doenst hurt to try. some people say that they smell like maple syrup, and i did a little, but not too much, and i like the smell of maple syrup."
2,Not really sure of the results,"I have been taking Fenugreek now for almost 2 weeks to try and build up my milk supply. I can't really say that I've seen any results. I've been trying to consistently breastfeed every time my newborn baby is hungry (every 2-4 hours), but he still is only getting a very little amount (not enough to avoid making a formula bottle). I was pretty dry, and it is sloooowly coming back, but I think it may be more the fact that I'm letting my baby sleep beside me and nurse. Anyway, I may have to review again, but for now, this was not an immediate helper, like some reviews led me to believe. Otherwise, I prefer smelling like maple syrup to my own stinky sweat anytime! lol... BTW I suggest women with the same issues as me check out this: [...]l#increase - It helped me a bit."
5,"Quality, Value, AND Results!","I have been using Swanson's Fenugreek Seed capsules for the past 4 months with great results. I noticed a marked increase in milk production within the first 24 hours and have been amply able to supply enough milk to meet my growing 5-month old's needs. I take 2 capsules 4 times throughout the day, have experienced no side effects, and am now passing along the information on this ""wonder herb"" to mothers everywhere! What had before been a frustrating experience for both my daughter and myself has now become the relaxing and enjoyable time it should be. A heart-felt ""thank-you"" to the Swanson folks for providing a quality product at a fantastic price!"
3,Works just fine but....,"I bought this to increase milk supply (breasfeeding). It was cheap, and it came quickly- so no complaints there. It worked well too, BUT the baby gets diarrhea from it. I looked it up online, and yes, that can be a side effect. I can't remember what catagory spacificly that it was in, but I think it was peanuts, and also a high allergy food. So hopefully it will work better for other people... I just have to try other things I guess."
4,"Again, my ears are happy!!!","Bought this CD after not having listened to Dio for a while (The rest of my Dio-collection consists of vinyl records), and I must say, there was pleasant sounds in my living room! Of course, there was nostalgy involved, but the music in itself rocks too. One or two more songs from the Dream Evil-album, and I would have given 5 stars."
4,Great Blend Of Solo Hits,"Ronnie James Dio's career spans 3 groups and 3 decades. His solo projects as ""Dio"" which should be considered his 4th band were excellent quality rock. Reflected in these songs are his ties with rock greats Richie Blackmore, Tony Iomie, and others. But his early work with Elf is lost because his folk-blues style did not make RJD famous. It is ashame that works with ""Rainbow"" and ""Black Sabbath"" were not included on this package. But maybe we will see that in a Box Set later... pick this one up if your a Dio Fan it is a great add to any rock library. For more rare music visit Nakedsounds."
5,Envolventemente lo que se llama un BUEN LIBRO,"Un libro que mete de lleno al lector dentro de las entrevistas del Sr. Ramos, algo como para estar el lugar de los hechos y ver las actitudes de sus entrevistados al ser desenmascarados. Simple y sencillamente hay que leerlo."
5,Gladys Agramonte,I really love all of Jorge Ramos books. I have read a couple of his book and I bought this one to complete my collection. I like it very much.
1,"Será buen periodista, pero es mal escritor","Me decepcionó este libro, el cual no pude terminar de leer. A pesar de que me cae bien Jorge Ramos, y considero que se expresa muy bien al hablar, no supo transferir ese don de expresión a la hoja escrita. Su estilo de escribir es tan estudiado que carece de vida, y para colmo su vocabulario es bastante pobre.Como resultado, su libro es gris, seco y sin chiste, como un pedazo rancio de machaca."
4,graphics,the big problem for me with this board is that it has really cheesy graphics. you could always cover it with stickers though. it rides super smooth with good bearings. the board would naturally turn if you pushed. that really sucks. the size of the board is also really small. it is narrow only. besides it bieng narrow the size is good. it doesnt have great pop either. it is an awesome board.
3,Good light. Some quality concerns.,"Due to its dual bulbs (incandescent and fluorcescent), this lamp gives off a really high quality of light, and it's bright. Very pleasant for paperwork, drawing, etc. It's full-size (a little big really) and comes with a properly designed clamp for attaching to the edge of a desk or table.The quality is not the best. The lamp rattles quite audibly when I just touch the table, and tiny flakes of paint keep falling from one of the rotating joints. Also I have to hold down the ""start"" button for a good couple of seconds to make the fluorescent bulb turn on, which is a nuisance."
5,LAMPS PLUS Clamp-On Desk Lamp,"Prompt shipment, no damage package, product is excellant quality. Made a mistake in rating my experience with LAMPS PLUS and couldn't reverse my action (hit the enter key rather than backspace)..."
3,Good book (a bit expensive for its content though),"a good book in cgi/perl programming; a nice variety of programs and modules useful to all webmasters. however, a bit expensive! all of your programs can be found free on the net ... excellent code however, easy to understand"
3,Good if you're needing some examples.,"One of the best ways to learn a computer language is to look at other programmer's code. The Cgi/Perl Cookbook fills this need. Although there's lots of free code on the web, I found this book, and the CD that accompanied it, to be very useful. Highly experienced programmers may find the information to be a bit too fundamental."
3,If you are looking for subroutines..,"If you are looking for great subroutines, this book is a good reference. Most of the subroutines are very useful and readily available to use from the disk. If you are a new learner in perl or cgi programming, I would strongly suggest reading ""learning perl"" form O'rielly and cgi.pm book by Lincoln stein before buying this. After you finish those two, this book will make much more sense. I think this book is overpriced considering it's material."
2,The Cgi/Perl Cookbook,"The scripts are buggy and don't even work out of the box and they certainly aren't well written enough for a production website. The contact email address in them bounces, perhaps the author's gone into hiding in shame.On the plus point they do give some ideas on what could be done to improve a site, as long as you write your own Perl."
4,Great help for new CGI developers,"My favorite Web development book! Great scripts, terrific explanations of how they work, and a style of programming and writing that is easy to understand for a change. (The installation instructions could have been better, but the explanation how the scripts work, which I was most interested in, was outstanding.) I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to someone who just wants ready-to-use scripts, but for anyone wanting to learn about CGI programming it's definitely a must-have."
3,Get another book too...,"Lots of good programs, examples, and code snippets, but if you really want to learn something about Perl, then you'd better get another book as well. If you just want to learn some of the basics, or need some free code, then this book is for you."
1,"Don't buy it, don't waste your money","This book teaches you nothing.To grab a script and install it on your server? You don't need to spend money for a 656 page book for just doing that. You can download the similar scripts through internet for free even with manuals.You don't learn anything from this book. If you are novice in CGI/Perl thing, go for either Elizabeth Castro's quick start guide or to Jacqueline Hamilton's CGI101. These are the best books I have ever read on CGI/Perl. If you are pretty familiar with CGI/Perl thing, I recommend you Programming Perl of Larry Wall and Randal Schwartz to get even more advanced."
2,Examples too big to understand. Ok to use as documented,"Examples are far far too big to comprehend even by the experience programmer. They are good exampes and in the Matt Wright tradition, useful if you follow the customization documentation. The support section is also helpful. But the explanations leave a lot to the imagination and trial and error to understand."
2,"Lots of code, some buggy and no real CGI security usage.","What I really needed was a CGI/PERL/Security book. What I got was This Book, and it went back to the store the next day. I didn't like that the first line of code I saw lacked the -T (taint) flag, and it must be a 5.003 bug or me, but I could not use PUSH to add my library to @INC, but instead had to USE it. www.booksonline (SCBC) is offering this book for $15, and that is about what its worth."
1,Bad Book,"For a first time user, or for people who has never learned about CGI and Perl, I recommend NOT to buy this book. It is not helpful at all. It just make you more confused. Its documentation is bad. And the explaination is even worse."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"This book is basically a poor product that has been successfully sold. It is terrible. It is a lie! On the back of my book it says ""Jazz up your site with 20 exclusive, ready-to-use professional CGI scripts and subroutines--no programming required!"" It is sold as if it will satisfy the needs of people who do not understand Perl, while it is almost impossible for it to satisfy anyone, as it is. Hours and hours of troubleshooting and trying to figure out what is wrong is part of what you will get from this book. If you survive through that part of it, you will probably learn that it would be easier for you to learn Perl enough to do things in your own way. Buy another book. Find another way!"
2,Buggy and Lack-luster scripts,"Matt Wright has long been known for writing many freeware cgi scripts, and releasing them on his ""Matt's Script Archive"" site. He has also, for a long time, been the laughing-stock of serious web-developers everywhere. The release of this book, with it poorly written (and poorly explained) scripts just adds more laughs for us serious developers out there. If you want a really good perl book, get something from O'Rielly, as the ""CGI/Perl Cookbook"" is not what you're looking for."
2,The code in this book is terrible,"I friend of mine has this book, and I thought I'd take a look at a couple of the example they give, becaue I am trying to write a search engine. Their code, while basically funcional, has little real worth... the code is amateurish..."
2,Not impressed not a good tutor,"This book is soley a compliaton of the scripts the authors use. The documentation within the scripts are minimal. They do address all the major issues (i.e security, logging ect). The problem is they want you to istall their poorly documented and tested scripts and run with it. I need to learn the fundementals, not parrot/pirate someone elses code.In all fairness, I find buying techical books via a on-line retailer NOT A GOOD IDEA. Being able to tumb throug a book and look at the examples is helpful in deciding whether to buy it or not"
2,Good Content / Poor Quality Control,"This book features great ideas for scripts. Unfortunately, the scripts are cluttered with bugs.After downloading the fixed versions of the scripts, I tried to install the scripts on my server. The only problem is, the instructions on how to install the scripts is vague. Believe you me, without instructions, you are dead in the water.On another note, the scripts are only allowed to be used by the owner of the book. Sorry web developers, you are out of luck.In conclusion: If you want headaches and frustration, I recommend you buy this book."
5,Twisted,"The Oblongs - could be distant future offspring of the Bundy's, make the Simpson's and Family Guy look like Disney characters. Saw it on Adult Swim but frustrated with little air time, so purchasing it was a real win."
4,Oddly Shaped Beings,"My son (13) had never heard of these characters (neither had I for that matter), and he wasn't really interested in watching the DVD's after watching the first one (the pilot episode). He said it was lame with preditable, stupid jokes.Soon, after he had watched everything else, he tried this set again and proclaimed the rest of the episodes to be awesome, so it's a hit in our house."
5,far too funny to be NOT on TV,It's a shame they were pulled off the air. This family had something that the Simpsons and Family Guy doesn't have. You just have to watch it and find out yourself what it was they did have. :)
2,sour puss?,"funny idea. i would get more of a kick from the oblongs in graphic novel format (does such a thing exist?) -- as an animated cartoon, it falls flat. there's so much going for it: the artwork is great. the characters are odd & original. the charming will ferrell is in it (think stranger than fiction ferrell).i didn't laugh once.i was bored.boo. i wanted to love this.2.5 stars.6/1/08 - katie landon"
1,Don't bother,"This is possibly one of the worst shows I've ever watched. I turned it on on TBS and it was about 5 minutes before I switched to infomercials. This is one of those shows that tries way too hard to be funny, and fails miserably. If you want to watch a good show, go with South Park, The Simpsons, or Family Guy. Hell, even Barney is better than this crap. It's not even worth $2 much less $20."
5,great cartoon gone befor its time !,The Oblongs are coming to dvd ! its about time this great twisted show gets a dvd set. dont listen to reviewer T. Casey who wants you to be a Barney fan like he is. The Oblongs cartoon is comedy gold. How can you go wrong with a show about a deformed family that lives next to a toxic waste dump ? well how can you go wrong ?.... im waiting for a answer !
2,Pretty BUT torn in few months!!!,"I was liking this product. There is nothing special to it, but the cuffed part of the gloves was very pretty. Until today while i was washing dishes felt my thumb was wet! it got torn after a 2 months of use. i had these in the kitchen but i was just not getting use to of wearing gloves and finally when i did didn't last long at all!I think ill just buy regular one from the grocery store...there is nothing special to this."
2,Too uncomfortable,"My hands are small so I ordered this one. However, this pair of gloves are so tight and uncomfortable. I think I need another pair."
1,picture is wrong!,I needed red gloves for a costume.. THESE ARE PINK! What a waste. Fix your picture or at least put some info about the color in your description.
2,Latex,"Nice gloves. Heavy duty. Purchased them to use in a Dental office but they are latex. They come in handy around the house only. Due to the ever increasing allergy to latex among people, they really shouldn't be used in public places."
1,"Too slippery, no grip","These gloves are too smooth on the outside, which makes it hard to grip. Dishes and especially glassware slip from your fingers. The only plus I can think of is they're are easy to put on and take off."
4,The best I've found,"After trying a lot of brands, these are the best pair of gloves I've found so far. Wish they had a little more grip though but keeping their thinness. They did stopped the dishes and glasses from slipping and breaking while washing them. That's a lot!"
1,Color washed out,The outer color washed out just after 2 uses. These pink gloves now have a very ugly whitish shade on them.
5,Rubber Gloves,I have tried several different brands of rubber gloves for washing dishes and cleaning chores over the years--this brand is the best I have ever used. I hope Amazon never stops selling these!!! I bought two pair but am thinking of buying more (just in case)!
5,Perfect,Perfect! What more needs to be said? This collection was delicious and is a treasure for any Hardy fan. Enjoy every bite!!
4,GOOD DEVICE,The winder will accommodate two watches if you place them across from each other. The noise level is very low.The device would be much more useful if more extensive instructions were included.EDIT 10 MONTHS LATER: The winder has become extremely noisy - so much so that I can not keep it in my bedroom because it wakes me up! I WITHDRAW MY FOUR STAR RATING - it's probably a two star at best. I would NOT purchase another of this model.
4,watch winder,3 mode operation. would help if it suggested what mode to use for different brands of watches.
5,"Powerful, passionate, and compelling","David Corbett's story of the murder of a jazz musician is an utterly compelling read from start to finish. The deadly consequences of the initial killing, the aching hearts of the survivors, the alternating brutality and compassion of the all-too-human policemen - all are rendered in powerful, vivid prose that makes no compromises. Readers looking for crime fiction on a par with Dennis Lehane's MYSTIC RIVER need look no further than this terrific novel."
3,Will not last,"Chairs are really comfortable, but fist one broke within 1 year and the other one within 3 years. They do not hold up well."
2,Outdated and boring,"Studying outdated energy practices in this blisteringly fast-paced world seems like a waste of time. It dooesn't cover any of the newer technologies, it completely disregards biodiesel, it calls ethanol a waste without going into detail, and its long-winded historical approach doesn't teach well.Urge your professor to find a better book."
4,Excellent for the price,"I bought this GPS unit to locate the exact location of my telescope. I have also done some limited geocaching (4 caches) and have been able to find all four caches. It seems to be far more accurate than the literature and readout would indicate. I like the small size (easily fits into your pocket) and the intuitive user interface. It does not have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive model. However, I purchased mine for $69.99 on Amazon and received a $20 rebate. With free shipping, no tax and rebate, I purchased my Geko 101 for 49.99. It's hard to beat a price like that. I think this is an excellent introductory GPS unit. If you're not sure how much use you will get out of your GPS unit, the Geko 101 might just be for you."
2,"cant take a hit, not even from two feet","It is water proof but when it dropped from my backpack onto the asphalt (not even two feet from the ground) while I was on my way to the hiking trail from the parking lot it broke, the batteries were new, it didn't even turn on, the screen wasn't even cracked the slightest bit and even after i put some fresh batteries in just to see if it did happen to be the batteries it didn't work even then so if you buy a GPS that you can expect to take a beating do not buy this one"
4,Godd for kids or first time users,"User friendly, you don't need a more expensive product unless you need lots of extras. This unit does far more than I expected."
5,Pleased,The price was a fair price. I was most pleased by the quick shipment. I ordered a few days before Christmas and I received on Christmas Eve.
4,Changing the world,"'An artefact is a fragment of world alteration'. In an effort to change the way people view works of art, Ivan Gaskell - curator and lecturer at the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard - opens up a discussion of one 17th century painting by Vermeer, suggesting how art conveys complex ideas via purely visual, non-linguistic means. He also describes the interface between fine art and photographic reproductions, the relationship between art and museums and proposes that museums serve a therapeutic function."
5,"Once again, I'm impressed!","Hermann Baumann never ceases to amaze me, and this album is no exception. Flawless execution coupled with the highest sense of musicality make for quite an impressive display, especially with horn literature of this difficulty. Baumann rises like a colossus with this album- and if it hasn't already been said, the cadenzas are worth the price of the cd by themselves! For as long as I have been listening to horn music, I have never heard the beauty, clarity, and sweetness of tone in the clarino register as I heard with this album. The Haydn Concertino in D with Dale Clevenger was nicely executed, however my preference for this piece is in the Tuckwell recording for tempo and stylistic reasons. Cliche though it may be, this is a must have."
4,Correct attributions and works,"Michael Haydn Allegro (excerpt from Concertino in D): Dale Clevenger, horn; Janos Rolla/Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra.All remaining works (Joseph Haydn Concerto #3 in D, Danzi Concerto in E, Rosetti Concerto in d, and Mozart Concerto #2 in E flat): Hermann Baumann, horn; Jaap Schroeder/Concerto Amsterdam."
3,No option to choose a color,"I just bought these items, I just hope they will give me option to choose what color I would want. I have 2 girls and the colors that shipped to me are orange(this is fine) and blue(how I wish this could have been pink).First of all, I love the flexibility of changing the spout into nipples and use the handle to other avent bottles. It all fits so I can interchangeably use it. The girls love the spout because they love biting it with their gums, its really soft so I don't have any worries about it. The problem is with the valve, they cannot drink if it is placed. If not, they will get wet. Now I have to figure out how to help them drink using the valve, or drink properly without the valve."
3,"Expect to be disappointed when ""colors may vary""","The product is very good and my boy twins love them, but it's very disappointing to receive one pink cup. To whom I'm going to give the girlie color?? So take a second thought when ""colors may vary"" is in the title of the product."
2,Too many parts,"These work well enough as sippy cups and it is nice that the parts are interchangeable from bottle to sippy. However you don't save any money because all the parts cost more than most sippy cups. The real problem is that there are too many parts. Too much trouble to have to assemble and disassemble and make sure all the parts get washed and dried and not misplaced. There is the bottle itself, handles, screw cap, mouth piece, valve, and finally the cap."
1,This thing is useless,"The cup comes with a rubber valve (which is the ""spill proof"" mechanism). When the valve is on the cup, there's no way to suck the water out, which defeats the purpose of drinking anything from it. If you take the valve out, then the cup is not spill proof. My baby just turns it over and the water comes gushing out. This things is useless. We ended up buying another cup at Walmart that works wonderfully (totally spill proof no matter what my baby does and easy to suck as well), I just don't know the brand of it becuase it's not on the cup itself."
2,Too many parts and LEAKS LIKE CRAZY!,"I agree with the other reviewers. I have 4 of these for my 14-month old daughter and she loves them. They're easy to drink from but... THEY LEAK! They're fine when they're upright but once they lay on the side, they start to leak from where the air is supposed to vent. There's also too many parts so I might just have to try the Gerber brand."
2,grows mold,"Problem is the insert that prevents the cup from leaking grows mold very easily! Make sure you clean it regularly to prevent growth or keep it in fridge when it's too warm out. Empty every day before bed and wash immediately. It is best to prevent mold from growing on it - because cleaning the insert is close to impossible - in my experience. I'd recommend ""the Safe Sippy"" instead, or ""Clean Kanteen""."
4,Good cup.,We've used these cups since my son was about 7 months old. It took him a bit to get used to the difference in sucking on the cup vs. bottle/nursing but it that really didn't take more than a few days. There are a lot of parts (5 in all) to it but I run them all through the dishwasher (the smaller ones in the silverware basket) so it's not a big deal to clean them at all. They've held up well for more than a year and we plan to use them with the next child. It's nice that they are interchangeable with other Avent cups/bottles and they really do not leak compared to others we've seen.
2,"Spill proof and sip proof, too","I bought the 6m+ version of these sippy cups as my daughter has used Avent bottles with great success. My major problem with these cups is that they are so incredibly hard to get any liquid through that my daughter couldn't drink from them!We tried several times over the course of a couple months (she was 6 months when we started them) with no success. When I tried the cup to see if she was just giving up on it because it was new, *I* had a hard time getting the liquid out!So, while I think the rest of the cup is designed well, the handles are easy to grab, the bright colors catch her eye, I through the sippy lid to the back of the drawer. We now use the colored cup part more as an indicator that it does not contain milk, and have started using a Playtex sippy with great success.It's definitely spill proof, but unless your kid is a master of sucking, this very well could be sip-proof as well."
1,"Leaks, and hard to sip from","I found that more liquid came out of the sides and the vent hole than came out of the sipping mechanism. My son would suck on it, but the mechanism was so tight that the liquid would turn foamy. Bad for the tummy, frustrating, and makes a big mess."
2,what a waste,"unless your child drinks their cups laying down, which is highly not recommended, this cup is useless and frustrating. i tried for 6 months to make them work and they just don't."
4,Works well - but don't lose the plastic seal!!!,"My son (8 months old) picked this cup over all the others I had and it was the only one that didn't leak if I let him have it in the car seat or playpen. BUT, that said, there is a little plastic cap that goes on the bottom of the spout and if you lose it the cup is then useless. I'm not sure if this is the reason that this cup leaked for others but I managed to lose two in the dishwasher and when I tried to go without it the cup leaked all over thanks to that little hole in the spout area. As for not getting anything out I have no answers - it's worked fine for us as long as I have all the parts put together right."
3,"good, but NOT the air vent!!!","It would be a perfect sippy cup if not for the air vent. My baby loves drinking from it, we used it starting 6-7 months. Very easy to hold for the baby. I have two sizes. I like that the nipple and the cap are interchangeable. He even uses the tip as a chewing teething toy. But he keeps drinking it ""wrong"" way -- the air vent is down and that makes it LEAK. The only way to avoid it is to give the cup to the baby and control it while he is drinking, which takes away the self-feeding part. Other than that, I like that I can take the top apart -- you need to clean it very well, otherwise the mold accumulates in the tip and in all fine places."
1,"Should be Negative Star! Love AVENT, baby HATES this spout","I hate giving AVENT products low ratings, but this spout is just a poor design. It is very difficult for me to sip from with the regulator in it. Without it, the fluid flowed way too fast for a 6-month-old. My DS is now almost 9 months old and he screams when he sees the cup. We put it away, but forgot to tell grandchick not to use it. She poured a small amount of juice in it and brought I to my DS and he screamed so loud. My mom was scared and concerned because she had never heard him yell like that. I had a feeling she used the wrong cup. I came running out of the bedroom and sure enough, she was trying to use this sippy cup. Bad idea! We are using the NUBY sippy cup but are going to try to AVENT straw cup soon.Don't stress out your little one and avoid this sippy cup!"
2,My baby would not drink from this cup!,We have tried several different sippy cups and this was the only one that my little guy did not like. He wouldn't even drink from it. His favorite was the Nuby 3 Stage sippy cup which I highly recommend to rookie sippy cup drinkers!! ;)
4,"Great cup, not sure about the valve","I really like that I can pump straight into this cup with the Avent converter kit. It saves me loads of time and hassle with extra bottles, transferring breastmilk and putting together the feeds. I'm not sure about the valve. DD got very frustrated and we've just taken them out, but then, she's never used the valves in any of her cups."
1,Much better cups out there...,Pros: Easy for baby to hold. My daughter was able to easily grip the cup and put to her mouth.Cons: Hard to suck out of. My daughter never could get liquid out. I even tried to drink out of them and it was hard for me.When she would shake liquid would come out.Overall I would not recommend these cups. I prefer the Nuby brand. Much easier to drink out of. My daughter has done much better with Nuby cups. These are just too hard to get liquid out of.
2,Valves make it hard,"I used Avent for everything else, but these cups aren't that great. I like that they have measurement marks on the sides, but my 8 month old had to practically turn the cup upside down to get anything out with the valve in. He's just learning the sippy cup, so this one is bad for beginners. I also found that the air flow hole at the top sometimes leaks."
2,Not very good,This trainer cups do not work very well. I love Avent products but these sippy cups require a lot of suction. My 8 month old cannot get anything out. I could barely get anything out when I tried. I tried taking the plastic disc off on the inside but then the fluid just dumps out. I just bought a step 1 Nubby sippy cup and that is working much better.
1,mstrv,these speakers r junk cant hear them i put these in my truck the speakers came apart while i installed them tried to glue back together dont buy i should of just returned them
1,sound is terrible,"I bought these to put in my truck thinking I didn't need anything great just something that makes noise. BIG mistake, these sound terrible. they are being run by a kenwood deck pushing 22 watts rms, more than plenty. They sound like you put them at the end of a cave, hollow and muffled. you can crank them up real high, but they dont sound any better, just louder. Then there is the lack of quality, the tweets are part of a surround along the outside. They are barely attached by a minimal amount of glue that releases when it gets slightly warm. dont waste your money on these, at any price they are a rip off.Follow up, after ordering new speakers i tore these apart to get a good look at the real problem. these say they are a 3 way speaker, not true, the tweets are fake. the wire runs up to the ""tweets"" and just ends there. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!"
1,Not Recommended,I put these speakers in my Dad's Chevy Suburban. The fit just fine and I had no problems there. They are not well matched to the stock Chevy radio. It takes almost full volume to get any audible response from these speakers (very inefficient!). I do not recommend them at all!
2,not very good. Get the 3M instead,"Viewguard screen is poor quality. If you want something to protect your screen fromfingerprints, it's ohKay, but not for the money.The 3M is much better.Viewguard looks like they cut their plastic from any angle. The one my parents sent me is at a 20 degree tilt. I can see the streaks the little louvers make when I am looking straight on.the screen goes black at about 90 degrees. It gets dark after about 45 degrees, but it's just like tinted windows. You can still see everything on your screen, it's just darker. Not really Privacy.I can't say much else. It doesn't work as advertised, and is inferior to the 3M version.see the photos."
1,It does not work as advertise. It blurs the screen,"I had high hope for this unit, but it turns out to be a disappointment. The documentation says it does not blur the screen. This is not true. I can see black diagonal lines on my screen, and this is sitting directly in front of the monitor. It's bad enough to make it unbearable.As for privacy protection, it doesn't help much. It just makes your screen a little darker. I can still be seen and get caught surfing while at work. I also had my colleagues tested it with the same opinion."
5,Murray Review,"Amazing book. It amplifies the call to eternal peace, the ""rest for our souls"" we all desire. His style is used to make one hear the Scripture and fall at the feet of God for rest. The problem with the text from the first few days is it could lean, out of context, to perfectionism."
2,Bluetooth Transmitter,"I use this product with Bluetooth speakers that I use on the patio. It works fine but there is a problem. I was unaware that I should unplug the transmitter after charging it for no more than 4 hours. If it is plugged in for more than that, the battery begins to lose its ability to maintain a charge. There is nothing in the product information to inform the new buyer of that issue. Unfortunately, I now have 2 transmitters."
4,hard to pair,could not get this to pair with my motorola s9 the only thing that i could pair with was my lap top
4,ace decorative hasp,Good product but the staple should have been a little longer so as to accomadate the smallest locks without having to stretch the hasp!
4,A great historical chronicle,"The authors bring breath to the long-dead, and give a wonderful insight into the lives and times of Robert Bruce. It is a very intense, and sometimes raw, account of Robert Bruce's rise to the throne and the fight of a nation to become free. I would highly reccomend it to anyone interested in Scottish history."
4,a great telling of history,I saw the movie BRAVEHEART and although I am young I could still understand it. It tells about the life and times of (of course)Robert the Bruce. I would highly recommend this to anyone if they liked BRAVEHEART.
5,Another brave heart...,This is one of the most well written books on Scottish history that I have had the pleasure to come across. Its thoroughly gripping whereas other books about this time period have positvely made my eyes glaze over.It takes a deeper look at the politics and war of the time and introduces you to Bruce's fascinating followers James Douglas and Thomas Randolph. This book is a must for those interested in history.
1,Bad News!,This receiver worked well for a few days then it failed! Not built to last.I would not recommend this unit to anyone!
3,good quality for price.,"good starter subs. not too loud when cranked up, but hits well with the right songs. running 760 watts through them, sounds good, durable and balanced low tone. if looking for an inexpensive enclosure to start you off, this isnt that bad to get some bump in your trunk."
4,Good Card Holder,This card holder is great if you have the Pyramid Timeclock. Very easy to install on the wall. I wish it did come in a smaller size without so many slots.
5,Works like a charm,We are expanding at work and this was an affordable option for us here. The material being plastic makes it a plus too.
2,"Dubious factual content, not particularly useful","Earl Mindell has written several books on herbs and herbal remedies, unfortunately this latest contribution shares many of their faults. The authors do not specify which portion of the plant is used for many remedies and very little research is presented to support their use. Through out the book I had the sinking feeling that there had not been enough thought given to how dog physiology differs from human physiology. The skeptical reader may want to check out the quackwatch website for more information on Mr. Mindell's other books."
1,DOESN'T ANYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT PHONICS MEANS?,"I have a 3YO son who can read any word he can sound out like cat, sit etc.I got this set because I wanted what it promised - Phonics - LEVEL ONE. That is, words that can be sounded out, without having to learn about exceptions.Sure, it has those words in it. But it mixes them up with words like ""Emily"", ""friends"", ""funny"", ""fast, ""race"", ""down"", ""house"".A key to learning anything is to take it one step at a time. This author does not know that.So, this is not a level one book. It will be useful later on when he has learned a whole lot of rules and a bunch of other words. But by then, he won't need a book with only one or two sentences to a page."
3,Just average set of reader books,"Bought this set of early reading books for my four-year-old. At first, he enjoyed reading the books with his favorite Clifford characters. But unlike other early reader books, this set seems to have no didactic progress or consistent sight word identification. In addition, it includes names like ""Emily Elizabeth"" that are very hard for beginning readers to sound out. Save your money and get the ""Bob"" books or Starfall readers, which are much more effective at teaching kids to read."
5,Without a mission.. this is a good movie.,The pirates have crotch helmets. This is the movie where the guy goes. I AM THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL I GO TO! and so forth really fast. there are also police officers. I give this movie 3 stars.
5,Love it!,"I bought this for myself. It is a super cheesy movie from my childhood. I think I watched this movie well over 100 times when I was a kid. I thoroughly enjoyed watching again as an adult and sharing it with my kids who thought that it was super cheesy too, but enjoyed it with me anyway. I ordered another copy for my brother for Christmas!"
3,Trippy,"Oh my. I popped in the video and was transported XX years to when I was a tween. I can't tell you how many times I watched this on HBO, when HBO was a baby. I have not seen The Pirate Movie in oh so long but it was uncanny how I could almost recite the corny, tongue in cheek innuendos right along with yummy Chris and cutesy Kristi. It is so bad in a wonderful way. It was a fun and delightful trip down memory lane. My daughter is WAY too young at 8 to get to see this, but maybe when she is 18. :0)"
5,A Childhood Favorite 20 Years Ago Still A Favorite Now!,"I can't believe that it will be 20 years ago this year that The Pirate Movie came out. I loved it when I was a child even though there were alot of sexual innuendos that i didn't notice then that I do now, but the best thing about the movie???? THE MUSIC. The music totally made this movie what it is. Songs like First Love, Pumpin & Blowin, and Happy Ending are songs that stick in your mind. There's something about how the music was composed that makes you love it. What I'd like to see is a 20th anniversary edition of The Pirate Movie on DVD with outtakes, the trailer, a photo gallery and maybe even interviews, but I seriously doubt that this hidden treasure will ever make it to DVD, FOX just isn't smart enough."
4,Great movie. Left me smiling for days.,"Watching XANADU recently for the first time has sparked an interest in strange musicals and THE PIRATE MOVIE definitely fits the bill.Super hot Kristy McNichol plays a vacationing nerd on a pirate tour who blacks out and dreams about pirates. Singing and dancing pirates! One pirate doesn't really care for the pirate life. He meets McNichol, falls in love (who could blame him?) and is now torn between love and duty. The only way to solve such a dilemma is to...sing and dance!!!Based on Gilbert & Sullivan's ""The Pirates of Penzance"" the dancing is quite funny and the nonstop sexual innuendo and double entendres had me cracking up. I especially like the police squad. Those guys were hilarious!A big ""Tarantara! Tarantara!"" to Anchor Bay for the excellent picture and sound."
4,Got to love this 80's film...,"On the surface this looks like another typical 80's flick, with the retro hair-dos, clothes, and music, but for some reason you just can't help but love this film. Although not the greatest acting from some of the cast, Kristy McNichol gives a very good comedic performance and all eyes focus on her whenever she appears. If you are into laid-back musicals or over-all fun films, check this one out, you will have a blast - from the first shot of the cannon to the last!"
4,Another Great Random Comedy,"My husband and I LOVE comedies where funny stuff just jumps out of nowhere and leaves you laughing and pointing at the screen, saying ""What the f*** was THAT?!"" I noticed that most people who like this movie saw it first when they were young, but I saw it for the first time just a couple of days ago and LAUGHED SO HARD! It's such a bad movie that it verges on monumental greatness. As the proper definition of berlesque is ""parody"", this movie is the ultimate berlesque!"
1,unable to play dvd,Seriously disappointed have tried to play this dvd on three different players and everyone says its the wrong region and won't play. Now I'm stuck with a dvd that I always wanted but cannot watch.
3,So bad it's good....,"I was not one of those people who grew up with this movie; it was my wife who introduced me to this not-so-subtle remake of Pirates of Penzance. Lame humor, sight gags, and blatant movie references that don't reference popular cinema as much as outright steal them from movies like Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet you may wonder, why three of five stars? Not because I am a Star Trek fan, but because what you need to realize is that this movie is harmless summer fluff, and to enjoy it one must not analyze it too deeply. It also helps if you have a seriously zany sense of humor. I actually laughed at all the humor, sight gags, and blatant movie references, so help me. (Or was that ""cringed?"")"
2,Penzance Beware!,"Australian-made spoof of ""The Pirates Of Penzance"" with ""Grease""-type musical numbers, unbelievably corny comedy bits, and general non-acting by leading man Christopher Atkins, all saved by Kristy McNichol's exuberance, timing, and skill. Fans of hers would be wise to seek out something more special, as this kind of dopey stuff is really beneath her. Theater audiences at the time left this one shaking their heads...you may do likewise."
4,Good (slightly Cheesy) Fun,"I have loved this movie, since before I understood what all the jokes were about. You can't go wrong with a 80's musical pirate movie!"
2,excited to see The Pirate Movie?,"i remember loving this movie as a child, and watching it over and over on HBO (probably many times at the theatre as well). i was very excited to see The Pirate Movie finally arriving on DVD. another chance at a glimpse of my childhood, but sadly this one just did not hold up over time (for me at least). most the jokes fall flat, there is alot of singing and ""music video"" sequences to fill time the time. the DVD itself is nothing to talk about, with homely looking menus and no features worth talking about. it may be worth a look purely for the sake of nostalgia; it will take you back, but just far enough to realize it is over. overall, i am sure you could get your fill of this one as a weekend rental."
4,"Get out the crackers, it's a cheesefest!","The last gasp of the movie musical (and a cross between ""The Pirates of Penzance"" and ""Xanadu""), ""The Pirate Movie"" can either be taken as a truly awful movie or a clever parody, much like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" The music screams early 80's but is insanely catchy (watching this one afternoon with my young nieces, who adore it, I was struck at how much Kristy McNichol sounds like a less husky and more on-key Britney Spears), and the script is filled with laughs, both intentional and accidental. Thanks to HBO, who seemed to have this on an endless loop circa summer of 1983, a whole generation has this tape hidden in the back of their video cabinets and the soundtrack memorized! Christopher Atkins looks amazing in that uniform, too. A great hunk of cheesy rainy-day fun, definitely NOT to be taken seriously. Keep pumpin' ... and blowin' ..."
5,One of my allllll time favorite movies!,"It is very corny, but I have loved it since the first time I saw it! I special ordered the vhs way back when, and it cost me $60 cuz it was a special order! Crazy or what!"
3,Cute and harmless,A cute and harmless movie.... not earth shatteringly funny by any means but definately cute
4,The Pirate Movie,My children loved this movie when they were young. Now they have children and want them to see it. I puchased it for the grandchildren.
5,FUN MOVIE and GREAT MUSIC!,"I absolutely love this movie. Though it is far fetched, it's from the 80's, so what would you expect. I love the chemistry between Chris Atkins and Kristy McNichol and I'd love it if they made a sequel to this movie. I used to watch this as a teen and I loved the romance of it all. The music is great, there is some decent comedy (which I now fully understand) and the acting is good. It's a nice movie to get lost in for a little while and forget your troubles, chores, etc. I just wish I could find the soundtrack on cd for this movie though."
5,cute movie from my era,"The movie was cute Kristy Mcnichol is adoreable in this movie,The quality is great I love the way it is so clear."
4,Great fun take-off of the Pirates of Penzance,"This is a ""blast from the past"" - a new release of a movie that came out in the 1980s starring two icons from that era: Kristie McNichol and Christoher Atkins. The tale told is the same as the Gilbert & Sullivan operetta, but in a more contemporary (well, for when it came out) setting. The music is witty, re-written from the original in some cases, and fun to sing-long with."
4,"The best ""worst"" Pirate movie ever made, and a lot of fun!","I remember watching this movie on HBO off of a little 5 inch black and white TV when I was in my late tween years (12). Then, I thought this was just the best movie ever made. Now, I look back on it with fawn memories. I'm glad I have in my DVD library. Campy music, cheesy dialog, and a plot that never really seems to get anywhere. Over all great!"
4,Bite Marks?,"The movie arrived as scheduled and priced as posted. Play perfectly and my wife is very happy with it (one of her all time favorite movies??). The only thing, I was surprised by what looked like 2 sets of bites marks on the case, as if a dog got to it before it was mailed..."
5,love Cheesy Movies,"I am a child of the 80's, so no surprise that this is one I have always loved. Christopher Atkins and CKristy McNichol are great in this spoof classic."
2,Silly but fun,"I loved this movie when it came out and though it's quite silly and a bit choppy, I still love it. Just don't buy the DVD in hopes of getting much more than is on the VHS tape. The sound is bad, it has no subtitles for the hearing impaired ( I Had to sign the whole thing to my girlfriend who had never seen it) and the commentary is more about the director in his good old days of working with Walt Disney and other older projects. He rarely speaks of the movie he's supposed to be commenting on."
5,The best of the worst.,"I used to watch this movie with my sister as a kid, and I never understood the crazy sexual enuendos. Now I watch it and I'm dying of laughter at just how bad this movie is, yet I watch it all the time. It's definately a must see for anyone and everyone. It's so bad it's awesome."
2,Great 80's campy movie- terrible audio track,"This movie was campy and cheesy in a way that the perfect 80's movie always is when seen 20 years later. It was everything I wanted, except for one obvious problem. When the film was transferred the dialogue must have been low priority because you can't hear it very well except on max volume, then when they break into song it is very very loud."
3,Fun but goofy!,"I remembered this movie being more than what it was but of course approximately 25 years have passed. It was still fun, but in a goofy way. I'm glad I bought it because it's a piece of my youth. I really liked this movie when I was a very young teenager, around 13, and for no more than I paid for it, it was fun to revisit a piece of my past."
5,This is an unappreciated classic,"I loved this movie when I was a tween, I knew every song. I recently bought this movie for my daughter, now she watches it over and over and knows every song. If you loved Grease, you will love this movie."
3,Give me a happy ending every time ...,"I am on a Christopher Atkins kick these days. It sounds like a strange thing to say, but having recently discovered the tripe that he starred in has really done something to me. What that is, I'm not sure, but this is a movie that slipped under the radar. It deserved to slip under the radar, but going back to this hilarious song and dance takes me back to a simpler time.This is a modern day version of Gilbert & Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance. It's rather campy and silly with the off color humor, the hoaky costumes, and the typical Ugly Duckling story. The Pirate King is Fabio, Kristy McNichol is the nervous geek girl, and of course Christopher Atkins (who choose to embrace his teen idol status rather than fight it) bares his chest a lot.Have fun with it."
4,Wonderful campy movie,"I have loved this movie for years...there was no where in my hometown to find it and Amazon had it. It is a mix of humor, cheesy music lyrics and the sappiest of love. Great movie."
5,Pink Parasols And Pirate Kings,This is a wonderful Australian film from my childhood that I love again all overIt shows just how good Australian films can be and it's really nice to see it appreciated world wide now please put the soundtrack on CD
5,good,it arrived in very good condion and good to use. it makes me happy. I was easy to read and understand.
3,Tells it like it was.,I liked this DVD. It has good information on what it was like to live in England during the war. The actual film and people that lived during that time made you feel as if you were there.
5,excellent,"I bought Max and Ruby, they look wonderful and very well made. They look very much like they do on the show. My girls love them! (16 and 32 months old)"
3,Nice little gift book,I saw the video of I'm Movin On on TV and was struck by how the song just cut to the heart of what's wrong in so many people's lives. It was simple and profound and had catchy lyrics and I never forgot it. Today I found the companion book and although the pictures are terrible it makes a very nice gift for anyone who was deeply moved by the wonderful song.
5,Exciting Hurricane Story,"I liked the setting -- Grandma Linden's house, Galveston and the beach. There was so much detail that I felt I was really there and could see it. I really liked the characters (even troublemaker Freddie!), and enjoyed their practical jokes and adventures. I was happy to experience what a hurricane is like by reading this book in the safety of my bedroom."
5,Great summer read for kids,Ms. Lake did a fabulous job of combining very accurate historical details with an exciting plot and fun characters that children will easily identify with. A book that parents can enjoy just as much as their kids. My 10 year old daughter has already read it twice. Highly recommended!
4,Hurricane Story Engages Young Adults,"Fourteen-year old, Abby Kate Linden gets caught in the great Galveston hurricane of 1900 while on a trip to visit her grandmother in ""Galveston's Summer of the Storm."" Julie Lake saturates her novel with details that deliciously replicate the time period, from pearl-tipped hatpins to wooden crank-handle telephone boxes, a clopping ice-wagon horse, sawdust as ink blotter, and bedraggled German immigrants stumbling ashore at the Galveston wharves. It isn't until heavy rain begins with frogs and snakes washing ominously into the city, that the characters began to suspect the impending hurricane. Abby Kate's hair-raising experience is so realistic you find yourself holding your breath with her as she attempts to swim to safety."
5,Baroque,"""Combines kabuki and Dr. Strange in the mystical realm an alchemical journey by an arcane master..""Julian BeckThis right up there with Begotten and Eraser Head for the surrealism. This was and is, the first and onlypsychedelic movie. With rich visual delight and bizarre mylar chamber and costumes, the alchemy isaccomplished in jewels and gold, ah yes, it is, it works, it has been accomplished. I find it best played on atleast three digital projectors with heavy sub woofer and smoke machines. A most delightful package ofexperimental cinematography. ""The abolution of visual clarity and essential form"", William Burroughs wouldhave loved this film. A must have."
3,Inspiration,"Positive outlook on prayer, support, & follow through. If only we spent more time taking care of each other as women like this. We could truly run the world! Great read!"
5,Very Good !,"Again, Brenda has captured my attention with writing a juicy novel. I found this book to be extremely interesting about the ""Savvy Sisters"" whom made a promise to look out for one another.The sisters had a great relationship, respect for each other, and room for each to grow and find the right place and person in life which was the main objective. I especially liked the way each sister found a lover/husband and in the end, everyone was happy.... If only that happened in real life,I guess that is what differentiates fantasy from reality however, a great read, good story line."
3,Your run of the mill story,The book was ok. I don't think it realistic for all four women in the book to meet the men of the dreams within the same timeframe. I also think the title was a little misleading. These savvy sistahs are savvy in the sense of knowing whom to love. Granted it they have the rest of their lives in order. Still it would've been refreshing (and more realistic) to see someone do something with their lives that didn't center on a man. The reality is that more people (particularly black women) are single for life.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!,"Well it sounds like this did not happen to the other guy that bought it, but the ""pleather"" on this chair began falling apart on me, developing a white web pattern, after just 2 months! I was originally going to buy a used bentwood rocker for nursing as I was about to have a baby. We bought this one, at a retail store, not at amazon, because it looked really nice and would match our other furniture. No unusual wear, just rocking a baby. First the back of the seat then the arms began to fall apart. When I tried to take it back, I was informed the manufacturer warranties for only 30 days, so after 60 I was stuck, out $200 and a crappy-looking chair."
1,Short time chair,"Nice chair for a couple of years then the rocker and swivel bearings wear out. Don't lean back too far, it tips over."
2,JUST BUY THE FIRST SEASON,"This DVD is just the first 8 episodes of the first season - not really ""Farm Favorites"". I enjoyed them - but wish I had just paid a small amount more and bought the entire first season. The pig, Arnold, wasn't even in these episodes!"
2,Buyer beware,"Inside the cheapest cover I've seen in ages is a CD of various Mulatu Astatke tracks, from his now well-known Ethio-groove classics (i.e. ""Yekatit""), to obviously much more recent stuff. The latter is not exactly bad but the overall sound is not as convincing as that of his achievements of yore. However, one track at least, ""Tsome Diguwa"", gets close to reviving the old Mulatu sound, with good jazz-funk arrangements and good solos.This release is a problem in itself: there are no dates to be found, no identification of the musicians involved. The mixture of new and old seems throwaway, since this is neither presented as a new album nor as a compilation.This is not a condemnation of the music itself, which is generally worthwhile; but those who already know Mulatu will end with quite a few tracks they already know from somewhere else; and newcomers to his work will not find any clue here (the only date being 2006, while there are tracks from the early 1970s thrown in the middle)."
3,The History of Martha's Vineyard Dukes County Massachusetts in Three Volumes,"This is an excellent reference work. Charles E. Banks was a distinguished scholar of New England history, and of Martha's Vineyard in particular. Volumes One and Three are as good a source of Island history and family history as can be found. The Town Annals in Volume Two are of similar importance for early Vineyard history in detail.Buyers will want to take note that the one-volume BIBLIOLIFE publication titled ""The History of Martha's Vineyard Dukes County Massachusetts in Three Volumes"" by ""Charles Edward Banks, George H. Daen"" sold on amazon (June, 2011) contained ONLY Volume Two, Town Annals. The erroneous spelling of original publisher George H. Dean's name denotes this publication."
3,not as good as the cassette version it replaces,"I wore out my cassette version by Isabel Cisneros, which I love (five stars). I hoped this version on CD would have the same voices. But the voices on this CD are poor in comparison, the people do not sound enthusiastic, so listening is not fun. If only they took the old analog tapes and simply made a CD from the old stuff, that would be great. Still, CDs are easier to use to learn, because it is easy to skip the lessons you already know well.The book is the same, only slightly different formatting. The book is very clear, includes grammar lessons, not just ""conversational"" spanish."
5,Great recipes and easy to follow,"Just received the book today, and read through it. The book is quite easy to read. I've been looking at several clay and masonry books, and really like this one. It even gives directions on building an adobe oven, which I really would like to do (but, in the middle of winter, in Wisconsin, that isn't going to happen). I'm planning on making it a school project with my homeschooled daughters this next summer. I was hoping there would be a few more pictures on showing how to put the oven together, but, I think I can figure it out. The recipes really have got my attention and can't wait to try them out, too."
3,You can do a little better,"This is not a bad book. It provides a simple design for building an adobe oven. That said, I think a far better purchase is ""Build Your Own Earth Oven"". Much more detailed, and much more creative."
5,great stylish watch,I ALREADY HAVE AROUND 20 WATCHES.....BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT.....ELEGANT STYLISH AND BIZARRE.....JUST GREAT......U CAN T PASS UNNOTICED WHILE WEARING IT......A MUST BUY FOR WATCH FANS
3,band not ajustable,"tokyo flash multi color barcode display men'sdescription did not say the cercumference of the band and it is NOT adjustable. The discription says you can just press a button to see the time, However, after pushing the button you have to wait for all the lights to flash on and off 3 - 4 times then time is displayed for a very short time.I returned this watch because band was too big and it took too long to display the time"
1,Impossible to set the correct time,"Although the watch is durable and quite unique in appearance, it is still sitting in the box - I live much of the time overseas and took the watch from the US without ever trying it out - big mistake - it is impossible to set the correct time - the directions are very clear but the watch simply does not respond - watchsmith in third world country of no help - had never seen a watch like this - no practical way of returning it to Amazon - wasted $100 - I have bought many items from Amazon and never had a problem - my stupidity for not trying the watch before putting it in the luggage - I am confident it could have been returned with no problem."
3,Nice watch... but...,"It is a well-built, cool-looking watch. However, before you buy it, make sure you look into the measurements of the watch first. It is heavy and huge! If you have big arms/wrists, then it would fit you just fine. Otherwise, you would look like a person with a home-confined cuff. It is a great watch, but not for everyone."
4,My heart goes out to Mr. Eder and His Family,"As a former student of Mr. Eder's (and the former-Mrs. Adrienne Eder), I felt an instant connection to this book & the author. As a student, I knew that something bad had happened to their daughter, but I was not aware of the extent. This book is provacative, poignant and I must commend Mr. Eder for having the courage to write it.As a teacher, myself, I know that it is hard to put your heartfelt personal life out there for students (let alone others in the general public) to see...this crime was so horrific, that I can't imagine how this man managed to inspire students the way that he did everyday. He has been through Hell and it is inspiring to see how he and his family have carried on with such dignity and courage."
3,"I love Hartman, but...","...this is not the best edition of his work. Well, the CD starts with songs from his first recording (""Just you, Just me"", 1947) and this is so good (even when his voice could sound a little bit... amateur). But the next songs (tracks 11 to 18) taken from a ""mysterious session"" at Record Plant Studios (NYC) are just and simple MUZAK!!! Those tracks remember me the worst Julio Iglesia's performance, not because Hartman's voice (he is always great) but for the arrangement. MUZAK!!!The last four tracks (19-22) are fine but not THAT fine. Finally, I think there are no remaster here...Anyway, the first ten tracks are good. And if you want to buy this cd, PLEASE don't heard tracks 11-18. They can be a shame in Hartman career but no one have the right to put it on a record. Hartman is a god and he doesn't deserve this sort of amateur edition. And Amazon should have warnings about this."
3,Woman Detective,"Was a gift for mom and she liked it. I'm reading it, but I liked The 37th Hour book better, that's the previous book to this one."
4,Gripping,"I wrote a lukewarm review of Jodi Compton's first novel, The 37th Hour, which I felt was well written but light on plot. I'm happy to say this sequel is a vast improvement. With her dreary husband Shiloh now banged up (which, for those of you who don't know, is English slang for in prison) Sarah has become a much more interesting and less introverted character. She doesn't do a huge amount of detection but the three different storylines are engrossing and thought-provoking. I'm looking forward to the third in the series, although I have a horrible suspicion that Shiloh will reappear."
3,"nice, but just okay","The necklace is pretty; the filigree appearance of the silver around the turquoise is attractive. The turquoise stone itself does not appear to be real, although the ad for the necklace says that it is."
1,SUPERB!!!,"This band is by far the most musical band i have ever heard. Their hit song ""kaja kaja goo"" blends a catchy keyboard/bass riff while combining the amazing vocal talents of their lead singer. Actually, i must be completely honest with you all - the one song i have heard (kaja kaja goo) is the worst piece of sound i have ever heard in my life. i was watching the music video on an anime channel and i actually had the ability of seeing them in ""action"". There are no vocals, there is no real music. There is one ""melody"" which keeps repeating itself over and over and over and - well, you get the idea. In short, you cant listen this cd because theyre SO BAD!!! i didnt rate it, however, because i am basing this on the one song i have heard. And im actually not a kid."
5,Read it!,I want people to read Baby Goes to the Circus. if you like the circus you should read the book.
2,game is terrible dont get it (honest Review),this game is terribleperiod! dnt get itThere is so much glitches. its probally the worst gaming experience evr if your into bball games get nba 2k6!!best game ever. the dynasty mode is so screwed up..........i wouldnt even rent it
1,Save your money,"Low Quality. The philips screw driver is horrible, too small to use. Save your money"
5,Very Good,very handy for playing the game and the cover looks really good. there are extra things in it that is why it is version 3.5. the special edition part is more just the cover but is still very good
3,"Cool as a gift, but I wouldn't spend MY money on it","If you are wondering what to by the gamer geek in your life for Xmas, look no further than this deluxe editon of the PHB. With its rich leather look cover and beautifully redesigned pages, you will be a 20th level gift giver to your appreciative gamer.But like candle gift baskets and perfume gift sets, its a lovely item to get for free as a gift, but not something you would bother buying for yourself, particularly if you've already forked out money for 3.0, then turned around and forked out money for 3.5. Sure, they included errata in here, but really why should I PAY MORE MONEY to WoTC to get what I can download for free from the website?"
1,The good news is that it won't take up much room in your trash-can.,"I purchased one several months ago in case I ever needed it to siphon a gas tank. Today I needed it to transfer gas from my tank into a fuel can for a stranded motorist. I couldn't even get the hose down to the gas. The hose was so pliable and weak it never made it down to gas to get pumped.As with all things intended for emergency preparedness, try them before using them in an actual emergency.They had a gas can, so I ended up driving to a local gas station to get them gas. Funny part about all of it? There was a gas station 2000 feet away from their parking spot. It was blocked by an Applebees. Had I not been so single-mindedly focused on getting the gas out of my tank using this POS siphon, I would have used my GPS to figure it out.Chalk one up for poor situational-awareness. And chalk another one up to ""You get what you pay for."""
2,Loss of Reader's Interest,"Crofts all too treacherously arouses the reader's expectations with a dramatic opening depicting the sinking of a ship at sea, no lives lost. The growing certainty that the ship was sabotaged for the insurance and the disappearance of a private detective bring in French, who is at his most plodding and pedantic; indeed, the early sections of the investigation are among the dullest we have yet encountered from this reader. The plot is equally dull: the question of identity is irrelevant and hence anti-climactic, while the reader should be able to solve the how question halfway through. Bah."
5,Not as bad as I thought it would be,Overall nice basketball system. Biggest concern was putting it together after reading reviews. Not as bad as others made out as long as you have the tools. Best advice take your time and follow the direction. Everthing is marked and labeled good. I was able to do it in about 4 hours with the help of my 8 year old and 3 year old sons. If they did not help me I would have probably got done in 3 hours.I word recommend this system for those weekend warriors and the younger kids... If you are hard core you may want to invest in a model or 2 up. I do not think any other system could beat what I got for the price. I would also say I agree with the other reviews that this is a very easy system when it comes to adjusting heights. I think this is one of its best features.
5,Hoop review,Arrived promptly. This item is sort of difficult to put together but if you take your time the end result is great! This thing is very strong and will hopefully last for many more years. The kids love it. It is even pretty easy to move around when the base is full. Highly recommend this hoop system.
5,Great basketball hoop!,First of all the quality is top notch! My favorite part about this hoop is the height adjustment lever. It's easy to use and super smooth operation makes it easy for my wife or I to change heights when the kids are outside. The construction of it took about 45 minutes in my garage then I wheeled it out (base has wheels built in to use like a dolly) to the patio to get filled with water. Sand is recommended in the documentation because water may leak but I've had mine filled with water for weeks and haven't had any problems. This looks REALLY nice set up so I'm happy with the purchase and my kids think I'm a hero. Great for young players to adults because of the wide height adjustment.
2,Disappointed - Poor Product for the Price,"The backboard wobbles too much, and the springs on the break-away rim are too weak. Every time the ball comes down and hits the rim, it gives way too much. I like ""forgiving"" rims, but this is ridiculous. Combined with the wobbly backboard, it's a poor product for the price. Plus, the backboard was warped and had a dent in it along the top. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this until I had it all assembled. Not sure if the damage was from shipping, but the problem is that the backboard is made of plexiglass in the first place.I bought this based on the reviews. I agree with another reviewer - go to a sporting goods store and try them out for yourself first before buying online. I probably should have sent it back, but it would have been too much of a pain to put it all back in the box again after I had it all assembled. I won't purchase another Lifetime product again, that's for sure."
4,great hoop for the money,This is a great hoop for the price. Assembly seemed reasonable for what it is. Already enjoying it with the kids despite the cold weather!
1,Terrible Backboard -- Read This!,"I ordered one of these and, when it arrived and before I assembled it, I examined the backboard. It seemed thin and without much firmness, so I tested the backboard with a basketball. Good thing I did because the ball basically fell against a dead surface and the backboard vibrated like a trampoline, NOT at all like a backboard should!.So I promptly sent it back.Then, I visited 4 local sporting good stores (all national or local chains)to see what they had in stock and test the backboards of the display models. What I found was that ALL the Lifetime backboards are basically junk as are many of it's competitors. I am still looking for a portable system with the firm backboard like my old one (Spalding) but have not found it yet. Will keep searching.STRONG ADVICE -- Go to a sporting goods store and throw a basketball against the backboards of the models on display. You'll see what I mean."
3,A good beach read,I thought this book was worth a lazy Saturday. The only complaint I had was that I figured out half way through the book who killed Johnny's father.
5,Perfect summer read!!,"Great book, another fabulous one by Christine Ridgway- there are two books,was hoping there would be a book on the third sister, but cant find it as of yet. Great book!"
3,Fun Romantic with a slow start,"This was my 2nd book by author Christie Ridgway, I liked the first a little better (The Thrill of it All.) This one started off slow, I'm glad I stayed with it though because it was finally put together all nicely at the end. Fun romantic story with a small bit of mystery thrown in to make it more interesting. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author."
4,Love the Product; Not the Sprayer,"I bought the Outdoor Nature's Miracle because I needed a product I trusted to clear the odors in my kennel area. I have 5 dogs, a Great Dane, 3 Collies and a mini-Daschund and try hard to keep the area sweet smelling for my neighbors (and myself). I love Nature's Miracle in general so I was thrilled to see they had an outdoor product. The sprayer did not work, no matter how hard I tried; new batteries and everything. It just was not going to do the job. So I took the sprayer from my gallon of Round-Up and VIOLA!! Success!! I called my neighbor to ask how the air quality was and she was thrilled! I'll buy it again but just use my Round-Up bottle to spread it."
3,"A Brief Look at ""Brief Encounter""","If you love the film as much as I do you will read anything that includes the title. This is very short, interesting book that reads a lot like a final paper in a graduate film class. Lots of deconstructing and the suggestion of some unusual theories (did Laura ""imagine"" the relationship with Alec?). Nevertheless, there is enough here to remind the reader of the great lines from the film and interesting information not found elsewhere."
4,A LITTLE DIFFERENT,"Actually I enjoyed this book. It's a pretty short read, but not short on content. It doesn't contain as much vivid and gory details as most books on Iwo Jima, but what it does do is to introduce you to a warrior, man, and Uncle. The fact that this is not a first hand account of the battle actually enhances it. The collaboration between the author and his uncle makes a very nice read. I would reccommend this one."
2,Snyder's of Hanover Organic Pretzels,"Snyder's of Hanover Organic Oat Bran Pretzel Sticks, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)Only one word needed to describe these pretzels: DELICIOUS."
4,CactusCowboy,"This trap WORKS!!! Setting the trap is a little difficult for some. We trapped over 16 gophers on our ranch in one month over weekends. I have 2 of these traps and the wife just loves to catch these things that eat her flowers. The gophers sure mess up our pasture-land. The trap does work and you can be very successful with it. We catch 9 out 10 every time we set them. Good luck with your trapping, you will not go wrong in your selection. I am going to purchase more to catch more........."
1,Horrible product,Comes with no trap set up instructions. I am not dumb and neither are my brothers and neighbors. Nobody could figure out how to set it up
2,I should have gotten a Lobotomy,"I bought this CD after buying the Los Lobotomy's live DVD. I really like the DVD, but this CD is pretty lame. The playing is decent, but the song selection and performances don't do much for me. Plus, what's with the 38 second version of Purple Haze? was that a joke?, if it was I didn't get it. In my opinion the DVD and the CD ""Candyman"" are much better. Steve's a great guitar player, I just don't think this disc is on par with some of his other work."
1,I'll Take One....For Buying This Crap,"This is a totally different band than the Los Lobotomys that did Candyland, which was a great album. This is pure, unadulturated, fuzak. It's amazing how you can get this many Gold Medal musicians in one room, and get such ""Honorable Mention"" music. Luke, an amazing guitarist, a beast in fact; Will Lee, the world's most dangerous bassist; Jeff Porcaro, nothing needs to be said....and yet, this is just horrid, unlistenable flatulence, unless you're particularly predisposed to that type of sound. If you're into rock, forget it. If you're into Spyra Gyro (hold the sauce please), The Bumblebees (or Yellowjackets if you prefer), maybe, just MAYBE, this might be up your alley. Otherwise.....you'll wish for a lobotomy for buying this disc."
3,Further to this book...,"I read ""The Book of Grickle"" several months ago and felt a hankering for some more of the interesting antics of Graham Annable's characters recently. I saw ""Further Grickle"" and thought it was a companion piece to ""The Book of Grickle"" not knowing that ""Book"" is more of a best of, of all Annable's Grickle stories and that a lot of ""Further Grickle"" is in ""Book of Grickle"". The strips that weren't included in the best of were ok, featuring a curious cat doing silly things but the best work was stuff I'd already read. So this is a friendly warning to any Annable fans out there that if you're looking for more of what you read in ""Book of Grickle"", then this contains slim pickings to supplement that."
