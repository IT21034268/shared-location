5,Synopsis,"Inventor R4 is an updated edition of the R3 text. The R3 text is being successfully used around the country in schools and by users. I have expanded the text to include all the new functions for R4 and added additional exercises for those students. At 590 pages, this book is the most complete of any on the market for Autodesk Inventor.Elise Moss is an Authorized Autodesk Author, President of Silicon Valley AutoCAD Users, and a consultant for Autodesk."
5,Excellent book,"This is the best book I have about baking cakes. The author goes into details about how to bake the recipe. Explaing the different method to bakes cakes. This a book that every baker should have, bigger or advance. The recipes are wonderful."
2,disappointing,"With such great reviews and such a great reputation, I tried the very tempting cover recipe Devil's Food Cake. I followed the recipe with precision, sifting, weighing, mixing and the cake was just average. I used my precious Droste cocoa powder and the overall flavour was just mediocre. It didn't have an intense chocolate flavour you'd expect based on the picture (but that could be just my own expectations).I also tried the cocoa genoise and was very disappointed with that too. I found the mixing times were off - she indicated mixing for 3-4 minutes for the eggs to triple in vollume but it actually took double that.The book did provide some insight to the science of baking, describing each ingredient and their purpose, the lackluster cakes proves to be a disappointment so far."
5,Baking in a whole new light...,"I love reading books on baking. Just when I think I know it all I'm always learning more. This book is no exception. Great, easy to follow recipes for the baker ready to move onto the next level. Buy this book!"
1,Four recipes all failed,"I am getting rid of this book. I followed the recipes exactly but got very poor results. The eclair batter was too thin--the eclairs were flat and impossible to fill. The pastry cream recipe should be called ""pastry sauce""--also thin, never set up. The almond paste pound cake recipe fell. The white cake recipe had a very nice texture but shrinks a great deal as it cools. Overall I was very disappointed with this book. It gave me the worst results of any cookbook I have tried in recent memory."
5,#1 Widespread CD,"I recently crushed my foot(broken in several places) and have been recooperating with the help of W.P. Although I have been heavily medicated most of the time this is still some of the greatest music I have ever heard. I've been a Widespread fan for a while, but until recently I have only owned 3 of their CD's. In the last month I've purchased every CD they have. They just get better and better. I can't wait til I break something else!"
4,Nifty All-Natural Ideas,"This book is filled with many interesting things to do with flowers. Has lots of pictures and how-to illustrations that make most crafts accessable, but not for beginning crafters. Some interesting recipes and lots of good holiday ideas."
5,Wonderful ideas and recipes,Terrific book full of decorating ideas around natural materials and colonial Williamsburg. The recipes look very good also but I have yet to try any of them. Mostly this book was purchased for decorating ideas that would work well at home or in a church setting.
1,A Different Kind of Williamsburg,"I was initially drawn to this book by the front cover with its brilliantly colored fruit and flowers in an epergne similar to one I own. However, I was quite disappointed. The cover and title led me to believe there would be a much richer content, like the reputation and feel of the historic city. Instead I found more of a 4th grade ""arts & crafts"" theme. (C'mon, really.....dough ornaments, orange clove pomanders, gingerbread houses???) Many of the photos reminded me of an outdated late 1980s/early 1990s decorating style. (Ronald Reagan and Wham! called....they want their era back!) This book was a genuine disappointment. I would love to read one with more ""grown up"" entertaining and decorating ideas that seamlessly meld the Williamsburg of old with this century's take on freshening up the look."
4,LOVELY AND MYSTERIOUS,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
2,human engineering,"needs to have more wight on base and large suction cups on base to be secure while in hoz,or vertical use.it also needs lower temp setting for extra rare meat,and the addition of a fish temp setting for various thicknesses of fish,then you,ll really have something//////"
3,Not Calibrated...,"I purchased this product as a gift for my mother (and myself). We used it tonight on our beef tenderloin roast. To check the calibration we used this unit on the right side and the probe thermometer that is built into the oven. The Polder unit was a constant 15 degrees lower then the oven's unit. This was the case from the time we start roasting until the roast was finished. When we pulled the roast out and inserted a 3rd thermometer to settle the dilemma. My instant read showed 150 degrees- the same as my ovens thermometer. I will rate this product 3 stars because if it is always going to read 15 degrees lower then I can live with that. If it starts to fluctuate, then its garbage. Despite the 3 holes I put into mr roast, it came out fantastic. Its a good thing I didnt rely on the Polder to hit 150, or it would have went from a delicious medium, to a subpar medium-done."
3,Works Good; Nothing Special,This thermometer does what is expected of it. It keeps time and alerts me to the temp. of the food in the oven. I bought it to monitor meat mostly. I think that it was well worth the price and would recommend it to anyone that roast a lot.
1,Alert does not work,"The Alert has two modes (Low & High), evidently useful for holding an item in a temperature range...In any event, the alert worked only on the first use, and has never worked since. I have tested with hot & cold water to see if I might have been using incorrect settings, but could not get any audible alerts when temp went through ""Low"" and ""High"" settings.My old original Polder worked well for 15 years, and I will purchase another one of those."
2,Second use malfunction,The second time I used this thermometer it malfunctioned. I was making yogurt and put a lid on the pot and I guess it messed up the probe wire because about an hour in it started reading really high temps. The instructions say a 1 year limited warranty but you have to pay shipping both ways. Is this a defect or user error? If I send it back and it is not considered a defect I'm out the shipping costs and still no thermometer. The cost to purchase a new probe is almost as much as a new unit. No fun.
1,Lemon Engineering,Broke after first use. The temperature probe is unable to tolerate the high temperatures of an outdoor grill.
5,"Argh, international buyers need them too!",This item is immensely useful but so far no one ships the magentic models beyond the USA. Aaarrgh!
5,"Perfect Thermometer, Clock, Timer",Also you can define temp. ranges which you can be alerted if the measured environment is out of this ranges.
1,Piece of junk,"Mine broke THE FIRST TIME I used it. Don't buy this! If I could give it zero stars, I would."
1,Polder Cooking Thermometer/timer Model 362,This product appears to be manufactured to guarantee that the purchaser must buy new probes at a cost of $...each. My probe became inoperative after only two uses. That is unacceptable!!! Now I understand why other forums show so many buyers of replacement probe(s)-- this is a great way to generate an income stream. Gotta give Polder five stars for their marketing.
1,Save your money,"This is a poorly constructed thermometer. After one successful use, the LCD screen showed only occasional lines, rendering it unreadable.If it worked, it would meet a real need. I was lucky in that its illegible condition was obvious before I used it. If the screen went during the cooking, I would have probably ruined an expensive cut of meat."
1,TERRIBLE,"I used this thing once and it broke. I took it outside in the shade to test it and it said it was 130 degrees!!! Save your money. I wish I could sue this company for producing such a terrible product. If I could give it negative stars, I would."
3,Pricey probes dont last long,"The unit itself is very handy, and I'd love it if not for the delicate probes that cost to replace.I used my thermometer four times before the probe went out on me. I had the probe in the oven at 750F for 20 minutes and suddenly the unit immediately reads ""HI"" whenever the probe is plugged in.I'll be spending ... on a good frying thermometer rather than replacing the probe. I just don't trust them."
2,I trust this thing as much as a novelty fire extinguisher!,"I used this as a thermometer for steaks, roasts and such, and it worked 'OK'. While homebrewing some beer it was submerged in the boiling wort and 'kinda sort of worked' after that. We put it in the freezer to test it and my freezer was a whopping 67 degrees for a couple hours, luckily none of the ice melted in these temperatures. (Did you pickup the sarcasm? I hope so! Moving on.) The more I read about the digital thermometers, I find out most can't be submerged in liquid.I do like that you can set it to a range and it will beep when you leave this range, but I think I have to resort to a trusty analog thermometer for now."
2,Lasted less than year,"While it worked, it worked great. But then it stopped working. Only 10 months of use. Ordered a new probe, but that didn't work. Now, it's just an expensive timer. Would've received three stars, but the Polder site and service not helpful. Will try the Taylor model, good luck with analog Taylor thermometers. Once you get used to these types of thermometers, it's hard to go back. The precision in cooking, especially for chicken and pork, can make a big difference."
1,KER-STOP,"It was working great for about three months but now whenever I put the probe into the unit, without placing the other end into the meat, it states the temp is either HI or LOW (i.e out of range). How can it be too high when the probe end is at room temperature? 80 degrees is too high? Very disappointed."
2,Needs some work,I was very disappointed with this item. I had trouble with it the first time I used it. The temperature would randomly jump around. It seems there are some problems with the probe wire. I think this could be a very good product but Polder needs a more durable probe.
1,Keep Your Receipt,"I've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great. But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.One solution I've tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement."
3,Don't lose the instructions,"Mine has worked great, but since I can't find the instructions I cannot use it to it's full potential. There is no way to set the low and high alarms by trying to figure it out. I don't think a 13 year old computer wizz who has a knack for finding dvd easter eggs could figure this thing out. Polder does not list one on their site, let alone trying to find this particular unit. Since I don't use mine, it's lasted for many years now. LOL"
2,Weak magnet,"Works great except the magnet is too weak. When sticking on both a metal pot rack and an oven, the thermometer will stick but when you push the buttons just a little too hard the thing will go crashing to the floor. I'm on our 2nd unit and it still works but the clear face is broken off. One more drop and that will probably be it, so I try to keep it sitting on the counter."
2,Good while it lasts,"I have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as ""wireless"" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill. Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this timer even though I have had and used the former model for years and have considered it indispensible.The biggest disappointment is the alarm signal - it is much softer that the older ones. One use I make of the timer is to let me know when a stock is approaching a boil on the stove - I expect to hear the alarm from another room but with the new one that is iffy. Same thing with a roast on the grill. I need to hear it while I'm in the kitchen and not just while I'm close to the timer.I find the Hi - Low settings counter intuitive - haven't figured these out yet.And, a minor item, they have changed the way the timer display responds to the setting keys. The old model is fast and easy to control. The new one seems to have a slight delay or blanking action that I'm having trouble getting used to.The main thing though is it needs a louder, sharper alarm. The other things I can get used to."
4,Closer to Laswell Then Buddah,"I'm not sure what's missing from this disc that the first reviewer despairs? I haven't heard the first CD, but based on this one I'd be more then willing to have that also. I found a lot to like in the sounds here. I was dubious going in thinking I might only like the track w. Bill Laswell, which is outstanding in every way. What got me was I liked this album from the opening bars & it kept my interest very enjoyably going forward throughout. There is some very nice peripheral sounds incorporated w. the music that add a rich textural dimension. Also the percussion is coming from a large group of instruments & I love how they bounce w. the sound. Very little vocalizing, but that's fine by me. If you like contemporary world music &/or Dub sounds, give it a spin. You may find yourself wanting more. A solid album."
4,LaurenT,"My husband bought this helmet as a Christmas gift for his father (who is a huge Minnesota Vikings fan), and he got a huge kick out of opening up this giant box on the big day. While I'm not sure about how much use he gets out of it, it is an excellent addition to his Vikings collection. Also a great halloween costume too! The grandkids love to play with it, but be careful of the pointed tips of the horns."
5,Brillant debut!,"Didn't expect much from this cd... but I must say it is great!!! One of the best debut album in years. If you're looking for a smooth music CD, this one is for you!By the way, there are way better songs than ""Thank You"" on that album!!!I'm impressed..."
4,Dido: a haunting voice for the new millenium,"When I first heard ""Don't Think Of Me"" and ""Here With Me"" I had no idea who this haunted singer was. I only knew that I wanted to hear more. For me, she is reminiscent of the late and much missed British singer/songwriter Kirsty MacColl without the acerbic tongue and caustic wit. In fact, if you are a fan of Dido and have never heard Kirsty you should pick up a copy of ""Titanic Days,"" a breath-takingly eloquent album that never received enough notice in the States. I am truly pleased that Dido is reaching a large audience, partially from her cameo on the Eminem album, more from her college and easy-listening airplay. At at time in music where teenybop pop pap and rap dominate the charts, Dido, is a hopeful and much needed voice for the future."
5,This CD is impressive,"Nothing I could describe could do this talented songstress justice. I havent heard a CD this refreshing and diverse in years. You can easily close your eyes and get lost in her voice. The lyrics are interesting and the musical accompaniment is perfectly fitting. This is definetely one for the collection. I have one at home and one in my car (good ""sing along"" cd). I cant wait for a new release."
3,"Great vocals, but shame about lyrics","The voice of Dido is unbelievable talented and is just as good, if not better, than Sarah McLachlan. If the album was solely judged by the vocals - the album would be one of the best. Musically, the album is very good, but the greatest let-down is the lyrics, which lessen the appeal of Dido's vocals - which is a shame.""Here With Me"" - the theme from Roswell (TV), was where I first heard about Dido. ""Here With me"" is undoubtably the highlight from ""No Angel"". Other tracks that are worthwhile include ""Hunter"" and ""Thankyou""."
5,a spellbinding and beautiful cd,"Dido is extremely addictive. The album is uniquely ambient and calm, but at the same time hits you right between the eyes. Every song is very engaging and welcoming, and soothes me after every listen. Her voice on each track reminds me of someone differnt: Sarah McLachan, Dot Allison, Beth Gibbons or Sade, yet purely original. The beautiful and honest lyrics paint a picture of characters as the flawless production set the scenes. This album was definitely in my top five of last year and I assure you that you will not be disappointed."
5,SADE AND BAND REINCARNATE,"One night about a month ago I came home tired and worn out, fell asleep on the couch with the television going full blast. I woke up after midnight to hear DIDO singing on a late night talk show. I said to myself; Who is this girl? Who has this voice? Dido ended her performance and I never heard who she was or what the song was she singing. It took me 3 whole weeks with this melody in my head to find out who she was and just to purchase the CD. I know she has the greatest band that I've heard in a long time and her voice is the closest thing to the old Sade that I've ever heard. There is something so mesmerizing about the congas, and the brazilian beat that it will hipnotize you on the spot. I hope this lady is recognized for the true talents that she possess."
5,Plain wonderful!,"What an amazing CD! I remember seeing an interview with Dido on CNN, and I totally loved her music! Unfortunately, I could't get her CD here in Holland. Thank God she's finally getting the recognition she deserves! As for the songs: Right now, my absolute fav. is ""Hunter"". What a great song! When you listen to ""All you want"", you can just ""feel"" the story around it, just incredible. All the songs are great! It's a must-own CD for every music fan!"
3,Average album,"The selling point of this album is her voice. The album doesn't offer anything original and musically isn't great, but she does have a fantastic voice and if that is the type of music you like (strong voice but limited musical ability) then you will probably enjoy this album."
5,All you want,"This is an awesome piece of work from Dido. She is very talented. Make sure that you listen to her other songs that they don't play on the radio including ""All you Want"" and ""Don't think of me."" These songs accurately create the sorrow in a torn relationship. The songs are full of longing, spite, and regret. They're beautiful. These are also great songs if all you want to do is curl up in a ball and cry along with Dido. It's nice to hear we're not alone."
4,"No angel , just human","It was clear from the beginning that Eminem's princess Dido had a lot more to ofter to the music world than just Stan' s refrain . In her first offering "" No Angel "" she sings about emotional suffering with all the simplicity of a human creature ( "" ...i just want to feel safe in my own skin "" ). "" Here With Me "" ( one of the most tender songs to have ever hit the top 5 ) , "" Hunter "" , "" Thank You "" and the melancholic "" Honestly O.K "" are just some of the highlights yet the track which , at least in my opinion stands out is "" Don't Slide "" with it's sensitive and at the same time intense character . Nothing would have been the same ofcourse if it wasn't for Dido's warm , beautiful voice which is so affecting . An overall remarkable debut album withought doubt ."
4,a great buy!,"when i first bought this cd, i only listened to 'thank you' and 'here with me'. i thought this cd was only okay. but a week or so ago i popped in the cd and listened all the way through. i loved it! now 'no angel' is one of my favorite cds. dido has a unique sound and style. my favorite songs are: here with me, hunter, don't think of me, no angel, thank you, and slide. the other songs are great too. yay for dido!"
4,Angelic,"I first heard of Dido on the Sliding Doors Soundtrack where her song ""Thank You"" appeared and I was impressed by the sweet, soft melody. Also, I felt it was about time lyrics were more optimistic, and ""Thank You""s genuine lyrics actually made me feel good about relationships. Enough so that I went and bought the cd, and found that many of the songs didn't share this optimistic quality in their lyrics but did share the musical quality. The songs ""Here With Me,"" ""Don't Think of Me"" and ""All You Want"" rank right up there with ""Thank You"" but I don't think any quite surpass ""Thank You""'s happy message and peaceful melody. This CD is a good one though and Dido is definitely talented in this day and age where Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera get all the credit. Thank you, Dido."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,"This is the best cd! I heard the Roswell theme song, and had to buy this! I only bought it because of that song, but now I'm hooked! All the songs are great! BUY THIS CD!"
5,WELCOME ... To The Most Refreshing Album in A Long Time,"I was sceptical about purchasing this at first. I only knew the re-released 'Thank you' track (which originally appeared on the 1997 movie 'Sliding Doors)' but after one listen I was hooked. The opening track 'Here With Me' gives you a clue what you are in for: brilliant tracks. Sure, there are weak spots but in fact only one! Yes only one weak spot on the entire album - the track 'I'm No Angel'. Key favourites of this masterpiece include 'Don't Think of Me' (surely a possible single), 'My Lover's Gone' and the dance song 'Take My Hand'. Note that 'Take My Hand' could do very well as a dance hit if it got the airplay.I hope we hear more of Dido, as she is refreshing, brilliant and deserves every bit of success. I rarely give an album 5 stars but this one is richly deserving."
5,Best Make Out CD!!!!!,"I originally heard the song here with me on an episode of ER when of course the highly anticipated couple kissed for the first time!!! By far the best vacation, relaxing, snuggling by the fire CD since Sara Maclaghlin"
5,awsome cd,"Dido No ANgel is an awsome cd that i play every day after school. it is so soothing and all of the tracks are great and all have really great melodies. this cd is so awsome, i recomend it to everyone."
3,Very good,"to anyone that thinks eminem made dido do this or whatever: you're blind. Without eminem putting that cut on Stan most people wouldnt have ever even heard of her. And so this is helping her a lot. i love her voice, and most of the songs are pretty good. but like i said, w/o eminem she'd be nothing."
3,Not my favorite,"I bought this CD for the ""Roswell"" theme song. There are a few songs on the CD that I really love, and others that I find annoying. I do listen to it a lot, and I have to say that it grows on me. It's definitely not one of my favorites, though."
3,Eh....,"I saw Dido in concert, and the spark and variety she showed in concert is not reflected in this CD. This Cd has not stood up to the test of time. After a few listens, although her voice is pleasant and music is relaxing, it becomes monotonous."
2,Less inspiring than Sarah McLachlan and more insipid,"Okay.....my father likes this CD. To give you an idea, he like Alanis Morrisette and Iris Dement. This CD is unoriginal and uninspiring. It sounds like a cross of Sarah McLachlan and Portishead minus the inspiration. Personally, i liked ""Thank You"" when i heard it in Eminems ""STan"" but when i listened to the actaul song, it sounded lackluster and bereft of any cohesive mood or musical value....it switches from morose to happy, with not much reason, like a typical pop song. She might have amounted to something better, with her wonderful voice (which is either just very similar to or a rip-off of Sarah M.). The instrumentation is sometimes interesting, but they don't play off of it enough. The songs are catchy, but in the bad way. All in all, i wish my father didn't have this CD because i *really* dislike the songs and they always get stuck in my head....So, I think this music is a perfect CD for people who like *average* music."
5,The Best Song Ever!,"I have a confession. I don't actually own the cd, but I must say...the first time that I heard the song ""Here With Me"", I just fell in love with it! I would even listen to the radio all day just to hear it one more time! But every time the song would play, the radio station wouldn't say the name...that got me annoyed - very! Then, finally, the station said the name and I looked it up on the internet to find out what the title of the CD is...I can now buy it!"
4,The best thing to come from Eminem's latest - Dido,"I very rarely buy albums I have never listened to at least once. There are some exceptions, but very few. I bought this after hearing the few seconds of the vocal she provided to the song 'Stan', which was the stand out track on the album. But enough about him, Dido is incredible. One problem, nobody in Europe has heard of you, so get over here quick!The music is haunting, and every track is a winner. There is no filler on this album, which means although ultimately shorter than most, it is far more memorable.All I say is please come to Europe, flex those vocal chords in a few clubs in Amsterdam, London, Dublin. Then my friends will have heard of you, and won't keep saying I bought a CD by the dog in the Flintstones! NOBODY HERE HAS HEARD OF YOU! YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT! You are far to good to not be noticed.Kind of ranted there didn't I! Anyhow, buy this CD as I did, you will be surprised and delighted"
5,Dido needs to tour more,"I bought this CD after listening to a copied CD. Since buying this CD I have since purchased the CD and DVD combination titled Dido Live. I recommend both this CD and the Dido Live CD and DVD, because the DVD has longer and better soundtracks. The only problem I have is that Dido doesn't seem to tour very much."
4,I'm with the Bard...,"After picking up 'Faithless' last album ""Outrospective"", I saw Dido being featured in one of the tunes, and figured it was respectibility by association.So where does it lie? Dido has a great voice--a combination of Sinead and Harriet Wheeler--and most of the tunes carry themselves sheerly based on that fact. Good thing too, because the lyrics are mediocre at best.The album loses steam about 8 songs in, which in this day and age, isn't too bad, but the 4th star in my four-star rating goes for the bonus CD, which contains reasonably interesting (for a change) remixes and (on my Korean copy) one unreleased track.The bonus CD however, doesn't excuse the high price of the import."
4,Good for the store,"I play this in the store I work in. People keep asking me what it is and where they can get a copy. Its a nice and cool, calm sound"
3,what a girl,"Dido's album is all pleasant music that some might find a little bland (no big crashes or speedy beats etc). But this girl actually s i n g s for real - not that faux pop singing that pop stars like Britney Spears do, and not that faux rock singing that rock stars like Courtney Love do. And I heard she writes her own songs. And she's really nice and modest (almost shy) in interviews. Therefore, I sometimes listen to this CD."
5,Refreshing,"There are so many words to describe this album. It's wonderful, amazing, brilliant, and beautiful. Her songs are lovely like a breath of fresh air. ""Here With Me"" is a gorgeous opening track with wonderful music. I love ""Hunter,"" and ""Thank You""(great songs to relax to. ""Don't Think Of Me"" is a little upbeat, but it's still pretty. This cd is very calming and uplifting. It is soothing to the soul. I'd definitely recommend it. It's truly a gem."
4,"Returning to the sweet, melodic basics...","Whilst Australian music is usually my forte, here is such an album on which I feel compelled to comment about: its return to the basics. 2001 has seen many forms of music being not cluttered but pared down to its simplest form. Dido's savvy folk sets an example. The strains of ""Here With Me"" and ""Don't Think of Me"" demonstrate that which is the core of popular music - catching and storytelling. Dido obviously has explored this thus giving her licence to adapt it to both a contempory and 'old-school' audience. Welcome to the world Dido; and from someone in between those two categories, 'Thank You'."
4,A Heavenly Voice,People who like Sarah McLachlan are sure to like Dido. They have a similar style in lyrics and in tone. Dido gives us more of a polished and spiritual sound. Her lyrics are very nice.
4,Dido's No Angel is a must buy,"Dido's No Angel is a great album. If you like Portishead, Sarah McLachlan, Cranberries, or any of those other great artists, you are going to love Dido. For an album that has 12 or so songs on it and atleast 8 of them take on an instant liking to the ear; it's worth it to buy the album."
4,Hypnotizing,"This album is a thrilling & glorious surprise. I bought it- as did many others- solely for ""Here With Me"" & ""Thank You,"" but this album has far surpassed my expectations. A blending of sounds from Sarah McLachlan to The Cranberries, ""No Angel"" is not only a musical enjoyment, but a lyrical one as well. Introspective without being morose, strong without spewing venom, her words are as thoughtful as the catchy tunes that carry it.I have been listening to ""No Angel"" rather nonstop for a week now & like with many great albums, I keep finding a new song I decide is my favorite, only to find yet another the next day.Truly, truly, truly good. I am so pleased with this purchase. :)I highly recommend. (FYI: I would give 5 stars, but I reserve such ratings only for my most favorite & long standings artists)"
4,Grate,I love this music I got it becasue of the Roswell theme mainly. I did not even new who sang tthat song untill last night when I was flipping chanels and heard that song. I am so happy I know who it is and so happy I have there cd. I would have given them 5 stars but some of the songs I dont care for.
2,Not worth 14 bucks.,"You know how you buy a cd after you hear and love one song from the artist,and when you play the whole cd,you find youself only liking that one song? Well,this cd is a perfect example. It has one great,insanely catchy track,""Here with me,"" while the rest of the cd is a forgettable,sappy combination of Sarah McLachlan and Portishead. This cd suffers from two many cooks;there's about thirty (!)musicians,mixers,and producers listed in the credits.Plus, Dido herself(the lead singer) didn't write ANY songs at all;every song is credited to usually two or three hack writers. Again,the opening track,""Here with Me,"" is great, but every other tune is mostly generic trip-hop, with pretty bad lyrics. I'm glad I only paid six bucks for this cd(I got it used). I recommented just buying ""Here With Me,"" if it's ever released as a single."
4,Slim SAMPLED!,"I bought this cd solely for ""Thankyou"" which was sampled on ""slim shady's"" new song, ""Stan."" The album turned out to be awesome. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I haven't heard the songs enough to rate better :) :::bottom line::: if you like Sarah McLachlan, you'll like Dido. It's easy to listen to, and kind of new-agey. Enjoy!"
3,No Angel Has Angelic Sound,"This debut album from a girl with great vocals has a very pleasing sound. Some may recognize the first track ""Here With Me"" as the WB's Roswell theme. If that pleases you, so will the rest of the album. Tracks like ""My Lover's Gone"" are sung from the heart and full of soul. A great debut!"

5,ONE OF MY FAVES,"This has been one of my favorite cd's since its release over a year ago. I like to think of Dido as a Sarah McLachlan minus the wimpiness, Sinead O'Connor minus the annoyance ( I'm actually a fan of both ladies ) or Seal with ovaries. The lyrics are articulate without being pompous. The music is electronic-esque, without being cold. And that voice! Even Eminem likes her ( she's sampled on the new cd I think, or the first one ). Standout cuts are ""Here With Me"",""Thank You"", ""Don't Think of Me"" and the title cut. I listen to this cd when I'm on a road trip or just coolin' at home. If you like Annie Lennox or modern day Madonna pick this baby up."
5,An Amazing CD,"I've loved Dido every since I heard ""Thank You"" in the movie Sliding Doors. I first got the soundtrack in 1998 or so and then I bought NO ANGEL as soon as it came out. I'm so happy that her talent is finally being recognized. To any one who is thinking about buying the CD it was the best $... I have ever spent. It is well worth the money. Not to mention all the songs are great. There isn't a single song that I don't like and I am so picky about my music. So if you are thinking about buying it you won't be dissappointed."
4,"""Thank You"", a great song!","I have trully enjoyed the song ""Thank You"". It was in fact, my reason for wanting this CD. I have not been able to really get in to any of the other songs (probably because I have the repeat button set to ""Thank You""!) but do find that Dido puts me in mind of Sinead O'conner and/or Cranberry. Both of whom I have ""tapes"" (for those of us that can remember those) that I still listen to. I would recommend this CD to just about anybody."
5,A Wonderful CD with great vocals and lyrics,"This cd is great. I actually got it about two days before I saw Dido in concert, and in those days, I fell in love with it completely. Dido has a great voice, and uses it in spiteful and beautiful ways on 'No Angel'. She has something to say, and seems to find the best ways to say what she needs to. Listening to this record, you find that you, too, can be fulfilled by hearing this songstress vent her soul. I've got to warn you, I am a teenage girl, and in the direct target audience for Dido's musice. I found it incredibly inspiring, but, you may not. Instead, you could see it as sweet dreck. I recommend listening to the clips Amazon has posted. Another thing- this isn't a happy record, so if you're looking for up-tempo songs, this isn't for you. It does have an uplifting message though. Thanks! I highly recommend this cd!"
5,EXCELLENT BUY!,Dido is the best cd to come along by a female artist in awhile. It's one of those albums you can just let play til the end. I first saw Dido in Chicago when they opened up for Bare Naked Ladies. I bought the CD before I left and listened to it on the way home. 'Thank You' is my favorite on the disc. It brings out the good feelings one might have in a relationship. Most of her songs are about realtionships and the changes or happenings involved. One things for sure - She will go far for a very long time. Check it out everyone.
5,the karen carpenter of the decade!!! AWESOME !!!!,"being an englishman myself,its hard to find that right blend of jazz,vocal and rhythm without having to turn on the radio....I actually heard this on a friends car CD.....I just had to go out and buy it. If you are in your 30's...you will remember the vocals of karen carpenter....well dido is worthy of being compared with her....I'm flying back to england just so I can see this lady in concert....she is that good.you really need to be on that plane,in that venue....."
5,review,love dido's music when im sad for some reason her music speaks to me idk why but its really good too
5,A definite CD to at least sample if not buy.,"Dido's ""No Angel"" has a wonderful almost eerie quality to its sound. Her voice is soft yet very powerful and complements the instrumentals behind her music. The songs on this album are so full of emotion and power that there is no need for fancy techno sounds or heavy guitar work. The music and lyrics speak for themselves. As with any CD, you should sample it before buying, but if you're even thinking of buying this CD, definitley go for it."
5,Simply - awesome!,"One of the best CD that I buy this year. I knew Dido from her brother's group - Faithless. Dido's songs are more mainstream than her brother's. But, they are simple awesome! Either you listen each song individually or listen the whole CD, you will love it! I do!"
5,A MUST HAVE ON YOUR COLLECTION!,me and my cousin bought the cd for the roswell song but the whole cd is a masterpiece exellent song writing and the ballads are great since i love that kind of music is my all time favorite and the first song i listen to it over and over THIS IS A MUST HAVE ON YOUR CD COLLECTION!
4,"Heavenly Music For ""No Angel""","In my old neck of the woods, I'd actually heard Dido on a alternative radio station out of Austin with the hauntingly beautiful, ethereal ""Here With Me"" track, but my family back in NM knew the song only as the ""Roswell"" theme. So you can imagine my surprise when I came back home and started rifling through my Dad's CD collection; there she was. I immediately popped the CD into a player and was totally blown away. Her wry lyrics on ""Don't Think of Me"", and deceptively complex harmonies on ""Thank You"" make this album a real find. If you examine the other lyrics and songs closely, you'll see they come from a wise heart that knows the ebb and flow of love, and that it doesn't have to come only in saccharine pop-tart flavors such as Britney or Christina."
4,No angel like Dido,"Well a little help from Roswell and Eminem is really good. Dido should have stood out on her own and though it took a while for the buying public to take to her music, it's catching on rite now especially with Stan by Eminem being released. While u hear Eminem sampling parts of Thank You by Dido, the original is poignant song. The song was also featured on Gwyneath Paltrow's Slidin Doors years ago. Other faves include Honestly Ok and the bonus track Take My Hand. Dido sometimes sounds like Sarah McLachlan and exudes the same quality too. But she holds well on er own, no less. Excellent debut waiting to be discovered, more!"
4,Great Album!,"One word: DIFFERENT. Another Word: UNIQUE. Hmm, how about a 3rd word: INCREDIBLE. Dido is great. I just wish she did a few upbeat songs (only 1 is on this album) in addition to her awesome slow songs. Pop this CD in and you will hear a tale of love, emotion, and pain. You will be taken on a trip like no other. Dido's smooth and intriguing voice along with electronica beats make this quite possiblye the most unique cd of the year. Very nice work, just gotta speed it up in some spots."
5,BUY THIS CD,"If you've got this far in the reviews, you've seen all the stars and the praise. Dido is the best thing for the genre since Sarah McLachlan's 'Surfacing' and live companion, 'Mirrorball.' If you like Sarah, this is a sure-thing. Can't wait for the next Dido release."
5,"Pop fans, it's time to try something DIFFERENT!","So you can't live without the latest teen releases? Well,try out Dido's ""No Angel"" anyway. I'm speaking to you as a fan of MTV and pop music. ""No Angel"" an almost unclassifiable sound that you can really get into regardless of taste. ""No Angel"" is emotional, sassy, angry, and loving all in one album. This is where to find out what you're missing-a talented artist with a beautiful voice who writes her own music! So keep listening to Britney Spears if you want-but there's room in anyone's music collection for this work of art."
5,Dido's greatest album,"Love this album especially the ""Here with Me"" (a big Roswell fan) and also her voice."
4,"Really, really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Dido has such a soft and sweet voice and her songs are beautiful. My favorite songs are: Here with me, Hunter, Don't think of me and Thank you. I like all her songs but those 4 songs shine! Dido still isn't as good as Sarah McLachlan because her songs aren't as deep and are very light for me. She still is very good! Go Dido!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,3-1/2 stars -- Shows promise,"Like most people, I first heard Dido when her infamous verse from ""Thank You"" was used as the chorus for Eminem's ""Stan"". I don't really think people were paying attention to her when she dropped ""Here With Me"", but after the full-length ""Thank You"" came out, it became a hit, and people then started buying the album.Dido has a good voice for her music, and as I look at her material, I think that in time she may be able to reach Tori Amos levels of stardom. But I'm not necessarily comparing her to Tori because Dido's songs are more accessible. There are a lot of good songs on here like ""Don't Think Of Me"" and ""My Lover's Gone"", as well as ""Thank You"" and ""Here With Me"".I'm not sure if I'm completely feeling ""Slide""; also, I think ""All You Want"" and ""I'm No Angel"" could have been rewritten a few times. But this is still a good album. Whenever Dido releases a new album, I'll pick it up."
3,Hmmm...,"This is not bad. It does grow on one after a while. But it's somehow not ""great"". It's a bit too relaxing in many ways...sleep-inducing in places. but perhaps i should give it more listens. And maybe i'll even change my review. But this album seems to affect me in two directions...both thinking it's pleasant and interesting, and thinking it lacks too much.Perhaps it will leave you that way too.But songs like ""hunter"" and ""here with me"" are truly stellar. I think there's more to be found here..."
4,Most Enjoyable,"I bought this CD for the song ""Thank You."" Little did I know this entire CD would be wonderful listening. Dido has an incredible voice, she can sing all venues and has truly shown her talent in every song. D. Armstrong, writer, has an wonderful talent for telling a story in his songs. I look forward to more Armstrong and Dido."
4,Nine out of 10,"Why can't we have 4 1/2 stars. This is a great first album. Quiet, but groovy. Sinead O'Connor? No outrage on this album, and Dido's voice is altogether different. She expresses a happy sort of passion and has great voice. And, strangely enough, you could throw it on the CD player and dance to it. Great lyrics.Enough already, just BUY IT!"
5,Brings out ones every emotion.,This is probably by far one of the best albums I have heard in years. It can be listened to from start to finish and still leave you wanting more. She will make your thoughts soar.
4,Captivated,"I first heard 'Here with me' while watching 'Roswell'. The track absoluted captivated me - I actually got chills down my spine. After watching the closing credits on the show to find out who the artist was, I went to my local music store and was told that they have never heard of Dido. This is where Amazon has become invaluable! After a few weeks I had the CD and haven't stopped listening to it. Of course 'Here with me' is fantastic, but 'My Lovers gone' is also amazing. A top class CD from an unbelievably talented artist."
2,no trip hop,"please drop the trip hop comparison; the mere suggestion of it would have been insulting to people like massive attack and portishead. quite soothing most of the time, dido sings quietly with a hint of lethargy. this collection of pretty and laid back songs are inoffensive, if not prosaic. her singing works wonderfully on the faithless cds though. check out 'sunday 8pm' and the new 'outrospective' by faithless. dido works well in the context of a group and clearly she is a team player."
1,an unoriginal sleeper,"i don't know what the other reviewers hear in this ""let's copy sinead, fionna, and portishead"" artist. there's no originality. sinead was a breakthrough. fionna was piercing. but this artist did not strike me as anyone original or had anything original to share! save your money, cuz it ain't worth it."
1,Better than Sarah McLachlan? I don't think so!,"as if anyone with a brain thinks that Dido is better than Sarah McLachlan. Hmm, Sarah's voice actually has RANGE and she writes her own songs and plays guitar and piano which is more than i can say about Dido (wow, she can play the recorder, good for her). Dido's voice is boring and she has to rely on other people to co-write her songs with her. how can anyone compare Dido to Sarah, who has been around since 1988 and actually has a career? Dido hasn't proved herself yet."
2,No Angel....perhaps but she 's an Angel voice,"I ordered this CD because I had heard the song ""Here With Me"" on the show ""Roswell"" (first season in France). This Album is very relaxing like Lene Marlin. I heard th first song ('Roswell') and I begin to fly... until the last track. This album quickly became my favorite to wake up ,and all time on the day. I'm interested to see her in the future...."
5,GREAT ARTIST AND CD!,Dido is amazing! Every song on this cd is wonderful! if u like here with me and/or thankyou you should buy this cd everysong on this cd is good as or better than those 2 songs!if you have not heard of dido she sounds like a mix between alansis morsette and sinead o conner and her songs are amazing and soo full of emotion i guarentee you you'll love them!
3,has some good tunes but uneven overall,"I bought this album partly because of the Roswell connection and because I do like some of the tunes. I don't consider the album to be perfectly balanced but several of the songs, including the Roswell theme are actually pretty good. My personal preference would be for an Enya album because she's more consistent but Dido can do the job, it'll be interesting to hear her next album."
5,An excellent voice singing excellent songs making an top cd,"If your after a cd thats a little up beat, but soothing and something you can try to sing to then this is it.All around pleasing.."
5,Some of the most expressive music I've ever heard.,"Absolutely beautiful. That about sums up the feel of this CD...Dido's voice is a mixture of Sinead O'Connor and Sarah McLachlan, with a little of Sade's smoothness thrown in for good measure. However, even with all these comparisons, her voice stands uniquely on it's own as an instrument of power. It has an emotional edge to it that really makes you want to pay attention to the music rather than just let it play in the background. If you have heard and liked the song ""Thankyou"" either on the radio or as part of Eminem's song (I'll forgive her for that!) then you won't be disappointed with the rest of this CD...especially the first track, ""Here With Me."" I would recommend this CD to anyone!"
5,A fantastic album,"I found out about this album from the Roswell website and discovered that it wasn't available in the UK, so had to order it especially from Canada. I purchased the album specifically for the Roswell theme tune ""Here with me"",but having listened to the album repeatedly since receiving it I have come to the conclusion that all of the songs are just as good. Another favourite track on this album is the song ""Hunter"". I recommend this album to anyone that loves the series Roswell."
5,Great from the first to the last song!,"I'm really surprised by this debut album, this is really a great album. She has everything it takes to become one of the best artist in the world. Her debut album is really refreshing, it's great to have some new music, artist as good as Dido. When you put the CD on, you can easily listen to it from the start to the end. Dido is the best new artist of 1999. : ) If you love ""Here With Me"", the theme song of ""Roswell"", you'll love the rest of the album. Dido is definitely an artist you must discover."
5,Blew me away,"Like many people what drew me to this cd was ""Here With Me,"" the theme from the show Roswell. But I was totally blown away by all the tracks especially ""All You Want"" and ""I'm No Angel."" Dido has a voice that borrows its lilt from the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan and its dreamy smoothness from Sade. With an overall sound that resembles a soft core version of trip hop's Morcheeba, this is the type of soulful pop that should be dominating the radio waves. Most definitely the best cd I've bought all year."
5,"Okay, I'll Be Like Everyone Else.","No Angel is one of those CDs you play over and over and still hear something different each time. It has a sound of a mature singer who's dealt with her fair share of love interests gone wrong and bumps in the road. Dido, a former member of alternative group Faithless, debuted solo with this CD and it was the best choice of her blossoming career.The tropical sound to most of the songs incorporates a rythmic Carribean feel to the alternative rock that is Dido. Her voice creates an unusual atmosphere, ethereal and fanciful. Dido has a real career ahead of her and I can't wait for the next album!"
3,Pleasant Listening....No surprises,"After getting over the shock of the striking vocal similarities to Ebba Forsberg whose stunning debut was sadly overlooked last year, Dido impresses but takes few chances in what is a clean, steady disc of pleasant tunes. Just tinkering ever so slightly with the Lilth recipe for instant listenablilty Dido does add some much needed programed beats for a more urban sound but never challenges the listener with either her songwritting or vocals. Stand out track is without a doubt, Thank You and if her record company is smart will rush it to radio. Buy and enjoy but don't be surprised if your wanting a little more when its over."
4,Hunter..,"I looked at the Lyrics for ""Hunter"" and concluded that it makes an allusion to either the Greek Mythological Character Daphne or Diana. Daphne was a huntress, most regarded for that and not her (lack of) beauty, who Apollo fell madly in love with ...she did not want him though, so she begged her father to somehow make him stop chasing her and he turned her into a laurel tree. Apollo was a descendant of the Olympians, Son of Zeus and Leto and twin brother of Diana (Artemis)...Goddess of the Hunt. The reference could have been made to either one. Did anyone else notice that?Also, DIDO is a greek mythological character- the daugher of Belus, King of Tyre. Interesting eh?"
5,Amazing,Dido has a combination of sensual and romantic songs on this album. She's absolutely amazing.
5,One CD,"As an employee in a major music retail chain, I have to recommend Dido's ""No Angel"" as THE one CD to purchase from now 'til eternity. Dido is not my favorite artist, but she does an excellent job of putting well-crafted diversity of emotion on her breakthrough album. There is a little bit of everything on this album, which makes it great for every possible mood you experience. Like I said, if you purchase only one cd between now and the time you die, it better be Dido!!!"
3,Voice of an Angel,"It took listening 3 times to this cd before I fell in love with it. The first time, a few tunes jumped out at me, but they all started to sound the same after a while. The second time, more and more songs started jumping out and I began to think that maybe I was a little tired the first time I listened to it. By the third listen, I was hooked. I've had this disc in my car for 3 weeks now and the more I play it, the more I like it.Notable songs include, but are not limited to: ""Here with Me"" (or the theme to Roswell) which blends beautifully into ""Hunter,"" the feel-good ""Thank You,"" and the dreamy ""My Life.""I hate saying that a new artist sounds like already established artists, but ""No Angel"" reminds me of a Portishead cd. It's the type of music that almost puts you into a trance, it's so beautiful, but like Portishead, it's edgy and energizing at the same time. Dido's voice is like a lullaby and the music gets under your skin and calms you after a long day."
4,The word is out!!!,"This is the kind of cd you really have to appreciate. I totally agree with the positive reviews of the DIDO ""NO ANGEL"". I too discovered her music early on, and was pleased to see it featured in the talanted but underated show Roswell. Her enchanted tempos, and earthy voice have been compared to the greats of Sinead and Sara M. This is one treasure where you find yourself wanting to tell all your friends, but decide to indulge for yourself."
5,beautiful. lovely. enticing.,"I absolutely love this cd. I could listen to it over and over again all day. Every single song on this cd is worth listening to. Dido's voice and lyrics are absolutely beautiful, lovely, and enticing. If she enticed you in Eminem's Stan, you will no doubt enjoy all her other songs. My favorites are: Here With Me, Hunter, Don't Think of Me, and Thankyou. They are all so beautiful, uplifting in beat, inspirational in words, and never a moment boring or slow. The drumbeats are awesome and will leave you in a hypnotic state....in a feel-good way."
4,Very Good,"I'm strictly a hip-hop and r&b fan but when i heared Dido singing on Eminem's ""stan"" I was drawn to her voice. I must say this is a very good cd, this is coming from a guy who's music collection is 99.9% rap. She has a voice that is very relaxing it's the kind of music you want to chill to."
4,Intoxicating HypnoPop,This album is so pop i'm embarrassed that i love it as much as i do. But i do. So there.
3,Sweet. Almost too sweet.,"Dido has a great voice and a natural knack for writing tunes. This is a good thing.Dido displays almost no emotional change in her voice from one song to another. This is a bad thing.The best songs are those that support her tendency for monotone, such as the cold, bleakly desperate ""Honestly OK"". Dido's songs are weakened by her simply stating the words. She often keeps any emotions to herself, opting for a simple mood to each song. This simpleness gets repetitive. The one exception to the rule is the beautiful opener, ""Here with Me"". In this, every word is painted and toned, creating a wonderfully lush mood to the song. I listen to this CD late at night, when I'm already sleepy. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.I would've given this CD two stars, but I feel that she does have enormous talent. Maybe in the future Dido can release a more solid disc. Till then, I'll put ""Here with Me"" on repeat and hope for better things to come."
4,Perfect for relaxation.,"Insomnia bothering you? You'll never have a problem again after paying $ for this CD. No Angel by Dido is perfect for relaxing. Featuring songs such as; Here With Me, All You Want, and Thank You, her soothing lyrics will reach the depths of your soul. Ignored by record labels in her home country Dido looked abroad to gain attention. Due to the fabulous taste of the producers on the WB show Roswell her career began to soar. Then soon after even Eminem was using her voice (Stan). Dido's scintillating blend of music not only shows high class but also tantalizing style. Still early in her career already she is being compared to singers like Sarah Mclaughlan to Jewel. Watch out ladies this girl is sure to be some fast competition."
4,Beautiful Music for a Relaxing Day,"I ordered this CD with just the reviews in this column to go on. I had heard the song ""Here With Me"" on the show ""Roswell"" and had always been intrigued by who sang it. Finally I started hearing it on the radio and found out it was an artist named Dido. I listened to some samples of the other songs on the album and decided to go ahead and order it. I'M SO GLAD THAT I DID. This album quickly became my favorite to listen to in the car and at work. Her enchanting voice captures you with it's first syllable and you won't quickly be let go. The first few tracks are the best in my opinion. Then as the album goes on I do think the later tracks are a bit weak, but her talent shows promise. I can't wait until she makes a new album. I'm interested to see in what direction she heads to next. I encourage everyone to order it!"
5,"omg, this is the best cd","My message is plain and simple. If you don't have the Dido cd, get it! This stuff is a little more up beat than Sarh Mc. Laughlan, but still is mello. If you like Here With Me and Thank You, you will like this whole cd. My favorite tracks are: Here With Me, Hunter, DOn't Think of Me, Thank You, Honestly OK, Don't Slide, No Angel, and Take My Hand. They all have catchy melodies and her voice sounds reallie good. Trust me."
3,Versatile Artiste with Good Creative Flair,"Not a bad album with fairly strong opening track. But Thank You is definitely the best track of the CD. For 60% of the songs took a bit long to build up to an infectious melody. Based on this debut effort, this songwriter can go far and would do better on her next album."
5,Fantastic Debut,"Dido's debut CD ""No Angel"" has to be one of the best CDs of the year. She manages to master the soft pop/rock style while at the same time catching your ear with interesting lyrics. ""Don't Think of Me"" is one of the stand-outs on the CD, with a 70s feel to it. ""All That you Want"" has a bouncy pop quality to it while still being mellow. This is a CD that you can listen to over and over again. Great soft rock for good listening."
4,Great debut,"Dido makes a great first impression with her ""No Angel"" cd. Although not perfect (some of the songs do run together and sound similar), it is a great start, and I'm looking forward to seeing her blossom as an upcoming force in the music business, hopefully becoming as noticeable and recognizable as Sarah McLachlin. The songs ""Thank You"", bonus track ""Take My Hand"", and of course ""Here With Me"" stand out as some of the strengths on this album. So if you're looking for something soothing, but artistically creative as well, check her out. It's well worth the money."
3,"""No Angel""","After hearing rave reviews I eagerly bought this album. However I cannot say it lived up to my expectations in any way. Many songs are indistinguishable from one another and there are no real gems on the album. The best is really ""Here with me"" but even that can now be annoying due to being overplayed on the radio. I would much rather listen to Alanis Morrisette or Sarah Maclachlan anyday!"
5,Very relaxing.,"I heard the song on the radio ""Thank you""...so I took a chance going on that song and bought this CD. To say the least--I was very pleased. I listen to it a lot and I find it romantic and relaxing. Her voice is calming along with nice instrumentals. I highly recommend this CD."
3,Honestly ONLY okay,"""No Angel"" had the great potential to be a wonderful C.D.!But, when I bought the C.D. I was somewhat disappointed.I fell completely in love the songs ""Here With Me"", ""Thank You"", and ""Hunter"" They were Easy on the ears with meaningful lyrics and a great beat! But the truth is those three songs are what makes the C.D. worth listening to!Some of the other songs are okay but, if you just heard the three songs I just listed and that's the only reason why you want to purchase it than you may want to reconsider spending your money on this one."
1,Yawn!!,"boring, derivative, whiny, sleep-inducing.I guarantee, if Eminem had not sampled her unremarkable song ""Thank You"", she would be nowhere. She has a nerve playing STADIUMS across the country (which, by the way, have been 1/3 to 1/2 full). She's not a particularly good songwriter - she's wishy-washy and dull. Go spend your hard-earned cash on PJ Harvey, Janet Jackson, Sheryl Crow, Madonna, Eva Cassidy or Lucinda Williams - Chicks who ROCK! Not on over-rated bland 'pop' sung by a girl who got really, really lucky one day."
1,Very Coffetable Blah Blah Blah,"This is not trip-hop, nothing near it. Her voice is also nothing but show off... Out of these songs only ""Don't Think of Me"" (Couldn't find the relationship with ""You Oughtta Know"") and ""Here With Me"" really work...Musically she is mostly like the Corrs (which is not really a good thing) and her optimisim in her lyrics just really annoy me..."
1,weak,"boring, dull and lifeless this cd is definately not worth whatever you pay for it. im ashamed to say dido is the only english singer selling big time in america and i honestly cant see why."
1,One hit wonder...,"This is the worst CD I've bought in years. Only good song is track 6 ""Thank You"", which should really be entitled ""Thank You for buying my CD even though there is only one good song"". The recording of this CD is horrible. It sounds like they tried something new but it just makes her voice sound like cr@p. Don't waste your money, like I did, just because you heard one good song on the radio!"
1,Isn't Dido an '80's band?,"The cd says no angel, well, she sure can't sing like one. Dido is just flat-out awfull! The lyrics are depressing, the synthesizers are wierd, and Dido sounds worse than my cat after he's had to mutch grass! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HOWLING WITH BAD COMPUTERS!"
4,Interesting,"Well, I don't really consider myself a fantasy/sci-fi lover--although, Stephen King is my favorite writer--but his stories are just..different. Anyways, I was EXTREMELY worried about this book that I had to read for class. I was hesitant..because, cmon--unicorns AND talking animals?!Yet, this story was actually pretty darn good! I recommend it!"
3,lyrically written with little substance,"The last unicorn, a beautiful and powerful immortal creature far removed from humanity, journeys to discover where her people have disappeared. She meets up with an incompetent magician, Schmendrick, and a hard old woman, Molly, who go with her to King Haggard's castle where the Red Bull has captured the unicorns. A beautifully written and imaginative fairy tale (the details of the unicorn's character and style is utterly enchanting) that is more style than substance. Perhaps seeing the movie first ruined it for me. Grade: B"
5,it's a beautiful story,"I have never read the book. I've been trying to order and buy it for the last year, only to find it is out of print and may not be printed again. I'm very upset, because since I first saw the animated movie at age 3, I've loved the story. If anyone can help me, it would be most appreciated.luv izza"
5,It is simply Wonderful!,"I watched the cartoon adaption of the book when I was 8 years old. Ever since, the tale of the unicorn, all powerful but very lonely has enthralled me. Sometimes, unconsciously, I catch myself thinking back about the adventures of the magical beast. I can still rememebr vividly the scene where the unicorn confronts the Red Bull. I was pleasantly surprised when I found the book last year. While it is true that the price might appear hefty for what appears to be a simple fairy tale, it is worth every single cent. The tale remains as fresh and captivating today as it was 12 years ago. I loved it! I am now trying to get all my cousins to read it. You should give it a try too!"
5,reading this book is like walking ina shower in early spring,Every time I read this book it conquers both my mind and heart. I am astonished and amazed that such a mystic tale can be told in such a vivid way. I would really like to read more of that kind. Maybe it's that easy way of philosophy that turns Beagles story into finest artwork.
4,Why is a raven like a writing desk?,"Read the charming tale of a unicorn who suddenly finds herself the last of her kind to find out.The Last Unicorn is a true fairytale, humorous and dark,imaginative and clever. Peter S. Beagle puts a stream-of-consciousness spin on the most ordinary things, until one feels caught up in an intense dream.The Last Unicorn offers sharp insight into human nature, with the Unicorn character as the exact opposite in her bouts with pride and vanity.Why is a raven like a writing desk?---because Edgar Allan Poe wrote on both."
5,A Beautiful Tale,"The Last Unicorn is a magically beautiful tale. I love the way Beagle writes...smooth flowing narration in a calm tone, dotted with poetic and beautiful descriptions throughout. It's just pure fantasy. The ending is a bit sad though."
5,A beautiful book from start to finish,"I own the animated movie The Last Unicorn a childhood favorite of mine now i am proud to own the book as well. It is a beautiful well written book of the unicorn who hears her people are lost or trapped by the Red Bull hearing this by a butterfly who is quite chatting and such so she goes on the journey meeting up with the magician yet Mommy Fortuna tells her of The Red Bull and how it lives within the castle of King Haggard and the woman, Molly Grue who both acompany her on the jounery yet alas they are near the kingdom and well you ll have to get the book to find out for yourself of how it ends for I wont be the one who spoils it for you."
3,"A fine fantasy, perhaps a little dated","The world of fantasy literature has exploded and perhaps some of the classics of an earlier time are not holding up as well as we wish they would. I found the book to be a little simple and maybe even boring. But then again, it may just be me."
4,A classic fairy tale,"The Last Unicorn is generally a good book. It's a very typical fairy tale, though, and anyone who does not enjoy old-fashioned books will either be dissapointed or bored. It's a good book for pre-teens, as younger children usually cannot understand the story and older ones tend to scorn the usual fairy tale. All in all though, I enjoyed the book and, if you explain the book to your children, may be a good book for bedtime reading."
5,What other story can capture the heart of a young girl so?,"I must confess, I have never read this book. As a child I would rent this video time and time again, never tiring of it's wonderful beauty. That was ten years ago. Over the years I have remembered this tale, looking for the unicorns on the turning tides, knowing that I saw one there among the trees. Yesterday, I was in a store, looking at something or other. I turned, and there is was- the video. Since then, I have watched it three times. On the back I saw that it was written by a man named Beagle, which is how I wound up here. Everytime I even think of the story, I feel as if I am still 7 years old; and filled with a radiant all-consuming bliss. I love her and I she stood for-- for a young girl and a young woman."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE MOVIE.,"First of all I would like to say that the movie version of the book is great. The book however is not so good. The book begins very slowly and I lost interest, so I stopped reading."
1,Very Disappointing!,"The book got off to a rocky start. It became better during the part where the Unicorn meets the wizard. Then, almost a chapter later turned on a downhill course. I stayed up reading it until midnight hoping it would turn out better, but I was thoroughly put out with the end. Sure the wizard has a happy ending, but the Unicorn is forced to go around the world for eternity, knowing she is different from the rest of her kind. I found it a waste of time and wonder why many think that it is ""'Extraudinary'"" Unfortunately, 1 star is the lowest rating on here."
5,"A penetrating, touching book, surprisingly deep for fantasy.","I saw the movie ""The Last Unicorn"" as a little girl, and I remember being enchanted by the beauty of the unicorn and Lady Amalthea. I really wished I could be there, see her, touch her, be a part of the story. One of the most vivid memories I have as a child was watching this movie for the first time, and being utterly heartbroken at the end. But now that I have read this novel, I can pick up on the real meaning, and it's even more sad than before. One of the most endearing qualities of this book is its ability to leave you desperate to read on, yet also break your heart at the same time. It's so sad, I nearly cried. It brought back memories of how I felt as a child when watching the film. Yet unlike my childhood experience, I now felt like I understood why the story ended as it did. It's definitely a story I'll never forget."
5,Completely Magical,"I grew up watching the movie, and picked up the book to compare.Peter S. Beagle's prose blew me away. He uses the most gorgeous, enchanting descriptions without losing pace, and is the most cliche-free writer I've ever encountered. This book is older than me by a decade, and yet comes across so fresh and new, you feel as though you're witnessing a miracle. I recommend this book for anyone who loves fantasy, and especially for anyone who wants to write fantasy. Peter S. Beagle is the man to learn from."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but a bit of a let down","I'm a fantasy fan, and picked this book up because of it's popularity. People had kept asking me if I'd seen the movie. And if I ever did, I don't remember it.The unicorn was an interesting character, but became a huge let down and bore when she was 'turned'. I won't spoil it. I found myself expecting more depth to the story, and wanting more background and tales on it's creatures. But there was very little.It felt like a partially finished manuscript that had a thread of a good idea.I had to ~make~ myself finish it in the hopes that it would redeem itself. Which it did not. I will not be recommending this to anyone."
3,Am I just completely out of it?,"ok...I found this book to be incredibly depressing and it failed to capture my imagination at all. Beagle's use of language is one I can respect and maybe even appreciate for what it is, but i just cannot enjoy it. I never felt the true flow of the story. In fact, there were a lot of times when i found all the characters to be quite annoying. All in all, I thought the book was ok. The plot was very imaginative and such, but it just didn't appeal to me at all. But hey, if anyone wants to talk to me about this and explain what i may have missed, feel free to e-mail me."
5,One of the most beautiful books I've read,A unicorn over hears hunters saying she is the last of her kind and goes on a quest to Haggards kingdom to find if it is true.This is a wonderful story and anyone who enjoys unicorns and fansty should read it.
3,"Sad, really...","I am one of those who grew up with the movie, and dreamed about unicorns thanks to this author. Only recently did I actually pick up the book to read. It was very different from my childhood fantasy. The book is very sad and philosophical, not a light easy read. It is one of those very believable books, where, though the characters are princes and magicians and unicorns, you can understand and sympathise with them.Beagle deals with the thoughts on immortality very well, and gives a reader plenty to think about. The reason that I only gave it three stars is because it is a slow read, and I didn't feel satisfied after reading it. But perhaps that is what the author was going for, after all."
5,I love this book,"This book is fantastic, its great for any age, but I would say that it is geared more for girls, but not to much more. You won't be able to put it down, and I guaruntee you'll reread it over and over! Also, there is a not-so-well-known but simply beautiful cartoon movie of it, I don't kow why the new VHS cover looks so dumb, but its gorgeous, has nice music, and doesn't very to far from the book's plot."
3,Okay but by no means a classic,"I thought this book was okay but by no means a classic. I thought the story was interesting enough but overall a little dull. I thought the writing was okay but I noticed I got lost a little bit here and there. I also had to fight to keep awake reading it because it just wasn't that interesting. I didn't think the characters were all that well definied or were not as loveable/hateable etc as you would like to see in any book.Anyway, overall it's a decent book. It's interesting enough, it's a decent short and quick book for kids but it, to me, shouldn't have classic written all over it."
2,My Book Club Book Review,"I was not very impressed with this book. The characters were not very likeable and they didn't even seem to like each other. I came very close to not finishing the book after the scene with the butterfly. This book appears to be written in medieval times, yet the butterfly is talking about a ""sale"" and ""all things must go"" and singing ""won't you come home Bill Bailey..."" I sort of got the feeling that the butterfly was on drugs - or maybe it was the author... I thought at the beginning that the Unicorn would be a character I could enjoy, but she turned out to be not very nice either. I don't think there were any happy people or animals in this book at all, come to think of it...but, to each his own. You should give the book a try if you are interested."
2,Not That Great.,"I don't know what all the hype is about over this book. It reads like a drawn out bedtime story which takes place in a world with no substance or history. It seems like the author just threw everything together, then made things up as he went along. When I finished, I found myself thinking: What was the point to this story?The plot was as patched together and senseless as a dream. I think I could have spent my time better than to read this book."
2,Subpar Fantasy,"What can you say when a book does nothing for you but seems to be a classic for so many. All I can say is, there are much better fantasy books out there."
1,Can't Believe I Bought It,"Seeing how this book received such stellar reviews, I decided to buy the book without even reading it beforehand (I usually only buy hard copies of books I adamantly love), and boy, did I learn my lesson: People, popular doesn't mean GOOD!!! I couldn't bring myself to read beyond the sixth or seventh chapter, and now I'm mad at myself for wasting money. I'm sure this book was mean for children who tend to have a limitless imagination and overlook things that lack logic or reason, because I read this at twenty-one, and couldn't find anything fascinating about it!"
4,One of my favorites,"I love this book. It is transports you to the sea by which the last unicorn must stand. If you've seen the movie, you must read the book. If you've not seen the movie, then please read the book. This is a great read for pre-teens all the way through adults."
5,GREAT BOOK,"this was an excellent books for children and adults alike. it was a truly amazing, interesting fantasy. This intriguing novel will leave you with a mystical sort of sensation. I recommend you buy or order this fantastic novel now. I loved it."
5,A different kind of fantasy,The last unicorn is unlike any kind of fantasy book I've ever read. The world is so fanciful that I feel like I must cling to the narrative or be swept away by a world that simply does not have the same rules for reality. Beautifully worded and touching to the core.
5,Product well received....,"This story is one of my all time favorites. Growing up with the motion picture as a little child, it had never occurred to me to read the novel that preceded its birth. The imagery in Beagle's words is comparable to the Arabian Nights as well as the Grim Brothers' fairy tales. He spins a world that tantalizes and swells in your mind the longer you leave the book down.That being said, the product itself was in fabulous condition. The packaging wasn't overly humongous and the bubble wrap around it was more than enough to protect the book from physical damage. It came in new, just as it was sold and the price was more than fair (bought with a prime account)."
5,Alive with dimension and fantasy,"This is a richly detail book. It glows with the feeling of lost remembrance and regret. The unicorn, all alone in her single existence, must learn to force change into the closed world in which she lives and Schmendrick, the fumbling magician must release his power as Nikos had forseen. The characters of King Haggard and Prince Lir show the opposite lives which can be lived and the different paths which can be taken. A truly captivating book with intense expression and depth."
5,Best adult and child-proof fantasy book I have ever read.,"I grew up on the movie and didn't know that it came from a book until 5th grade. When I read the book I felt so many emotions. Pain, pleasure happiness. Now a college freshman I realize that the book hold alot of meaning. I have had all my friends read my copy, and most have bought their own."
1,useless,This book is nearly useless for the practicing pathologist. Topics covered are limited. Not recommended as a text book or quick reference.
5,Freddy Jones Waiting for the Night,"I purchased this CD as a gift for my husband's 50 birthday. He LOVED his CD and has played it at least once or twice a day before leaving for work. He says the music from this CD inspired him through some of the toughest times of his life and it still seems to energize him and make him happier as he faces the work day ahead at this more peaceful, stable time in his life! Great product. Many thanks for making it available to us!!"
3,"Love ""In a Daydream"".","Country-tinged Rock, I was drawn in by ""In a Daydream"", but didn't find anything else here for me. Competent at all of it - song-writing, lyrics, playing, singing - they just didn't connect with me, that's all, other than ""In a Daydream"", which is about as good as a song could ever be."
5,if youre a fan theyre cool,"i liked these because theyre understated and they dont advertise the place i bought my Avalanche.theyre all plastic but i had no problem putting them on, only took a couple of minutes and a screwdriver."
5,thione ballago seck,I first heard him when I went to get my hair braided by a Senegalwoman. I fell in love instantly. His voice is so unique andpowerful. Many people have said they like Youssou Ndour betterBut I will always love Thione Seck because of his ability touse all of his emotion in a song.
5,ABSOLUTELY A SMASH HIT!,"16 of the 17 songs on this album are absolute keepers. Imaginary Diva I didn't like at all, but others might find it enjoyable. It is a major departure from the boys normal musical style. The other 16 songs are great. I Want To Grow Old With You is hauntingly beautiful and romantic beyond belief. Every song has great lyrics, great harmonies, great arrangements. If you are a Westlife Fan, buy this, listen to this, and fall in love with their music all over again."
2,Boys....boys....boys,"i am slightly disappointed!!. i have been a die hard westlife fan since their days on the smash hits tour. what a load of lifeless drivel. why choose such melancholy and tedious songs to add to your own written style of heartfelt emotions. The boys own songs were a breathe of fresh air from the stagnant CD. 1 decent song though is Angel, amazing vocal talent by Shane and Bryan also it has been proven to all your critics you can play instruments, and very well in Kians case. I would like to say however, Kian and Nicky where have you been hiding those voices? your lead vocals were equally as good if not better than the other 3. 'What aim i doing without you' has good lyrics but boys your voices need to be showed off in those ballads we all love so VERY VERY much, especially Kian and Nicky.A refreshing change, next time stick to your own material and make the album truly your own. I still luv ya though. x x x"
2,westlife keeps giving us dispapointment.,"westlife used to be good. Their first album is simply great, the songs are simple and radio friendly but as the release of their second album, coast to coast it seems that they are getting worser.The songs are all ballad nothing but plain old ballad and nothing is special about this album although I admit that their vocal keeps getting better but it does not mean that westlife should sing plain old ballad, they should try RnB, hip-hop,rap instead.frankly, there is really nothing worth in this album it keeps on repeating and repeating the same old things.I'm not talking nonsense, I've tried before listening to the album, but nothing came out of it.Believe me, what I've said is absoblutely true try it if you do not believe me."
1,Mediocre...even for a boy band...,"It's...OK. Westlife have once again managed to combine a saccharine combination of happy pop tune (When You're Looking Like That) and nicer, sweeter ballads (Queen of My Heart).Whoever suggested, however, that they cover Sarah McLachlan's superb 'Angel' should be fired immediately. I cringed, I cringed again, and I'm still cringing. Shane's voice quite simply doesn't have the necessary vocal range.And considering the average age of a Westlife fan is 8, was it a good idea to put a song about death on the album? I wouldn't have thought so..."
4,"Yes, it is a WORLD OF THEIR OWN, A GREAT WORLD!!","As a fan of Westlife's other two releases, WESTLIFE and COAST TO COAST, I was very happy to purchase an import of their newest release, WORLD OF OUR OWN. It is definitely putting them on a path to a long lasting career. Their voices are much more mature and blend better together now. The standout tracks are QUEEN OF MY HEART, BOP BOP BABY, I CRY, WORLD OF OUR OWN, WHEN YOU COME AROUND, WALK AWAY, and Sarah McLachlan's ANGEL but all of them are good!! I hope on their next release they work on more personal songs and don't just try to rush out another release....given the right songs, they would be more than just good, they would be great by showing more emotional depths in their voices!!! But still, way to go again guys!"
3,Well maybe better than okay,I really like several of the songs a lot but am not sure I want to order another of their albums. Their slow songs are the favorite and I guess that shows my age. Haha
3,Half Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this. It clearly shows two mounts in the pictures, yet the cost is for only one. I attempted to clarify it before I ordered, and there was no way to get an answer. It is another HOAX to get you to think you are getting a great deal, when you can get a much better deal at other outlets. The site is not user friendly, I would beware before you purchase anything if the price seems great, it may just be another hoax to get your money. Never buy from anyone who you can not ask a direct question to. This was a BAD PURCHASE!!!!!!!!"
3,Better than nothing,"I'm sure it depends on the bike you're using this on. But for me personally, I still get spray on the back of my jacket. Undoubtedly less than I would without this, but don't expect this product to keep you entirely clean and dry. For the price, it is definitely an improvement over having nothing."
3,"OK, but works better when modded.","Does most of the job cheaply... I modified mine with a section of milk carton held in place with a zip tie to block water from getting through the narrow pivot/mounting bracket section.If you want an effective, no hassle, (but ugly), way to block mud from getting through the weak point, just tie a plastic shopping bag around the pivot joint.A helpful thing about this fender is that it can be adjusted to work with a full suspesion bike. I dissasembled the pivot jount and flipped the mounting section to get a more extreme angle, so the fender would clear the back wheel whith the suspension bottomed out (7 inches of travel on that baby!)To get enough clearance I had to mount the fender on the seat post rather rhan the down tube. but it still works OK. A little bit of mud and water get past the fender, since it is so far from the tire, but is's better than it was with nothing there."
2,"Good value, but beware if you have big knees","Excellent value for the money but watch out if you have thick/fat legs at the knee. My leg measures 22 inches circumference just below the knee and I found these socks too painful to wear for more than a couple of hours. I suspect they would be just fine for someone whose below-the-knee measurement was 18-19 inches. Otherwise the socks are well made and quite comfortable. I ended up switching to Jobst socks -- pricy, but good for a big guy to wear all day!"
1,Skip this book,"As other reviewers have said, it's shallow, riddled with errors, and ultimately unsatisfying. Yet it mentions a lot of incidents, some of which I'd never heard of, like the Queen Mary colliding with her escort. This book's salvation would be a good bibiography, so the interested reader could follow up -- but there is none. No notes. Nothing. For a good book of this sort, read ""From the Jaws of Victory"", by Charles Fair."
2,Decidedly Underwhelming,"This book was prepared as a companion to a History Channel series and it has the depth and detail one would expect from a television program. As some of the other reviewers have noted, there are sporadic factual mistakes, but the greater shortcoming, to my mind, is the lack of much to say. The factual issues discussed are pretty much common knowledge to anyone having much familiarity at all with military history (or history in general) in the Twentieth Century. Worse yet, the insights and commentary provided are little more than unimaginitive ""conventional wisdom."" I had some suspicions about this book being of a mass market paperback quality, but I picked it up because it was one of the first in .mp3 audio format. This proved to be a mistake as my first concerns were conclusively proven correct."
1,Idiotic Infamy,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read on military history. You have to wonder how someone can get a book like this published. The author is a journalist, but even that is usually not a disqualifying factor with a book on military history, or any sort of history for that matter. Journalists, after all, deal in fact also.In this case, however, the book is filled with factual errors, and you get the idea that the author sometimes missed the point of a battle or campaign that he was recounting to you. Given that he's so often mistaken about what happened, it's not much of a surprise that his interpretations are going to be poor also.All of this leads to my final conclusion. I would avoid this book at all costs. I don't get rid of any book that's non-fiction, usually, but this one's going to the used bookstore. I expect them to reject it, and I'll probably wind up giving it to the library, who will overprice it in their book sale at $1.00."
3,VERY INFORMATIVE. TOO BAD WE CONTINUED TO MAKE THEM,"I ENJOYED THE FACTS. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TEACHING THE BLUNDERS IN ALL OF OUR MILITARY SCHOOLS FROM THE TIME THE FIRST ONES WERE MADE. HOW WE COULD CONTINUE TO THIS DAY TO MAKE THEM IS BEYOND MY COMPRENSION.THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MISPELLED WORDS IN THE PRINT BUT NOTHING THAT DETRACTED FROM THE FACTS. ONE MAJOR BLUNDER WHICH WAS MADE AND WAS NOT INCLUDED AND I HIGHLEY RECCOMMEND READING FOR ANYONE INTRESTED IN THIS SUBJECT. 'IS' ""ONE DAY TOO LONG, SITE 85, HEAVY GREEN"" AUTHORED BY,TIMOTHY N. GREEN."
2,Infamous Infamy,"The book chronicles the mishaps of many different armies, and is chronologically organized.While the book was fairly well-written, there were many mistakes in the facts presented. Anyone with an interest in WWII can find a few, such as the Bismark contradiction by Coffey.I am an avid reader of WWII books, and live on the History Channel. Only 13, I know more than some 8th graders who just studied WWII.I suggest that anyone who is interested in secure facts read other books, and if they chose, this one also."
1,"A fine High School Term Paper, except for Factual Errors","The jacket blurb says this is ""a book no history buff can put down."" I had no problem putting it down. Written in the style of a teen ager trying to get the term paper up to the 500 word minimum, and loaded with factual errors (Coffey sinks the Bismarck both off France and Norway; Iraq invades Kuwait both in August 1991 and August 1990). Surprising that History Channel would get behind such a flawed history."
4,Just another in a long line of Elvis' greatest work that was,"underappreciated. The voice, the ballads, and the feeling that he emits into these recordings...BUY THIS NOW!!-20 something Elvis fan"
5,Very Pleased,"I use this wonderful book on a regular basis for identifing species on catalog lists. I consider this one of my primary palm books. Great for the novice or nurseryman. Easy to read. I would love to see more cultural information in the next edition. However, I would be lost without this book....John TexasGardenCenter.com"
4,REM single,"I like REM, Ihave one of thier best of CDs , but it was missing one of my faverate songs , so I bought this CD , Iwas a bit disappointed that it had a live version of Losing My Religion on it instead of the recard version , but over all a must have for any one who dosen.t want to buy a whole CD or if youare a fan of the band."
5,Great Toy,My nephew was very excited to receive this toy and he really loves it. It's educational and fun.
2,"very buggy , no support","The device sends and receives skype calls just fine but guess what. When you press the end call key on your phone. The skype software closes. Tried to resolve the problem at the company's website and there are no support pages, just more crap for sale. Also when you try to dial a number with your phones keypad, the skype program open up and starts dialing but you still got to walk over to the computer and click dial."
4,Does not pass DTMF or work with Skype 4.1,"Basically a very sound product, but I found two glitches when I installed and started using it. Please read on...As another reviewer noted, it does not pass DTMF tones properly. This makes it less than useful for accessing conference calling services or other applications (like online banking) that require you to enter data via the telephone touch pad. I have not found a workaround for this problem.The other problem was that when I used it with the latest version of Skype (Version 4.1), Skype would exit after each call and had to be manually restarted. Ouch! To overcome this problem, I installed an older version of Skype (Version 4.0), which works just fine.Bottom line, if you just want to make voice calls using Skype, this is a cheap, reliable little box. But it has its limitations."
1,Not worth the money,"I tried to use this product with skype. The product technically ""works,"" however, when you hang up, it closes skype. I tried to trouble shoot this but think it is a design flaw. It really isn't worth it, even though you can use the product, if you have to reopen skype each time you want to make a call. The vendor refunded my money with no hassle."
2,Quite S...L...O...W...,"I am a children's yoga instructor and am always on the lookout for great music to use in my classes. I was very excited about this cd. I popped it into my car cd player and was almost put to sleep after the first song. They are very slow, the music is a little weird...as though they are trying way to hard to ""jazz"" it up. Kids have LOTS of energy and want to move. These songs are too slow. HOWEVER, I have been able to use a few of the songs at the end of my classes during their rest time and before class as the kids are entering the room."
5,It's a Cakepan.,"Its a superman cakepan. It worked, what can I say. Looks exactly like the picture. My kids loved it."
3,"A good thermometer, but falls short of other digitals","The Polder ""Professional Instant-Read Thermometer"" is a great thermometer in many aspects. It reads all tempuratures quickly and accurately with any problem and helps the first time cooker with cooking temps. on the back of the thermometer. Resetting is a cinch and the handy cover sleave protects against burns and steam. The ""necklace"" cord was a really great idea while still allowing you to clip it to your pocket. So what is wrong with this thermometer? Quite simply, small display and the inconvenience of bending down in an uncomfortable position to read temps. Then display is found on the side of the thermo thus prompting you to bend down with your head sideways over a hot pot or roast. Plus with the small display screen I am even closer than I intend to be. Although a reliable device, I would recommend another digital thermometer with bigger display and a display that faces up and away from your food."
3,"Rather good, but .....","This thermometer is working rather well but the ""hold"" feature is not working as indicated in the manual. You have to keep the ""hold"" button down and then the thermometer holds the temperature as measured. Another but: the reaction time is rather slow e.g. in comparison with the Pyrex professionnal thermometer/timer. So don't expect to test the doneness of a thin steak: the steak will be overdone by the time this thermometer gives any reasonable reading."
4,An interesting little book about drilling a RR tunnel.,"This book describes the challenges faced by the people trying to drill a tunnel through a mountain in the Berkshires during the 1800's. This project was one of the first to use TNT, back when it was very unstable. Hundreds of men lost their lives over the course of several years and several attempts to build the Hoosac Tunnel."
5,Reminds me of my favorite Manc,"These earrings are great for 2 reasons:1.they are perfectly round2.they are orangeTherefore, they remind me of one of my most favorite people in the world, Karl Pilkington. Congrats for creating jewelry so like Karl's head."
1,Horrible case,I was very disappointed with this case. The only way this case is good is if you plan on never using your palm and want it to stay in the case. The case is incredibly difficult to open and close. It's a big hassel.
2,Self Promotion,"The author is very biased and introduces theories by other thinkers in strongly negative terms before 'attempting' to 'explain' their views in a coherent way. This book is not so much about Mysticism in my view, but the self promotion of the Dogmatic limited philosophy of Ralph Inge. By 'mind-reading' what he believes some of the great thinkers' motivations were and dismissing them as ludicrous makes this a very hard read, full of negative and depressing words. Open minded books with insights into true Mysticism and Gnostic realities for those seeking to understand and learn are plentiful and this book should be avoided."
5,Lifelike,This is a fun and educational toy. Very lifelike and detailed. I gave my grandaughter two safari incredible creature sea turtles for Christmas along with sea turtle books ordered from Amazon. They go in the bath tub with her for lots of sea adventures.
2,Disapponted,My expectations were not fulfilled. That could be my problem! This is a very average family film. The topic of youth suicide is dealt with in a sensitive manner and does remind all of us that one of the chief reasons that suicide is attempted or completed is the individual thinks that they are totally alone and have no support.The acting left a lot to be desired. I'm think that the youth actors were just beginning in their careers. Some have gone on to other roles. The adults were self-absorbed and unthinking caricatures.
4,good story,this is a good family movie with an excellent theme and is best used if it allows you to talk to your family about the issues it raises after.not exceptionally acted but a very good movie anyway.
4,LOGAN,"NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE MOVIE ""LOGANS RUN"". STORIES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SURPRISED TO SEE HOWARD AND BOO BOO STEWART IN THIS MOVIE. HOWARD IS CURRENTLY A CO-STAR IN A DISNEY PROGRAM NOW, SURROUND MARTIAL ARTS. DO NOT LIKE THE ONE WHO SUPPOSEDLY MANAGES THE MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO. IN MY VIEW, THIS OTHER GUY RUINS THE MOVIE. AS FOR THIS MOVIE, ITS WORTH THE MONEY IN WATCHING AND IN BUYING IT. HOWARD AGAIN SHOWS THAT HE CAN CLEARLY ACT WELL IN ANY MOVIE PLACED ON HIM. HE WILL GO FAR IN LIFE, IM SURE."
1,"Lame, lame, lame","This film starts out badly, and then half way through it gets terrible. The kids probably could have put in a good performance, but the script is awful and the direction is very poor. It was obviously everyone's first attempt at making a feature film. Too bad, because the subject (teen suicide) deserves a good movie. This is not it."
3,Zymurgy,"Perhaps a little far fetched in so far as brotherly relationships, but yes I could imagine a relationship like this but not so intense as the film portrays. I liked the story line and the acting was good. The underlying story about youth suicide, shows quite clearly how sensitive young people are about the way they are portrayed by their peers.Youth suicide is a big issue in most so called civilized countries, unless we get rid of the bigetory, and name calling within our youth culture its not going to get any better unfortunately. Unfortunately this subject matter is swept under the carpet here in Australia, and education authorities are lothe to talk about it, even the news papers do not report suicides. I believe this would be good viewing for upper primary school children, and into high schools..At least the film portrays a happy ending but only just....."
5,Much more than a singer: The King,"Oh yes! Elvis, you're my man.Just take the first twelve, the original list back in 1969, and what you gotta do is bend down your knees while listen this wonderful recreation of all the american musical tradition: country, blues, country sung as a blues and blues sung as country (no one could or can do as he did), soul and almost gospel.Nobody, I say and swear, ever had (neither has) that wonderful ability to take another's song and make it his. From the first roar (""I had to return for a little while!"") to the last chord you'll find yourself weeping, crying, laughing, jumping, and falling absolutely in love with the music, the voice and the man.Here are four bonus tracks, incluiding the best song he ever recorded: Suspicious minds (take a look: the producer was Chips Moman but the whole idea about the arrangements was Elvis').Just enjoy it. He was so much more than critics say."
4,"5 star material, superfluous product?","Arguably Elvis' finest LP, here with contemporaneous bonus material, but all of this stuff was compiled last year on the SUSPICIOUS MINDS set (together with all the rest of the Jan/Feb '69 masters), so this release is kinda superfluous, isn't it?"
5,Christmas Romance,"Back cover reads:ROOM AT THE INNby MARILYN PAPPANO""Home for Christmas."" Those words had never meants as much to Bryce as they did now. For the first time in years, he was back in Angel's Peak, living once again in his childhood home.But the rambling old house was now an inn, managed by Leah, with her beguiling ways and four wonderful children. Instant fatherhood was an appealing prospect, and marriage to Leah... that would be the best Christmas present of all!WOMAN HATERby DIANA PALMEREveryone in the office described the boss's mysterious brother as a real woman hater. So when Nicole White had to travel with her employer to his brother's home in Montana, she was prepared for the worst.What she found in Winthrop Christopher was a man whose distrust of women was as solid as the Montana mountains. Was it possible that at Christmas even mountains could be moved by love?"
5,I love this book!!,This is my go to book when I have some free time. I love to read about the celebrities of past years and find out about how they lived and died. Such interesting people that we have unfortunatly forgotten about. Good book!!
4,GREAT - very detailed!,"I was impressed by the details of how to reach the graves themselves. My dad is a retired funeral director, and he enjoyed getting this as a gift."
3,Where are they Buried?,"I only flipped through the book. I bought it for my Son who loves learning about people that were so famous, and wonders what happened to them. From what I saw, I should have kept the book for me, because a lot of them were still popular in my time."
3,Incorrect information!,"The book is interesting, and therefore I gave it three stars. However, under the section on Frank Lloyd Wright, the author mentions Mamah Borthwick as FLW's first wife. She was not his first wife, and in fact was never his wife (although he had three). She was his mistress. This is a well known, easy to find fact. If the author didn't get this right, I have to question what else in this book is incorrect. Reading material that can't be trusted for accuracy makes me feel uneasy, no matter how interesting it may be."
4,Similar book available,"If you liked this book, as I did, you will probably like ""Here Lies Colorado,"" which contains stories and gravesites about a lot of well-known Colorado people. Particularly interesting if you're from Colorado or know people there, but good reading anyway because a lot of the people in the book are well known nationally -- even internationally."
2,Morbid trivia,"This book is a prime example of what I refer to as ""call of nature reading"". It took me quite some time to read it, as the only time I read it was when I was answering that ""call"". For such a purpose the text is perfectly laid out, organized by individual bio, and then followed by details about that individual's demise and burial status. This book is that simple. There really is nothing else to say about it.I was very irritated by numerous errors found in this text. Too many errors for me to be have faith in the book's research and validity. That is a result of lazy writing and editing. Thus the 2 stars rating.Still, it is a nice journey through Americana... and I read it on the toilet...so no harm, no foul!"
1,"Full of errors, some of which may be caused by an agenda","Once again we have another book about the deaths of the rich and famous, and once again it's full of errors of all kinds.I wonder if writers of this kind of book get a bonus every time they spout some pseudoscience or half-truth or make 2 plus 2 equal 5. (Lactose allergy: sheesh. Are people that stupid?)"
5,where are they buried,Loved it and so did many of my friend who have read it!! It is just full of all kinds of very interesting data. we would name a person and look them up like a game!! and they were usually there!!
4,where are they buried?,"I mainly read non-fiction and am interested in biographies and autobiographies, so naturally when a celebrity dies, I like to know where they are buried as this is the final chapter of their story. I like this book as it tells where to find the gravesite, should you be the type of person who likes to actually see it and also a little bit of inside information. I downloaded this book onto my Kindle from Amazon which is where I get 99% of my books, music and DVDs."
4,Interesting,"May seem morbid, but there are lots of interesting little facts about the people that are written about. Worth the price paid!"
4,A good reference book,Facinating. This isn't the sort of book you need to sit and read cover to cover. You will probably refer back to it for years.There are a few omissions but that is really a minor quibble. (thus the 4 star review.)All the info you want to know without a lot of filler.Recommend.
5,The title says it all.,"A great book for those of us who are fascinated by the ""permanent addresses"" of famous people who have passed on.The book was extensively researched and has many photos of famous grave sites."
5,Confessions of a Boyfriend Stealer,I loved this book so much that I wanted to reply to replies the author put in the book! If you read this book it just makes you want to read more of it but when you get to the end you wish there would be more!
1,Mistake in the product description?,This is not a review.This is a question about the product.Is this the widescreen version in pseudo HD or not?The text above reads that the aspect ratio is 1.33 : 1.Is that a mistake in the product description?
5,Best family videos ever made!!!!,Wonderful family DVD's!!!! We absolutely loved them!!! Would recommend them to anyone!!! A must see!!!
3,Good - Almost Great,"Mom, Dad and baby all love this toy... A few minor details keep it from being 4 or 5 stars... There's no volume control (Not such a big deal, as it is almost too quiet)... It would have been nice to have a continuous play feature for children too young to know to push the yellow button for the next song. On the plus side, it keeps our 3 month old enthralled, and the sound quality is excellent - synthesizer like, rather than the beep-beep-beep quality of other toys."
4,Fine Toy,"The Bach Pipes are a fine Toy, my baby is still too young to learn from it (4 months) but she hit sometimes wild on it and likes the lights. But one negativ is that the sound comes from bottom of the toy and when its standing on a soft underground like the bed, the sound is not to hear."
2,shortlived fun but great for infants,"This game was the apple of my baby's eye for about a week 0r so, and then I put it away. I bring it out every now and again, but nearing 13 months, baby has absolutely no interest in it anymore."
4,Delve into the plotting and complex society of primates.,Very good book for those interested in primate behavior in general. De Waal is an execellent writer and produces books that flow very easily while keeping you interested.
1,Worse Fellowes shredder ever.,"I bought the 970CM model less than a year ago, and when it died I replaced it with another Fellowes shredder. The one I bought was the W11C and less than two days later it does not shred even one page. I did not feed anymore than six normal pages and it jammed after 15 minutes of use. After the jam, it would not shred more than two pages. On the second day it would not shred any. This is a waste of money."
4,Loud but a workhorse,"Buying a cheap (< $100) shredder, I figured it would be dead/broken by now. To my surprise it works as well as Day One."
2,Works OK - But not 11 sheets,"The reviews that say you are limited to about 5-6 sheets are correct. 11 sheets will totally bog down this machine. It is a light duty machine, and needs to cool down after a couple of minutes of shredding.Out of curiousity from the first review, I just tried to shred a CD. No way. It did destroy the CD (and probably the shredder), but it only chmoped down about one inch into the CD before jamming. Barely got it out in the backwards mode."
5,Love it!,"For what I paid, this is a good shredder. Don't expect an industrial grade shredder. However, it's great for light jobs."
1,NOT recommended,"I ordered the Spy Wrist Camera for my 7 year old son for Christmas. After placing the film in the camera and closing it, the film would not advance after many, many attempts. My son was devastated! Also, the camera is bulky, and the wrist band is uncomfortable (according to my son). A much better buy would be an inexpensive real camera for your child, although that might lack the ""spy"" appeal.This is not the first Wild Planet item I've purchased that was defective. We ordered a lie detector wristwatch several months ago, and it was nonfunctional."
2,disappointing!,"This timer did not work well right from the start. After winding it, it would just stop timing. I finally threw it away and now I use one I bought at a garage sale for .50. Same type, but one of the round ones. Maybe I got a faulty timer, but I would not pay this much for one again."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"The back cover reads:""Sarah Hunter was a lady of the night. Not in the salacious sense, but Ethan Travis has no way of knowing her close-held secrets. He saw, instead of an avenging angel, a lost and vulnerable soul who needed his unique talents to rescue her - almost as much as he needed her unconditional love to rescue him!Cloaked in dark and dangerous appeal, Ethan Travis wore his whispered title of ""the Demon of Alsatia"" well. And Sarah Hunter was drawn to him with a mad intensity. But it was futile, she knew, for even a man with a past could never truly desire a woman without a future!""I could not put this book down. I kept wanting to turn the next page a find out what happened. The story is filled with suspens and sensual love scenes. I don't think I'll be loaning this one out - it is a keeper."
5,"Sensual, Fun, Humorous -- Loved it!",I've read hundreds of historical romances and this was one of the better ones. I will leave it to another reviewer to talk more about Sarah and Ethan -- but I loved this book and look forward to many more from Gail Ranstrom. This is a keeper.
1,Saving Sarah by Gail Ranstrom,"This book was such a disappointment, it is very predictable, unfocused on the plot. Just wanders and wanders and wanders.. .I had to go back and continually reread parts to try to understand the plot. ..."
5,Number one in cookware,"Having been cooking for the last 60 years I have purchased and used every type of pot or pan imaginable. Starting with, cheep light weight, aluminum to the most expensive French hammered copper pots and pans. In the end cast iron is number one and Le Creuset is the best of the lot.Frank J. Pignataro"
4,Most interesting read.,"PETER TEIMAN FRANKLIN here,Fascinating introduction, much better than it's competitors.Great read.PETER TEIMAN FRANKLIN,Sweden"
3,Poor Sellers,"Someone simply collected much of Sellers' work and just cut together brief, amusing moments. It's very fast-paced and becomes relentless. That style just isn't Sellers.However, it's still Sellers, so I can't complain too much, it's just that I think Peter Sellers was an absolute genius and should be celebrated properly. In a fantasy world, I think it would be interesting to interview Michael Palin, Woody Allen, etc. and ask them what they're favorite Sellers moments were, and then roll the footage, rather than hitting you over the head with clip after clip.I'm sure this was done on the smallest of budgets: The sound is horrific, the packaging is poorly printed and the tape seems bottom-shelf. A bit of a disappointment."
5,Another servant of the truth,"I read this boo and found it to be a good effort at laying out all the possibilities. Like I try to show in my novels, the labels applied to factions are just that. Liberals and Conservatives are just words the powermongers use to get the masses to turn off their brains. Brother Collins shines a light on both of these factions.I eagerly look forward to the day works like this are unnecessary, but I don't think it will be anytime soon."
5,Read about it in NEXUS Magazine. GREAT BOOK!,"I first discovered this book through an article over it in Nexus Magazine. Then, I got a copy and read it cover to cover! Paul Collins presents information of such importance that no concerned, freedom-loving American should ignore! ...God bless America! Long live liberty!"
1,I wasted my money,"As I mentioned in the title of this review, buying this book was a waste of money. Fortunately, it was not a waste of time, because I read the book in about 45 minutes.-This thing is a ""book"" for the only reason that it has a cover, and was printed by an irresponsible publishing house. It is the product of a weekend of sloppy research on the Internet. The whole book is just a copy of pages and pages of articles found in the web, placed together without any analysis or sense. It is actually an 85 page pamphlet inflated to 174 pages by the trick of printing the text at double space.-What a waste of paper."
2,$135.00 Quality??,"I have had quality issues with the ceramic coating starts to bubble and flake off. Org. purchased one 11"" Sauté pan 6 yrs. ago 1 1/2 yrs. the store where I purchased stated that they had these issues due to their reuse of scrap material in the production process. They replaced the pan for me without having to go through Scanpan. 2 yrs. later it happened again; this time the store would not replace stating that they no longer carry the brand... I did get the product replaced through Scanpan after getting a RA and mailing back to them. 2 yrs. later I have the same problem AGAIN; I just got off the phone to get a RA emailed to me.A drawback of this pan is having to get it replaced every 2 years. Positives are it's a quality pan and the return process isn't the worst I've had to deal with. After this one maybe I'll give up and try All-Clad."
3,Obsolete telephone info,Time has passed this telephone manual by. There has to be some more current manual out there. There is perhaps one useful chapter.
4,Powerful and Good,"I like this. It is powerful with somewhat of a haunting quality to it. I have to say though about two songs of this is enough at one time. They are all very similar to my ears. I like this music and artist but I will only be listening to a couple songs at a time because I just don't see much difference between the songs, and the fact that the music is so powerful makes it difficult for me to take in large doses."
5,gula gula,"It is amazing how Joik tradition has evolved. The traditional style of no real beginning or ending of their particular style and the fact that Joik is different every time a ""song"" is ""sung"" brings you back to a time of a REAL beginning, of oral tradition and everyday life as it is. These days are sad because there is no real togetherness like the Sami people had . I envy them for their hard livelyhood and REAL family life!"
5,Dora DVD's,"Great DVD my grand daughter loves all things ""Dora""and this DVD was no exception she loved it."
1,Duplicate copy of the original,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my little niece, who loves Dora. Imagine my surprise as she put the movie in to the DVD player and nothing happened. Her response to me was TE TE why my movie is not playing? I was just as disappointed as she was to discover on Christmas day that my gift to her was a poor purchase choice."
5,Happy Grand-Daughter,My grand daughter (age 3-1/2) loves this DVD. She may wear it out before she turns 4.
1,Slanted view point,"The book is very negative and slanted. It fails to take into account the numerous women who lived through the chnages in religious life and are living healthy, vibrant and God centered lives of prayer and ministry."
1,"If I wanted the Vatican""s opinion on the subject, guess whom I might ask??",This one was so bad that I took a loss in order to be able to return it and get it out of my house.
5,My 2 year old loves it,"My son is only 2 years old but he loves this book. We received it yesterday and it's been read multiple times. He has told me both nights that he is going to tell the moon his secrets. The story is very sweet and helps to remind young ones that even though someone goes away they will come back. At this age, it's very important to reinforce that idea."
5,a wonderful book!,"This is an excellent book, it teaches children a little about the moon and a lot about kindness and friendship. The pictures are lovely, my 2 girls (ages 5 &6) really love Cosmo's Moon."
1,Horrible,"I basically own this album, seeing as the people next to me in my dorm play it all day, every day.These ""songs"" are horrible. I mean, honestly, how hard is it to come up with something original for a change? Everyone sings about getting high, these guys just take to a whole new level of utter garbage.If I have to hear ""rest of my life"" one more time, I will commit myself to a ward."
1,What happened,"I used to be a die hard KMK fan, but I think I'm just gonna try to pretend they stopped making music after high society. All of these people saying that the KMK have evolved are just trying sound like a long time fan. But, they're fakin the funk cause no long time KMK fan would be able to respect the kings after this album. It was fun while it lasted...face it."
3,Stoned Singers,"I like the first KMK album but this is disappointing primarily because the rapping has evolved into singing and some songs are lame. At times there are flashes of stoned-cold rapping but it isn't worth listening to the entire album.Secondly, rapping has changed so much since this was produced during 2001 that some tracks are far from the edge. Some KMK fans may enjoy as will those who like singing rappers. But this is not rockin' rappin'.I am selling my copy because it will never make my heavy play rotation list."
4,Kottonmouth boys back at it!!,"I've been a long time fan of the King's. Royal Highness is there greatest work in my opinion. But the new ""Rollin' Stoned"" comes real close to the perfection of that previous album. Rumor has it if they do not reach a certain number of sales of this album the will be dropped from the label. It would be a shame for a group as great as the Kottonmouth Kings to be tossed to the wayside. So support the bong smokin' alcholics. Buythis cd you won't be disapointed. Also see them live. They are on tour now and put on one hell of a show. You might even catch a glimps of the ""Taxman"" from Corporate Avenger on stage with them."
5,KICK A** SH**,THIS IS AN AMAZING CD ALL OF KMK'S CD'S ARE AMAZING IV BEEN WITH THR KROWN SINCE I WAS 9 AND TO SUBUBAN TERROR IF YOU EVER WERE A TRUE KMK FAN OR DOWN WITH THE KROWN YOU WOULD KNO ROYAL HIGHNESS WAS THEIR 2ND CD AND STONERS REAKIN HAVOC IS THERE 1ST
4,Best movie from Andy Warhol.,"This DVD is of VHS quality but still the same good movie starring Carroll Baker. If you want a great off beat funny movie, this is the classic of all funny movies."
3,three to not disturb the rating,"I have not seen this movie but I just wish to point out that this is most likely not the Andy Warhol film ""Bad"" starring the late Cyrinda Fox, wife of David Johansen and Steven Tyler as that ""Bad"" was made in 1977. Unless, of course it was re-released, which I find doubtful."
1,"I'm a rockabilly gal, and this just doesn't click with me","I love Brian Setzer's music from The Stray cats up to his recent Christmas cd, but this is the only cd he's ever done that I can't can't stand, no matter how much I want to like it, it just makes no sense musically or in any way what so ever. Why would Brian add hip hop and techno and rap to what could have been a timeless rockabilly swing cd, go figiure, skip this one, and get his Christmas cd, or the Dirty boogie... I find that a record is really bad, when I can't even take a sip of my martini, and not be able to enjoy it's refreshingly cool taste... This is not one you'll be hearing at one of my famous west Covina coocktail parties anytime soon..."
1,"Frantic lounge music, with touches of rap & techno","This is wild lounge music, with Techno, hip hop and rap. This cd was done in bad taste, and though some swing dancers might enjoy it for the fast tempos, it just is a bad follow up to the Dirty Boogie, sorry Setzer I hate giving you 1 star, but you shouldn't have added rap and techno to your fun brand of rockabilly lounge music."
5,AWESOME HIGH ENERGY,"Never heard of Brian Setzer, then a friend at work described his style ""Big Band meets 50's Rock-n-Roll"". Bought it on Amazon and played it nonstop for weeks. On a short road trip I played 'Pennselvania 6-5000' for a friend. He wouldn't let me change the disc until we listened to the whole thing. Wound up buying several copies for friends.High Energy, Great arrangements. This album is mostly Big Band era stuff with an electric lead guitar."
3,"Decent buy, lackluster performance","Being a big jazz and swing buff, as well as owning the previous three albums, I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, like the Dirty Boogie, I thought it didn't live up to the previous two. I had problems with Pennsylvania 6-5000 and Gettin' In the Mood, though my complaint is not the addition of lyrics (it's been done before on In the Mood), but rather the rap. In my opinion rap has no business in swing, it doesn't blend well. My second complaint about this album is that. like the Dirty Boogie, there isn't a consistent sound ""theme"". The coherency between the tracks, just isn't there like it was on ""Brian Setzer Orchestra"" and ""Guitar Slinger"". BSO had a consistent crooner/old-style big band theme, and Guitar Slinger took rockabilly to perfection for me. Vavoom! needed more work. In my opinion it has the start for 3 or 4 other albums, but is not coherent in itself."
1,Glenn Miller is rolling in his grave...,"If Elvis had recoded Pennsylvannia 6-5000 in the late 50's, it would have sounded someting like Setzer's horrible version. Glenn Miller is surely rolling in his grave every time it's played. Brian Setzer shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a recording studio, his music is offensive to people who listen to swing music, he mocks swing and jazz, anyone who had the least respect for swing wouldn't mock Glenn Miller that way. It sounds as though Setzer went out of his way to make Pennsylvannia 6-5000 sound as cheezy as he could make it. Setzer is a talentlass goof off. If you want some real swing try the following artists. Benny Goodman, Don Redman, Mora's Modern Rhythmists, Jelly Roll morton, King Oliver, Louis Armstrong. But please if you have any respect at all for swing, don't buy this clown Stzer's joke of a CD, an insult to swing."
1,Not his brightest moment,"Brian Setzer sounded so great on his previous cd to this one ""The Dirty Boogie"" how could he have gone so downhill. The problem here actually isn't in Setzer's steller performances, it's in the lame song selection and the production, which is just overproduced majorly. Take the rap solos out, and teh corny, beat music out, and dumb filler songs liek Americano(which wasn't even cute when Sophia Lauren sang it). This is an alla round disaster, though Setzer's voice is amazing and his solos are flawless, too bad..."
1,"I love Brian setzer's Orch., but...","Setzer and his band are sizzlin' hot, and he is my favorite swing band leader, however no matter how many times I try to listen to this cd, I just can't bring myself to like it. It is just too darn hokey, cheezy, commercial, and corny. In the Mood is full of energy, and could have been great without the ""DJ MIX"" club beat intro, and I find the rapping offensive racially. It sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere, and mocking the race. Setzer's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great, and band is smokin. The sonsg americano sucks, and the production value in nill, zero, nana, it's WAY overproduced. Buy hsi new live 2 cd set instead..."
4,BSO Gets a Little Adventurous,"What can I say? This album may not get Brian Setzer any new fans, but it will certainly please those who already enjoy him.I do think that this is Brian's most ""adventurous"" album since forming the BSO. Yes, the classic ""BSO Sound"" is there (""Jumpin' East of Java"", ""If You Can't Rock Me"", ""Footloose Doll""), but so is a little surf/car music (""Drive Like Lightning [Crash Like Thunder]"", ""'49 Mercury Blues"") and some really cool do-wop (""That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes"", ""Gloria"").But most impressive (and possibly offensive to ""purists"") is Brian's decision to update several classics (""Pennsylvania 6-5000"", ""Gettin in the Mood"", ""Americano"") with techno and hip-hop flavoring.Round it out with a true-to-the original version of ""Mack the Knife"" (continuing Brian's habit of covering a Bobby Darin song on each of the BSO albums) and a guitar-focused version of the Duke Ellington classic ""Caravan"", and you've got a teriffic, if somewhat not-quite-as-mainstream, BSO effort."
1,Shame shame shame,"Shame on Brian Setzer for being a ""Sell out"", by taking what could have been a classic rockabilly big band cd, and turning it into ""campy"" trash. Setzer's producers forced him into adding tacky raps, and techno on this would be classic, skip this, and get Vavoom, and the Christmas cd, also check out Cari Lee, and Royal Crown Review for non sell out neo swing. This is just an emberessment, even to rockabilly fans(and I'm not a swing ""purist"", what does taht even mean???). Skip this and do yourself a favor, get any Setzer release but this one."
1,A true one star disc...,"Oh boy, I can't believe people are buying this, after just listening to the samples, what Setzer has done to ""Pennsylvannia 6-5000"" and ""In The Mood"" it's a swing dancers worst nightmare come true. He recorded in the mood with a dated 1950's sounding white choir that couldn't swing, even if you hung them with a rope. wITH sETZER'S ANNOYING electric guitar playing and cheezy lounge hillbilly singing, this CD is truly a one star disc."
5,Vavoom!,Great CD. Kids are dancing to 2 songs on it in the dance recital this year. We like all the songs on the CD.
4,Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie,"Some songs are really great (""Mack the Knife"", ""Caravan"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie""). My favourite here is ""The Footloose Doll""!Album is produced by Glen Ballard (?) and Peter Collins! Two pop producers and that's why some songs are overproduced ""Pennsylvania 6-5000"", ""Gettin' in the Mood"", ""That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes"" (featuring 14 Karat Soul) & ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" (14 Karat Soul are here again on backings. And yes this is Queen's hit)."
2,"""...a bit of a disappointment""","""...a bit of a disappointment."" - Stephen Thomas Erlewine---review from the online All Music Guide"
1,too expensive...,"Wow save your money, this is not worth it, this is really bad rockabilly because there is rap, hip hop and even techno in the mix, don't put your mind and body thru this, you deserve better try setzer's Dirty Boogie cd instead."
4,No DIRTY BOOGIE.,"I was disappointed in this CD. I love Brian & Company, and have enjoyed him in concert. He is an amazing performer and a truly gifted musician.All that said, on this CD they all seemed tired. Vocals are scratchy and the tempos seemed to be in a hurry to get nowhere. GREAT updates to some classics, especially AMERICANO & MACK THE KNIFE... I just missed the playfulness of the last CD--- THE DIRTY BOOGIE.Well worth a listen and to the BSO collection, just lacking some freshness and for the lack of a better word, humor."
4,The Nay Sayers are WRONG!,"Setzer has ROCKED since the Stray Cats and the new BSO album is no different. Brian and crew update the rockabilly and swing sound and it's great! Those who say the Setzer Orchestra is worthless have no appreciation of adaptation of musical styles into a VERY enjoyable SWWWWIIIIINNNGGGGIN' Setzer style. The originals are no less great, but the remakes are fun, and the originals are great! If only more CD's were as much fun!"
1,Setzer's energy is high but a bad follow up to Dirty Boogie,"This cd is an insult to swing dancers and paopel who like swing msuic, retro or neo. Brian Seter's Dirty Boogie Cd is a 4 1/2 star disc, maybe even a 5, however this cd, is just insluting comne on a rap on a Glenn Miller song??? Setzer was trying oo hard for commercial success, skip this, if you already have Dirty Boogie get his Christmas cd instead. Setzer can get away with dong ""Elvis"" sounding material, but he isn't Miller worthy. As always Setzer's guitar and vocals are wonderful thoughout, and the band is just a prop behind him, ehich is tight, but not allowed to stretch out at all(no solos, other than Setzer's guitar). Too bad he couldn't have skipped the Glann Miller rap tunes and stuck to his originals, rockabilly Elvis swing, or even Louis Jordan, Louis Prima or Louis Armstrong. I hope he'll continue recording, and I think he and his band are great, but skip this one."
1,The Same TUNE!,no matter what cover Brian Setzer does or new song he comes up with it all sounds the same.this disc is no different.while the Stray Cats was cool back in the early 80's his take on Swing is way better than the other Groups but it like the others falls way short on Groove&Swinging.this Disc doesn't Speak Cab Calloway to me.it sounds more like Johnny Rivers or Ricky Nelson doing a Take on Bill HAley than any real Swing.
4,Lives Up to Its Predecessors,"Having seen Brian on tour weeks prior to this release, it sounds just as fresh on CD. Pennsylvania 6-5000 is a jumping track, similar to previous songs like Dirty Boogie and Jump Jive An Wail. Mack the Knife is an ambitious cover. Americano is fun at its best, and Gloria also stands out. Obviously, this cat still has a few lives left!"
5,Awesome BSO album,"I do agree with the opinion of one of the reviewers here: Setzer gets better and better with time. This is a *GREAT* album! It is impossible to stay still while listening to the songs in ""Vavoom"". From the updated rendition of ""Gettin' in the Mood"" to the nice opening vocals in ""That's the kind of sugar papa likes"" and the cool 'bepoping' chords from ""Jukebox"", a fine modern swing CD by the leading genre act: Brian Setzer's Orchestra."
4,Vavoom smokes.,"I got this cd without hearing any of the tracks and having not yet seen the music video yet. I have played the cd 10 or 12 times since I picked it up. My favorite tracks are "" Americano"", ""Caravan"",""Pennsylvania 6-5000"" ""Mack the Knife"" and of course ""Gettin'In The Mood"". Americano and Gettin' In the Mood are very up-beat and could cause you to start dancing. If you like swing or music of this type or a fan of Brian Setzer (The Dirty Boogie CD is very cool to listen to also)"
2,Not too shabby!,"I don't liek this as well as dirty Boogie, becasue of the rapping and techno, bit it's not too shabby if you can overlook it's many flaws, like a stupid song called ""Ride Like Thunder"" and a lame rendition of ""Americano"" from the cary Grant Sophia Loren movie ""Houseboat"", this isn't a 3 star cd because of the hip hop and techno, it doesn't mix well with swing. It's liek adding tobasco cauce to your martini. Buy Dirty Boogie and if ya can't get enough and are a diehard fan, go ahaed and blow $18.00, it's not really worth it, but if ya liek Setzer you can forgive him for his dumb mistakes that ruin this cd fro mbeing a classic."
2,Don't Get Me Wrong...,"But this book sucked. I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the author. I started with 2nd Assassin, loved it, then it was Gathering of Saints, love it, then Wisdom of the Bones, and I loved it, but this early work by Hyde just didn't cut the mustard with me. I found it slow, and awkward, and it felt as though it was written by a novice. I didn't finish, barely got half way, which is pretty rare for me. I've got to really dislike a book to not finish. If I had read this book 1st I wouldn't have read any of his work since this one. Glad I didn't start here."
4,Excellent for getting behind radiators...,"I used this roller to get behind my radiators and it worked pretty well. It was fairly smooth in the beginning, but got harder to work with as the day went on. It was extremely easy to clean, and fairly comfortable to hold, but I wasn't impressed with the roller cover options for this product."
3,Bar Set,"The Stain-less Bar Set is a bit pricy, but is a nice compliment to a small bar. The items included are all essential and easy to clean. My average rating reflects that the product delivers and is adequate, but should be given the price."
4,Riot - releases another world class production,"After another excellent release I continue to wonder the reason Riot does not receive more attention from the world of hard rock. Mark Reale's musicianship has been, and continues to be, on par with the most respected guitarists of the genre. Mark's compositions on ""Through the Storm"" are no exception; each song is an amalgam of expert timing, arrangement, and harmony, and if you are a fan of rock songs with soloing guitar this album will certainly delight. My picks are tracks 1,2,4,7, and the tribute instramental to George Harrison."
4,Strong release,"This is similar to other latter-day Riot albums, a good album of metal with a mature attitude, superior musicianship, and interesting songwriting. The composing is much more complex and detailed than simple riff-based metal, although not in a showoffy kind of way. As is typical with Riot, it takes time for the songs to sink in. It's lacking in true standout material, but is very consistent. The Beatles cover is nice, while the UFO cover is a nice gesture, but ill-advised. The comparison to Rainbow by the one reviewer is quite unfair: this is much harder than latter-day Rainbow. Mike DiMeo might be similar to Joe Lynn Turner in vocal quality, but doesn't have his deal-killing soullessness. It actually sounds eerily similar to Michael Schenker's ""Written in the Sand"" album, especially vocally. Possibly not the best introduction to the band, but by no means a disappointment."
5,LOVE IT!,I recently rediscovered this in my CD collection and have been listening to some portion of it on a daily basis for almost a month now. I especially love the simplified and slower version of New Gold Dream that the set concludes with. It is a great concert album.
4,Caution!,"The SM double album ""Live In the City of Light"" is a great feast for those persons who were really into ""New Gold Dream"", ""Sparkle In the Rain"", and especially the then recent ""Once Upon A Time"" releases. If you're a fan of much of their first three releases then there might not be much here that you like. Otherwise, these live discs present a stadium friendly SM with big, expansive, reverberating sounds and Jim Kerr's soaring, hopeful vocals and is a tasty but not necessary treat.But the caution above is for anyone who might be buying from a third party as I did. Whomever I bought this from thought that the CD (volume 2 in this case) was the total package, or they didn't care. Either way I only got half of what I ordered. With this particular product it might just be best for the buyer to purchase from Amazon themselves. I had owned this long ago on cassette when it first came out, now I own half of the concert on CD. 4 stars for the CD and 1 star for the service. Buyer be warned."
5,Heavenly Heavenly,Better than the competition. I bought one for me and have since purchased three more for appreciative friends. Very classy.
4,What a wonderful book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was so interesting to hear the stories behind all the Christmas songs. The only reason I rated it a four is that not all the song lyrics are included. Even when it is a song I know by heart, I liked reading through the words, especially songs that have several verses that we don't always sing. Very sweet, easy to read, and interesting."
2,Add it to your research - but don't use it as a sole source.,"Another reviewer points out the this author seems to weave fairy tales into his narrative. That's exactly the problem. There is often a core of fact in what he's describing - but he weaves about half a page of fact into a fanciful two and half pages which he crams with spiritual extrapolation. He adds a subtext to almost every story that is his own agenda...putting thoughts into the composers head and words into their mouth which are obviously fabricated. It's frustrating - because if he had gone with ""Just the facts, Maam"" it would have been one of the most useful books out there on the subject. Instead, when i'm researching a carol, I have to cross check it with several other sources to make sure he hasn't completely invented part of a story."
3,Great read - but too small,The book and information was wonderful. A very nice read. However - stick to the original size. This miniature edition is a little TOO miniature... only about 1 inch square.
5,Wonderful!,I love this book. It's so informative and interesting. These already profound songs - that have endured for so many years - become even more so once you learn the stories behind them. HIGHLY recommended!
4,Great resource -- and good reading!,"Ace Collins takes a good number of our favorite carols and Christmas songs and gives you ""the rest of the story."" For example -- did you know that Gene Autry really didn't want to sing about a Reindeer with a red nose? Or that Mel Torme wrote ""The Christmas Song"" in the middle of a California heat wave? These are only tidbids -- you'll never hear ""I Wonder as I Wander"" without tearing up after you hear this song's provenance. Or take ""O Holy Night"" for granted once you learn how it was actually reviled by the church for . . . no, I won't tell you more. Buy the book. Pick up half a dozen of these and give them as gifts next holiday season -- your friends & family will thank you!"
3,Good Reading,Good book to read during Christmas. I found it informative and interesting. For some reason I just couldn't get into it very deeply.
4,Anatomy of a Murder not widescreen .,The only reason I got this set was to upgrade to the widescreen version of Anatomy of a Murder. So much for that idea. I already owned all three films. I sold my originals and ended up dead even as far as the cost is concerned. Still don't have a widesceen version of Anatomy of a Murder. The films are still excellent.
2,Confusing!,"This book is confusing to me. It kept going to the past then the future, and on, and on, and on. It started out okay. But I really didn't get the ending. This is short because I really don't have nothing to actually say about it. I don't really recommend this book to anyone."
3,A thriller novel dealing with mysteries from the past,The scenes begin at a beach during the times when bikinis were just about popping up in the fashion world. It so happens that some young teens are enjoying their Spring Break and slowly some of them end up dying one by one. No one knows who exactly is the killer. Could it be one of the group? A stranger? See how good you are at theses thriller- mystery books and solve the puzzle.
3,Average,"This started out as a brilliant book, until the end. It was very realistit until people started going back in time. I loved the idea, but it gets to silly."
5,THIS BOOK DESERVES 1OO STARS!,"Like I said before. This book deserves more than 5 stars. I read it like five times in a row and I still plan on reding it again. That is how good and utterly creepy it is. When I first began to read this book, I was wondering why Stine kept on switching from time to time. But then at the ending I realize why. Then I also wondered why it was called beach house but the ending also explaines that too. There is really one killer but in a way, there's really three. I was so shocked when i read the ending. This is the BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST book that Stine has ever wrote. It has suspence, romance, horror and a totally heart sanking conclusion. Shoppers who are reading my review, you will not regret buying this book. It is just wonderful. I RECCOMEND! BUY THIS BOOK! IT IS REALLY GOOD!"
3,O.K. But not that great!,"R.L. Stine, switches about every 30 pages back and forth from two time periods. This Summer and Summer of 1956.In 1956 maria, Amy, Ronnie, and Sturat played a mean joke on a guy named Buddy. He doesn't like it.In fact he hates it so much he could kill...In this summer Ashly has a crush on Brad, but she doesn't know he might be a killer...I hated this summmer but I sort of liked 1956. So I guss that evens it out to 3 stars.--Scottie Schaeffer age ten"
5,NICE LITTLE THRILLER 4 THOSE SUMMER ROAD TRIPS....,This book proved to be a great read for my 3 hour trip to VA Beach. Interesting & thrilling storyline for those who like R. L Stine teen thrillers... even if you're not a teen. Thumbs up!
1,Mr. Cynical takes a stab,"I think i read this book about five years ago and the only thing i can remember about it is that someone called Buddy shows off his arse accidentally when he loses his swim-trunks. Grow out of R.L. Stine, people! There's a whole world of, um, better stuff out there. Like sleep. And hayfever tablets."
1,Amazing.. UNTIL the horrible ending.,"The book had me zooming through the chapters non stop. I stayed up late wanting to know what would happen next, who was going to die, and who the killer was. Sadly, the ending ruined the whole book for me. It went from murder mystery to sci fy. The book took a 180 and went down hill. I was very disappointed with the outcome. The ending just ruined the whole book. I was upset that I wasted my time to get that stupid ""Back to the Future"" ending. Major disappointment. Just plain stupid.."
4,Beach House,"I think that The Beach House by RL Stine is an excellent murder mystery book. It kept me on edge with book in hand, with a surprise at every turn of a page. You can really think about what's going on. In the parts of the book when it is set in the fifties, I read about the ""modern"" furniture of their day, which would seem really old fashioned to people today. One example of that would be when Lucy and Kip go into the beach house and see the fifties furniture and laugh about how old it is. This made me laugh too, and think about how times and styles have changed over the years. Boys and girls in middle school would deeply enjoy reading it, for the suspense keeps you hooked until the end."
3,Pick up Shadowgate or Deja Vu first,"If you would like to know what you're getting into, check out the reviews for Shadowgate and Deja Vu, two other games made by the same company and in the same style. If this style of game appeals to you, just know that while still an alright game, Uninvited is simply not the equal of either of the other two."
4,Perfect Kit for my Jeep,"I was surprised by the quality of the tune-up kit. It was very nice and everything went in very easily. I am not a mechanic by any means, and I was able to install the tune-up get in about 30 min.Pros:* One box, everything you need.* Parts are good Quality for the Price* Everything Fits perfectly* Nice Spark PlugsCons:*No instructions so be prepared to Google locations of your Fuel Filter etc.*Oil Filter Isn't anything great, but gets the job done.I install this on a 91' Jeep Wrangler. Everything fit to perfection, and it was a very simple install. Would buy again!"
5,EXCELLANT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT,"A WELL WRITTEN NOVEL. IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION 'WHAT IS HELL REALLY LIKE?' VERY INTERNAL, IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW THE CHARACTERS. CRYING IS UNAVOIDABLE AT THE END."
5,this is a must read,this book will keep you looking for more as this ranger team goes into one situation after another in Vietnam
4,Good Choice Unless Aiming For >90%,"This was the most useful test prep aid I had. Most importantly, I would say that if you are considering taking a Kaplan GRE course, don't do it. You're better off just buying this book (and/or the individual verbal/math books). It covers the same strategies that the class does at a fraction of the cost. The only negative remark I have about this book is that if you are shooting for scores in the 9oth or 95th percentile (e.g. a combined verbal/math score of 1400 or above) then this is not the book for you. Frankly though, I haven't seen any books that accomodate for this sort of goal."
1,Lazy authors,"I have Kaplan GRE 2002 with CD-ROM, and the tests in this book are *exactly the same*, including section and full-length ones. Flash cards, games, *everything* is the same. In *two* years, they didn't lift their finger to update the book. Of course, analytical section is out, and ""analytical writing"" is in, but it's the first year for this new section and I didn't expect any GRE book to have good coverage of this subject, so this one predictably didn't."
3,"Excellent software, but the textbooks is a bit useless","I was really impressed by the software (3 cat tests, 1 diagnostic test, many excercises, advices and so on).So, if you want a sofware for your training, which is not a bad idea since the GRE is computer based, go for it.However, the textbok is not good: you can read it in no time because there is not much to read; the math review is rather brief and simple; and if you need a good verbal training, you should buy Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook...Therefore, if you need a textbook (not software preparation kit), you should go with Barron's."
2,Warning: CD-ROM does NOT work for Macs,"Kaplan's test strategies are decent, and since the GRE is computer-based test, I bought this book primarily because it comes with a CD-ROM of practice tests. As an educator, I know that it's crucial to practice under test conditions. I thought this book was the answer, except that the disc is for Windows only! This is the 2007 edition, and I'm very dissatisfied with the useless coaster this book comes with--it would have been halfway decent of Kaplan to include a disclaimer somewhere on the cover or in the Amazon description informing the buyer that they chose to ignore a significant (and ever-increaasing) segment of the population, known as Mac users.I also bought the 2006 edition of Barron's GRE test prep book, and while they do have a disc that works for both PC and Mac, it only works for Mac OS 8 (!). Apparently, the people making these study guides think that Mac users are not applying to grad school."
3,Go with the GRE Verbal and Quantitative books instead,"I bought this book, along with the Verbal and Quantitative specific books by Kaplan. The bottom line is, don't buy this book if you plan to buy the other two. If you don't plan to do an in-dept study or if the test is coming up soon, then go with this book. Just remember that there is nothing in this book that is not explained in greater detail in the Verbal and Quantitative books.By the way, I got scores of 590 verbal and 760 quantitative by using the other two books. I barely touched this one and only studied for about 12 hours per week for 4 weeks. I spent most of my time memorizing the 2000 most common GRE words listed in the Verbal book (there are only about 200 words in the general GRE book)."
1,Bad Choice,Do not buy this book. Go for the Barron's book. It has a huge 3500 word list and detailed mathematics review section. Plus 5 full length tests. The kaplan book has only ONE test. Use the ETS software (2 tests) and Sheppard GRE/SAT word games (do a google search). Stay away from this book. Just not worth it!
3,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE,"I just recieved Kaplan's GRE book, and while the book itself seems to be very helpful, the CD is only for Windows users - in other words it doesn't work for anybody who owns a Macintosh computer. ... I want to let future Mac users who are considering this book know about this, as it might influence their decision to buy the book and CD."
4,Superb little book on an exciting & special building,"Excellent little book on the ""Fallingwater"" house by famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed in 1935 ( He also designed Guggenheim Museum ). This little book ( measures 5 X 7 inches )contains 90 pages of which the first 15 pages are text, from page 17 to 82 there're Black&White photographs, the last 8 pages are drawings and plans of the house accompanied by explanations to the images. Photos are by Ezra Stoller and ""Fallingwater"" ( Pennsylvania - USA ) is undoubtfully the most photogenic private house ever built! All photos are superb, especially the ones showing the waterfall running underneath this superb house!Drawings and plans are made by floor and give a good idea of the interior dining room, kitchen and terraces!"
5,"Nice pan, nice size","I have had ScanPan for years and enjoy using it. When I saw this pan, I thought the size was perfect for cooking smaller ammounts. I was correct. It is also dishwasher safe, a real plus."
2,Scratched on First Use,"The first thing I cooked in this pan was a grilled cheese. I used a silicone spatula to turn it, and a sponge to wash it afterwards. As I was hanging it on the hook where I would store it, the light caught the bottom of the skillet and I noticed two scratch marks in the surface. I used it again a couple of days ago to scramble eggs. When I was done, I saw more scratches on the bottom. I would not purchase this pan again, nor any pan in this line. I have used only silicone spatulas. The reason I'm not giving it one star is because the food didn't stick. I have no expectation of this skillet lasting long, because it makes me wonder--if there are marks indicating the surface has been scratched, where did that material go? Into my food? Very disappointed in this product and will not purchase another."
2,scan pan,This is not what we wanted and I am going to return it.I will try to find another item to purchase.
3,It Does Make It Shine...,"I used my brother-in-law's paste on my black Lexus GX. First the good:*It did make my car shine like no other wax so far.*It was very easy to apply and remove.Now the not so good:*It left smear marks that were difficult to remove.*It left a ton of wax dust in the crevices of the car.If I were to buy this product, I'd use the liquid version in the hopes that I can at least eliminate the dust part. I'm also interested to see what kind of staying power it has."
3,Tiny Tarts,"I received the item quickly, but it is candy and the yellow ones tasted different than they were supposed to."
2,Spinning - Treason,"I ordered this CD thinking it was for ""spinning"" as in ""exercise"" however, as it turned out, it was the title of an album by the rock band ""Treason"", whom I had never heard of. You can therefore imagine my dismay when I started listening to it. The music is not entirely bad but it's definitely NOT a ""spinning"" CD!"
3,Easy listening,"This CD was kind of ""easy listening."" It would be fine to fall asleep to, but not so great for driving."
3,Too general and focused on racing for the tour reader,"I'm on pg 94 and I'm finding this book too general and focused on the long distance racer. The equipment suggestions are summaries, not descriptions or principles. The language level is annoyingly low. I highly recommend Adventure Cycle Touring instead."
5,Great resource for an overlooked genre,"The bulk of the books on cycling out there are about racing, which is cool but not especially helpful for the mere mortals (like myself) who just want to improve distance. I bought this in preparation for the Seattle to Portland ride, and it's more than paid for itself in the benefits I've gotten from it.The book is comprehensive in its coverage, and written specifically for the rider who is training to complete a century ride. It includes sections on nutrition, bike fit, training schedules, equipment, etc., all of which is relevant to the working cyclist. The advice it gave about neck soreness helped me get over a debilitating tendency I have to tense my shoulders, leaving my neck so tired after 40 miles that I can't lift my head. Now I'm riding >50 miles with no problems.Includes sample training schedules for single and double centuries. Highly recommended."
3,Good introduction,This is a good book for anybody looking for an introduction to long-distance cycling.If you have already done a few centuries or multi day rides there are only few new things you will learn.Still interesting and covers all the essentials.
3,ok book,good book but not what i expected. The are alot more things could have been add to make it more useful.
5,Thorough Lessons to Learn the Easy Way,"This book pretty much covers it all, from how to adjust your saddle to what to do about hallucinations on your ultra long-distance ride. Although I have a fair amount of experience training for centuries, I learned a lot and have managed to diminish unnecessary suffering. There are training charts and heart-rate guides for the obsessive-compulsives, and a lot of common sense for the rest of us who just like to ride. It's well written and sound. Now, turn off the computer and go ride!"
2,Kind of Lame,I did not get much out of this book. It looks like a lot of ideas were copied from long distance running data. Important issues like clipless pedals were skimmed over. Also I would like to have seen a chapter on common breakdowns and how to avoid them. Training and nutrition were discussed to death.....
3,Good but not systematic,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. The title implies that the authors present a systematic way of building skill and endurance for long distance cycling. Instead, it is more of a collection of tips. The content is still worthwhile."
4,Totally unbelievable!,"It is trully amazing what a ""modern day christ""-Joao-is doing. The man is walking on the border of fiction and fairy tale. I just wish I could see these things with my own eyes-would I believe it then? I don't know. Why nobody mention his name on the news, media...? Just wondering"
5,The Miracle Man,This book changed my life. I am making arrangements to go to Brazil and see John of God.
4,Joao De Deus - A True Healer,"Although Mr. Pellegrino-Estrich's text sensationalizes the healings of Joao De Deus, the subject of which he writes is true and fascinating reading. The information most pertinent is the deep spiritual and emotional work that is necessary to facilitate our own healing abilities. The book is a good introduction to the work, more detailed information is available on www.friendsofthecasa.com and a bio of the author as well.I traveled to Abadiania after reading the book and came away a believer. A back injury was manipulated by unseen hands on my second day by an 'invisible' operation. A must read for those interested in the subject of spiritual healing."
2,cheap and fake.,"The biggest problem: This drum needs a much better synthetic skin. Trying to coax out any of the subtle variations in overtones that make frame drums so unique is a chore with this thing.Secondly, the frame is just cheap particle board (a step above cardboard) with a wood laminate cover (a sticker, basically). don't waste your money -- cough up the cash for something better."
4,superior man,All people will benefit by reading this insightful book about a man's journey through life. I found it to be enlightening and honest. I doubt many men will be up to the challenge.
1,A Misleading Self Help Book,"Deida's writing is evocative and makes me want to strive to reach my potential, but almost all of his specific examples and techniques seem ridiculous. In my experience there is certainly a gender binary, but it doesn't manifest the ways he suggests. He says that people either want to be dominant or submissive in relationships, but that is only true for a very small portion of the people I've met. Reading it only a small part of it rang true for me. One concept he stresses in every of the 50 chapters is ""male essence"" and ""female essence"" and by the end of the book I am still not sure I fall into either one."
5,"*Must Read* For EVERY Man, Everywhere","Stop reading this review, and BUY THIS BOOK.I've read hundreds of books in my life, well over 50 on psychology and relationships... This is the best one BY FAR."
5,Excellent book to read to discover yourself,"This is an excellent book to read. The author explains lot of information about how to be a real man. He has good point view on issue on how woman's like. I have total change my life after reading this book. It a very ""POWERFUL"" book to read if you want to discover yourself. It's never to late to find out that you are. You need to love yourself if you want someone else to love you. My therapist recommended this book to me. The author is so right about everything in this book. I will be reading this book again and again to remind myself the important of being a man, a Superior man. I 've never written a review before, so this is my first time, but I have to get this book lot of credit for very powerful information and advice he makes..."
2,mostly about sex,This book is mostly about sex and sexuality. I was hoping for something more about spirituality. I suppose this book has some good ideas for improving your marriage and love life. The text also has tips about understanding women which is always a problem for men.
2,Hardly spiritual and hardly worth buying.,"This book couldn't teach me anything. The only thing original about it was that it had nothing to teach. I dislike giving bad reviews, but I also dislike dishonesty... Avoid this book if you're looking for a book to propel you sky-high. This book will hardly get you off the ground."
5,"""Don't Do Anything You Don't Want To Do For Your Woman"" David Deida","Be true to yourself first and foremost. Let go of your male tendencies to want to understand and fix your woman...just as she must let go of trying to fix you. Watch her, love her, appreciate her...Understand that the feminine is much like the ocean. Do you ask the ocean why the waves are big today or try to do anything about it. Instead, revel in the beauty of her passion. Learn to appreciate the vigor of her extremes. Recognize her and when she seems totally out of control, be daring and step into that energy and hold her close. Keep your mouth shut and let her know that she is loved.Men...if you care about your woman and want to go deeper in your relationship....read this book."
3,Insightful.........,"This book was insightful to a point, however the main theme in the book seemed to be redundant about a man ""finding himself"". I'm a few months shy of thirty years old here and I don't need a fortune teller to guide me through the dark. I have done that already and have found my way. (Now, before anyone gets huffy about the coming statement, I am not a misogynist in any way, shape or form, I love women and do have a steady girlfriend and am chivalrous towards her and all women). Now then, with that disclaimer out of the way.... I did enjoy the section in this book that inform men that women will test you in a conscious or subconscious way. Also, the section that basically talks about a man remaining on ""HIS"" path to being completely fulfilled and how that is attractive with the opposite sex.Those two little pieces of information in this book make it worth purchasing....Hope this helps a little!"
2,pure poetry,This book was highly recommended to me so I went and read it. He has some insight in to women like how men think analytically and women emotionally. he uses a lot of poetry and verbose quite a lot but the basis of the book is just that. If you enjoy poetry and want to try some of the authors meditations practices then you might enjoy this more than I.
1,Metro-sexual how to guide to emasculating ones self.,"Save your money and your time, steer well clear of this book. Annoying, new age, sensitive new age guy, left wing, metro-sexual, wanna-be intellectual gibberish. If you want to emasculate yourself and appear sophisticated while doing it, then this may be your thing. A well know person from the PUA community recommended this book in one of their products, maybe this explains the undeserved high score for this book. He's a very good sales person with the gift of the gab and people hate to admit to themselves that the recommendation is bad, considering how much they paid for his products and how much of an oracle he's meant to be.If you are looking for a great personal development book for men, then get your hands on a copy of Dr Robert A Glover's book, ""No More Mr Nice Guy"". Also on a lighter and un-PC note is the very funny, yet a lot of truth to it book, ""Nice Guys Don't Get Laid"" by Marcus P Meleton Jr."
2,Over the Top?,"A bit dramatic and over the top, but some interesting ideas about what to do with your impending orgasm. Is this Tantra? is happiness a result of secret initiations and achieving superiority or of opening up to your ordinariness and allowing the miracle of the everyday to manifest itself. Why polish the nonexistent mirror?"
3,"good book,","the book has very nice ideas, however a lot needs to be developedand maybe the author has done so, by writing other books ""the way of the superior lover"" ""intimate Communion""which as i beleive makes readers lost, i mean the books supposedly are dealing with the same subject,why make 3 or books when you can group them into 1 and give the reader the value he is looking for?"
1,disappointed,This book was VERY dissappointing . It is all very vague material as if the author is trying to appear very enlightened and spiritual but only succeeds in saying a whole lot of nothing.
3,An accurate assessment of the general picture.,"Specifically; each individual is different, some manifest greater or lessor masculine/feminine traits regardless of whether they are Female or Male.For those who are closer to the center of defaul behaviour, this book will help communication up to the point where they evolve beyond their collective limited behaviours or sexual programming, beyond that a more evolved approach should be considered that takes into consideration the evolving sense organs and +/- balances in their personality as a result of their growth.But all in all a good book to clarify default behaviours and the habits of those personalities that are addressed in the book."
5,A man has to act like one!,"Being a man and being a woman are things dictated to us by our bodies, basically by our sexualities. So superior man is the one who inherits his genes from the most basic form of male gene. That is why he is superior, and this book basically makes that point plenty clear. That is all."
4,"Bought it as a gift, ended up reading it myself","He is right on when he says, basically, hug it out when a woman is feeling emotional. Try it guys, it works."
3,not what I expected it to be,"The book was not what I expected it to be based on a friend's recommendation, but still offers enough sound advice to be worth reading once. More importantly it does a very good job of clearly stating its intended audience & purpose in the very first chapters.I'd recommend borrowing the book from a friend/library or reading up to that point in a bookstore to find out whether the book is for you.If you are the sort of person David Deida is trying to reach with the book, then by all means it should be an excellent read."
3,"Good material, but not for a beginner necessarily.","The material is very good for people who are into the more esoteric depth work. However, I would not recommend this for someone who does not have any experience with sacred sexuality, tantra, and the more loftier forms of internal work. There are a lot of terms and concepts used that I feel someone brand new would have to really research before just diving in. I also found the work boring in spots and labored to keep my interest up. I have to say in all the author put a lot of material into this work and he asks for some leaps of faith, but the work was not really that impressive to me. I would suggest ""King, Warrior, Magician, Lover"" by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette if you want to start on your path of Men's Studies and Male Wholeness."
5,"Enhance , embrace and love your male self","I am still reading this book and will hate for it to end, as it is very insightful and helpful for me in my relationship. I have read many books that speak to these issues but in mystic, ancient and overly poetic phrases. David cuts to the chase and makes his point to the psyche of the American (but not limited to) male and female. David uses real life situations that we all experience in the life of a relationship. I often find myself pausing and reflecting on the valuable information shared in this book. I highly recommend this book to men who truly love women and want to continuously grow in a new redefined male identity."
2,not a masterpiece,I expected more from this book. Although some of the insights were nice I didn't get any 'Aha' moments or something that really made a difference in my life.
5,Embrace your masculine power,"""This book is a guide for a specific kind of newly evolving man. This man is unabashedly masculine--he is purposeful, confident, and directed, living his chosen way of life with deep integrity and humor--and he is sensitive, spontaneous, and spiritually alive, with a heart-commitment to discovering and living his deepest truth."" ~ David Deida from ""The way of the Superior Man""This is a powerful book. If you're conservative, it's going to push your edges and might be too much for you. However, if you're a man who's committed to living his life at his edge, understanding the ideas of masculine and feminine energy and how they play out in intimate sexual relationships, then this book is pretty much a must-read.In my experience, you may not always agree with everything Deida says, but you can be assured your perspective will expand--getting you one step closer to living your own highest truth."
3,Worth reading... But not a masterpiece.,"The problem with this book is that it is written in a very vague manner. Many of the concepts are not clearly explained. I felt like I understood what he was saying, but in the end it turned out to be just a feeling. Another problem is that the book is heavy with spiritual mumbo-jumbo... If you can get past those two problems, the book is definitely worth reading. It has some good concepts to share, interesting frames of refference, and ought to influence you positively (assuming you dont read into it too much.)"
4,It's never too late to learn,"Although some of the book is written in language a little too touchy-feely for my tastes, there's a significant amount of useful information any man who loves women could profit from. Mr Dieda, I think, has had some very close female friends along w/ lovers - there's a good deal of insight that I feel could only have originated from some very self-aware women. Much of it rings intuitively true - such as the reasoning behind mood changes & saying the opposite of what is intended. These are facets of women which have frustrated me, & no doubt, many millions of other men, our entire lives.What is left out, and can't be accounted for, are the additional neuroses which complicate, and ultimately doom to failure so many relationships. Mr Dieda's ideal here, is the interchange between two reasonably balanced individuals. Finding that is already a tremendous challenge, but at least, with greater insight, we can have better odds of genuine success with greater understanding."
3,Do you really need a book to tell you to be a Man?,"Some things in life are just common sense, and needing a book to tell you how to be a man goes against that. I guess if you stopped giving a damn about proper gender roles and complacent in your role in life, a little pick me up is in order. I myself think you should read this, laugh at the absurd stuff, understand the good stuff... but mostly be brave enough to want to change, because that is something no book can teach."
2,"some insight, some idiocy","This book sounds like it is based on a very narrow understanding of women. While some parts ring true, i.e. if my love life stinks , nothing feels right, other parts of the book will get men on the wrong track for a woman like me. I find his chapter on the reliability of what women say ridiculous. Though I can get quite emotional, I generally mean what I say and do not do a 180 degree turn five minutes later because my mood changes.I have read two other books of Deida's. I believe he may have some insight into the male psyche, which makes sense since he has one, but for understanding women or more complex men he falls short."
3,Not for me,"A few really good points such asAlways listen to your heart, don't do what others suggest you do if you know it is wrong.And some other good stuff."
4,"Unfortunately, Deida's understanding of most women is correct","I was in a relationship for eight years which ultimately failed, and this book is to some degree showing me where I went wrong. Although I would like to think that there are some women out there to whom his his teachings don't apply to, I think most women are as irrational as this book suggests. Its a great book to help you understand most women and how to ignite their sexual attraction for you. What I find unfortunate is Deida is reminding me that that the burden of generating romantic interest falls on men, but if you want a girl in your life his is a good book to teach you how to keep the attraction alive."
2,Wanted to like it...,"I listened to the audiobook version based on the recommendation of a friend of mine. I had high hopes for it but was very disappointed. I'm not saying the book has no value, but what I am saying is that the value in this book could be condensed into a very concise 8-10 sentance paragraph. It is so diluted by pseudo-scientific psychobabble that the author ends up repeating himself over and over and ultimately ends up actually saying very little. For a book about being a better man this guy sure does talk about emmotions in the most feminine way I can imagine. My wife wouldn't even talk like that. It's also worth noting that in the audiobook version the author sounds like a very feminine Ben Stein. Only worth noting because it's hard to take advice on being more masculine from a guy that sounds like that. I found myself working very hard not to discount everything he was saying. There are much better books out there about being a better man."
1,the way of the superior man,"This guy is a fruitback, and a sexual predator. Page 98, he talks about hooking up with 18 year old, this guy is sick. He is one of those duchebags who never had a girl but knows everything about them, go figure. If you don't believe me check out his mugshot on the back. This book is a waste of time!!!"
1,Never received the book!,"I do not know what happened, but I never received the book. Therefore, I cannot write a proper review."
2,Mumbo-jumbo,"""What She Wants Is Not What She Says"" and ""Her Complaint Is Content-Free"" are but two of the chapter titles of this book. (Don't forget ""Ejaculation Should Be Converted or Consciously Chosen"" and ""Ejaculate Up the Spine,"" either.) It's not all woo-woo: there is probably some truth to some of the author's assertions -- but really, I think this book is squarely aimed at men like the author, who are after the sort of relationship that just may not be possible. Probably great for people who have liked his other books, likeThe Enlightened Sex Manual: Sexual Skills for the Superior Lover, but really not so much so for those who think that, though men and women are different, they are still the same species. To be fair, this *is* billed as a *spiritual* guide, and sexual desire makes an appearance in the subtitle, as well. But it's just not my style. Check out some sample pages before buying, at least."
2,I'm not sure Arthur J. Converse's review is valid,Arthur J. Converse's review seems less then authentic . . . he seems less than open to spiritual concepts. I'm dissapointed in him. I think he is predicatable.
3,Good info but very convoluted,"This book is mostly accurate and the info is good, but to understand it you have to wade through all the spiritual fru-fru stuff that shrouds the book's message, which becomes quite convoluted as a result.Better alternatives would be material from David DeAngelo, or for guys just looking for practical info on meeting women, Mystery's book and course. Otherwise, this is a good choice for those who are really into this stuff and want as much info as they can get on it."
5,How To Build a Heart AND a Spine,"After reading The Way of the Superior Man, my perpective on women and dating completely changed. It made me see things I never knew were in me, and things I never saw in women before. Once you go through the book, you'll go through it again because there is an immense amount of information. One fact in the book that most guys don't know, 90% of women's emotional problems come from feeling unloved. In the book he'll tell you how to deal with any relationship issue you could have (It isn't typically what you think it is). He also explains the difference between men that become lovers and men that end up in the ""just friends"" category with women. Truly one of the best books ever on not just becoming a superior man, but a mature man."
2,hmm,"I spent a long time thinking about this book, which I received as a review copy. There are many interesting elements of it, and some explanations of male psychology which seemed helpful. However, in the end I found the author's view of women and of male-female relationships to be troubling. Deida seems to see himself as a guru, and this book (and another of his I read after this one) ultimately seemed to me to be tainted by misogyny and provide a sad, shrunken sense of what is possible in our lives, and of what is true."
5,High powered self assessment tools...,I'd recommend the CDs to anyone interested in a different way to take your motivations to another level. The audio has held my attention each time I play it
3,"Not bad, but not very good either.","I read this book with an open mind but I am just not completely sold on all of its ideas. While he does make some good points that I do agree with (e.g., a man is not satisfied until he has found his purpose in life, his views on sex and intimacy) I disagree with most of his ideas (e.g., furthering gender stereotypes).Is it worth the read? I would say that it's at least worth a glance to see if you like it. Do I think that everything in the book should be taken seriously? Definitely not."
4,A fairly good self help book for men with women.,"The book is targeted towards men, mescaline men possibly women, who want to be the object of desire for feminine women.The book has excellent insight on this subject matter. However, it also becomes a bit broad and misguided at times. On the other hand, due to the books design, the book is split up to sections that only have a few pages explaining the header. This allows for the reader to skip over sections he feels are irreverent or unnecessary.Overall, the book is a good read for those who are interested in this subject, the subject of love and passion."
1,A Feel Good Guide for the Small Man,"Basically a manual for the desperately insecure man-child who will inevitably partner with his needy unformed female equivalent and mould her to suit. For in this text there is no mention of the 'whole women' as we know her.Without doubt The Way Of The Superiour Man is unbelievable tosh. It is however an excellent example of the worst type of self publishng - tedious, wordy, opinionated barely disguised biography of angst that is about as spiritual as a turnip. The author himself is a master self promoter. Remember you can sell a load of books when you offer incentives."
2,This book blows,"At the risk of sounding like a bored, angry teenager who spends too much time on the internet: I really thought this book blew. I didn't read much of it (Why would I take the time to read a book I didn't like). But what I did read was stupid and cheesy. I'm embarrassed to even have this book in my home."
5,NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT!,I picked up this book on a whim and I was amazed! Reading this book could quite possibly change your life for the better!
2,"Cliche ridden, pep talk Heavy, content free","I didn't really care for this book. Its advice can be summed up as: be a real man, get yourself a woman who is all emotion and no intelligence, who will never be able to explain anything she does and who will fall into your arms every time you kill something and sigh ""MY HERO."" Never relate to her on any level more complicated than that, ravish her mercilessly and she will be yours forever."
4,If you're a man or a woman...,...this is a great book. You don't have to agree with everything but there is a lot of great information in the book.
1,Some of this is quite silly,"While I agree with some of this book the bits about men needing to always maintain theior composure, humour, and love in the face of female insanity is quite hard to swallow. Just try and be that way a few years into a marriage with a woman who is always raging. Sadly, some women are simply too irrational for the average male to be able to understand and deal with. IN these cases it's est for the man to leave...at least temporarily than trying to be some love studmuffin who oproclaims that he will ravish her and then follow through.Sometimes her anger is a real turn-off, Dave."
5,MUST reading for all men,"This is the 'how-to"" book our fathers could never write (God bless them), and the best men's book on relationship I've ever read. Not because it teaches you tricks, or how to please a woman, but because it it shows men how to stand in our masculine power as our true selves, rather than someone who denies themselves to please others. I could never be in the incredible relationship I'm in today without the lessons I've learned from this book, and that includes having clear boundaries where self respect, awareness, integrity and purpose must come first in our lives. We always get the relationship we deserve...this book helps us deserve more. I use this book as a basis for the men's group I'm leading."
5,Masculine is as Masculine does!!,"I read this before readingWill Work for Women: The Guide on How to Meet, Attract, and Date Women. This book goes more into depth on the features of a masculine man. While ""Will Work for Women"" goes more into how to meet women. I like the overlapping concepts and how you can see a trend of male improvement. This book is honest and inspiring. I think it is essential that any man look at the concepts in this book if he wants to learn how to have a relationship with a woman or wants to learn how to improve himself. I give this book my highest recommendation!"
2,Pseudo scientific nonsense all,"This book is 100% pseudoscientific nonsense and conjecture based on the opinions of one man. That said, there is some decent philosophy here, although it is super sexual in nature and completely phallocentric. It's like a spiritual book on human relations written by a man whose penis is his god.Let me save you hours of redundancy sum it up in two sentences. As a man, find your true direction in life and live life to the fullest, giving the world and ""your woman"" all your love and gifts. Live in accordance with your calling and sexual and relationship success will follow.Add in a bunch of new age baloney about spiritual energy flows and living life as a giant erection having sex with the world and life in general and there you go. Deida's not wrong about how male and female interact, but seriously, this book sucks."
3,"Insightful, full of spiritual mumbojumbo, needs science","Interesting concepts, but targeted towards patchouli wearing new agers. Not much for the average guy to grasp without a mouthful of spiritual mumbo jumbo. Read it, you might make some insights into your own life, but read it with a pillar of salt. Deida, I know you read these things, take a hint from your buddy Christopher Ryan and use some science or at least try to follow the method in your next book...."
1,The way of the inferior man,"""I want you my bitch"". I kid you not. This is the kind of ""illuminated"" advice this self-appointedvoice of the male New Age puts out there.If your relationship needs a little help, this advice (and more) will completely kill it off. If you're looking to improve yourself as a man, this is the wrong road or certainly a road that ""won't"" lead you on a loving path to a lasting relationship, let alone happiness.Wish I hadn't lost the time listening to this and went to a snake-handling church instead.At least the snakes are in plain view there!"
2,great if you enjoy monotone voices,sort of an on-going monotone diatribe.im sure there's something here but it's a little patronizing.this guy's a bit stuck on himself and there's better material out there.
5,Excaellent Additon,"This is an excellent addition to the scanpan collection. Its stackable, so like bamboo steamers you can set several on top of one another and steam several items at once. Great for dim sum."
2,Really 10.25 inch!,"Have a set of ScanPan stainless (aluminum sandwich) cookware. But this does NOT fit. The steamer is 10 1/4"" while the large pot is 10"". See the other review - ScanPan only makes one size of these - this item description is wrong.With that said, while the steamer's indent won't fit properly in the top of the pot, it will sit on top, and I've used it that way to steam asparagus and other foods. Having the perforated bottom removable makes it really handy to load with food and to clean up afterwards. Just wish it fit right.BTW, I think the line of 10-inch pots are no longer offered by ScanPan."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this CD as a gift for my 4 year old twin granddaughters to listen to in the car. While the tunes are nice, each one has a different volume. As a result, you have to constantly adjust the volume for each song. It often wakes the kids if they have dozed off and causes the driver to be distracted."
2,Depressing opinions,"Greer has cleverly culled numerous negative examples from literature and history. Informed by her own prejudices and beliefs, she's come up with nearly four hundred pages of reasons for women to resent and dread the aging process, and the ways in which they will (inevitably, according to this book) be devalued. The chapters on allopathic, traditional, and alternative treatments are informative, also a chapter on the 'old wives' and 'witches' of history, but overall the forecast is grim. Chapters with flippant titles such as ""Sex and the Single Crone,"" ""Misery,"" and ""All Your Own Fault"" seemed more polemical than informative. Many of Greer's generalizations and assumptions are just plain silly, for example her statement that aging men want the energy of youthfulness, while women are content with its appearance (p.135). She's against makeup, too -- and has damning words for wearers of it."
1,dont buy from james,mine got really hot plugged into a surge protector and burned out the first day.tried to get help but there was none.be careful thats expensive education.
4,Seems to work as advertised,Just got it and hooked it up between a portable DVD player and my new DVD recorder. Installation is so simple that instructions are not necessary. This product eliminated the protected content signal on my copy of The Big Lebowski and I expect that I'll be able to back up all of our old Disney movies to DVD with this as well. I don't like that there is no on/off switch on this thing and the switching between modes could certainly be improved. I'd have given a 5 star rating if this thing had a power switch on it.
4,Written by a fascinating man,"The author is more interesting than the book. Cuthbert Vail Wright (1891-1948) rubbed elbows with famous writers such as Cozzens, Cummings, dos Passos, etc., while remaining in the shadows himself. He was a poet and an educator. A fellow teacher at his prep school described him as ""flamboyant, taking an Oscar Wilde pose, affecting a long cigarette holder, holding court for selected boys who interested him."" Wright often pretended to have been born in 1898 or 1899, but it is more likely that the year was 1891 or 1892. He was an Episcopalian when he wrote this book."
5,Incorrect info by Amazon on this page,"The Editorial Review, Inside this Book and Citations on the Amazon page for this book are not correct. They are for a different book.The Title, author and Product Details are correct."
4,A great look at parenting differences across different economic backgrounds,I was asked to read this for a class assignment and was delightfully surprised at what a great book it was! The different case studies about different families were very insightful into different types of parenting as well as how parenting and economics may impact children's achievement both in school and in extracurricular activities. A good read for those in the education field or for a parent interested in seeing how other families deal with the busy schedules of their children and how that may impact their family life.
5,Excellent research and book,"I used this book in a senior seminar that I taught in the fall 2005 semester on children's health, education and welfare, and my students thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Besides getting caught up in the narrative of the children's lives that she chronicles, Lareau's research helped them conceptualize how they could initiate their own small-scale research projects. Her book, better than most others like it, puts a human face on the aggregate statistics that show that socioeconomic class is strongly determinative of children's futures."
2,It works.,"This item is pretty flimsily made, but I guess you get what you pay for, and it wasn't expensive. Very difficult to keep the setting at zero to get the accurate weight of an item. On the up side, I did get it very quickly, so have no complaints about the vendor and the scale does work once you get it set."
3,Nice but not sure if I like it or not,I'm giving 3 stars as I'm not entirely sure I like it. Seems a bit cheap but guess what - only paid $10.00 for it so probably shouldn't have expected something of higher quality. As someone mentioned in an earlier post the print on the display is very small. Probably one thing I like least about it. And I'm not sure it's accurate but have to test further. I do like the fact I don't need batteries.I am thinking of returning it and getting something better quality.
4,Great little scale,"This is a nice little scale. The colors match my kitchen decor, it is dishwasher-safe and doesn't require batteries (a major plus, compared to come digital scales). The bowl is nice and wide and fits well on the scale. A good buy, I'm pleased."
4,Great at what it does,"I bought this scale to refill one pound propane tanks from a 20# tank for personal use in a buddy heater for ice fishing. I only gave it 4 stars because it is built kind of cheap plastic but it is perfect for what it does weigh the small tanks, you just have to be careful with it don't drop it. For the price you can't beat it."
3,Polder scale,"This scale works pretty well for the price, but I need something that will accurately weigh small amounts, like 4 - 6 ounces, and this one doesn't seem to accomplish that. If I put a 4 oz item on the scale, then weigh another item, and then return the first item to the scale, the weight will be different. For heavier items, it is more consistent."
3,"Good, but not quite worth the cost","This is a good scales. It's reasonably the bowl is a decent size, but it's difficult to accurately set it to zero without significant error. But for what I use it for, it's fine.Overall, I don't think it was worth what I paid for it, but it does what it says on the box, so I'm happy with it."
3,I FEEL BAD GIVING 3 STARS,"Okay let me explain the word ""chrome"" made me buy it, i just thought it was going to be a nice cute sized metal scale. It was just looks like chrome coated that is gonna chip. I think they should just name it Add and Weigh Kitchen scale. the words deluxe, gourmet, and chrome are not well represented. IT WORKS OK THAT ACTUAL SCALE WORKS, but the bowl i thought would be some sort of glass its just normal plastic. Well it arrived on time and it was $14.79 so wat the heck"
5,"REM are great, get this if you havn't",REM rock! Get this CD. It has some great hits. Crush With Eyeliner is one of their best. Buy this if you havn't
1,"A Movie That Is Really, Really Dumb and Not Worth Watching!","This video is A cheap, wanna be to the Back to the Future movies. It's an insult to the actors and characters. Don't bother, Their Already Here( if you know what I mean)!"
1,Trash,"Like all Oxfordian volumes, this is nothing but a collection of historical errors, misstatements, ridiculous logical leaps, and intellectual dishonesty."
5,I'm not going to waste your time with an excess,"of verbiage. Anderson's biography of Oxford tells the man's story assuming he was Shakespeare. And the results are so astounding, the so called Stratfordians no longer have straw men to knock down in their dismissal of the theory. I urge you to read the work and make up your own mind about it. It is thorough, well researched, a thoroughly pleasant read."
5,By a de Vere on another de Vere,"Other reviewers have pointed out several of the hundreds of the Earl of Oxford connections to characters and references in the Shakespeare plays. I found particularly persuasive the argument that only the rich & privilefged had access to scarce books in the 16th century. William Shakespeare was neither. There is no explaination for the myriad historical, political and classical references in Shakespeare's plays other than that someone with an advanced classical education and access to a vast library wrote them."
1,Who Believes This Garbage?!?!?,"Finally read this book which is supposed to prove once and for all that Eddie Oxford wrote ""those"" plays.This book is 25% biog of Eddie, 75% absurd supposition. I won't go into the old Facts that Oxfordians have brainwashed themselves to imagine around. I will recommend this:Read some Forums on pro-Oxford websites.Then read similar sites about ""The Holocaust Hoax"" and ""JFK Conspiracies"". You will find the SAME types of people in both worlds. I love it when Baconians, Marlans & Oxfordians (all CONVINCED that their idol wrote you-know-who's poems & plays) go at each other with the kind of hatred most people reserve for Hitler & Satan.To see how FAR this can go, reference ""Shakespeare's Fingerprints"", a book which attributes ALL of Elizabethan literature to Edward De Vere.This is garbage, plain & simple. Don't get caught up in this rubbish."
5,Len Deighton's Masterpiece of 'What If',"SS-GB is undoubtedly Deighton's best work of fiction. The basic premise presupposes a Nazi victory over Great Britain sometime in early 1941, (Presumably after a failed evacuation from Dunkirk and a disasterous Battle of Britain.) The story itself takes place later that year and earily accounts a Nazi occupation of England. While the protagonist falls a little too often into the 'cop on the edge' cliche, the fast paced plot, centering around the rivaly between the S.S. and Wehrmacht, will keep the reader riveted. Must reading for all fans of 'What If' history and more than enough tension for readers of international suspence."
4,Interesting Story,"This was an interesting story. I have read a large number of World War Two historical fictions and this is the first time I have come across this topic. The detective is a good character, sure there are a lot of stereotypes with him but we all expect that and the author uses them to his advantage. The ending was a bit fast; a few more pages would have done the book justice. Overall a good effort that should not take you too much time to read. If you are a fan of this author then you defiantly should read the book"
5,It helps you understand what divorced kids are going through,"This is a really interesting book, it expains what young children go through when there parents get divorced. I think it could help a lot of young kids when they have to through this. I think any parent who is cruel enough to make the child decide which parent to live with at the age of 13 or any age is wrong and they don't deserve to have that child either. It should never be put upon a child to decide what parent he should live with how could child make that descion, he/she would think well if I don't choose dad he'll be mad, but if I don't choose mom, she'll be mad at me. How could any child make that decsion, I think that this book could really help kids with divorced parents and it would probably help divorced parents too."
1,Defective DVD,"Purchased DVD for husband's birthday. Gave it to him the evening of Dec. 27, 2012. We watched three of the movies. They were great. The fourth movie, Assination, was defective. The audio was garbled and the video was jerky. Would like a replacement if possible. Please advise."
5,Loved these as a kid!,"Today I was adding books to my son's wishlist, he is 3 years old, I remembered this series and immediately added them to the list. I read all of these books! Every single one in the series when I was a kid in the early 80s? I couldn't get enough of them. I am crossing my fingers that I kept some of them in the archived boxes of my childhood but in the meantime, I may just start buying a few.It's fuzzy what the stories were about but I do remember laughing and feeling challenged at the same time to work things through with the Great Brain.What a joy to find them. And I can't wait until my son is a little older to start reading them together."
4,Fun for children!,"The Great Brain was first published in 1967, but the antics of Tom are still relevant and charming. Tom comes from family of Catholics in a town that is heavily Mormon in Oklahoma. The author handles the religious differences with humor, as well as in the perspective of children. In this first Great Brain, Tom and his brothers come across many adventures, including helping a new Greek friend learn how to fight, saving friends lost in a cave, and getting indoor plumbing! While Tom has financial motivators in most of his antics, the boys learn many lessons about friendship, family, and life. As the author of,Camp Bug Juice: A Bookworm's Camp Adventure, writing for children is complicated, but the Great Brain is a wonderful classic!"
4,The Brown School Book Club,"It was adventuous and funny. T.D. and J.D. are just great. T.D. is a smart swindler. Once he tried to get his mean new teacher fired and he almost succeeded! Most people , especially adults, can't figure out they're being swindled. We are the Brown School Book Club: Debbie, Chelle, Michael, Matthew, Sylwia, Kelsey and our leaders Meg and Glenn. This book is one of our favorites!"
3,Great Brain,This is likely a good book but our almost 5-year-old son was not yet interested. We will save for when he is a bit older.
2,Sociopathic kid,"My older sister read the Great Brain books to me when I was little and I remember really liking them - while being a little unsettled by them. My sister was a bit like TD and I was a lot like JD. So the books hit a little too close to home.I bought The Great Brain with plans to read it to my daughter. I started reading it myself to see if I thought she'd actually enjoy it. I hated it! TD is a rotten, mean little kid who plays head games with his friends and family. The parents are pathetic. The dad is in ""awe"" of TD when he schemes to get his teacher fired by planting alcohol on him. Any time he does the right thing, it's for the wrong reasons. It would have been a great book to read in my college ethics class.I won't be reading it to my daughter. I'd have to wait for my husband to leave town, since he'd hate it more than me. I might leave it in my sister's stocking for Christmas - along with a lump of coal!"
4,The Great Brain,This book is very good.My favorite part in this book is when this kid beat Sammy and wins the title of the best wrestler in their town. What was amazing was that this kid got his leg taken off. The reason is because he stepped on a rusted nail and his lower hlf of his leg got infected by it. He didn't belive he could do it but he did. This is a really good back book and every one should read it.
4,great brain,sean wills. it was a great story but how could it be all true.I think the parents should of done somthingmore severe then the silent treatment. I read someof the secondn book I'd give it 5 stars.
4,The Great Brain,"John ,Tom and Swenn are in this funny book and Tom with his great brain is always trying to get rich and gets into trouble. Tom helps a Greek boy named Basil become American. He cheats his own brother out of a rare belt and a lot more. I really loved how the story came out. So that is why I loved this book."
3,OK,"The book ""The Great Brain""was ok some times it keepet my intrest and some times it didn't but over all i thought it was a good book."
5,Funny but also sometimes very dark...,"The Great Brain, Tom D. Fitzgerald, is a very smart, but also very greedy boy, who finds all kinds of ways to make a penny (back when a penny was worth something). The chapters mostly involve him trying to con people out of their money OR trying to make money from schemes that most of us would think of as unethical.Yet he also uses that great brain to solve problems for others kids, such as Andy who thinks he is so plump useless without his lost leg that he tries to kill himself or the Jenson kids who got lost in the Skeleton Caves.The chapter on Abie, his strongbox and his pride really got to me and I'm not sure how a kid, even a mature one, will respond to the issues brought up in that part of the book.The book is bitter-sweet, the fantasy of the good old days mixed with realistic themes of every day life."
5,On to the next generation,My brother (also a great brain) and I loved these books as children. When going through some old boxes I found our hard worn copies and ordered a new set to share with my son.He is reading them at 6 and loves The Great Brain. My son wants them to make a movie so he can play Tom. :-)
5,timeless entertainment,"As a young Mormon boy in Australia, 'The Great Brain' series was one of my fondest boyhood reads. I enjoyed the series so much I recently forced my wife to read the book. She loved it and has just finished reading it to my 3 month old son. I am considering buying the entire series so that my boy can grow up loving it like it did. The fact that it is set 100 years ago is meaningless as everyone of any age can enjoy the stories and simple childhood fun of the Fitzgerald brothers and the rest of Adenville."
5,I hope these never go out of print,"John Dennis Fitzgerald intended to chronicle his youth in Utah for adults, not children. His publisher thought otherwise and the result are these gems. I don't even call them children's lit gems because I find them just as enjoyable as an adult. Before I go on, you should know that Fitzgerald wrote one book about his youth that is for adults, called ""Papa Married a Mormon"". It is one of the most amazing books on the American west that I have ever read. Sadly, it is out of print, and you may, like me, have to pay an exorbitant sum to get a copy. Trust me, save up and do it. Now back to this book. Every single Great Brain book in the series is pure gold, and the entire set can be had cheaply, so I say buy them all at once. I ""put my money where my mouth is"" as Tom the Great Brain would say, and bought the lot."
2,"good timer, but Amazon bought a bad batch","I've used this triple timer before for almost a year, often on a weekly and sometime daily basis. I bought it from a culinary store. It worked fine, even after it was dropped on a concrete sidewalk once. So I decided to buy two more from Amazon, and they worked okay except for the 3rd part of the triple timer, it wouldn't reset its memory correctly unless you completely clear it a zero again. A hassle, probably a defect in the software/hardware. Other than that, it works okay."
1,Polder 891-90 Triple Kitchen Timer,"My daughter was attempting to use the timer on an older refrigerator -- one that magnets DO adhere to -- it was placed on carefully, and fell off.She tried again, it fell off AGAIN; and this time broke. It was a stocking present for a 28-year old who loves to bake and wanted it so she could multi-task.I would say we are not pleased at all!Item: Polder 891-90 Triple Kitchen timer/clock/stopwatch"
1,Not worth the money,"Very disappointed in this timer. I like the idea of having three timers in one, and frequently need this feature. But this product falls short: the ringer is so low that it can be hard to hear it if there is any other sound in the room. The buttons are hard to push. The operation is certainly not intuitive - poor design to need a 'mode' button to get from timer 1 to timer 2 to timer 3. Even though my last OXO timer died far too quickly, I will purchase another one, because its design is superior. I prefer being able to set the time using number buttons rather than scrolling through minutes starting from 1. What a shame - I thought this would be much better than it is."
2,Seems to work OK but counter-intuitive and poor workmanship,"The timeris not intuitive to operate but,once mastered, seems fit for purpose. However within 2 weeks, the magnetic stick-on strip that bonds unit to fridge door etc fell away from the unit dropping it to the floor. Had to stick back on with Super glue! That is just shoddy manufacture"
1,Absolute junk,"In the store, wrapped in its packaging, this timer looked so impressive. Sadly, it turned out to be absolute junk. The latch on the battery cover is so cheaply constructed that every time I grabbed the timer off my refrigerator (it has a magnet back), the cover would break off and stay stuck to my refrigerator. The alarm sound can be described as unpleasantly piercing and, as others have mentioned, weak. Sometimes I barely heard it. Battery life was also a problem as the timer has no ""off"" or ""sleep"" mode. It just stays on until the battery goes. After all this, my timer lasted about a year before it stopped functioning completely. Please learn from my mistake, don't buy this timer!"
1,Poorly made,"I, too, have had nothing but trouble from this timer. It worked fine for the first month or six weeks, although as others have noted the buttons are excessively debounced and have to be pressed and held to function. After that initial period of unenthusiastic mild satisfaction, however, it began to ""freeze"" sporadically and, more recently, continuously. Even the kids now know how to remove the battery cover, take the battery out for a few seconds, and replace it to reset the timer. I ordered a new (different) timer today, and figured I'd stop by here and leave this review while I was thinking about it. Avoid this thing."
1,Not loud,"This is my second purchase of this product. My wife tried to clean the first one and ruined it. It worked quite well.The replacement (about 4 years later) was not as loud as the original. It required fewer batteries, so my thought is they remanufactured it to be more energy efficient.Unfortunately the new alarm is significantly quieter rendering it essentally unusable."
1,Quiet,"Can't hear the beeper unless your in the same room. Evan than it is very quiet, can't hear it over faucet running.What a waist for a timer. Maybe I got a bad one I don't know, but I am not going to pay to ship it back, only to find out that the beeper is as loud as it gets.No I have no hearing problems, or tone impairment."
1,Too Quiet,"This timer would be great if you were a librarian! There is no way you could here it if you were in the other room. Maybe I just got a defective one. Also, the quality looks a little cheep. I am going to return it and get a different one."
2,Great while it works,"This triple timer is really terrific, however, as noted elsewhere, it stopped working after about 8 months of use. Freezes when you try and set a time higher than a few minutes and you have to take the battery out to reset it. After a month or so of that, the removing of the battery no longer helps and it's useless. Too bad..if it worked I would highly recommend this style of timer to everyone."
1,Weak Beep,Nice appearance but very weak volume on beep. Relatively easy to set and move between three timer settings. No obvious way to increase volume of beep.
1,Recommended by Cook's magazine but a big disappointment,"While this unit was not at the top of Cook's list, it was recommended. There are three significant problems - the first I think is fatal. You can hardly hear the alarm go off. The second problem is to time something for 45 minutes you need to hit the minute button 45 times! The third problem is the battery life is quite short only about one month. Given the price of this unit it is not worth the money and at any price they could have done a much better design job. I am also quite surprised at Cook's rating. I would not advise anyone to purchase this timer."
2,Read other reviews - but ignored them,"After reading the negative reviews about this timer, I purchased it anyway after having being satisfied with other Polder products. It has plenty of timer functions, which is great, but like other reviews had mentioned, the alarm is not loud enough to hear and the magnet is not strong enough to hold it up. I will have to keep looking for another one."
2,A Lesson Learned.......,"Being lost without a timer for everything!, I purchased this to replace one that jumped into the dishpan...... Having a clock and the ability to time three events at once are great features, but the alarm is too soft. I have hearing problems, but even at a distance to 12-15 inches, the alarm is easy to miss. Even my sharp eared children agree. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.... a lesson learned for me."
2,Long time user of timers,"Polder Triple Digital Timer - WhiteI agree with the some of the other reviews. The alarm is too soft and Polder is falsely advertising the product on their packaging by stating the following ""Loud 60 sec. automatic alarm sounds when programmed time is reached."" It is anything but loud. I owned a West Bend triple timer for 20 years and you could hear the alarm from another room. With the Polder, you can barely hear it standing next to it. If you had the radio on, you probably would not hear it. West Bend's new unit does not work like the previous one, otherwise, I would have purchased theirs. Also, the Polder unit display cannot be turned off and it wastes battery life. The West Bend display could be turned off. Looks to me like Polder didn't do much testing of the unit with prospective customers. The drawbacks are too obvious. West Bend made a mistake it changing a product that consumers were satisfied with."
1,"Poorly designed, poorly made ...","The display - instead of being simply clear plastic over the LCD it's got a surface treatment (to prevent glare?) that becomes steadily more difficult to read through in a period of 3-4 months.The case - battery cover comes off at odd moments, the magnet popped off the backThe UI - only fairI've had 3 Polder timers - the first lasted until an accident took it out of commision (several years). Since then, I've had two different models and they've both worked poorly and failed very quickly.This product is a stellar example of what's wrong with many consumer goods today. Instead of making a product that we can pay a fair price for and use for 5-10 years (or more), we get sold junk that fills up landfills."
1,Another piece of junk in the name of cheaper products,"This unit is a perfect example of the junk we get in the US all in the name of lowering the price.The buttons stick, the battery life is abysmal, and the alarm is so weak, you better not be listening to music or watching TV, you'll never hear it!This is the last Polder I will ever buy. We are now forced into buying cheap electronics from Communist China (supporting their military buildup and oppression of Chinese citizens) because everyone wants lower prices! It's got to stop! Give me a choice, I will buy a quality product for more money if it performs well and lasts. Stop buying and selling junk like this!"
2,not so good,"This timer is inadequate in two ways. First, the volume of the beep is too low and can't be heard more than two feet away. Secondly, the LED began malfunctioning after a few months and made the readout illegible. I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Great timer,"As another reviewer mentioned, it is different than currently pictured. It does not have red buttons or slide switches on the side.Another reviewer complained about the feature where you have to move a little slide button to lock before pressing <Start>. In the actual model you do not have to do that.The only reason it's not getting five stars is because to switch between the clock/count up timer you have to press through count down timer 1, 2, and 3.Another great feature is that the 3 count down timers have a Memory functionality that you can pre-set. So say, you're doing laundry and it's going to take half an hour, you can preset timer 1 to 30 minutes and then just recall that time."
2,don't do it!!!!!,it's a little confusing to use and it's very easy to stop the wrong timer running because it doesn't automatically switch to the time going off. But the worst is it's whisper quiet. I bought this item for a professional bakery and the noise level is high. If your running your home mixer and the timer goes off unless your right by it you won't here a thing.
3,decent for a[n] [inexpensive] timer,"I've had this for a couple of years and have been using it mostly as a clock and back-up timer. It keeps time well enough, but it's supposed to be able to run two timers at once. I haven't quite figured out how to get it to do that. Even when I set it to run both, only one ticks off-so I still have to use a separate timer if I've got two things cooking at once. Otherwise, it's decent enough for most applications.And contrary to some reviewers, I've found the operation of this timer to be simple and fairly self-evident (with the one exception discussed above)."
1,JUNK,"Twice I had to return this product to the retailer.the manufacturer placed a protective plastic tape on the front of the timer, which when removed leaves a dull film on what should be a nice shiny plastic cover on this timer.however, most importantly, the alarm that should be loud, is so quiet, you can only hear it if it is within one foot of your ear.I contacted the manufacturer several times, WITHOUT A RESPONSE.Never again.!!"
1,Disappointing and inconvenient,"I was replacing a Westclock Triple timer and chose Polder because I have been happy with a remote meat thermometer with their brand. In order to use the timers you have to click through all three timers, the clock and a stop watch. If I wanted to repeat a 15 minute time, I had to reset the timer rather than just clicking again on the same timer as on the previous brand used."
2,Don't get it wet!,"I loved ours, but one day it fell into a stew I was cooking. I fished it out immediately, but it was too late, the mechanism was dead. I'm still looking for a waterproof kitchen timer..."
1,Heed the Other Reviews - This Thing is JUNK!,"For years we have used and enjoyed an older Polder Triple Kitchen Timer/Clock, but over time and use in the kitchen it had become yellowed and sticky. So I ordered a replacement. It was not until AFTER I ordered the replacement that I saw all the negative reviews about the newer editions of this product having an alarm that is so quiet as to be useless. Regrettably I have discovered it is TRUE. This timer cannot be heard even if you hang it around your neck. And it doesn't have a headphone jack. So, all-in-all, it is a totally useless, worthless, piece of junk. Don't buy this or any other Polder product until the prove themselves to be more responsibile to the consuming public."
1,Great.... if all you need is the lid,"I ordered this item. It was listed as being sold by Amazon. I picked up my package tonight only to find out that all that was shipped to me was the lid ! I can't be sure it is the right lid for this fryer since the fryer wasn't with it, not that I can use the lid without the fryer anyway. Now it says it is out of stock. I'm thinking it was out of stock when I ordered it even though it said there were 4 available. Guess you can't rely on what you see here. I am VERY disappointed. I called and am told I will be refunded. That's all well and fine, but right here before the holidays is not a good time for games. It makes no sense for them to have only shipped me a lid. It would have been a much more appropriate to have contacted me and let me know there wasn't really anything available. Instead, I get to deal with this hassle. Yay me !"
5,Wonderful!,"When Janis Ian sings, even though it's just a DVD, it sounds as if she is sitting right in front of you, and singing just to you.Her delivery of every song is perfect and over her 4 decade career sounds just as good as she did then.Anyone who appreciates folk, folk rock and singer songwriters, this DVD is a must for their collection."
1,Don't use too much heat with it!,"We are on our second pot and the same problem has occured -- the nonstick has bubbled out all round, close to the bottom. When we took the first one back to the shop because a small piece of the nonstick had completely peeled off, the manager told us that we must have used a metal implement and scratched it (not true). They replaced the first one, but refuse to take the second back saying we must have used too much heat. Apparently, it is important to gently introduce the pot to heat everytime you use it."
2,all our scanpans are sticking like crazy,"All the scanpans we have are sticking like crazy and are very difficult to clean. I emailed the manufacturer many days ago and received no reply. I wonder what ""Life time warrantee"" means.I found that a good stainless steel pan or a good cast iron pan will work much better in not sticking."
1,ScamPan,"I received my Scanpan in good condition, and thankfully read about the PTFE in this pan on the Scanpan web site before using it. The box the pan came in brags of how ""green"" the pan is yet never mentions the PTFE in the non-stick surface. According to Scanpan web site, heating this pan to high temperatures (those commonly used for stir-fry) could harm my birds, who fly to the kitchen to join me while I work. I doubt this pan healthy for humans, either, as I have read PTFE can interfere with female fertility. If I could I would give this pan zero stars. I returned it and received a full refund.I next purchased Cuisinart GreenGourmet Hard Anodized Eco-Friendly Nonstick 12-Inch Stir-Fry Wok with Glass Cover from Amazon--what a difference! Love this pan. Cook everything in it from bacon and eggs to you name it, every day. Will write a review for this pan sometime soon."
3,"great for medium heat, not so great for high heat","I was really excited to get the scanpan wok. However, I have found some pros and cons.What I really like: it is a really good non-stick pan, you can cook over medium heat, with no oil at all, and food cooks evenly and slides right out as if it is on a slick surface. I cooked this way for several times.Con: Then one day I used high heat to stir fry with a 2 tbsp of oil, the pan never performed as well afterwards. After using it on high heat just ONE time, the pan has a tendency to stick slightly. Always have to use more oil later, in order to get non-stick.Since I use it more for stir fry than stews, this pan is now relegated to the pantry.I think for the exorbitant $$$ cost, other woks that are cheaper perform better.If you cook only over medium heat, this is a FANTASTIC buy.If you stirfry often and need very high heat, this is NOT a good choice."
5,Gotta get these pans!,We own quite a few Scanpans and cannot say enough about them. Cooking is a pleasure with the no stick surface. They clean up like nothing you have used before and look as new as the day we bought them. We like them so much that now we buy scanpans for all our family members as birthday and Christmas gifts.
1,Contains PTFE--same as Teflon,"I bought this pan thinking that I am buying a non-stick pan without Teflon. While the health issue became questionable concerning Teflon, I am willing to pay extra to be safe, and at the same time still enjoying the non-stick feature. The product description somehow suggested that the pan is non-stick because it's ceramic titanium.Well, I was wrong, and I didn't know I was wrong until I accidentally browse the company's website and read its FAQ. In their FAQ, it says: ""The ceramic-titanium particles become one with the pan at that point. A subsequent application of a specially formulated PTFE provides the nonstick effect."" PTFE is the problematic element of Teflon. Well, I wish the company discloses this information somewhere on the product!"
4,The Positive Side of Globalisation,"It would be easy to file this one under the ever-increasing category of faceless world music aimed at western audiences, fortunately though, this cd rises above such temporary and disposable reflections of the postmodern state of music in 2006.The lovely Ashlene Nand, a Sydney music journalist now based in New York, started Bollyhood Records to promote the type of fusion of R&B;, bhangra and dancehall that eminates from every pour of this cd.Featuring artists such as Punchline and Bikram Singh, G Samra and Jade Foxx, Elephant Man and RDB, a better representation of the 'bhood' sound you will hard-pressed to find.Ashlene has fused together a diverse and undeniably fresh collection of South Asian musical delights which is certain to please all listeners with an open mind and fans of simply great music in general."
1,Wrong Rhubarb,"I thought this was the wonderful old movie about the cat and a baseball team. I was so excited to see it, and VERY upset that it's not the correct Rhubarb. Would the powers that be PLEASE put the old Rhubarb on video, as it's a classic!!! Plus where the phrase ""Having a Rhubarb"" in baseball comes from."
1,"Rhubarb--The ""Real"" One","I want to add my voice to the others. The Rubarb we all want is the one with the cat, baseball and Ray Milland. What gives? Does anyone have any ideas on how to get the studio or whoever owns it to release it? Its not even shown on The Turner Movie Channel anymore."
1,'51 Rhubarb,"I can't vouch for this site, but I believe copies of the Ray Milland film are available at www.bovinevideos.com -perhaps the info will help, if not, at least you can keep on the search:-)"
1,about the real Rhubarb,Huzzah!!! I just went to bovine.com and they do have copies of Rhubarb for $15.00 There's joy in kitty ville tonight.
1,Not the 1951 classic!,"Why can't the 1951 classic movie starring Ray Milland be found on video? The movie Rhubarb released by Paramount is another ""feel good"" baseball movie as the original ""Angels in the Outfield."" Cat lovers would also enjoy this film.Please Paramount,release your 1951 classic on video!"
5,1951 rhubarb/ ray milland,"what's the problem here? it's obvious this movie would be a big hit even today. i taped it about 15 years ago, but i can't find it. i want to see it again.and again!!"
1,Copy Right Infringment,"The Movie that every one seems to be talking about was Directed by Authur Lubin (1951) Staring: Ray Milland, Jan Sterling, Gene Lockhart, William Frawley. 94min. Language:English, B&WThe story is about a pro baseball team whos luck changes when they aquire a cat who earns the name (Rhubarb)(which means a big brawl or fight) in baseball terminology. And the oposition tries to do everything to get rid of Rhubarb, form Kitty napping to retaining a dog to try to maline the feline. Very well done, humorous family and sportsman entertainment for the whole family."
1,Where is Rhubarb The Cat?,"I am glad that I read the reviews from those who bought the aforementioned video thinking that they were going to see Morris' relative. Someone really is ""missing the boat"" in not having this all-time favorite on video!!!!! This is an excellent family movie, which is one of two favorites from my childhood, the other being ""Harvey"" and I have that video. About a year ago, I had email messages with Movie Mom and she agreed that we should have access to this movie. Maybe we should start a movement to get ""Rhubarb"" on video because, not only would I like to see it again, but I would like my niece and her family to see it, too! Does anyone have any sugestions?! I am quite serious about this. WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!!!!"
1,"Info on the ""real"" Rhubarb","For those of you who want the 1951 movie about the cat and the baseball team, it was produced and distributed by Paramount. They are probably the ones to contact about getting it released.An interesting sidebar: Leonard Nimoy made his first screen appearance (uncredited) in this movie."
1,THIS MOVIE FOR SALE IS NOT ABOUT A CAT,I got a British movie about a bunch of golfers. I guess I should have read all the reviews instead of the first one! DO NOT order this movie if you are wanting the 50's classic about a cat and a baseball team.
1,THE REAL RHUBARB,"I really wish the production company would release ""Rhubarb"" as seen with Ray Malland in 1951. It is a wholesome family movie and very enjoyable. PLEASE RELEASE RHUBARB FOR ALL TO ENJOY ON VHS."
1,I want RHUBARB THE CAT movie!,"I second, third, fourth, everyone who wrote in wanting Rhubarb The Cat movie. I totally agree with the viewer from Bothell, WA about starting a movement to get the movie about Rhubarb the cat on video. It is a great movie for all ages. I too saw it when I was a little girl.....so funny and cute! I can not believe that the makers of videos (and money) would leave that one out! It was also a popular book. Let me say it....WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!! Video Movie Makers get with the times.......get with the CAT -- RHUBARB THE CAT!!!"
1,False Advertisement,"This item originally was just the ""velourmat Red"" plus the long item number, it just recently changed to having a proper name including ""968"" in the title. However before this convenient name change, you would have no idea which car the product fit, except for what Amazon said. It told me this product was a ""fit"" for my 1983 Porsche 944 NA. Not true."
4,Great Linux reference for new and experienced users.,"This is a very well written book that explains all the ""need to know"" aspects of Linux and more. It has easy to follow steps to learn how to install and then begin using Linux. This is the best Linux book that I own and have read to date."
3,"Install works, but then you start into the book...","An intermediate computer user should be able to install without too much trouble from this book.Red Hat 6 is not exeptional for user-friendlyness, but if you need it, you should probably go Caldera.My problem is that the book is too massive. Even the intermediate/ advanced user is overwhelmed by 1000+ pages, each chapter by a different author. As the authors change, some sections are better than others, and there is little that is cumulative.(I also doubt too many of you want to program in Python, or even C++, and for those of you, the last third of the book is not much help.) 3stars."
1,Can't begin to tell you how much this book sucks!!,"This book is not for a beginner. It does not provide examples, and the layout is hard as hell to follow. Worst of all, some of the information in this book is out-right wrong! (such as the commands that doesn't work where the book insist that it would!)"
1,This is NOT for Beginner(newbie),"Frist becase of the cd contained in the book attracted me to buy the book. Yes.. it's cool!!! Installing was also perfect to me... Wow... really cool.... (but install description is not enough to understand) But I'm totally a new to Linux. After installing, I got stuck. I didn't know what to do. I opened the Introduction page in the bood and found that this book is not for newbie like me. Frustrated.I've just order another book, Running Linux(I hope this book help me a lot). I was acutally between Using Linux and Runing linux. The rating is only concerning beignner. So my rating may be not right. Later I'll come back and rate this book again when I'm used to linux. However, the fact I didn't know that this book was not intended to Newbie is my fault. In this case, I blame Amazon. You guys should have categorized them approriatly.. or mentioned them... How possible I could know what the book is like just reading few comments or reviews.."
1,Not what I expected,"It tells me something about how to run a linux enviroment, but not how to use linux to do any productive work. Acturally, we don't need this heavy book to get linux running. I don't even know when I will refer to this book."
4,"Not perfect, perhaps not pretty, but useful.","I purchased the book, read most of parts I & II andinstalled Linux on my PC using the CD ROM included. I had few problemsinstalling Red Hat Linux - Oracle 8i for Linux is another story... I agree that this book and Linux for that matter are not necessarily for nontechies. I am a techie with a background in programming, but a Linux newbie. I think some of the other reviewers need to lighten up. For this price I received a Linux distribution and more than enough information to get it installed and running. I am using the rest of the book as a reference for setting up services such as Samba file sharing and recompiling the kernel to accomodate Oracle's requirements."
3,"fair coverage, not well organized","I was rather disappointed by this book. It covers a lot of ground, and no doubt there is much in it of help to newbies and Linux vets alike. But the organization of the book is disconcerting, and in many places not even consistent with 6.0 release. The installation section was an utter mess. If you are new to Linux, I recommend buying the book, with the caveat that (although dated) the _Using Linux_ 4th edition book by Que is a much clearer, more concise, and generally more helpful book on Linux general issues."
1,Infuriating and useless.,"There is very little that I can say about this book that is good. Hard content is extremely sparse. There was not one case that I could find where it answered a question I had. When things go wrong with RPM, NFS, samba, etc. it would be wise not to rely on it -- even though there are whole chapters on each of these they are full of poor writing style and vague content. Some chapters are less than 10 pages long despite whole books having been written about the subject. There is nothing ""unleashed"" about this doorstop. Try Mark Sobell's book instead, it's 1000x more valuable, and it's the same price."
5,This book is excellent!!!! Not recommended for a beginner,"This book is the truth! Very good reference book for the Linux administrator that interacts with networks, filesystems, etc."
3,Problem with listing for ipchains,"I wanted to make a secure firewall for my Linux internet server, but couldn't make listing 17.2 in this book work. I am fairly certain that there are errors in the listing. I emailed the publisher with no success. They did not have a clue and said so. I emailed the authors with no success either. They did not reply or could not help. I hope that other parts of the book are accurate, but my experience indicates otherwise. If there are indeed errors they should be posted on the internet."
2,Beware Support,"The support from Motu is quite simply horrible. Returned unit Dec 17th after waiting for a return authorization. Gave them a credit card number for a factory refurbished replacement and now told to wait ""until a unit becomes available"". Good product but buy two for when one goes bad, or, bettr still got to Presonus, M-audio or Tascam."
5,Danzig breaking away from Rick Rubin's grasp,"I have been a follower of Glenn Danzig for many years (Misfits, Samhain) and if you have a open mind on his music (not all of his stuff sounds like ""Mother"") you will be overly impressed with this output. My favorites are ""Bringer of Death"" and ""Brand New God"". Glenn seems to break from Rick Rubins AC/DC style production and give us a taste of his future sound in ""Cantspeak"". Great record."
4,4 for 4,"It's hard to beat Danzig's first three records, but this one stands right up there with 'em. The slide into mediocrity doesn't begin until Blackacidevil."
5,RAW ENERGY,"This was the album that brought alot of early DANZIG fans back to the fold & yet there were others that disliked it due only to the fact that a couple of songs had electronic boosting. DANZIG 4p is a perfect follow up to the THRALL- DEMONSWEATLIVE EP. This album is another punch in the gut & kick in the head from DANZIG & the last to feature the original line up. My favorite tracks are GOING DOWN TO DIE, UNTIL YOU CALL ON THE DARK, BRINGER OF DEATH & INVOCATION (INVOCATION is the name of track 66). Pure raw energy captured in a musical form. Excellent!"
5,THE LAST DANZIG ALBUM BEFORE HE STARTED TO SUCKED!!,THAT SIMPLE!!4 is how ever more like the first album! and is prob tied to the first as being my fave!!YOU WILL NEVER HEAR MUSIC THIS DEPRESSING AGAIN!! THIS IS NOT DOOM METAL..BUT THESE SONG's MANAGE TO MAKE DOOM SOUND HAPPY!!

4,Cute little book that keeps toddlers coming back for more - a review of Barney's Farm Animals,"This sturdy little boardbook has been handed down through three families and 6 children and still looks good. In it there are the usual farm animals (cat, dog, duck, cow, rooster, hen and chicks, goat, pig, horse, sheep) plus an owl (and a frog and bee if you look closely).The drawings are colorful and smaller pages are easy for little folk to turn. Definitely a good educational purchase.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews"
4,Informative and personal,"Come Back, Barbara was suggested to me by my Christian therapist I was seeing in relationship to my daughter, who has been estranged from our family. It gave me a bird's eye view of a solid Christian family who also had a problem...not knowing the thing to do to show love to their daughter even when she seemed unlovable. It helped me to see that anyone with good intentions in raising their children can still lack what is needed in embracing even that which is hard to do. But Jesus tells us that to love the hardest to love is what we need to do and put our own thoughts aside. It was wonderful and I highly suggest it to any parent with a child who seems to not 'fit the mold'. Keep loving your child."
5,"Wow, thank you Miller's","Every parent should read this book! John and Barbara Miller share a shockingly honest story of friendship, parenting and believing for God's miraculous help for raising children with love, compassion and a good dose of reality."
5,Worth it!,"If time equals money then this book will more than pay for itself by saving you time.This book covers a myriad of different topics but it is all ""good stuff."" Flash MX has a few quirks which make it slightly more a programmer's tool (sorry designers) but this book steps through many of those items in an understandable manner. Inside MX is a great resource for the beginner and the intermediate designer/developer, there is enough here to make you say ""Huh, that is cool, never thought of doing it that way."" One benefit of this book is that it actually has some good code in it that is practical for you to rip and use in other places, other books try but often fail, not Inside MX. Having completed the Flash 5 Developer certification and seen some information on the MX Developer certification I can say that this book will be a GOOD reference to review for this exam. This book and the OOP ActionScript book out in Sept. (ISBN: 0735711836) will be a good combination."
4,One for your Flash Library,"If you work with Flash as an illustrator, interface designer, animator, and/or developer, this book belongs on the shelf. The number of Flash books on the market is overwhelming. Is this the only book you should have? No, of course not. But it should be part of your collections and a great place to start. The author covers every aspect of Flash MX, beyond the general regurgitation of the help materials that ship with Flash MX. Along with ActionScript: The Definitive Guide by Moock and Grossman, this is a great companion to have handy while you design and develop with MX."
5,Really a great resource,"I couldn't disagree with the below review more. If speaking to the reader in direct, clear English is a fault, I'd like to find more writers with the same problem. I found this book immensely useful in moving my Flash skills forward. No, it's not for beginners - but it doesn't claim to be either. Does it cover every single Flash topic? Of course not. No book does. But what this book does cover, it covers exceedingly well. Would I like even more information? Sure - do you think they'd consider publishing a second volume? I'll be first in line to buy it."
2,Wants too much,"treats the user sometimes like a child,disgresses with useless examples from the subject and then explains them even not exactly,important ActionScript items are absent,the ""quick reference"" is insufficient and inaccessible,short: as an introduction too bad, as a working help useless."
4,I love veggie tales,"I collect as many of the veggie tale movies as I can. This was a great product that was used but, in good condition. I highly recommend this sealer."
4,It's an entertaining education of morals and values.,"I have five children, ages 9-2, and they were all mesmorized! We have had many discussions on forgiveness since, and now we can't get that crazy ""We are the Grapes of Wrath"" song out of our heads!"
3,Why is this thought of as one of the better ones?,"I have seen every episode of Veggietales, and let me tell you, this is my personal least favoriet. It is barely entertaining. And what's worse is that theres 2 films that are 1/2 the length of the standard one, all about forgiveness. 1/2 an hour of ""I'll forgive you."" It's a very good message, but it's boring. As for the silly song, well it doesn't have Larry, it's about a commercialized Forgive-a-matic, which you press a button to forgive you sins. But all you need to do is ask God, a charectar says. WE UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE. We couldn't agree with Phil Vischier more that this is an excellent moral, but he pounds it into our heads. Every second of the show, minus the main titles is about forgiveness, but it's so much I forgive you that children might get bored. Maybe this film HAD to be made. It's is a good moral, but a very boring tape. I forgive them."
2,The nadir of Veggiedom,This disappointing video suffers both from the comparatively crude animation and slow pacing of the early VeggieTales work and from two boring stories. My children reach for this VeggieTales video far less than they reach for any of the others in our collection.
4,Lots of Fun!,"The VeggieTales tapes are great! This particuar tape is fun, but it isn't the best of the series. It has a very good message and is an easy way to begin instilling the Christian values that have been missing in entertainment."
4,"very good, one little critique","This is a very good early VeggieTales. They didn't quite hit their peak yet with this one. They do 2 segments instead of one larger segment. In between there is no song, but the Forgive-o-matic section is still good. It's just no Silly Song.This is a very good lesson for kids. When someone asks for forgiveness, give it to them. I would note only one thing. A person who is truly sorry will do more than say he or she is sorry. That isn't mentioned in the video, but I also think it is an oversight. However, I have to keep in mind that it is geared towards kids. Big Idea is trying to get the general message across, which they do very well. The parents need to be around to make sure the message in their head doesn't become one of cheap grace. We don't want our kids coming up to us asking forgiveness when all they really want is to get out of trouble and they genuinely aren't sorry. But, as I said, this is more of a note than a critique. I highly recommend the video."
2,"information yes, style no","The information in this book is interesting and explains alot about Suger and his context. However, the style of the book is excessively chatty--often to the point of being off-putting. It was a struggle to get to the last page."
3,Noisy Fan,"My office manager has this fan, and it is whisper quiet on low and high settings. The first one I received made so much noise I returned it for a replacement. The replacement is also noisy on high, but I was too frustrated to return it again. It must be inconsistent quality control by the manufacturer."
4,Get this if you're a big fan,"Make sure to get all of Box Set's other albums first, but if you are a big fan, you should own this as well."
4,Purchased as a gift,"My seven-year-old niece received a karaoke machine for Christmas, and she has been singing with this CD ever since. I think she is quite happy with it."
2,Text now outdated...and many typos throughout!,"This book was published as the CS was being updated so do yourself a favor and buy a different book...this one still deals with outdated scores, for example the SCZI, known now as the PTI. Also scores such as GHR, PHR, WDA% and XA% are nowhere to be found. Until Wiley updates this into a 2nd edition, stay away!Steve"
1,Stick with the Exner and colleagues series,"I have read and used a number of Rorschach scoring and interpretive guides and I feel that the pedagogical value of this book is on par with it's monetary value. As other reviewers have commented, this text is out of date. I also noticed that the case example towards the end is wrought with scoring errors. I purchased this as a brief guide for students in clinical placements, but I am now sure it is better that I summarize the contents of the Exner series for them. I don't recommend this text for anyone who actually uses the test."
2,There are better books on the subject,"The main disadvantage of the book is that it does not do what it actually ""promises"". In order to learn the technique of scoring and interpretation you are constantly referred to Exner's books. Without any of his books on the comprehensive system the book is useless ;-( So it may be a better idea to get the ""real thing"" (i.e. Exner's handbooks or the workbook).A bit disappointing."
5,Perfect!,"This is exactly what I wanted. It is easy to use and clean, accurate, takes up little counter space and does everything I need (afterall, I'm weighing portions not freight). Simple, functional, and value priced. A very good buy."
5,Small and Cheap but Big on Usefulness,"I have been using spark people to manage my weight with success, and decided that it was time to purchase a food scale to be more accurate with my calorie counting. I'd never weighed food before, and wanted something inexpensive to start with. This little scale is just perfect and I doubt I will be upgrading any time soon.It comes with a bowl-shaped top that is removable, and it is easy to put a plate or your own container on top, adjust for the different weight, and measure food that way, as well which is a great feature.It has been very helpful, and is VERY accurate - if all you want is something to weigh food, why pay more?"
3,IT GETS THE JOB DONE!,"It will get the job done. It is a great design, and doesnt take up a lot of space on the counter or cupboard. It is nice because it has removable bowl that is machine washable.The dial on it is flimsy, and you have to recalibrate it before each use, which is super easy. The bad thing is that you have to look from the exact angle that you recalibraated it at because if you walk away and come back,m or even stand up or down a little it will give you a false measurement. It will get the job done if you are a patient person, if not then this isnt for you and I would recommend you get a digital scale."
4,Handy Scale,I love this little guy! Does just what it's supposed to do and take's up very little space. Great price as well.
5,The ultimate $6 scale,"I wasn't expecting much but this little scale has performed perfectly in helping us weigh and measure everything on our diet. The unit is very small and seems to be very accurate. It can only weigh up to 1 pound, but for quick and small measurements there's really nothing better. The measurement bucket detaches and washes easily."
4,A fine little scale,"I bought this scale when I started counting calories. It helps me be more aware of portion size. It is especially helpful when I am not working from a recipe. It is not as precise as a digital scale, but it is also much less expensive. It seems like it would work best when cooking for only 1 or 2 people since the bowl at the top is not that big. Since it is small enough to live on my counter top, I use it much more frequently than my larger kitchen helpers that live out of sight."
2,"Food scale, not ""diet"" scale","Unless you plan to measure out what you eat 6-7 oz at a time, this isn't for you. Great food scale though, its simple and accurate.I guess a digital scale would work better for dieters/bodybuilders"
2,"timely delivery, un- stable product","The dial on this scale is not very sturdy and the overall product seems very delicate to use. I dont trust it to be accurate as it gives different amounts when redone with same weight. However, I must say, The seller is prompt and the product was delivered right away."
2,This is not a childproof scale!,"I purchased this scale so I could weigh my food portions and my husband's. I was quite happy (like other reviewers) with its price, size and functionality until my 2 year old handled it. Within moments she had removed the cardstock placard (where you read the ounces and grams)and plastic cover. It was impossible to replace the card and plastic cover and rely on the scale anymore. Now that I have had this scale, I realize children's fascination with such a kitchen tool. If you have young children, I would invest one of the more expensive scales that cannot be taken apart easily. My 4-year old's friends were also very curious about it and wanted to touch/play with it all the time."
4,Cool but one problem,"A very nice and useful and cost-effective scale. The only thing I don't like is that the numbers part is curved, so looking at it from different directions changes where the thing is pointing."
4,"It's small, but it works","This little guy is exactly what I wanted. Right after the 5 second assembly I measured out some almonds and veggies. There is a small dial to recalibrate which worked as intended. The measurements go up to 500g or slightly over 1 lb. The little white measuring bowl has a convenient spout on the corner.My wife accidentally washed the bowl in the dishwasher behind my back and she used the steam heat to dry. I didn't read any directions because this thing is truly self-explanatory, but don't expose it to high heat. My bowl warped slightly but it wasn't enough to harm the functioning AT ALL. The price is right, you get what you pay for."
4,Great for the price!,"So, this is a great product considering the price. The cup/bowl that sits on top can actually hold the weigher/base inside it for easy storage. Not that you need to really store it since it's so compact to begin with. The cup is easily washable and the dial can be zeroed easily as well. It is not the scale to buy if youre looking to measure exact grams but if youre more interested in grams in 10's then this is for you! It also measures by ounce (lines for every half ounce) but I primarily use the gram function. Definitely not a product for long term or exact measurement but those items won't be cheaper than $30 so again, this is the perfect product for the money!"
5,Food Scale fantastic,The The Polder 77-90 food scale is terrric and a great buy. sure helps me on my diet.
1,Off The Beaten Path But Not All There,"I have used several of ""The Off The Beaten Path"" books over the years and have found them for the most part to be accurate. However, I was greatly dissapointed in the Vermont one. I tried for hours to find several locations only to be told by the ""locals"" that there was no such place or that the structure had been moved several years ago. Some locations were found right off but I found that I have been spoiled but the authors of the New Hampshire book and their accuracy. I have noted that the Rogers are doing the updates. GREAT, now I'll find the places I want to see."
4,Just a genious,"Lito Vitale has bring us some of the best melodies that i have heard in 30 years. This CD contains his very well know ""Ese amigo del alma"" for Lyle Mays and belive me when i tell you that the melody is incredible. His is not only a great composer but a very good player. And his improvisations are really good. Its even better to heard his music live: dont miss his concerts.His CD with the Quartet are incredible, and his colaborations...So, start with this CD and dont miss ""La senda infinita"", ""La Excusa"", ..."
4,Track Listing,"DRUMS OF MALI - performed by the Rhythms Of MaliAmbetasoSoukouni Naka DonkMbe Mousso MimfeNgiguiDunya Ngigui Mounde KeraBoloko DounouMandinka DounouSiramoriRecorded in Bamako, Mali, West Africa."
2,Not as interesting as the 'English' version,"My son received this as a gift, and I thought since he liked the 'English' version he would like this one. He didnt seem to take to it as much. The music isnt as interesting and the songs are shorter. There aren't as many options for him. And on a personal level, the Spanish was Castellano with doesnt really help when most of us in the U.S. speak Espanol from the Americas. I think that they should make a version for the children that will be using it here on this Continent."
2,A little disappointed,"I was disappointed with this toy. I felt a little misled when I read the discription because I thought it would come with the song, ""Wheels on the Bus"" in Spanish. Instead, there is a song which we were not familar. It is not a favorite of my daughter, nor any of her friends who visit."
2,550 degree oven thermometer,The thermometer works great. It is hard for me to read the temp when it is inside my oven. Love the hanger for attaching it to the oven rack. My only complaint is the size of numbers indicating the temp. James Allison
1,Don't buy...,"This came with the paper (?) inside the thermometer with all the numbers not properly aligned, i.e. it was crooked.I threw the thermometer away when I couldn't figure out how to align it. Come on Polder you can do better."
3,Functional but slow,"It does work - it will eventually indicate the temp of your oven. But in my case it takes some 20 minutes for it to stabilize at the temperature. I tested against several other thermocouples.Useful to check if your oven dial is correct, but that's about it.Worth the $5 I paid."
4,Good Product,"Good Product, however the numbers are a little small for my old eyes. Dial colors hold up well, however the needle is no longer red, turned dark over time."
1,Made in China? Run.,"Given that I was in the market for a new oven thermometer, and given that the reviews of most of the available thermometers were less than encouraging, I decided to buy both a Polder and an MIU and test them against a Taylor mercury thermometer.Right off the bat, the MIU was off by 25 degrees. The Polder was dead on. However, within one day, the Polder was off by 40 degrees. But since they were so cheap, they're not worth returning.Moral? Save your money and buy a mercury oven thermometer on eBay. They generally go for less than ten dollars and there's no guesswork involved as to their accuracy."
2,Doesn't stand up to the competition,"I suppose I can't expect the world from a $6 thermometer but it doesn't seem to be able to stand up with even the slightest nudge on the RACK (not the therm). Quite the problem unless you have the feather touch taking pans in and out of the oven. Not to have all my hopes dashed, it does tell pretty accurate temp when it is upright. The hanging tab works great if you have the room to hang it, not an option for me since I often use the bottom rack. If polder beefed up the bottom stand or added some counter weight, this would be a good little thermometer. Until then, keep your long handled tongs handy to pick it up off of the element."
5,Works as expected,"I didn't think my oven temperature adjustment was working so I bought this to test it. It proved my oven only had one setting ""burn"". I can't comment on how accurate the thermometer is but it did everything I was expecting it to."
4,Kitchen Necessity,"Stop wondering why your cakes burn or take too long to bake. Buy an inexpensive Polder oven thermometer. It will last for years, and will take the guesswork out of baking."
4,"Useful, but not quite the best.","Few books about World War I have anything like adequate maps, making an atlas indispensible as a supplement. This it not quite the best overall atlas for most purposes -- for that I nominateThe Viking atlas of World War I-- but it good overall. The maps are all stark black-on-white and can require a quite a great deal of study to interpret.There's quite a lot of material not only on geography but on various pieces of equipment and on details of air operations.One regrettable lapse that it shares with virtually all such books is lack of any source references for its data. Since it differs with some other books on some important pieces of information, this is frustrating."
3,A Military Atlas of the First World War,"I enjoy following non-fiction military history, in this case WWI, bookswith maps to follow the line of battle. This Atlas is very good forreviewing the action.Chris E Columbus"
1,not convenient,"Yes, I can hear the alarm in most rooms of the house - but I can hear the timer on my microwave just as well. This timer is poorly designed. The magnet on the back is attached to the clip that juts out from the back of the timer and is not balanced - so whenever I want to press a button I have to stabilize the unit with my other hand or it goes flying off of the refridgerator or scooting across the stove. Another complaint is that once the timer has rung, if I don't clear it by pressing the minute and second button at the same time while holding the timer stable, it starts all over. I have to press for each minute of cooking time I want, and I would prefer to have an hour button than a second button. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Passes the Soup Pot Submersion Test,"Cons: Poorly designed spring clip and weak magnet on back makes unit unstable. Only one function-countdown. Other models for about [money] will do everything but take out the garbage.Pros: Loud alarm. Large display. Long battery life (2+ years) even though display is always on.Durability: I once knocked the timer into a hot pot of cream of butternut squash soup! Fished it out with a ladle; took out the battery; unscrewed the case; rinsed it well in warm water; then turned the blow drier on it (hey, what've I got to lose?). Two hard working months later it's still as good as new."
3,Very basic and very loud,"As a countdown timer, it works OK but is extremely loud. Setting it for ten minutes requires ten very loud beeps. It has NO other functions, unlike most timers. But for what it is (and it isn't much) it works OK."
3,too noisy,"I like that this operates with a AAA battery - I usually have some around for the TV remote. I do not like that it beeps LOUDLY for each time you push the buttons to set the time: e.g. set for 45 minutes, you hear 45 beeps."
4,Women and Poetry--does it get any better than this?,"This is an excellent collection of women poets in America. From classic feminist poets like Anne Sexton to beat poet Diane di Prima, this collection covers almost everyone who's anyone in 20th century women's poetry. One of the things I wish of this collection, however, is more late 20th century poets. While many of the poems included are from the latter part of the century, there are no poets featured who were born after 1960. As a young woman poet, I find it difficult to find women similar to myself in such an all-encompassing collection of women's poetry. I'd like to know who's publishing poetry now.I think my favorite poem in this collection is ""Why, Some of My Best Friends are Women"" by Phyllis McGinley. It's a wonderful study of what women are versus what they are percieved to be by society."
2,depressing,"saw maybe 7 poems out of 300? I enjoyed. Don't mind the women's lib attitude or the suffering it was just depressing, boring and a waste of book space. ( poems I enjoyed were by louis gluck robin morgan mona van guy wendolyn books susan griffin carolyn kizer)"
2,"Great, but...","Holmes HPF650-U 18-Inch Outdoor Patio Oscillating 3-Speed Stand FanAs far as providing a cool breeze for our patio, the product works great! BUT, the fan began to rust after only two days on my patio. Three calls to the manufacturer and a contentious confrontation with the seller has failed to provide any solution to the problem."
5,Perfect replacement!,"I have an '05 Honda Civic Hybrid and this was a direct replacement.No auto parts store stocked this filter and the Honda dealer wanted $37+tax for the Honda version.The Honda version appears more like an K&N; filter, not sure about the oil, but the material, color, etc remind me of it. This filter is just white paper. For the price difference I can replace 3 of these to 1 Honda, so I am not worried about it at all.MPG went back up after replacing the very dirty filter in the car."
2,Great in the beginning...wait a few years,"I bought my Scanpan set 10 years ago. I love it when it's new. It cooks evenly and it's truly non-stick. My issue is that after about three years of normal cooking, the ceramic coating starts to bubble and flake off. I now have to send this back to them on my dime for replacement. To me, a lifetime guarantee means I shouldn't have to keep doing this.I have recently replaced my entire set of cookware with another non-stick set. I bought a few pieces of the other non-stick three years ago at the same time I sent several Scanpan pieces in for warranty replacement (again). The other/new set of cookware is going strong and is not in need of replacement. My scanpan is now a very expensive, though nice, set of camping cookware.For the record, I hand wash my cookware, I don't use non-stick sprays, I only use nylon/plastic or bamboo utensils, and I never use high heat. The long-term performance of this cookware is unacceptable."
4,Pretty Good...,"Overall I really enjoy this little product. I floss much more often since I have gotten in. My main complaint is the design of the handle. Some of my teeth are very close together and the location of the hand grip (rather far back on the handle) combined with the springiness of the neck makes it difficult to floss in between tight teeth. It can be done, but if the grip was a little closer to the floss end and the neck not quite so flexible it would be much easier.The only other complaint I have is the price of replacement floss heads. They are almost $3 for 28 at my local store. That's $3 in floss a month. Much more than using normal dental floss. But this has got me in the habit of flossing daily, so for me it's well worth the extra cost.Bottom line though, great product!"
5,2004 Dodge ram,"He still does work really well I never really have any issues with them and last about 60,000 miles it's not pretty dusty Ryanbrook is a lot of salt"
3,patrick beanie baby,What can you say? It's a cute little toy that has survived life attached to a busy book bag and also survived a curious dog. It has no educational value but why should it?
4,TV remote operation made easy,Lighted magnifying glass takes the fumbling and frustration away from operating a TV remote in a darkened room.
3,Good deal,"It is very stable to cut stuff on it. However, I was not able to attach the knife stand because the screw hole was not matching."
4,"Small Cart, Big Work Space","I'm very happy with this cart. Although small in scale, it provides much needed counter-height work space in a cramped kitchen. The granite insert is very heavy but handsome looking. I also appreciate the drawer for covered storage as well as the open shelves.It was easy to assemble, although 2 non-essential screws were missing and I have contacted the manufacturer for replacements.My cart sustained supperficial damage after a ""helpful"" neighbor hauled the heavy cart upstairs by himself. The cart as shipped is nearly 70lbs; following the manufacturer's suggested 2 person hauling method (clearly marked on the outside of the crate) is recommended."
3,In AA,If you're in AA or NA or another 12-Step program then it's okay but if not I can't really see how you'd get full benefit from this text.
2,Interesting stuff clouded by prejudice,"Kasl does a good job of painting a broad picture which posits the pathway to spiritual enlightenment is broad and that there arwe many roads that can get us there. Unfortuantely, too often she falls back on that pseudo-intellectual - new agey - warrior princess stuff that died out in the early 90s.Her critique of AA and 12 step methodology is spot on in places, although she fails to acknowledge the diverse ways the 'program' is practiced by its membership. Furthermore, issues of dogma, power and control are just as prevelant in feminist organizations as in AA. One senses she's a bit blinded by her own loyalty to her postion.Ultimately, its the excess of that 60s-postmodernist-femist tripe that kinda swamps the good parts of her message. Definiately written for a different era. Not sure how relevant it is to recovery/spiritual development these days.."
3,White liles island...?,"Being a big Natalie Imbruglia's fan, I can't reject her work but knowing her ability for music and after the great work she did in her debut album 'Left of the middle', I would say that 'White liles... is pretty depressing and boring, though it's in the same line that her first work.Her music style is basically the same but what this album doesn't have ,and that 'Left of the middle' did, is VARIATION. The 11 songs, except Sunlight, just sound like one long song that you only want to hear when you feel blue.In short, it is a regular (good enaugh) Cd, that even her soft and sweet voice and her personal touch can't make any better. Plus after being 3 years waiting for her new job, I was expecting much more from her and her staff.Anyway, I'd give 6,5/10 to it because of her musical improvement and because it's ideal as background music for a quiet party or dinner."
5,a beautiful island...,"This album is simply amazing for a sophmore work. Imbruglia's song-writing skills are among the most promising I've ever seen; best shown with Talk In Tongues, That Day, and Butterflies. The melodies and music are simply beautiful and Imbruglia's voice is one of the prettiest in the history of popular music. When this album was originally released Amazon had a wonderful review until it was replaced by the 'sophmore slump' currently abiding. After nearly two years I've worn the album down though I still consider it among my few favorites ever and certainly the best of 2002."
5,Another great album from a great musician,"After buying Left Of the Middle when it was first released, I bought this album expecting a good album but not as good as LOTM. I was totally wrong. This album blew me away, and in my opinion is better that her previous album. The album contains catchy songs, good music, great vocals with a big range and meaningful lyrics, unlike most pop around at the moment. Natalie took a while to release this album but it's well worth the wait, you can really tell that she put a lot of herself into the production of this record, it has a certain personal quality but also appeals to the masses. Overall, a great album to kick off 2002. Highlights include 'Everything Goes', 'Satellite', 'Come September' and her singles 'That Day' and 'Wrong Impression'."
3,"Disappointed: Better Singing, But Less Attitude","The most striking thing about this CD is that her singingstyle sounds very different to me compared to ""Left of the Middle.""I was a definite fan of her first CD, with songs like ""Torn"",""One More Addiction"", ""Big Mistake"", ""Leave Me Alone"",and ""Wishing I Were There"", in which her voice sounded sexy, raw and a little bit mean.On ""White Lilies Island"", her voice sounds more polishedand dare I say, happy? Her singing is more impressive, buton the same token, she sounds more like a regular pop singer.Overall, I found the songs on the album to be somewhatboring.There are some definitely good songs on this CD. My favoritesare ""This Day"", ""Satellite"", and ""Wrong Impression"", but Iwonder what happened to that sexy, raw, and little bit meanNatalie I knew before. It seems she'smatured into a singer who's technically better, but also lessinteresting."
5,Natalie- No longer known as a one hit wonder,"When I heard Natalie Imbruglia's new song ""Wrong Impression"", I knew I had to buy the CD. I love her song ""Torn"" also from her debut album. I have the CD now and I am so glad I got it. There is not one bad song on the album, I love them all. I will never get sick of listening to it. I hope this CD will be more promoted than her last CD and that she will have more singles. It needs more recognition. I highly recommend this CD. It was well worth the [money]!"
5,Quite amazing,"I really like this album. It's hard to explain, but just everything about it is so excellent and enjoyable to me. She co-wrote all of the 12 songs on the disc. It gets off to a good start with the frantic and somewhat neurotic ""That Day"". A nice egdy song. ""Wrong Impression"" is very memorable and catchy, a nice hit. Her songwriting definately has substance and meaning, she has an emotional connection to the music. I quite like ""Beauty on the Fire"" which may be my favorite song on the disc. ""Satellite"" and ""Do You Love"" are also fabulous. ""Sunlight"" is another excellent edgy song that soars. ""Goodbye"" and ""Butterflies"" are excellent ballads. I can't say enough about this album, but it blew me away, and it still does!"
3,Copy-protected!! CD-ROM Trouble!!!!,"A likable and entertaining new album, full of nice songs. I am a big fan of Natalie.But I had to bring the CD back, because I couldn't play the darn thing on my PC CD-ROM, which I use the most. Only my Home CD-Player would let me listen to the album. Very frustrating! Brought the CD back. Got my money back. Too bad.So, when you want to listen to the album with a CD-ROM Drive, be prepared for possible problems. It only plays in a standard Music CD Player. And not even that is for sure."
3,BEAUTY ON FIRE,"Natalie's sophomore album was no slump in an artistic way. It's understandable that music has move to a more pop friendly arena, by the time Natalie's second effort came to life. But I cannot get how can a superb single like THAT DAY got overlooked, the melancolic state and the outstanding performance of miss Imbruglia in the track is just delicious. WRONG IMPRESSION, okay here's where the problem began. How do you spect people in the US to like a clon of her classic TORN, it is a total marketing mess to try to promote Torn Pt. II as the first single of a more mature soft rock album. Don't get me wrong, this tune is fine but not her best joint in the LP. BEAUTY ON FIRE her last international single, is more mature and hot rock track. Summing all up, WHITE LILIES ISLAND is a more mature and clever delivery from beautiful childish voice Natalie, it is sad that radio or label failed to promoted well."
3,Good...but!,"Natalie is definitly going to be with us for awhile, however, I would say that this album is but a srepping stone.Though many songs are good, there are none that stand out. None have a hook! Moreover, the selections tend to show the immaturity in Natalie's voice. Maturity will come with time and this album shows that she isn't there yet! It also indicates that she is on her way."
5,sophomore slump?,"I was wondering where Natalie Imbruglia went after hearing her single, Torn, die out on the radiowaves. Well, she's back and better than ever. Why was White Lilies Island released to the US so late? It's an amazing album that really shows Natalie Imbruglias true talent. My favorite song being Beauty on the Fire. Definite buy."
5,Natalie's Newest and Best,"It has been three years since Natalie has been on the scene, but her new album is definately better than the first. Each song is filled with many inspiring thoughts and emotions. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Natalie or has never heard anything from Natalie. A must for any music collection."
5,Really Superb Follow-up,"Simply stated, this album is incredible from first song to last. Natalie's growth and maturity over the past 4 years is almost unbelievable. Her style is better and her voice is quite honestly 5 times better and stronger than Left of the Middle. Much of the vocal work on LOTM, although good, sounded strained and throaty. Her vocals now sound extremely pure and forceful, as though she is in complete command of her craft. The guitar-work is also exceptional.It took a few listens of this CD to begin to appreciate it for what it is. I had expected something a little harder, more along the lines of a lot of the tunes on Left of the Middle, but the catchy melodies and the heart-felt emotion of the songs on WLI very quickly win you over, even if it wasn't what you initially expected.This is quite possibly album of the year and is a must for any good music collection. Buy this CD, no matter who you are. You won't regret it."
3,"Turned a little county, but...","I loved Natalie's album, ""Left Of The Middle,"" but this one's a little different. I like it, but her music and voice seems to have turned a little country-like, and that's okay if you like country. Unfortuanatly, I'm not really that fond of it. I think the more I listen to it, I'll like it, but some of the songs on this album are slower and have a little twang in 'em. I do like the songs ""That Day,"" ""Satellite,"" and ""Sunlight."" This is a good album, but I don't think it's as good as her previous one."
2,zzzzzzzzzz,"If you liked her last one you won't like this one much. Musically it still expresses great talent but the album as a whole lacks diversity and has too many slow songs. It does not have the edge that gave her a rock/pop label. ""Satellite"" and ""Wrong Impression"" are the best songs on the album and compare more to her previous work. A good album if you are going to sleep but not much for in the car listening."
2,disappointment,Left of the Middle was one of my all-time fav sound trcks and I was very excited when I found out that natalie had a new CD out. I quickly went to get it but was very disappionted to realize that it was no where near as good as her last CD.
2,"I was disappointed, but the album isn't bad","When I heard that Natalie Imbruglia had put out a new album, I was really excited. I couldn't wait to buy it. I finally got it and I listened to it and I was expecting that same spunk and attitude from ""Left of the Middle."" It's a very beautiful album, but not the same. It's going to have to grow on me I think.It's worth buying, but I still think ""Left of the Middle"" is better."
1,Won't Play,"Appears to be copy protected. It won't work on my XBox, which I use as both CD and DVD Player. It plays the first few seconds of track one then my speakers crackle and then it just repeats those few seconds over and over again. Big fan of Natalie Imbruglia but haven't been able to actually listen to the CD yet."
1,Not an Audio CD!,"This CD is ""copy protected"" by the Cactus Data Shield. It doesn't conform to the CD-Digital Audio standard, and is not an Audio CD. For me, it was unlistenable on my computers AND my discman; listening to it on a friends machine, it sounded good, but I returned it as defective. Very disappointing."
2,Tina's allergic to White Lilies!,"Yup! There has been a rumour that Natalie Imbruglia's ""White Lilies Island"" had been named after a flower that her rival Tina Arena is completely allergic to. Fact is, it's her newly bought home in England. Lavish Natalie! Anyway, Nat's sophomore offering is not at par with her debut album ""Left Of The Middle"", no powerful alternatives like ""Torn"" or ""Smoke"" just plain, and boring handicrafts from Natalie's group of dragging songwriters and composers. She co-wrote some of the songs and there are only 2 standouts, ""Wrong Impression"" and ""Beauty On The Fire"". Good thing, these two had been released as a single but never gave justice to the slow and minimal success of ""White Lilies Island"". She even got sued by her record company for not generating hit singles off the album! 2 stars here, one for her beauty and one for the effort, Get Tina Arena's ""Just Me"" instead. Now ""Just Me"" is a great album!"
1,Beware copy protected CD,"What's this CD like? I haven't a clue. It seems to be copy protected and won't play in any of my computer CD-ROM drives or my DVD player. On the back of the CD cover it says ""Cactus Data Shield 200 by Courtesy of Midbar Tech LTD, Tel-Aviv, Israel""."
5,Beautiful Heartfelt Classic,"This quiet splash of an album has to be one of the most beloved cd's in my collection. Every song is addictive, beautiful, and dreamlike. It saddens me to see such a classic belittled by critics. Can they not hear the sheer exuberance of ""That Day""? Can they not understand the simplistic genius of ""butterflies""?What about ""Come September""? Does this lost classic not make others knees go weak as it does to mine? I highly suggest this purchase for anyone needing a mid day vacation in their car ride home from work. Gorgeous music."
2,Disapointed,"Honestly, I have to say, that this CD saddens me quite a bit. I loved (and still do love) Natalie Imbruglia's first CD Left Of The Middle, and found it much more profound and interesting than White Lilies Island. If I were you, I would buy Left Of The Middle first, because just listening to White Lilies Island, might turn you off of a great artist."
1,Disappointing,"Some of the tracks here are alright, but it lacks a truly radio-worthy pop gem like ""Torn."" Natalie's debut wasn't anything spectacular, but this is horrible. ""Wrong Impression"" is the best track, and it really isn't very good. It's pitiful for a first single when you consider her previous hit. Buy her debut, or, better yet, the ""Torn"" single. She'll never top it."
2,Imbroglio,"A couple confections of Top-40 bliss does not an album make. Yes, each of That Day and Wrong Impression is what a Top-40 song should be: instantly relateable and hummable. Dig a little deeper and what you find is what my dictionary calls an imbroglio - a confused heap. Most of the songs here are tepid exercises in music composition that don't affect the listener. It would seem that Nat, sweet loverly Nat, is destined to produce one or two solid songs every few years. Luckily we can enjoy them on the radio in their 4 minutes of popular glory. I would recommend avoiding the bother of wading through an entire CD."
4,Excellent Energy,"I had only heard the first title of this cd ""Wrong Impression"" and knew I enjoyed her previous singles yet never purchased any of her cd's so I thought I would go with it. I absolutely enjoy this CD ... the songs have so much to say ... you can relate to at least one song since each gives a different meaning/message."
5,Absolutely smashing,"Whe I first heard and saw this on DVd which I value preciously I was just blown away. Not only do they make greta Dance music but the fusion of all these genres make this band one of kind. From one carnal to another, way ta go Poncho. A fan from el Chuco-P. Garcia"
5,super powerful,I admit it...I didnt do my homework before purchasing these binoculars. I just wanted a pair to help me see the hummingbirds at the feeder which is approx 20' from my house. I couldnt adjust these to see that close but when I looked into the woods across the street I could literally see every blade of grass. If I looked at the moon with these I probably could have seen the American flag!!
3,Bad Shipment,"The book is fine but the shipment is terrible. Initially I had chosen normal shipment and it gave me a two week date. I changed it for 2 days shipment and the system gave me a different date, sooner than the normal shipment, but it was mailed based on the first date. Somebody has to review this. I know that 2 days does not necessarily mean two days from purchase, but I paid for premium shipment and it was a waste."
5,Best Lip Balm in the World,"I have used this lip balm for about 7 years and it's hands down the best. I've tried a lot of balms, too! You know that ""lip scum"" we all get? This lip balm actually gets rid of it, I don't know how. And unlike other lip balms that made you have to apply more and more, this lip balm moisturizes your lips in a way that stays longer, so you aren't constantly reapplying it. Lastly, I have a problem with getting itchy irritation from some skin products and this lip balm doesn't irritate my skin at all. Love love love it."
5,Works quite well,"I've had this product for quite some time in my arsenal of lip balms and chapsticks. Can't quite remember where I first scored a tube. I'm always in the market for something good and effective. This lip balm does the trick and I have just placed an order for a second tube <first one 75% gone>. The vanilla scent is subtle and fades a lil' while post-application. It provides great moisturizing properties to my full lips. Kissably soft for your guy ladies. KISSABLY soft (smooch)! There is a bit of sheen to it but it doesn't look or feel greasy -nor have I ever thought it to leave a waxy feel. Winter or summer, no matter, it's great for year round use. I hope my relationship with this product turns out to be lifelong. I say buy-it, try-it, you might <should> like it."
2,Different strokes?,"I feel bad posting a less-than-glowing review for this, since so many people love it, but it just did NOT live up to my expectations. First, this balm is waxy and heavy. Not quite as bad as old-school chapstick, but pretty close. It made my lips feel gummy and almost (but not quite) sticky. I also find the ingredients list questionable, because the vanilla scent (""vanilla extract"" on the label) is very strong and extremely artificial; additionally, I felt a mild stinging with repeat applications. I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, but I've never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla (by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil). This was a dud for me."
5,what you see is what you get,"If you happen to be a fan of Q and the Continuum, if the episodes in which Q appeared are your favourites in any of the Star Trek series, then this collection is right up your alley. It includes all episodes featuring Q--from TNG to DS9 to Voyager.Personally, I always felt (and still feel) that we never got quite enough Q from the Star Trek universe; he's a delicious character (John de Lancie plays him so well), and probably a lot of fun to write. But if, like me, you'll take of Q what you can get, I highly recommend this DVD set.Some episodes in the set have optional extras: commentary written on the lower margin of the screen (but not spoken aloud). If it's been a while since you've seen the episodes, I recommend leaving the commentary off for the first go, as it becomes distracting sometimes (much like audio commentary, really)."
5,A Star Trek Gotta Have!!,"For anyone that is a Star Trek fan, this is a have to own. I can't think of any other Star Trek character that was a ""bad guy"", but you still loved him all the more, except for Harry Mudd from the Original Series. ""Q"" simply makes Star Trek a neat experience, and for anyone that likes Q, you will really enjoy these DVD's. It is a collection of every Star Trek from any franchise that has the character of ""Q"" in it."
2,The most important episode is LEFT OUT!,"What gives? How do you make a collection about Q without including the very first Star Trek Episode that deals with the Q Continuum? That is correct, the first episode about Q did not air on TNG, it aired back in 1967!Episode Title: ""THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS""Production Number: 18Original Air Date: 01-12-67Stardates: 2124.5Trelane has technology to manipulate matter and energy, and has created an Earthlike environment around his castle on the otherwise uninhabitable planet. He holds the Enterprise crew on the planet for his own amusement, until he is confronted by the disembodied voices of his elders, scolding him for his treatment of his new ""pets."" Trelane is sent away, and his elders allow Captain Kirk and the Enterprise crew to continue on their mission to Colony Beta Six.For more validation of this fact, check out this book:Q-Squared (Star Trek: The Next Generation) (Paperback)by Peter David"
2,"Just one look, that's all it took","Late one evening a mysterious woman sings Italian opera underneath the window of Jack Hilliard. He spends the rest of the book trying to find out who she is and where she is. Really, that's all that happens. The locales change to Italy and Monte Carlo. There's hardly any action or adventure. Can't say it was a grand romance seeing as how the two protagonists speak to each other only a handful of times."
5,FANTASTIC! One of the few mysteries I read over and over,"I'm a huge fan of Emma Lathen, and this is probably my favorite book of all. Like all of her books, it is very witty (in some places, downright hilarious), and thoroughly enjoyable. The series features Wall Street bank executive John Putnam Thatcher and his colleagues -- and Wall Street banking was never that interesting when I worked there. Although I usually give away mysteries after reading them, this is one of only two series I keep and reread. I never tire of them."
2,Last Holiday,"Great Movie- a fun story about living a life of no regrets when you think you only have three weeks to live. How would you do things differant? Gorgia Bird decided to live her book of ""Possibilty"" instead of just dreaming about them- I highly recommend this movie."
2,Long And Drawn Out,"""Last Holiday"" has a positive message: Enjoy yourself because life is too short. That's fine, but this movie was just too long and boring and it took me 3 days just to finish watching it. I thought this movie was a comedy but there was nothing funny about it. I enjoyed Queen Latifah more in ""Set It Off"" rather than in this dull film."
1,Blue Ray Problems,This the only Blue Ray disk I have ever purchased that will NOT play on my player. Interesting note from distributer in the box that warns that you might have to upgrade your player software to play the disk. This of course was not mentioned in the purchase line on order forms. Had to go out and buy the regular DVD disk for wife as orginal was supposed to be Christmas present. NOT happy to have to purchase a disk twice to get one that works.D.Smith
5,Queen Latifah... Love her,"A good chic flick.... I like Queen Latifah's movies that are light and fun, such as Bringing Down The House and Beauty Shop"
4,Sweet & fun,Not a big movie for the box office but very entertaining ig you like Queen Latifah! Sweet story that makes you think about what you would do if you had few weeks to live... It would probably not be as funny...
5,Last Holiday,"I watched ""the Last Holiday"" using prime via internet connection.The movie is really good and both funny and encouraging.The internet connection worked very well."
5,Review Last Holiday,Excellent to be able to see this one again.... Excellent service provided by trader. Much appreciated. Will definitely look at obtaining other titles. Cheers :-)
5,Great for the entire family,This movie has a great story line. It's a wonderful comedy for the entire family. A good clean movie. What a find these days!
5,"""LAST HOLIDAY"" REVIEW DVD","This was a great movie. Very believeable. Queen Latifa was wonderful. Comedy, romance, a little predictable and very entertaining without being too serious. I think everyone could picture this happening to them. I ordered the DVD so I can watch it whenever I want. Try it--you'll be glad you did."
5,Good all-around family movie,"Although the movie is set in the Christmas holiday season, it can be enjoyed throughout the year by all members of the family. Beautiful scenes filmed in Europe--makes you want to take a holiday there for yourself."
3,Enjoyable,Queen Latifah is the only descent thing about this film. The story itself felt like a paint by numbers production with no real surprises. Enjoyable...but you should wait for the DVD.
3,An OK movie,"This is an OK movie but a tad long at 112 minutes. It seemed to drag in places, and I think it could have been done in 90 or 95 minutes tops. I don't think it is worth watching a second time. In any event, it was certainly more enjoyable than ""The Bucket List"", a movie with a similar plot."
2,"Movie has nice message, but falls short overall!!","Georgia Byrd (played by Queen Latifah) is a quiet, demure woman who is content to live the single life and working as a cooking demonstration clerk at a department store. She has big dreams of becoming a chef and owning her own restaurant and is secretly in love with a co-worker, but won't purse either possibilty. It isn't Georgia Byrd is misdiagnosed as having several inoperable brain tumors and given three weeks to live, that she decides to quit her job, cash in her bonds, and fly to Europe to live out her life as she had always wanted. In doing this she truly finds out the person she really is.I love the premise of living life to your fullest and not letting your own fears/doubts stop you from pursuing your dreams, but don't like the cheesy plot twist."
2,Product poor quality but company responded well,"I got this video and took it to my brother's to watch with family. Within about 15 minutes the movie would skip ahead about 10 minutes each time, and then we tried to go scenes back and watch and it would work for a few minutes then skip. So disappointing. I bought it in 'very good' condition too. HOwever, the company did amazing with shipping it quickly, and refunding me promptly. They had no replacement unfortunately, and I couldn't get another one. So sad, as it's a really good movie, but they did well, other than the original product."
4,Last Holiday,"Queen Latifah stars in this endearing movie that forces the audience to question their own lives. Queen is told that she only has a few weeks to live, and she finds out that she has to learn a hard lesson about living life instead of waiting for the perfect time for things to happen. While this movie does force the viewer to think about life, there are some very funny moments. LL Cool J was surprisingly good in this film, and the rest of the supporting cast was wonderful."
5,Outstanding feel-good movie,"I saw this movie in Orlando a few weeks ago. You know it's a good movie when the audience applauds 2-3 times during the movie. Great cast. Queen Latifah is her usual cute, funny self. She's also regal in this movie. I had so much fun seeing this movie that I'm going again. Lots of funny stuff. And when the movie ended, I felt that warm feeling of happiness."
3,It's okay but nothing special,"The description for 3 stars says it all - ""It's okay"". It was enjoyable but I don't know if I'll watch it again...maybe I will down the road. It lacked a ""hook"" to make me keep coming back to it again and again."
4,Copy can be better,"I loved the movie and could do without high definition on films like this; but why? I recommend it, Queen is a great actresses and the plot is simple and fulfilling."
5,So Funny!!,"If your in the mood for a very funny feel good enjoyable movie, this is the one to see. Queen Latifah and LL Cool J have perfect onscreen chemistry. All the cast did excellent jobs. And it is good for the whole family. There is only one or two sitatuations of adult humor. This film really does make you think about the things that are important in life. You never know when you are gonna die, so live everyday to its fullest.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
4,"Fun, sweet, silly movie.","Last Holiday was a sweet, heartwarming, and sometimes silly movie that ended up being a lot better than I expected. This is primarily due to Queen Latifah's Georgia and LL Cool J's Sean. They were perfect for their roles, and they were convincing enough in their characters to suck me into the movie. Yes, the plot was a bit too contrived. Yes, some of the scenes were outlandish and made people groan, ""Puleeeeze!"" But in spite of these little bumps, the movie overall was still quite enjoyable. If you're in the mood for something light-hearted, heart-warming, and fun, this is the perfect movie for you!"
4,A good message,"I actually liked this movie, but agree with some that the direction could have been better. Tim Hutton's acting, as always was stellar. He's a very funny guy. Conceptually, the message is a good one...Perfect love casts out all fear. It encourages us to use our God given gifts and talents...and that it's only too late if you are dead. I would see it again."
5,review,We had seen the movie several times and just had to add it to our DVD collection. Funny great actors and amazon delivered it very quickly.....thanks a bunch.Darrell
5,I loved this Movie,"This is an enjoyable film, and fun to watch. Queen Latifah did an excellent job as someone faced with a huge change in life."
4,"Charming, Lovely, Wonderful . . .","Queen Latifah will charm the socks off you as shy cookware department store clerk Georgia Byrd who takes a ""last holiday"" when she discovers she only has three weeks to live. LL Cool J is adorable as fellow employee Sean, with whom she is in love. Your heart just rends for her as she cries at her kitchen table.Having nothing to lose, Georgia heads to beautiful Czechoslovakia to the magificent Versailles-like Grand Pupp Hotel. The head of her department store is there, along with a senator. The department store head is scheming for the senator's help in his business acquisition plans. Soon everyone is falling over this mysterious woman who seems to be a wealthy power player.Last Holiday is actually a movie that men AND women would enjoy, one that has a powerful message of following your dreams."
2,Disappointed,"DVD made in Mexico; does not play in some of my DVD players because it was made in different region. Looks like a pretty good bootleg. Very, very, disappointed."
5,It was great.,"My wife had this movie recommended to her by a friend, and it was as good as we anticipated. Loved Queen Latifah's character. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
1,tried it twice but just couldn't keep it,It looked like a good deal with a nice variety of utensils and an attractive set up. The first set that was delivered came without a bread knife so I grudgingly sent it back and asked for another set. When the return set was delivered it TOO was delivered without a bread knife so at that point I decided to cut my loses (pun intended) and get my money back. It was an attractive knife set and I really could have used it but I have better things to do with my time than to drive to the post office to return packages. I will try another company next time.
3,OK for the price,"The main reason I picked this if for the combination. I like the santoku and partoku knives. Overall the white plastic is pretty cheap looking and is not finished well. You see flash all over the edges whch could have been easily trimed where ever this was manufactured. Besides the not so contemporary design, the knives are good."
4,Chicago Cutlery,"I got a great deal thru Amazon, received the set right away (impressive considering it was in December). Only problem was the bread knife was missing. We called Chcago Cutlery and they are sending one out. I've never cut with a knife so sharp in my life. Love 'em!"
2,Not Good...,"I am displeased with this purchase. The knives dull quickly and rust spots appear after the first use. Plus, steak knives don't even have ""teeth."" Sure, it is a decent price, but I would suggest spending more on a better set."
3,12 Piece Knife Set,"Its okay.. its not the finest in the line you could buy, but the knives are sharp and it beat the heck out of what I was using!"
1,Poor product,"I bought these knives a few years ago, they started developing rust stains soon after i started to use them. They are poorly made from thin steel and not pure stainless."
5,Great knives,"My wife talked me into getting these knives since I do all the cooking in the family. She wanted them because they looked better on our counters than my old set but they are the best set I have ever bought. Sharp edges, wonderful weight, easy to clean, and they do look good on the counter."
3,"Complete Set, but knife handles lacking","This block of knives is pretty complete. It has all the knives a typical kitchen would need. Notably, it has a 7"" santoku and kitchen shears (scissors). The block is also a nice touch. However, the knife handles are a little too short to be holding it comfortably. The material of the plastic white handles have a brushed finish, rather than a polished finish--raising concerns of whether they can stay clean and white over the long run. It was recently on sale for a very low price of $20, so any drawbacks are completely overshadowed by the price."
5,awesome set,I bought this set for my sister-in-law for Christmas. I have a set that I love but no steak knives. My sister-in-law was so excited when she got it she used right away. This set is very very nice and the do last the test of time. I would recommend this product to anyone!
2,Mediocre,There are about 8-10 good/great songs total on this but the rest is TERRIBLE. Lots of unlistenable over-produced 70s garbage. I bought it for Ton of Dynamite alone as I had the other good songs already. I'd listen to it before you buy it.
3,"Hopefully, this is not the best translation....",I believe there are better translations out there. This one was rather plodding.I wish amazon would publish the name of the translator as well as the author right up front for its Kindle editions -- one cannot see who the translator is until one has purchased the book -- at least when buying online here. Very frustrating.
2,Doesn't work,"Did not work for me, after applying on Saturday I was eaten up with Mosquitoes on Monday while trying to grill hamburgers. Would not recommend this product."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"Whatever you do don't buy this product or any other product from the company that makes these mosquito repellent granules! First of all, the granules smell horrible and we had to send them back because of this reason. We hadn't even taken any granules out of the container and it smelled up our whole garage! Also, it took over 2 weeks to ship when it was promised in 3-4 days. Even though the company received the unopened, returned product back we have still yet to get a refund or hear from them (it's been over a month). The company conveniently leaves their phone number off their invoice so that you can't contact them. [...]"
4,Interesting lessons,"Excellent stuff for use as dry sprinkle on the porches for keeping mosquitos away. It was useless against the onslaught of flies, and most other bugs, and I PAINfully found out wasps do NOT like this stuff. I tolerate wasps if they are well behaved, because they eat mosquitos. I got stung the other day because they did not like this product. I was refreshing my front porch with the product and the wasps went nutz.NOTE: once the granules get wet, they seem to be far less effective. This might explain why use in the grass was pointless. Beyond that, I will buy this again, should the buggies be as bad as they have been this year!"
1,Absolutely Useless,"This product is a complete waste of money. IT DOES NOT & WILL NOT WORK. I take care of nearly 100 lawns, and have several years of experience in lawn applications. This product goes down as one of the worst I've ever used. The active ingredients make up only 1.6% of what you're buying. So what is the rest of the ""mosquito repellant"" consist of? Fuller's earth, also known as CLAY. So, if you want to spend money on putting clay in your yard go for it."
4,Dr T's Mosquito Repellent,"I've used Dr. T's in the past, with success. Texas mosquitos are out in force this year and I hope this will (again) repel these. I recommend this product."
4,We have used this product for years,We love this product and it works great for us. Just wish I could find it in stores.I would add that maybe the folks with the negative reviews either didn't use enough of the product per square yard or possibly have such a great source of the mosquitos (marsh or pond)) it would be tough for anything short of getting them at the source to eliminate them.
1,Don't even bother,"We live near a protected marshland park, and so our yard is loaded with mosquitoes. I spread this according to the directions throughout my half acre yard, spreading it with a fertilizer hand spreader. Even after waiting a few days, the number of bug bites I was getting after was pretty much the same as before. I saw no decrease for my time, money and effort, and I really wanted this to work."
2,Dont buy,"I have several dogs and children running around a shared backyard and thought this would be a great alternative to pesticides. I was wrong, first it does not work! Second it smells like rotten garlic and cat pee!The only thing this product repells is people and dogs!!"
2,just ok,Strong smell. Very strong. It didnt seemm to keep away mosquito for more than the area it was placed in. So I guess you would have to place it in every inch of your yard. Impossible really. and not cost effective...as it seems to rinse away in the rain. Not really worth the money.
2,Works for For A Couple of Days,"It works, but only for a couple of days. It smelled, but I didn't mind it as long as the mosquitoes were nowhere near me. Two days later the mosquitoes were back and the weather had been sunny for the two days. I would recommend this product if it worked longer (I would be ok with weekly) but two days is not nearly enough."
2,"Nice idea, smells good, but doesn't work.","I used this in combination with all kinds of ""green""-ish eco friendly mosquito solutions in Texas, including dryer sheets tucked in the pocket and lemon eucalyptus spray. The mosquitoes in Deep East Texas were NOT the least bit offended by this product or any other safe, natural method this year. But this year there was a different type of mosquito - with stripes! - than I had seen the previous year. The mosquitoes with stripes seem to be particularly resistant and blood thirsty, and sadly, it definitely takes a poison to knock them down."
5,Martin Does it Again!,"I have loved this book more than all of the other Ann M. Martin books that I have read.It starts off in an old gardening shed at the Merrions' farm at Lindenfield. The mother dog gives birth to five pups. Only Squirrel and Bone survive. If you want to figure out what is in the story, you will have to read the book.It is NOT a waste of time reading this book!"
5,a dogs life,This is one of the best books Ive ger read its full of action and adventure its a great book for anyone who loves books about dogs
1,boring,This story is a waste of time. The Baby Siter's Club were so much better but Ann M. Martin did porly on this book. I wasted my time reading this book.I reccommend you read Click Here and Girl Talk Series those two books are not a waste of time!!
5,Very touching,"I enjoyed this book almost as much as Marley. The author has you with the heroine as if you were there. You won't be sorry, it's wonderful."
5,The Most Extraordinary Book Ever,"Have you ever read a book suspenseful and imaginative that you couldn't put it down? If you have not then A Dog's Life is the book for you.This ''autobiography of a stray'', really written by Ann Martin will make you cry during the sad times and laugh during the happy times.This wonderful book tells the story of Squirrel's life and the troubles that she experienced as a stray dog.The message in this heart warming book isnever give up your life's circumstances because they can change for the better.I think this was the best book I have ever read. Anyone who is an animal loverwill love this book because almost all of the characters in this book are dogs."
4,A Dog's Life,"""A Dog's Life"" is written for children but relevant for adults as well. It is the story of Squirrel, born to a stray mother, and her journey through life on her own. The book is told from Squirrel's point of view, and the author took care to truly replicate a dog's point of view. Reading about Squirrel's trials and tribulations would have made me want to do something to alleviate the pet overpopulation/stray pet animal problem if I weren't already a volunteer with rescue. And if it has that effect on you, the author has included references and resources to help you get started."
4,great fun,"I first purchased this at our local Costco several years ago and was disappointed when we tried to play it. HOWEVER, since then, we have gotten a new computer (old one was from 1998) and the game plays terrifically! My son (4 1/2) loves it and while some of the activities are beyond him right now, there are plenty of others to entertain him."
2,Disappointed,"My 4 year old son loves Thomas. He has some difficulty understanding railway adventures but he liked playing...however, my husband & I were disappointed in the quality of this program...During play, the game has frozen up & also is choppy when the characters are speaking...I don't feel it is worth ..."
1,Frustration,"OK, so it's the day after Christmas and I sit down to play this game with my 5 year old son. He plays for awhile, but keeps getting stuck - so I try. I had a horrible time with it too. We couldn't get the track to move where we wanted it to go, couldn't get to the other games, etc. Although my son is 5, he's been playing on a computer for 2 1/2 years already and I'm no computer slouch myself.I found the game poorly programmed with marginal graphics compared to other products. If I had to do it over again, I'd pass on the fancy set-up for the keyboard and software to purchase another Jump Start or Rescue Hero game.Just one moms thoughts...."
5,A huge hit with my 4 year old,"I don't know that my son is any more or less computer savvy than the next kid, but we bought this for him for his birthday, and after spending 30-45 minutes playing it with him, he played by himself for HOURS. We couldn't get him away from it.We were afraid we were going to have trouble with it, because we couldn't get the Tonka Digs and Rigs to work with our computer, but once we figured out where to place the controller on our apparently not-standard keyboard, it never needed a single readjustment while he was playing."
1,Nice Game - Didn't work!,"The CD loaded fine. I strapped the plastic device to the keyboard as indicated and although the ""pegs"" that come down from the device to activate the keys did come down,for some reason did either not match up or did not protrude far enough to activate. When I removed the device and pushed the keys individually, the game would run. Maybe it was just this one and does not happen to others. I had also purchased the Tonka Dig N Rigs Playset which offers the same concept and it works fine..."
1,Very Disappointing,"BEWARE! I am very disappointed. My son loves trains and Thomas, and when I ordered this I thought he would love it. Everything is properly installed, but the playset will not work. I see on the Infogrames website that the FAQs say to use the keyboard if the playset won't work, but what fun is that for a 4 year old - he wants to drive the train! I know it is not the configuration of my keyboards - I have tried it on 2 keyboards. Both times, the playset will press the keys enough to type the characters when I have it in Microsoft Word, but it will not respond when it is in the Thomas program.Do NOT show this to your child until you are sure it will work! I'm sure glad we tried it before Christmas! I sent an email to Infogrames (mfgr) on 12/22/01 - as of 1/19/02 still no response.And once you've opened the software, no refund!!"
3,technical problems,"Great adventures and fun but seems to have technical problems if child presses bottons for a long time, which what most kids do. the speech of the cd becomes slightly impaired."
5,Great game for my 3 year old!,"This was a Christmas present for our Thomas-crazy ""just turned 3"" son and he has loved it! I place the set on our keyboard and he completely takes it from there. He quickly mastered all of the games, but he still enjoys going back and trying them again and again. We have quite a collection of children's software, and this ranks among the best so far for his age group. I suppose from reading the other reviews, you simply need to make sure that your computer and keyboard are compatible with the game and that your child enjoys challenges that require a little more attention to details."
3,Railway Adventures,I have no problems whatsoever with the keyboard issues like others here. However I find that the game is too hard for a 3 or 4 year old to figure out how to work it. The Tonka Rigs and Digs was much easily. Kids these ages don't need something this hard. They only want to get at it and play.
2,"Vague instructions, difficult to exit","My 3 year old son enjoyed ""Thomas & Friends: The Great Festival Adventure"" and ""Tonka Dig & Rigs,"" but this game is too complicated for him to play. I even get frustrated when trying to help him due to vague intrustions. Worst of all, it is extremely tedious to exit the game."
4,Highly enjoyable!,"Only 92 pages, this book is very fast, light ""escapist"" reading, for those of us hopeless romantics who believe in true love and destiny."
3,Remo disapointed,"Well you get what you pay for. cheap drum ,lost its tone after only 3 drum circles. It now sounds awful, Too embarassed to take to another circle. It is loose and twangy. Because it has a synthetic drum head I thought it would not stretch out,but something happened to it. It lost its song.I have been drumming for many years and never beat on a drum with any force.Waste of good money."
3,"Still learning,but noticable high twang","It's pretty good and I'm only a beginner with the drum, resorting to youtube for lessons. Compared to the ones I've heard, this does lack a rich, deep sound that some of the more expensive ones I've seen have, but hay, it's the inexpensive alternative and does the trick while you're learning the ropes."
3,smaller than expected,"While this ice bucket is very well made, it is small. I wish the product information has indicated size. I had wanted to use it for a business conference room and find the bucket did not suit my needs. The product is nicely made though, with double insulated top & bucket."
2,6 INCHES HIGH AND 5 INCH DIAMETER! TOO SMALL!,"O.K. I hate saying/writing negative things... So I'll just write the facts. This beautiful ice bucket is less than 6 inches high (14.5 cms.)and has a diameter (not a radius, but a diameter), of 5 inches (12.5 cms.). My husband and I love buying stuff from WMF. When we go to Chile, we always get stuff there. But this ICE BUCKET... LET'S JUST SAY IT IS TOO SMALL!P.S. My husband hasn't seen it yet!... ji, ji!"
5,Written in clear understandable language,"I'm new to computers and have found ""The Complete Reference"" is easy to use to find the help I need. I liked the CD with the click-on weblinks!!! I have have ""Windows 98 for dummies"" and ""Dan Gookin Teaches Windows 98"" and this is the most helpful by far."
1,"Save a tree, and don't buy this book!","Book fails to address the more in depth problems that Windows '98 users can encounter, for example, the disappearance of Microsoft Fax is very difficult to find in the book, as is the explanation of how to fix this. ODBC doesn't even appear as a topic, in either the glossary or in the text. Unlike SAMs books, Osborne Press doesn' t appear to really edit what they publish for truly useful (to the reader) content. Save a tree, and don't buy this book!"
4,It's a useful book!,I could find answers to most questions; allowed me to move platforms reasonably easily and troubleshoot the envitable problems eg ISP customising software. The book reads well; hints and tips are very useful - nuggets of wisdom (learned the hard way) count for a lot more than obvious explanations.It might be worth adding a link to Rescue Me ! software which provides a good tool for looking at what installation programs have done to your registry and other valuables.
2,The book was compilation of cut and paste windows screens,"I was very disapointed with the book. The content was nothing more than I could find using the windows help index. It was a compiled list of cut and paste screens from the help menus into a document. If the Title of the book were something other than ""Complete Reference"" I could have understood. I bought what I thought to be a comprehensive, in-depth book to use as a reference guide, but what I got was a VERY basis overview of windows 98."
4,AN EASY LISTENING ALBUM,"This album is quite good, but to be honest it doesn't have the right amount of jazz in it. It has more salsa than jazz and that's ok, but if you are expecting ""the album"" of salsa + jazz this is not the one. This album is easy to listen, and makes you happy, and that by itself is quite good.But if you are looking for a nice combination of jazz + salsa the album from Tito ""Golden Latin Jazz All Stars: In Session"" does the trick, an exeptional combination of good jazz and Tito's magic rythms..."
3,Spotty.,"This is a must-have for Coward fans if only as a curio--but it's not really great work. Several of the artists seem not to understand what's going on in the songs. (For example, Vic Reeves, in ""Don't Put Your Daughter On The Stage, Mrs. Worthington,"" makes the mistake of saying ""She was as lovely as Peer Gynt"" instead of ""She was lovely as 'Peer Gynt'""--obviously not bothering to find out who or what Peer Gynt is, nor how to pronounce ""ingenue."")Texas' version of ""Parisian Pierrot"" is excellent, and so is Marianne Faithfull's poignant rendition of ""Mad About The Boy,"" but the real highlight is the Pet Shop Boys' cover of ""Sail Away"": meticulous phrasing; a wonderful short guitar solo that you could imagine being performed by The Shadows; clever use of nautical sound effects. Coward himself would have hated it but I love it.There are more misses than hits on this CD--but again, it's worth adding to the library if you're a Cowardophile."
2,...not much love for Mr. Coward has been lavished on this..,"....the attack is relentlessly contemporary and it seems to me sadly out of keeping with the spirit of what they seemed to be attempting. Elton John, Sting, and Marianne Faithful score the two stars--and the rest of the participants do not seem to have done any homework at all. They are clean and spotlessly dressed, and they perform in a space that has a delightful Deco demeanor...but they make no attempt to accomodate Mr Coward and bring us in anyway closer to him. Too bad!"
3,"Great Beat, heard on KKJZ Long Beach","Up front, I have only heard 1 track from this CD. Tito and the other percussionists kept up a great Latin beat as ever, and the horns were sweet and hot. I sat in the car to hear it thru to the end. Wish I knew more, sorry.Hard to compare this with his stuff from the 1950s. The Concord period might be called conservative in terms of song selection, but the sound quality is flawless.Hope others can contribute specifics like personnel and dates."
5,"A ""must have"" for those interested in Goetic Evocation","Having been lucky enough to purchase a signed limited first edition of this book years ago, I must say that Savedow's book presents a wealth of information on Goetic Evocation. I have read several books meticulously detailing Goetic ""theory"", and much has been written on summoning spirits into crystals and mirrors. This, however, is the only modern work I have come across that gives a first person account of successful Goetic Evocation to PHYSICAL form. Mr. Savedow's meticulous journals detailing his goetic experiments alone are worth the price of this book several times over. If you are thinking about undertaking Goetic Evocation, buy this book. If you are an armchair occultist and want to know about Goetic Evocation without putting yourself at risk... buy this book.Looking forward to your translation of ""The Book of the Angel Rezial"" Mr. Savedow."
5,Bravery,"This book is very worthwhile for a few reasons:1. Savedow gives his version of a workable, practical system of Goetic magic.2. He's not afraid to imply that magic is not just hyped-up psychology or some modern mythology.3. Savedow is creative, and careful.This is a good addition to any library for someone that wants to understand the physical aspects of magic, and what can be done."
1,Obsolete,The Demons are free. Anyone who still uses the Goetic methods of summoning the Demons is only inviting disaster....
5,great for dogs with allergies,"I recently had a very difficult period of allergies with my 2 dachshunds. My older dog is very picky about treats. he will only eat soft treats, no hard biscuits whatsoever. Now that he has been diagnosed with allergies to wheat, corn, chicken, and rice, I can't find ANY soft treats to give him. He loves the fish treats and they are now his only treat, so I always have some variety on hand."
2,Kind of Insightful,"I really liked the first chapters of this book, but It kept saying in the later chapters that niether is our religion not a religion but ""not a viable way of life."" Otherwise, its an insightfull look at what most xians see in us. why they might be angry at us. I learned a lot from this. And, Craig S. Hawkins? Wicca is a religion, a way of life and a viable one."
2,not entirely accurate,"yet another book based on half-truths and misunderstanding...though admiditly better researched than most...and just for anyone out there considering this book as a way to ""dialogue"" with the Pagains for the purpose of ""evangelizing""...most pagans and Wiccans cosider any form of prostelyzation to be the height of rudeness and inconsiderate, disrespectful behavior."
4,"I came, I read, I loved it","A great read and very informative. I can now bring up Vercingetorix in casual conversation. One caveat: the maps could have been much better done. They are dark and hard to read and tend to precede the narrative somewhat, so they give away what little suspense there is. (OK, we know that Caesar ultimately prevails but he did lose a few along the way.) Read a few pages beyond each one and then go back."
4,Ceasar's Obsession with conquering Gaul.,"I really liked the book, but I wish the author had gone into more detail about the Celts. It's very good reading and has really gotten my interest about what happened in Europe after the fall of Rome."
4,In depth review of the Gallic Wars and Julius Caesar,"This book examines Julius Caesar and his conquest over the Celts during the Gallic Wars. The author has done much research from ancient and modern sources to try to distinguish fact from fiction in regard to Caesar's ""Commentaries on the Gallic Wars"". The book also examines the backdrop for the action, the political intrigues back in Rome.I thought the book was a good insight into Caesar's conquests. The author sites his references so that readers can go back study deeper into the Gallic Wars and the politics of Rome. I think this is a good supplement to anyone interested in Julius Caesar and Rome during his lifetime."
4,Track Listing,Track Listing1. You're OK - 3.042. If I were you - Main Mix - 6.033. If I were you - Smokin Lounge Mix - 4.114. If I were you - Junior's X-Beat Mix - 7.27
1,How stupid!!!!!!,"When I saw the Chettah Girls I cracked up! Only a baby would like it! All these little girls think Raven sings great and NEWSFLASH!!!!!! They can't sing! They lipsing! Don't you people ever watch MTV???? They interviewed them and they admitted that they lipsing. Raven can't sing at all. Neither can the girl from 3LW. They are pathetic and anyone who likes it is too. *Hope i didn't offend anyone"""
1,Winner for the WORST movie of the year!!!!!,"Oh my gosh!!!! This movie is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hoaky,cheesy,and a movie you only want to watch once- and NEVER again! PLEASE TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"yawn, yawn, yawn.","only two stars for the songs. Boring,and drawn out and it was stupid. maybe little kids would like this crap, but not me. the songs were catchy that's about it."
2,What a bad movie!,I love Raven! But this movie was so bad I walked out in the middle of it! The acting is so bad!
4,My 7 yr old just loves this!,Lots of music for her to enjoy and dance to and to act like a teenager!
4,Good,I was impressed by this movie until i saw i saw the second one which was directed by Kenny Otatager which made a difference the music is better and so is the dancing but this is a highly recomended film
1,dont waste your mony on this CRAP!!!,"My sister got this. she watches this almost every day and its soannoying. They cant sing,act, or dance. they also lipsing.They also have the dumbest names Galleriea,Doh,Aqua,and i think its chu chi. SO dont buy it!!!!!"
1,AWFUL!!!,"When I first saw this movie on Disneychanel, I was like, ""Is this a joke?"" It was the most terrible thing I've ever seen! The girls are obviously lyp sincing. The ending was stupid. In fact, the whole thing is stupid! Take my advice, don't watch this."
1,Its Cheesylicious!,"Cheetahlicious? Don't make me laugh. It's more ""Cheesylicious"". This whole movie is made for 2 year olds! I mean, come on! They sing songs like ""Together we can"", songs like that belong on Barney or Sesame Street! This is unrealistic. Especially the ending when Galleria's dog Toto is stuck in a sewer! And when all the other former-members came, why were they all wearing the same thing but just another color? Come on! Cheesylicious! They voices are more poppy than Britney Spear's voice. It hurts my ears terribly! It is a sad, sad attempt at comedy. DON'T BUY IT!! DON'T WATCH IT ON DISNEY CHANNEL EITHER!! BOO!! IT SUCKS!!!!"
5,Pass the Pigs,"A great game for a wide range of ages that always leads to laughter and silliness. Using math for score keeping makes it educational and it's not necessary to strictly follow rules, you can make your own. It's a nice size for packing for travel too. Why toss dice when you can toss pigs!"
3,Disappointed,"After reading the many positive reviews for this classic game, I thought my family would really enjoy this. But it is boring. You don't ever need to stop rolling, since the pigs rarely end up touching each other in order for you to lose points. No skill, no strategy."
1,Don't Pig Out!,"Got this game for Xmas from my adult son and have had so much fun playing it with both children and adults. The pigs are much quieter than regular dice and tend not to bounce off of the tabletop. It is very compact -- fits nicely in my purse. You can't go wrong with this fun game, but don't be greedy and be sure to pass the pigs before you pig out!"
2,Disappointed with the new format,"The score sheets are ridiculously small. Need a magnifiying glass to even read it. Can't imagine how a kid could even attempt to write down a score!...I sure couldn't!The game only comes with 2 pigs. What if one gets lost? it could happen becasue they are so small. It would be nice to have at least 4 of them. Also, the devise for shaking the pigs is too narrow. Mostly the pigs get stuck in it. We use a cup from another game instead. Overall, it is a fun game, we have the one from the 70's which came with 6 pigs, so we have them all. A large cup for shaking, and score pads that are large enought to write on. Why they changed the format I will never know."
4,"Great game, new silver case not as good as the old black box","I've always loved Pass the Pigs. However, the new design for the case is not a good design, in my opinion. I remember my old set being in a black plastic box. That thing was DURABLE! My family still has our old set at the house that we threw around as kids. The new design is cheap plastic with a clear ""window"" on the front. After about a year, I already have a crack in the top. I'm in the Army, and I bought this game to put down in my ruck sack so I can whip out Pass the Pigs to occupy my down time, and remind me a little of home. The game is still as awesome as I remember, but I'm just not a huge fan of the new case. As long as you plan on leaving this at home and treating it delicately, you should be fine."
4,"Here, Piggy-Piggy!","The game, according to the rules in the box, is all about tossing pigs (instead of dice). This is probably a good game for a small party of people who wish to pass the time while laughing a bit.You score points based on how your pigs land. Some positions actually hurt your chances of winning.The only thing I can think of that would make this package better is a small dice cup. However, dice cups are easy to find. So I am not rating this product down from 4 stars. Normally I might give this product 5 stars, but I am trying to be at least somewhat objective--this game doesn't have a lot of educational value, aside from adding up your points. But it sure is fun!"
4,quick & fun,This game makes you laugh. I like that it is simple to play & easy to learn. NOT lots of rules to remember & fast moving.
4,Don't pass on the pigs,"Great little game that the kids can pull out and play any where.My son can easily get his dad to play several rounds of Pass the Pigs, because it requires only a small flat surface to play and that means daddy doesn't even have to sit up, much less get out of his recliner!They are math nuts, as well, and this game is fast enough to keep them adding mentally. I am a teacher, and would use them in my classroom. Good for all ages, intermediate grade levels and up."
5,This is a great game!,This is a great game that provides hours of laughter aggravation and fun. If you want a good family game then this is the one.
3,"Great game, a few quibbles","We fell in love with Pass the Pigs at Christmas, so we bought four more from Amazon, for gifts to friends. I don't know if it's because these were the Deluxe Edition, or what, but they're different. The carrying case is different, stylish and more streamlined, maybe, but cramped. The score sheets are tiny, and almost illegible. But the biggest problem: the left ear seems to be slightly shorter than the right, so that there can be no ""leaning jowler"" position to the left side, and neither of the pigs lies flat on its side (I think, still because of the short ear) and we've had to award many ""razorbacks"" when we suspect they should have been simple siders (1 point) or ""pigouts."" A letter to the Pass the Pigs company was answered, but didn't address my suspicions."
4,Great fun for the money,"This is a really cute game if you're looking for something casual. It's small and portable and can be played by anyone who can count. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes to have games around to play with friends or family. You can play it in 10 min if that's all you have, or play it over and over again for hours."
5,great for kids,My 9 and 7 year old girls love this game. I loved it when I was a kid too. Helps with math skills!
3,Okay game,"I bought this game because my friend's family plays it and loves it. We have played it a few times and it is okay, but not as much fun as I expected. After you get over the fun of trying to figure out what each pig position means, then it just becomes a game like rolling dice to see how many points you get. We grew bored with it after a few plays."
4,fun,fun game with a handy case. kids think this one is pretty funny and love spending time playing it with the family
5,Love the pigs!,"We had so much fun playing this at Christmas..so ordered ourselves one and have really enjoyed it...you can visit and laugh as you play it..and everyone we play it with has a ball! Good, simple, fun game!"
3,Pigs in a poke,"This is more of a gag gift than a game of chance or skill. I remember playing this in Iowa on a cold evening, and served more to break the ice than to challenge the players. The actual ""pig dice"" didn't seem as large or sturdy as I remembered them, and this set tends to roll the same position 80% of the time... but then don't we all?"
1,Pass On Pass The Pigs!,"This game had good reviews and my granddaughter likes pigs so I purchased. However, I think the product is too small. When you ""roll"" the pig die, they land in various positions that really all looked the same to us and were difficult to compare to the various pictures in the instruction which you are to compare to and determine what type of ""roll"" you made. The score pad is so tiny ther is no way my handwriting or a kids handwriting will fit in the boxes. We truly could not play this game. The price was way too much for this flimsy set. I do not recommend. Sorry."
5,Fun with a Pig? You betcha!,"Just like dice - but more entertaining! I used this game to fill time at my son's ""camp out"" birthday party. The boys were 8-11 years old and had a blast ""passing the pigs"" around the table. Just don't ""pig out!"""
5,The Funniest Game Ever,"Oh my gosh. My cousin and his girlfriend came over with this game one night and my family has been addicted to it ever since. At first I didn't think it would be that great, but its just one of those game that you just get into. Once we started playing we couldn't stop. It's a really fun game."
2,Not that fun.,The pigs are very small. Would be a great game for travel. But my family didn't get into it and we love games. Wasn't that fun. I will stick with a deck of face cards.
5,Never leave home without it,"We purchased this about 10 years ago and it goes everywhere. The rules are based on the dice game ""Crap out"". We modify them to create a game that can be stopped at anytime. We play with them while waiting for appointments, at restaurants or even while waiting for the car to be serviced. The only downside is that the dots have worn off but we just used a sharpie and put them back on."
3,Difference between Pass the Pigs and Pass the Pigs Deluxe,"I purchased Pass the Pigs Deluxe by Winning Moves from the internet thinking there were differences in the Pass the Pigs game distributed by Milton Bradley and the one by Winning Moves (The game by Milton Bradley was all sold out on the internet). Sorry folks, the only difference is the packaging. Both games have the same sturdy plastic pig carrying case and the exact same contents. However, in the original Pass the Pigs game the instruction packet is larger while in the Deluxe Edition there is a very small instruction packet. So, save a few dollars and ""try to find"" the original in the box. I got lucky and found the original in a Pharmacy.Enough of the complaining. With either game, you would have the same amount of fun. But if you are cost conscious like I am, get the cheaper product."
4,Love the Pigs!,"Great family game. No skills required! I have twin 9 year old daughters who love this game! We've played so much we've worn the dots off of the pigs (therefore only 4 stars on durability). The bonus card game ""Snout"" that game with the Pass the Pigs game is the game the girls really love. Good clean fun with pigs!"
5,The best pigs-as-dice game you'll ever play!,"This was the best stocking stuffer in our house this year. This game basically consists of two small rubbery pigs, but they are cleverly shaped and weighted so that each pig can land in six different positions. With two pigs, you get many interesting combinations, each of which has a point value and a funny name. The pigs can even land in the ""piggy back"" configuration. This all sounds silly, and I guess it is, but the large quantity of laughter makes it very worthwhile. This game is adult-worthy, and the cool plastic pocket-sized carrying case (with special pig-shaped places for the ""dice"") was just the right size to fit in a stocking!"
5,FUN little game,"This a fun little game. Good for math skills. Also good for ""don't give up"" attitude because several times one of my son's was losing but then other son rolled a roll that made him lose all of his points.My only complaint... the pigs have a dot on oneside (part of game). Well that has rubbed off after less than a week. No big deal - Sharpie to the rescue. Also their is some darker pink paint on bottom of feet - that's rubbed off too."
3,Keeping Child Occupied,"I recently took a trip with my 7 year old nephew and while waiting for a delayed flight this game was handy. Small enough to fit in a mom's purse to take to long doctor visits, etc."
4,love it!!,"I bought this game as a party game, but have ended up playing it more with my two youngest kids. They love it, and it's helping reinforce basic addition too. I have a preschooler, and a first grader and they both play it with me quite often. I think the fact that it's pigs and not dice makes it more engaging for them and less work oriented. They're doing the math and not even realizing it! I'm very glad I bought this game. :)"
3,"Look Ma, batteries not required","I discovered Pass the Pigs more than 20 years ago. Living on a small farm in the backblocks of New South Wales, my circle of friends and I were always seeking games that entertained the whole family, could be played by any number of people and were inexpensive and fun to play. Pass the Pigs met all these conditions. What IS it about this game? Some might call it mindless and trivial and, like most television, perhaps it is, but unlike television, repeat playings never jade - I enjoyed Pass the Pigs in the 80s and the enjoyment has not faded with time. I have only one major gripe. I'm sure that the pigs in my replacement set are smaller than those in my original version. Are the manufacturers sailing so close to the wind that they needed to save that iota of whatever it is they use to make the pigs to appease their accountants? I have given it only one educational star and this has probably downgraded the overall score - don't let it turn you off the game."
2,Trivet in the Slow Cooker - My update - leg inserts are no-go!,"Stainless steel is the way to go and is what my first expandable trivet is made, with twelve plastic caps for the SS legs.to sit on and not produce any scratches. I bought it purposely for use in the bottom of my HB slow cooker. It fits and does its job perfectly. When cooking is done it's fairly easy to clean.Quite expandable it will serve many other uses. Should last almost a lifetime. Shipping was ahead of schedule. Highly recommended.UPDATE: Not highly recommended since the plastic caps I found, after first one fell out, ooze faulty black adhesive and black gook will line your cooker. ...the next 11 (loose) I pulled out myself. Smarten up: Stainless is great - but mfr. should un-gook those horrid leg-caps. Might even be POISON!"
3,"Story, anyone?","No one that knows me will ever accuse me of turning down yaoi/shonen-ai in any form, and Level-C is no different. However, I often enjoy some good story with my gay sex, and Level-C's version of a story is more of an after-thought than the manga's main concern.I had first heard of and seen Level-C in it's anime form, and I appreciate the manga for expanding upon it; but in either DVD or manga form the story is STILL too brief, and the romance too rushed, compared to other titles available. Still, the characters are cute and the story is light-hearted and funny. I don't feel cheated when watching/reading Level-C, I just wish there was more! Recommended to all yaoi fans, however.Only big complaint: It has a wimpy uke (bottom). Why oh why must 95% of ukes be made into rape victims during sex scenes?"
3,Hmm not bad at all,"I really enjoyed this story so far! I mean I didn't expect alot to come out from it but it was sweet. I must admit that the books are a bit off on somethings but it's Yaoi and it's more settle then the prevoius yaoi books I have. But if you are really in the mood for some causal all-guy, lot of sex, sexual contact then I suggest this story."
1,No Plot and Iffy Art,"This title has little or no plotline, whatsoever. It's extremely hard to follow and it seems that the author decided, 'when in doubt, add sex.' The characters' incorrect anatomy kept me from enjoying any part of this book. I was constantly bothered by the fact that their bodies just didn't look right. This is not a flame of any sort, because I love yaoi, but I need at least some kind of relevant plot... If you feel the same, this book is not for you. If you just want random sex that has no apparent reason, you might enjoy this..."
5,She Loved It!!!,I bought Lauren Style By Ralph Lauren for my wife assuming she would find it to her liking. I was pleased that she described it as not too sweet nor too strong and smelled as fresh and light after eight hours as when applied.
5,Great Fragrance,"I got this item for Christmas, and I LOVE it. My sister's birthday is coming up and I will definitely be buying her a bottle."
1,"Who has The Geode KIt, By Michael Smith",It's really to bad when so many bookstores list the book Geodes By Timothy Cunningham as a book called The Geode Kit written by Michael Smith. --- Does any bookstore truly have the book The Geode Kit by Michael Smith?? This means it's kind of hard to give a reviewsince what's being offered is noy what's shown. AL
2,Not a Page Turner,"This is not a book that will keep young children engaged at bedtime. Throughout the year Jesse Bear announces ""how he says *it*"" each month. We don't know what *it* is till the last page, and by then, even I wasn't curious any more. The ryhming text is not always closely related to a season (September: ""With clothes that don't fit and no place to sit, I say it with buttons today."") and won't make sense to young listeners.The illustrations are colorful and busy, and young kids will enjoy the activity. However, I think this book is better for 6-7 year olds and library shelves."
2,Pretty basic stuff,"For someone new to relationships and men and very little experience, this is a fair review of various aspects of relationships from communication to sex. But it is for all practical purposes mostly common sense or just scraping the surface. Don't expect to walk away from this book with any revelations on how to please a man. The first 1/4 of the book for me was pretty retarded to be honest :) The rest of it, well you could definitely learn more from gossip with your girl friends! And they don't make claim to be ""experts""."
1,Back to the 50s,"I have two points, sadly both of them not very positive. My partner and I are having problems with intimacy, and we are pursuing ways to 'fix' the problem. If one is new to dating and intimacy this book would probably contain helpful advice. A more seasoned individual will not find this book helpful, nor will it deal with the more complicated sexual situations in real life. The second point revolves around the fact that, in situations outside of the bedroom, the author appears to have mistaken the century, and advises women to be pleasing, personality-lacking, self-effacing 'yes people'. Although I agree with her point that we should always try to put our best foot forward, she is one step away from advocating a subscription to the June Cleaver fan club. I can't dissuade the reader from buying this book enough."
3,Unrewarding in the end,"Over-all I enjoyed this book. It had great imagery and the reader will become engrossed in Joanna's life-long pursuit for answers. Joanna's final discovery (practically on the very last page, bytheway) is beautifully written and I'm glad her daughter apart of it. However, I was sorely disappointed by the unrewarding and sudden ending. Too many characters were left in limbo, there were a lot of holes and questions that lingered. It was as if the author just excused herself and ended it because it had all become tedious (it was 450 some pages of character development she suddenly dropped). Very unfortunate. A sequel is desperately needed to make the ending of this book tolerable. And I would not buy it without a sequel to go along with it. I'll return the book to the library and try not to stew too much."
3,Too many holes,"Like a lovely sweater you receive as a gift, with gorgeous fiber and handwork...but you find it covered with holes where it all unravels. I enjoyed the reading, but was left with more questions than answers regarding the characters she had taken the time to draw but never to complete. A number of times she worked hard on a character (e.g. Pauline) but then suddenly inserted a passage of time and voila! The character has settled down with no explanation. I expected much more from the Pauline/Joanna story line where Pauline asks for help in conceiving. That just fizzled. There were a number of fizzles. This book needs a sequel!"
4,The Dreaming,"I enjoyed this book very much. I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, and the author did a fabulous job of putting me in the story and truly making me feel as if I was in 19th century Australia. I feel as though I learned a lot about the Aborigines, and the characters became my friends.For the most part the story moved very nicely, although there was a spot or two I found a little slow. The reason I didn't give this five stars had mostly to do with the ending. I loved the message of the ending, but we never found out what happened with any of the other characters. I felt as if it never got wrapped up, except for with Joanna and Beth.The Dreaming is definitely worth reading, however, especially if you are interested in the history of Australia."
5,The Dreaming,This is a wonderful book about the Australian outback and the myths and legends connected with the native peoples. It is a story about a young woman who goes in search of the cause of her mother's nightmares and of her own fears about her heritage. It was a wonderful book.
4,Something is missing,"Of course Barbara Wood is an excellent writer, at least for me, but in this book something was missing at the end of it, all the book was perfect, it keeps you reading, but when you finish, is just like that, you finished the book and you don't know what happened with the other people of the book, what happened with Judd? or Sarah? or Adam? or the last expedition to find her?As in all of her books, with this one you will learn about Australia."
3,Book Review,I did read this book but it was overall pretty dull. I have liked other books far better by this author.
5,Pure magic!,"It has been many years since I read ""The Dreaming"", but it is one of those few magical books, that for whatever reason, stays with you always, while others, though good, fade away to oblivion in your mind. The storyline, woven with Australian history and Aboriginal cultural beliefs, grabs you and doesn't let go. Definitely time for a reread!"
3,Good basic information,"The author provides great information on the history of candles and gives good basic info for folks just starting out. However, I was a little disappointed to find many of the illustrations with no explanation. The candles in those photos were simply credited to the source from which the came. There were a couple of these I would have liked more information about regarding the techniques used. Some of the instructions could have been more clearly demonstrated with photos. If you're a visual person when it comes to directions you may be disappointed."
2,Obvious,"This book could be one of the ""Dummies"" or ""Idiots"" books because everything it offers is pretty obvious. This book covers so many topics, it can't go into any depth on any of them. For example, the author says seminars are a great way to get business but he offers only half a page on how to do them. He tells you how to get a trademark without discussing why they may or not be necessary. Also, there are way too many irrelevant stories about millionaires like Michael Dell (who cares how many square feet his mansion is?) and Jeff Bezos. If you already have a business in mind, you have to wade through a lot of chapters about finding the perfect business for you. However, if you haven't a clue about which business to start, the book offers only a surface idea of several home businesses. So it's not useful to either customer."
2,Do You Want to See Clark Gable Jr.?,"A decent B western with James Brolin and Richard Roundtree! It's main draw is the appearance of Clark Gable's son, born shortly have Gable's death, in the 1960s. He doesn't really look like his Dad, and at this point in his career he needed a few more acting lessons. Watchable, three-guys-on-the-owlhoot-trail flick."
3,Easy listening,"I had this CD before in a tape but needed the CD version. The music is great, I do feel that it is overpriced , but I am enjoying the music . I had some free points on amazon that made this purchase possible. I would have been insulted by the price and likely would not have purchased the CD if it were not free for me."
4,"Great shaker with ""Super"" tight strainer/lid...",I really like this shaker but wow that shaker is really in place! I suppose it's a pretty good thing too because I have used other shakers and while shaking up the mix the top went flying and the icky-sticky stuff took a trip around the room. I use mine mostly for making Margarita's. I love that you can keep it in the freezer after cleaning so that it's nice and frosty when you are ready to use it. But........you better work out those fingers and hands cuz brother that lid is tight! I've found the best way for me to loosen it's grip is to hold with one hand and slightly twist with the other while pushing up.
3,martini shakers are not all the same,"Stainless steel! It should be good not to rust. However this one did. When 'brushed' thin plate low grade stainless is used it will always rust.This shaker had the potential to be great, then they used the cheaper metal and in three days it was showing rust at the screen area. Save your money on this one and demand higher quality products from WMF. This one is not recommended."
3,Big Bang Bust,"It's sleek looking & a great entertaining size. Very attractive & modern. But, unlike the other reviews, I find this shaker spills alot from the body slot. It also leaves rings on furniture if any liquid is inside because there is no slip-mat attached to the bottom. Personally, I feel it's very over-priced when considering the down-sides. Honestly, I would not buy again... the cheaper versions are just as good. Try one of them first..."
2,leaks horribly,"looks great, but when shaking, liquid leaks out. Tried it several times/different people in case of user error. Am returning and going back to my $20 shaker"
3,NOT A JUMBO SHAKER,This item was listed on the Amazon website as being a Jumbo shaker.. When it arrived it only held 32 0z which is only slightly larger than a normal 32 oz one. Since I was looking of a bigger one I returned it.
1,Major Christmas Disappointment,"My Dad used to be one of those cool bartenders like Tom Cruise in ""Cocktail,"" so I got him what I thought would be a great cocktail shaker for Christmas this year. What a disappointment. The parts didn't fit together properly, so the first time he used it, liquid sprayed everywhere. My $6 plastic shaker is a much better investment than this $44 one."
3,It is MADE IN CHINA!! & It LEAKS!,"The shaker looks good, big and heavy in hand. However, since Amazon does not state the manufacture origin, WE all assume that this shaker is made in Germany, like most other WMF items. However, it is MADE in CHINA. So, if you are particular about the country of origin, please pay attention! Moreover, in order for this review to be more helpful, I need to mention that this shaker leaks at where the top joins the bottom."
2,"Some good, too much not so good","The good: I do think I am a 'thyroid' type; the recipes and exercises for this type seem in alignment with what my body really needs, as well as the timing between meals -- i.e., 4 hours between breakfast and lunch; and 6 hours until dinner. It worked fine for 5 days -- lost 7 lbs. And then I became uncomfortable with constipation, the weight crept back on until I went three days without bowel evacuation. I have modified this plan so my body can actually work again by adding back fruits to my morning and lunchtime eating and respecting the meal timing. I am physically not able to follow this diet however."
4,Dr Abravanels Body type diet and lifetime nutrition plan,"I heard about his book from my kung fu instructor who had great results, from doing the quiz to find out his body type, and then following the eating plan.I wanted to see for my self,so I purchased the book and in the first week I lost 3 pounds, I do not have a lot of excess weight to lose, only about 6 to 8 pounds.The diet is very easy to follow and you are not hungry, also it is eating real every day food. I am very happy with my purchase, and the great results."
3,Good Theory but Actual Diet Not Appealing for Athletes,"I was intrigued about the body typing process and want to learn more about it. However when looking at the actual recommended diet/foods to eat, I was a little disturbed, especially because there is too much emphasis on dairy and refined grains, does not address pH. I am an endurance athlete and I think the recipes are tailored to very sedentary people. There are many aspects of the nutrition that I don't agree with, or it seems out of date. I'd like to hear more about the trigger foods for each gland."
3,"Almost perfect, but not quite","I titled this review ""almost perfect, but not quite"", because I find it interesting that the author has changed and edited this book from a perviously released book. I found this book to be hard to follow without much help and support for the ""lay"" person. Try Jay Cooper's book, ""The Body Code"". In it I found much help in the exercise area with real life changing techniques to help with taping in on the ""exercise high."" I have never enjoyed exercising, until I tried Jay's techniques, I learned there is an actual ""euphoria"" experience achieved when exercising at my specific target heart rate. Dr. Abravanels book is okay, but why settle for okay when you can obtain GREAT!"
2,"Lists, lists and more LISTS","This book is very similar to Jay Cooper's the Body Type, except that this one doesn't really mention amounts and concentrates more on lists and lists of food. My main beef with it is that it doesn't really give scientific rationale for a lot of things, such as why T-Types HAVE to eat the whole egg. I confess, however, that it really boils down to the diet NOT WORKING. This is the same problem I had with Body Type--there are certainly not four body types; there are mixed ones. And for the latter, they are miserably lost with these types of books since mixed types present a completely different challenege and eating style not covered in the books. Alas."
5,Great diet for those who have strong cravings that make then fail to lose weight,It is a great book. A bit confusing as to body typing but there is a number you can call for help. Easy to follow meal plan for life not just for the actual weight loss time. A must for those who have failed more times than they wish to admit or are constantly yoyo dieting.
3,"Good, solid eating plan.","I liked this book and thought the eating plan for my type (Thyroid) made a lot of sense. I followed the plan closely for about a month and lost weight. Felt better, too. I had a look at all the plans for all the types. All are healthy plans, so I expect whatever your body type, following your plan would definitely result in losing weight and feeling better, both physically and emotionally. I was very proud of myself for stopping sugar ""cold turkey"".As with any eating plan, you have to believe in this one and WANT to change the way you eat. I particularly liked the very specific instructions. I personally do a lot better if there isn't ""wiggle"" room. I won't follow this plan 100%, but it has given me pause for thought and I've proven to myself I can do without the sweets. Pretty cool."
2,disappointed in this book,"I found this book very difficult to use. First, you have to answer a bunch of questions to see what type of body you have. Well, that was useless, because I found that I could pick more than one answer for each question. Second, once I finished with all the questions, I found out I tied for two different types. I gave the book away:("
3,good info...hard to follow,"The info in this book is great, but it requires TOO much of a life change to stick to. Some of the suggestions make perfect sense, while others are just excessive..."
2,God forbid you are a G type!,"I was excited to get this book. I knew people who lost weight using it. Um, as a g type you get to eat nothing! Minimal protein and lot's of fruits and vegies. No seasoning and very little fat. Honestly, I didn't need a book to tell me that was a good idea. Made food way to much of a bummer. I'd rather be my 10 pounds over weight then not be able to enjoy a steak!"
3,"This Book Needed a 90's update, especially with exercise","Dr. Abravanel/Elizabeth King have obviously been threatened by Jay Cooper's book The Body Code, and felt it necessary to update their eairler publication. Congratulations, your book is certinally more well rounded. Just keep writing books, and stay away from your ""Skinny Schools"" and you will probably be more creditable this time around."
1,Finally got here,"After three weeks, gosh it finally arrived, and it wasn't in the best of shape but will do, not like what I would consider good condition as posted here on amazon. Anyway, at least now I know it didn't crash in a plane and burn up, which I was beginning to wonder about actually. Still got no tracking data on it, the entire time, had to contact seller, and then they just said we have fourteen days, it's only been 7, the standard CYI response. This is what I do know, I remember them now, I know that I will never, ever do business with them again, you can if you want, unless you don't care if your product falls off the face of the planet that is."
4,Safeguard your fine China,"These cases are a bit skimpy in size, but they do protect very well with adequate padding. It's a stretch to fit a service for 12 in the alloted space, especially if you intend to separate your china with inserts. Even so, I recommend these - have had them about 2 years now and they're holding up extremely well. We've moved with the dishes in these cases and nothing was damaged."
4,"subclinical scurvy - what, ME ?","I will always remember this book as the one which led me to reconsider my discounting of Pauling's Vitamin-C-megadose-theory due to the chapter 5, which contains selected tidbits of True History ( of scurvy ) interwoven with plausible fiction.Four stars because the ""plausible fiction"" often sounds so contrived - for five stars the author might rewrite the book after searching for more tidbits of True History to base each scenario upon.Still, to read the wikipedia article confirming that humans ARE genetically defective - opposable thumb check, but we can no longer make Vitamin-C while e.g. goats still can, and an adult goat will synthesize ""about 13,000 mg"" per day, more when sick. Strangely, no one had ever explained it to me that way before !"
3,Not really worth buying...borrow it from the library instead,"This book is entertaining, but many times follows a very cliche pattern of speech and character. The first thing that the consumer must know is that these stories are FICTIONAL and based off of several accounts that the author received from friends and interviews. Somehow the information presented packs less of a punch with the knowledge that the stories are not true. Also, I could not help but get the sense that the author was trying to impress me with his outdoors saavy (he repeatedly trumpeted his talent as a backcountry skiier and kayaker and such) and his misguided word usage. The medical information is sometimes informative and other times very cloudy and vague. Stark's attempt to mix medical fact with fiction is a bit akward. Do NOT look to this book for survival skills! At best, it provides a small window into human physiology.Overall, this book is a fun and fast read, but not worth adding to your library."
3,Lacks Something,"The Martyrs' Torch, written by Bruce Porter, Rachel Scott's Mother's Pastor has some good insights. His intervies with Rachel's brother on the night of the shootings is chilling. There is so much pain and raw emotion displayed. Even the content of his speecha t the memorial service inspiring people to lift the martyr's torch that the title refers to is very compelling. Whree the book starts to drag and lose its bite is when Porter starts to get preachy and give advice. This needlessly enlongates the book and takes away from both the heartfelt stories of Columbine tragedy and the over all quality of writing in the book as a whole. I recommend Rachel's Tears for a life changing book about Columbine and the tragedy of April 20, 1999."
1,hysteria based on a fiction,"This book claims that the Columbine victims were all martyrs for Christ. They weren't. None of them were. The author of this book would have us believe that the Jeffco sheriff's dept and the media are in cahoots against Christianity and therefore have kept the ""real truth"" about the martyrs from the public. What a bunch of bunk! Is he so desperate to hang on to his 15 minutes of fame that he will stoop this low?"
5,A must read for everyone!,"I am Rachel Scott's father. Bruce Porter did an excellent job of protraying my daughter's passion for her faith. This book will challenge you in a way that few books can. Once you begin reading it, you won't be able to put it down until you finish."
5,Cat Treats,One of our Ragdoll Cats has an allergy to chicken and this is the only treat we could find that does not contain chicken.It is a quality all natural product.
1,This stuff is Dangerous,"This product is so dry it can cut a Cat's mouth, cause bleeding and choking. The product I received from Petco was dry as a Bone. It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first. You wouldn't feed your Family Fish Bones. My cats are my Family.Maybe te product I received was no the usual quality, but it was dry, dry dry. Both the Salmon and Whiting were equally dry."
5,I have a finicky cat...,"...and all I have to say is ""stinky salmon treats"" and she comes running from wherever she is to get this jerky-like treat!"
4,They are good for presentation of appetisers,"I would not recommend to grill with or cook with unless you expect to only use them once, but when used as appetizer holders, they look great for presentation on a table with appetizers in them."
2,Not one of his best,"I love Neil and Freedom is a great song, but overall this album is not very strong"
4,Essential Neil.,"I had enjoyed ""Neil Young"" as a casual listener before this, but ""Freedom"" is the first album of his that I totally absorbed and loved. Whether it's his ""comeback"" or not doesn't really matter, it's just near perfect in my book. It starts and ends with different versions of ""Rockin' In The Free World"", one of his signature songs. Both amaze. ""Crime In The City (sixty to zero part 1)"" is a great epic track, and ""Don't Cry"", ""Hangin' On A Limb"", and ""Eldorado"" are all slower, but moving, and have great guitar throughout. Other highlights to me are ""Too Far Gone"" and the excellent ""No More"", which I think was another single from this album. I'm now a huge fan of 15 years, and if I kept only 3 ""Neil Young"" albums, ""Freedom"" would easily be one of them."
3,Cd case was broken,Cd case was broken; where the center hole of cd theres a kind of spindle; this was shattered; one of the reasons one spends money buying a cd rather than just dowloading is to have a that cd case.
4,Neil Delivers Once Again,"Several nice tracks on this recording. The anthem/march version of ""rockin in the Free World"" is a Neil Young classic and displays the raw edge Mr. Young has turned into his trademark sound.My favorite track on the recording is the cover of ""On Broadway"". I can almost see Neil laughing as he blasts through this tune that has been covered time and time agian. Unlike other, Young puts his signature on this song and provides the listener with a fresh rendition of a somewhat overdown song."
4,very good mr Young,Neil is a very good song writer he can sit down and do just about any kind of music this is one of his overlooked cds and very different than most of his cds cool guy
3,"Good songs, inferior performances","This, for me, is a very exasperating album to listen to. While I can appreciate the quality of the lyrics and melodies of some of the songs especially the ballads, the ensemble playing of the uptempo tunes sound monotonous and not very diverse from one another. The performances of Young's back-up band are pedestrian: the drumming and bass-playing sounds so uninspired. It's possible that even Young may have had some misgivings over the sessions because he seems to have tried to salvage the work in the production process. It doesn't really help much."
3,although there are some standout tracks. some parts are just an absolute yawn,"this gets three stars because 1. it's one of the first nyoung albums i purchased 2. there are some great, great tunes on here (check out the acoustic 'rockin in the free world, too far gone, crime in the city, and 'on broadway', also the electric 'rockin kicks butt too). The rest of the album is really a bit boring to me."
4,Don't Cry,"It's worth it for 3 songs - ""Don't Cry,"" ""Someday"" (a song about Erwin Rommel! Maybe he'd been reading one of those Time-LIfe WW II books or something...) and ""Rocking in the Free World,"" of course."
4,An inspired and varied Neil Young release,"When I saw Neil at Jones Beach, NY in June of 1989, I'm convinced that I saw an invigorated Neil. In his mostly acoustic set that evening, he performed the rendition of ""Rockin In The Free World"" found on this album; Bruce Springsteen came out for an encore; and it was a memorable show all around. From that point, I highly anticipated the release of ""Freedom."" The album didn't disappoint; and was his finest in many years. There's a good mix of tender, pensive acoustic numbers and electric fury here to satisfy. Particularly striking are the haunting ""Wrecking Ball,"" the lovely duets with Linda Ronstadt, and the self-revealing ""No More."" The electric version of ""Rockin' In The Free World"" to close the album seems a bit excessive."
1,It didn't work,I believe it was even in the original package and looked in excellent shape except it just showed snow and I tried it on several machines.
3,????,"I'm actually surprised I didn't really like this movie. I think the bases was good (terrorists with a bomb- I know it's not that original) but I didn't like how most of the movie (almost half!) was about Arnie and his wife and their problems, It was unrelated to the bases of the movie. The 3 things I did like were 3 characters I think were caseted perfectly, Arnold (need I say more,; HES THE MAN DUDE!), his funny sidekick Tom Arnold, and the pervert Bill Paxton. Worth a watch though, just not has good as i thought/or expected from the great duo of Arnold and Cameron."
4,fantastic,this is a fantastic film one of arnolds best it will look great on blu-ray i cant wait to add it to my collection of classics in good cases:)
4,true classic,"a perfect combination of action and comedy, a true blockbuster. Arnold is always at the top of his game when teaming with Cameron. Now where is the blu-ray? Fox please release the bluray of this movie and you will sell so many copies."
4,The Arnold's best movie,"True Lies is probably Arnold Schwatzenegger's best movie (the other candidate might be Total Recall). The overall story is nothing original, but there are a lot of funny, light-hearted moments and it's an entertaining movie to watch. The Arnold is actually likeable in this film, although the other Arnold (Tom Arnold) is quite annoying. Tia Carrere is gorgeous. There's just a lot of action and comedy in this 1994 production. This is a movie I've watched and will watch again many times."
4,This ain't that bad.,"Some people say that True Lies is one of the movies that are really overrated. But it ain't that bad. It may be because I'm a Cameron & Schwalzenneger fan, but for real, I mean it. When I see James Cameron's films, I can see a pretty good story. But this one doesn't have a good story. It's the action and preposterous ideas Cameron shows us this time what he didn't show it to us. Action here means real total action. Not like T series or Aliens, but TOTAL action. Like a no-brainer. Arnold was as cool as he were and the dancing scene by Jamie Lee Curtis was...... You know. I give it 3.5 out of 5."
1,Disappointing,"Saw it in theater and thought it great. Enjoyed it on VHS, but was so disappointed with the sound and picture quality (or lack thereof) on DVD, I returned it to place of purchase and got my money back. Based on customer reviews, I wonder if I got a bad copy. The opening scenes were terrific picture-wise, but for the rest, I had to keep the remote handy to constantly correct flesh tones, and the sound quality was no better than what I heard on VHS."
2,HERES A TRUE LIE....THIS MOVIE BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why even start on this movie? It has a paper thin plot and terrible acting and really does nothing for anyone. Jamie Lee Curtis was annoying and the only time she was cool was when she was dancing and when she smashed the one way mirror with a stool. I really found Tom Arnold funny (thats not a typo, really, he was funny) and Shwartz was just awful. Well, seeing as how it was from Mr.Titanic, you can guess the quality of the film right?"
2,Please stop James Cameron,"Mild escapist fun. Only worth a look if you haven't seen it.There are some good sequences and FX (a bridge blowing up, excellent missile effects) but overall the drama feels stilted, plodding. In particular there is a really slow fifteen to twenty minutes when the main character chooses to interrogate his wife. In the theater it was painful. At least on DVD you can just hit skip.The humor is decidedly lowbrow. The Bill Paxton subplot did not work as well as intended. To misquote Paul Thomas Anderson, ""Little dick jokes. I don't know.""Also, the villain was fairly weak, and the green screen composites in the final sequence just look like shoddy work."
4,Great Popcorn movie,Sure it was unbelievable but this is your typical Arnold movie. You watch it for the action and the babes!
5,"Great Movie, Excellent Sound and Picture at a great price!","For years I have been a fan of the films Arnold Schwarzenegger has been in and I have seen ""True Lies"" countless times, and when I heard that the DVD was going to be released I was excited. When I got the DVD, it was an excellent value(below $30) for the Quality of sound and picture it brought to my home theatre, my audience was even impressed with it. I highly recommend this DVD!"
4,I saw it on LD'...,"this movie rocks, it's Jim ""Titanic"" Cameron on command of a high octane spy adventure starring Scharwzenegger (""Arny"") and Lee Curtie (""Jamie""). It's incredible 'till the movie comes to its end and this succesion of incredibles shots (the fuel over the water, the bridge, the Harrier, ...)...enjoy... :)"
4,Great Action Flick!,"This film is entertaining all the way through, it starts out great, then slows down enough to make us laugh a little then takes of full-speed for it's action-packed finale. Great for die-hard action fans. The best Cameron-Schwarzenegger movie outside the 'Terminator' flicks. Really worth your while. Different from the normal action flick, a little different, a little better. Jamie Lee Curtis is great in this movie and I think Schwarzenegger gives his best performance here. But this is James Cameron's movie all the way. From 1-10 I give it a 7."
3,Has Some Good Moments,"True Lies is quite fascinating to watch. The effects are some of the best I've seen, and this is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's better movies. Tom Arnold puts in a great performance, and there are some funny moments from time to time. Bill Paxton also turns out a good performance. The plot's not that great though, and the movie is a little too long. Other than those two things, this is still a movie that's worth a watch; especially for the special effects. Not bad."
4,"high on action, but falls a bit short","True Lies is one of Cameron's less successful attempts to mix characters and romance with strong action - but even then it's not half bad. Arnold has to save the world from nuclear terrorists while trying to save his marriage at the same time. Not bad, but the film doesn't quite pull it all together.Cameron's action scenes are his usual fine work, but with a lighter tone that pervades the movie. There's also plenty of humor to go around, which is also a nice touch. But Cameron can't quite fit Arnold's personal and professional lives together for the big showdown without feeling like there's some scenes missing. (How *do* the terrorists track him down at the most inopportune moment? For example)A bit more editing and a few more explanatory scenes could've improved True Lies, but all-in-all it's still an enjoyable popcorn muncher.The DVD itself comes with a nifty menu, but only the standard trailer+chapter select features."
2,Not much of an Arnold Movie,"True Lies I thought was nothing that great from Schwarzenegger and would put it on the bottom of my list of his favorite movies. Some of the scenes were kind of weird and stupid I thought especially the one where they question his wife in the empty room behind close doors, just seemed bizarre. That along with the one were he plays that tape recording to get his wife to strip her clothing off, did not really like it or the storyline much. Look towards Collateral Damage or Eraser for a better performance from Schwarzenegger.Peter J. Miller"
4,:0),Love it action pack with tom's humor great and i think bill paxton's character was just too much lol...good for the collection
2,Misogynistic garbage!,"This film has some great scenes and everything but then goes off on this anti-women tangent which just goes on and on... This whole sub-plot about the cheating wife and the revenge taken upon her... .... This stupidity causes no less than the setting off of an atomic bomb in the USA - somehow easily glossed over? And the level of anti-Arab sentiment is just beyond belief. I am not an Arab myself but I couldn't take watching the stereotypes of ""Arabs are all terrorists/fanatics"", etc. A shame overall as it did seem to have some worthwhile potential..."
1,Stupid Movie,"I don't think this movie was a comedy one,nor action.....it was just cheap...I regret the money I paid to watch it, just cheap special effects... Arnold has disappointed me as much as he has disappointed many of his fans.:-("
1,Ridiculous Middle-Eastern Stereotypes,"Not since Sally Field's flight from a pack of stereotypically vicious and stupid Iranian fundamentalists in ""Not Without My Daughter"" has an American film painted such a closed-minded picture of Middle-Eastern people. The Arabs or Persians portrayed in this movie (we're never actually told exactly _what_ they are--the art being smuggled is Persian, but the terrorists are referred to as Arabs) have no identifiable redeeming qualities other than that they're apparently quite adept at theiving massive works of art and waging war on us Americans. This film is yet another exploitation of the transfer of American fear and anger from the Commie Russians to the Insane Muslims in the post-cold war period. They didn't even make a half-hearted attempt to soften the blow to Arab/Persian cultures by casting an actor of Middle-Eastern heritage on the ""good guy"" side. Alas, the star power of Arnie will be too much to dissuade anyone from viewing this movie."
4,Undercover Laughter,"I have watched this movie more times than I can remember. Arnold Schwarzenegger does another hillareous sendup of an undercover spy. If only being a spy was that fun. Jamie Lee Curtis mixed with Arnold Schwarzenegger is a comedy couple matched in heaven. The story line flows with ease, you will find yourself wondering what on earth is going to happen next. If your after a light hearted but very funny movie I recommend not only seeing this movie but you may as well buy it, because your going to want to see it again, and again and again."
3,Fun to watch,"True Lies is a fun film, bubble gum for the eyes, a spoof of the spy genre. I enjoy it once or twice a year."
2,Not the best movie of Arnold,"I've the LD and the effects and sounds are the unique value for this movie. Save your money, try another one of Mr. Schwarzenegger with a better script."
5,Over The Top Violence - Comedy!,"This movie has everything: Undercover agents, military violence, insane anti-American antagonist, great comic situations, Jamie Lee Curtis doing a sexy dance, family rescue... best of all, Arnold. Who else can deliver true grit fighting and side-splitting humor the way Arnold can? This movie has them both in adequate amounts to keep you riveted. Who dances the Tango better, Jamie Lee or Tia Carrera? This movie is just great fun!!"
4,Top class blockbuster,"Arnie is a spy, Jamie Lee Curtis is a housewife. Inside the lies of their marriage are a great many fine stunts and setpieces, with some superb one liners and a lot of first class action.This is a very entertaining and enjoyable film, like James Bond but with less class.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
5,Funny and action in one,"This is a mustsee movie. If you're looking for a nice comedy in wich you can also enjoy great action this is for you. One of the finest performances of Arnold. Don't skip this one... if you feel to it, rent it first but you won't regret buying it."
1,ripped off,I ordered 80 bags for $20.32. I only received 20 bags. I would like to receive the additional 60 bags ordered.
5,superb intro to titian,"for its size, this is probably the best overview of titian available in english. the color reproductions are beautifully done, the sampling of titian's works is comprehensive yet compact. the historical essays on the epochs of titian's output and the commentaries to each painting are well written and highly informative. a few major works, such as the venus d'urbino, are reproduced in smaller format and discussed only in passing, as they could not be included in the exhibition. even so, only rona geffen's study of titian's women goes farther and deeper into titian's originality, humanity and genius. highly recommended."
3,Titian,"There is an imbalnce between text and illustrations. The text is extensive, competent and easy to read. The illustrations are of average quality and tend to be small. Some of Titian's major works such as the Depostion from the Cross at The Accademia in Venice and the portrait of a Doge [Chigi?] at the National Gallery are not included'"
5,She Used to be Mine!,"A Classic! A must for any collector of the ""best"" rock music! It's fast, sexy, slick and so appealing to a 15 year old boy back in 1977! It's still the most popular album amongest the friends I went to school with! Oh, to be able to look the way they did back then with their black pants, shirts, etc."
5,this is great!!! Oh how I miss the Cars,"I loved the Cars, soooo oringinal.the more time passes, the better they are.And this is the set of songs that launched the legendary band."
3,large cracks in case,"CD in good shape, but the case has 2 large cracks on the front and 1 large crack in the back."
2,SERIOUSLY????,cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you? me either. list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most. I wonder what universe this would not be considered great- not a universe I would want to be in. If you REALLY need to be convinced read all the 5 star reviews.
2,BYE BYE LOVE: THE GREAT,"I will give this CD 2 stars because I love the song Bye Bye Love and it is one of the greatest guitar solo songs ever. It sounds like Heavy Fuel by the all time great, Dire Straits. And other than that, this CD is lame. I was listening to this last nightand man, the other songs suck (with the exception of Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, & Just What I Needed). Dire Straits are the best, they have the most talent."
1,Overplayed,"i had enough of the cars for the moment, I hear them on everyradio station in the world and the only album they play is songsfrom this. another album they play is their second album whichis really lame. plus they ain't that good. the singer just singslike a baby, this cars isnt music, this is just noise. I alsohad enough of the overplayed latest Neil Young CD. Radios needto stop playing just Cars, Zeppelin, Stones, Clapton, Aerosmith,& Who. Why dosen't the On Every Street CD from DS ever get played on radios?"
1,Just Overplayed,"Why do radios like this band so much? Radios most likely like these bands,Aerosmith Dream On Sweet Emotion two of the worst songs ever.The CarsNirvanaLed ZeppelinQueen the worst band of all timeEric Clapton Cream sucks.The Rolling StonesThe WhoDon't blame me because the only good song is Bye Bye Love."
5,How can you walk away from a classic at this price,"Front to back, this has to be one of the best debut albums of all time. You'll want to surf this new wave again and again."
4,Great Set/First set was broken,"The chairs and cusions look great with the strathwood table and chaise lounges and are comfortable. Our first set delivered by UPS came broken, so they had to be sent back and replaced which took about 5 weeks from start to finish, ordered on 6/23/07, delivered today 7/29/07. The new shipping company (EGL) was useing a wrong contact number and I left numerous messages to correct and got Amazon involved several times. Be sure you have a number on your profile that can reach you at anytime - like a cell phone! They did however make a trip out on a Sunday to get them to me, because I was getting totally exasperated!"
5,Organized Crime Encyclopedia,"If you really want to know about the various different gangs, what their business is in, how they operate and where, then you will want this book. The author goes into details of operations used to capture, and at times not capture various transnational organized gangs. On the flip side he also describes how the gangs operate to circumvent the law, including names of major players and which cities they are located in.Ironically when I finished reading one of the chapters on Russian Maffiya there was an article in the newpaper concerning a front company that I had read about in the book. The book covered a lot of information to the extent that when I read the article I was thinking that there was a lot missing that they either don't know about or don't want to print. Check out YBM Magnetics, read this book and find out what they don't tell you."
2,"Not So Bad, Not So Good","well, this book certainly is well researched, but the author needs to decide- is it a solid work of unbiased fact, or is it a liberally laced opinion piece? He seems to come down somewhere between the two, which leads the reader (well, that's me in this case) wondering how much is true, and how much is speculation and wish.Lots of names being dropped and used, and if I truly wanted to take the time and learn what EXACTLY was going on in these crime organizations, I would need to keep a small notepad next to me so I could swiftly recollect each character everytime he was named.An OK overall summary of the past 30 years in organized crime, but if you want to truly understand the inner machinations of these globe-spanning organizations, look elsewhere."
2,plagiarized,"Boy, this book was upsetting. Nearly everything is plagiarized and cherry picked from other books. The bulk of the book is from Friedman's The Red Mafia.One concludes, reading this book, that Robinson is intimately familiar with the criminal mindset, since he didn't hesitate to copy and paste entire passages from Friedman, without so much as a credit!You're better off downloading a few pdfs off the internet, and getting the Friedman book, than this sorry imitation of non-fiction.Actually, then again if you are too lazy to browse the net, and need a racy intro to the subject, maybe this is a good bet. Caveat Emptor, a lot of Robinson's stats are outright inventions or completely off base. Keep that in mind, as you read this forgery."
1,"Biased, outdated, inaccurate, and full of grammatical errors","This book is a big disappointment. Buy this book and you will regret it. First, the writer is biased. Second, the book is outdated. Third, there are MANY things that are inaccurate (short of fiction). Also the book is full of grammatical errors.[...] Whatever privileges they enjoy, they EARNED them through decades of suffering."
1,LAME,"This sounds outdated and the quality of the recordings isn't very good. If you want a 5 star piano CD, buy Blues 88's on EasyDisc."
3,Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines,"Very easy to read and understand. The author makes a real effort to elucidate the subjects. The material is interesting from a cultural anthropolical view. If one is seeking to practice I would advise a different book to follow, since this one does not go into specifics for yoga. Rather the monks seem to focus on the esoteric aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. However, it is an interesting book to read philosophically."
4,Complete guide,"There is everything about Tibetan Yoga that you want to know, but I cannot give full rating to this book because I found a bit boring the writing style."
1,Kinda hard to rate something you don't have!!!,"I STILL HAVEN'T RECIEVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never had this experience, and it is os frustrating! I am losing points in my class!!!"
3,Cute but annoying to take ipod out,"I thought this case was super cute and I love my pink converse shoes so this was perfect for me. But after using it, it is a pain to get the ipod out. I use a dock and of course my ipod wont fit on the dock with this case on. Also headphones that do not have a straight plug will not work with this case. If you like to use your hold button, you will not be able too as the thick rubber material around the case makes it too think to reach the hold button. Over all I feel it does the job protecting my ipod, the clip is solid and its super cute. But it does get dirty really fast and makes recharging the ipod a hassle."
4,An interesting mix of all forms of techno,"Live At Burning Man is a 2 disc non-stop dose of acid, jungle, and trance techno. The rhythm stays at a steady pace most of the time, with only a few dull tracks. It's alot better and faster than most American techno, so it's definetly worth a listen if you like electronic music. Astral Projection is still my personal favorite for this type of music...be sure to check out their work as well."
5,Wonderful custard dishes,"Pyrex makes the greatest custard dishes, but to put condiments into for your meal. These are heavy-duty, not like the ones my mother had and hold up to just about anything. I dropped one and thought it had shattered, but these are so heavy, that they didn't even have a scratch on them. Great for the kitchen and whatever you need them for."
5,Great product,I got these to put yogurt in and to use for cooking. They are well made with very strong glass.
5,Pyrex custard cups are great for food storage!,"Great small bowls (size- 2 cups) with tight fitting lids for storing my homemade yogurt, vegetables, etc. I will be purchasing more of them."
4,A tad too big,"The only issue I have with these larger custard cups is they are a tad too big for me, but my husband loves them and uses them all the time for his yogurt. Nothing wrong with the product, just not quite right for my own day to day cooking needs."
4,Dishes,Beware. There are STORAGE and there are bakeware dishes. Bakeware you can store things in - BUT STORAGE you can't BAKE in.
5,Very useful for lots of purposes,"I also have lots of the 6-ounce cups. Haven't actually used them for making custard yet...These are the good, green-tinged, glass bakeware."
5,Pyrex Bakeware,The 10 oz. custard cups are great! They look - and are - very high quality. I have found many uses for them. I especially like to use them forsmall amounts of dip for each individual at a gathering for eating chips or veggies.
5,Nice little addition to the kitchen,"Have used it for many different occasions. The best thing about these cups, is that they are oven safe. Pyrex are leaders in cups and containers"
3,Nice looking shoe,"This is a very nice looking shoe, but is not the most comfortable dress shoe I've had. Could use some type of padding for people on their feet quite a bit."
2,Not durable,"These shoes look nice and are reasonably priced yet after three years I find myself in need of navy shoes again. I only wore the shoes intermittently and only on Sunday's, so not much wear and tear at all. Yet the stripe that runs down side of shoe all the blue has rubbed off and look tacky now. Disappointed. Quality doesn't match looks."
5,Nice!,Great shoe for a great price. I think the shoe looks much more expensive than it is priced. I get complimented on them all the time. I also bought the black ones.
1,not worth the money!,"God knows how much I love NSYNC, but this phone is not worth the current asking price, trust me! I bought it for my 5 and 12 year old daughters, one each, so they wouldn't fight over them, and they were excited to the max to see them in the package. That was the first and last day (the only day) that those phones have gotten any of their attention. With the guys repeating the SAME answers OVER and OVER again, it gets old VERY fast! And the CD games? Those are a JOKE! Stupid, just totally stupid! A VERY remedial bowling game, where the guys heads are the top part of the pins??? Even my 5 year old said, ""Mommy, this game is dumb""! I still cannot believe that NSYNC would endorse such junk!As much as I love them....Shame on them!"
4,Very very good!,The phone is very cool. It's really great because you tell them your name and the time you go to bed and they ring you and say goodnight! It's like a real phone it's so cool. If you don't answer the phone they leave a message. You can call them and ask them questions. The phone is great but I don't like the games very much so I gave it 4 stars.
3,It Needs Work,"In fairness I feel every electronic has some sort of glitch.Here are the pros:Here *NSYNC call You at bedtime, and throughout the dayListen to their crazy comments in their bowling gameHelp dress your favorite *NSYNCERProve to *NSYNC you know their facts. If you make a mistake they may respond. Those that know it all may impress them to say a few phrases!If you can win the most difficult levels you'll see the group recording lines in the game, and more. This is the best aspect of this game, making it something worth having!Here are the cons:This game could be improved on. If you don't have the special sound card, you'll have to purchase it. This can be frustrating. I had to wait days, before I could play, because of it.The navigation, and games are complex. Younger kids may tire fast.The toy phone is flimsy, and the back pannel hiding the battery falls off, and broke completely within less than a week!"
5,Great Toy,"I am ... a HUGE NSYNC fan. I know this toy seems childish, but it is a lot of fun. It's really well made (I've had it since Christmas, and nothing has gone wrong yet) The instructions are easy to understand, and the menues are simple enough for small children. The games might appear to be ""lame"" but they are actually fun, and become quit addicting.I've brought my phone to school with me to show my friends and as long as I turn the ringer off it will never interupt a class."
2,Recent Review,"THere was only one piece that I thoroughly enjoyed and that was the solo on ""My Lord, What a Morning,"" but I can tell you that one song made the purchase worth while.Phil B"
5,Burak the best,This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time.I hope they cut some more of these as I ordered 3 more on the wish list.For listening and dancing it is the best.Every one that comes to my home and hears this Burak CD loves it.This guy is good and the back up is beautiful.---D.Boyd.
4,useful reference,"I bought this for the communications department at my company. Myself and two other co-workers have referenced it and found the information useful on a handful of occasions. Most of the manuals we write are not for software, yet despite that, this book contained useful information we were able to leverage in our hardware documentation. The only thing that could make it better is if it discussed more about writing user manuals for a global audience, i.e. manuals that will be translated from English to a variety of other languages. That is a pretty specialized niche though so no points deducted for that."
2,not,I wouldn't leave a comment on this but it wouldn't allow me to just leave my rating so ignore this entire thing.
3,Not As Good,"Ok,I love Haste The Day.Burning Bridges and When Everything Falls are two amazing cds.This One isnt as heavy as those to.There are a few songs that kicks it up.Most of them are sad and not what you would expect from haste the day."
2,Floor Console,"The idea is really good and I couldn't pass the price. I got this for my f350 truck. When I received it, I took it outside to install it in my truck. The size is perfect. I'm not sure if it was damaged in shipping or what, but the 2 parts comes comes out really easy. When you lift the back, where you store your CD's it well come a part. Also the cup holder are not deep, and it won't stay foot. Every time you turn, it slides.It would have been a good idea, if they made the wall thicker, put 4 holes in the corners. Or mold it to a hump cover. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Good, not great","I you want to read the goods on Bukowski, check out Neeli Cherkovski's Bukowski: A Life. And if you want to see how bad Steve Richmond is threatened by Cherkovski's book, read the review Richmond posted of it.Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I bought Spinning Off Bukowski. I'm glad I read it. Hell, I'm glad it exists in the world. The more material out there on one of America's greatest writers the better. It's especially important that those who knew him intimately get the words down on paper.This effort has a lot of good anecdotes about the two writers' old days in California, but I wish there were more pages about Buk in it and fewer about Richmond.If you're like me, you'll want everything you can find on Bukowski, the well done and the trash. This book is not trash by any means, but it's not all that great, either.Buy it, read it, put it on your shelf, wait for the next one that comes out and get that one, too. That's my plan, anyway."
5,Hank would buy this book,"A great book about buk by his drinking buddy, pal, and longtime devotee. Its hank warts and all, a very personal bukowskiesque picture of the man behind the poesy. It has the familer raw truth feel of a buk poem. In honor of the great man I'll bring it down to this: THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR EVERY BUK FAN!"
1,full of typos and errors,"This is a review of this particular edition. It contains countless typos and errors, which made me very conscious of it being a translation, and a very poorly copyedited one at that. ""Litty"" for ""Kitty,"" ""were"" for ""where,"" etc., etc., and in some cases I suspect dropped text, though I've not had a chance to compare the text yet to another, more reliable edition. It's really a pity that the experience of reading what is often a marvelous novel is marred by such carelessness. The publisher/editor should be ashamed to have put out such a sloppy edition of one of the great classics of literature! This edition is a true embarrassment."
2,problems with kindle,"In my Kindle edition, the sentences are in English but they break into the Russian alphabet on nearly every page. It's very distracting. I hope someone can correct this rather major flaw."
2,Anna Karenina,"This book was our Book Club choice for September and one that I had to read.The story content about Anna Karenina could have been condensed into two chapters.This may be one of the all time great Classics but the pages and pages on mowing meadows,Political meetings of the landowners, lack of women's rights ,unfaithful husbands who get away with it etc.It's all about Tolstoy's philosophies (it's almost his autobiography)As for Karenina's infidelity, nowadays it wouldn't raise an eyebrow. I believe that when it waspublished girls were not allowed to read it . It was too shocking for the young mind.I'm sorry if I offend anyone but I found it profoundly boring, but that is just my personal opinion."
3,Classic,"What I got from this book is exactly what I expect from a classic novel. Roundabout conversation, an event here and there, clever sayings throughout, but nothing that moves me personally."
3,Dull Story,"I know this is a classic and Leo Tolstoy is a famous author; but this story drags on and on. Leo explains things in such detail and then repeats again. I found myself skipping sections because I knew it was just a repeat of what I had just read. I did find that I didn't care to much what happened to the characters. I just kept reading so I can say that I did read it. I enjoy other books from this time period; such as Jane Austen's, so I figure it is just Leo Tolstoy's style that I can not stand. I am not even going to attempt to read War and Peace. Though, I am interested in reading his non-fiction work The Kingdom of God is Within You."
3,Translation somewhat dated,"I would not deign to review Leo Tolstoy, only the translation.Reading Anna Karenina felt like barging through an 800 page Russian novel. Garnett's translation is in irritatingly Victorian prose, and it really gets in the way of the book. The translator pair Pevear/Volokhonsky released their own new version, and it is said that every generation needs its own translators. P/V's translations are in much cleaner prose, and after half a century's translator's fetish with accuracy and literalism, is probably more genuine to te text, although I can't say that without having read the original Russian, which I can't. Well, if you do have to read it in translation, you can get a better one than this."
4,"years pass by , human feelings don`t","when i had this book in my hands i realised that people share the same worries from many years before, and share also the same feelings.love , romance , jelousy , mystery , relationships that are forbitten .love came when she didnt expected it.what can she do? is it so wrong to love and be loved? is it so wrong to be happy ? do you love yourself more , when you leave everything behind? is she more happy with a new lover? is the purpose of life to satisfy only your personal feelings? those are just a few questions that bothered me when i was reading anna karenina.its a fantastic book that gave me many true messages."
5,Free Classics for Kindle-gotta love it!!,"I love my kindle. I do not love that I can no longer pass around books I purchase to friends and family and they to me. So I look for ways to save. I did a sort one day by price (lowest to highest) and found all the great classics--for F-R-E-E !! I know there are other ways to get free books for your kindle, but this is just so dang easy! I am excited to be reading some great books I read many years ago!"
1,Beware the free kindle fire edition,"Great book - Bad translation---I started reading this free version on my Kindle Fire and noticed that the writing felt a bit clunky. No, worse than clunky - just plain BAD. I then got my paperback version to compare, page by page, phrase by phrase, word by word, and realized how utterly awful the translation really is. You won't have to read far to realize the translation is quite awkward in parts. If you've read AK before, you'll likely find this very unsatisfying. If you haven't, you may just end up being confused and annoyed. Please don't bother with this - just get the real thing! Used bookstores are sure to have inexpensive copies if you don't want to spend much."
4,A classic,Loved it! I was sucked in by the characters and felt all their happiness and disappointment along with them. What an inspiring spiritual enlightenment! I can't wait to see the movie and determine the differences from the book.
4,Downloaded perfectly,"What can I say? It downloaded just fine, but it was not a story I was totally enveloped in-if you like this author/story, you will like it."
2,Anna karenina,Interesting to note the history of this book compared to today's world and the relationship between Russia and the church. The political process in Russia has been changed.
5,Lovely perfection.,There is a reason this book is a classic. It gives a wonderful perspective into life both inwardly and outwardly.
4,"excellent reading, interesting book","A superb and well written classic, easy reading, with an enjoyable story line.A romance which is not, over-the-top, but rather down to earth and typical for the period. Filled with intrigue, which leaves you in anticipation of the next page.Reading by Kindle is comfortable and easy reading compared to holding a heavy book. I have a heavy leather bound special edition of Anna Karenina which I wanted to read but could hardly lift - Kindle is the answer to my prayers."
4,"Russian Novels, OH BOY!","Set in the time frame of the late 1800's, this book digs into the functioning of Russian high society, and the terrifying emotional lives of a related group. Anna is drawn into adultery by Vronsky, and instead of being discreet, makes such an issue of it that tragedy ensues.Anna, though central to the story is only a modest portion of the movement of the whole book."
4,Timeless story of the cost of moral decisions.,The book is a time machine that takes you back into Russia before Lenin and you join a family of the nobility to see the wreckage their poor decisions cause.
2,Format Issues,"I bought this for my Kindle, but it's too distracting to read as all the lines are fragmented. I ended up buying a different version."
4,Tolstoy at his best,"If you have only seen the movie, you must read the book. Follow Anna on her journey through life and you will truly see how it was in that time."
3,get what you pay for,Never read Anna Karenina & finally decided to tackle it when this Kindle version was only 99 cents. The layout is strange & harder to read than most Kindle books. Great book despite the layout
2,Difficult read,Long drawn out and a difficult read. Possible due to translation. Was not captivating enough for me to enjoy. Didn't call me back when I put it down.
4,A long read but worth it,"I really like reading books that are of a different time, in this case over 100 years ago. I like the older, more formal prose also. Now, I wonder, was Anna was bi-polar? How different her life would have been with the proper medicine. But best of all was Levin 's turn toward faith."
5,Book,This was the first digital download for my new tablet. I enjoyed this book and the ease of downloading books.
2,Anna Karenina,At times it was interesting. At times I thought it would never get to an interesting part again. Hard for me to follow. Russian's have multiple names and it made it confusing. I invested quite a bit of my time in it and didn't end up finishing it. Wouldn't recommend it.
2,Sorry,"Sorry, it was not what I had expected. Quite long and wordy and was totally different from the love story that was described. The ending was a surprise though."
3,hards to get through,This book is a hard one to get through. Never finished it. Right now I'm just putting in words just to fill up the required number for a review.
2,Disappointed,"I read Anna Karenina many years ago & decided to re-read it as I loved it then.I received my Kindle copy yesterday & eagerly started to read it.The translation is terrible & in many instances doesnt make sense.I started to get frustrated with it & thought ""this isnt how Tolstoy writes"".I have since found my paper-back copy of many years ago & am busy comparing the translation.I am up to Chapter 22 & am thoroughly disgusted with the Kindle version of this supposedly fantastic book.Will stick to the paper-back from now on even though its more convenient & lighter in the Kindle.So much for free e-books.Disappointing."
3,"Great character development, long story","Tolstoy develops fantastic characters but never uses one or two words when he can use ten or twenty. Perhaps it's just this translation, but in this book there are many passages in French (some of them fairly long) which are not translated and can leave those of us who don't speak French a bit put off."
5,Best novel ever?,"All-time great and free on your Kindle compatible device (can read on an iPad as well). Trying to get through this before I see the movie, but there are earlier versions of the movie that can be streamed as well. Lots of ways to enjoy this story!"
3,reading and reading and reading,"and still it has not gotten to the point. Never having read this ""classic"" I felt compelled to do so in advance of the film which I will see...........I'm sure it will live up to all its acclaim as I move forward..................."
4,Too much junk.,This book was requested by my wife. I have read a third of it and find it somewhat boring as it goes on about nothing for too long.
3,slow book,"I wanted to read this book before watching the movie. I had to stop reading at 20% into the book because the slow pace got to me. I was mostly interested in reading about the relationships between Dolly and Stepan, between Kitty and Levin and between Ana, Alexey Karenin and Vronsky. There was just too much time spent describing Levin's days at his farm. Maybe some day I'll go back and finish this book but I just lost interest for now."
4,Anna Karenina,"I had never read this classic story, so when I saw that it was available decided it was time to do so. I have only read 2 chapters so far, but I think I will enjoy it."
4,Awesome,"Really good book! Besides the French dialogue I enjoyed the book a lot. It's a great love story, but depressing."
2,In a word- boring.,"I've been reading it for days and am only about a third of the way through. It's a slow moving story and somewhat hard to read with the use of all the proper names. I keep reading more hoping it will get better, but I may just abandon it. It may be a classic, but I think I'll watch the movie instead."
3,Anna K,"I enjoyed reading this book for the second time, even more than the first. It seems I will insist on relating to the slow and steady character of Levin over the impulsive dramatic Anna K. I should have given four stars instead of three if I had not gotten the distinct feeling that both character's were used as a device off teaching us how to be good little boys and girls, thereby keeping me from being able to feel a truer connection to their story no matter how wonderful the author."
4,Literary Classic!,"I am a HUGE fan of Kiera Knightly, female star of the movie now in theaters ""Anna Karenina""! Decided to read Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece before seeing the film (I usually do things the other way around.). Having my Kindle Fire and access to Amazon's list of material, it was an easy decision, one I'm glad I made. ""Anna"" has held in me Tolstoy's grip, weaving in and out of the lives of his characters, sharing their very thoughts and gaining insight into the very times they lived in. Would I have those times again? I'll leave that question to any one who loves reading Classic Literature! Enjoy!"
3,Disappointed by this translation,"I much prefer the translation by David Magershack (Signet Classics). Perhaps it's a case of heightened expectations not lived up to because I'd read so many wonderful reviews about this translation. It's still one of my favorite books of all time, but mid-way through this new translation I returned to my ancient dog-eared paperback. If I didn't know Anna Karenina was translated, I would think the Magershack version was simply better written. However, if you've never read this book, any translation is a worthwhile endeavor."
1,misleading announcement,"Very disappointed that Amazon would present such an important book without adequate information. Does ""original"" mean that this copy is in Russian, or that this was the first translation into English? When such a wonderful new translation appeared a few years ago, I bought and enjoyed rereading Anna Karenina. This advertisement distracts the public from the knowledge of the better new translation. Please do not waste our time this way again."
1,Boring,I bought this book because it was free. I haven't got very far through it and I have little intention of attempting to get further. Boring.
4,"Of Love, Disaster, Adultery, Socialism and Cheap Vodka","There is much dallying in the hayricks of the country, and in the regiments of the great cities! But luckily for 19th century Russia, DNA testing hasn't yet been invented, or everyone in Moscow and St. Petersburgh would discover that they are related!Even the trains are coupling--a portent of bad things to come, because Anna sees a man smashed between the two cars as they hook up. Anna realizes right off that this is not good!If Anna's Vronsky, (who is all wrongsky for her) really loved her, he would not have drawn her into this web of disaster, where she loses status and her beloved son.However, without Vronsky's dynamic pull, there would be no story.Anna Karenina is a testament to the adage that no one's life is ever so bad that they can't make it worse! A good read a la Madame Bovary!!!!!!"
1,The most boring.....,"I felt it my ""duty"" to read this ""famoous"" book. All my life I've heard of Anna Karenina. It was the most boring book I've ever ready. Pages and pages about agriculture in Russia at the time......the honing of communist beginnings.....and a plot that is no different from the modern line of infidelity, broken lives and junk!"
2,not one of the better literary classics,"I wasn't very impressed with this novel. My biggest complaint was that the story moved way too slow and that it was constantly being interrupted by Tolstoy's philosophical preaching and political discourse. Barely half the story is even devoted to the character whose name is the title of the novel. There were long and unneccessary pasages that had nothing to do with the rest of the story, like the hunting chapters. Anna's irrational and crazy jealousy was irritating. One minute she loves him, the next she hates him, then she loves him again. Anyway, this may be considered a great literary classics, but I've read better."
1,Anna Karenina,"I started this because it's a classic, but didn't care to finish it because the characters in it are idiotic."
3,"ok, kinda good","If u like old romances, with intrigue this is the way to go, but if not, u should pass on it. I personally like it"
1,Did not like this translation at all.,"I previously ordered a printed copy of Anna Karenina (Signet Classics) translated by David Magarshack and was enjoying it immensely. I had about 300 pages left to read when I received my new Kindle Paper White. I was anxious to try out my new Kindle, so, I ordered this book in the Kindle version because the version mentioned above did not come in a Kindle format. I was very disappointed in this version's translation. It did not capture the same essence as the translation by Magarshack. I could not bear to read it even as anxious as I was to use my new Kindle. I went back to finish reading the printed version."
1,No Way!,I hated this book. Right after the first chapter (which was insanely long) i quit reading it. I dont think im going to ever restart reading it either
3,Historical,It was an Okay read. Interesting from a history point but dry in middle. Ended as expected but still recommend it.
3,Wondering why I kept reading,"The book goes on and on about really unimportant happenings. A chapter, but several on the same subject. Aarg! Besides being long. It was ok."
5,The Great Book,The Perfect Piece of Art--amazing man he was!No novel in contemporary society could touch it!Writing a review about this book by me is not worth it--he was a great man and he wrote a great book.
3,Somehow Great and Boring at the same time,"I started reading this just because it's a classic and I was in the mood for something traditional. It's an interesting story, and I enjoy the way Tolstoy writes (albeit a translation), showing many sides and perspectives to a variety of social themes. However, what can I say, I got bored reading about someone cutting the grass for fifteen pages.I have yet to finish this book, and I started it months ago. Normally I would wait to write a review until I've read the whole book, but who knows when I'll pick it back up again."
4,What's not to like?? It was a FREE download!,"Tolstoy wrote this book in the late 18th century and it has been considered a classic ever since. With the new movie version of the story out, it was a good time to finally read Anna Karenina. Wonderful descriptions of life in Russian czarist times that give a strong understanding of the mores and customs of the times."
4,Romantic tragedy,"Love romance stories set in other countries, but wished it had a happy ending, well thats real life for you."
3,You've got to like love stories,"Just because something is considered a classic doesn't mean it's for everyone. Compared to Tolstoy's other works, Anna Karenina is a fairly easy read. I, however, am not really into romance so it wasn't my favorite book."
2,Anna Karenina,I thought it was too like most Russia novels. Long and political and not true to history. Too many discrepancies.
1,difficult to read on a kindle,The formatting of this Kindle edition was so bad that I deleted it and bought a paperback version to try again.
4,Anna Karenina,"Anna Karenina is a hard book to review, yes it is a brick of a book and you need a lot of patients to get through it all, but it really is spectacular story. Sure nothing really happens in the story but the characters are just so well written you don't care if the plot isn't progressing quickly enough for your liking. The story is fully of love, infidelity, a battle of classes and the fading out of an old society to make room for modern society. You can really feel the characters coming to terms with a new way of thinking while still wondering if they should revert back to the proper conduct of an old society's upper-class citizen. If you have the patients and love a story with well written characters this book is well worth reading, it simply is a masterpiece."
5,loved it,"i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story, years ago. at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start. finally, i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long, it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going. its an amazing book and has become one of my favorites"
3,Anna Karenina,"I didn't make it all the way through this one. I had to read it in a lit class in college and found it just as ""okay"" as it was then."
2,"Book advertised as NEW, sent as a USED copy","I ordered what I believed to be a NEW copy, and received a USED copy. Not in bad condition, but not what I ordered."
3,Got What She Deserved,"Very predictable end of Anna - deceitful, selfish and immoral with curse of physical beauty and seductive wiles. Really didn't like her ever. Most admirable and lovable character is Levin. Tolstoy did great job of portraying society and culture of the time but really dragged it out."
3,Anna,"OMG. This goes on forever and forever. However, I'm not a quitter so I must finish. It does keep my interest in all the different plots and characters but Tolstoy definitely spent many pages describing in detail the whole scene. 70% complete right now."
2,Avid Reader,The most tedious book that I have ever read! I had wanted to read this book for several years and was very dissapointed with the excessive wordiness of the author. I do understand that the book was written in the 1800's but that's not enough of an excuse. I thought it would never end!
4,A Classic Worth Reading,"Although I read Anna Karenina when I was a young woman, this time around I saw more clearly the many levels of this story that I missed the first time. Tolstoy is a master. If you like getting a glimpse into the history of Russian life, especially the relationships between men and women, this book is a must-read."
2,Not in Russian,Indexed under Anna Karenuna in Russian. Has a Russian cover but it is entirely in Rnglish. Translation is unattributed to boot.
2,Way too long,There is just way too much tedious detail in this book. I gave up wondering when it would end and just hoped it would end.
5,There is a reason this book is still popular,"This book is so amazing, it is easy to see why this book is still so popular. It draws you in and you really get to know the characters, even if you don't like all of them."
3,not sure,it's been hard for me to get into this book. not sure why. i gave it three stars because it might just be me. i will try again at a later time to get into it.
4,Wow,"Very long, but definitely worth the time. Some of the French was hard to understand as I do not know the language, but the context made up for the occasional untranslated phrase."
4,Good read,"My comments are about the free Kindle version. Although this free Kindle version is not the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation it works. The opening line ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way""; seems to be the one most referenced. One other note, the novel uses French and to a lesser amount German lines. Thus if you don't know the languages it is a problem. There are no notes in this free Kindle version. I was fortunate to have a paperback that I could refer to while using my Kindle file."
4,Very enjoyable,If you like Pride and Prejudice then Anna Karenina will appeal to you. I really enjoyed reading it and leant a lot about Russian Society and history in the early days. The book is really long. I look forward to seeing the movie now.
5,"Very-long-book, absolutely exquisite detail of personalities and life in aristocratic Russia","Took forever to read this book, but I was continually amazed at the wonderfully detailed characters, his fine eye for the customs of high society, his wonderful descriptions of life in the country, and the great counter-point love story of Levin and Kitty, to Anna's disregard for society's rules. I haven't seen the current movie yet, but read about it, and the book is focused very much on Levin and Kitty, while the movie has their story sidelined a bit. You can see how at home Tolstoy is both in the court and city aristocratic circles, and in the country farming life which he came to prefer."
4,Not sure what all the fuss is about.,"This is the first Tolstoy I have read, I have thought about it for years and finally I have waded through it!!! (and I do mean waded) For me the build up of the novel and the author have outweighed what I found, I ke[t thinking the story and the writing would grow on me and I forced myself to finish the book; as that is my way."
3,Awkward Translation,"Translation in Anna Karenina is very awkward at the beginning of the novel. I am only on chapter 19, so have a long way to go to finish it. Haven't had much time to read lately.Joan Fields"
3,Some good points,"It is a slow read. The Russian names are very difficult. The story goes on and on in several directions. It's depressing, the poor woman throws herself under a train."
3,Anna karenina,"I picked up this book for two reasons, primarily. I had read a number of literary professionals had rated this the best novel of all time; and I had just finished War and Peace. Although including very deep themes and passages, Tolstoy in the end turns overly melodramatic for me. The mental anguish and gyrations just become too much when applied to every day events."
3,"Jacket doesn't match edition, but book is in good condition.","The book was great quality, but the description was misleading. The seller offered to let me return the book, but I did not want to deal with the hassle. If the edition of the jacket cover is important to you, do not buy from this seller."
4,Good buy,This book was in excellent condition and the price was unbeatable given that the book was practically brand new.
3,"A great novel, but not for everyone.","Don't think twice about the reviews displayed here that praise the novel's merits - they are right on. The cult of Anna is large and strong for good reason: this novel is a great work of art. It's an interesting story with great characterization that has the eerie effect of transporting you back to czarist Russia. Yet the characters seem fresh, not as though they belong in some Kremlin storage locker. But I gotta tell ya, Anna is not for everyone. As much as I loved this book, I found the narration distracting and the prose long-winded. And it is very, very long, so if you are prone to putting books down after a while and then finishing them later on, Anna might not be for you. But as much as I didn't like this book, it's great points are great, it just wasn't a good fit for me. One more thing, I was encouraged early on by one of the best opening paragraphs I have ever read."
2,Poor translation,"Anna Karenina itself is a terrific book. When you're reading a Russian book in English, though, the translation is everything, and this translation is not the best. Not only does the translation change the meaning in spots, but words and even entire sentences have been completely left out of the book. At times, the story does not seem to make sense - then I switch to another translation I have (Pevear/Volokhonsky), and voila, there is a missing sentence or paragraph that clears everything up."
1,Missing text/sentences make this annoying to read,"I was amazed when I first discovered the missing text/sentences in this edition, but I am halfway through this book and have many many times come across places where it looks like this: ......"" said Vronsky. And the missing text is just not in there to read!This is a five star book but I give a 1 star rating on account of missing text which is unforgivable IMO.I don't understand how this has happened???"
2,Not an easy read.,I found it hard to read. The translation was not very well done. Kept stumbling over odd use of words.
3,Anna Karenina and social mores,A slow read. All 3 story lines bring attention to the questions of socially accepted behavior integrated with religious teachings. They are and will be the questions that haunt mankind until the end of time.
3,Oldie but worth the read,"The length of this novel is daunting! The characters are so clear, the author paints them right into the imagination. While very long and somewhat over ""wordy"" this book was a good read. It leaves you thinking."
4,Soap opera.,I like the style of writing and the sub-plots more than the actual story about Anna. One long soap opera.
2,ANNA KARENINA- LEO TOLSTOY,ANNA KARENINA ....Much too much detail. I was a captive audience or I never would have finished the book. The author belabors a point until you don't care anymore! - Mary Ferson
3,Bird II,Worth reading it may take awhile to understand the long introduction of the characters but Tolstoy wants you to be clear on what there part is even if the introduction is of a character who is introduced but once.
4,Great story,"I'm not really an avid classic literature reader, but I decided to give Anna Karennina a try and was not disappointed. It is long, but the plot lines really keep you interested. Anna is complex, but a character many women today could still relate too. Kitty and Levin will absolutely make you fall in love with them and break your heart."
2,difficult,Have tried to read this book a few times but now that there is a new movie out I think I will go see it instead.Wish I could get through it.
4,in search of a meaning to life,The last 50 pages is what makes the book so much worth the read. I don't know if I've ever been more entranced. One falls into the abyss of paranoia and obsession while the other finds a morsel of peace to help guide his tumultuous mind.
4,Review anna karenina,Wanted to re-read this book as i havenot read since childhood. a very long book but worth the read to appreciate tolstoy writing skill.
5,Anna Karenina,I got this book in order to reread it. It is just as good as I remember. If you haven't read it I would recommend that you do.
5,A Russian Jane Austen,"Reading Anna Karenina on my Kindle has been a delight.Tolstoy has always been an author of whom I have steered clear. I think just because it tends towards being a classic, it is easy to be scared of reading it.It is a fantastic story and incredibly insightful. Tolstoy manages to capture the nuances of relationships: ""As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the sister after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their minds, but , though they talked of outside matters, they understood each other.""How many women, when seeing another cry, feel they ought to summon up some tears as well!?Anna Karenina reminded me of the novels of Jane Austen; the character's innermost feeling and thoughts are clearly perceived and their daily life of love, loss, friendship, hatred are all told in an interesting and captivating way."
4,Great Read,"Even though this book is very long and Tolstoy can sometimes get sidetracked, this is an excellent piece of writing, capturing perfectly the essence of what it is to love-not to mention, a paradigm of Russian literature. Long, but worth the time spent."
4,Epic and long,"Each of the characters in the very long book are depicted in such depth that one feels one knows them personally. That is his great genius in writing. In particular, his effective writing communicates their inner life, and external situation. It is instructive in particular in revealing how unequal rights for men and women plays out in the personal realm. Personal freedom defines men and masculinity, if you are of the upper class, while propriety defines women. The implications are predictable, depression and suicide for some women. This is the Russia of the czar, when even education for girls and women was not common."
4,Book,"I like the book since the movie came out,but it very hard to read with the language it uses. But I'm still reading it."
2,Long and drawn out !!,"This was a free book so I decided to see what it was all about. I don't mind ""some"" details in a book but this just seemed like way overkill. I ended up scrolling through half of the pages because the details of every persons ideas and thoughts were a bit much for my taste. It might be a classic but I guess it just wasn't my type of book. I ended up deleting it from my Kindle."
4,Anna korrinian,"I chose this book because there is a movie about it coming out now. I like the time period, customs of eddicate, relationships allowed and conseqenses of those who went against the rules. I always enjoy a love story and all it contains. Sometimes it was a bit wordy and drawn out. I would recommend this for anyone hew enjoys history, and Internationally travelled to the country's involved. Women would be more apt to enjoy this book."
1,Anna Karenina,"This edition must be a translated version, as I've read Anna Karenina before and don't remember the sentence structure to be so rough. After reading a chapter or two, I put it down and decided that ""free"" Kindle books must not be very good."
4,Classic for sure.,"Didn't know I was paying for this book. It was listed as free, then got charged a buck for it. Dunno what happened. Maybe Amazon just needs their ounces of flesh."
4,"Engaging, complex. Love story-sort of.","I saw the movie recently, and decided to read the book to fill in the gaps. Surprisingly, the book is not as devoted to the ""love story, adultery, shunning, sexism, as I expected. It focuses on the political and social philosophies of class, work, community, human condition. I'm glad I read it."
4,Two words: Russian Novel,"Some day I may do ""War and Peace,"" but Anna Karenina is long enough to cause some pause. It's a great story, like a long Shakespearian tragedy. You constantly compare yourself with characters and judge them along the way. Tolstoy brings you in so close that you begin to feel like you want to be in the story and talk to the characters, perhaps give them some suggestions or warnings. The Russian novelists do a great job with character creation and Tolstoy is particularly great at it. Like a modern movie, he can often make the ""bad guy"" sympathetic. The social commentary is Dickensonian and in Tolstoy, actions have consequences. It you have never read Tolstoy, with the movie just out, this would be a great time to do so. I haven't seen the movie yet, but my experience is that the book is almost always better than the movie. Long, but worth the persistence."
2,This book should have had Raquel in it,If they were going to make it into a movie they needed to use Raquel to star in it sans knickers
5,Great introduction to Minimalism,"This appears to be a re-issue of the album originally released in 1994. I have that first issue, but, apart from a different cover, all the music here appears to be the same.I was already more than a little familiar with ""Minimalism"" long before this and am especially a fan of Terry Riley's music (none of which appears here unfortunately), but hearing a wonderful, well-recorded orchestra like the London Chamber Orchestra take on this music (at a reasonable price) is just too good to pass up.Originally I saw this at a Tower Records store as a ""featured selection"" or else I wouldn't probably have ever caught onto it, but I am sure glad I did. I highly recommend this to anyone that either already likes this form of modern music, or is just looking for a great introduction."
4,Pretty satisfied,The book came just in time for me to get my reading done for class. It had a few things underlined in pencil but I knew that would happen because I was buying a used book. Everything worked out pretty smoothly.
2,Some good kernels in an awful lot of chaff,"This book has some good things to think about. The problem is Pinker has presented some very debatable opinions as absolute proven fact. So, to find the good stuff, you've got to sort through a lot of not-so-good. This was the first thing of Pinker's I've read, and to be honest, I was surprised to find that a man with such a high reputation could be so bombastic in stating his pet theories. I was really underimpressed."
2,Excellent but wrong,"I'm no linguist myself, but Pinker's logical analysis is so weak that an alert reader's conclusion inevitably is: he must be wrong. A common strategy to be convincing is to list all possible theories and to eliminate all but one with supporting facts. Pinker comes up with one single theory, that grammar is genetically determined, and he then lists loads of facts, that happen to be consistent with that theory. However, alternative explanations are hardly discussed, and none is convincingly refuted. At the same time, there are problems with genetically determined grammar, that he doesn't bother to talk about.If there had been good arguments for a genetically determined grammar, I'm sure Pinker would have mentioned them, so I consider this book a very good indication that the theory is a wild guess at best.Still, Pinker is an excellent stylist, and his collection of facts is extremely interesting taken individually. For these reasons alone the book is well worth reading."
4,We Make Up the Rules As We Go Along,"Steven Pinker serves as tour guide through syntax and language development to support his most compelling claims that all infants come into the world with linguistic ability and that grammatical rules are senseless, as they are concocted arbitrarily and perpetuated pointlessly.""The Language Instinct"" launches from the deep structure linguistic theory of Pinker's MIT colleague, Noam Chomsky, to suggest that language is indeed hard wired in the brain but that it is also learned, evolving over millennia and differentiating through forces of mutation, heredity, and geographical isolation.The book reviews the function of phonemes, morphemes, words, sentences, and alphabets with a good portion examining syntax and semantics in combination. The insights a casual reader will gain from this book will result only from a careful, sometimes painstaking, study of Pinker's dense prose, which he often peppers with humor."
4,beautifully written,"I'm sorry I can't offer a better opinion on the accuracy of this book, which did seem to have something of an agenda when I read it. I'm not a linguist. I did find it an interesting read, though, and it challenged me to think about the topics raised.(Since I read eclectically in many topics but am ""expert"" in few, I'm used to taking books with a grain of salt. It's not a bad practice, especially if you can't run the book by several real experts.)That aside--I'd be tempted to hand this book to an English class as a lesson in *style.* Content aside, Pinker's writing is entertaining and lovely. Which probably isn't the purpose he was looking to accomplish, but hey. I wish more books were written this way (with much importance given to the content, OC--but good content doesn't *have* to preclude good style)."
4,I made me think about thinking,I'm not a linguist or a psychologist and I have to admit that my knowledge in this area of science is pretty limited. I cannot judge Pinker's book on it's content but on how it has helped me in my day to day job. I'm a data architect in an international consulting firm. My day to day work is to translate what the business rules are into data structures that can support the computer systems build around them. My biggest problem has always been translating what am I hearing from the business community into a coherent set of rules that can be implemented using current database technology. Now that I understand a little more on how people think (At least I has been led believe that I got a little smarter after reading this book)and how people communicate what they think my job has become a little easier and more effective.
1,Pinker has got it all wrong,"Pinker is on an evolutionary bend when it comes to the human brain and after reading him and other linguists I must disagree with him. The brain is ""plastic"" and does not consist of specific modules for specific responses. It is disturbing that a prominent figure like him is involved with this pseudo-scientific ""evolutionary psychology"" that celebrates ""everything natural"" , reinforces gender stereotypes, and justifies the status quo."
3,Mediocore,"I was expecting an amazing text, that would help me understand language acquisition. It is a very difficult read, and I had a hard time learning from Pinker.. The text long enough."
3,"Fast service, poor quality.","Received this product really fast, but the front cover of the book was missing, otherwise the book appears to be good."
2,This is wit?,"Perhaps it's a brilliant overview pushing speculation as fact, but I stopped reading after the introduction and skimming the first chapter. I found it confusing, dull, and hardly fun. I also suspect that more people own than read this book - and that a majority of readers are simply fulfilling classroom assignments. How many people want to exchange their precious free time to struggle with this difficult text?"
2,"""Mentalese"" does not a perspective make!","How'd you like that grammar, Mr. Pinker? Perhaps you'd like to analyze it for me. If you did, I still don't think you'd understand what I meant. That's the problem - the brain doesn't create language, it processes language. You don't understand the sun by studying the things it shines its light on."
1,Awful (although English literature people might like it),"I take it I'm allowed to comment without having read more than a quarter of it. I found it utterly boring. I couldn't read it. The author works at a ""Center for Cognitive Neuroscience"", but this is in no way neuroscience, nor any science. It's a load of dusty old linguistics. It chats into other material at times, but that's the core. It has some cursory reports on psychological experiments, but it doesn't argue systematically with them. Looks like the chapters I didn't read are riddled with speculations about evolution."
5,I only wish the book was here when I studied linguistics.,"A very thorough and thought provoking book. As a former linguistics student, I can honestly say that it would have been very useful to me when I studied linguistics at the Univ. of Alberta in Canada. Pinker can clarify complex subjects like few other people. Congrats Prof. Pinker for a well written and useful book."
4,an interesting take on language and learning,"The idea of an innate human understanding of language is pretty controversial in academic circles so don't take this without a grain of salt, but... I found Language Instinct very readable, and full of excelent examples. In particular the discussion of pidgin vs. creole languages and how quickly fully gramatical languages show up even when no ""teacher"" is available is striking. It definitely makes you think about the changes that take place in young brains as they pick up language cues, as well as, the seeming universals in the variety of those languages. Pinker ends with a more speculative discussion of how the brain may be thought of as a set of interacting problem solving tools, evolved over millions of years."
3,No real page numbers in Kindle version - Update,"The description of this product on Amazon includes the statement, ""Contains real page numbers"". However, on opening this book, I find only ""locations"".Update: The real page numbers showed up. Apparently, the book had not finished synching, or something. I did notice that now the part of the book before page 1 has only locations, but I was well into the first chapter when I first noticed there were no page number. Then, just now, I looked down at the page line and saw a page number. Going back to the beginning, I now see page numbers. I am sure I wasn't asleep!"
1,At least he was right about mentalese!,"It's a good high level overview, especially of the Chomskyan revolution (and who wants to read Chomsky?) Pinker does a disservice in presenting speculation as fact, but in this he is just being faithful to the dominant scientific-philosophical paradigm. I bought the hardback in 1995, but couldn't bear to read it until recently. His explanation of how the brain is a Turing information processor, without invoking the homunculus, is particularly egregious. BUT: He is right about mentalese. The operations of consciousness are rule-governed, like a grammar. It has nothing to do with biology but everything to do with the structure of consciousness. Since Fodor is unreadable, Pinker is a good entry point to the discussion of mentalese, which everyone should understand. Pinker would be a good writer for the Economist or similar serious magazine, but must be taken with a large grain of salt otherwise."
3,Who's it?,"Haven't read the book, but wanted to add to the substantive discussion.In playing a game of tag as a child, didn't you ever ask, ""Who's it?"""
4,It's an introduction for most.,"For someone who has spent a great deal of time studying linguistics, psychology and neuroscience, this book is quite trivial. However, it brings to the table some intriguing thoughts that most don't contemplate. Language is inherently interesting in that everyone uses it, but few think about it. The beginning of The Language Instinct is mostly a Linguistics 101 review, but without reviewing those necessary principles, one is unable to reach further into the theories. The book was well put together, thought provoking and entertaining. I appreciate seeing a book that allows more than a small population of academics to engage in theoretical thought. Knowledge is for the masses."
4,"Opened My Eyes, I mean Ears","Before reading this book, I knew nothing about language or the brain's ability to process speech. I went into reading this book as a blank slate and I was blown away by the concepts and ideas. It gave me so much to think about and made me reevaluate the way I think about human instinct. If you already have an imdepth knowledge of speech and language development this may not be the book for you. It seems like it would be a bit basic for experts, but a novice like me soaked it up and enjoyed most of its contents. The book got a bit dry during some parts and a bit more detail and examples than I felt I needed, but it is my only crtisism. After reading this book I bought a copy for a Friend of mine. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,"Sparkling with wit, the way science should be presented.","Pinker has a compelling argument to make, and he makes it well. Mixing wit and anecdote with controlled experiments, Pinker writes with a clear and enjoyable voice, while never losing sight of the science.He starts with Chomsky, but this is not a rehash of old news. In fact, Pinker takes the ball and runs with it, giving Chomsky moral Darwinian support just where he needs it.Aside from a perplexing respect for Barbra Streisand, his conclusions are logical and precise.This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to know more about the world in which we live, and and a good read as well."
1,DANGER swich your class!,"This book, was obviously written by brilliant people. Unfortunately knowing mathematics does not mean you qualify for writing a book or being a teacher. Swokowski and Cole and the entire aid staff obviously have no real world teaching experience whatsoever. This book is written in pure mathematical theory, not english. I heave heard of leaning by immersion, but drowning the student in pure theory-talk without introducing it, extreme application problems, and a lack of clear cut ..anything, does not force the students to learn through struggle, it basically just overwhelms them into despair. The solution manual is a must, if you want a basic grasp of any of the presented concepts.Look, if you can avoid using this book, please do so, at any cost. If you can't, then you need to move in with a tutor. Also, take the time to yell at your institution. You shouldn't be paying them to waist your time with this poor material.Makes a great fix for a coffee table :D."
1,terrible and hard,"although my math skill is not the best, i have been pretty successful throughout my math courses, but this book just threw me off courses. It discusses alot of ireevelent topics, then jump into total new topics. Very confusing"
1,I m a good student.,"Let me first tell you that I got an A in Intermediate Algebra and another A in trigonometry. This textbook is ridicuosly riddled and puzzled, I read the example, and tried to follow the hard complicated question in the example. And I can tell you from heart, it is hard. I m sure the other precalculus textbooks aren't like this. Because I did some problem in the Sullivan precalculus textbook, which was easy and fun to do! I don't care if this publisher or author makes the material hard. I just hope it teaches me step by step with easy sentence that anybody can understand. Good thing that I have the student manual, or else I don't know where I'll be. Please, as an A student, I advice you professors or student to not use this textbook. Thank you."
2,good but not good,"the speed @ which i received the book was great, the book was great in great condition too but i didn't get the correct edition."
1,Horrible Just Plain Horrible,"I've just started using this book, by which I mean I'm only in the sixth chapter, and I have to say it is a nightmare to use. I spend over an hour trying to decipher the lessons in the book, only to have to give up and run problems until I can figure out what they are trying to teach me how to do. This is not due to me being bad at math either, as math is my best subject.To further make my point, at the beginning of the book, around the first ten lessons, I already knew how to do the problems they where trying to teach, able to solve the problems easily and show others how to do the same, yet I still could not make heads or tales of their lessons.Please, if you are a professor, do not force this horrible math book on your students.-Samantha Rogers"
1,TERRIBLE BOOK!,"If you have to buy this for a college class, then your are stuck. But if you learning precalculus on your own, stay away from this book! First, the book lacks clarity. You are left wondering what's going on. Secondly, no thoroughness. It supposedly 'teaches' a section then you are off to the next. Lastly, it dives into 'heavy' and sometimes irrelevant material, making the student feel lost. Not sure what's going on with this book? I got all As in Math -- This book is terrible!"
3,"If you're into math, this is for you","I'm currently enrolled in an Honors Precalculus course using this book. As the first 4 or 5 chapters are purely review from Algebra, even we students in an HONORS class are in danger of failing. The author of this book takes the term ""hard math"" to a whole new level. I have always excelled at math, and this class has provided me with my first-ever C+. Could it be the book's fault? Or is it the teachers? I think the book is fine, as the regular precal classes (who use the same book) are doing just splendidly. I doubt that this book is worth using unless you're very math-oriented; and if it weren't for the solution manual, I don't know where I'd be."
2,Room for improvement.,I have a BS in mathematics and I found this book---both as a student and as a tutor---to be less-than helpful for calculus preparation.
1,Precalculus: Functions and Graphs,"This book is horrible!! The explanations are needlessly wordy and don't do much to improve my understanding of math. Also, the homework is poorly designed: instead of building each new problem on older ones, everything is a scattered mess. Professors, please don't use this book just because you know Swokowski has been writing textbooks forever and he's the standard you're used to. I'm a GOOD student and I can safely say that this book is worthless."
1,Bad learning medium...,this book is terrible at teaching the material for each section. the examples are too simple and basic that they do not compare to the problems listed inside the book....if it wasn't for the extra tutoring at my school i don't know how i will pass my class with only this book
2,bleh,"The person who wrote the first comment for this book was exactly correct. Another thing worth noting that runs along the same lines is that the examples do not prepare you for problems that follow. The problems which are demonstrated are signifficantly easier. For instance the book might show you how 1+1=2, yet you are expected to problems such as (4/2)+(3/6)=?."
4,The title says it all,"Touching movie. It made my eyes filled with tears when I see the cruelty of war. No matter what side you're on, it must be heartwrenching to see the suffering that the Vietnamese people had to endure and the destruction of a beautiful country. Given it was made more than 30 years ago, I think the movie was excellently filmed and directed."
4,Sturdy apron,"The colors are great and the fabric is sturdy, however, ironing is absolutely required after washing. I love it and use it all the time."
5,So worth the money,"We bought this stroller and wore it into the ground with daily sidewalk trips, many many planerides and gate-checks, folding and unfolding it constantly...it went for a year and a half before it broke. Then we went cheap with a Graco (big mistake...with our heavy use that lasted maybe a month). Next I tried to save a LITTLE money with a side-by-side Peg Perego, but the basket on that thing is useless, and though it lasted about a year, that's still 6 months less than the Inglesina. Now I have to buy a side-by-side yet again, and I'm going back to the Inglesina. (Though it's horrifying, how much time and money I've put into stroller-buying over the years!)"
3,A Hemetemisic Vomitoria of Salvific Efficacy,"I'm about halfway through this book. It is useful and extremely interesting. The problem is that you have to ignore the writing to get to the meaning. The writing is that of a pompous dandy. I find myself taken out of the book over and over again to reflect upon why a writer would chose to construct a sentence in such a manner. I think if a book is constantly causing you to ask yourself whether the author is an obnoxious windbag or if you are just stupid, the writing has failed. That is definitely the case here. I give the book three stars - 5 for content and -2 for having to suffer through its pomposity."
3,better than average but,it's not touching what Q did with the Brothers Johnson.not by a long shot. still it has a charm about it.
1,Kimberley is a dud,Playboy Video Centerfold Kimberley Conrad is 55 minutes long. This video is divided into two parts. Kimberley covers forty-four minutes of the video and that is forty-four minutes too long. Kimberley sucked in her own video. She is totally nude for only four minutes of the forty-four minutes. Most the time we get a guided tour of the Playboy Mansion. It is any wonder how Kimberley Conrad became Playboy Playmate of the Year for 1989. Playboy represents nudity and here is a Playmate that is afraid to show it; granted there were a very few topless scenes. The other eight minutes are dedicated to Candy Loving; Playboy's Playmate of the Month for January 1979 and 25th Anniversary Playmate. Her Playboy shoots are very sexy. Playboy Video Centerfold Kimberley Conrad gets what it deserve an E-.
1,something sad about this...,"I thought this was a fun read some years back..well-written..hence my first inclination to give it 2 stars, but taking another look..if a man ever wrote about his ""repulsion"" over sex with an overweight woman, the way Robin describes sex with Michael, we'd be taking to the streets in protest...there was such an unkindness to it..and this was a woman with a dear, overweight friend...I'm changing my mind..back to one star..too much shallow emphasis on looks, money, etc..it's not a race thing..it makes all women look bad. Well, maybe just these women..I'd like to think some of us are different."
4,I waited to this moment,"I like this book because i find it very funny and interesting. I like it because in a sense that you can relate to it. The story is about four women pretty much have same problems which is searching to the right man to come into thier lives, someone who can take care of them and tell them that everything will be alright. One character also gets divorced and get very and angry because the husband wants to marry a white bookkeeper. I would recommend this book for those who likes to read romantic and adventure book."
1,A Great Book.......,"if you love lousy writing. Terry Mcmillan's books are a tribute to illiteracy and bad taste. I have no problem with the basic premise: 4 female friends trying to find as fulling a relationship with men as they have with each other. However I felt like I was watching a talk show rather than reading a novel. There's nothing wrong with using the vernacular of the day as part of the story (see Zora Neal Hurston's ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"") but McMillan displays an utter lack of writing and storytelling skills. Waiting to Exhale is to good writng like Jerry Springer is to good TV: it's simple-minded, moronic, and popular."
4,The never ending termoil of four middle age women's lives.,"This book was awesome, for it revealed the truth about black women dealing with everyday life. Being a single parent in most of the characters cases really is hard, and Terry McMillan did a wornderful job in protraying how it actually is to be a black women raising a family by herself. And a black woman being single in the 90's can be very difficult, because that individual knows what she wants, finding that man is an adverture in it's self. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to see how a black women deals with typical life situation concerning the male gender."
4,Summer Reading 3,Purchased several good books to read over the summer. Did not to watch a bunch of reruns on TV.
3,"Four friends, four viewpoints","'Waiting to Exhale' by Terry McMillan is a novel that lets the reader see through the eyes of four friends, and it cultivates four very different viewpoints. Savannah falls for all the wrong guys, but knows when to leave. Robin falls for all the wrong guys too, she just doesn't care, because she has this need for a man in her life. Bernadine is struggling with the news that her husband is leaving her for a young, attractive, white girl, and Gloria is still afraid of the dating game, having never been really in it in the first place. However, they still manage to keep their senses of humour intact, and keep the reader laughing along with them to the end. Can't wait to see the movie."
4,an African American Big Chill,"I think MacMillan is a terrifically entertaining writer. Her dialogue is hilarious and her characters, though sometimes a bit clueless, are certainly endearing. I find this book deeper than How Stella got Her Groove back, but don't expect Dickens. She's a sharp writer with a good eye for detail and dialogue who presents a fine portrait of upper middle class black women. As I said in my review of Stella, it's nice to see a positive economic/social representation of black women for a change rather than the cliched drug dealers and basketball players. These women are successful financially and are working on their social lives. She makes me laugh out loud at times thanks to her great sense of humor"
1,Gives women a bad name.,I did not like this book. The women in it are stupid fools at the beginning and stupid fools at the end.
4,We Aren't Exhaling We are Just Now Inhaling,Ohhhhhhh... that had to be the best book. It touches in all the right places. Anyone and everyone can relate. If you are pretty and can't find a man who can live up to your expectations or your man decides he wants a white woman. Or maybe it just plain ain't no one out there for you. These characters go through the exact same thing!
1,Very disappointing,"I really disliked this book. The message seemed to be: Without a man, you are nothing. The whole book was about these four woman trying to find men, as if there lives were meaningless without them. Everything else in their lives seemed to be secondary. I read it to the end, but had no compassion or interest in these women whatsoever. There wasn't one whose character I liked. They weren't even nice. A very disappointing read, and a very sad message."
1,Book on cassette tape...,"I ordered a CD, but cassette tapes of this book came... :( Since it is not worth it to go through the hassle of returning it, I threw it away. :("
2,"Read ""Mama"" Instead","McMillan's first novel, ""Mama,"" was real. ""Waiting to Exhale"" reads like a TV sit-com, with two-dimensional characters who have no sense of self-worth, who accept society's standards on what ""success"" is, and who are, I'm sorry to say, not at all interesting. Read ""Mama"" instead."
5,something our 18 month old and 3 year old can enjoy,"Our 3 year old typically watches Bob the Builder, World World, and Curious George. Our 18 month old likes music (think Barney and the Wiggles). I've been looking for a God-centered DVD that both our toddlers would enjoy. This DVD has catchy songs and teaches great principles. The production quality (audio and visual) is solid. I would suggest it to those with toddlers ages 4 or younger."
3,My toddlers love it but....,"My 2 year old and 3 year old both love this DVD. I however, find it very annoying. Boz sounds almost exactly like Barney!! I was looking for a good show for toddlers that talked and taught a lot about Jesus and I just don't think this is the one. Like I said the girls do like it but it's not what I was looking for them."
5,Replaced Blue's Clues as Favorite,"My son LOVES Blue's Clues - but after one viewing of Boz he's hooked - he actually threw a fit when we put Blue's Clues in instead of Boz! Yeah, it is a little Barneyish - but I'm one of the mom's who actually liked Barney, so the sweet positive outlook of the program and the catchy little tunes are quite welcome in my home. My son (he's 2) has been looking all over the house to help Granny find her lost purple gardening glove, finds shapes around the house, and has been searching the sky for rain. I think we'll keep this video around for quite a while."
5,Top-opening carriers are the best,"I work in cat rescue in addition to having several of my own. The top-opening carriers are favored by anyone working in rescue, and by the vet offices. Getting a scared cat into a carrier is so so much easier with the top-opening carrier. You can hold the kitty and while it is calm just put him down in through the top, with little stress. Everyone complains about trying to struggle to get a cat into the front, trying to upend the front opening to drop the cat into the small opening. I've given many away to rescue friends, to animal control officers. I keep losing them to people who love them and have to constantly buy more to replenish what I have on hand.I also work with wildlife and these are the best for transporting orphaned babies. It's easy to treat them from above and you can monitor, medicate and feed them from above, almost impossible with a front-opening."
1,Do not purchase this Routledge edition.,"This Routledge copy looks like it was printed with a hand-powered ditto machine from the 70s, replete with severed chapter headings and smeared ink. I contacted Routledge but they ignored my email. Too big and important to care? Go to a library and save your 150 bucks for a better product."
5,MARS Patrol,M.A.R.S. Patrol Total WarThis book is a collection of comics I read as a kid and that was along time ago. I was very happy with this book. it starts at the beginning of the war with a new Army from another World and the group of the military's best the kicks there behind. This book beings back all of my good childhood feelings. If you are a child of the 60s this book is for you. i give it 5 stars
2,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"I remember seeing the first issue of M.A.R.S. Patrol in my favorite drugstore, where I used to get all my comics. I was only about 10, then, and on a budget so it was a toss up between this comic and a Green Lantern.... G.L. won out, and I always wondered all those years what I missed. Well, now I found out, and I'm glad I picked the Green Lantern. Except for the Wally Wood art, the stories are so-so. Another problem is the reprinting - not so great. Colors looked washed out in some panels, and imaging isn't as sharp as it could be. Still, for the Wally Wood completist, this book is a must. Just wish it would have been better."
5,Lovely Little Bowls For Great Price,"*****I bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something---like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries---and we use them all the time. I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep.They are not thin, as a previous reviewer has noted. They are not thick or bulky either, though, just perfect. They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well. They almost look, well...elegant, which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price.The bowls come well-packaged, and although the price is very low, they definitely don't seem cheaply made. I haven't seen them in stores, either. Great buy!*****"
