4,Easy to install. Nice addition to a stock system.,"I bought this for my mom to install in her Eclipse Spider. It fit in the very tight trunk without issue. It came will all the wires needed to hook it up too. Sound quality is very nice, but don't expect it to set off any car alarms."
5,Love the Bass,"I am very happy with this subwoofer. It serves my needs quite well. I installed it in my 2001 Ford mustang- which has very little trunk space to begin with- but it worked out pretty well. I can use my trunk, but I am limited in the ability to put long or bulky items in my car. The sacrifice of space was worth it to me, since I love music, and adding a subwoofer really brings the music alive.I am in my 40's, so i don't need to blow out my speakers...but people do look my way at traffic stops...which makes me giggle...I had it installed at a big box store, and it lasted all of 15 minutes for the installer."
4,Good for small vehicles only,"Hooked it up myself, took about an hour to wire everything up. It was straight forward and no problems. The bass is of good quality for the unit. I'm not really good at tunning the sound but it seems a little boomy sounding. It might be because of how I set it up or because it's only a 10"" sub. For the price you cant really beat it for an all in one package. Lets hope it last I dont listen to a lot of hard hitting bass stuff so it's still running after 6 months of use."
5,Great sound in minivan.,"Got one for christmas. fills the Odyssey with musical bass. very well thought out, has adjustable crossover, bass boost adjustment, gain and a phase shifter to have a chance to tune to your space, and a remote volume control. PLUS it is servo controlled to prevent distortion. all in one solution, just add wires.well worth the money and effort to install. pumped out hours of great bottom end on the road trip to mexico."
1,don't wase your time,After about a year it stopped working the red lite is on but no auto turn on. The remote turn on wont function either. It is a nice unit when it worked but I would pass. On line you can see lots of problems like this.
1,jesse,very upset bought this item and got it installed at a very reputable company and was very embarrassed when they told me that this product was not working left there very Mad.:-
1,misleading availability status,"This Infinity Basslink 200 sounds like a great system. The problem is Amazon is presently showing they are available the same as they did when I ordered it on Dec 20. But right after I ordered it, the confirmation email I received said it was out of stock and they'd email me when it is shipped. It still has not shipped, but the product status still says available. Totally misleading."
4,It works.,"I didn't expect too much from this unit but I got what I expected and that's a good thing.It was a little difficult to tune and I have to use the subs volume control infrequently on different songs but it gives me just the small hit of bass that my 6.5 in. components get down to, so I like that. I'm not a big bass head but it's got to be there."
4,Going on two years now,I have had this sub for two years now its my second one. The first one did not get grounded very good and it fried it so I sent it back to Infiniti they replaced it and I haven't had a problem since. I used to run two 10 inch jbl before some lowlife piece of sh#t thought they needed to steal them. This sub doesn't compare to the jbls but you still get some good bass out of it.
3,Didn't make it through the warranty period.,"10 Months after purchase the unit stopped working. To make matters worse, they are honoring the warranty, but Harman is backordered on this unit, so it'll be approximately 5 weeks before my replacement is returned. In the meantime, I'll be off to Craigslist for a temporary solution.I like the feature of the remote volume and auto on/off feature. One word of caution though if using the auto on/off with the speaker level inputs - If you close the door or trunk in your car, your car speakers can act as microphones, turning the subwoofer on and accentuating road noise if you drive with the levels up and your stereo off. My levels are set relatively low, so although the unit does turn on, feedback in not an issue.The unit sounds clean and tight when working. Don't expect license plate rattling bass from this unit, but it does provide the low fill that my factory unit was lacking. If not for reliability this unit would be 4 stars+++."
3,Poorly Sewn,Fits Samsung phone that it's supposed to but it's quite cheap looking. In this case you get what you pay for.
4,Good Rules for Specific Styling,"I was looking for some basic good advice for smart, clean interior design aesthetics...this book met those standards in a beautiful and sensitively assembled book. My only criticism is that the styling that Kelly shows is a high design with contemporary attributes - not very relevant to many other kinds of decorating challenges. I have an early 1900s home with standard ceilings, wood trim and smallish rooms - not very similar at all to Kelly's gorgeous and mostly spacious examples. I will have to work a little harder to envision the golden rules being applied to my humble abode."
4,A great book filled with tips for the novice,"I would not consider myself to be a designer or decorator, but I do enjoy style and try to bring that high-end look to my own home. Kelly's book has given me a lot of inspiration and she imparts a lot of good advice for the novice. Some very simple principles that have already helped me to see items through different eyes. The photographs are superb and give some great ideas, as well."
3,Getting Into the ACT,"This book is great, since it has real tests and strategies, but I would suggest only checking this out from the library, and not buying one, because there are other ways to get real ACTs. There is a little booklet about the ACT, what to bring and that sort of stuff with a real ACT test, and a way to get two more tests wich all-together cost only about 15 dollars. I would suggest using the Getting Into the ACT for just practice, to see how you would do on the ACT and the other tests with a time limit. Also, don't use just this book, use ACT for Dummies, or some other book to help you out too."
5,"Getting into the ACT: Official Guide to the ACT Assessment, Second Edition by ACT",Review material was what I had expected. The book was in excellent condition.
1,Newer edition available,"Once deemed the ""only"" official ACT guide, Getting Into the ACT has been replaced with a newer, more up-to-date version titled, ""The Real ACT Prep Guide"". The new guide comes complete with 3 real ACT exams and information on the new optional writing section."
5,The James Brown of Cajun Music has done it again!!,"Cedric Benoit-""The Originals""If you are looking for a great cajun album, pick this one up!!From ""sweet Suzanne"" to ""Cajun Dance"" you will explore a range of emotion once unheard of in the cajun-zydeco genre. This album is a must have that you will listen to for years to come."
4,The title says it all,"Sometimes you pick a book simply because of the title or because you have heard good things about the author. I picked this book for both reasons and have been impressed. The book really addresses all that the title suggests. A short, but great read."
4,Great content but a little dry,"The book is hard to read because it is so small! There is some good stuff in the book, but not worth buying it for the content. It seemed like a lot of generic stuff that most couples already know."
3,Lima,"A small book on the construction of steam locomotives at Lima in or around 1924. The book discusses each of the major shops involved in the construction and has a few B&W pictures of each shop from the period. The author also discusses some of the working conditions for the workers as well as the make up of the work force. The book is only 88 pages so you won't get an exhaustive reference work or large number of pictures. But, it is not a bad book if you want some good general info on Lima from the 20's. The majority of the pictures seem to be of 2-8-2 construction at the time, with one or two Shay's towards the back when they mention that separate shop. My local library was able to find me a copy to read."
2,danman,"not very strong bit, the 1/4 inch has already become rusted but for boring not manageable but not the best bits especially that it has the Bosch name on it could do better"
5,Great movie !,"My son is 2,5 and loves this movie. He watches it few times per week. That is one of the best movies I bought for him after ""Good night moon"" and ""The very hungry caterpilar"""
3,good education cartoon,"my little four year old, he watched it many times, and just loved it.it could use a little more eduction segments, otherwise it is good for the little ones."
5,Past and present Book of Mormon geography theories,"This book deals with the varoius proposed geographies of the Book of Mormon since its initial publication in 1830. Sorenson does an excellent job in showing the requirements of the Book of Mormon volume and the antiquity of a limited geography model among Latter-day Saints, contra critics who claim it is nothing short of a construct by Sorenson from the 1980s and a Mormon tactic to ""protect"" the Book of Mormon from alleged archaeological problems.Sorenson also does an excellet job in showing that the geography required by the Book of Mormon is quite limited, and the weaknesses involved in many theories, both hemispheric and some limited, that have been proposed by those interested in the Book of Mormon volume."
1,"Basic does not have to mean ""little content""","""Around the Buoys"" intends to be a primer on basic racing tactics.It is written as a narrative. I think that a more succinct format with diagrams and bullet point lists of tactical considerations and options would be more helpful for learning. Certainly nothing would be lost. A narrative format seems more appropriate for Walker, Melges, and Perry as they are covering advanced tactics, competitive psychology, and tuning.It does not have very much content. Even if one were to distill the tactical knowledge from the book, there would not be much.""Performance Racing Tactics"" by Bill Gladstone offered by North Sails is superior in its presentation and content for beginner racers. It also covers some more advanced topics, and would be valuable even to an accomplished racer."
1,Hard to Read,"I have never not finished a book, and I have to say this one was really hard to finish. Then to be totally disappointed at the end. Although I got the point I think the author was trying to make, it was just painful getting there.I thought Scarlett was an intelligent woman with a point to make to herself and others but to have her be treated like that from her ""Default Bestfriend"" (and that was annoying as well...who says that?) Then her relationship with Steve, there was no character basis on that relationship...they date all of 2 times and they are in love and met their perfect person. Not realistic, and hard to swallow. I would not recommend this book. I just hope the author's book A Think Pink Line is much better than this one!"
3,"I laughed, but overall found it average.","Little Change of Face has an interesting premise, but requires a lot of patience from its reader. I considered putting this book down many times, as it just takes a long time with its build-up. Once it finally gets into the thick of things, it held my attention better, but even then I never got a sense of ""I must keep reading!"" All and all, it's pretty anti-climactic and many of the characters are flat. That said, I'd still say it's a good read, which attests to the witty and fun skill of this author. I laughed out loud many times, yawned a couple, and by the end considered from a new perspective the issues of personal image and how it can cripple or bolster a person. It's worth the read if you have the time. Not bad for a long flight or a snow-in day. Skip it if your reading time is a precious commodity."
1,blah,"What a waste of my money!?I got about 80 pages in and decided to drop it.It was so boring and.... well, that's it. If it was anything more I would have kept reading it."
2,Fluff,"I would have found this excellent work for a fifteen-year old writer, but the author seems to be an adult. The story line's a little forseeable, the author spends a chapter building up to The Breasts, a chapter explaining The Breasts, and the chapter afterwards talking about others' views of The Breasts. Also annoying is the author's compulsive need to Capitalize Everything. She never gives one of the main characters (The Best Girlfriend) any name whatsoever, and gives a highly racist name (Token Black?!!) to another side character. All her bad characters had a name starting with P. (Pat, Pam) This author could have made this a funny, in depth search into what attracts people, but she skimmed the scummy surface of the worst chick lit possible instead."
4,Very Timely,This book comes at a critical time in our society- it has wonderful ideas and strategies that can be readily applied to school settings- forming partnerships with parents and teachers is especially helpful!
5,Character Matters is our school's book club selection.,"Our school's Site Based Team is in the process of doing something related to Dr. Lickona's book ""Character Matters"" that we think is exciting. Organized around the ""book club"" theme, we have been promoting the book as something we think is worth having parents and staff read. Since June of last year, we have sold close to 160 copies of the book; we also have a set of five available to borrow from the school library. This endeavor will culminate with an evening with Dr. Lickona in November, where he facilitates a book talk and takes questions from the audience. We're expecting in excess of 200 parents and educators in attendance, and are quite excited to see where this takes us in our character education initiative. As we were with his previous work, ""Raising Good Children"", we are indebted to Dr. Lickona for his commitment to promoting good character.Robert Storrier, PrincipalEnders Road Elementary School, Manlius, NY"
4,Towel Dispenser,"Product exactly as described, all metal (white) I am using multi-fold towels for small business bathroom use. Dispenses these towels nicely. Locking cabinet for those who need in a public environment. The small clear window to see qty of towels remaining is no use, too small and to low to the bottom of the cabinet, should have been larger window and a few inches higher on the cabinet to be practical. Overall very pleased with the purchase."
3,Easy Reading - Take with more than a grain of salt,"John Dean's many enemies didn't have to worry about discrediting him - his wife takes care of it in her self serving memoir.John Dean is Mo's third husband. When they first met he didn't bother telling her that he was still married to a wife he later divorced and throughout the book he treats her like dirt. Their falling in love is described in a sickeningly fairy tale way. And it only gets better. Mo does let John have his say and attack his enemies through her book - She hates whoever he hates so there is a repeat of the pettiness in blind ambition, particularly the attacks on John Ehrlichman and Jeb Magruder.I like this book because it is so ridiculous that it is humerous."
2,Dorman 520-134 Control Arm,"Cheap quality. After installing, a lot of weird noise is heard from the suspension when pushing the brake or during acceleration."
4,RIght on,"Just as expected. It's big and it blows air... Hey, it's ""Swiss""... what else needs to be said."
4,Finally,"After almost 30 years it's nice to have a new album from Kiss's front man. The album is very well put together and will keep Kiss fan's (like me)happy. It's also nice to have some new, good material from the someone in the band (unlike Gene Simmon's A**Hole album). Buy this album, it's definitely worth having."
5,Can't LIVE without it!,"I have to be honest when I say that Live to Win is my favorite CD. I'm sixteen years old and I've absolutely adored Paul since I was five.My favorite track on the CD is Loving You Without You, though each song is awesome!! I think every single person can relate to at least one or two songs on the album. The lyrics are what gets me the most. They all just make so much sense.The album overall is excellent and I guarantee you 110% that you will not be dissapointed if you pick it up (though I would've hoped you had it already!!) =)LIVE TO WIN!"
5,Excellent release with well-crafted songs!,"This CD has 'hooky', memorable tunes with great vocals! The legendary, influential, and unmistakable Paul Stanley is still 'at the top of his game' vocally, and it's great to see him still 'strutting his stuff', as strong as ever. It seems that just like fine wine, Paul Stanley just gets better with age! This CD has it all- excellent vocals, guitars, drumming, etc. In short, IT ROCKS!!!"
5,The Heart of Kiss,Paul is still relevant on this album. The songs are contemporary yet true to the best of what we expect from him in his Kiss personna. I completely disagree with other reviews that say this sounds like leftovers from the 80s. Paul is and always has been the musical heart of Kiss.
1,Live to WIN?? He LOST - BIG TIME!,This CD is a total waste of time and money! All the songs sound like 80's throw-aways! I was disappointed to hear this - because his 78 solo was so great - but this CD is just one giant TURD!
5,"Paul Stanley ""Live to win"" CD","CD was shipped in a very timely manner.Cd looked as if it had never been played.I got great service and an even better price.Thanks so much! Id definatly recomend these guys to anyone,anywhere.Very professional! Great products! Awesome service!!"
3,Ha podido ser mejor,"Ciertamente no esperaba una segunda parte del album solitario hecho por Paul en 1978, pero tampoco esperaba esto. El disco es muy escuchable, un disco promedio mas bien. Pero por dios!!! es Paul Stanley, no le veo la necesidad de copiar ideas de otra gente. Si escuchas el disco te daras cuenta que hay toques Evanecense Fallen entre otros. De verdad, son ellos que tienen que seguir a Paul, no Paul a ellos.!!!!!!!!"
2,Nothing special,"After hearing the title track on South Park a week or so before the release I thought this might be a pretty good album. I was wrong. Other than Live To Win, nothing stands out on this album."
2,Undeserved hype,"There was a lot of hyp because this was Stanley's first solo output in 28 years. But I'm sorry to say this: this album does not deliver.Of course it's immaculately produced, but the songs themselves are nowhere near ""great"" status... They have absolutely no discernible and catchy riffs... it's a wall of sound, sometimes sadely with nu-metal tones all around.I'll wait for his next solo release."
1,Falling real short,"Paul could've done way better than this. Live To Win is far too commercial and predictable. Totally done to please his radio-friendly crowd. This just isn't worthy of someone who wrote such songs as Tonight You Belong To Me, Together As One or Love In Chains on his first solo album. Also, Desmond Child is all over the songwriting which is a real let down as he's always been a terrible influence on Paul musically. He isn't someone who could help things here, and the album goes from bad to worse as Paul tries too hard to please, going from one silly trend to the next."
4,Paul just gets better with age!,"I saw Paul at House of Blues this past month--one of the best live experiences of my life! The album is great, but with some songs that fall short of Paul's amazing songwriting talent. ""Live To Win"", ""Lift"", and ""Wake Up Screaming"" are some great tracks! Kudos, Paul!"
3,"Not bad, not great","Pros:Not more of the same from the Kiss camp, not what you would expect from PS. Good surprize!Good productionBetter that a lot of the new rock music hitting the airwavesGene Simmons's last record is horrible by my standards( No Gene, I did not waste money on it, je, je, je )Great vocal performancesCons:The songs are not HIS. He is more of a performer that a singer, songwriterNu Metal at 55 year years???? I mean, PS can do whatever he wants but it is not credible.It is always good to hear from PS. Lets see if PS will make a PS record but in between thank you for the music."
2,Dreary Recitation,After being a huge Kiss fan for many years and enjoying a number of live concerts and albums this I am afraid to say is not flash. Stanley appears a little lost and without any real spark and unlike earlier albums there is no song to save the day on this album.The entire album is easily forgotten and you wonder at the end if you missed something. The vocals are down on the excitement levels just adding to the general feeling of disappointment of the album.Given the chance again.... I would not buy this.
2,Flat,"Paul Stanley is the most melodic and consistant songwriter in Kiss. His efforts and craft resulted in some of Kiss's finest moments and left us with some classic songs. Paul Stanley has always been a consumate professional and rock purest more dedicated to music than any of the other members. His solo album in 1978 showcased his impressive vocal range and stellar songwriting chops.This latest release is similar to that 1978 release. It shows us Stanley can still sing and write catchy pop/rock songs. However, there is no bite here, no edge. It is too slick and polished and flat. The other members of Kiss provided the edge and rawness that is missing in this solo effort. However liberating it is for Paul to be able to play without Ace, Gene and Peter, even he must notice that without chemistry the outcome falls flat. In other words, without smoke there probably isn't much fire..Choice cuts: ""Wake Up Screaming"" and ""Its Not Me"""
4,"Strong, but contrived","This is a short album: 10 songs. They are all good rock songs--and the ballad (""Everytime I see you around"") could be a top 10 hit. This album is NOT as original or as strong as Paul's first solo album. While Paul told us this would be a highly personal album, it somehow lacks heart. He has a good, strong voice (always had), but sometimes the strength doesn't seem to come from down deep. And, sometimes, he actually screams. . .well. . .he screams out of tune. This album will fade with time and leave no lasting memories except to those of us who are die-hard Kiss/Paul fans. Ironically, I thought Gene's album was more original. It is nice to see two new solo albums from the two remaining (founding) members of Kiss. Paul is the last of a dying breed. He is the last of the classic Rock Gods. I wasn't disappointed in the album--I just think my expectations were too high for having waited 23 years."
5,Return of the Starchild!,"Paul Stanley is one of the most overlooked vocalist, songwriterand performer in rock n' roll history. This long awaited follow-upto his 78 fantastic solo album was worth the wait. It's not a KISSalbum! so all of you who expected Love Gun are probably not happy.It seems Paul put a lot of effort and love into this album everysong has something to offer if your a fan or even if your not a fanof KISS. Songs like the Live to Win and LIft are very fresh and Paul'svocals are just a good as ever. My favorite tracks are Wake up Screamingand It's Not Me and sound like hit singles to me. Of course the lovesongs are there and nobody sings them better. So chill out and sit backand just take in each song and be happy that Paul is still making goodmusic because they're ain't much out there anymore! Buy it!"
1,It's really negative 5 stars,"This is so bad it hurts!Listen carefully to the previews, if you like bubblegum pop compliments of Desmond Child but out of key ... you will like it. I myself did not! You can have it ... free !"
1,yuk,"The reason I gave this 1 star is that this will not let me give it none.I thought the hair band poser rock era was over.This cd is the lamest thing to come along since.....ah,let's see.......KISS. You could not pay me to listen to this again.Give it up stanley,you got your millions.Just go away and let us forget the last nightmare."
5,An old Paul Stanley fan,"I actually just found out about this disc about a week ago. I bought it kind of on a whim - I had adored Stanley back in the 80s with KISS, and also back up into the 70s. But I thought his voice had deteriorated by 1988 with ""Crazy Nights"" and lost interest in the band. But his 1978 solo album remains in the top 20 of my 700-disc collection.This disc is just amazing. I really never thought, however much I loved him, that he could come up with a disc like this. I learned about a year ago that he actually had been the Phantom of the Opera in the ALW show in Toronto at the end of its run there (circa 1999).This album...he's in his element, and it's amazing. If you were a fan of the Paul Stanley songs from KISS in the 70s and early-mid 80s, you've GOT to get this disc. I can't believe how impressed I am."
3,Gotta Love Paul,"Well, being a forever Kiss fan, its hard to give an unbiased review of their work. This cd was fun. Of course, I love Paul Stanley's vocals. Paul sounds like he just went into the studio to have fun, and he did. His style is a bit different from the Traditional Kiss sound. I enjoyed his music and I hope he continues to grow as a solo artist. Rock On Kids!!!"
3,Who steers the ship through the stormy seas?,"Hate to say it but this sounds generic, somewhat like the equally disappointing ""Carnival of Souls"". Lyrics have never been Pauls strongsuit so I guess that's why he always ""collarborates"" (ie, they write the songs, he performs them) but even still the way the lines are said seem very impersonal as though being sung by someone whose heart is not in it.Paul still sounds great but like the Crazy Nights-esque cover art implies; better days have passed. I can't say NOT to buy this but don't over expect. Out of the Kiss solo albums, Pauls was my favorite and while this is FAR FAR better than Genes last abomination it rates nowhere near true Kiss. I mean, ""Live to Win""? Does it get any more simplistic than that?"
4,great tunes,I gave this as a requested gift and I am assured it's a great cd for Paul Stanley (KISS) fans.
4,Starchild vs. Crotchcreature= Starchild wins,Great solo CD that captures both the sound and spirit of KISS long after I had given up on hoping for anything new from Kiss. Wonderful set of songs! I especially like Lift and Where Angels Dare.Starchild lives.
4,PAUL SHOWS HE HAS SOUL,"I remember owning Paul's solo album, along with the other three, back in the early eighties and remembering how his seemed to have its own genre. Paul Stanley is an outstanding artist and seemed to have been shadowed in the demon wings of his counterpart. What I really admire is the professionalism this album shows vs. Gene's last solo effort. This proves Paul puts us (the fans) first and wants to deliver an album that can be played in repeat. I have always had the ear for a chart topper, and ""LIFT"" definitely is a chart topper. It seems to bring you back to a good KISS ballad from the eighties but with Paul's touch."
1,Have you seen Mr. Eisen's paintings? Not too bad,"I wish I could just give an asterisk instead of a star for this record. I just don't get it. Can't listen to it, can't get through it, can't own it. Makes me think Nickleback, All American Rejects, and Five for Fighting are pretty good bands. I hate those bands. Paul, sit down at a piano, try something else, this ain't happenin anymore."
2,Live To Win - Review,"I bought this CD without hearing it first, as I'm a heavy Kiss fan. The music is lite to rock middle of the road. Especially when comparing it to the music of Kiss.Th lyrics are bland not and very catchy, all in all, it's an average effort. I really expected a lot more from the rock legend Paul Stanley.I think two stars is also a bit generous it's more like 1.5 stars and certainly won't win any awards."
3,"Good, but not Jewell's Best","Reading Lisa Jewell is my ""guilty pleasure"". I'm a BIG fan. If you like ""chick lit"", especilly with a British flavor, then Jewell is your girl. This book however, is not her best; just her longest. And that's the problem. She should have cut this book in half. The story's a good one, but not one that needed 503 pages to tell. Waaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Read any of her other books first and leave this one for last."
4,very cute book,"i liked this book a lot. the characters were well thought out and the story was sweet. not too predictable, and i was sad when i was done with the book, as i could not put it down. great read!"
4,Alpha Charlie,Alpha Charlie has mixed together an awesome blend of music that will apeal to many people of many different musical backgrounds.The members of Alpha Charlie are very talented guys with alot to offer the music sceen. This debut album is just a piece of what these boys have for fans.So no matter what kind of music you love make sure your collection isnt with out this CD. You wont regret it.
2,Dissapointed...,"I did a lot of research on this camera before I bought it as a replacement for my FujiFilm 4800Z, which I liked very much, and was sure I had found a nice replacement for my wife to use. However, I was very disappointed with the sharpness and clarity of the pictures. I had to return the camera to Amazon. I am not sure if this was a defective camera, but all the shoots were a little bit blurry.... I guess I will have to start my search all over again..."
1,Fuji fails to honor warrantee - Don't buy from them,Fuji fails to honor warrantee - Don't buy from themDo NOT buy the Fuji digital camera. They charged me $[...] for a fix within the warrantee period. Their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears. Rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee.[...]
5,Fast! Fast! Fast! And it takes GREAT pictures too!!!,"PROs:Fast! Fast! Fast! And it takes GREAT pictures too!!!I love it! A real eye-turner (lots of compliments). I like the dial which a separate setting for scenes (like natural light-no flash) and manual. It does really well at night, has ISO 1600.I really like the software which transfers the photos to my pc. It has many options; I have it configured so I just enter a directory name and it automatically copies the photos, creating that directory under `my photos', then deletes the photos off my card, ready for next time.I really like using [...] You can charge the battery while it is in the camera (unlike my Nikon 7900 which my partner just purchased). I like my Fuji much better.Cons:Not a big one, but it uses a proprietary cable so one connection to the camera, then power, usb & audio plug into that.Bottom line: Love it!"
2,unreliable-fatal breakdown only 1 month after warranty expired!,"The title says it all: one month the warranty expired, the zoom feature on the camera broke, making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on. The camera is all but useless. The Fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly, at a cost of at least US$120; for that price, I'm buying a new camera, but not another F10."
4,Best little camera I've ever owned,"I've been using this little camera for over 5 years and it has taken amazing pictures for me over the years. I had liked it so much, I bought a little larger Fuji Camera shortly after and found the battery life was sucked away by the bigger screen and lacked the natural light setting the F10 had. Just yesterday the telescoping lens stopped functioning and I will really miss not having it. But as great as it was, It was past its prime because newer digital cameras have more advanced features and image stabilization which the F10 lacks. I will by another Fuji I think if I can find a decent successor to the the F10."
1,Bad Camera,I ordered a refurbished one. Took a first few pictures. They all turned out awful. Too bad I had to return it and get a refund. Bad one!
3,Fuji F10 good camera but needs new charger and battery,"The Fuji F10 seems like a good camera so far but the charger they included had a European adapter so won't work in the USA, and the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge long. The seller should have said that. So I need to buy a new battery charger and maybe a battery. Also, the camera had sticky substance on part of it I had to wipe off with a damp cloth."
3,fujifilm camera and seller review,"The product is good quality and seems to be performing well. The product was shipped within a reasonable time. It did however come poorly packaged, e.g. without protective packing materials around the item. The order was missing a described memory card initially.The seller was reachable by both email and phone, and he did respond to my concern about the missing card. When I did receive the memory card some time later, it was one that had even more memory than he had said he would provide. Overall, I ended up feeling pretty satisfied with the product and the seller."
5,Terrific Camera....Reliable!,"I bought two of these for my grandkids when they were on sale for $139. No problems upon receipt, worked like a charm right out of the box. Technically (eg, shutter speed) much better than my Olympus, you can't go wrong even at a much higher price. The kids are thrilled. It's been several months now, the cameras are rock solid."
1,is kind of good....but the price is too high......,"As a student at Fresno city college, our intruction use this book and I feel that the book cost too much becuase most of the student cannot afford. Please lowered the price so every student will the book and get the knowlege to share."
5,We love Frances!,"My husband's family grew up on the recordings of the Frances stories, read by Glynis Johns (sp). Entertaining for children and adults alike!"
2,not something I will use often,"I use the Frances books in my classroom and the children enjoy the ""read-aloud"" versions that I have on audio tapes. I ordered this cd as a supplement, as I do not have all the books on tape. The children and I did not like this version and I probably will not use them in my classroom. The other version of the books (read-aloud) is much better."
4,Frances Audio Collection,"My 6 year old son loves the Francis stories, even though he is usually more attracted to stories like Henry Huggins, or Mouse Tales; etc. However, he was a bit put off by the change in narrators between the Francis audio collection and a different Francis tape and book. The audio collection employs an older English lady with a rather coarse voice for it's narration.He wrinkled his nose and said ""who's that""? when listening for the first time. I think he prefers the pleasant voice narration on ""A Bargain for Francis"", and some other Francis selections."
1,Utter Trash!,"This is complete junk! Do not believe the hype of the other reviewers. They are his friends and cohorts. Talk about pretenious and condescending music! Please go get a real job you no talent hack! I wish I could leave a ZERO star rating but Amazon is too kind. That write up was done by the ""artist"" so you can count on it being complete Bull! Please whatever you do don't waste your hard earned cash on this ""music"". Go out and buy a Britney Spears record. At least she's nice to look at."
2,Buy this if you like Sammy Hagar at his worst.,"Somebody donated a copy of this CD to my college radio station, so I listened to it once. Its kind of dull. Every song sounds like a Sammy Hagar outtake."
5,Great reading,This is the first book I've read by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters were believeable and the story held my interest. I finished reading the book in 2 days. I'm on to the second in the series.
2,not very good,"This was the first book that I read by Cindy Gerard. It barely kept my interest. I didn't really like either of the main characters and felt that nothing really backed up the feelings behind their relationship. I mostly skimmed it after the first few chapters because it couldn't keep my interest.However, I just read some of the Black Ops stories and they're pretty good. Now I'm going back and reading some more of the bodyguard book. I just finished Jase's story and it's so much better than this first book in the series. I would recommend skipping this and at least checking out Jase's story and the Black Ops books, especially Johnny's story."
3,Pretty decent,"Jillian a TV anchorwoman has been receiving death threats and her father calls in Nolan Garrett to be her bodyguard. The beginning of the book started out great. Then the book slid into mainly centering on the attraction between the two characters. It took most of the book before the two main characters decided whether or not they wanted to get involved. There wasn't a lot of action and most of the book centered around the romance. I expected the book to contain more suspense and on the edge of your seat action, but unfortunaltely it did not. However, for the most part it kept my attention and I would be willing to read the next in the series."
4,Excellent,"I bought this for my flight the other day, and let's just say it never made it to the plane. From the moment I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. I absoultely loved it. Very good romance novel. I can't wait to read more!"
2,A bit boring,"This book was recommended to me by my bookshop seller, she raved about it so I thought I'd give it a go, It took so long to get into it, I even put it down and read another book in between. The plot was fine, but I hate books when half of it is about - I really like this man/woman but their too rich for me. The whole book was like a hot and cold shower. One minute your getting the smouldering look, the next it's ice cold. PLEASSSSSE.It got so boring I was skipping the bits about the couple and just reading the plot, which has never happened before, normally I skip the plot cause the couple are so interesting."
2,I was pretty unhappy with this one,I really thought this book would be better. I was alittle disappointed by it.I have heel spurs with constant feet problems. I thought this one would help.Sorry
5,Great kit!,"Belt works great. This belt timing kit will be used on a 2003 Miata. Timing belt has to be changed out every 60,000 miles."
3,And now for something different..,"MacKinnon's most noteworthy contribution to jurisprudential thought has been to point out the patriarchal assumptions of the U.S. Constitution, in light of modern feminist theory. In Towards a Feminist Theory..., MacKinnon writes an almost Foucaultian analysis of current constitutional jurisprudence -- the post-modern assessment of individual thought censorship as perpetrated by the male-dominated forum of political discourse is prevalent in many of her works but particularly, in this one.She is a compelling and dramatic writer and while her arguments run the gamut -- from the distastefully provocative to rigorously logical to total raving rants, it is impossible to dismiss her entirely. I recommend that those interested in her writings read the law review articles she has written on similar issues. It should be taken with the grain of salt, however, that her biases against men in general are profound and even disturbing."
2,"a poetic, important, and terrible book","MacKinnon writes with smoothe, poetic prose, that disguises her petulant and arrogantly low estimation of the average women. The logical flaws only start there. The book is deeply myopic in its interpretation of history, just as Marx's work (MacKinnon's ideal) was. I recommend it only because of the woefully influential effect it is having on the U.S. judicial system - know thine enemy!"
1,She's completely whacked,To call this an academic exercise is absurd. It's just political polemic. In a more intellectually honest age she would have no academic position from which to preach. She's a patron saint of intolerance.
3,perfect for fun,+vesmall sizesharp picture qualitylonger bettry life-vei didnt like the color quality of the capturesnight pictures are blur if you choose night mode if not comes very darkmy friend has fuji s3100 and i think is a better choice over this camera:(
2,It was good...while it lasted,"My parents bought this brand for Christmas for both my brother's family and mine. Last summer, we both complained (to each other!) that it used a ton of batteries, but it was more of an inconvenience than anything else. Since November '06, my camera now only takes clear pictures in bright situations, such as outside. Forget taking anything indoors at this point - it is nothing but a complete blur that not even a picture program can fix. I have missed so many pictures because of it! I will never buy a Fuji again."
3,Good Digital Camera but faulty shutter button,I've spent $200.00 on what I thought was a quality digital camera from a reputable company (FujiFilm). After only a few years of moderate use my shutter button popped out and the plastic tab that holds it in place was also broken. It's design has been very cheap and will not withstand longterm use. Please listen to my warning and avoid wasting your money. I am unable to get a replacement shutter button for a digital camera that is still functional if this button was replaced. I miss using my digital camera and can see how digital camera manufacturers continue to sell newer models of their cameras. They have been designed to fail eventually.
5,Great Bargain,This was an awesome bargain. Got this as a Christmas present for my 12 year old son. He is having a ball with it- pictures and videos.thanks
2,Buzzing sound.. tempermental,"I've had my fuji finepix for about 3 years. After the second year I dropped it from well not that far, ever since it makes a buzzing sound and chooses to work when it wants too. Half the time the lcd screen is dark indoors and sometimes the zoom does not work. I always blamed dropping it for it's issues, but apparently everyone else has had the same problem. I will be replacing it this year with a panasonic."
2,"great pix, if the damn thing worked..","i recieved this camera as a xmas present some years back. it was a bit pricey for the quality @ $250 bucks. and although the pics usually come out pretty nice, the battery issue is infuriating! the camera will turn on for a mili-second and as you press the shutter, it turns off. i have bought all different types of batteries, and none will work with it. it will SOMETIMES take ONE or maybe up to FIVE pictures, before turning itself off. it will also turn off sometimes if you use the zoom. so, basically it actually WORKS about 15% of the time, and i've missed so many pictures over the years!"
1,Not so good,"I have had this camera for a year now and am more unimpressed every time I use it. It is hard to take pictures that are not blurred. Even though it is a 4.1 MP camera, most online photo developing websites flag the pictures for low quality, meaning that anything over 4x6's are discouraged. It is an easy camera to use and takes the picture in the viewfinder with a minimum of delay, but it is a low quality and probably blurred image. There are better cameras out there for the price!"
5,Easy Point & Shoot,This is a great little camera - easy point & shoot..the software is very user friendly and makes downloading pics/video a snap. If you have never had a digital camera it is a good place to start. My only suggestion is to get a larger memory card it only comes with a 16mb.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I also have a Fuji S5000 which is great, but this camera did not live up to the quality and ease of picture taking as I had expected. It is hard to see the LCD (very dim) and many of the pictures turn out blurry. You have to be very careful when holding the unit. The price and size was right, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not worth it,"I got this camera in the summer of 2006. It worked fine until about January 07. I took it out to take a picture and received the ""zoom error"" message. I took it to my local camera shop along with my warranty and they sent it off to be fixed. I finally received my camera back from the Fuji company 2 months later- the lens appeared to be fixed. However this past weekend while attending a Baltimore Orioles game, I took the camera out to take a picture and once again received the ""zoom error"" message for no apparent reason. I will not be sending the camera off to be fixed again. I refuse to wait 2 months to get back a camera that is ""kind of"" fixed. I will never buy a Fujifilm camera again."
4,Not Bad,"I got this camera when I was sixteen(three years ago) and I would have continued using it, but I dropped it in the sand and the zoom is now broken. I never had any serious problems with it.Pros:-Easy to use settings-Easy to use zoom-Good picture qualityCons:-Lcd would sometimes be delayed-flash is very bright on auto mode and washes people out-if you zoom in to far, it looks really grainy-I had the same problem with the shutter not opening and getting a blury image"
2,More Zoom Errors,"I bought this camera last June. Zoom error appreared in Feb. I mailed it in for warranty and it came back with scratches on the side and a note saying ""not repairable"". I was careful with this camera and it was never dropped - I inspected it prior to shipping to make sure I hadn't somehow dented it etc. Now it looks like someone took a tool and jabbed it. It definately won't hold up to normal wear."
3,Not bad - not great,"I got this camera as a present a year about a year ago. The image quality isn't bad, but it's a bit fuzzy at high resolution. I was pretty happy with it until I also got the ""zoom error"". This happened about 6 months in. I would turn on the camera, and the lens wouldn't come out, or the shutter door wouldn't open, or some other issue with the lens would occur. I was able to get it to work on and off by trying to turn the camera on and off repeatedly, but after a couple months of that, I got tired of messing around. I emailed FUJI tech support for an RMA (they have a 1 year warranty, folks), and with 1 day left on my warranty I mailed the camera to them for repair. Within 7 days they had my camera headed back to me repaired and working great.It's unfortunate that this line has these zoom errors. If you got a camera and the zoom error was already repaired, then there's nothing to worry about. I just wish that I hadn't needed to send this in for an RMA in the first place."
4,"Good, dependable camera","I need a camera that has excellent macro functions. So I'm going to get another brand. But I've enjoyed this camera. It's easy to use. It doesn't take much space. And it is very easy to upload the photos and work with the camera.If you want a very good camera at a reasonable price, this is a good one. Good for print or the Web."
1,"Before warranty, not working, Past warranty - $60!!! to repair,","This camera is a lemon!!!! The shutter stopped working before the warranty ran out. It belongs to my daughter and she didn't tell us; she just stopped using it. Power on and either you get a noise, or a partly open shutter w/o focus, or if you are lucky once every 10 tries, you might be able to take a picture. Stepdaughter also got the same camera with the same defect; she sent it back after warranty - a $60 dollar repair bill. The camera is currently selling new for $60. Read other reviews w/ the same problem. Manufacturers should not charge such a hefty fee to repair when their merchandise is defective. Will probably just get a new camera and definitely not a Fuji!!!"
2,OK for outside photos,"The performance of the camera for daytime outdoor pictures is very good, but I returned it...The reasons:The flash is pretty weak and the lack of an assisting beam lamp leads to out-of-focus pictures when indoors. Do yourself a favor, spend some extra money and buy something like Canon Powershot A520. I am happy I did."
1,Good camera until it croaked!,"I bought the Fuji A345 about one year ago. It took good pictures, especially outdoors. Used it on a river tour in Russia during the summer and was especially pleased with the convienence of being able to slip it in my pocket. (I had an Olympus C3000 camera with me also which took better pictures in poor lighting situations.) After about a year the lens extension started sticking and the focusing was having problems. Also at this time, the battery life, which was marginal to begin with, took a dive. Finally the lens would not extend at all. And all of this just after the warranty ran out. No more Fujis for me. I am replacing it with a Canon."
3,ok for the money,"This camera is not too bad. Actually it's pretty good, i guess. it's my first digital. It's fairly user friendly. I do have one MAJOR complaint, though. It EATS UP your batteries. Maybe it's b/c I'm learning the camera and therefore, using it a lot. If you are on vacation, you might go thru a pack of batteries per day. I'm seriously considering sending it back because of that reason. Also I was disappointed that there was no panoramic feature. But that's my fault for not checking. A case would have been nice, too. Other than that, I guess it's okay. I'm still not positive that i would recommend it to my cousin who wants one. I would say that this is a decent digital camera-not great, but not awful."
2,Dont take it to the beach,"I was very excited to get this camera. It was easy to use, small, light weight, took great pics. Made the mistake & took it to the beach. That's when it stopped working. I sent it to be fixed ($65 later). Anyway, got it back & took it to the beach again. Needless to say, it stopped working again. All my friends have Cannon cameras & dont have any problems when they go to the beach with their cameras. So now I'm going to buy a Cannon camera. Fujifilm, disappointing........very disappointing."
2,disappointed,"I bought this camera to replace my broken A330. I loved the A-330, and wrongfully assumed that the 345 would be at least as good as its predessor. I was wrong! Half of my pictures are blurred, the colors are not true, the battery indicator is a joke, macro is useless, and it is slow. I wish I could still find the outdated 330. I am now searching for a new camera after only 2 months using the 345."
1,Completely turned off,"My husband and I bought this camera for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It worked great when we first used it in December. The camera has not been used much since. We are due to have a baby in the next couple weeks and thought it would be nice to have a few pictures for the album so we got the camera out. This is when our problem began. It is only 5 months later and we changed the batteries in the camera. Now when we go to take a picture, anytime you want to zoom in or even snap the picture, then lens closes and the camera turns itself off.When you are on a budget, a camera like this seems expensive so you would think that the quality of the product would be reliable. However, I feel that you would be better off buying a more expensive camera with a better name knowing you will be satisfied long term."
2,not much for the money,I thought that buying a fuji camera would give great quality pictures. The pictures are just okay. They seem to be dark and not as clear as I would like them to be. I found myself being very disappointed with the camera.
4,Less well-known works worth hearing.,"I had previously heard the 'Festive' symphony on a Marco Polo disc, a dependable source for rare works as always. This performance is much better played despite the age of the recording. The Dvorak 'Cunning Peasant' has not been recorded very widely either, and is played well enough despite significant tape hiss. There is another Supraphon release with the same orchestra/conductor with three other less common Smetana works. Between them they provide a useful look at a composer best know for ""Ma Vlast' and 'The Bartered Bride"". Recommended."
4,"Also published as ""The Primrose Try""","Another very good Luke Short story, an undercover U.S. Marshall is sent to Junction City and Primrose to help get evidence on 2 men and their henchmen who have been skamming the government in regard to cattle sold for reservation indians, and later turn to murder to remove a dangerous witness, this book was published as The Primrose Try in 1967 and 1984 by Bantam, wonder how Jove books got this story under another name stating that this was the first time in print, oh well"
1,Ordered for halloween,Much to our dismay we found out too late that this is probably the worst quality chocolate -- possibly stored somewhere improperly?Very chalky -- I love chocolate and had to spit this out.
2,Not your typical chocolate,"I really did not like the taste of these chocolates. My nieces and husband did, but I thought there was an unusual taste."
1,Boring,There is no melody or rhythm here. It sounds like an introductory lesson in how to play steel drum.
4,On the sly,"This is a great album, but you'd never know it from your first listen. What strikes you at first as being bland and disposable, after repeated listenings shows its subtle melodiousness. The sardonic lyrics become more incisive, the smart architecture of the arrangements seems brighter, until after you've listened to it a half-dozen times, it becomes a favorite album."
5,breathtaking!,"To set the parameters here, I know nothing of academics regarding music. So this review is for those who look to read layman/casual remarks. My first criteria for most 'music'al anything is: does it create an emotion. Without question, hands down, irrevocably, this version most certainly did! And not just for a track or two: in its entirety, this version is stunning. I did not know that I could simultaneouly feel both awe and bone melting....but the countertenor/tenor of 'o death..' impacted me that way. Where previously I have cringed at the female soprano...the treble drew me like a lodestone. While 1959/Sargent is 'grand', this version is 'pure'. I deeply bow to those who came together to create this breathtaking version."
5,1751 Messiah,"This is a wonderful recording of the _Messiah_ for those who like things historically accurate. It is the first time I've heard it done by an all-male choir, but being the appreciator of history that I am, it was amazing to finally hear it done as legend says Handel would have had a choir do it. There are also a few surprises, things that according to the label are that way because of the historical accuracy, arias given to singers in different vocal ranges than we in the 21st century are used to, that make for a nice texture to the work (my favorite example of this being ""Rejoice Greatly, Oh Daughter of Zion,"" which is usually done by the Soprano sololist, is given to the Tenor on this disc and is absolutely beautiful on here.)"
5,Wonderful music!!!,"We've all heard Messiah, or parts of it many times. Routine classical FM, holiday concerts and recitals, recordings in our own collections. If classical music can be said to have ""old standards"", this composition definitely qualifies. That said, this is the most emotionally evocative, beautifully performed and recorded version I have ever heard! If anyone were to ask me what version they should get for their personal collection, this is the one I will recommend from now on. This is the first version that has evoked an emotional reaction in me, nearly bringing me to tears several times. The voicing, pacing, expressiveness is absolutely wonderful. If you love Messiah, you will love this recording!"
3,"Nice gift basket (on sale), but beware.","I bought this as a ""me treat,"" with the additional benefit of it being on sale.The products are nice, and a useful size (no travel sized stuff here.) The basket's cute, and this is an excellent introduction to the Masada line.The one thing that's bothersome, though, is how the products are put in the basket. They're all hot-glued in there with what must be liquid cement. You can peel it off the body products, but God help you with the nail brush and other wooden implement. Absolutely impossible to get the glue lumps off.Might not seem to be that big of a deal, but because of where the glue lumps were located, they render the nail brush useless! What a waste! I gave up and tossed it out.This would be a nice gift set for the price (I paid $18) if you're looking for a quicky Christmas type gift. But only give it to someone you don't see often. They'll be too apt to tell you they needed a blow torch to get the stuff OUT of the basket!"
2,Menopause Help,This product was NOT a help for me at all ... In fact it heightened my hot flashes and night sweats ... on the search for something else. Sadly disappointed ... had hopes I would finally stop having difficulties with hot flashes etc.
3,Good product,Product was as advertised and works great. The only complaint is that it took longer than anticipated to arrive - 2 weeks.
3,Andy H,"Buying the tanks is a waste of money. This is because most gas dealers will not accept the tanks for filling and refilling and want customers to purchase or rent their store's tanks. Other than this issue, the product is of high quality."
4,One of the better Chromium Caps Available,"This is one of the better Chromium caps available and one of the best prices per dose. I buy 4 bottles at a time to get the free, fast shipping."
5,great!,Got here fast and watched all the episodes before the new seasoned started! Best series next to West Wing!
5,Awesome!!!!,I gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She was home for semester break. We are totally addicted. While on vacation we watched at least two episodes a day!! FANTASTIC!!!!
4,My favorite Medical Drama,"""My favorite Medical Drama"". Another good season, I recommend buying the whole series, good character development, even have some I don't like (because they want you not to like them)"
5,GREAT. On time!,Product was brand new as they had stated and I received well before the date they told me I was supposed to get it. Awesome!
4,"Missing episodes (13, 14, and 27)","I just started watching the show and loved it. However, when I watched the second season and noticed there were three episodes missing in the DVD set. They are episodes 13, 14, and 27. I googled the problem and it came up a lot of similar situation. Some said all the DVD sets are like that and they don't know why. Has anyone experienced this?"
5,Exciting!,"I ordered the season episodes because I saw it on TV and I was FAR behind but it was so GOOD, I had to know what happened to lead them up to the point in which I started watching. I am now have a new found LOVE for this show and will continue watching."
3,NO SOUND IN BEGINNING OF EPISODES,"This season is better than the first, however in the beginning of the episodes there is no sound until after the review from previous episodes."
5,Grey's Anatomy Season 2,"Awesome awesome awesome! I love Grey's Anatomy so much! So captivating! These DVDs arrived in no time, and were practically in mint condition. (Yay!)"
4,A good balance between medical reality and romance,"Lead Character Meredith Grey's life sometimes makes you just want to turn away and shake your head. There are some seriously disappointing moments here--and as her best friend Christina says, ""Meredith is all dark and twisty."" The ensemble cast is fabulous and some of the episodes are so heart wrenching ""Into You LIke A Train"" where an couple of strangers are stuck togetether after a train wreck and only one can survive, are beyond tear jerkers. I think Grey's will go down as one of the best medical dramas on TV since M*A*S*H and ER. Many of the episodes are worth watching over and over."
3,Sickness...is everywhere...,"Gosh, it seems that every person who works in this hospital is so SICK literary... Main characters, their mothers, sisters, brothers, fathers, boyfriends, colleagues, it can go on and on... Now even dog has a cancer! It's epidermic! I hope they will change something in Season 3."
5,greys anatomy,"The greys anatomy season two was shipped to me before the estemated arival time, which I loved. the season two was amazing, I still watch it even though I have seen it about 10 times."
5,Grey's Anatomy - Season 2,"The writing is so good in this series that by the 2nd season we were totally involved in the lives of all of the characters. There are plot twists and medical emergencies that kept us guessing - and not all of the endings are predictable. With so many characters the series does not become boring - minor characters evolve and grow until suddenly you realize you care about them as well as the original main characters. While we know that there is more drama than at a real hospital, the series does give an added depth of appreciation for the pressures that doctors endure during internship. Excellent writing and acting plus an education! It's a ten in our book!"
1,Not so good,This took forever to arrive at my house and when it did none of the disks worked. Would not purchase again.
5,Grey's Anatomy series 2,This series is even better than the first one. The characters develop more and the story lines are excellent.If you liked the first series you are in for a real treat with this one
5,I love Greys anatomy,"Video was new wrapped in plastic still , this is my third box set for season 2 my daughter just loves it and wears out the disc, I would recommend this to anyone"
5,Grey's Season 2 is Awesome!,"The second season on DVD was great. It comes with 6 DVDs and a ton of bonus materials. There is also a little catalogue that comes with it with pictures of the cast. I would recommend this DVD set to anyone. In fact, buy the first season too!"
5,Grey's is amazing.,I'm one of the few guys that is really into Grey's Anatomy. I think it's a great show. Season 2 is certainly worth purchasing. I bought this right before Season 3 was aired so I could re-cap everything. The bonus features are kind of lacking on these DVDs in my opinion though.
5,One of the best season of Grey's,"One the most dramatic, conflicting, and romantic season of Grey's anatomy...You can really feel various emotions, especially the last 3 episodes.This also includes one of the sweetest scene between Derek and Meredith.The episode regarding the bomb is really tense.Overall, it's really a very nice season."
1,Purchase of Grey's Anatomy Season 2,"I have seen this season of Grey's many times and absolutely LOVE this season, so decided to purchase this!!! I would HIGHLY recommend watching/purchasing this season...it's GREAT! So...the reason for ONE star is not for the actual television season. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN FROM THIS PARTICULAR SELLER!!! The product I received was not only missing episodes (so, I had to watch the missing ones on Netflix)! BUT...some of the DVD's were damaged and would skip and distort! What a WASTE of money! :-( Sad to pay money for a BAD product."
5,Love this show!,"i have watched this show from the start. i find it different from most hospital shows. you are somehow drawn to the main characters and you share empathy with them. its just plain entertaining.i think they chose the ""right"" actors to play each character. there is not always a happy ending, so i do find it more realistic than most. its one of those shows that ""hooks"" you!"
5,The way television drama is suppose to be!,"An amazing season to an amazing show! The story lines are real, and you begin to realize what all the hype is about. Highly recommended!"
5,McAwesome,"I work in a hospital ER and although it's not nearly as glamorous as Grey's Anatomy, I still love watching it. I absolutely love this show! The characters are full of character and feeling and sense and everything that is in the best shows!!! The story lines are totally believable and there are sad parts, funny parts, intense moments, and refreshing insights...just everything I love in a great show. There are enough surprises to keep you guessing, but enough stability to keep me coming back to watch the next episode. This is truly an absolutely wonderful show!"
1,Lip Sync,Lip sync-ing was out throughout the whole of the DVD. I watched it but it was very distracting from what should have been an enjoyable experience
4,Brilliant wrting and acting,"You won't be disappointed by this 27 seven episode sequel. That many won't even get you bored. Congrats on the excellent story telling, production and writing! Good value no question."
5,Loved it,"I just love Grey's Anatomy... recommend it to anyone, especially if you can watch all at once without commercials."
5,AMAZING,I received my item as it was told me. The box was in excellent condition as were the actual cd's themselves.
5,Awesome addiction!,I loved season two of Grey's Anatomy. What a great show! My husband and I are rediculously addicted to it!
5,Grey's Anatomy is awesome,"I bought both the 1st and Second season of Grey's Anatomy because I watched the reruns during the summer and every episode was great, do I bought the dvd to catch myself up on all the episodes. They are all so much fun and awesome."
5,Just love Grey's anatomy,This is the only TV series I watch and to have the complete Series 2 on DVD is fabulous as I often forgot to turn the TV on to watch it. I can't wait for Series 3.
1,Grey's anatomey Vol 2,"Cant review product, haven't received it yet. 1st time i ordered it was 20 oct due to arrive 1 dec, then sent again on 8 dec due to arrive 8 jan. suprise suprise no grey's for me"
3,"Grey's Anatomy vs House, M.D.","Grey's Anatomy will appeal to the evening soap opera crowd, who also liked Friends (and was/is swayed easily to chuckle along with the laugh track, instead of the actual dialogue and whose view of real world is somewhat fantasy based).House, M.D. is bar none the best drama (medical or otherwise) to come along in a virtual drought of worthwhile viewing."
2,Not working,"I'm very sad, this movie is not playing correctly!! :( The voice and picture don't match up and are playing not in sync ONE bit!! :P"
4,"Compelling, soapy dramedy","I normally go for sci-fi or action. I never watch soap operas. But Grey's Anatomy is a show my wife and I both love. The number and frequency of relationships is unrealistic, as is the fact that every patient seems to open up their deepest feelings to interns they just met. But it's funny and dramatic and chock-full of heart-wrenching, tear-jerking moments as our young heroes save (or fail to save) the patient-du-jour. I highly recommend you give this show a shot. If you're a native Seattle-ite you'll also enjoy the gratuitous exterior shots of Seattle landmarks.The DVDs are definitely the way to go. No waiting for next week's episode, plus, several of the episodes have extended versions on the DVD."
5,Grey's was awesome,"Season 2 of Grey's Anatomy was fantastic. With about 27 fantastic episodes, I could not stop watching them until I'd finished the whole season. Will probably watch them again soon."
4,Season 2 DVD,"Great to relive Season 2, here in Australia as the holiday season is an absolute drought on tele! Loved the extras, especially about Chandra, Dr Bailey and the set tour."
5,The Name says it All.,A real mind opening book for those whom are willing to let their minds be opened. The author objectively shows how even the most logical of minds is able to admit logically that it is G_D whom created our world and all that is within it. He uses straight forward logic and documented sources. He quotes well known and respected personalities with a complete bibliography. Plus the book is very well written and very enjoyable to read. A must for everyone to better understand the world we are in.
2,Makes for Stimulating Fact-checking,"This book is so rife with factoids, that the exercise of fact-checking is an intellectually stimulating one. Please note, ""factoids"" are false--and I've used this word with that intention. With this book, Kelemen displays no esteem for the intelligence of men. This book may serve as an acid-test to identify those who are anti-rational or intellectually challenged."
2,Disappointing costly book,"The famous publishers of Graphis magazine have collected here a series of books that are of good design, but anyone who visits a trendy book store will see all those covered in, and a lot more interesting ones. The cost of the book and the fame of the publisher made me expect a great selection. Inside you'll only find -- almost -- american designs."
4,Nice tool,"This tool is very handy for the hand-loader and could be improved if the main shaft were metal. The plastic is ok and I can see how other posted reviews mention it as a weak spot. As long as one does not get overly rough with it, it should last."
1,wish i could give it less than one star...,"This was definitely a waste of my money. While the title states ""Splits & Flexibility"", if I had known it was simply watching somebody who already can do the splits (i.e. shows no progression of how he got there) over and over again, I never would have bought it. This is nothing more than a video of a guy who set up a camera in his studio and taped himself doing a two-hour stretch routine. There is no explanation as to why, as his advertising claims, his ""Secret Flexibility"" knowledge is superior to others. I see no ""secret"" to reaching the splits... he simply shows a few stretches that anyone can do (and anyone who has had fourth grade gym class already knows how to do) and then he goes into doing stretches that nobody could do unless they were already flexible enough to do the splits. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT. I'm sorry I did, and am only writing this because some other Amazon users have helped me save money in the past. Buyer beware!"
2,Disappointing,"The backcover text describes this book as a ""...hilarious anthology..."". However this is not a humorous book, let alone a hilarious one. The stories, written in the literary equivalent of a monotone, are simply dreary tales of other people's misfortunes, which after a few chapters become tedious. One particularly unmemorable story was entirely devoted to the author's encounters with human excrement in Nepal. The book's anthology format - a different ""great writer"" for each chapter - works against it. There is no consistent style, unless one considers bland writing a style. It _is_ possible to take travel misadventures and put a humorous spin on them (Carl Franz, ""The People's Guide to Mexico"", which is a great guide to boot) or even turn them into high comedy (Dave Barry ""Dave Barry Does Japan""), but the authors of this book fell far short of the mark."
3,A great gift for anyone who travels or wishes they could,"I keep giving this as gifts--partly because the short tales are managable for any reader, even those who read on a treadmill. Light-hearted, incredible but true, in good taste for the most part."
2,"Good, But Not Great","Some interesting stories here, and even some funny ones.However, you're going to see highly-educated writers employing vulgar language from time to time. If you think it's trendy and counter-cultural to use the F-word in literature, then this book is for you.Also, some writers are writing more to complain then they are to describe an actual horrible travel experience. Helen Gurley Brown whines about how shaving cream got on her husband's clothes in his suitcase and how she had to wait in line in India to upgrade the tickets on their flight. Ridiculous for someone who was all about creating an image of women years ago that was the opposite of her behavior in the India piece.Another author complains of initially being denied admission to the Rainbow Room because she was under-dressed. She was allowed in, though. Things like this make it hard for the common reader to identify and relate to parts of this book - everyone travels, but not as pretentiously as others."
4,Music Bridge,"Shipped on time, etc. Difficult to install, but once I figured it out it works really well. I had to re-install once because I killed a process that was not associated with an author (I would expect LinkSys to show as the author, but no), but that has been the only hiccup."
2,Mostly Useless,"Same as Airport Express: if you use your computer speakers for music on one floor and this device is plugged into the enterntainment system on another floor, or another room, you have to choose where not to hear your music. Trouble is, I want it all over, simultaneously. Tried the Roku, which doesn't disable the desktop speakers--but it's not simultaneous. Will return this device and wait for something affordable and flexible, I guess. Sonos is just too expensive... But the sound was fine for the few hours I used it--in the one room I didn't want to hear it in. And the setup was impossible, and the Linksys techs were awful. I finally figured it out myself after 3 hours."
3,disappointing,"surprisingly difficult to set up, and very finnicky one i got it working. I was getting frequent drop outs of the music because the linksys access point and bridge were in the same room, so i switched to using a wired setup and still had problems. it's great when it works, but not worth the trouble."
1,Wont work for me,"I have not been able to get this to work again. It was great for the first week, then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again. I am not sure I like that."
1,Don't buy this!,"Linksys really should stop selling this. I've tried dozens of times to install it, using two different wireless routers, all without success. If you look, you'll find some incredibly complex directions on the web, which require you to do everything but stand on your head and spin around three times while praying to the Cisco gods. Don't expect Linksys to help, either. If you really, really want this, let me know and I'll sell you mine -- cheap."
4,"Works great, just what I wanted.","I love this product. Set up wasn't difficult at all. I downloaded the firmware update before I did anything else and then just followed the directions. Intalled first time and works great. I bought two of these and gave one to a friend and he also had no problems with installing and loves they way it works. Streaming music from the computer to a home stereo is what I have been wanting for a long time, but didn't want to pay $300 for some of the other devices. The only problem that I have is that what they are charging here at Amazon is quite high, I got mine for $25, search pricegrabber.com before buying here."
1,Buyer Beware,"This product does not work with Vista SP1 installed. This is well dcumented and it does not appear Linksys is working on a fix.This product, with the latest firmware upgrade, does work with XP. However the output is very low may not be compatible with the auxillary input of a typical stereo amplifier.Also be aware the upgrade is downloaded in a zip file that does not expand correctly without errors.This is my first purchase of a Lynksys product. It was shipped with a two year old installation disk with a two year old firmware. Vista has been out for sometime and most computers sold do not have XP installed anymore. Perhaps this is a product that should be discontinued or sold with a warning so that cutomers don't waste there money or time. I'm not sure I would purchase another Lynksys product after this experience."
1,Wireless Music Bridge WMB54G,"I have many hours into getting this music bridge to run, and would have bought something else to replace it. Do yourself a favor...find something that works with Vista and skip this thing."
3,"Great Sound, Terrible Vista Support","Let me first say that this unit is great when it's up and running. My router and this device are two rooms apart and it connects skip-free.However, Vista support is terrible. I had to spend 3 chat sessions with Linksys to get it running. Make sure you download the latest software from Linksys and make the setup file (as well as the program it installs) run in Windows XP compatibility mode. If you don't know what I'm talking about and you intend to use this with Vista, do not buy this!"
1,Linksys wireless music bridge is junk!,Dont even bother purchasing this. Documentation of the device setup and yahoo music engine is worse than none-existant. Lynksys tech support has always been excellent for all other products except this one. After nearly a month still can't get it to work even marginaly.Linksys WMB54G Wireless-G Music Bridge
2,Great wireless bridge - not Vista compatible,I bought it only as a wireless bridge on my Samsung Blu-Ray player and it works ok for that purpose. I tried to use it as it's intended use - music bridge - but it doesn't work with either of my Vista computers. It is too bad that Linksys support is so poor for this product because it is cheaper than other bridges and it could be both a music bridge and wireless bridge since it has ethernet and audio inputs.
2,music bridge not bridging my music,"i ordered the music bridge and was excited about the idea of wirelessly sending music to my receiver and sound system. However, I didn't learn until spending an extensive amount of time on a few forums that it isn't compatable with vista. Great! I did get it to work with an old laptop of mine but the sound quality was poor and the music would cut out every few seconds. I won't use it again. I would try a different product."
1,Linksys WMB54G,This product is the hardest thing to install I have ever purchased. After about 10 hours of work and numerous calls to tech support I was able to get it working by following the instructions on the web site from another user.
1,No way,This product should be revised for linksys people.The wizard on CD doesn't work at all.... I tried thousands times to install the bridge. According to the wizard the installation was always successful however the bridge never worked ....following manual instructions founded in the linksys forum posted for another user didn't work either...my comp is latest DELL generation. Technical support after 500 hundred calls concluded that the issue was related with windows vista.....At the end the device didn't work and what is clear is that they are offering a product with difficulty to be installed and no technical support.
1,Worst Wireless Device I have Ever Worked with,"The Linksys WMB54G is the worst wireless device I have ever encountered, and I have set up many, many routers, Rokus, and other hardware. It just plain does not work -- the installation software is buggy and won't even uninstall properly when you finally give up on trying to get it to work. All the negative things said in all the other reviews are absolutely true. I suspect the few good reviews were written by Linksys employees, because this product is a total lemon."
1,Compound Aggravation,"WorkED fantastically with XP for 1 day. After that...worked intermittently with XP after may software repairs and re-installs. Absolutely, positively, not Vista compliant in any mode or manner."
1,Problems and beware that you can't return this product!!!,"The bridge does not work with our internet connection-- if one is connected, the other is not. Compatability issue. Granted our computer is 4+ years old (Windows XP) however it meets the min. requirements....We have not received a reply from this vendor. Moonlight merchant has no phone number or address that I can find on the Internet. Very worrisome. Amazon.com also has no information on the vendor. They offer an email service, but the Vendor has not responded....."
1,The Worst Product ever from Linksys,I bought this product and I think Linksys should stop selling this product. It works Randomly. Is not reliable at all.Jose Q
1,waste of money,"This was the biggest waste of time & money. I am a network engineer. I have 15 years of experience with wired and wireless networks. I could not get the bridge to see the SSID of my AP. I tried for over 6 hours, thinking that I had done something wrong. I even used my Linux wireless tools to diagnose the traffic to no avail. This device just plain sucks.I wish I could rate this a zero, but the only choice is a ""1""."
1,"Abandon Hope, all ye who enter here","I have spent far too much time and far too many dollars trying to create wireless capability for playing music files stored on my PC through my home stereo. I have tried a couple of routers, finally downgrading to WRTG54 router so I could get the best compatibility with my WMB54. Even after 12 hours with Linksys live chat, emails and phone calls; adding an $80 repeater (at their suggestion)I cannot get music without a great deal of stuttering, skips etc. I can't seem to replace the antenna on the music bridhe which was the last improvement i could think of making. Linksys has shown no interest in solving my problem. Refuses to take back a product that I purchased at their recommendation that did nothing to improve fidelity. I'm so fed up w/ Linksys support that I can't imagine trying any further fixes with their equipment."
1,HORRIBLE - DON'T BUY - ZERO STARS,"It just doesn't work. I paid $100 for it, it literally works 20% of the time. I have been on with Linksys support for a total of about 10 hours over the last 3 months (with an additional 10 hours of my time alone). They have told me TWICE that it must be defective and to exchange it. Which I did. Still the same problems (multiple ones)... after THREE units. They don't return phone calls, don't respond to emails, pass you off to another agent after spending an hour with one, without getting the new agent up to speed. It is just a piece of junk and the support line is total useless bull. Save your money and get an iPod and docking station. Don't even spend a buck on this."
3,"Works fine on WinXP, needs manual work on Win7","I bought the music bridge several years ago and it worked relatively fine on my Windows XP system for years. The instructions worked pretty easily to set it up and I used it all of theh time to stream music to my stereo. I did upgrade the firmward and PC utility once or twice, and that was OK.But, when I recently got a new Win7 laptop ... oh boy ... what a mess. The native driver is NOT Win7 compatible and it doesn't appear that Cisco cares. It's been a while since Win7 has been available, but Cisco still hasn't released a Win7 compatible driver. Sigh.So, a lot of internet searching uncovered this page, which outlines the steps to make it work: [....]. It's a bit of a pain, and fairly manual to setup, but it does work. Thanks to the author of that page, I now have it working under Win7.Overall, I love the function which this utility provides and I use it a lot, but I think Cisco could do a lot better with the drivers and software."
2,No drivers for Windows 7,"I used the bridge for 2 years on my laptop running XP and it was great. Most of the installation issues folks have is with the security settings on their wireless router. I had to replace that laptop and Windows 7 is all I could get. Unfortunately the software does not work with Windows 7. Windows 7 has been out long enough for Linksys to have the software updated but it appears they do not. Bottom line is if you have Windows 7, don't buy this. Mine is useful only for the blinking blue lights. Nice decoration."
1,Difficult to Set UP,"Got this product from a frequent flyer rewards program..After 6 hours talking to support people I could barely understand, I was told that the system was not compatible with Vista 64 bit.. Tried the setup on my XP, but still didn't work. If you are not a computer wireless expert, and I mean expert!, do not waste your money. Customer support from Cisco was the worst I have ever experienced."
1,Does not work with Vista,"The documentation says to download the Vista driver from Linksys. Their website says the driver is ""coming soon"". I contacted Tech Support and they admitted there was no driver available. Do not buy this product!"
1,Do not buy it,"How can you sell a high-tech consumer product in October 2007 and don't have support for Windows Vista? No support from linksys, they are laughing that you did not check compatibilityI considered linksys as a serious company. Not any more"
1,Not good.,"I got this product a while ago. It would work, then it'd stop. Then I'd reinstall everything, it'd work again, but soon it would stop working all over again.It seems that I can get it to work whenever I want, provided I completely reinstall the software whenever I need to reboot my PC.So, it sits there unused. It's a piece of junk.Edit: Thrown away. I got an Xbox. It does what this thing is supposed to do flawlessly."
1,"product didnt work, terrible online chat support - dont buy","the product didnt work out of the box. after 5 hours of online chat support, it still didnt. the chat support was very frustrating - i kept losing the reps on the other end and being assgned reps who knew nothing of the product. apparently the reps sign off without telling you when they cannot fix your problem. this should have been an easy install because my other gear is also linksys. not so. i plan to return it tomorrow."
2,No Current Windows Vista compatibility,"I had the wireless bridge working fine with my Windows XP computer, it also worked great with my Yahoo Music account. After I bought a new one computer running on Vista I couldn't get it to work with the existing Music Bridge drivers.As per Linksys technical support there are no existing Vista drivers for this product and it will not work under that operating system.Good product if you have a windows XP machine though. It is a shame that Linksys hasn't provided the drivers for Windows Vista."
2,Get the Airport Express instead,"This product is next to impossible to set up if you don't have a linksys router (be sure to enter your wep in hex, but that's just the first problem, you probably also need to reset your computer's IP address so they are on the same subnet). Mainly, you can only have one of these working at a time, so the Apple Airport Express with Airtunes is far superior in this respect (and can play almost any sounds, not just itunes, with the Rogue Amoeba shareware product).So I'm selling my wm54g and getting Airports."
1,WMB54G USELESS-G MUSIC BRIDGE - NO VISTA DRIVER,"Linksys is NOT going to support this product and release a VISTA DRIVER. Their web-site says:*If your Linksys product does not appear on any of these three lists, there is no plan to support the product with Windows Vista.It ain't on the list.Great News after waiting more than a year for the ""Coming Soon"" Vista Driver!If you run Vista, don't waste your time or money! It doesn't work because Linksys has not released the Vista Driver (XP was difficult enough to install). I upgraded my PC's to VISTA and have waited and waited and waited.... The XP driver does not work. Hey, it's only been a year.Works great as a paperweight though and it does have pretty blue lights on the front!"
1,Doesn't Work,"Sounds like a great idea -- if only it delivered. I had a similar problem to a previous reviewer: the music would get interrupted every 15-20 seconds. Oddly enough, this only happened when the music file was stored on a drive other than my system drive (C:) As with most high-tech companies, tech support was useless -- they had no idea why this was happening.So I returned it, bought the Apple Airport express, and it's working just fine, regardless of where my music is stored (C drive, F drive, CD, whereever)."
2,no concurrent playback on a PC and the Bridge,"I bought this unit to play my music on my deck, while my PC is in the basement. Guess, I cannot hear what is played on the deck while I'm in the basement. I can see the title - but it is not the same...The utility which Linksys provides with the unit does not allow a concurrent playback on a PC and the Bridge. I cannot believe they intentionally made it this way! The software must be enahanced to allow a concurrent playback on a PC and the Bridge. Even more, the software should ask what audio source should be used ( e.g. WAVE, MINI, MIC tec.)."
2,There is a much better solution,"I've owned one of these guys for about 8 months now, and it has never worked consistently. Following some of the helpful online tutorials, I was able to get it working - for a while. Like many others say, you are potentially bound for hours of headaches with this thing.If you are interested in a wireless music solution for getting music off your PC to a home stereo system, let me do you a big favor and steer you toward one of the devices made by Roku, such as the M1000.Seriously, avoid this. Get an M1000 or better. I did, and it solved my entire problem and then some."
1,64 Bit Not Supported by Linksys and No Fix in Sight!,"Not exactly an expert in PC's, but no slouch. Bought this around Christmas time to play music over our surround system. Also purchased a new HP touchscreen.Problem? Yep - the Vista version on the PC is 64 bit and this bridge won't work with it. There are various work arounds on the forums, but nothing that Linksys supports.No due date for firmware upgrade either, so I will look for something else.Very disappointing!"
4,Let's get the party started!!,"Awesome product, but a total pain to set up! I love it for the digital output to my living room stereo system, everybody loves the internet radio stations jamming hard on my stereo. But I would recommend downloading the software updaters from the Linksys website for the firmware and utility software. And install them in that order. Don't even bother with the outdated installation CD, the website installation software is more current."
3,"Useful device, but requires 3rd party software for Vista","Bought it to stream audio into my living room from where my desktop was. I have Vista on my machine. Installing the drivers was a horrible experience. And I couldn't uninstall them either. Finally I ended up getting 3rd party drivers and it worked perfectly. Overall, not a bad product. Works as advertised, IF you manage to get the right drivers. For most people, that'll be a deal breaker.3 stars because of crappy drivers, and crappier support."
1,cmdaudio dill,"After searching the web and being on hold with Linksys for 50 minutes, I was told by technical support to trymy brand new WMB54G on a nother computer. Yikes. The setup hangs at a missing cmaudiow.dll file. This as of Oct 2008."
2,"WinXP difficult, Vista incompatible","Does not work with Vista.Works sometimes with Windows XP.Wireless performance is poor.Wired works OK.So, if you want a wired Windows XP audio extension, it works pretty well.Almost as well as an, ummm, wire.For wireless I recommend theApple Airport Expressover this.For wired, I recommend theXITEL HiFi-Link For PC and Mac(which is discontinued, but available some places as of Aug 24 2008)"
1,More Junk from Linksys,"Look at the review by C-Net and you start to realize that here is another Cisco/Linksys product that just DOES NOT WORK.I am not a computer expert and don't have the time to become one.When I spend the better part of $100.00 I expect the product to work.The Wireless-G Music Bridge doesn't work.It especially doesn't work with Windows Vista Ultimate.Don't buy this product and write to Cisco/Linksys to let them know how dissatisfied you are with their products that make you be a computer expert to make them work.What ever happened with the promise of ""Plug and Play."""
1,Don't waste your money,I have it installed on an HP laptop running Windows XP with Service Pack 3. Very unreliable software--have to reboot the bridge all the time. Setup is impossible without tech support because it doesn't work as advertised. Rarely works wirelessly so I have it cabled to my wireless router. Better to wait for someone to build a better one.
1,Doesn't work!,"Can't get it to work! Installed the software, went through the instructions, stood on my head, recited mystical incantations, sacrificed small animals and still no music. This was given as a gift to my wife. It made me look like an idiot when I had worked so hard to give a nice gift. I had to buy another, more expensive gift to make up for it. Linksys products will be thoroughly avoided in the future."
1,Should never have left R&D,"I bought this product as the first step in building a home media network. The specs and features made it sound like the perfect solution to my needs but that all changed when I opened the box. Not only did it take about a 1/2 hour to configure but it only worked for 10 minutes. After that, I tried every conceivable means to get my network to recognize this deceive and nothing worked. BTW, I'm using a Linksys WR54G router so there's nothing complex going on here.Bottom line: big promise, no delivery. Unless you enjoy messing with router settings don't waste your time here."
2,not a fun product,"Out of the box, the Setup CD did not detect my bridge;rendering it useless. Made sure I was on the same network as the bridge(ie 192.168.1.?)--router is on 192.168.1.210. Nothing. Logging into the web brower setup was pointless, when you try to save settings the web browser either rejects the devices redirect page or gives you some authentication error. I had it working wirelessly, wired to a wrt54g, and wired directly to the computer. Everytime it was working it was great. No dropped sound, very few instances of lag issues. Great product when it works, which is almost never. I have mac address filtering and no key set on my network and even when I turn the filter off and the firewalls; it doesn't want to be found on the network. Avoid this product and save yourself headaches and disappointment. Seriously -- Not a good linksys product. There are alternative to this device. I'm sure any of them would be better then this joke. No firmware available."
1,Don't bother,"I thought all the nay-sayers were wrong - I called Linksys, followed the setup CD, looked great, except for one thing - it didn't work. Musicmatch wouldn't work at all, even through the PC speakers. Rhapsody, when switched to the music bridge, continued to stream through the PC speakers but with no controls.Wasted an afternoon - sending back."
1,"If I could give it negative stars, I would...","This product is surprisingly terrible. I'm a big fan of Linksys (and even moreso of Cisco,) my wireless network at home is Linksys and that at my workplace is Cisco. I am a systems/network administrator and I found the setup for this device to be unworth the effort. I am currently awaiting a Return Merchandise Authorization from Linksys so that I can send this piece of rubbish back."
2,Hummm ...,"The product does what it says it does. However, I didn't know I would lose audio from my PC when I activated the Music Bridge. Another annoyance was the device would only work if the application (iTunes) was not already started. If the connection was activated after the application was up (iTunes) then you would not get audio from the Music Bridge. I bought it for a significant discount off the listed price, so all in all, it wasn't a bad purchase."
2,Unimpressive,The sound quality is poor and the set up process can be troublesome. I would not recommend you buy this product.
3,Great once you get it setup,"Many reviews state this does not work with Windows Vista, this is simply not true anymore. There are drivers on Linksys' website and a firmware update for the unit that make it work for Vista. While the software update does allow it to work, it is not as smooth an interface as with XP. There is a forum on Linksys site which discusses almost every problem people have encountered.The configuration is not easy, setup is a pain and can be frustrating. However, once successful(it does work eventually) the unit works seamlessly. I would say it helps to be network/tech saavy if you buy this product, not plug and play. However, if wireless networks do not scare you, this unit for the price is fantastic."
1,Linksys Music Bridge a waste of money,The Linksys Music bridge is a waste of money. Neither I nor Linksys support can get it to work on my PC. Others on the Liksys website have similar problems.
4,Wireless bridge,The product does exactly what it is advertised for. The installation was quite simple and I got it running in few minutes. Now I can hear all my itunes music in my surround system.
4,perfectly suited for streaming playlists,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to upgrade everything first instead of using the cd. I struggled a while with making it work on 3 different machines (xp and vista) but now it's running and it does what I expected.The bad thing about the product is that there is still a small delay even in movie mode (also on LAN!) which makes it impossible to replace your pc speakers for watching movies.Another thing is the adapter. I'm from Europe so I had to buy a new adapter for it.I would recommand this product to people who don't want to spend lot's of money to a mediacenter. It's perfectly suited for streaming your playlists."
1,Do not buy this!,"I had problems out of the box because the included driver was not compatible with Windows Vista. After finally tracking down a Vista compatible driver from their website I was able to get the connection working. The wireless is less than reliable. The connection continually drops and then you have to manually reconnect the connection from an icon in your task tray to get it working again - sometimes you have to unplug the WMB54G to get it to reconnect. (My wireless router was only about 10 feet away by the way). After Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Vista, the WMB54G was no longer compatible again - Linksys has yet to release a new driver to fix this. You can get around it by setting compatibility mode to Windows XP Service Pack 2 (on the WMB54G program in the start menu) - but the connection dropping problem seemed even worse after doing this. Avoid this product if you are a Vista user, or if you want to use it with a wireless connection (so basically, avoid this product)."
1,Not 4 Vista,"The ""utility"" program (that is required to use the device) does NOT work with Vista!Linksys has been promising the driver for over a year now but with no delivery. I called them again tonight (1/19/08) and still got the same answer ""the driver will be coming soon"". I think the Cisco takeover is just going to kill this product instead of making it Vista compatible. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,hours with tech support and then it cuts out after a couple hrs.,Spent better than 4 hours with Linksys. Nobody ever suggested downloading the newest software for the unit?!! When I did that we were up and running within 1/2 hour. I thought great. Set it up for a party were having that weekend. 2 hours into the party the unit cuts out. Haven't had the time to go back and mess with it. If it worked as advertised it would be great.
3,Skip the hassle and buy the Apple AirPort Express,"I had no difficulty setting it up and getting it to work. I thought the directions were pretty straightforward. I LOVE the concept. The sound quality is pretty darn good - no issues. If I do lose some fidelity, it is pretty minimal, and worth the convenience of using my laptop to program my stereo.However, I am experiencing the sound breaks that others have experienced and it is very annoying. I am still fiddling with options to correct this. I even connected all four laptops in the house wirelessly to recreate some contention, but could not predict the sound breaks. If I can't fix this, I'll toss the unit.I have just increased the size of the streaming buffer in iTunes, hopefully this may have a positive affect. Based on some other notes, I'll try to move it around a little as well.OK - just tossed the Linksys and exchanged it for the Apple product (works great with my Toshiba Laptop). Twenty minutes and it was configured and working with no skips."
1,Avoid it!,"This product basically doesn't work. Setting up the network is fairly straightforward as described in other reviews. However, the unit I received didn't produce any sound even after it was connected either through a cat5e cable or a 802.11g signal. It was able to pop the speakers when the power was disconnected so the problem is probably the software that produces a virtual sound card under Windows.Also, the Installshield scripts are outdated and do not clean up after themselves."
3,Music Bridge is difficult to use in my case,"In my system I needed two music bridges to reach two audio systems, and one of the bridges needed to work through a Range Extender. The instructions were ok for getting the simple one going. I had real difficulty getting the Range Extender to work with the music bridge, though. I finally found that you have to give the second Music Bridge a different name and then initialize the range extender after the Music Bridge is located and plugged in.In the end, I can't use both bridges at the same time from the same computer, so I use one from one computer and one from another.I am an electronics engineer, and it took me several days to figure it all out. I expect most people would have given up on such an installation.Jim"
3,great most of the time,the bridge works well 85% of the time. The remainder of the time it tends to be erratic. A song will suddenly cut out and then cut in and out. The same song works on the computer speakers. I have reinstalled the bridge software but the trouble persist.
4,Wireless routher.. COULD work!,"This is really a neat item.I cannot understand how the company Linksys has not perfected the software and installation for it, yet keep selling them lolI think they need a better help desk, there seem to be many things that can cause a problem including the anti virus, because you are sending the music through your wireless router, I guess mine is having a problem with that!My Amazon Purchase went well and the company I got it from had it to me in few days faster than expected!This product worked then did not work then worked then did not work...."
2,Pretty decent when (if) it works.,"Have had this now for about 6 months. Setup was fairly simple, but I have more pc knowledge than most. The problem is, the sound sometimes goes out for a few seconds. I'm sure this is due to the wireless network but it even goes out when there isn't any other wireless network usage but itself.Second and by far the biggest problem is, quite often the utility cannot find the bridge to connect to it. This is a real pain and a deal breaker. Even with the ip address set to manual and being able to log into the bridge's admin console, the utility still will not find or connect to it. Without being to connect to it, you cannot use it which pretty much makes it all useless.Last 2 times I had to re-setup the connection and it worked that day. Two days later, it cannot find the bridge anymore. If I could return this thing I probably would.Short and skinny is, it works good IF you can get it to work at all."
1,NO VISTA DRIVERS!,"This machine works well if you have XP and don't mind jumping through hoops to set it up. However, Linksys STILL has not released any VISTA drivers, so BeWare! This makes Linksys really look bad. Take note, you will not be able to use this product with Vista, so don't buy it if have vista."
1,Worthless POS perfomance does not justify set up hardships,Linksys should be embarrassed that they actually placed such a difficult to set up and problematic device into production. Only people with true tech savvy can get it to work and then only with constant maintenance.
1,Pain in the butt to setup and use,"I was able to set this up, but it's a huge hassle to use and as a result just doesn't get used. It now sits in a closet. Don't buy."
3,"Nice, but a bit skippy","Install was a bit more complicated than adding a new PC to the home network, but not as bad as some of the reviews I had read. I find that I have to engage the WMB54G as the audio output on my main PC BEFORE I call up my music player software in order for the unit to work. I am wireless from my PC to the router and wireless from the router to the WMB54G. When playing music, you get the occasional pause. I have tried various mp3 playing programs, no change. My new attempt will be to wire the WMB54G to the router and reduce the wireless path to one-way.I have a ton of music and I though this would be the way to manage and play it on my stereo, so far, yes, but not with the quality I want."
1,The worst book in my graduate course,"Don't buy this book.As a student with one of the authors and reader of the book from cover to cover, I feel confident to make my recomendation: Don't waste your money with this book. Try IEEE Proceedings special on Fuzzy Systems, the book from Zimmerman or go directly to the articles."
5,life stragities for teens,this book was purchased by me for my granddaughter. i read the book before giving it to her for her birthday she has read it and tells she finds it very helpful and has shared some of the book with her younger sister. i treasure any info that can help my grand daughters have a better life. lmr
1,He could poop in a cover and this would sell,"Look, the kids Dad is Dr. Phil. And good ol Dad constantly promotes his son's book on the TV show. By the way, this kid would never get published if it weren't for his Father's pull. Now this pampered rich kid is going to tell us how to make it in life? How did he make it? Daddy? This kid could take a poop and slap a cover on it and it would still sell like hotcakes. Why? Regardless of the fact that it's trash, his Daddy is a best selling author with his own TV show and nepotism is alive and well."
5,worth every cent!!!,k this book is the only book ive read twice!!!! it rules it really helped me sort my life out!!! i totally reconmed it!!! but u have to be willing to have it help u and have to pay attention while reading it to get all the benefits!!!! but i love it it's really worth it!! good luck
2,Simply not detailed enough,"Just from skimming through the book I saw that the life laws were important. I recognized my family's and my friend's behavior in Jay McGraw's words.Inspired, I read more deeply into the book and found, to my dismay, that it was poorly written. The 'life laws' are vague. From the get-go I understood that they were important, complicated factors of life that could not just be explained in two words or a catchy phrase. I hoped that the author would make up for that by going into deeper detail about them and how to twist them to your advantage. Sadly, I was wrong."
5,Life Strategies for Teens,"Life Strategies for Teens by Jay McGraw is a nonfiction book. In it the author talks from his own experiences and shares his own stories, as well as stories from other teens. One of the rules of life he suggests is: you need to ""get it"" which simply means in order to succeed in life you need to understand life. The one thing that I took out of this book was that you shouldn't let people walk all over you. Don't be a door mat.I could definitely relate to the things that the author talked about in the book. I have also done some of the things that the book talked about. For example, it tells you about denial. I used to be in denial about my life.I liked this book a lot. It was very good. I didn't really have a favorite part. I thought the whole thing was really good. I would not want to change any part of it.I would definitely recommend this book. Someone who doesn't really like to read story books, would like this book."
4,jack skellington night light,"great product. it is much larger than expected, and gives out a gentle, skeletal glow. a great and affordable find if you are a nightmare before christmas fan."
4,"A ""PRETTY"" GOOD BOOK!!!!!!",This book is the perfect book for any pre-teenager. It is about Beth and her summer adventurs at the farm in New Hampshire. As you read through the book you will soon find yourself in the middle of an adventure. This book really does have everything a young teen could as for...mystery...adveture...romance..ect!!! You cant but help liking this book. Pretty Penny Farm is deffenitly a book that you will want on your shelf. I recomend it to anyone looking for a good book!!!! I really is worth your time~!!!~
4,Beautiful Designs,"I own both this book and its sister (Volume I), and have the honor of attending quilting classes taught by John and his daughter Cissy.The designs in this book are elegant, and, unlike many designns by other artists, capture both the beauty and spirit of the flowers and plants they represent.The instructions at the beginning of the book are very helpful. My only complaint is that the overall print quality is rather low, so that it is hard to see the stich detail in some of the b&w photographs."
1,A PIECE OF CRAP NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!,"I used to enjoy Lisa Frank when I was a kid but the quality of her stuff over the years has really gone down! You don't get as much stuff as you see in the picture. The envelopes are nice, but the notecards are crap! The t-shirt paper is the size of a memo pad and the postalettes are really cheap and tacky looking. How are you supposed to write letters with those things? Also, those miniscule stamps are useless junk and who needs all that prism tape anyway? Even the box is just a cardboard piece of crap. Take my advice, don't buy this unless you see it marked half off! It's not worth the price. You'll be really disappointed because it's useless junk."
1,Do not buy this book.,"All i can say is that this author is some bitter hack, who tries to reduce George Harrison to the level of mediocrity. Very boring with no real insight or focus. Also it just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, brain, & heart."
2,Too much useless info,"This book has useless info on other rock stars he didn't work with, too much of his beatle days and Clayson disses him for putting Dhani in the Montessori school system. Try and get Harrison, which is a book on his life by Rolling Stone."
1,Get thee away from this book,"Thankfully I received this book as a gift - I would be upset had I paid money for this drivel.Clayson's knowledge of George Harrison's life is comprised mostly of information that has been hashed over a million times and recollections of people who had nominal contact with Harrison. However, write-arounds are not unusual in journalism; what is unusual is that a book with this little substance coupled with an alarming number of inaccuracies was published at all.My favorite ""error,"" as such it is? Clayson refers to Robbie Robertson of The Band as ""Jaime Robertson."" Now why, I ask, would someone who knows enough about Robbie Robertson to know that his first name is indeed Jaime refer to him as Jaime, also knowing that few but the most rabid fans of The Band would even recognize Jaime Robertson as Robbie Robertson?Pass this up. I wish I had a recommendation for a better Harrison biography, but alas. Guiliano's (spelling?) ""Dark Horse"" is no better, and in fact may be worse."
5,running away in style,Belinda Carlise's album Runaway Horses is so good that it ran away with itself. I have it on casette tape since it came out so now I want to upgrade it to a cd.
4,A Mature Belinda Carlisle,"This album was released in the early 90's when Belinda's career was still at a high point. MTV played ""Leave a Light On"" and Vh1 ""Summer Rain,"" two of the stand out tracks of this album. Her voice sounds more mature and for the first time she wrote a song- ""Shades of Michealangelo."" ""Valentine"" and ""La Luna"" add to the albums strength. The best song off the album was never released in the states though, the title track ""Runaway Horses."""
3,it will do,not exact fit had to modify opening.. looks better in picture I was disappointed that amazon allowed these poor descriptions. picture has nice even slight domed surface while mine is flat with sunken spots
5,Chrome fuel door.,After extensive shopping for one of these I can say this unit is the best made and best designed chromed fuel door I have seen. I have it on my 2000 Dodge and it looks great plus works great.There was a small problem with the chrome plating looking a little rough after about 9 months. Amazon honored the lifetime warranty and replaced that first unit at no charge. Installation was a little tricky because the instructions were less than clear but so are all the other brands. Everthing considered I am very happy with this unit.
3,Good for Advanced-Beginners...,"The book is excellent if you're just beginning to use ADO.NET and really want to know how it works. I wish I had found it two years ago but unfortunately, that's all it does. Error handling is particularily weak - comments like ""Once an exception has been caught, you can step through the error collection andlook at each error in turn"" are not very helpful. He gives very little guidance about what to do with errors once you've found them.In order to fully understand the book, you also need to have a good working knowledge of basic SQL already. And he definitely has a bias towards manual coding things and skims over the GUI and the Designer."
1,Weak Source of Information,"I felt the book was poorly written and lacked weight in places. Although the high level definitions were accurate, the detail was messy and the writing style was poor. The internet could give you better information and detail then buying this book. I gave it one star because at least the author tried to make the subject matter colorful."
4,cute ring,"cute ring for the money. just wish I had paid attention to the fact that it only came in one size and that size was 2 sizes smaller than I wanted. still, it is a cute little ring if you wear a size 7."
4,Good all weather flag.,"The flag is a good all weather flag that holds up well in wind, rain, and snow. I'd buy another."
2,Not worth the price/look at other brands,"This pump is usu. found on cheap models. It may be german designed but axial cam types are no where as good as the piston pumps esp. at higher pressures. The Italian AR ,for example has ceramic pistons and is much more durable and is found on many other brands and costs less.The Honda engine is very good however.They also are measuring that 4000 psi at the pump head,static max, which at the outlet, in use will be at least 500 psi less, and with that type of pump even less. It is not a heavyduty pump. Call a repair shop and ask. The gauge should be at the hose connection if you want to measure what pressure you are actually getting. All these manuf. over rate the pressures. Amamzon has better choices."
5,karcher 4000 psi gas pressure washer,"Wow... I got an amazing deal on this pressure washer. I've used it all year and it works great! Nobody had a better price, better product and faster shipping! Thanks for a really great pressure washer. It's made me enough money to pay for itself already. :)"
1,Nice cover but slightly over priced and over rated .,"Ok, I like the hardover Chicken Soup books. As an avid reader of Chicken Soup, I expect them to be just as good as the soft cover. However, this one was about one fifth the calibre. Not enough. Not enough stories. Not enough message for Grandma. No 101 stories that's for sure. Was a little disappointing. More like a gift for someone that you don't quite know well enough to give a REAL Chicken Soup book to~ lol. And certainly not enough for THIS Grandma! If my Grands gave me this, I'd have been VERY disappointed! Since I bought it myself, I have no one to blame but ME!"
2,Silly purchase,"I don't know why I ordered this set, as it's really too small to be of use. If you did use them, you'd have to refill the jars with candy very frequently.Not worth the bother, really."
1,LOT SMALLER THAN APPEARS,"this first aid kit is definatly not worth the money. it is way smaller than it appears, it is only about 4 by 5 inches. Bad choice."
3,great pouch not great stuff,the pouch itself is worth the money so i say go for it if you need a bag for samll med supplies. the stuff that comes inside though is dated and just plain useless hahah
5,Works Great!,"Black pen ink soaked into my friend's suede coach. I used WINK on each ink spot and it came off right away. I just put a little bit of WINK, water, and a soft rub. It comes right up. It's perfect."
2,"Got some ink out, but not enough","An ink stain on my bed cover. I applied Wink and rinsed repeatedly, and scrubbed at it with an old toothbrush. Wink got some of the ink out, but then couldn't do anymore. Unfortunately, the ink stain remains. It might have been able to do more if the ink hadn't dried."
5,I was stunned!,"My Mother gave me some of the ""wink"" ink remover once by rarely ever needed it. Once my room mate totally soaked his $70 dress shirt pocket with ball point ink. I mean Soaked! It was drenched in ink. He asked me if I had any ideas to get it clean. Well, we tried the ""Wink"" ink remover. To my amazement there was absolutely no trace of ink on the pocket. Incredible stuff!Jim B."
5,Wink WORKS!,"I have been using Wink since 1988 when first found it at a local craft shop. Wink works best when used on a fresh stain and on synthetics. It works on cotton as well but requires more rubbing. If you have hopes of it working on a permanent marker - it depends on the fabric. If on cotton - probably not all the way. Remember that heat SETS stains in fabric. Use cool water, NO dryer, and be patient. Some stains require multiple treatments -- do NOT use the dryer between treatments - just line dry. I've had lots of luck with a toothbrush or hand rubbing and patience. My first experience was with an ink pen that exploded on cotton shirts in a dryer -- it worked and I've been a true believer ever since!"
1,Not as advertised,"When I ordered this wink ,it said that it was safe to use on leather.After receiving this product;nowhere does it say safe for leathers.Only mentions cloth materials that need to be washed after applying this wink stick.Looks like I got stuck"
5,No more wet sheets!,My son's size 2-3 swaddlers weren't cutting it at night since he is a tummy sleeper. He was waking up drenched every morning and I had to change his sheets daily. I searched the local stores for overnight inserts or size 3 overnight diapers with no luck. The local stores only carried the Huggies Overnights in size 4 & 5. I found these on Amazon's site and promptly ordered them. We haven't had an overnight leak since and it's been 2 months. I highly recommend these!
1,Didn't work for my daughter,"Hi,Based upon the reviews, I got these for my 8-month old and found that these overnight diapers works the same as the regular diaper. I had to change her in the middle of the night since the overnight diaper couldn't hold any more. Very disappointed."
1,Soooo Disapointed!!!!,After all the great feedback I was certain that this was the answer to all my sons leakage problems. NOPE!!!! Didn't make a difference. I even tried to use a maxi pad as well to try and stop the leaking. To no avail. We're still waking up every morning drenched in pee.
4,This kicks @ ! Big time !,"This "" kids aren't alright "" single is the third release from Americana & yet another hit . This song is very good ( it's hard , so I like it) The guitarsolo's are very good . On the CD are 3 tracks : first & foremost the title track , then LIVE versions of ""Pretty Fly"" & ""Walla Walla"" . These 3 songs are also on Americana , but the later 2 are LIVE !!! So they're way cooler than their originals . It's definitely a sure shot ! Go for it!"
3,Gothic Fiction,"The stories in this collection are more like gothic horror, than contemporary horror. There are no big flashy scares here, but some of the stories are bound to stay with you after you close the book. My personal favorite story is the one about the woman who took her son to Ireland for a vaction, and ends up loosing her son, and gaining a changling. There's a very cool story about a cemetary that moves across a river also, and one that sort of reminds me of Shakespeare's Othello. If you like classic horror, you will love this collection, and even if you don't, but like anything to do with Ireland, you should still give this a try."
5,Great movie,I love this movie. I bought a second copy because my husband can use it as a tool for teaching.Gail
5,Great movie,"This is a wonderful movie, very family oriented. John Schneider, who is one of my favorite actors,does a magnificent performance. The ending of the movie is great. All of the actors are great, but since I favor John Schneider, I am partial to him. I only wish the movie would have gone into further detail abuot his friendship with the boys father and why the uncle was so adament against soap box derby racing. But the story has a great ending and you can let your imagination run and decide what happens after the end. I think it was one of the best movies I've ever seen."
5,You've Got a Friend,"This was a most enjoyable movie. I have watched several times and find it just as entertaining as the first time.Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a nice, clean (no foul language which is a rarity)movie. Actors were great."
2,Linsey,"I've taken several brands of Chlorella, this is just not a good one. It does not seem to be of high quality."
1,Seriously?,"Last time I checked, ALL living organisms had both RNA and DNA. I mean, DNA is what life is built from. If this company feels the need to promote their natural product as containing actual natural ingredients, then you might consider an alternative source."
3,Cute ring toss game,"I was surprised that the pegs are not secured into the bases - this is clearly to be able to pkg it all flat into a convenient tote bag. But for the young kids I purchased this for (19mos & 3 yrs) having the separate pieces just made the pegs into instant microphones, suckers, and xylophone sticks! They never touched the rope rings - they were thrilled with the pegs w/the big balls on the ends! So, they liked it, they asked to play with it-and its no problem for me they played with it differently than it's intended purpose. It was a success as far as we are concerned!"
2,Cutting Corners is Unfortunate,"This looked like such a great idea. It's too bad the quality isn't up to my expectations. Every part of this product is disappointing, from the too thin pegs and bases (separate pieces BTW), to the flimsy rings with poorly joined ends. I wish we hadn't used it and could return the whole thing. But alas, we're stuck with it. I'm going to make new rings and glue the other pieces together and make the best of it. Ring toss is fun, and being able to stagger the distance of the targets is a great twist. I encourage the company to revamp its product to be more sturdy and of higher quality for the same price."
4,Fun,"Bought this toy for my daughter's fourth birthday party. Boys and girls alike loved it.I am keeping it locked up for playdates and parties and family nights, just so that we have something 'new' to do together.So I don't know how well it keeps their interest over the long run.I only gave it three stars for 'durable', since the sticks come out of the hole easily. But I guess that's for storage.The quality otherwise seems fine, nice and vibrant colors."
5,Helps You Move On,Uncoupling: Turning Points in Intimate Relationships by Diane VaughanThis book won't save your relationship. It won't tell you what went wrong. It won't save your next relationship. What it will tell you is where you are in the process of ending the relationship. This process tends to be unstoppable and knowing that helps you accept the end and move on. The reason this works is that the book gives you a catalog of the types of break-ups and enough description for you to figure out which type is happening and where you are in the type. It is spot on to the point that you cannot fool yourself and you accept the inevitable and start the healing.This is a really good book to give someone who cannot get past their previous relationship or are dazed and confused about what is happening.
5,Illuminating.,"Without assigning blame to the ""initiator"" or the ""partner,"" Vaughan dissects the end of a loving relationship. Her book is as good as it is because she accomplishes this task with a sociologist's honesty and a storyteller's care.If you have fallen out of love with your partner, read this book. You won't feel accused, but you will understand where the two of you stand with one another. It may even help you begin to share your situation with your partner, before doing so becomes too difficult or simply irrelevant."
2,Excellent,"As I read this book, I felt a load lifting from my shoulders. During the intial chapters in the book I read from the ""initiators"" standpoint, but later I was not so sure whether I was the ""initiator"" or the ""victim"". I found I was both. My conclusion is that this book is primarily meant for someone who is either thinking about seperation/divorce or is already divorced. To get to that point the relationship is in decay and this book might help in understanding the roles of the initiator and victim in the relationship. It can help reduce the feelings of guilt or the feeling of self-pity, both of which are self-demeaning."
3,Book is ok...,"I didn't care for this book. I expected some analysis but also expected some tips for dealing with the ""turning points"". The books was an ok read ~ kind of boring actually ~ but didn't provide me with the guidance I was expecting."
5,Uncoupling: Turning Points in Intimate Relationships,"When I worked in Family Law for a Cert. Family Atty. we used to give this book by D. Vaughan to our clients because it literally derailed contention and unneeded additional legal costs of divorce because we knew you cannot punish the other person because a relationship did not work out! This sociological study is still relevant today and the components of relationships are the same whether you are married, living together, straight or gay. It helps to see where your next relationship will go. Because ""loving someone else means caring more about the other person then you care about yourself"" per another author, Belva Plain 2/88 WD. I have given many copies of the Uncoupling away myself. Casey"
4,"Sociology, not self-help","This book is a sociological study--it discusses processes and patterns that typically occur as relationships fall apart.As such, it does not provide solutions, fingers to put in the dike, compresses to stop the bleeding--in fact, it makes clear that most such measures are, finally, ineffectual.At the same time, every relationship is singular--statistics portray the behavior of groups, without necessarily predicting individual outcomes.If you are looking for a book that forces you to consider the individual and personal perspective in a damaged relationship, I strongly recommend ""Should you leave?"" by Peter Kramer.Nonetheless, it is both enlightening and depressing to recognize ""Damn, we've done that"" as you read this book.One final note: Ms. Vaughan's writing style is academic and often less than felicitous. The comparison between the liveliness and complexity of life shown in the quotations and her own dry, sometimes reductive commentary frequently annoyed me."
4,Excellent Charger!,Bought for my mother who has extremely heavy usage of audio equipments. She loves it. Takes a while to charge batteries but once charged they last for much longer time.
2,Not Good For Digital Cameras,"These batteries are only rated at 2100mAH of power and do not work effectively in a digital camera. On a full charge I was only able to shoot off about 10 pictures with my HP camera. RayOvac sent me replacement batteries, which did the same thing. I even used a different charger with the same outcome."
5,Better than the others - from a pilots view,"Using batteries for a back up navigation source while flying. These batteries and charger outlast and outperform the others, and Ive tried them all .. Buy it."
4,I hope this is not a fake,"This is a good Smokie's album, the first one without Chinn and ChapmanNot their best album, but a solid one.It also has bonus tracks (so-so)On thing I do not get about the CD - it has song names wrong.Instead of ""Too many pennies in hell"" it says ""Too MAY pennies in hell"".And instead of ""San Francisco bay"" it says ""San FRANCISO bay"",You can actually see it on the cover image supplied by Amazon.So what is it, a fake?"
4,Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Beyond the Basics Hands-On Training,I very like this book and wanna learning more this subject... hope u'll can help me to keep this book my own ... thx very much ...
2,What was she thinking?,"I love Catherine Asaro's science fiction novels. But this novel, The Charmed Sphere, is just not up to her usual standards at all. Tedious, repetitive and juvenile are just some of the adjectives to describe it. A very disappointing effort from an author I usually greatly admire."
3,Half-hearted magic scheme,"This is far from the worst book I have ever read, but it seems like a lackluster magic-concept. There was no explanation for WHY magic users worked through colors and shapes. Lacking any explanation of the mechanics of that, the concept just seemed... goofy. It felt like the author was thinking, ""I need a new method of working magic...oh yeah, colors!"" I understand that the main character, Chime, didn't really have a head for magical theory, but that doesn't mean the reader isn't interested. Are the shapes just a technique for the magic user to structure their powers? Are the colors symbolic of certain gifts? It just wasn't well explained or (apparently) well thought out.Beyond the hokey magic scheme, the romance was readable. It was interesting to have a main character who isn't the brightest crayon in the pack, knows it, but works with what she has."
5,It was the best book!,"I love this book. Chime and Muller were the best characters in the book. I wish the book talked more about Chime and Muller together. I would highly recommend this book to someone who loves science fiction, fantasy, and a little romance."
2,Not Asaro's Typical Good Work,"I love Asaro's other books, but this one is below her normal standards. Chime doubts her own abilities and is always down on herself. Muller doubts his own abilities and is always down on himself. Iris doubts her own abilities and is always down on herself. Jarid dowbts his own abilities and is always down on himself. Within moments of beginning each new chapter we learn that, yet again, the character in question is -- you guessed it -- doubting him-or-her-self and feeling down.The concept of mages who work through shapes and colors is a good one, but this world is far less vibrantly realized than Asaro's other worlds and, less than halfway into the book, you're ready to just smack these characters and tell them to grow up. Yet Asaro takes another several hundrdred pages for her characters to do just that."
2,There are certainly worse. . .,"There's so much really lousy fantasy out there that I generally try to read only those novels that come with strong recommendations. Because Asaro won the Nebula, I thought she would be a safe bet. I was sadly disappointed. While the plot is cute--neither compelling nor thoughtprovoking, but cute--the writing was an incredible disappointment. Her descriptive passages are so full of adjectives and adverbs that they seemed rather painfully juvenile and in a few parts, I had to stop reading and simply skip ahead to find out what happened. It speaks in her favor that I did want to find out what happened. But if clean and elegant prose is what you are looking for, this is DEFINITELY not the book for you."
3,Charming is a good word for it.,"I found this a pleasantly light read. One could even say fluffy. Although it was fun, it didn't live up to Asaro's reputation. All of the characters were a little thin, but I felt the villains were weak. Anvil the Forged, especially, became very indignant that his enemies actually stood up to him, and I thought that was silly. (Of course they stood up to him -- they were his enemies!) That said, I still enjoyed the book and will look for more from Asaro.Deby Fredericks, author of THE MAGISTER'S MASK."
3,not bad but not that good either,"This is an inoffensive story, the people are nice, the setting is pleasant, the romantic pairs love each other, etc. But there really wasn't a whole lot of suspense. I gradually just sort of stopped picking up the book, as I hadn't developed any curiosity about what would happen, and the last third of the book didn't get read at all."
2,Zzzzzzzzzz,"I don't know what to say. I agree with the other one and two star reviewers. I finished the book only by skipping over some sections. The characters are dull, the conflicts are boring. The 'magic' is just weird. Other reviewers say her other books are better, I'll try one of those."
3,"Pleasant read, nothing extraordinary","This was an easy reading book - I do not know what Asaro's intended audience was, but I would say that it would appeal most to high school girls (although there is a fair amount of sexual content later in the series). The style, plot, and feminine characters were somewhat reminiscent of Mercedes Lackey.I agree with other reviewers in that the setting of the story is not very imaginative, and that the most unique aspect was her take on magic. I have read several books in this series and this was actually one of my least favorite. I found the character Chime to be somewhat annoying, especially at the beginning. Based on this book, I probably would not have continued the series if I wasn't getting it from the library, but it does improve in my opinion."
3,Dope Debut Album from Bumpy Knuckles,"Dope debut album from freddie foxxx aka bumpy knuckles.I wouldn't call it a classic like the other guy but its definitely worth a look although you have to pay outrageous dough to purchase an original copy. Its a relatively short album with only 12 tracks and the quality aint all that. Best tracks are the uptempo tracks True Master & Stop, Look And Listen."
3,"""You rappers can't be like Fredd, and you hate it!!""","This here is Freddy Foxxx's debut album from '89. Even with production by Eric B, Foxxx's debut doesn't shine like when his alter-ego took over and transformed him into ""Bumpy Knuckles"", the world's most feared MC! The hottest joints here are; ""THE MASTER"", ""STOP, LOOK, LISTEN"" and ""I'M READY"", the latter being the hottest track and preview of what was to come. Sad to say, there's 3 love songs and a hand full of cheesey tracks. Foxxx fans will get this CD just for those 3 good songs."
4,Stop Look And Listen,This is a classic a must have for bumpy knuckles fans. Even though 80 dollars is a grip for the cd its a rare cd and very hard to find.
3,Forgotton classic production by Eric B. (without) Rakim,"This is before Freddie seemed to find his own voice and style as a rapper. He sounds heavily influenced by LL Cool J here. This is a far cry from the Foxxx of the Gang Starr Foundation and BDP crew days. The real reason for heads to get this are the dope old school beats by Eric B. When I listen to this I certainly find myself wanting to hear Rakim over these beats instead, but that is reason enough to make this worth a listen. This lost classic production (if not raps) is worth tracking down."
4,yeah it was with the $$$,"i finally copped this cd today,and it was well worth the dollars,freddie tears it up always,now i just have to get his first promo release""crazy like a fox"",but if you can cop ""is here"",thats dope too."
3,orbit,"Got it on time, shipped well, could have been cheaper but was the price I agreed to pay , Id recommend it"
3,Got more mic moves than Exlax,"Chunky A was a rapper who happened to be Arsenio Hall's ""little brother"" (wink, wink). His songs are mostly played for laughs, and they are actually fairly funny. ""Sorry"" is probably the funniest song, where Chunky cryingly apologizes to his girl for all the hilariously bad things he did. While this is more or less a comedy album, the last song here, ""Dope, the Big Lie"" is not played for laughs. This album is not a rap classic by any means, but it is one of the funnier rap albums ever recorded."
1,Can you say lame?,"I bought this album from a 99 cent store when I was in junior high. It was obviously Arsenio making all of that noise. I never understood why he even waisted his time. ""the hoe is lazy"" to the tune of ""she drives me crazy"" by fine young cannibals.....gay! Even as a young kid who sort of dug ""silly"" rap (NWA's automobile, Slick Rick's an indian story, etc.) this album just sucked. I was affraid my friends would see it so I hid behind my Vannilla Ice CD until I could take it to the pawn shop where they hopefully used it as a coaster (or for skeet shooting). I've got a lot of respect for Arsenio, and he is a funny guy, but damn!!! What a waste of studio time. Not recomended unless you have some realy good drugs to take with it (hoperfully something haluciangenic). Instead of giving this album two thumbs down, I'll opt to give it ""the finger""."
5,Unique and Fun CD,"I loved this CD. The Palast Orchester is really great and Max Raabe, the singer, is ""One of a kind"". His voice is beautiful but he shows so much personality when he sings. The singing is in German but that just seems to add to the overall liveliness of the CD. I find it so much fun to listen to this unique CD and though I have other CDs by this group that I love, this is probably my favorite."
2,Official Bootlegs?!,"I just got this today and I didn't read the description thoroughly. Turns out this isn't exactly professionally done, In fact it is basically a bootleg with an official presentation. These are DVD-R disks, not real DVDs! So $36 for 3 burnt DVD-Rs, none the less is it bootleg, its highway robbery also! I will be returning these as they are not what I expected. Sad because I love the show, but so far imo the 1st season is the only real release so far. Other than that the quality is good, but cheaper to download and make your own bootleg dvds!"
1,Online offer is dishonest.,"There is no online access with this book unless you pay another $25 per year! Oh, and this isn't made clear until after you are on the site to get the online access, after which you can't return the book. The cover of the book announces ""with online access"", with no caveats or warnings of extra costs.Dishonest online publisher deal makes the book less attractive.Amazon will take this back. We'll see."
2,"Nice TV, if it worked.","Same problem as others who have this TV (from other reviews/ forums)- When you turn on the TV, you get an incredibly loud speaker-damaging buzz that won't go away unless you unplug the set. The remote won't work until the TV has been on for about a minute. Viewsonic will make you pay to ship to California... I've only had this set for 4 weeks! Then it will take at least three weeks for them to decide whether to fix it or send you a replacement. I think if I had to do it over again, I'd spend a few hundred extra and get something reliable or at least something that the manufacturer will stand behind. Also, it seem like they have this same problem with TVs of the same series but different sizes."
1,It is NOT what I expected,"It is NOT 1200 mAh, but 850 mAh as they said.It is NOT Li-Ion battery, but Li-Polimar battery as they said.Overall, it works, but it's not what I expected."
3,tried to start it,"This was reco'd by a friend (an author, no less) whom I trust. Stopped when I couldn't get into it. Will try again."
4,It works fine to me!,"I read many reviews about this item (after buying it) and people said they weren't satisfied about the mouse's performance, and this made me feel worried, but when I received it my fears went away. Ok, maybe it's not the best mini-mouse ever, but it works pretty well in my Pavilion dv9060us."
1,Disappointed...,"When I found this mouse in a store for the first time, I thought it seemed to fit my hand without sampling. I decided to purchase amazon.com and got it, however, the quality was cheaper than the looks in the package. The worst thing is that it is hard to move a mouse pointer. The amount of the moving of the pointer is very short per one movement even though I changed to max to the movement of the pointer in control panel."
4,A delightful romp through the cafe-society life of Porter!,"He hid his obscure background. He emerged into a society which was pegged for him! And he lived to tell about it -- as did his friends.This is a collection of recollections about the inimitable Cole Porter, straight from the horses' mouths -- his family, his friends, his collaborators (which he denied having! Cole didn't see any reason not to write words AND music for everything!). It is witty and sad, frank and frivilous and fun. For insight into the life and talent of the man who gave us the songs we hum daily, we sing in the shower, and we spout lines from as if they were common knowledge, this is the source! A highly recommendable read, to be sure -- especially for those who love the music and sophisitication of the era!"
3,True to its name,"I have read a few in the ""Dummies"" series and found them to be very good, but not as high level as the titles would suggest. This book is, however, very high level. It is very basic. If you know nothing about DNS, this is the book for you. If you have a basic understanding of DNS, then I would not recommend this book."
3,So so..not real good not real bad,The book is so so. It's really not for anyone that doesn't have a working knowledge networks or computers. There are sections that are not very well-explained and i've run across grammatical errors.The book is not without some value but it could be much better written. I wonder if Mike Minasi has written any books on DNS...his books are usually pretty good. :)
4,Early Colonial Educational History,"I was attracted by the ""Early Colonial History - how educational institutions were formed and financed"" aspect of the book, and found it to be a great resource in that sense."
2,not for the autobiography but the naturalism approach,"The book is like "" Hatchet"" very well written,but it lacks any feeling for the nature the author describesthe boys raping. The community he lived in built a damfor electric power that blocked the upstream run of the fish.This author thought it was a great thingas it allowed him and his friends to catch more fish.Like I said the writing is candid and true to life, but it isa life of a child who never learned an real respect in thenative American ( Indian) tradition for nature.Survival at the price of destruction of speciesmay in the long run be the worst kind of survival?"
4,Champion 2000,I was disappointed that it was not as good as the old one because the connection between the motor and the juicer was not tight and leaks more.Also the tamper is a little too short so you can't get the food all the way into the blades.
2,"Great Trimmer, Short Lifespan","Loved the trimmer while it worked.Alas, it worked for only eight months. Then just quit. Am now trying to determine how to get it replaced; Wahl's website doesn't seem geared to help customers with those kinds of issues."
3,Works,This will be brief as I have used it only once. I bought it because it's NOT rechargeable. My last razor wouldn't recharge but would work if plugged in. It then died a month later.Now to this razor.It appears to cut well but is VERY noisy. You can go deaf trimming your sideburns.Should be OK if you trim the hairs on your toes.Good buy other than the noise.
4,"Acceptable Loss, Fufilling, Exciting and Rewarding","This book is more than a memoir of someone's war experience. It's complete and does several things well. Meet your author who enters the war a virgin with everything to learn but not knowing squat. Following him as he's thrusted into a shooting and dying war. Follow as he begins to make sense of surviving. Reading, you can't help but bond with the main character and begin to a transformation, from eager to learn, take chances and confront bravery as friend or foe. As his war continues we see a young soldier transform where he attempts to understand the politics of war which is where the title comes from. Jorgensen wraps up the book very well when he talks about what really happens when surviving men and buddy's rotate out. He discusses the horrors of war and the need of dealing with death. It a well written book that allows readers full circle look at a combat infantryman life."
4,Good real tales,"It is a good book written on the Vietnam war. The author, veteran from the Rangers volunteered for the LRRP engaged in Cambodia in 1969/1970. He succeeds in outliving 54 missions. The book is a a beautiful testimony of a great soldier."
4,Stunning!,"Written with common sense. Factual, but doesn't read like a reference guide. If you like the works of say, Mark Twian or Walter Isaacson, you'll like this writer's style. I believe it might out do ""Kill Me If You, You SOB"" because of the depth."
4,Obligatory reading for college students,"Read it in few days. Good literature (language, style, adiustation etc.). Also seems to be very true. I don't have the experience myself, fortunately, but it agrees with other sources. It clearly shows how idealistic and naive are young men thinking about war/fight and how painful is the real experience and process of loosing illusions. If they are lucky enough to survive. In my opinion this and other similar pieces should be a mandatory reading for boys old and young enough to think about enlisting. Not that I think it'll have much impact considering their natural immaturity and testosterone level :)"
5,Cute,Item arrived pretty quick and was very cute on my dog. I had to roll the legs up to keep it on him but that's ok.
2,cute but doesn't fit well,"These are cute but I will have to remake them to fit because they are so long for such a small Chi, but he does look cute in it if it stayed on. Smallest size does not stay on... way too long... as if for a dachsund."
5,Great book for newbies! :),"Great book! It starts as if you don't know anything, and then slowly takes you into advanced things. I highly recommend it, very much worth the purchase price."
3,I'm a 'Dummy',"I purchased this book for a computer class that I was taking at the time. The title is right on the money, in that it breads down everything so that a DUMMY can understand it. If you are computer programming illiterate like me, well worth the money and time to read."
3,"Book has lots of topics, but it is not organized and written well.","In the first section, I found TOO MANY geeky jokes and I found that very annoying. I know I read Sams teach yourself C++ in 21 days a few years back, and I felt at that time I got a pretty decent understanding. Now, even though I'm just trying to refresh my memory on C++, I feel the book does not do a good job of teaching me...That said, I like that the book has lots of topics, if I get only a general idea of stuff.I would recommend, though, to check out other books and get a glance through this book to see if you can follow it before buying this one..."
3,Not an easy book to read,"As an old software developer, I have 20+ years in software development with different computer languages except C++ and Java. That being said, I thought I will not have difficulty learning another computer language. This book packs with a lot more useful information than some other C++ books that I own. However, I often scratched my head and pulled my hair out trying to figure what the heck this author is talking about. At times, it seems to me like after given out a new example, the author decided not to waste time to explain it, and so he switched the subject and moved on to something else."
2,First program does not run!,"I just bought this book and now realize I should have paid more attention to the copyright date (2003)! I tried running the very first program and it does not work. The compiler log refers to programs or directories missing? I installed all of the files from the CD that came with the book as instructed. Being completely new to C++, I have no idea how to fix this problem! Anyone else experience this?"
2,Kindle version,"The figures are in too low a resolution to be read with a kindle even when enlarged.The CD which comes with the paper version, is not referenced as to where we can find the files on the internet.The authors personal web sites given, which typically give support material, do not exist."
1,totally disapointing,"Before I read this book I read ""C for dummies by Gookin"", it was perfect, clear, sequential, and VERY funny. I can now write C without guessing and stressing. Then I tried to read C++ all-in-one by Cogswell and was deeply disappointed. The humor is NOT funny, it's lame. The material is dry. It is written as though someone was trying to teach your 60 year old mother how to program C++. It's truly a book for actual dummies. Imagine that. No details or inner-workings are explained, complex ideas are ""brushed over"" and frankly after 120 pages it now lays in my garbage can. Very disappointed. Now I search for a new C++ book."
3,It's a Nice Reference Book,"It's a nice book but I would recommend getting it from your local library and saving your money. I brought it from barnes and noble then returned - it was at the library. Furthermore, I didn't feel like I needed it enough to keep. So I got a copy from the library and then when I was done with it I returned it. But if you a dummies fan then you'll like this one too."
1,Don't be misled,"The Title of this book is ""C++ All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies"".However after reading this book it is quite obviously aimed at users of Microsoft products on Microsft systems. C++ is a multi-system language and any book calling itself a ""C++ All-in-One Desk Reference"" should be demonstrating the language in a pure form, such as the excellent ""C All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies"" book by Dan Gookin.This book either needs to be rewritten to accurately reflect the title or the title needs to be changed to accurately reflect the content, maybe ""C++ on Microsoft All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies"".If you need to learn C++ in a pure form then find another title."
3,o.k.,"Capone shouldve been on this cut, G Rap is the rawest dude to ever to bless another cats track and shine better than the artist."
3,Not HDTV as stated,"I checked with the spec and Sumsung website, this is just a SDTV without HDMI input. This is definitely not a HDTV."
5,Spalding Gray at his best,"Incredible writer and monologuist Spalding Gray takes us on an incredible journey, around the world and through his soul. Though based on his his attempts to avoid dangerous eye surgery, the story is really about meeting fascinating characters and Gray's own fascinating neuroses. If the idea of a monologue sounds boring to you -- basically Gray sitting and telling you a story -- I especially challenge you to try this out.While dry, Gray's humor keeps you laughing out loud. You'll find it mesmerizing, and at the end of your own journey through the film, changed for the better. Highly recommended."
4,Gray's Anatomy.,"If you enjoyed ""Swimming to Cambodia"", then you will enjoy this film also. If you haven't scene ""Swimming to Cambodia"" buy this but watch ""Swimming to Cambodia"" first."
4,Rediscovered for the First Time,"I had seen a brief bit of this when I was younger and always wondered what movie that was where a guy just sits there talking to a camera. Well luckily, I accidently discovered it again. I wasn't sure a movie like this could actually carry more for 2 hours but when it was over, I was amazed that time had passed so quickly. Spawlding is a great storyteller, and you will not be bored, guaranteed. Now, how much of it is true? That I wonder. But who cares, 'cause movies aren't usually true anyway, even when they claim to be."
1,Soderbergh destroys Gray,"Steven Soderbergh apparently had no faith in Gray's storytelling skills, so you get 30 minutes of Gray, and 30 minutes of videotape of some people commenting on him.WHAT A WASTE!Ignore Gray's Anatomy, and check out Swimming to Cambodia, Monster in a Box, or even the HBO special Terrors of Pleasure. You'll get more Gray without the incessant need of Soderbergh to ""liven"" up Gray's monologue. These other films are Gray and Gray alone. He doesn't need an intrusive, meddling heavy hand like Soderbergh. Ugh."
2,Beware explicit content,"While Gray is a gifted story teller, this video is marred by profanity and stories of illegal drug use. Unfortunately this video carries no rating to warn viewers of this content. If I knew the this sort of material was in the video, I never would have purchased it."
1,Does NOT fit all gas powered pressure washers,"I purchased this item because the mfr said it would fit ALL Karcher pressure washers up to 2300psi. I purchased this item at the same time I bought a Karcher G2000MK 2.4hp pressure washer 2000psi which does not have a bayonet style pressure gun. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE ITEMS FOR USE TOGETHER. Your pressure washer MUST have a bayonet style gun to attach. As a result, I have no idea if this accessory works well or not as I could not use it for my driveway. Also, there was no manual shipped with the brand new attachement so I spent considerable time trying to find out why it wouldn't attach."
5,Takes you back to the 70's,The harmonies of Seals and Crofts are un-mistakable and enchanting.One of the best albums of the 70's and still works today.
1,The LED light will go out,"We purchased three of these, from different vendors and at different times. In all three, eventually, one of the led lights stopped working in less than a year. An ""in warranty"" repair will still cost about $5. plus shipping. The rating is one star because you can still use it with one led light. Also, this is one of the few lights on the market that actually focuses the light correctly on the entire keyboard."
1,"If I could rate this 0 stars, I would have","Within 2 months of using this, the LED lights burnt out, I figured no big deal b/c I work in an office where there is like 60 FC, so the lights did no good anyway. . . however less than a month later, the fan knocked out. Not pleased about spending 16 bucks and it only lasting 3 months."
5,Bachata is the world's sexiest dance,"Bachata is the world's sexiest dance that was banned in Cuba for a few years. Of course that only encouraged the interest in this dance. Can be done apart in two-hand open position, normal closed hold, or chest-to-chest Latin style. In this dance, as in all Latin dances, the ""Cuban motion"" is most important, and they spend some time on these moves. This DVD also has an introduction to Merengue. The DVD in one hour and 45 minutes long, and at $29.95, that is a good value. One thing I discovered is that Bachata can be danced to various music, not just Bachata music. I have danced it to slower Salsa and Merengue music.Covers: crossbody leads, hairbrush, inside and outside turns, men's turns, free spins, cape position, skaters, dips, pivots, and many others. I recommend this DVD, although it is somewhat conservative vs. the passionate styles of other Bachata instructional DVD'S."
4,Sensitive Portrayal of Mental Illness,"""David and Lisa"" is a touching portrayal of adolescent psychosis and love for the first time. Kudos To Frank and Eleanor Perry for not exploiting mental illness by the restraint in which they tell this story and not resorting to the histrionics that lesser hands would have resorted to. Keir Dullea is fine as David, the youth with OCD, though I thought him a little mature for the role and a little Brooks Brothers. Janet Margolin is a revelation as Lisa, the child-like teenage schizophrenic. Howard DaSilva delivers solid work as their sensitive psychiatrist. Unlike alot of social dramas of this period it holds up remarkably well."
4,a good film but dated,"This film is something of a double edged sword. While it is very well prsented and sensitivly acted,what we have learned about mental illness reneders it somewhat backward. Remember that in 1962 schitzo affective disorders were through by many to be caused in part by a patient's upbringing. You know, their parents did this to them. In the film, for example, David's mother is presnted as rather rigid and autitorian. We now know that mental illness is just that-an ilness, caused by chemical imbalences in the brain. The two teenagers in the film were treated by psychotherpy, which is completely usless in treating schopherina. As I said, the film is well acted. Janet Margolin in paticular gives a haunting performance as a child like spirit-almost like a creature from another world. But as a serious examination of mental illness, it falls short."
3,"quoth noel coward : ""keir dullea -- gone tomorrow""","half a century ago, psychiatry was still considered new and exotic, and was prime grist for ""meaningful"" movies. this was one of the big hits of the genre, with a pre-2001 keir dullea and janet margolin as overage teenagers struggling to overcome their awful lives with the help of friendly doctor howard de silva (no longer a communist, but not yet benjamin franklin). it is a sincere and well-intentioned effort, tho nowadays strikes us more as a relic than relevant."
1,Very Poor Quality,Ver Poor quality the container was broken and the dvd was all scratched. I should return this item. Very unhappy and disappointed.
3,i liked it but she didnt,"my daughter is 13 months now, she likes to watch t.v so ithought to buy her this dvd, however it didnt attract her attention at all, maybe she is still young for this dvd."
2,Incorrect product description,This is a nice bag for a small digital camera. Your description said it was a large Digital camera bag. I purchased a large Digital bag from another vendor. My Canon Rebel XT fits perfectly. Do not purchase this bag if you are looking for a large bag that would fit a Canon Rebel Xt.....Other wise it is nice bag.....
1,Worst of the Back to Mine series,"I own several of the CD's in the Back to Mine series, and this one is the worst, far and away. The majority of the songs are real lemons, and they don't flow well together (very disjointed). The song list looked interesting on the screen, but to my ears it is not a pleasant mix at all."
2,Tiring,"I love love love the dictionary feature on the Kindle. But this book brought an end to the enjoyment I usually find in looking up words and their origins.This book offers LOTS of words to look up. Lots. And lots. And some more. I get that the writing style is in character for Peppe, the ""author"" of the memoirs, but the extreme overuse of pretentious and obscure words (often not found in the Kindle dictionary, and I am not refering to any of the Latin and Italian) is just plain tiring. Much of what happens and many of the historical characters are humorous and quite ""earthy."" I would really like to have followed along with Peppe through the Reformation, but I just lost interest in continuing because of the writing style. I moved on to ""Creatures of the Empire: How Domestic Animals Transformed Early America"" by Virginia DeJohn Anderson - a book which I really would recommend."
1,Horrible,"I cannot believe I actually paid money to read this book. It was a ""Kindle Daily Deal"" for only $1.99, so I thought why not?I do not understand why this book has such glowing reviews. The author is a little too enamored of his extensive vocabulary (which is fine, because I enjoy using big words myself - but when I can't even find what the word means in the dictionary...that's just too pompous for words).The book itself was not interesting or engaging in any way. I kept pushing myself to read it, since I had spent money on the book. It never got better. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
3,"Great idea, but...","I really thought this would be good on so many levels, but unfortunately the only part that lived up to my expectations was the historical setting and overview of this era of the Catholic Church. The front story didn't really hold up and the Gnostic elements were sparse."
2,Seemed To Go Nowhere For Me,"The dwarf seemed to recounting his life for no other reason than he could, much like today's celebrities, though perhaps the dwarf is more interesting. And the author does give him an interesting life, but I quickly found I really didn't care because it sank to the depths of bizarre depravities which seemed to be there only to do the opposite of tittilate. The author uses an excessive amount of words that my daughter would call $10.00 words, big, multi-syllabic monstrosities. I consider myself fairly well read with fairly good lexicon, but I needed a dictionary for almost every page of this book to get through it and several words even Google couldn't give me an answer. Stephanotic anyone? I was very grateful when I finally reached the end."
1,This is obscene.,"I should have read the blogs. If I hadn't paid money for the book, I would not have finished it. Makes a mockery out of any decent, moral beliefs. Even the cover is spiritually immoral."
2,No- it's not okay,I never write reviews because being an avid reader-I would rather read -but this book is-was-will be a disappointment. Glad I purchased it on a daily deal or my disappointment would be greater. After reading the reviews & the credentials of the author I had high hope s for the book. The best review I read was by N . Andreassen And he only touched on the glaring problems of the book.
3,OK as a supliment,"If you're taking a basic topology class (or any other abstract math class), it is usefull to have other books to reference. This book was only OK as a supliment. I found that you had to be careful the definitions, as some topologists will axiomize ideas differently (I found this happened the most when dealing with seperation axioms). I found that there are a few dover books out there that are a little more readable (Gemignani's, Mendelson's and Willard's books all come to my mind). This book won't hurt, but there are other options within it's price range."
5,Great,I liked it because it delivers the information in a piece by piece method.The book was in excellent shape.Shipment took about 3 weeks.Everything Good
4,Excellent,This book was more then romance. Adventure. Interaction with others. Character. Held my attention. Highly recommend to others. Looking forward to reading more of this series.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This is just a piece of plastic with a strip color stickers on it, worth about 25 cents. I had this toy when I was a kid, and wanted to share with my kids, it was made much better and had gems stone on it; that made the trick look and feel better. Keep searching this is not the one for your kids or adults. Here watch this youtube video [...]Thanks"
3,magic stick,this is a easy to learn magic trick my 6yr old had a little trouble but all and all its a good trick
2,Ceap and chearful,"The regular selling price for this item as suggested by the manufacturer is $5.00, so even though this is being sold relatively inxespensively it is still over the price you should expect to pay. Easy magic, but requires some practice. I would put it in the age 12+ range."
1,Terrible.,"As some have said in their reviews the camera dies way too quickly. I don't know whether this was just with my camera but sometimes when I would take pictures the LCD screen would turn green and I would have to turn the camera off and back on again. Even in a lit room the LCD screen would be seemingly dark. The only way I could actually be able to view something so that I know whether or not I am getting a good snapshot of a picture is if I am outside in the bright sunlight. My camera is now broken because somehow the LCD screen has a crack on the inside of it which I don't see how this could have happened seeing as how I never really took my camera anywhere. When I called Polaroid to see if it could be fixed they gave me no information whatsoever. They only repeated back to me the obvious, which was that it was, well of course, cracked on the inside. Luckily I got the camera as Christmas gift though I believe my father only bought it because it was cheap camera."
1,Is this thing even supposed to be a camera?,"Maybe if this thing was designed to be a play-toy for preschoolers it might be okay. Read the review by Regular College Kid and it is completely accurate. Some people wrote a good review for this camera, but you must remember - there are a lot of not-very-smart people in this world. I was especially surprised by the reviewer who wrote that the washed out colors and blurriness were ""artistic"". Nobody wants a camera that has washed out colors and blurriness! Any room short of something really well lit will result in a black display on the LCD. You can refer to Regular College Kid's review for all the info you need to know. Luckily this camera was free. I think i will use it for target practice or run over it with my car, just to avoid passing it on and frustrating another user."
2,"Eh, not that great.","This was my first digital camera. I bought it with rather high expectations, thinking that at 3.2 mega pixels it would have rather good display and other qualities. The things that bothered me most were the over-bright flash (which washed out the color of every photo I took with it, even outside at night) and the inadequate zoom. The display was pretty good for a camera at this price, but many things could've been improved. My advice to you: look around a bit more before settling on this camera. You may find it wasn't what you expected."
1,A waste of money,"This camera sucks, thats all i can say about it. One thing not mentioned before, you have to be super still to take a clear picture, otherwise the slightest shake will produce the worst distortion of your face ever."
1,Read the reviews.,"Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures."
1,HORRIBLE CAMERA,"I was in Walmart looking for a digital camera, and came across this cute little thing. I saw it was a 3.2 MP, being a decent picture. I was sold solely on the compact look,the price and i assumed it has alright quality. (the pic's took ok in the store but only b/c of how bright it is in there)I got it home, and took a few shots, they were no good. so i thought id keep it for the weekend and play around with it, thinking i needed to get to know my camera. WRONG!! this thing doesnt get better!!! its horrible. the quality is crappy. the pictures blurr. the flash is delayed for 10 sec. u cant take a pic closer than 5 ft away from object (ex. fun pics of u and ur friends/family where u hold it out in front on you) the pics will come out white!!! BAD BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!! BEWARE"
1,pfft.,"this camera is a piece of junk. you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture. and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out. not to mention the battery life is horrible. i got a 1 GB memory card so i could take lots of pictures, but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all, if you're considering buying this thing, save the money and frustration and just don't."
1,horrible - stay away,"How far Polaroid has fallen. Selling this ""camera"" with the brand name ""Polaroid"" on it is an insult to the hard work and dedication of all the people who ever worked there. Here are the positives: Light weight, durable, easy to insert and remove the SSD memory card. Here is the negative: TAKES HORRIBLE PICTURES. I mean bad. Really, really terrible. I'll try to link to one of the actual pictures taken with this camera (not sure if Amazon will leave the link intact). Note the 'Fun House Mirror' effect, too: [...]"
1,I can't believe Amazon sells this camera yet,"I bought this to be a small knock-a-round camera, to take with me when I wasn't in controlled conditions. That bill it filled exactly. However, I did expect some decent pictures out of it. Basically, picture wise, it is pathetic. It's easy to use, but takes horrible pictures, and the flash is all but useless. A total waste of money, considering you can get a Kodak for about the same price, which gives far superior picture quality. Don't waste your money. Buy something else, or just don't buy. Shame on Amazon for continuing to sell something this bad."
3,very basic but works,"After i bought the camera i went to amazon and looked at the reviews and was wondering if i made a big mistake, well i wanted a basic cheap camera for a friend so i bought this one. well the camera came and i was expecting something that took horrible pictures, well suprise..,,,, i tested it by taking a couple of pictures and was quite surprised the picture came out well, people u must read the instructions, inside photos u MUST use the flash and people or objects must be a few feet away and the flash works fine no whiteout. in no way is this camera for zooming in on stuff or taking really good photos for special occasions . the megapixel is just not enough for that . its great for a simple small photo of let say yourself or friends. Very basic and small but works."
1,3.2 MP? I think you mean -0.00 MP!,"A few years ago, my first digital camera was purchased. This camera happened to be Polaroid iZone 300. Well, I regret even touching this pathetic thing. My camera phone takes better pictures than this. This camera can't even take a perfect picture in the house. When I wanted to take my Myspace pictures, I had to be in the bathroom, which had about six or seven lightbulbs. This camera is a disgrace.Ladies and Gentlemen, do not purchase this camera. Look at all the reviews. This digital camera is horrible. Pictures look terrible. Things are too dark, and rarely too bright. A typical Polaroid product. What ever happened to, ""Just right""?"
5,Let me read reviews,I just bought the camera. I want to read the review that's already here. Can't seem to be able to do so.
3,good enough for the price,"I got this camera around a year ago for christmas, its a good camera for the price. You usually always have to have flash on which can get a bit annoying, considering no one wants to be blinded by the flash. This isn't a camera that you just mess with it and you know how it works, people, actually read the directions.This really should just be used for snapshots, dont buy it if you plan on taking high quality pictures with this thing, it just wont work. The size is good, it doesn't break easily. Its mainly a kids or teens camera, if you want a really good camera, you're price range will have to be, at the lowest, around $150.So for the price, its not that bad."
1,Great product... if you don't want to take pictures!,"I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera!She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and ""cool"" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!)"
4,it is a nice camera,"im a 13 year old girl that gets mad easily. i did not get mad over this thing.i dont know what other people are talking bout when it doesnt work. i got mine yesterday and it took great pics. the only prob. is that you cant see what you r taking a pic of in the dark. the beep turned off right when i press it to stop. i did not know that there was a video thingy but it was cool. the thing w/ that is that u need light cause that doesnt have flash. other than a few things, IT IS THE GREATEST CAMERA I HAVE HAD!!!!!!!!"
1,Not worth the money,"I got this free when I bought a laptop late last year, and even then, it's barely a value at that price.As other reviewers have said, the picture quality (yes, at the highest quality settings) is barely better than the <1 MP camera in my cheap-o cellphone. Whether using the flash or taking in a well-lit environment, you'll still need a rock-steady arm to avoid getting a big blurry mess.I had hoped this little free camera, cute as it was, would at least help me get by after my old Fuji 3MP camera was stolen. I didn't expect it to match the Fuji's quality, but this extreme difference is inexcusable. Instead, I've gone back to using my 35mm film camera and scanner.If you actually decide to pay money for this camera, well, I feel very sorry for you. Please spend a few bucks more and find a REAL camera..."
1,THE WORST CAMERA I EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this camera for my birthday last year and...let me tell you...DONT GET IT!!!!...this is what i dont like about it...1. that annoying beeping noise it makes while taking a picture.2. you take like 5 pictures and the battery dies!!!3. (i) cant recharge it with the wall adapter thing...4. pictures dont show up good on the screen.5. well...its just a peice of junk!
4,Good starter camera - don't listen to the negative reviews,"I purchased this camera for my sixteen year old niece. It's only a 3.2MP so the picture quality isn't as good as a 5.0MP, however, 3.2MP is above average quality. This is a great starter camera for a young person or teenager. It's compact, has easy to use menu items, and a cool charger base. The batteries run out a little too fast but so do the ones in my expensive 5.0MP camera. It's the nature of the beast...The person who wrote the review about the pictures being to dark didn't turn on the flash. The flash must be turned on in low light. If they had read the directions, they would have figured that out. Once the flash is turned on the pictures come out perfect.Don't hesitate to buy this affordable camera for someone as a starter. It is a great device.I gave this ""4"" stars because of the price, features, and slim body. I thought ""5"" stars was too high because it is not for a serious picture taker, it's a great ""first"" camera."
1,a complete disappointment,"For years I have had my old Samsung Digimax 300 of 3.2 mp, And let me tell you that is a pretty good camera, I'm using even now, and the quality of the pictures it is great, so, when my brother gave me some weeks ago the Polaroid Izone 300 I was very exciting about my new camera, cos I thougth this one it could be the choosen one to replace my old camera.But the whole thing it was a complete dissappointment, I mean, I can not compare the quality of the pictures of my old Samsung Digimax (it is almost 4 years with me!!!) with this new one Polaroid iZone.So if you are looking for a new, cheap and good Digital Camera, I suggest to buy a Samsung Digimax, maybe of 5 mp, you can find it here, in amazon for less than US$ 100 I think... actually I am very exciting cos I am waiting for my new Sony Cybershot DH 2, a more powerfull camera than my old Digimax, so I think that camera will be a decent replacement of my old camera, but avoid to buy this one, trust me!!!"
5,This book is a MUST READ!,This is one of those rare books that I wished would never end. I was not ready to part with the characters. This story will be forever in my heart and mind.The author has an outstanding talent for telling a story. Her insight into people and ability to put it into words is a true gift to the reader.I am anxiously awaiting the next novel by Mary Hartford Bruce. It can't come soon enough!
1,"leaky, awful diapers","What good is a diaper if the crib sheets and your child are soaked every morning? I thought I would try these out being a first time mom, but I quickly learned that these were horrible! I switched to pampers and have had no leaks whatsoever, which is much better for my daughter, and a lot less work for me."
2,"Buy Pampers, these leak.","I have raised 7 babies and tried every name brand and off brand of diapers over the years. Huggies and Luvs were the worst name brands, do yourself a favor and buy Pampers. If you like off brands try White Cloud or CVS they both work well."
2,Newborn?,"Our baby is on the small side (8lb 6oz now) but these are still to big. We are already on to Pampers size 1. Maybe the Newborn Huggies will fit when she gets a bit bigger. Also, we are not a fan of cartoons all over the diapers. Who are the cartoons for? Our 6 week old could care less."
3,Photo is not what I ordered,This photo is not the item I ordered. The item I recieved actually had tulle bows with stones on the stems of the glasses.
2,disappointing,"I saw this at Walmart on sale and thought it was worth a try. Wrong. The game picks which piece you're supposed to play and ends the game but everything else is up to the player(s). Unless you have two kids who can play a game and never argue, forget playing the game according to the rules. The best use for the game pieces is probably converting them to a solitaire puzzle (example-using 2 of each to see how many ways they can fit into a 5x8 segment rectangle.)"
4,better than expected,"Having watched The .hack//sign series and loved them, I didn't know what to expect of this series. The last volume has great action and even a battle scene, but the ending like the .sign series leaves something to be desired."
5,Great design,"I've had my Taylor professional digital timer/stopwatch for 5 years now, and it's still going strong. I really like being able to hang it around my neck when I have to leave the kitchen - and it faces the right way when I pick it up to check the time remaining. I'd hate to have a clip instead; those are often flimsy and easy to knock out of position. The magnet sticks firmly to the fridge when I'm not using the timer, so I always know where to find it.The only vaguely negative thing I have to say is that although the display is adequate, I'd appreciate larger numbers. [EDIT May 5, 2010: This product seems to be an updated version of the one I got 5 years ago, and the numbers are indeed larger than the one I have. Yay, Taylor!]This is a must-have item for anyone who doesn't want to hover around the kitchen so's not to miss the timer going off. When my mom used mine, she went right out and got herself one!"
1,Don't invest in this timer,"This timer starts out ok but then doesn't last more than about 5-6 months. The display fades and it doesn't help to replace the battery. The beeping is not particularly loud. I hate buying things that then need to be thrown away. Recently bought Polder Clock Timer 898-90 which seems to be a much better product, but I haven't had it very long to know how long it will last. The beeper is louder and it has more functions and is very light weight."
3,What did you say???,This was truly the answer to cooking and wandering all over the house. But the sound is just too weak. I sometimes put it inside my tea shirt so I can bend over without knocking it around and then you can barely hear it. I showed it to a friend who was looking for just such an item and he too said the sound was too weak. He is in his forties with no hearing loss. I am in my 80's with some hearing loss. Other than that I am happy with the product.
4,Battery Lasted Over a Year,"Have had no problems with this timer...has held up after being played with by kids. Battery ran out almost a year after I purchased it, but I had one handy because this timer uses a common battery that I found at the dollar store :LR44 1.5v (AKA: SR44,SR144,SG13,AG13,A76...)"
1,NO extra loud alarm as claimed!!,"This is supposed to be Chef quality and supposed to have an extra loud alarm. I don't know how a chef could hear this thing, I can barely hear it!! It is easy to operate and I like the strap, just wish I could hear the alarm!!"
1,Taylor Chef's Digital Timer,"Junk!! The timer worked well for about a week. Now the basic mode does not work. I'm hanging on to it in the hope that it will ""right"" itself again. Insanity you say? Maybe!"
2,looks like it would be a good timer,"The search was for a timer that was not piercingly loud. For this the timer was on target. It did have promise due to an interesting design. However, it was not very well made. The battery came out and we could not get it back in. It was for a meeting where different people would take turns using it, but the operation was not very intuitive. We decided not to use it."
1,It didn't work at all,"Right out of the box this timer did not work. It was worthless. I pressed the minute button, the minutes did not change like it was supposed to. I pressed the start button, it did NOT start the timer. It was a waste of my time and money. The product packaging talks about ""thermometer"" although this is a timer. Spend your money on something else. This product is worthless."
3,"works fine, but not as promised","While this works fine as a stopwatch and timer, it is described as having an extra loud ring. It is not. The ring is soft and so is not suitable for those with difficulty hearing."
4,Taylor Timer,"I love the convenience of it being around my neck but the timer, on the loud setting, is still to quite especially in a work enviroment. In addition, the battery for mine only lasted five days, very dissapointing."
2,OK stopwatch,"does job as advertised, nothing special about this stopwatchSpend a little more money and buy a more complete stopwatch if you are planning to use the device on a consistent basis."
5,Wonderful book,"I purchased this paperback, I would guess at least 20 years ago. Probably when it first came out in a store in North Carolina. It was the best bread machine cookbook I have ever bought and I have quite a few. I always keep going back to this one. I wouldn't trade it for anything. Naturally I have my favorites, but most of the recipes come out great and I don't have one of the newer bread machine's. Sometimes it takes a time or two to adjust the liquid, flour and yeast, but very little tweaking is necessary. I was delighted to see it is still in print. I also bought at the same time ""Bread Machine Magic"" Book of Helpful Hints that is as useful as my other one. I cannot recommend them highly enough. If you have one of the newer machines I'm sure the updated version will work very well."
5,My two boys love this book!,"I have two boys (2-years old and a 4-years old). Every night they usually get three short stories, but they are willing to trade 3 of these stories for the this one longer story book of Mulch the Lawnmower.They both love lawnmowers as it is, and to hear a story about them is just that much better.I think they really love the bright colors of the full page illustrations.No only is the story intertaining, but there are several positive themes in the book as well.- Try your best- Help your friends out- No job is ever too big to try- Payoffs for hard work- Being a team playerOverall my two boys love the book and want to know when there will be more adventures of Mulch and Rider!"
4,small technics make big differences,"It only took me 30 seconds to buy the book after I scan the titles of the chapters in a fantasitic bookstore in middle Taiwan...all matter to me even if I am a Taiwanese who's so different from those who are supposed to read it.The subject is so universal that,after wandering among the shelves for hours with limited budgets, I decided to take it. The book provides us with so many tips and give us so many substantial thoughts and agendas that a man has to take to make himself rich, materially and spiritually. I am so amazed that,even books about the same subjects in the books are countless,this is a real DIFFERENT book which is written on basis of the authurs' financial expertise and their ideas of helping people, withour meaningless preach and crabbs. This book is a real life bible. I am so glad that I have it."
1,"If you want to learn how to be a cheapskate, then this is the book for you","This book should be retitled, ""An Idiot's Guid to Being Cheap.""The title of this book led me to believe that this book would tell me how to better myself. Instead all I got was extremely basic financial and business advice and a lesson on how to penny-pinch."
3,Frommer's Kauai,"This particular book is the typical Frommer's edition. It gives the places that the staff have visited and reviewed. I wish it would delve into more of what the restaurant, hotel, or tourist attraction has to offer."
2,ok,"I previously purchased the Frommers for all the Hawaiian Islands back in 2001 and remember it being a great guide to the islands. So I was excited to see that there was an entire Frommers just for Kauai. I have to say, I think this book is weak. It could be so much more. I'm not sure how helpful this will really be compared to the complete islands guide I had in 2001."
4,Good book before you go,I got this before going to Hawaii and it is a great book. You don't realize how valuable it is until you get to Kauai and then wish you had it with you. Be sure to take it with you when you go. There is no way to remember all the things you want to see and do when you get there.
5,Outstanding!,Wow! I havent heard an indie album this moving ever! Cecelia's amazing voice and lyrics really hit me. I bought this on a whim from a recommendation of a friend of a friend of a friend and I'm really glad I did! I can't wait to see them live!
4,Cute but stretched out...,"This was a really good book. Some parts of the plot were so obvious,but only occur in the last 5 pages or so. Like others have said,I think that Ruby's adoption was just a way to lengthen the story,because once I got to that part,it went really slow. I didn't really see the relation between that and the whole idea of the book. I would have loved to cut out some of the adoption parts and have seen more of what happens to Lou in the end! There's only about one sentence that refers to her and the guy she ended up with but that's all. Besides that,it is a good read,and I like how it's essentially 3 stories in one (Ruby's,Lou's and Martin's)."
1,Um...,"Now, I definitely might be wrong, but I am fairly sure Barry Manilow didn't sing the Pina Colada song, someone named Rupert Somethingorother did, so unless there are TWO pina colada songs, which I just don't see, since the Pina Colada song was about meeting someone (his own wife!! SCANDAL!!) through online dating, maybe someone could have been a little bit more careful about fact checking.I mean, did he WRITE the song or something? I know he writes that songs that make the whole world sing and whatnot, but I don't believe he penned this one. Sorry.Oh, other than that, the book is several kinds of awful. Proceed with caution."
2,working class thin man all banter no charm,"I like Bix, I like British humor, I like Nick and Nora. So what is wrong with this picture? It is tediously slow, totally contrived and all the characters are soooo droll except for one cop who is the foil. Nick and Nora cracked wise right over people's heads, insulted people with finesse, and were terribly snobby. Every single person in this lacklustre production has a a go at cuteness. Where are the morons? I watch it when I am so tired I cannot think and it is mildly, oh so mildly, amusing.If you can get it cheap, why not, but otherwise, try old movies....or listen to Bix or to Chet whom Parker referred to as Bixated."
4,King Snake releases another 'cool compilation!',"Florida's King Snake Records is renowned for its eclectic stable of uniquely stylish blues musicians like Sonny Rhodes, Bill Wharton, Ernie Lancaster, Dr. Hector and the Groove Injectors and many more. The quality and scope of these lesser-known but fine artists attract major guitarists eager to perform or record with them. King Snake's aptly named new compilation 'Hurricane' showcases the hottest of these musical mergers. Discover Floyd Miles with the Allmans' Dickey Betts, James and Lucky Peterson, Chicago Bob Nelson with Tinsley Ellis, Smokehouse with Kenny Neal, or Alex Taylor with young slide sensation Derek Trucks. Excellent stuff, and with 19 tracks, there's lots of music for your money."
2,Badly Organized,"The manner of this book's organization makes it really useful only if writing something directly in German. Any other use and you find yourself going through the entire book to find what you're looking for. The book is categorized into thematic areas (eg attributes of character, criticism, dislike). Example sentences are provided, w/ translation, and occasionally the origin of the phrase, which is quite interesting and the only instance of that I've seen. A lot of good information here, It's just not organized intuitively. Cassell's Colloquial German recommended over this one."
5,DeWalt Circular saw kit,I really enjoy using the saw. It is a very good product to use in my workshop. It saves me a lot of time when I'm busy.
3,Disappointing bus ride!,All of the chapters in this book have already been published in See Rock City and Listening for the Crack of Dawn. I enjoyed those works. I was disappointed when I discovered that Ride the Butterflies did not contain any new material.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this thermos, it drips like crazy. I was trying to pour my coffee and it spilled all over my shirt. Then I was talking to this totally hot girl who would not bang me because of the stain (also because I had like a half bag of cheese doodles stuck in my beard, and I smelled like cheese). So unless you want to be a 37 year old virgin like me, with a beard full of cheese doodles, and pockets full of cheese, do not buy this thermos"
1,Not for any teenager I know,"All the reviews seem to be from adults/friends of the author. I read this as part of a mother daughter book group, as an adult - I would not choose this for my own reading. The references to places and movies and actors from the eighties would not be anything the girls could relate to. For example - his hair looked like Scott Baio - My daughter would assume the reference was to a classmate... So many references to how fun and tasty alcohol is and how smoking pot is so much fun - at 14 - with NO consequences. You must be kidding me. Maybe thats how it was in the eighties, but hopefully not for my daughter. If you are a parent selecting a book for your child - there are SO many better books out there of this genre, that won't make smoking and drinking quite the given that this one does. Definitely not for teens - and too infantile for adults."
4,A Lovely Read,Jenny Pollack's Klepto is a really light lovely read. It's a wonderful and insightful look into those troubling teenage years. Pollack did a fantastic job of capturing so much of what a teen is going through while still writing for a much broader audience.
2,for collectors only,"Some music stays unreleased for a good reason. I already own a good 30 to 40 recordings by ""Uncle Jim"" and I've seen him in concert 10 times. And this is most definitely the most disappointing JHall experience I have ever come across. First of all, these sessions with Buddy Collette only feature JHall as a sideman(although it's always great to hear his comping) and secondly, Collette's 4 flute arrangements of movie themes and the arrangements of the Porgy & Bess repertoire are quite banal and at times painful to listen to (it pains me to say this about Eric Dolphy's mentor). The only thing that saves this cd is the 4 tracks by the Chico Hamilton group. The only reason that I won't sell this cd used is that I want to have a complete collection of Hall's recordings..."
2,Not for beginners,I bought this book to help review before tests i found that it misses a lot of important information. i'm looking for something better
4,Review of Finepix A350 Digital Camera,"While we have only had the camera for a month, and have taken only about 60 photos, we are very satisfied with the camera. We are happy that we now have a small camera that you can take to any function by clipping on your belt, putting in your purse, or in my fly fishing chest pack--just in case... We have taken most photos on 3 MP, and find that they look excellent on 4 x 6 format. Haven't done any enlargements yet. We have another Finepix camera we use when we plan to get 8 x 10s or larger, anyway. Sticking with the same brand makes it easier to learn how to use the camera, as the logic is similar. We like that it uses AA batteries. Based on our past experience with rechargeables (negative), we just use off the shelf throw-away (oops, recyclable) AA alkaline batteries. Since they can be obtained cheaply and the charge does not diminish when you take them on a trip."
1,"Slow, bad focus, and jumpy vid","I was super-excited to get this camera, and very disappointed with it once I did. The pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object. Additionally, it's so slow at taking them that ANY movement (eyes blinking, etc) looks like a massive blur. And the video skips all the time. It just misses entire parts. I would highly recommend NOT getting this camera.Edit: 3 months later the lens motor ground to an irreparable jam trying to open. Excellent. Now I can finally throw this piece of junk out and buy a real camera."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I thought I would purchase an inexpensive 5MP camera from a ""camera"" (or at least film) company passing up the more expensive Canon line. I have taken close to 100 pictures and I am very disappointed. 1) Autofocus stinks - too many blurry pictures (heartbreaking); 2) Image in LCD too dark at night - you need to use the view finder or take picture ""blind""; 3) Eats batteries - 2-AAs won't even last a day; 4) Menu difficult to navigate; 5) Slider selector on the back easily gets pushed into movie mode; 6) Flash stinks - you need to be on top of whatever object/subject you are taking a picture of; everything else is dark or black. Overall, I wish I can return it, but I already cut out the UPC symbol for my rebate."
2,Intermediary product,"I bought this camera as my first camera, looking for something not too expensive with 5 megapixels and a 3x zoom.The quality of the picture is good for a computer use but I haven't try to print or enlarge them.The camera has some small troubles.* The screen has not a very good quality and stay blocked some times on the last picture* Once the camera stay blocked ""open"". I fix this by removing the battery and put them back, then I was able to turn it off.* The camera don't deal very well if you take pictures of a dark place from a sunny place or opposite. You get some over-exposition or under exposition. I wasn't having this problem with a Canon I used from a friend during a trip.My conclusion:* It's a cheap one for a cheap use. You don't really worry about and get nice picture (I use these pictures for a web site and it works great)* If you can, add 50-100$ for the same kind of camera but known to work well."
2,"Cons: Cheap Feel, Poor LCD!","I received this as a Christmas gift today and was not pleased. It's way too tiny and flimsy for my taste and has a very female look and character to it. I gave it to my sister who agreed it wasn't a very masculine-looking camera. However, she claims it's the perfect size for her purse, lol. All the pictures I took with it came out either DARK or BLURRED. You really have to play around with it to achieve clear, bright pictures and I don't have the patience for it. Also the LCD screen easily scratches - again cheap. I've dealt with many digital cameras in the past and while I could have settled for this one, I'd much rather get something I feel confident about its quality of pics, features and appearance. The camera is perfect for the young teen crowd with little experience with a digital camera. All others be forewarned!!!"
2,Fujifilm Finepix A350 review,"Bought this camera several years ago. It is OK for shots of the grand kids playing in the front yard but when you try and take a picture for an eBay auction, the camera is USELESS. It has ZERO macro picture capability... in other words, it won't focus for a close up and the viewfinder is so small you can't tell until you have created another blur-image. It just won't focus close up (under 2 feet) very well. Trying to get fine detail on smaller objects is impossible. I am buying another camera for close up pics. The menus are not very intuitive so make sure you keep the owner's manual which is also available online at the manufacturer website for download."
1,Experiencing mechanical difficulties,"For 8 months, this camera did what it was supposed to. Then the lens would not open. Sent back to Fuji under warranty and 6 weeks later, it was fixed. No issues for another 8 months, then sometimes the lens opens and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it will come into focus and sometimes it won't. This = missed photos or some blurry shots.It was decent while it lasted, just bought a Canon."
4,Simple and easy to use-great photos,"This camera is great, easy to use with clear results. We replaced a cheap digital camera that was not near as nice as this one. We are not professional photographers but wanted a good quality, easy to use camera for family photos and work needs as well. We love it. Its not one of those extraordinary cameras with all the doodads but if you are looking for straight forward, clear pictures, its great."
1,Cheap headpiece/ white cross,"Def. not satisfied. I specifically bought this costume because of the red cross, hence my daughter is doing a history fair in school, she would be impersonating Clara Barton the founder of the American Red Cross. Therefore the red cross is higly important. The costume that I recieved, the red cross was only outlined in red, basically a white cross. The head piece has a cheap transparent fabric, completly different from the rest of the costume. It is also glued with a yellow/brown glue, therfore making the headpiece have a dirty look to it."
2,barking up the wrong tree,"The criticisms in the existing reviews are well founded, but so far one key, major fault has not been mentioned: Searle remains caught between the untenable standard options for dealing with the Cartesian mind-body duality. Therefore, regardless of how he squirms, his is an untenable, ultimately incoherent position.He mis-states, and then rejects -- quite stupidly, I believe -- the one viable though not face-credible alternative to Cartesian dualism or the many varieties of its reductionism: panpsychism. On pp. 104-105, he presents a silly, grossly inadequate and distorted version (thermostats are conscious), ridicules it, and then dismisses panpsychism altogether on that basis. Interested readers should go toPanpsychism in the West (Bradford Books)for a contemporary, compelling presentation of that unpopular position."
3,Not awesome,"I read the other reviews and greased the heck out of this thing, but my cupcakes still stuck. So it was pretty disapointing, unless you have a lot of free time and extra batter to make replacement cupcakes pass on this item."
1,My muffins stuck!,"I was not successful as the muffins stuck, I did not have spray but hoped the silicon would be sufficient. I will try again with the middle name starr."
4,Sony battery charger,"This item is an ideal accessory for those of you who have a sony digital camera or camcorder. It frees up the camera, so that you can take pictures while your second battery is charging."
5,"The ONLY Soft Toy our ""Piranha Puppy"" Can't Destroy!","These toys are literally the ONLY soft toy we can leave on the floor all the time: our pup, who tore a hole in a K9 Ballistics bed within 1.5 hours, destroys everything else but Nylabones, even the hard rubber stuff! But he loves these (we also haveTuffy's Junior Bone Dog Toy, Yellow Bones,Tuffy's Junior Square Ball Dog Toy, Pink Leopard, andTuffy's Junior Ring Dog Toy, Yellow Bones) and will even play with them on his own. It takes about 4-8 months for him to rip open a seam, and then we can usually sew it up and he can resume play again. I cannot recommend these enough!!!"
2,Below expectations,"If you used books by Lynda, you're expectations are usually high. This book is easy to use but at the expense of depth. To be honest, I could not go past lesson 5. The use of a poorely animated monkey turned me off. I could not imagine myself exposing this book to my students. After effects students are usually demanding. Most of them have been through Photoshop, premiere classes, etc. They expect a book that teaches them Hollywood style effects. I had to use the AE books by Meyer. They meet student expectations."
4,Lion of a Book,"This is a collection of African folk tales from one of my very beloved authors. I could not, however, give it the highest ratings that I generally give to his other Number One Ladies Detective Agency series.This fact is no fault of the author's at all, but due to the fact that some of the stories, I felt, were meaningless. There was no punch, no moral, no learning point in many of them, though, overall I enjoyed hearing them on audiotape.I hold great respect, generally, for fables, which many of them are, but would recommend Aesop's collection any day, if one is to have a true valid learning experience. Nevertheless, this is a brave collection of stories, salvaged from an oral tradition to be preserved forever in its written form. Thankyou, Sir!"
2,For folktale lovers only,"I love ""The number one detective agency"" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales. Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting. Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fables"
4,Loved This Album,I have several CDs in the Solitudes collection by Dan Gibson. This CD did not disappoint. It arrived in good shape and on time. I have enjoyed it very much.
1,Annoying bird,"As I lay down to have a massage and waited for some lovely music and nature to wash over me..... along with the music came an annoying bird sound on the disc..... the massuese and I laughed and immediately turned it off, so I don't know how long it lasted, all I can say is that the first track is a doozey...."
4,Seems ok for light duty drills,"I had the plesure of over hearing a gal on a job site say these where good for high BPM (blows per minute) hammer drills (I'e light duty and cordless ones). So I asked her if I could try one out in my cordless drill on a waste brick, worked great!!! I was fully satisfied that bits this big (I think I used the "") with that kind of point would drill like the smaller tri-point ones. Now don't misinterpret, it didn't zoom though that brick, but did better than all I've tried yet with that style point. Also they are pretty true from what I could tell, vary little warping and wobble.I don't know how long they would last or what would happen if you started re-sharpening them but they seem to be perfect for light duty drills."
4,scarred and chipped but still working,"Bought these to punch through about 5"" of hard concrete. Used the 3/8"" bit and though 30+ holes it still works great, but the carbide tip is pretty busted up. Not sure what the expected life of these is, but I suspect I'd need a new 3/8"" if I was doing anything more delicate than bludgeoning my way through concrete."
4,"Made in China now, when the picture shows the Germany made","I am a Bosch fan. I own a few Bosch tools and am very happy with them. Very few of them are made in Germany now. I have not tried the bits yet, so my review is not about quality of the bits but lack of the information. China today is the biggest producer of many goods for most of the countries today. It does not mean the quality suffers, but who knows, maybe it does... So I try to buy things Germany made, Japan made, or USA made when they are available. That is why four stars!"
1,refurbished drill bits?,"The seal on the package for the drills was broken. Whatever lubricants were inside to keep the edges sharp had leaked out or evaporated. It also meant that I had to oil/lubricate them and put them in a new seal able container to keep them in.The bits themselves were in good condition. If you have an immediate application for these bits, you probably want to buy them somewhere else. It took more than a month for Amazon to ship them.The other sellers of this set are lower price and ship faster so they should be considered after adding in shipping.Couldn't decide what to call this item. Reconditioned implies they've been used, which they didn't appear to be, refurbished may be too positive since they didn't reseal the package."
1,Save Your Money,"Having already been a user of Weblogic 7.0, I was looking to move to 8.0 and wanted a ref that would just give me the high points of the differences between the two versions. This book fails miserably. It is inconsistant, unclear, out of date, full of coding errors, screen shot errors, and is just a bad investement. The only ""dummy"" this book is for is the author and any sucker that gets tricked into buying it.Don't waste your time with this book. You'd do better to go to the BEA website and read the on-line docs for Weblogic Server 8.0."
1,Do not BUY this book,"If you are new to Weblogic, do not get into trouble by buying this book as no code works at all. If you buy I can promise you that you will NOT reach to chapter 4.I need the authors address to send my copy back for refund.Good luck !"
2,Thin on plot--Heavy on coincidence,"This is a silly story, in which the plot is created by impractical chance coincidences. All the other reviews delve into the characters of Chastity and Reed, but I would sum them up as the ditz and the want-to-be savior. I have read so many historical romances over the last 12 years, and I can't figure out why anyone would stay up all night to read this book. The story somehow manages to be dragged out despite the convenient coincidences that cause the plot to move along. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes a rich story with depth to their characters. The kids were perhaps the most interesting part of the whole book."
3,"Good, but not as good as Books 1 and 4","I read all of these and not in order. I enjoyed them all, some more than others. This author has a great talent to writing romance scenes."
3,Unmistakeable Rogue,"Found this book really easy, interesting reading.If you enjoy historical romance you will enjoy readingthis and other Annette Blair books."
4,Enjoyed it,"Other reviewers are far more eloquent than am I, but I read the book and enjoyed it and felt my enjoyment was worth leaving a positive remark for an excellent writer. Thank you for sharing the story of Reed and Chastity."
3,I really enjoy mine...,"My daughter gave me mine for christmas in 02 & I have to say I really love it !! I haven't noticed the water getting colder but will check it out when I use it tonight. I'm looking at it for a friend that just had surgery on her shoulder area & think it will help her as it has helped me with my back pain.I agree, they really need to do something about the noise level, and I'm not crazy about the way the hose sometimes will slip out of the mat. Other than that I have no complaints, it works great & not only is it relaxing , it also helps with fibromyalgia & chronic back pain."
3,A little cool...,"Although I was really impressed at how powerful this spa was and how easy it was to set up, I was disappointed at how fast it cooled down the bath water. The engine blows cool air into the mat and it can get pretty chilly. I anticipate using this more in the summer for that reason."
5,Great Price for Replacement Battery,"This is a great replacement battery for my Panasonic KxTg5100 cordless phones. I ordered three, the price was great, and hopefully they will last quite a while. Will update in the coming months as to longevity."
3,not GE,"Item received is not GE as in picture; works ok, but needs to recharge more often than the old batteries i had."
2,Phone Battery,"Since it's a battery, I can not rate the life, charging characteristics or quality. However, when the ad says ""GE BATTERY"", I expected a GE battery, not a Chinese substitute. I will not buy from this seller again."
4,phone battery value,"This is the third replacement battery for the phone. They have all been purchased on-line at very reasonable prices. The first two held up very well, better than the predicted average life of about 6 months. I expect this one to do as well. I saw the same exact battery in a store yesterday for twice the price that I paid (including shipping). Thank you for being there when I needed you.Joe"
1,Obvious Quote Mining,"This book won't appeal to anybody, except those who want it to be true. It is obvious quote mining. (Check out Talk Origins for a discussion on how quote mining is used, especially in this book) If you need to lie in order to believe something, it is not much of a belief, in my opinion."
5,turkish music,"I lived in Turkey for 4 years, and thought this CD to really capture the bellydancing music from that part of the world."
1,these sleeves are too big,These sleeves were bigger than what I expected no use for them for yugioh cards were Wichita I got them for.
2,"Fire, Nazis, Wagner . . . I was just glad when it was over","This is the second novel I've read by Masterton in which the main action consists of people being burned alive, with graphic descriptions. (The other:Fire Spirit.) I hope there are no more like this, but, if I come across another, I'm skipping it.This one involves an ancient ritual through which people can burn themselves alive and become immortal. It involves some gobbledygook about the composer Wagner, Nazis, and some Native Americans get in there, too.I warn people that Masterton's novels usually contain gore and sex. (As for the latter, there's a nasty and buxom lady in leather with burning abilities and a taste for humiliation.) This is not the only Masterton novel I've disliked. But this is one of two that I thought was not even entertaining (the other:The Ninth Nightmare (Night Warriors), which I stopped reading halfway through)."
5,Spartacus VENGEANCE is solid,"While Liam McIntyre is no Andy Whitfield, the diminished star power in the title role allows the other performers to shine. Lucy Lawless is flawless as a broken but ruthlessly focused Lucretia; Manu Bennett, the brooding and wounded Crixus, is, as always, compelling; but the special treat of VENGEANCE is Dustin Clare's super-stud portrayal of Gannicus. In the end though what really makes this season stand out are the villains: Nick Tarabay's Ashur; Viva Bianca's Ilithyia; and last but not least, Craig Parker's Gaius Claudius Glaber."
2,No Heart,This show was awesome in the very first season. Unfortunately the lead died and the replacement guy just does not have the same heart and soul. I was disappointing in this season overall but will not stop watching. If you are squeamish about graphic blood and violence or full male and female nudity and graphic sex I would also avoid this show because it has it all.
2,Different feeling,"I'm a fan of Spartacus, but this season makes it different than the previous ones. It seems unattractive and not heavy enough... I think it is NOT fully emotional touchy like before."
3,Less talking would be nice.,"They talk too much in this season. The same reason people don't like to read Shakespeare is the reason people won't like this season. Too much character development, too much whining, too much drama. More swordplay, less wordplay."
3,Decent follow-up,"Not quite as exciting as the first two seasons, but not bad. The characters are not quite as like-able to me, and I'm not sure if it's the over-dramatic acting or the direction. I might keep watching next season, but not until it came out for free."
5,great,"lots of sex lots of blood and violence, this season just like previous one really really good, Liam Mclntyre did a good job."
5,GREAT!,"I could not stop watching episode after episode. Thought I would be disappointed with the new Spartacus but he is great. It seems that Spartacus and his unfortunate followers (some of them) narrowly escape death every episode. I keep saying to myself ""how's he going to get out of this one""."
3,lots of blood and gore and sex,"be prepared for an amazingamount of gore and blood and sex its low key B Cable version porn plain and simple with a brief storyline, lots of nudity lots and lots of gore and lots of very frontal nudity .did i like it not so much..if i want to watch adult films then i will rent adult films..season one was far more engaging and season two frankly left me cold .i just couldn't get into this series and frankly wading through the blood and gore and sex left me frustrated and tired waiting for the story line to develop sadly it never did for me.I am no prude nor am i opposed to nudity or open sexuality in films but this wasn't what i expected .I tried to like it , and i purchased three episodes and after the third i just couldn't go any further .i gave it three stars for a very good try."
3,Not as good as season 1,"As a woman, I'm just not loving this guy as Spartacus. The season is good, but I miss the old characters. ""Eh"" is about all I can say."
1,Spartacus is awful,There was too much killing and gore with no plot or suspense. The acting was terrible as well. Wish we hadn't ordered it.
1,Don't buy this with the Bosch Bosch PS130-2A drill !!,I bought this masonry drill set because it was the recommended Amazon bundle with the Bosch PS130-2A electric drill that I purchased simultaneously. However the drill bits are very long and wiggle around creating much bigger holes than needed. Also they have special indentations (SCS system?) which doesn't fit the electric drill chuck. Get shorter drill bits with either non indented ends (best) or else 3 or 6 sides so that they match the 3 protrusions inside the electric drill's chuck.
1,number one,I am sure that the book was very accurate and well written- but I never went beyond the second page.NLRB that is the apriori! How different from the British political apriori of bringing in the opposition-not intoKindle US Power Adapter (Not included with Kindle or Kindle Touch)the economic competition of funding political candidates but into Parliament.
4,Forget the politics -- this is great writing,"Never mind that Geohogan was dead wrong about the future of organized labor or that his pre-Clinton paleoliberalism is dated and painfully overwrought or even that he would have deep and abiding personal contempt for a conservative like me. This guy can flat-out write like a dream.Without a doubt, every anecdote in this book is exaggerated and twisted for rhetorical effect. But what a memoir it is, alternately melancholy and funny, by a great storyteller who has the self-awareness to mock his own martyr complex.A classic of style over substance."
5,Dynamite book,"I recently picked this up again. Both a great sketch of labor history and especially labor in the 80's, and also a kind of coming of age story of a man struggling with his idealism. For all that, it's absolutely fun to read - the tone is sharp and fast, and the author never takes himself too seriously. Reminds me of another favorite on a different topic, Cadillac Desert by Marc Reisner."
3,Nice,"Even if I, as a German, have problems to really value German bands,this group is acceptable. I just want to say... Simple lyrics?Who gives a damn. English pop lyrics are always simple, it is actually hard to write good German lyrics that are simple and catchy. I only want pledge out my veto that this sounds like Avril Lavigne or No Doubt on German, DEFINITELY NOT... the guitar work is way better, and the whole sound of the vocalist, is a lot deeper and more indie than Avril Lavigne... first of all German bands cannot be compared to any native bands, because mostly the affection the words is missing, as well as the whole passion.But this group manages somehow to make an acceptable bridge.SO IF YOU NEED(!) to really listen a German band (shame on you enough): check this out. The lyrics are neat and not simple or what.""Geile Zeit"" is one of the best German songs since Herbert Grönemeyer."
3,Good music transends language,"It has a couple of really good tracks. The tracks have a pop rock feel to them and her voice is nice. Even though I can't understand what she is saying, I enjoyed it.I could help but notice that Tranenschwer (track 5) reminded me of the song Autobiography."
5,Wonderful!,"Our Border Collie gets ""hot spots"" every year, on his hip, and I usually spray them with anti-itch spray for poison ivy but he still usually scratches and chews his hair off and his skin raw! So I have to put a patch over it. But I happened to see this spray at T.J. Max and bought it and it works wonderfully!! I didn't have to put a patch on his spot and within 2 squirts (over 2 days) he was no longer bothered by it!! It started healing right away then and the hair was able to grow back! It was a fantastic ""investment""!"
2,A Book About Lisa Maria,"This book is about Lisa Maria. Lisa Maria has had to move home to live with her parents, because Lisa Maria is having some problems. Lisa Maria might just find a guy to fall in love with, though, which would be good, because Lisa Maria wants to be in a relationship.You'd better really like the name Lisa Maria, because it is repeated ad nauseum, even in places where a perfectly good pronoun would do. Thus far, I haven't been able to make it past Chapter Two, because the constant statements of Lisa Maria's name have driven me nuts. I give it two stars because there might be some good stuff later in the book. Maybe you'll be able to find it."
4,Awesome Hardcore Mountainbiking,This video shows some excellent footage of death defying mountain biking feats. You will be amazed at the stunts performed on the man-made jungle gym of a mountain bike course in British Columbia. This is definitely some of the best extreme mountain biking I have seen in a long time.
4,good product,"Products from Kimberly Sayer smell wonderful, are reasoanbly priced. Cleanser leaves skin soft, however lotion is not quite enough moisture for me, I have dry skin that tends towards rosacea. It is also winter so skin tends to be dryer. Organic is a great benefit."
5,Ah Memories...,"As a Freshman in college in '99, one of my roommates had this CD. We often had it playing as we all relaxed and studied, or were drifting off to sleep. It was so calming and so relaxing, and it was always something I remembered and wanted to find. Especially for the last track, Moonlight Sonata. I finally thought to look on Amazon, found it for much less than I was willing to pay, and I now look forward to purchasing more titles in the ""By the Sea"" series. It's every bit as wonderful and relaxing as I recalled. I'm going to be married soon, and this will certainly be packed along for the honeymoon and taken out for romantic nights in front of the fireplace."
5,Great quality and finish,I snapped the end link on the 22mm rear sway bar on my 1999 Civic. I know this product states it doesnt fit that car but I needed one where the threaded ends were 90 degrees off set. It fit perfectly and solved my issue.I would definitely recommend.
1,A music listener from MD.,"I think this album is WAY overated. A friend of mine who had the cd gave it to me and I thought it was extremely boring. To me, it lacked intensity, soul, and expression. I have heard David Bach perform in a ""live"" setting......He needs to come out of his shell a little bit more. I'm a musician of 27 years and I just couldn't ""feel"" the soul or passion."
4,preachy but good,"The Saddle Club is off to Moose Hill Riding Camp, where they expect to have fun and learn a lot. But the other camps are mostly snobs who consider any chore but riding the horse beneath them. It takes a stable fire to drive home the meaning of cooperation and setting aside differences in order to work for the greater good."
5,WONDERFUL!,"This book was great. It was about horses, friends, and it was exciting. Stevie, Lisa and Carole love the riding camp but hate the other people there. Except Phil, a boy who Stevie likes. Days later, however, a life-threatening occurence puts all rider's skills to the test."
3,snotty,"this book was good, but a lot of people were snotty. It was funny. I recommend reading schooling horse(saddle club book). That's a good book. I like most of this authors books."
4,phone battery review --yes but,"The batteries were fine, but the amount of the shipping charge for something so small and weighing so little was ridiculous. I doubt that we will use that company again."
4,shop smart,phone battery was as stated and arrived in time frame identified. Was easier to find this on the net instead of driving all over town.
1,Worst batteries ever!,I ordered five batteries as replacements for the original phone batteries that were over 5 years old. The batteries I received last under 20 minutes of talk time. They are useless. Don't waste your money on these.
1,NOT GE TL26402 Batteries,"This battery arrived, and was NOT a TL26402 by GE as Advertised. It was a DUOGREEN BATEDU103 replacement for Uniden BT-446, BT-1005 which fits in the same space, though it is about 15% smaller.The battery performance is fine.I cannot tolerate advertising one thing and shipping another. I might buy the same batteries again. I won't buy them or anything else from the same vendor. This is the kind of thing that will cause people to stop trusting a store or website."
2,wooden style spoils the book,The author's fascinating subject--brave deeds in an exotic land--succumbs entirely to his inability to make the subject come alive. The book is primarily of interest because of its bibliography
1,Sophomoric,"Here's a book pretending to be a history while written like a young boy's adventure. The only ""research"" seems to come from the prejudiced memoirs of ""solders"" bemoaning the loss of their stores of ""liqueurs and cigars"" while they occupied a simple people who thrashed them until they left."
2,I'm about to give up the book..,"Big bold type, short book, frequent flyer miles and be a courier and staying at people's houses overseas will save you money.Now, don't bother. Go to Encyclopedia of Cheap Travel."
4,An end to full fare travel,"This book provides useful tips and strategies that show that it is possible to travel well for less. It is a good begining for learning how to think differently. I look for deals all the time now, and also read Insider Secrets to Killer Travel Deals and Fly Free As Easy As 1-2-3. It is amazing how much more vacation fun can be done by knowing how to pay less for air and hotel arrangements."
3,FLY FREE STAY CHEAP,"I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS. I BELIEVE IT IS INFORMATIVE BUT NOT INFORMATIVE ENOUGH. IT TALKS ABOUT ""STAYING CHEAP"" BUT IT BASICALLY ONLY MENTIONS ABOUT YOUTH HOSTELS. IT TALKS ABOUT GOING ABROAD BUT NOT ENOUGH ABOUT TRAVELING IN THE U.S. I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY IT DOES NOT GO INTO ENOUGH DETAIL. WITH ONLY 57 PAGES IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. SHE PROVIDES BASIC KNOWLEDGE THE REST YOU HAVE TO DIG FOR ON YOUR OWN"
1,know what you're getting,"Just to let you know, this is not written by Jim Carroll the poet-writer of the basketball diaries. ""Cover of Darkness"" seems to be a different Jim Carroll entirely. I made the mistake of ordering this book thinking of the wrong Carroll. One star for the mix up."
2,Really?,"This is the second book I've tried to read from Jim Paul. The first, Harry and I Build a Siege Weapon, I couldn't finish because it was too self-indulgent. Same problem here.While the topic is a great idea, contrasting a medieval mental perspective with the realities of the modern world, and based on an excellent book, Passion of the Western Mind, Paul's execution falls almost entirely flat. There is far too much LA and Jim Paul and hardly any explicit medieval. What medieval contemplation is explicit is done with a not too subtle sneer. I gave up after reading three pages on the difference between two types of sunglasses Paul owns. I understood his belabored point about perspective but Mr. Paul seems far too interested in himself to take anything else seriously."
2,"Ok, but not what I expected.","The book is good, bought for my grandson, but wasn't all I expected of it. Hoped for a little more of the story."
4,Spin me a web...,"I've been reading Arthurian fantasy for years, and was fairly sick of it to be honest. The story seemed to be told in every way imaginable already.Zettel's story, however, focuses more on lesser known characters and she spins her own tale (irregardless of all the 'rules') and makes a pretty decent story.If you are an Arthurian fanatic (as I once was) and you are going to be disturbed by every bent rule or fact, pass on this book. If you'd just like to read a good story/romance based in this era, pick this one up!Risa, the heroine, is a strong willed woman who fights against society and culture and can hold her own in a fight. Gawain is a true honorable knight...imperfect, but seeking to be the best man possible.The magic of the book is more of the 'old ways', close to nature and fairly druid-like.I enjoyed the story and look forward to the next!"
3,Oddly lifeless,"In Camelot's Shadow lack's the spark of creativity and empathy that make Zettle's SF books like Fool's War such refreshing and enjoyable reads.This is not a bad book, and it's well written on a technical level, but the plot is oddly lifeless. It has all the elements a good Arthurian fantasy needs, but for some reason they don't gel.The backstory data-dumps about the villian and the glimpses we see of court life in Camelot are more compelling than the love story between the two main characters. The second half of the book is better than the first, which is very slow, but the ending comes out of thin air. Where did the heroine learn the spell she uses to save herself? The reader has no reason to believe she has that sort of knowledge."
1,It rankled,"I'll not go into the tedious details of how it is in no way historically accurate (because it isn't) and I'll also skip all the differences between it and Sir Gawain. Anyone with even a mediocre education should be able to see that it mangled one of the best Arthurian legends into a travesty.Aside from all of that, it was entirely predictalbe and full of stereotypes."
3,Too bad they don't sell just the second disc,"I bought Black having been very pleased with my Gatecrasher Wet album. However, I was very disappointed with the first disc (Early Set), being mostly monotonous house music. There were few variations in an otherwise repetitive beat. I haven't touched the disc since listening to it once. The second disc (Late Set), on the other hand, almost justified the money I paid for the album. It contained excellent trance from a variety of artists. I still prefer the Wet album. If only I could have purchased only the second disc..."
4,Always bet on black,"This is the last cd in the gatecrasher line that I needed to complete my collection. All the cd's are phat, and can turn out any party, but in terms of true trance compilation, i think you may be better off with the Red or the Wet Mixes. I will say this, I like the early stuff better than the newest, which seems to be a little more low energy and less vocal. Do yourself a favor and buy a ticket to Heathrow, then take the first train to Sheffield, and before you know it you'll be at the republic...see Gratecraher in person, don't wait to be invited."
5,Affordable and easy to install,This arrived quickly and was very easy to install. It performed as promised and I am very happy.
4,Inspirational and Illuminating Book,"Interestingly, I found this book to be inspirational. Even though the book flies in the face of religion, it does have a certain spirituality about it. For example, one of the book's messages concerns living in the ""present"". I.e. being present in our world right now and experiencing life to its fullest. The author even includes a beautiful poem by William Blake to bring the point home.I also thoroughly enjoyed the science including the explanation of programmed cell death and basic biology which was all new to me. In addition, the psychological perspective was interesting as well. Here Mr Volk does a nice job explaining ""terror management"" and the primal clash.The book really whetted my appetite for these and other topics. Luckily Volk also includes a nice bibliography for further study."
5,An Excellent Book,"This book caught my eye when I was walking down an aisle in the library, what are the odds? But I am so glad that I found it. Volk is a really great writer and his insight about death from the standpoint of a scientist makes me feel at peace. Highly recommended"
2,Nice but has a problem,"This kitchenware is OK for everyday dining but has a major problem. It comes with a rack so you can hang the silverware. The knobs on the ends of the silverware are very flimsy plastic that cracks easily. Without the knobs you can't put the silverware on the rack. I tried super-gluing the knobs back together but they just split again and again.The manufacturer needs to use heavier guage plastic and screw them on instead of pressing them on. If they did this, I would deem this a 4 star product instead of a 2 star product."
4,"No Bad, Sublime has done better","This album produce through Brad's life and some after death is a good ""On The Way to work"" CD. This CD, which is short, contains a good rythm which is good to get stuck in your head on the short commut to work. Though the songs do get a bit repetative it is fun to listen to."
3,Half good,"WAY too short. I can name four other ""Doin' Time"" remixes off the top of my head not on here. The ""Bradley Version"" on this disc is worthless -- just Brad's voice instead a 1-sec sampled voice. But the Wyclef remix rocks, and the Pharcyde's raps add to the song."
4,Excellent,"First, the play is a bonanza for the actor: each of the six actors play six different characters. The play, for lack of a better term, is a tribute (or goodbye?) to the nuclear American Family and to the ideals that forged the character of our nation for the better part of 100 years. The play fails to entirely escape tones of heavy nostalgia - I suspect that was Gurney's goal - and therefore when staged care must be given to resist making it a museum piece or worse, a love story. Gurney does not appear to seek an embrace with the past, not does he wish to completely say goodbye to it."
4,"""Stout Fella""","Not to contradict (too much), but ""Beau Sabreur"" WAS made into a movie in the early 1920s. I don't know if it survives. Also, read the trilogy in the order written and published -- otherwise the ""mystery"" in Beau Geste is too easy to solve, since Wren gives some of the answers in BS (sorry) and clears up (almost) everything in Beau Ideal. Overall, this second book of the Geste Trilogy moves a little slower than Beau Geste, and serves in large measure to set the stage for the final denoument (did I spell that right?) in Beau Ideal."
3,it's a bit cheesy and macho but fun,"This is coming from a Dictators fan. Manitoba's Wild Kingdom is a quasi Dictators reunion (Scott ""Top Ten"" Kempner"" wasn't present). Essentially this is a party metal record. Some sounds thrashy, some punky and some mid tempo. It's only 26 minutes long and the lyrics are about partying, getting laid, the negative effects of drugs, just your standard rock themes. I don't take this album out much but it brings some amusement to me and my friends when drunk. That's about all I can say about it. Did I miss something?"
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!,"The costume itself was made with poor craftsmanship. When I opened the package (3 days after receiving it in the mail) the tail was ripped in 3 different places. I did not even get a chance to try it on my son. I called the company and was told that I should have opened it right away to see if there were any problems, I was also told that they do NOT return costumes. Had I known that I would have not purchased it. I was asked if I could repair it myself and then offered a 5 dollar reimbursement for the repair work...this was 5 days ago and I have yet to see the reimbursement on my credit card.Do not buy from this company, especially for children's costumes."
5,Cute baby monkey costume!,"Costume is very cute, but beware that it looks a little bit better in the photo. Nonetheless, my daughter looked great in it. And my family had a memorable Halloween."
1,Disappointed,"I received this costume in the mail this morning and must admit that I expected more. For the price, the craftsmanship is shoddy at best and the costume looks nothing like it does in the photo. I'm disappointed and would never order from this company again."
5,"""Comfort food"" for the senses","Imagine .... a grey, rainy day, a warm cosy armchair, a cup of tea, a slice of cake and an old fashioned black and white movie on the t.v. by the master of suspense, Hitchcock. I love these old movies and they still hold up after all these years. You don't need blood and gore and graphically disturbing images to entertain. I love the actors in this and the whole nine yards. I went to see the '39 Steps' spoof on the stage in London - FANTASTIC! Lots of fun.I have been admonished for not clarifying the content of this item. The film in the Vol. 2 is only 'THE 39 STEPS'.Enjoy!"
4,Highly amusing and well-written and crafted mystery,"This book was a wonderful surprise: a well-crafted, amusing and gracefully written culinary mystery. Out of the many many culinary mysteries on the shelf these days, this stands out as the best I've read yet. The recipes and food descriptions are integral to the story, and are integrated well with the text--not stuck onto the back as a last second ""gimmick"". The mystery was interesting and engaging, and the characters sympathetic and amusing. Can't wait for the next in this series to come out!"
4,I can't help falling in love with Charly!,"The main protagonist in this novel was simply amazing, lovable, charming, I couldn't help but smile everytime I read about him. He's a very good hearted person, genuinely kind and tries his best to help his friends (and strangers even). The main antagonist is also very...charming. He's a mysterious, beautiful, and rich gentleman with a dark secret. He sort of reminds me of a vampire...so beautiful on the outside, yet so evil on the inside. The reason why this book didn't get 5 stars was because there are better books out there...tbis book was great, but it wasn't outstanding. It didn't leave me with that accomplished feeling I usually get after an amazing novel. But it is good, and worth a read."
4,VH1: Where Are They Now? comes to mind,"After a pretty much succesful branch-off from teen bubblegum machine New Edition, these guys Bell Biv DeVoe turned the tables with hip-hop flavored R&B (which is all R&B is nowadays anyway). They ripped it up with songs like ""Poison"" & ""I Thought It Was Me."" Too bad I no longer have RealAudio to listen to the samples with. But the songs are still memorable in my mind. I haven't heard all of the songs, but the ones I have heard are good. After a not-too-acclaimed N.E. reunion album in '96, thoughts that leap to mind include: VH1: Where Are They Now?"
2,average then&now,i like do me&poison but that's about it.i though the music was chessy then and even worse now.Ricky Bell had some talent but never got his stuff out.Bivins was a good talent scout(Boyz 11 Men)and what did Devoe exactly do?however there impact is all over current R-n-B&Hip Hop and that's not good.
2,Guy clone? Uh...no way...,"First of all, Ricky is the only one who can sing out of this trio, and he tries his best, mind you. Second, the album's only stand-out single, and the most successful one, was ""Poison,"" so if you're expecting more of the ""Poison"" formula on the rest of the album, you're not going to get it. Finally, these guys are looking too much like the original New Jack Swing Kings, Guy..."
5,You blew me away baby!!!,"Who would have thought that the three so called lesser Gods of N.E. would be able to deliver such a smashing album. Having great material and very good producers doesn't always amount to a great cd. Till this day haven't heard a song with pumping dance action like Poison. I still think it's a pity that these three guys didn't use the same producers for ""Hootie Mack"", they were missing the magic from the first album. But ballads like ""When will I see you smile again?"" and ""I do need You"" bring back memories of great moments of romance. This album still is no. 2 in my top 10 cd's. My no. 1 album always will be ""Heartbreak"" because of the great synergy in the material and voices."
3,Instant party.,"It's funny that the pop music I despised ten years ago I somehow enjoy today. Sure it may be everything we laugh at early 90's pop culture for, what with their high-top fades (Am I getting the terminology correct?), ridiculous clothes, and mildly misogynistic lyrics, but Bell Biv Devoe's ""Poison"" is a guilty pleasure of mine. If you find a big group of people In your house, hit play: instant party.But I think I may also mention that the beats on a lot of these songs still stand up when removed from their early 90's pop context. Surprisingly, the songs are accompanied by tracks that would usually be considered too heavy and chaotic in such a lightweight hip-hop setting. Hey, no wonder, it's Hank and Keith Shocklee and Eric ""Vietnam"" Sadler, whom you might remember as the producers for Public Enemy in what was considered their ""classic"" period, producing about half of the songs on this album.The world works in bizarre ways, my friends."
3,good music but wrong music,To whom it may concern I haven't listened to BBD in years but when I finally got a chance to listen to it only thing that came out was jazz music it would be nice if you could fix this problem. I would really like to come back on line and here BBD. The right cd. thank you.
4,Great!!! B.B.D.-Betta' Believe Dat!!!!!!,Must have for any New Edition fan. This is a branch off of that tree.
2,"Great Musicians, Good Music but No Inspiration!","I think that the kind of experience which involves mix of classical music and jazz approach is a most delicate and dangerous one.Lalo Schifrin and his longtime collaboration with the London Symphony did not convince me to listen to it more than some few times.Great musicians, master performance, good arrangements but ... something's missing!The best Lalo Schifrin you can get is on his Jazz albums and soundtracks. Don't lose them."
1,sunprocp7906mini,the face is smaller than described I want to return it for a bigger one but keep getting rejected by your mail no tele # to talk to someone about the problem
2,Disappointed,i chose this tach mainly for it's size and the fine history of Sunpro. I needed a small tach because I planned on installing it on the steering column of my 1970 Mach 1 Mustang and I needed it small enough not to occlude the vison of the speedo and dash gauges. It installed nicely but the tach does not read out accurately and it hangs intermittantly at 4000 rpm sometimes and then falls back when the moter is shut off. I really don't know what the rpm of the engine is as it seem to read about 200-300 rpm lower than the actual rpm.
4,Nice little tach,"Good tach, air core makes the movement as smooth as high end tachs. However, this same tach can be bought at your local autozone for $35 and you don't have to pay shipping."
4,Good product. Nicely designed. Easy to install.,"I bought this tach for my sons 97 civic DX (it didn't come with a tacho). Started looking out on ebay and these little babies were selling for about 35 bucks - so Amazon was a steal at 25 bucks with free shipping.Shipping: It arrived about 4 days later (kudo's to Amazon for super fast free shipping). Package was good - nothing damaged.First look: Opened the package and took it out. Came with the tach, instruction manual, and vehicle reference. Nothing complicated.Installation: This was a breeze. Went online to civic forums and they said the blue wire that my car already came with was the tach wire. Installation was so easy, took about 20 mins, I thought I did somethign wrong. I started the car up and the tach came to life. Have it mounted on the pillar to the left of the driver.Longevity: Been installed for at least a month now and no problems. Works great."
2,Absolutely disappointing,"In the modern age of publishing, there can be no excuses for sub-standard figures. Why is it then, that this book has technical illustrations that are both crude and clumsy? I was unable to find a single figure without at least one error.The content was also extremely disappointing, being of a primarily superficial level. Ok for introduction to the topics, but no more. I was also a little disturbed with some of the referencing methods used by the author, where it appeared in one instance, that they essentially repeated portions of a referenced publication.I strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere unless you are simply interested in learning about the basics."
5,Great compact unit with exceptional sound clarity,Just got one of these and it is great! Like all Sony products - READ THE MANUAL -to fully understand and enable its many features.
1,NAsty,"I've used the volcano organic lemon juice previously and really enjoyed itTHis item, on the other hand tastes awful. It has a chemical taste to it. According to Amazon, it can't be returned, so it's going in the trash"
3,No way would I try the tennoning jig in this book,"This book is good in the descriptions about wood selection and wood types. It has a wide variety of woodworking techniques and operations. However, the overall techniques used range from good, to absurd, to dangerous. The problem is, a beginner may not be able to know the difference between a good technique and a dangerous or poor technique. Also, some of the projects are good, and some are poor. The main problem with this book is lack of consistency. The positive is that there is good stuff in it and a wide breadth of subject matter."
5,This is a MUST HAVE book for the Novice,"I have purchased or checked out from the Library probably 30 books on woodworking in the last 6 months. This one I'd rate as the Very Best, of the none specialized books on woodworking. You simply must get this book, especially if you are just getting started into woodworking. As far as I am concerned, this book is a bargain."
3,Complete for the Beginner,"Other reviewers have pointed out the flaws of this book and I will concur: not enough drawings, inaccurate parts lists, over simplified projects..ect...However, this is not a bad book if you are a beginner, and like another reviewer said have a good selection of power tools. For somebody who is not a novice you may find 3 or 4 projects that will challenge you. There are much better books, such as Christopher Schwarz's Workbenches, which will teach you techniques such as mortise and tenon, drawboring, hand planing, and the all important task of making a proper workbench. A more accomplished woodworker will begin to design his or her projects after learning the basics of joinery and wood selection. This book will be better suited to a beginning woodworker or a person who may be interested in starting the hobby.."
2,same old plans,"Well i got the book opened it up and saw that almost every project is whats in the Handyman club books they published several years ago, so if you have these books don't waste your money on this one and if your any sort of woodworker the projects are way to easy. If your just starting then go for it unless you have the handyman series like I do."
1,Never Received Book!!,I never received this book. I have emailed Amazon and seller. No response. It has been over a month!!!!!!
4,Not bad,"I bought these mostly for the 1/4"" and have used one of the two 6"" and one of the two inch about 50 times apiece and they still work. Much better than buying cheap bits."
4,quality product,on time high quality set we used several type of drill but this set seems to be one of the best
2,Hammer drill assessment,I guess I should have looked closer at what I was getting for 30 some dollars....seemed like a great price for the bits I saw in the store....but these are short ones...fine for certain jobs but if I have to reach into a small space with these bits and the big hammer drill behind it I'm out of luck
2,Amazon bundled this item with the hammer drill I also purchased,When purchasing the Bosch 1194AVSRK hammer drill it these bits were recommended via Amazon. Since I needed to drill a hole in my brick house for a basement bathroom vent I thought I would order them too. They are the incorrect type for the drill. Beware of Amazon. I now have a set of bits that are SDS and am waiting for my new order or bits which are on back order. Do not trust the selections that Amazon makes but the Drill is great.
4,very good resource,"This is an engaging read for students who want to grapple with a lot ofthe details of Darwinism that tend to get left out of more fluffypopularizations of evolution. For example a good chapter reviewingthe basic (but rarely reviewed) facts supporting the theory--in particular the subtle difference between early hominids' andhomo sapiens' abililty to develop articulate speech. Particularlyexcellent, though, is the last chapter dealing with the rhetorical(but scientifically empty) attacks on Darwinism made by someconservatives."
3,healing with nutritution,long on facts short on results. It just was not what I was looking for. May make a good ref book for future information. He references a lot of researchers.
2,A must for Norris fans.,"The fight in front of the neon sign is the best and most famous part of this otherwise less-than-mediocre movie. Norris' lack of acting skill really shines, but then that's not why you watch a Chuck Norris movie is it? It's worth watching some night on cable if only for the aforementioned neon sign fight and the ""I'm gonna break your face!"" scene."
3,A routine revenge thriller.,"Chuck Norris is a debt collector for a small, yet profitable Hong Kong gambling house. When his employer (and good friend) is assasinated by gang muscle, he goes on the war path, kicking in the teeth of all who get in his way as he hunts down those responsible.Forced Vengeance is a standard issue action/revenge thriller. Director James Fargo (The Enforcer, 1976) shows very little growth as a director, although I'll grant that the neon backlit fight scene is an attempt at style that almost works. Action star Norris was a film or two away from becoming truly comfortable in front of the camera, so his performance is pretty stiff, but he remains a likable presence. The movie appears to be shot in the widescreen (2:35:1 ratio), so a letterboxed DVD edition would be a nice gift for Norris buffs such as myself. Anyone at MGM/UA listening?"
4,"Great movie, but not Chuck's best.","The action is pretty good and the story moves along nicely (except the five years it seems to take to go from the docks to his boat when he first returns) but the acting done by some of the actors was a bit stiff. The two cops for example were rather one dimensional, and don't get me started on the big boy working for Osiris. Worth the money but not nearly as good as say Code of Silence or An Eye For An Eye. And definitely nowhere near Hero and The Terror."
2,Only for Norris fans.,"I enjoy Chuck Norris movies, and Forced Vengeance was very enjoyable, but I would not recommend it for none Norris fans. The fights are good and exciting, but the whole film itself is forgettable. Highly recommended for fans of the Norris films The Octogon, Force Of One, and An Eye For An Eye."
2,Not One of Norris' Best Efforts,"Forced Vengeance is not one of Chuck Norris' better films. Norris' film career has been predicated on giving people what they want, and the way that they want it. But in this film, the plot gets convoluted, and the action is not good enough to make up for that shortcoming.Norris plays the bouncer at a casino in Hong Kong. The owner, who has become like a father to Norris, is murdered by a syndicate trying to take it over. Norris goes out for revenge, and becomes emeshed in a vast conspiracy and lots of bloodshed. It gets hard keeping up with who's doing what, to whom, and even why, and after a while, you don't care. Which would be okay if that action was so spectacular that it made you forget about the plot deficiencies. But it's not.Norris has made a number of very entertaining movies. But Forced Vengeance is not one of them."
4,Marshmallow Surprise!,"FORCED VENGEANCE is one of Chuck's early 80s missing classics. Chuck Norris plays Josh, the bouncer and strong arm guy for, of all things, an honest Jewish-American casino owner in British Hong Kong (played by David Opatoshu).When the honest businessman stands up to a Chinese-British syndicate trying to beat him down, he's killed along with almost everyone in his family except his pretty jet-setting daughter whom Chuck is trying to protect.Chuck is young here. There's lots of excellent martial arts action and some outrageous plot twists, and Chinese people speaking Yiddish, so this is a must-see despite the relatively chintzy production values and Norris' more-than-usually stiff acting."
3,Great Show ... Crappy DVD Coverart,"I speak on behalf of ALL graphic designers out there - this has got to be THE WORSE coverart ever! This applies for Part II as well. Did they not take any promotional shots that could have been used for the front cover?!? When I buy a DVD of a film/television show that I have enjoyed I expect to get the whole package: eye-catching coverart, clever packaging (if called for) and an impressive interactive menu ... NOT something that looks like it has been put together in less than an hour! Why they have treated the DVD release of 'Commander In Chief' in such a tacky and lacklustre way is beyond me. It would've been nice to have seen a better appreciation of the promising but short-lived series. Very frustrating and disappointing!"
3,It is English-subtitled and closed-captioned for the hearing-impaired,The PART 1 packaging does not say whether it was closed-captioned or English-subtitled. It has BOTH. The main menu has SET UP in which you go in to turn on the captioning/subtitling.The Amazon information for PART 2 of this show does have info that it's captioned.The English subtitles and closed-captioning are very clear to read. The image quality is good. Barebones is right--there are no extras--just the 10 episodes on two discs.[...]
5,Why they yanked this show?,"It's unheard of. Geena Davis got GOLDEN GLOBE for her part.So why only 1 season?Is it because Hila Clintn and her husband, Willard?"
2,Ripoff,"The show was good, but splitting 18 episodes (less than a normal season's worth) into two separate DVD sets is just a lame attempt to squeeze extra bucks out of us. I'm not buying. They should fire the marketing hack who split this set."
5,sooo glad I found this set!,I was reading the USA magazine in my Sunday paper. A person wrote in to ask what happened to the series. So I went online and voila!
5,The best Mountain Biking Video Avalible,"Kranked 2 is a non stop freeride,downhill and jumping video with awesome riders like John Jesme, Brian Lopes and many more, doing sick tricks , 360s ,no footers , back flips , table tops etc.The music is done by Fatboy Slim , Phunk Junkeez and a whole lot more. There are also lots of death drops ,""stair jumping"", slalom , (Palmer vs. Lopes at the slalom championships + freeride slalom),and trail riding.SEE THIS VIDEO!"
4,"Great sound, nice companion to Screaming Blue Murder","This new John Sykes album is a welcome addition to his live catalogue. Features same rhythm section from his Thin Lizzy live album but adding Derek Sherinian on keyboards (and minus Scott Gorham, of course). The concert is well-recorded although I would have liked a little bigger lead guitar sound. One annoyance is that the album has been mixed to fade out the audience response after each track. As such, it doesn't feel like a continuous show. I was a little disappointed in the album not including any tracks from Nuclear Cowboy, but other solo material such as ""Look In My Eyes"" and ""I Don't Want To Live My Life"" come across very well next to Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy classics. In the end, one should review the content that is on the record rather than that which is not, and I quite like what I hear on this one."
4,How did this one get by me for so long.,"Well, I watched the newest episode of That Metal Show and this was the pick of the week, which led me to buying the mp3 download version of this. I always dug John Sykes and thought Blue Murder was great as well. This is a completely awsome release. Such a great live album, and who would of thought that he could pull off the David Coverdale vocals as well as he does. So glad to have found this and cant wait for some more Sykes with Portnoy behind him."
4,john sykes bad boy live,i've always liked johns playing abilities since i first realized who he is when i bought blue murder cassette back in the mid 80's also saw his interview on that metal show and always liked whitesnake john does ezcellent vocals on this c/d worth getting to remember whitesnake time
3,Eh...decent.,"I ordered these for our Candyland themed Christmas tree this year. They're okay. I purchased them for $21.... saw a very comparable strand at a discount store for $5. These are very cheap looking. The white is actually like a sugar coating. I was expecting something wayyyy more decent for the price. I mixed these with the gingerbread lights and it looks alright on the tree.... just alright.I suggest shopping around prior to buying these. They're really not as nice as the picture, but they'll do for this Christmas."
5,tincture of benzoin,A difficult product to find in local stores works great for cleansing minor wounds & helps bandages stick in tough areas.
5,Make it stick,Sometime you need a little help getting tape or a bandaid to stick. Especially in hot weather. This is the best stuff to do the trick.Geritrex Benzoin Compound Tincture - 1 Oz
5,"If you want to make yourself stick, this is for you","Does what it's supposed to: makes your skin sticky as h e double toothpicks. I use it when I need to keep compression running gear in place on my legs during a long, sweaty race. Just put a little of this on a swab, make a few lines (it's brown, so easy to see) across the thigh, ankle, calf, or wherever, and wait a minute for it to dry. Your compression gear won't move. I also use it for its more normal use of pre treating areas that are going to get athletic tape or bandages. This stuff plus a 3M waterproof bandage means 3 days without a bandage change, even if you sweat like a sprinkler."
1,Obviously not written by a Griff breeder,"What an insult to Griff breeders this book is. It is written by a writer who writes a lot of books about dogs, but he obviously never owned a Griff. The Griff has very special characteristics and needs, which the writer does not know. He probably used the same material to write about every other breed of dog, but Griffs are not just like other dogs.Skip this book. The only good Griff book is by Doone Raynham but hard to get."
4,"Functional, but not great","We just wanted something to transport eggs for picnics that had a cover. It is flimsy, but it was inexpensive compared to the ""nice"" egg holders. It does what it says, it holds eggs. The eggs tend to slide around and the fit of eggs in the groove is loose. I would recommend it for the price."
4,Great product but...,"I bought 2 of these as in-feed/out-feed tables for my wood shop. Great product but they are difficult to assemble. And on one of them, I simply couldn't get the feet level. Nonetheless, I use them all the time."
2,disappointed,"Since we have installed this extra camera in my second child's room we find that the original camera doesn't work as well. Both cameras are very staticy and completely black out from time to time. When the camera seems to be acting up it automatically switches back to the orignal camera, which is annoying when I am trying to look in on room 2. For the money, we spent about $250.00 for the orignial and extra camera. Next time I would just by 2 of the less expensive 100.00 cameras for each room."
2,Second camera for second child,"We purchased a second camera to keep eyes on our second child. After he was born we hooked up the second camera, and it immediately started interfering with the first camera. Both channels now have lots of static and the screen will show the image for a second, and then go black. Our house is only 1700 sq feet so distance should not be an issue. We expected both channels to be just as clear as it was when we only used one camera, but we're very disapointed. We LOVED our Summer Infant Video monitor before trying to add a second camera. Customer support at Summer was very nice, but not very helpful."
3,A lot of Static from Extra Camera,We got the extra camera along with the original camera/monitor. When we used it just with the one camera and on one channel it worked fine. As soon as we added the second camera on the second channel it caused a lot of static. If we move the monitor a few inches it goes from clear to static. Im not too happy about this but there is nothing I can do now except find a non-static spot to put the monitor in when it is on.
3,Great when it works,"When it works, the 2nd camera is great, but its reception is inconsistent.I Bought the second camera to monitor our twins with the same parent unit. We put this on channel B and the original camera on channel A. Like a prior reviewer said, the original does have slightly better color quality, but the 2nd camera is pretty good too so the difference is not enough to prevent buying the 2nd camera.However, while the reception on the original camera is great anywhere in the house, we get spotty reception on the 2nd camera depending on where the parent's unit (handheld monitor) is. I'd say we get it only 40% of the time walking around the house. Luckily, it works where we need it most (by my bed) so I'm relatively happy with the second camera."
4,Good item with a little glitch,I bought this extra camera for my daughter's new room when I was expecting my second child since I hadn't had any problems with the first monitor. Aside from a little static on the B channel I was happy with the results. Yes I do get static in certain areas but I just move the monitor around a little and it does the trick. The peace of mind of seeing the two rooms with one flick of a switch outweighs the static.
4,Outstanding quality!,"This extra camera for Summer Infant handheld monitor is as outstanding as its original camera and monitor set. Both picture and sound is great day or night. I haven't found better product with 2 cameras. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that Channel B doesn't have as good frequency in my house as Channel A. That goes for the original camera as well as the extra. But with some effort, once a good spot is found, Channel B works well."
5,perfect,This is perfect for giving little one's some space of their own. I have 1 on crib and the other covers the rest of the room so she can play by herself with out me being ontop of her and I can still make sure shes safe and not getting in to trouble.
5,Second Camera,"I bought this as a second camera to go with the camera and monitor I already had. I can easily watch children in two separate rooms with the addition of this second camera. It was easy to install, gives a clear picture and good sound. Allows me to have camera A and camera B on the same monitor making it easy to keep tabs on two locations."
4,Great!,The best way to see whats happening with your baby being far away from his bedroom. I recommend 100%!
3,Relaxing but not good if you have a plastic kind of tub,"I purchased this item quite some time ago. At the time of purchase I had a bathtub that was the plastic-like kind. This product will not affix to this sort of tub. However I recently moved to a place with a regular style tub and the suction cups work great. This product does run more loudly than I expected, but does provide as promised a wonderful tub full of bubbles.I too noticed that the air tended to cool the water, but solved this problem by running the bath hotter than I normally would. Overall I like it although it isn't something you use for a ""quick"" bath."
2,Very noisey,"Although it is very powerful, it is also very noisey. Imagine being in your bathtub with a running vacuum cleaner right next to the tub. That is the effect. It is very effective in turning the tub into a bubble spa, however I would suggest earplugs if you are tring to use it to relax."
5,Great Service,The cors arrived in a times manner. Function as they should. What more can one ask for?
4,Joe from Wantagh,"Good product. Composit cables were the best cables back then, go with HDMI cables today if possible."
1,"""How I Can Sell You on Breastfeeding Until Your Child is 4""","I was so offended by this book. I found it incredibly condescending. It was basically a list of reasons why one might stop breastfeeding and instead of offering the best way to wean under the circumstances Huggins proceeds to handle the reason like an objection and then tells you your reason isn't good enough and comes up with reasons why and how you can keep nursing. The decision of when to wean is incredibly personal and I don't need this author to tell me why my reason isn't good enough. My baby is nine months old and I am planning on weaning around her first birthday. I was looking to this book to show me techniques on how to wean gently, not to make me feel guilty for not nursing until she's four! She also tries to make it seems like giving your baby formula is akin to giving them poison - please! Don't waste your money!"
2,Very disappointed!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had hoped to get guidance on how to begin weaning my 1-year-old daughter. Instead, the book provides a detailed history of breastfeeding and recounts the experiences of many breastfeeding mothers. I found the _Nursing Mother's Companion_ to be excellent, and had hoped for the same quality of information from this book. There's a brief mention of techniques, but no guidance on how to use them. I feel more confused after reading this book. It was a waste of money. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
2,"Great for cultural perspectives, Poor for actual weaning.","I actually give this book 5 stars for historical and cultural/social perspective on nursing and weaning but 2 stars for the actual process of weaning.I felt this book really tried to sway a Mom to not wean even at 2-3 years old! The actual weaning processes could have been written in 4 pages and disbursed as a pamphlet.I really came away from this book with the same knowledge as I had when I started to read it.So, if you are looking for a book to read to gather information on nursing in general as it relates to history and culture then this book is fantastic.But if you are looking for just some good practical advice and support then this book will most likely not help you."
2,Pretty useless . . . .,"I though that Kathleen Huggin's book on breastfeeding was terrific, but this one is a bomb. Although some readers will probably think that the first chapter on the cultural and histroical aspects of nursing is a yawner, it was actually my favorite part of the book. (It didn't help me with my weaning concern; I just thought it was interesting.) Like other reviewers, I perceived the book to be more a list of reasons that you might be considering weaning (and ideas to help you get around whatever your reason is) and less information on the actual process of weaning. Personally, I am a proponent of breastfeeding past one year, but I figure if you're reading a book on weaning, it should be about weaning."
2,Not very practicle advice for weaning,"I was very dissappointed by this book, especially after reading Kathleen Huggins first book on breast feeding. Instead of offering the same kind of practicle advice on weaning, it was more arguments against weaning. Most of the book was written in this style...""if you are thinking of weaning because you've got this problem.. then try this instead"", and the book then proceeded to para-phrase her first book. There was not much actual advice on weaning, just alot of talk on why society doesn't accept breastfeeding. This working mom found no help in this book, just more arguments for breastfeeding, which If I wasn't already indoctrinated to, this book added its own arguments for, making one feel guilty if you didn't continue feeding for three years. If you want to wean your baby, this isn't the book for you. If on the other hand you wish to continue feeding for longer than a year, this is the book to get for your critics!"
4,There should be one more CD like this.....,"Sublime is just one of those bands where their songs are SOOOOO great that if you bought their CD's, you'd still be listening to them years down the line on a regular basis. That's a good reason why this album came out, unreleased songs to satisfy the appetites of hardcore Sublime fans who's hearts were broken after Bradley's death. Anyways, I wanna let people know out there, that there's PLENTY more unreleased Sublime songs where this came from. At least a good 30 songs, many WAY better than the tracks on this CD. I hope one day another Sublime CD would be released with those songs, but in the mean time you could look for them online. Oh yeah, this album does kick ass, out of the four, it's third behind 40 oz and self titled but a step ahead of Robbin the Hood. R.I.P Bradley, no one will ever come close to you..."
4,Good Legacy,"Being as this is essentially a B-Sides album you can pretty much tell from the beginning that it will not be as good as the others. But that doesn't make it bad and considering that it is the closest we'll ever get to a fourth studio album I'll certainly take it and be happy. Most of these songs are in fact top notch quality, and the remixes of the older songs are particularly interesting especially garbage grove and the two doin' time remixes, both extremely different from each other and the original song. If you like Sublime you will like this album so if you are hesitant on buying it, don't be, just don't expect another instant classic."
2,The inevitable leftovers - Buyer beware,"The instinct to cash in on their well-earned reputation as a landmark band of the nineties was perhaps too much for the surviving members of Sublime to resist, hence this release.Most of tracks presented here are sub-par versions of previously released material. It would be of interest to hardcore fans and others who are curious as to the evolution of their songs, but there is little else here to sustain interest over any period of time."
1,what the heck happened?,"Dude, this CD has absolutely no good songs on it. The tracks just seem like they were tossed together on the spot without any practice first. Not to say I don't like Sublime though, because I have their debut and it's really good. This CD however is weak and ought not to be purchased."
4,Just as good as any other sublime cd if not better,"This album is much better than robbin the hood, and i listen to this album more than 40 ounces or the self titled. Their live album is also pretty good. The first 4 tracks are great. I absolutely love the ubtown dub version of doin time (the first track). ""Get Out"" is really good. ""Romeo"" is awesome. New Realization is good. I never liked don't push that much and it's on 40 oz. Slow ride is alright. The version of chic on my tip on 40 ounces is better. Had a dat is good, trenchtown rock is very good. Badfish i can never get sick of. Saw red is excellent and so is superstar punani. Basically i like most of the songs. I would pay 40 bucks for just the first four songs. I only give it four stars because i don't like every song and everybody inflates this rating system like mad, most people are pretty dumb."
4,Good,"I like this cd, I like basically every Sublime cd except ""robin the hood"". This has some great songs on it, like ""date rape"" and ""chick on my tip."" This cd was under-rated. It's worth buying if you're a fan."
3,Not so Hot,"If you are expecting classic Sublime, you might be dissapointed. While there are some bright moments, it's easy to see they ""cleaned out the closet"" for some of this stuff. A must for any Sublime collection, but it doesn't get much play around here. I'd much rather lisen to ""Stand by your van"" or ""Robbin the hood""."
4,DON'T BE MAD AT SUBLIME,"PEOPLE SAY THIS ALBUM WAS HASTILY PUT TOGETHER, AND YOUR RIGHT. AFTER BRAD DIED ERIC AND BUD TOOK ALL THE OLD RECORDINGS AND ANYTHING THAT THEY RECORDED AND MADE THIS ALBUM. IT'S NOT THE NOT THE BEST OF SUBLIME. BUT THEY WANTED TO PUT SOMETHING OUT FOR US TO ENJOY. I DID AND YOU WOULD TO IF YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON, SO WOULD YOU. GREAT ALBUM. RIP BRAD"
3,Sublime - 'Second Hand Smoke' (MCA),"'Second Hand Smoke' is strictly previously unreleased material and remixed versions of the band's tunes from earlier CD's.A couple of tracks I thought sort of stood out were ""Saw Red"",""Chick On My Tip"",""Get Out"",""Drunk Drivin'"" and ""Legal Dub"".Basically,if you like their other releases,you should like this.To the outsider,it's an okay disc to check out when you can."
3,It's alright.,"This album is rather hastily put together and is stylistically uneven, even for a retrospective outtakes record. The songs themselves are hit-and-miss; some of my faves are ""Doin' Time"" (both mixes), ""New Realization,"" ""Get Out!,"" ""Trenchtown Rock,"" and ""Superstar Punani."" Frankly, the rest of the album is pretty throwaway: it includes ""Saw Red"" and ""Badfish,"" which really are filler to sell records, and the rest of the material really deserved to stay unreleased: some early 4-track demos, some SUBLIME session material (mostly incomplete), and a final dub (i.e., vocals excised) of one of the most boring damn tracks Sublime released. This album overall is worth it, though, simply on the fair strength of one half of the record and the stronger second half."
4,Leftunders and overs,"Good stuff for rabid, foaming-at-the-mouth Sublime fans who want it all, contains both very early, very middle, and very late songs."
2,Second-Hand Is Second Rate,"For all you guys that know Sublime, you also know this CD was put out to cash on Sublime's short and sudden success after Bradley Nowell's death. Bradley was the heart and soul of Sublime and without him they could not go on, so they released this CD of unreleased songs and remixes. Some songs are good, and others mediocre. Bradley Nowell never performed a bad song, so either way this CD is still worth your money. I would reccomend buying 40 Oz. and Bradley Nowell Acoustic. If you have those already, then buy the self titled CD (Which was largely over-rated)... Second Hand Smoke should be last on your list of Sublime CD's to get... Only get it if you are a huge fan."
3,"This CD was okay, but I was disappointed.","This wasn't a bad CD, but it was definitely not up to the standards of the group. Sublime is one of my favorite groups, but I was kind of bored when I was listening to this CD. I don't recommend this CD. Their other CDs are so much better; this is a waste of money. If I had never heard any of the other albums, I might have been more satisfied with this one, but since I have, it did not meet my expectations."
3,"Some of the songs were good, but many sounded the same.","If you're a major Sublime fan, you'll enjoy this CD, but if you are looking for their best work, you won't find it here. I was a tad dissapointed. ""40 oz to Freedom"" is a much better selection."
5,No Frills.... Just a Great Performance,"Jones is a true original. She's known for intimate performances and this DVD captures her at her best. The only minor complaint is the absence of her interaction with the audience. I guess she was just in a quiet mood that night. Her dialogues between songs are often very humorous as well as informative about how some of her songs came to be. As I said, a very minor complaint. This is a truly spirited performance from a great musical maverick.It contains many of her originals as well as Jazz and Pop standards from the 30's through the 60's.Sit back with a good bottle of wine (maybe two) and some chesse and enjoy!"
5,your ears will ring for hours after listening to it,"this may be a debut, but steelheart knows what they are doing. one listen to matijevic's howl all through the album and your ears will RRRRRing for hours."
3,IF YOU LIKED STEEL DRAGON .......,"Then you will most likely enjoy this band. The singer of Steelheart was one of the 'real' vocals in the band Steel Dragon. As most of you know,Steel Dragon was the band in the movie Rock Star.I must admit that it's been awhile since I listened to this cd but I do remember there where some good songs on it. If you enjoy bands like Danger Danger or Bon Jovi with a harder edge then you will like Steelheart."
4,Very cool debut from Steelheart,"Steelheart are one of those bands that you hate to admit to anyone that you like, but i'll be totally honest, I love what these guys did with their first two records.There really isn't any way that fans of the melodic rock genre wouldn't absolutely love this record. The songs are all catchy and loaded with melody, and Mike just kicks that crap out of the vocals on this record. Songs like ""Can't Stand Me Loving You"", ""Love Ain't Easy"", ""Down n' Dirty"" ""Like Never Before"", and of course one of the best ballads ever written, ""I'll Never Let You Go"" are all teriffic, and make you wanna crank these babies up to eleven.Honestly like I already stated, this album is great throughout. While I don't think this album is five-stars, it's pretty darn close to perfect."
5,Steelheart ...Steel (metal) sound.,"Great hair band metal is what you will hear on this cd. It has your ballad metal and also your in your face guitar wailing solos. Some of the best vocal in Heavy Metal can be found here on this cd. If you saw/enjoyed the movie & soundtrack to ""Rock Star"" with Mark Walberg then give this cd a listen. It is Michael Matijevic voice that you hear when Mark Walberg sings in the movie. A good all around hair band cd."
5,Steelheart,Totally love this Cd. Very good music. I remember their music from the 90's and they are great. Really cool CD. Would recommend to buy...
4,Exactly what I remembered,"I owned this album back when it was originally released, saw it on here had to get it back again. I am a musical trash-can-junkie. I like just about everything to one extent or another. Being that I learned to play guitar listening to late-80's Hair Metal, I am much more lax on what I own from that period. My friend and I often joke that the song, ""Never Let You Go,"" is ""the song that killed Metal."" Some people remember this song as being called, ""Angel Eyes,"" because of the first line from each verse. It was the only song that really charted from the album and with the rest of the songs pushing 5 minuted or more it's understandable. They use just about every 80's Metal trick in the book. But with one of the best metal singers at the helm and great guitar work with extended solos, this album is a great addition to anyone that thinks the devil horns are made with the thumb out."
3,Christian Metal,"Well the best known track here got them on Monster Ballads. The high pitch vocals compliment the harmonized guitars. Fans of early 90s/ 90s metal can't go wrong. The vocals are excellent. Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) produces this album. The ballad here is aweome, though the rest of the songs aren't as intense. Key tracks are: I'll Never Let You Go, She's Gone, and Sheila. It's pretty good."
5,Amazing and Powerful Band...,"In few words, Steeheart the album, if you gotta own this! This is one of the most brilliant and powerful bands from the 90s, great vocals...this guy can scream, too good."
1,Major Rip Off!,"The Vac will not work without this stupid bottle. The bottle is very expensive for soapy water. Yes, you can re-fill it, until the bottle breaks, about one refill before the bottle does break. They intentionally designed this bottle to break so you have to keep buying them."
4,H.E.Bates meets Updike,"It's an oldfashioned adventure story in that its 'hero' is an average guy who reacts to circumstances as best he can (as H E Bates 'hero's' did) and there's no nonsense nor silly/convenient coincidences. And, although there's a lot of sex in it none of it is gratuitous and (like Updike) only as much as would happen in real life. A good, enjoyable read."
5,The Real Thing,"If you have ever wondered what a real man, a real woman, or a real something in-between is, this is a must read. ""My Gender Workbook"" has interactive exercises, advice, and guidance on gender, and provokes the reader to question the whole idea of gender as an absolute. We all have elements of each gender, and Bornstein goes to the point of arguing that there are many genders, not just two, and it is possible to lack gender entirely. As a transgendered person myself, I found the book enlightening and helpful in my own discovery of gender, and who I really am. In fact, this is one of the most useful books I have found on gender identity, and I refer back to it often."
2,Overly simplistic,"I used this book in a college class, and from an academic standpoint, I found it simplistic and many of the exercises seemed pointless. Even worse, Bornstein advocates a ""gender-free or gender-bent"" presentation of oneself, not realizing that because society creates gender rules, becoming gender-free is still buying into those rules through one's rejection of them. I think everyone should work through their gender issues on their own and not feel bad if they do happen to be a very feminine woman or masculine man (this book assumes every reader doesn't fit into any stereotype, or if they do act stereotypically male or female, it's not because they want to.) From the standpoint of someone reading this book casually, it's very affirming of our differences, but don't forget to read other gender-theory books as well."
2,"Not impressive--too much theory, too much hokeyness","I'm not as impressed as I'd hoped to be by this book--it's playful but obnoxiously heavily theory-oriented. Bornstein spends forever discussing the time ze spends on MOOs rather than talking about how gender is done in the real world.And then ze starts to talk about gender and science, and it's clear she's never even written to any of the scientists she's caricaturing. Instead, we get told that there's the ""bad"" scientists (conventional ones), and the ""exciting, clever, good"" scientists (chaos theorists).'Scuse me? There's a hell of a lot of interesting, gender-conformity-challenging science being done in biology labs. And not much science about gender at all in chaos theory centers. The author doesn't know what is meant by chaos theory, except maybe having watched Jurassic Park.Perhaps Bornstein should spend a little time offline in the real world."
3,When he finally came out of the closet,"I think Breathing Underwater is a great book for mature readers. It starts when Nick Andreas is on trial for abusing his ex-girlfriend. The book quickly takes off when Nick has to write a journal that includes all about his and Cat's relationship; Nick also had to go to anger management classes. Nick loses his friends, his first true love, and everything that his money couldn't buy. His father says that he was a mistake and always degrades Nick and hits him almost daily. Nick is a football player, a hero and a friend, but when the world finds out about his abusive relationship he becomes a nobody and no one cares who he was and they see his real side.I think this book should be read in every tenth grade English class. The book shows what could happen in teenage relationships. The book also shows the signs of abuse and what you shouldn't do while in a abusive relationship. I also think the suspense between journal entries was the best I have seen."
5,A ...Book of Note,"This is an exceptionally compassionate, yet realistic story of one young man's unconscious choice to follow in his father's footsteps, and the consequences it has on his life. A series of physical outbursts against his girlfriend (not to mention ongoing verbal assault) land Nick in court, and he finds himself without the support of family or friends. With the help of a counseling program, and a journal assignment from the judge, Nick tries to figure out how he became a person he neither likes nor understands. Given its subject matter, any success Breathing Underwater achieves almost assures that controversy will follow. That said, it is my opinion that it should be mandatory reading at Junior High level, and stacks of copies should be donated to crisis centers, women's shelters, and child abuse prevention programs everywhere."
4,Relatable,"At first, when I began reading Breathing Underwater I was a little offended with the events that were happening in the book. Between Nick's father beating on Nick and the men in Nick's anger management class being so insensitive towards life, women, and all people's feelings; I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good read. The book surprised me and was extremely good and exciting to read. I liked the way the author made the book so realistic. It shows that everyone has problems no matter how perfect their lives may seem top be. I also liked how it shows that things can and will get better no matter how bad things seem to be right now. Things may have to get worse before they get better, but change is possible if you allow it. I ended up really liking Breathing Underwater and I would recommend it, especially to teenage readers. I'm not even a bi reader and I wanted to always keep reading to finish the book."
4,good.,"I liked this book. It was very short so if you don't have a lot of time, this is a good book to pick up. I thought Nick's behavior and reactions to his life were all very believable. In other words, it seemed less like fiction. I really liked the different people he met at his weekly meetings (as well as the stories that went along with them) and also that the entire book is written in diary entries.My only gripe is that the book wrapped up a little too quickly and easily."
5,Breathing Underwater,The book is o.k. but that is not Amazon's fault just the book wasn't that good to me. The other books from this auther is great Beastly is awesome.
4,an unique read,"at the beginning of this book I hated the main character so much I almost stopped reading it. This guy was a sick, abusive, stalker. His ex-girlfriend who has a restraining order against him, dropped her pen and he kept it and liked to put it in his mouth and bring it everywhere.Eww! Sick! loser!Through his jounal entries you learn how he goes from loving his girl friend to becoming suspicious of her and controlling and abusive. He eventually gives her such a beating, and in public, that she can't forgive him.This was highly unpleasant subject matter and I read two silly, girly books after it to calm myself down. Yet, this teaches an important lesson and I won't easily forget it.A book about an abusive boyfreind about to violate his restraining order and land himself in prison may not sound like a fun book to read, and it's not, but I don't regret reading it.So, creepy, disturbing, and scary, but with a good lesson."
3,Good,"The ending was very unclear. Overall, not bad. A good read. It is a bit confusing in the end though."
2,Oops,"Ok, I admit it was my fault for thinking that Breathing Underwater would be a fairytale retelling of The Little Mermaid, but I mean, that IS what Alex Flinn is known for writing... However, we follow Nick through is Diary and trips to Anger Management and we see how he is abused and how he becomes the abuser in a romantic relationship and honestly, a little after being half way through I saw where this book was heading and was over it. Nick is a character who is really difficult to like, it is hard to be like ""oh poor boy, who was abused"". Personally, just skip it."
2,"scary, realistic book!","omg, this book brings you into such a reality of teens that it's like cold water! It still gives me the creeps even if I read it in 6th! Uh!"
1,She was a decent one,"I personally thought this book started slow, however, it gradually revealed what a sick person Nick Andreas really was. When his ex-girlfriend Caitlen McCourt got a restraining order against him he lost everything. His best friend of many years stopped talking to him. When Nick goes to counceling, he is still in denial. When he begins writing in his notebook he reveals how he really treated Caitlen."
5,Always pleased with Zoo Med products,"I have used these fluorescent bulbs for many years, and I am very pleased with them. They give out plenty of UVB light"
5,This was a lifesaver,"It revived my panther chameleon who was slowly becoming lethargic because I foolishly forgot to change his previous UVB bulb. I am not sure if I will have his on for the next 6 months because I read that panther chams should only have 5.0 UVB and this is twice the intensity. His vet said this was fine to use even if its a 10.0 but I will research some more and maybe use it for a month before I switch back to the 5.0. Any feedback on wether this is ok to use long term would be appreciated! But at least, my cham is now up and about!!!"
3,"Decent, considering the low price.","This camera does shoot nice pictures, although it cannot photograph close-ups very well. The flash is VERY bright, and will wash-out your subject if it is too close.This camera has a few nice settings and features, such as red-eye flash, which eliminates red-eye.The video quality is mediocre, and CANNOT record well at all in low-light settings. It is best to record in bright sunlight or flourescent lights, rather than the light of the average living-room.However, if you are just looking for a cheap camera to give as a gift to your little aspiring photographer child, this camera would make a very nice start."
3,decent,"I put a CD of mine that I brought in from home and basically took some time out to ajust the bass and treble which each go from -3 to 3. I had the impression that there was a graphic equalizer on it with 4 settings, but I couldnt find it. I did however find a some sort of bass enhancement switch or something which added an interesting sound when it was on, although it sounded good off as well. The sound was nice for that price range but the projection was a bit soft for a larger room I would think. My opinion, I would definetly think of using it in a smaller bedroom or other small spot or listen to it at closer a range situation."
1,very poor sound and radio,"bought this as a present for someone - sound was so bad, and radio reception so poor, that I took it back to the store and replaced it with a Philips MCM530, admittedly a more expensive unit ($150 vs $100).- embarrasing."
4,A bunch of people stuck in an elevator--the tension rises!,"Okay, the gore level rises too. This ends up being very bloody by the end, although I will not reveal why. A large group of people get stuck in an elevator, and it turns out that one of them had a bomb strapped to her to take revenger on the company owner. The others are merely there by accident. You wouldn't think the suspense could be maintained with people standing around, but the script and actors make it work along with good direction."
5,A Gripping Thriller,"What an amazing film. I was at the edge of my seat. As you watched it, you felt the characters' panic and fear. Terrific script, amazing directing, and the actors were terrific. Must see!!!"
4,Defective disc,This was a well made thriller until about 35 minutes into the picture when it just froze and that was that. Tried two different copies with no luck. Make sure you can return it for a second try and refund if that doesn't work.
3,Decent thriller...bad marketing on the cover.,"Decent for a B rate horror/thriller. Acting isn't the best...as expected...Worth watching though. Buzz from Home Alone is in it all grown up, probably the best actor in the movie."
2,Elevator,"Take a ride to the Seventh Circle of Hell (otherwise known as sheer boredom) in Stig Svendsen's new Thriller: ELEVATOR. Nine strangers are left stranded in a high-rise elevator on their way to an elite party on Wall Street when one of them is discovered to have a bomb! ELEVATOR makes several flailing attempts at social significance, conveying weakened messages against racism, terrorism, and corporate greed that only serve to annoy rather than incite. Like DEVIL and BLACKOUT before it, ELEVATOR broadcasts its ""twists"" well in advance, leaving the audience to suffer through the poor performances and weakly-scripted melodrama with no surprises to show for them. The rest of the cast may have been slightly more tolerable were it not for Joey Slotnick's incessant behavior, which is reason enough to hit the 'Eject' button on this suspenseless Thriller. The Coen Brothers, this is not.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,Not very comfortable,I did not find this product to be very comfortable. The contact points were hard and would hurt if put near certain areas near your shoulder blades. I used to have the panasonic stick wand which I found to be easier to use without assistance and it had rubber rollers which where more comfortable
3,Big and heavy,This product works well but is quite cumbersome. The extra long cord makes it easy to plug in and use anywhere.
1,Basura impresa,"Este libro es una basura. Ahora resulta que usan la Biblia para decirnos que debemos y que no debemos leer, como si fuera un manual de instrucciones para la vida. Si es así, entonces que lapiden a los adúlteros, que se apruebe la poligamia, etc. ¿Acaso es pecado soñar y fantasear? Me parece ridículo en extremo este libro, el mío se fue directo al bote de basura."
3,Too thick and hard (can be a problem),"I bought this for my boyfriend who drives hundreds of miles every week and has back problems. I thought he could put it in the car and his driving pains would be over. He used it for about a week but said that the vibrations were too strong, even at the lowest possible setting and also that the cushiong was too thick and made him sit too high at the wheel, even with the seat set at its lowest point (he has a Ford Explorer). So it now sits in a closet. He did like the heat and said that relaxed him a lot but the sitting higher caused more problems."
2,"Personally, it just feels awful.","I guess some folks like it, but found it to be incredibly uncomfortable. The worst feature must be the cushion upon which one sits; the motors under ones thighs are hard as rocks. In addition, the single region that has the ""shiatsu"" feature hits me squarely between the shoulder blades, where it is no fun at all. The heat feature and multizonal vibration settings work well enough, but as I already have seat heaters, what I'm left with here is basically a vibrator. I am going to keep searching, as this one will not do."
4,"Great massager, reasonable price","This massager feels great. The motors cover every section of your back. The percussion actions is also a great feature. Though they tend to be rather strong, their intensity can be turned down. The only downfall to this massager is its noise. It is not extremely loud, but it does produce a decent amount of noise. It will also vibrate anything that it touches. I would highly recommend this massager."
5,"WOW, HoMedics jBK-900- WOW","Well, ordered on 8/22/02, finally rec'd on 9/23 (today) kicks!! I bought it for Xmas for DH as he drives 2-3 hrs ONE WAY each day. The movement, pressure, heat is like a REAL MASSAGE, from your neck down your legs! I have been using it all day b/c I have some back/hip/shoulder pain and I really felt great after 30 minutes!!I will say, in waiting as I write, the box I rec'd says 8 Motors and my order says 10, so not sure if it IS the same, but, man, what a GREAT GIFT!!!THIS IS THE ADULT 'TOY' Christmas of 2002!!!"
1,Defective on arrival,"Oh well. Mostly very positive reviews induced me to buy this, and a working one might be fine. But mine arrived with 5 of the 6 preprogrammed functions not working. So, the product takes a hit in this review for poor quality."
5,"Wonderful, Shocking Book",Who would suspect that so many famous people did such weird things to get started? I'm amazed that nobody has written a book like this before. It's almost unbelievable.Wonderful reading. Oh yes. Oy! Such a book!
3,Good+Disappointing,"The performance by Collin Davis was excellent but the transfer onto DVD was not good. And I don't understand why the the company(Image Entertainment) did not provide English subtitles(lyrics). If more sincere efforts had been given, this could have been very enjoyable and thumbs up."
5,A Neat Anthology Of Zen Essays & Writings From Both East & West,"Mrs. Ross has done a great job compiling a number of essays, stories, and poetic selections in this anthology which covers writers and Zen practitioners from both the Orient and Occident. From essays on Zen's relation to Western science & psychotherapy to poetry & art inspired by Zen culture, this is a very concise and realistic view of Zen Buddhism. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about the Zen tradition."
2,Simply excerpts,"For those who have read many of the writers excerpted in this book, it's a disappointment."
4,My First Bass,"I have had the bass for a week and it has been great fun. While I have one ordered, I did not have an amp so I have just been playing and listening to the guitar ""unplugged"". As someone new to the bass, I was disappointed that there was no owner's manual included. I do have a question for any reader with experience on this bass guitar. It looks as if there is a place for a battery(ies). I did not take out the screws because I thought they may be holding the neck on. Does this guitar require batteries? If so, what kind? Will the neck come off if I open the compartment?I will update my review when I get the amp"
5,on my top ten crime list,"I read this book about 15 years ago. One of the best crime stories I ever read: immaculate plot, interesting ethnic setting, well told, funny. Highly recommended."
2,Music doesn't really have much to do with an Italian wedding,"We've become experts on Italian wedding CDs since our granddaughter got married. ..we bought them all. This CD is somewhat fun to sing along to, though I think the arrangements could be less hokey, but it really has little or nothing to do with an Italian wedding. Bridal couples who want traditional Italian Wedding music shouldn't be duped into spending 20 bucks for this. It is irritating that they use this marketing tactic to influence sales. It is just a bunch of Italian kareoke songs, nothing more. If you are looking for true Italian wedding music, this is NOT the CD for you."
3,No difference,I don't see a difference between this product and many others. Cranberry supplements do seem to help me avoid bladder infections.
3,Not my favorite,"Inexpensive, but the powder in these capsules can go bad quickly. I prefer the liquid gels much more. These can also be hard to swallow. So not the best."
2,Eh...,"I noticed absolutely no results from taking this. Look for a better source/supplement. This is not worth the money, try another brand."
3,Good Effort By An Underrated Group,"Allure ""Chapter III"" marks the 3rd album by this beautiful, talented, yet highly underrated group from the NYC. The album does have its high points: ""Hate 2 Luv U"" is a song that makes you feel like it's summer lovin' all over again, ""Long Lost Love"" and ""Frustration"" are pure R&B;/Soul at its tightest, and ""Sitting At Home"" sways like a swing at the playground. However, a few tracks take a while to really get into: ""Can't Stay Here With You"" has an odd ragga beat but the girls harmonize so sweetly throughout, ""Uh Oh"" is a groovy reggae/dancehall track with a cloudy hook, and ""Relax and Unwind"" requires a few listens before you really feel it.Overall, a solid effort from Allure. Highlights include: ""Hate 2 Luv U"", ""Long Lost Love"", ""Sitting At Home"" and ""Frustration""."
2,Free Artest,"This is the much-ballyhooed album that Ron Artest tried to promote non-stop and also the cause of a 2-game suspension. Now that Ron-Ron has been suspended for the season he can keep on promoting this. It's the first album I have seen with the producer credit on the front! I dunno, the only Allure songs I liked was from back then. I'm not really feeling this album. Artest even has a cameo appearance and I'm sorry, but he can't rap. TruWarier indeed."
3,What a Shame... 3 1/2 stars for effort,"I used to love this group with their first two albums, but with the departure of Linnie and a major label it definitely shows negatively on this album. My favorite would be "" Let Him Go"", ""Relax and Unwind"", which took a couple of listens,""Stay"", and ""Long Lost Love"" . There's great ballads which are better than the uptempos. On the flipside, you do get to see more vocal skills from Lalisha and Akissa. They need to get on a better known record label and get their stuff heard. Don't count these girls out, I'll still support ya'll thats what a real Allure fan does."
5,Support Ron Artest,I think this album is really good. I think its good because Ron Artest is the CEO of this group and Ron Artest is the man. I think suspending him for the rest of the season was bad because he did not deserve that and he was only protecting himself. i mean if someone threw a cup of beer at me id be pretty mad and especially if it landed on my chest. and ron artest is a good man and he is cool in every way. also ron artest is from queensbridge and you dont F' with someone from queensbridge and thats cool. Ron Artest is my idol. because he beat up 3 people. if you like ron artest and you support his great effort then purchase this album now.
3,Disappointed,"As someone pretty new to reformers, I was disappointed with this video for two reasons: a good portion of the exercises require the additional box--no mention was made about that in the description of the video; also, it is not always clear how many springs you should be working on. I have a reformer at home, and don't have an unlimited budget for extra equipment (the box and pole are not cheap) or one on one lessons with an instructor. (One exercise is even performed on the big barrel--who has that at home??) It seems this video, which I'm sure is sound in technique, is for people who are in a studio environment, not the home user."
3,It's Cheap for a Reason,"I love 7th Heaven and have been patiently waiting for them each to be released. I pre-ordered this DVD for Season 9 and I was terribly disappointed. I own Seasons 1-8 and all of them have a ""Play all"" feature. This season is the first that does not, which means you can only play each show one at a time.Very frustrating. If it wasn't such a pain, I'd return it."
3,"Love the series....unfortunately, poorly made DVDs","Love 7th Heaven-it's nice to have the collection on DVD. However, this is possibly the cheapest, poorly produced set of DVDs I own. I own many tv series and they are done very well-full episode, no cuts, original music, extras included.7th Heaven has none of the above. With DVDs produced so cheaply, the price ought to be much less also, IMO.Glad to have the collection, just wish QUALITY had gone into making these. Two more seasons left-10, 11. Wish they would at least do something special (i.e. extras) on the last season released."
5,Family friendly,This show is a great one to share with your family. It teaches good morals and has a lot of life lessons.
1,False Advertising + Worst Service Ever,"I ordered this item thinking it was the actual baton case, and it turned out being just a nylon case cover even though the advertised picture shows the wood baton case and nothing of the nylon case. I talked to the customer service from woodwind-brasswind, who I actually ordered this from, and it took me four phone calls over the span of a month for them to tell me that I ordered the nylon case only! So amazon.com advertised the selling of the wood case and sent me a nylon case. When I called to ask where my wood case was, they sent me another nylon case. All in all they ended up sending me 3 nylon cases over the span on a month, and now informed me that I had not purchased the wood case, but only purchased the nylon case even though the wood case was advertised. Now I'm off to go through the long process of returning these cases so I can get reimbursed. What a shame, Buyer Beware!"
1,Wish I could find where to return it . . .,"I used my Paster Master for the first time, followed directions to a tee, and even though the pasta turned out great, the plastic cylinder cracked from top to bottom in two places rendering it completely useless to me. I have the instruction page but not an address as to where to return the item. I don't recommend this product at all. I imagine there are similar manufacturers who make far superior products that cook pasta the same way. Try them instead of this one."
2,nice size but doesn't work well,"With our third child, we needed an additional monitor, and this one was appealing for it's portability. But, it has a clicking sound and poor reception at only 30 feet from our baby's room, and works only intermittently upstairs or outside. A nice idea, but I wish I'd bought another of the old ""sounds and lights"", which after 5 years, still works well. Fisher Price was willing to send a second unit to see if the ""speaker"" was bad that came with the wearable monitor, yet even the new one they sent made the clicking sound. Now, one of them doesn't produce any sound at all (though it still lights up)."
1,Beware the random beeping,"We received this as a gift and it has worked ok. As others have started there there is a large amount of crackling and popping that goes on, but we sleep with a fan on so we haven't been too bothered by it. The thing we can't stand and the reason we're looking for a new one is that it just starts beeping at random. Just a loud rapid beep that is only silenced when you push on of the buttons. It happens completely at random whether it's on the charger or off.My advice would be to keep looking and avoid this monitor."
1,Great idea-if it worked.,"Thought this product was a great idea for Moms/Dads on the move but it simply doesn't work. I live in an apartment and have the standard Fisher Price Sounds n' Lights monitor which has worked perfectly for us for 2.5 years. I bought this for our second baby due in October and tested it out today. After a full charge, I wore the monitor bracelet in our bedroom and immediately began hearing lots of static and a popping noise, followed by loud beeps that drove me nuts. The rooms are not more than 50 feet from each other. Sadly returning this product and will continue to search for something that works for us."
1,Complete waste of precious money,"The very first thing we noticed was the severe popping and crackling noises the monitor made. We live in a single floor house, and the baby's room is less than 20 feet from our room, so I have no idea why it did this. It was hard to hear the baby over the crackling and popping sounds.Second we noticed that the volume settings were a joke - unless it is on the highest setting or there is complete silence, we couldn't hear the baby screaming.Third, the incredibly obnoxious and very loud beeping noise the monitor would make even when on the charger base. We tried turning the receiver on and off, recharging it, even tried unplugging the base unit in the baby's room. After 4 nights, the unit wouldn't stop beeping at all. Every time we turned it on, it would just start beeping. I [..]"
1,UNRELIABLE,I woke up to a hysterical baby because he had been screaming (for who knows how long) I am a heavy sleeper and rely on my monitor to wake me up when the baby cries... This monitor turned off in the middle of the night and completely stopped working after a month of use. Its the right idea (portable and small) if only it worked!!!
1,not impressed,"I was so disappointed with this monitor. I had been looking for something like this but unfortunately it just doesn't work. After trying for what seemed like forever to get the thing to work when I opened the box (I had to reset it), it clicks all the time, the low battery beep goes off even when it has been sitting in the charger, and the range is not what I had hoped for. If the monitor is on our second floor, I can't take it outside and hear if my baby has woken up. This is my third child and I sadly prefer the old school style monitor. Hopefully Fisher Price will read these comments and make some adjustments because it was a fantastic idea."
4,continuous interest without the interuption of mindless advertising,"I watched lost I and was itching to see LostII and feel just as strongly about viewing III,but the only way I can imagine thoroughly enjoying this program is sans the commercials.The acting is refreshingly good,especially since it's stars are not the usual household names.I can appreciate the opportunity for the writers to be able to extend the story for as long as it takes to disect each and every survivors life.As long as the story-line remains in the realm of reality-I shall be a fan."
3,Lost Season 3,"Originally didn't get the product that I asked for, but when I notified the seller, they sent the me the correct purchase. Repaid my postage for returning the other item."
5,Lost - Year Two,I was very impressed with the prompt response of the order and delivery departments at Amazon. They give new meaning to the concept of Team Work.It was a pleasure to deal with the team
3,She sucks,Not as good as Season 1. The Anna Lucia character is just awful and a complete turnoff to the show
5,Lost - When is Series 3 on DVD?,"Great series, very entertaining. Can't wait until next series is available."
5,Amazing season,"Season 2 of Lost was on par, if not a little superior to the first season. I'm not sure why everyone is complaining. If they answered the questions your whineing about, there would be no show. The mystery, and trying to fit the peices together is part of the beauty of Lost. This season advances the plot, in a more mature fashion than the first season; it takes 3 or 4 good episodes to lay the ground work for 1 or 2 episodes that paid off huge. What we learn about the drug plane, hatch, others, Claire, Island's healing powers, how they got there, what Kate did, etc. was great. This is probably the best written show on TV (that isn't Scrubs). I highly recommend this set."
5,Love this show,"Great to own the season since when it's on TV, they tend to put too much time between episodes, or do a lot of repeats. This is the best way to watch a season! Great show....plays with your mind a lot!"
5,Just keeps getting better,This second season is still more mysterious than the first. It immerses you deeper and deeper into the lives of the survivors and the mysteries of the island itself. At first I was getting a little anxious because every week it's a new mystery or something new but that is what makes it a great series.
4,Wait a cotton pickin friggin minute here!!!,I do not know why they do a show and then make it real befcause that is keepoign it real all right. I did realize Kate was pregnant with Jack's child but why would he still not protect her from the Carter guy? And Walt is such a whiner but wuddya expect from a kid playing xbox most his life haha ..huh huh huh.
5,Finally A show worth watching,FINALLY says most lost fans. This is an exciting show with twists and turns every week. They are deffinatly worth watching over and over. For every LOST fan this is a must have. 8 hours and more of special features is worth it. There are a lot of characters in lost and when you watch it you feel like you personaly get to know them. Every episode is exciting and will keep you at the edge of yopur seat. This is a must buy I am definatly buying it. Make a good choice and you should too.
3,Thought It Would be Better,The second year was not as good as the first year. Less suspense and on occassion I had to fight off sleep. I hope year 3 will be better.
4,lost II was great,"Loved it! much better than the first season...many new characters, and was very suspenseful..."
5,Amazing,This series of Lost is just as addictive as the first series. i can't stop watching it!!! Can't wait for the next series...
5,Lost Season 2,"Season 2 of Lost just further confirms to me that Lost is one of the best, most original shows to come along in a long time. The episodes themselves are great, and the bonus features help answer (at least to some degree) some of the questions and plot twists that abound on this show. Well worth the money."
4,Lost - again,"After the smashing and surprising success of the first season, the second season takes off (with a good head start) where the first one ended. The bonus material is very extensive and very good, especially the deleted scenes, but that is a personal favourite of mine anyway.I rate this product four stars (of five), not because of any of the bonus features or the quality, but simply because where the first season was great from start to finish, the second has some scenes that are just a little borderline credibility-wise. But if you loved the first season, you have to watch the second!"
5,lost,"great shows, I never get enough of it. you will watch this season more then once and see something new each time."
5,Lost in lost again!,"After watching the first season, I continued right through the second season. What a way to spend Christmas break. The best part is NO COMERCIALS!!!!!"
5,Twists keep on coming,"A very good follow up to the first season. Season had one of the most shocking twists and moves on tv. A show that kept you guessing and wantuing more. A big betrayal happens to our main players. You learn more about Jack, Sawyer, Kate and the other surviors of the plane crash. More Flashbacks, Smoke monters and you meet some of the Others( people who are on the island that are taking them out) . This was a very good show. A must watch"
2,Blu dissapointment,"Lost is great. I have seen every episode and love watching it all again. BUT, I hate the bluray disc. Disc one has 15 minutes of ads that cannot be ff. If you only watch one episode at a time you have to go thru each time. Getting to the menu is a problem and you have to remember which ep you saw last. There is no list for all the episodes included in the jacket. Season Play does not work at all. Now that I know that I can watch from Netflix this will be my last Blu ray TV program."
5,The Most Thrilling show,Its just an amazing series and I and my wife were hooked on it for severel weeks before we caught up with season three.Its best to watch it on DVD because it maintains the flow and thats what makes LOST so interesting
1,sucker!,"After watching this series I felt like I was a monkey with the producers holding a banana on the end of a stick. Ultimately the story line is pointless, meandering, without any cohesive vision. Just a series of ridiculous scenes following each other making one yearn for some ultimate meaning, which never surfaces, until you realize the real reason these people are on the island: to suck the brain cells out of your head and the money out of your wallet."
4,Lost Still Has It,"While season one was definitely cutting edge, and probably more consistently exciting than this year, season two advanced the plot, answered questions, intrigued its audience, and inspired an online reality game. The beginning and end of season two are especially riveting, though the middle of the season was a bit slow in places. Season one and two are entirely different in what they try to capture and explain. Season three, according to the show's creators, will stray from season one's mystery and season two's mythology, to explore ""the Others"" and romantic relationships. The DVD comes out a month before season three's TV premiere... catch up with all the Hanso goings-on before ABC unleashes the next round of episodes."
5,This show is great,"You have to start with season one, but you will love this show. Lots of twists, turns and surprises. Be warned though, you may stay up all night!"
5,Great continuing episodes,"While nobody would expect this to be a serious study of what would happen to a group of survivors stranded on a remote island, the writing of ""Lost"" is superb. Somehow, the most far-fetched, psuedo-science fiction story lines survive because the writers constantly surprise us with completely unexpected twists. As soon as you might think you know what is happening to the survivors or to one person, there is a complete shock or plot-twist making you re-examine what you think is happening. With both spiritual & psuedo-paganist themes, this is a highly interesting series, and a superb examination of human-nature & character study. Just as you can't ever be sure of the plot lines, it is also a credit to writers of ""Lost"" that people whom you might be inclined to judge early, turn out to show inner complexities and mixes of nobility & flaws. Very highly recommended."
4,Great Series,"The DVD is relatively good quality. I have not spent much time on the Special features, as realistically they do not want to give anything away.The series is becoming more and more like a comic book but it I still find it very intriguing. I chewed up the whole 6 DVD episodes in 3 weeks."
1,no show...,can't say anything cause the product didnt show up yet...............which is quit unheard of I think..
2,Not nearly close to the first season,"I don't understand how many people have become addicted to this show. I liked season one very much but I just stopped watching in the end of the season. Why? I couldn't care less about what was happening or about the characters. The writers even managed to turn interesting characters like Swayer and Locke into dull material. I couldn't care less about the others either. For example I hated Charlie, Micheal or Yim so I coulnd't stand an entire chapter (hour ) devoted to flashbacks of any of them. Good job writers in ruining a good show you clearly showed us no respect in not having any clue where the story nor the characters are going."
5,Very Nice,"Great set of season 2, I enjoy this one alot more then the first set. Don't get me wrong the first is great too, but so much has happened since season 1. Which makes this more fun to watch. I can't wait till season 3 comes out to dvd."
4,Lost Season 2 came in perfect condition!,I appreciate the speedy delivery and great condition the Blu-Ray disks came in. Will do business again!
2,Left leaning message,I wanted to re-watch and see what I may have missed the first time. Sense November 2010 I turned off TV and have opened my eye's to the message behind all the programs. Boy have I learned. Stop watching could not take it anymore.
5,Excellent!!,Product arrived quickly and in the shape promised. I highly recommend this seller to anyone!!
3,DVD technical problems,"For some reason the copies of this season I got from Netflix default to showing the English captions. Even though it's set to None on the menu, the captions appear unless I select None myself for every single episode. Very annoying.The content itself is very cheesy but of course it's addictive, so I guess I'm stuck with it."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Caught half a new episode by accident and it's reminded me how unwatchable the show is and maybe enabled me to better articulate why.My major beef with Lost is the overuse of one-shots. Almost every time someone is speaking no-one else's face is allowed in the shot so it creates the effect of just one person talking to the camera. You never see the other participant in a conversation reacting while someone is speaking, like whether they're rolling their eyes or nodding or whatever, so it doesn't feel like a conversation. The directors apparently think their audience is too stupid to follow two characters emoting/acting at once.Also the sets and especially the ambient noise give such a fake sterile atmosphere.And the fact that the writing is so dull, plots are so slow, and characters have no personality."
2,"Too many questions, not enough answers","I'm sorry to say that this show has been spiraling downward this past season. I was a pretty big fan of the first though. In the second, there are so many new mysteries that's it's hard to keep track, and almost no answers to any of them. I found myself getting so confused that I just stopped watching entire episodes towards then end. And let me tell you something, if you miss an episode, you'll be lost yourself. I have to say, it was a great idea, but if they don't start answering the questiosn that they throw at veiwes, they're going to burn."
1,Twin Peaks all over again,"This show had great promise in the first season, but season two it tried to milk the fan base loyalty too much and ended up going off the deep end. Not only was season 2 slow, but the injection of fantastic and mystical explanations threw it beyond the realm of Twin Peaks' daydream sequences. Better writers could have saved this show."
3,Why is it Ok for Hollywood to attack Christianity?,"I love lost, the writting is good and the casting is great. I liked the character of Eccho introduced this season. In the 3rd disc when hes explaining Baptism to Claire he says Jesus had to be ""Baptised by John the Baptist to forgive the man's sin"".This attacks the very core of Christianity as we believe Jesus was sinless, not to mention that the Bible does not say that. If this episode had been done to attack any other religion the outrage would have been endless."
3,Not as good as the First!,"In the beginning I was as crazy as everyone still is about Lost. Lost is a good show but season 2 makes me question if I still want to watch the show at all. Some things this season dose makes me ether board or crazy. What makes me crazy is the story, I love the story because of the others, darma, the numbers, the hatch, and the MONSTER!!!! What bores me is the fact that theirs no more survival. The survivors now have a shower, food, tolit paper, beds, and more food. And that annoys me a lot!! But the story and the mystery still makes me want more of that life sucking show!"
5,Lost Season 2,The DVD was great. It arrived when promised and everybody kept their agreement. Thank you for a doing a great business.
5,Lost,"It's nice having the entire season in one place! We've already shared it with several ""Lost"" fans."
2,A real let down,"LOST basically is a show about a lot of people doing stupid decisions ALL THE TIME! In the first season, that was funny. In the second season ,it became clear that the real intention of the producers is really to annoy us, not to entertain us, and keep going as long as this thing sells. The moment Michael shot the two girls (instead of confessing to Jack, or Locke, or Kate the real situation the ""Other s had put him through), this show ended for me."
2,I am so over Lost.,"Lost was such a breakthrough series last year and everyone here in New Zealand was watching it, it was in the top 5 highest rated shows and everything. Then Season 2 came. It was terrible. No plot advances just more questions and very little answers. They are really dragging this out to death. Now since about half way of season 2 Lost isnt even in the Top 15 rates shows. Everyone is over Lost. I watched Season 2 on and off to see if anything had changed and nope! nothing! The Season finale was also very underwhelming. I was upset that Desperate Housewives didn't get any Emmy nominations because on a level, they kind of deserved some nominations. But LOST! I am EXTATIC that it got no Emmy nominations because this can tell the makers of the show to pick up the pace and start answering more questions. Season 2 of Lost for me.....was definitley a sophomore slump."
2,GOING DOWN HILL BIG TIME!!!!!!!,The first season was amazing. It had twists and turns that were always great. In this season the twists and turns don't answer anything important. It gets dull toward the middle of the season. I love how the inhabitants on the island don't ever question why there are polar bears on the island(what ever happened to them anyway?) oh yeah and that smoke monster that tries to kill the survivors on a couple of occasions. Common the writers are running out of story and they can't keep up with answering all of the mysteries they reveal. I WOULD ANSWER ABOUT 6 OR 7 MYSTERIES BEFORE I START NINE OTHERS!!
3,Second Season Lag,"Lost's second season was not BAD. It simply wasn't up to par with the first. The story was too convolted, and the new characters were not nearly as effective as the originals.J.J Abrams left to work on a film career, and it was evident.The constant killing of characters for shock value resulted in a weaker cast, and the ratings are now showing it.This DVD will be worth purchasing for only the most hard-core of fans... season 1 is a nessecity. Hopefully, the show gets back on track for it's third season, because I know they have the potential... although, once again, J.J won't be around."
2,Sorry casting!,"Almost a reality show in that in an effort to maximize profits, the producers hired the cheapest aka: poorest actors available. The real killer of this show is the shaggy obese guy gets bigger each episode, he must be cannibalizing his costars! Remember after all those years on Gilligan's Island the Skipper never lost a pound!"
3,Season 2,"Lost season one was amazing... after that season I was a bit let down. It never seems like any of the answers are coming. As a matter of fact, there are just more questions. It is still mindly entertaing, but more annoying than anything. I truely the show will get canceled before anything is solved and I would forever be left to ponder the answers... I couldnt handle that, haha. So If you have never seen season 2, dont start it. If you enjoyed season 2 on tv more power too you and buy it. My advice. Greys Anatomy is the best show on TV."
5,Great!!!,"Well, not much to say. If you saw the first season and you liked it you cannot miss the second part of this serie."
5,Amazing Season 2,"Lost season 2 picks right up where the first season left off. You meet new and interesting characters as well as more mysteries. I'm working my way through the 3rd season now, but the second season is when the action and plot pick up and thicken! I highly recommend this season for any fan!"
5,Best show out there,"Honestly, this show has everything a viewer would want. But most importantly, the acting, which i think is essential in selling a show, is pretty darn good here, from everyone. I truly am hooked, and have never felt this way about any other show before. Addicted cant even describe it. It is the best hour of tv out there and nobody is allowed to disturb me while I am watching it."
5,Lost - The Complete Second Season,"LOVED IT!!! The special features and commentary are superb, and make the whole expieriance so much more intense! Get it if you want to know everything you want to know about Lost."
1,"Maybe I'm crazy, but....","I just don't like it!!! I tried it on my neck and I just couldn't get it adjusted to feel good. Adjusting is not easy...you have to get up and figure out where the thingy is and it's frustrating. The massage heads are HARD and not cushioned well at all and after a while it's just irritating. The noise...oh yeah...that's very relaxing...GRRRRR GRRRRRR!!!!!I bought it for my husband (OK...it was a selfish gift), but he couldn't stand it and I swore I'd prove to him how great it was...well...I couldn't do it!So, there it sits and sits and sits...til the day I throw it in the give-away pile.Save your money!"
1,Not pleasantly surprised..,"I got this for my husband (to share with me, of course) since the other customer reviews were favorable and said this massager worked well. I've tried it out a few times and it just never felt that great. The massager heads feel like bulbous HARD plastic things covered with a thin fabric, that rotate around in circles. They are adjustable, but whatever I tried, they felt very rigid on the body and I could never get them in a position so that they actually massaged my muscles. It was really just a frustrating experience, hoping for some massage action that gave even a bit of relief, but never getting much of any positive effect. There is also a prominent mechanical noise that is not conducive to relaxation. The massager is now spending its time sitting on the floor next to the chair where I can feel a twang of buyer's remorse when I see it."
3,it's ok,"I use this massager attached to a chair for my lower back.I wish it was stronger, the massager slows down when I press hard enough to make it effective.But it's not bad for my neck."
2,not impressed,"I purchased this product for my Manchester Toy Terrier. I thought that it was great to finally find these pj's. But when I started to use the product, I started to notice that the seams were coming apart on the front legs along with the rear. I have had to sew them."
5,Fits perfect,It took 5 minutes to put in new one. I feel the price is high for such a part that should last longer. This is the second operator to fail in 3 years. Anderson windows are top notch though.
4,Replacement Soap Dispensers,"We had a fire in our office and the contractor used the old soap dispensers. Some of them leaked, and finding like product was easier than we thought. They are fairly priced and they match the others we have. Thank you"
3,"Good idea, directions would be nice","The tool came in a nice little plastic case which was nice since it has some sharp edges. However, It would've been nice if the item was labeled on what each thing was or if it could come with a 'cheat sheet'. I wanted to give these as stocking stuffers for the men in the family and I had purchased a month or two in advance so when it came around for them to open I couldn't tell them what did what."
5,Cool item,"Finally arrived and it's really cool. Comes from overseas, so it took a lot longer than I expected. Worth the wait. Thanks for a cool product."
2,Caution,"Such ""credit card"" survival kits are good, but they carry one caution: Don't try to take them through an airport. Forgetting I had it, I did. Once. The saw and other such portions didn't make it through security. I didn't own this product, but one similar to it. Maybe this one would be allowed. However, best leave it home before trying to fly to Aunt Sue's for the holidays."
4,Worth having.,"You may look at this product and think its silly, but I say why not? I like to be prepared for any situation, but I don't carry my a backpack full of tools around with me everywhere. At least if something happens when I am on the road, or anywhere else, Ill have one useful tool always with me. Its also handy for those occasions where you get stuck with a beer that needs a bottle opener with none in sight."
1,very disappointing!,"There is no knife edge! That area of the product is so thick it could NEVER be honed to a cutting edge! I've bought this product before, but from Think Geek. It was nice and slim, and (among other things)had a good, useable blade. (The TSA was well justified to confiscate it when I forgot to put it in my checked luggage.)I was looking to replace the confiscated unit...and received this....trash! Yes, It was less expensive - but only by $3-$4...!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS if you want a blade that can cut anything...even thread, etc."
3,Bought it as a filler for free shipping,"I purchased this to save me a few bucks on shipping with Amazons, over $25 ships free. Of course the item I bought was $24.95. So to save about $10 on shipping I got this little tool. I am not sure I would put this in the survival tool category. I put this in the bottom of my First aid/survival pouch and forgot about it. I was out fishing and one of the nuts on my reel started coming loose. I attempted to tighten it with my forceps, which did not work. I was digging around to try to find anything that would work and found my ""classic survival tool"" and was able to tighten the nut, and continue fishing. So What I considered useless, turn out to save the rest of my day fishing. So in that it was worth the $2 bucks I spent on it. But trust me, this is not a survival tool. If I have to survive with just this tool, I would be a bag of bones drying in the wind. But if you need a filler item, This one is worth the 2 bucks."
3,Well...,"I purchased these to give as stocking stuffers. They seem nice and heavy, with several holes to use as tools, saw, knife, etc. The only problem is there is NO indication as to what all the tools are for. The sheet numbers the tools, but the supposed instruction sheet is in Chinese or Korean, or whatever. NOT so helpful. Maybe the guys I'm giving the gift to will be able to figure them out.I certainly would have wanted some detailed use *instructions.*then again, do men READ the instructions?"
3,it was ok for the cash,it was nice for the price it is a cute gift for someone but it really doesnt do anything worth nuthin
4,great little Knick nack,"I was impressed with the over all quality. The tool was a little smaller that I thought. However everything on this too works great,it s great for a spare bottle opener."
3,Received,"This is the smallest tool I have ever seen in my life, its going to be a stocking stuffer. Hopefully it doesn't get lost in the toe."
4,Satisfied,Gave to my wife so she can keep it in her car. Another of those purchases that if needed will probably be greatbut how does one know if there has not been a need for it.
4,"Good, and practical","Very sturdy, heavy object for its size. My favorite is the serrated edge and straight edge. You can stow it in a closed billfold and have it handy for any small job.. Recommend it."
3,Average offering,"This album was decent, probably worth picking up if you're a fan of the Geto Boys. Though with so many guest rappers on the album you can hardly call this a Geto Boys release. Though it doesn't even come close to touching their older albums. If you're looking for something that sounds like Grip It, or We Can't be Stopped, sadly this isn't it. If you haven't heard those other two albums, get those instead."
2,Chris Rock is hilarious but this DVD isn't,"I personally believe Chris Rock is the funniest comedian ever. I purchase both Vol1 & Vol2 of ""the Best of the Chris Rock Show"". The 2nd DVD deserves 4.5 out of 5 stars, without a doubt but the first volumne is pale in quality, length & content.This seems to just be grabs of random pieces of his show and are bar far NOT ""the best off"". The 2nd volumne has 55mins of skits and then another 45mins of his ""Taxi Cab Driver Confessions"" which alone almost makes the disk worth the purchase. This disk is just a poor collection of skits from the show, then 2 skits from the Taxi Cab. If you want a good Chris Rock DVD, buy volumne 2, but pass this one up, its not worth it, not even with a less than (...) pricetag."
5,"""The Best Of Chris Rock Show"" is a Best Buy !!!","Chris Rock and his cast on the show are extremely funny. I watch this DVD almost every other day. Everyone in my family just dies with laughter. This DVD features great classic skits from the early years of the ever popular HBO hit t.v. show. Everytime I think about this DVD,I can't help but laugh while I pop it in the DVD player to watch the show again. Buy this DVD, its well worth it. And the price is also another reason why this ""Best Of Chris Rock Show is a best buy. How can you go wrong this is Chris Rock, buy it- buy it- buy it."
4,Brilliant comedian,Rock is great at most of his material and this one is no different. He has a command of the subject he chooses and is right up there with Richard Pryor in his biting wit.
2,Snoozer,"Don't buy this expecting anything near as good as his HBO specials. The material here is about average for the Chris Rock Show... but even their selection criteria confuses me, as there have been numerous hilarious segments of the show they didn't select, and the ones they did select are (to me) by no means the best.I'd rate it as good as a random 1hr sampling of the show itself. Save your money and watch two episodes."
2,Not as funny as you might guess,"Though I'd never seen the show, I ordered volume 2 because Chris Rock is the funniest man in the world. I was really disappointed. It's nothing like his stand-up. It's just a not-great sketch show. I laugh more during any given episode of SNL. The taxi cab confessions stuff is pretty good. Not worth owning."
5,A must see!,"Chris only gets better as time passes by, this is Chris Rock at his best....Chris Rock is the bomb!"
5,Holocaust for Educators,This book is extraordinary! It was extremely useful to me as an educator in teaching a unit on the Holocaust. It was also extremely useful to me with my graduate studies. It is a wonderful source for educators.
3,Good but has many historical errors and distortions.,"Good referance book on 20th century anti-semitism, however has many historical inaccuracies and outright distortions, such as page 21 stating ""Christians forbade marriage between Christians and Jews"". Am I missing something? Jewish law FORBIDES intermarriage, EVEN today!! Why try to cover that fact just to bash Christians when Jews are the first to FORBIDE ANY intermarriage? Just Curious. Has a caption stating that Phillip the 5th of France ordered the death of an un-named Jewish woman, yet the full page drawing at the begining of the book depicts a friar sending her to her death surrounded by crucifixes. Again, why the anti Christian/Catholic distortions and outright lies? Who was it? A friar or the King of France? VERY MANIPULATIVE! Insults intelligence. Apparently ""historical revisionism"" can sadly run both ways. It hurts facts which are bad enough and left alone, carry there own weight of truth. Leave out the agendas and stick to the facts."
5,Breathe with Me....,"Well! where to start. This album is just beautiful and has unforgettable songs. This musician has a vivid imagination for making such a beautiful music. Haunting keyboards melodied mixed with beautful female voices and nice pop ryhtms. All tracks are beautiful. Breathe starts and ends in styles. Breathe is about journey of love, lost love, inspiration and searching love, anf found love. It is journey of desire of heart and passion of the soul. Beautiful piano melodies along with dreamy and ambient touch which will take ur pain away and heal u up. Beautiful ambient songs with some magical and inspiration touch. Buy the Breathe and experience the journey."
4,MESMERIZING,"what a truly fresh breath of sound - this is hauntingly beautiful, captivating - excellent disk to put on to drift off to sleep.... will definitely be watching for more from this group; if this is a first time attempt, cannot wait to see what some practice turns out next! highly recommend - not perfect but darn near!"
4,Relaxing at home treatment...,"This whole unit is excellent for the price. The foot bath works well though I can't say much about the heating element. It may maintain the water temperature but it will NOT heat up the water.The facial brush unit really gives one a good scrub and clean. It comes with a brush, a roller unit for massage and a sponge. It requires batteries. The facial sauna unit works very well and heats up quickly enough and has timer options.The manicure/pedicure unit comes with a charging base and dryer. Can be connected to a power source in addition to using it battery charged. I would have liked detailed description on how to use every tool in the pedicure case. That is missing. I guess I will have to get a professional pedicure with this unit to figure out what to use each for.On the whole the unit is very useful and worthwhile for the price."
2,"Good Product, Cheap Construction","While the kids love the product, one of the brush heads broke in the first week and the second shortly thereafter. Finding replacement heads in this area has been impossible."
4,Doesn't disappoint,"I recently discovered Cindy Gerard and found her first two Bodyguard Series books at a half-price bookstore. I read through To the Edge so fast, I couldn't wait to read this second book in her series. It didn't disappoint. I loved both Mac and Eve as well as the secondary characters. If I must have a small complaint, it would be the anticipated conversation where Eve would tell Mac about the baby she lost. It was mentioned several times in the book and seemed like a rather important part of their past. I couldn't wait to read the conversation where she told him. I envisioned an emotional, passionate, intimate conversation that just didn't happen. It was more or less an afterthought to tie up the loose ends. I would've given this review a 5-star if not for that."
3,ok - not the greatest.,I love the thought of having some super hunky hot bodyguard keeping me safe and satisfied at the same time. This book was good but i just could not warm up to it. Maybe it's because i read to many paranormal books and the reality books just don't work for me anymore. I found the reasoning for needing a bodyguard weak. The suspense was just not worth it. I have read all five books in the series and would not do it again. I bought them on line all at the same time and wish i wouldn't have. I recommend that anyone who is interested to try the half price book store first before investing a lot of money in these.
3,"Great main character (Eve), nice plot",I really like Eve. She was introduced in book 1 and is Nolan's twin. Some of the character traits mentioned in book 1 are gone in this book. I really liked her interaction with Tyler at first. But 3/4 of the way through it was hard to stay interested in their love story. The action was awesome though. Quick and easy read.
4,The Best,"Just started reading Cindy Gerard's Books. They are well written, as well as suspenseful. She keeps you engrossed from beginning to end."
3,Okay,"I usually don't read 'former lovers meeting again' books especially when it ends badly because there is always the need to go over and over the past. But with this book I did not have to tell the characters to get over it the past or walk away. I liked Eve a lot, she had style, guts, and confidence, especially when dealing with her love interest, like when she's beating him to a lead. The sex and love making was very hot, and I found myself relating to both Eve and the secondary female character, Tiffany, who had a great story. Both Mac and Tiffany have made mistakes in the past, but they both try to improve, with great character developing."
3,Really wanted to like it,I have used this product for about two 1/2 weeks now. I like the smell but it started breaking my face out. I have eczema so I'm not sure what ingredient caused the break out. I'll have to stop using it.
3,nothing like the real thing,This is a ok massager for those little problems. But when you have major ones theres nothing like a substitute for the real thing.
3,Homedics personal massager,"I have had 2 of these and while they work well I have had a problem with the cord,both of them become either loose or have a short in them and that's it,they no longer work."
1,Don't buy it!!!,I owned the same model before. It worked well for two years. I bought another one (same model) but it wasn't the same. It is lighter and not as powerful. It broke down after 5 months of use. I'm trying to figure out what to do with it.
2,NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,The vibrator has to be active for the heat to work. If you want to use it while it is hot it has to be set aside vibrating while it heats up. The two contact points are too far apart. When trying to massage a specific area you end up massaging something else - like a bone for instance.
4,Good product,"I bought this massager for some upper back pain I'd been experiencing. I was a little skeptical about this product because it's so much cheaper than other ones I've seen just like it (ie Brookstone products) but I must say.. it works great! It helped to get all the knots out of my back and it wasn't too heavy for me to use on my own, although I'm sure it works even better if you have someone else holding it for you. This is a great deal, if you're debating about whether or not you should buy this product debate no more... BUY IT!"
3,HoMedics Massager,"This massager is pretty good overall. The variable speeds are great, although you have to work up to the high speed. It can be a bit strong if you start out with it. The massager is heavy, though, so your arm and hands may get tired after a few minutes. A great thing about this is that you can change how far apart the massaging nodules are, depending on how you like it or what area of your body you are massaging. Note: The instructions say that it should not be used for more than 15 minutes at a time. This massager could stand to be a little lighter, but I think it is worth the price."
1,Horrible!,I hate this new model. It has almost NO POWER compared to the old version. When they made the heads adjustable they changed the power of the motor or something and it's worthless. I wish they would start making the old model again. It was awesome!!!!!!! It had tons of power and you really got a good massage. It was more like a professional model. Don't buy this one. Save your money and hope they come back with the old model. Anyone giving this product a good review must work for the company.
4,Effective but large.,"This is an effective massager but is quite large, heavy and somewhat awkward to use. No regrets about buying it."
4,Works fine,"This product works fine, actually better than any other store bought massager I have used. The only downside is that it is heavy- Although when I massage my own back while laying down, the weight makes it much easier and more effective."
2,Beware: Consistently defective design,"Although this product works quite well initially, the electrical cord will short out at the base of the unit after a year (or less) of normal use. Scroll through the reviews, and it's obvious that others have experienced this too.This occurred a few months after the warranty ran out. Thinking it may have been a manufacturing anomaly, I purchased another one.The exact same problem happened on the second massager, this time literally a few days after the warranty ran out.I wrote to Homedics, providing receipts for both purchases and explaining the circumstances, and they didn't even have the courtesy to acknowledge the correspondence."
1,"Overheats easily, internals melted","When the warning says ""No more then 10 minutes of continuous use"" they mean it. We didn't respect that, and the internal mechanisms melted and the thing died a slow horrible death. It's now landfill and it was only 1 year old...I'm off to find one with an automatic overheat shutoff..."
3,Better have a strong arm!,This massager certainly works well enough- but is really very heavy and awkward to hold. It does the job very well - with a variable speed which is nice. It is too bad it is so heavy and such an awkward shape. Makes it very difficult to hold on hard to reach places (like lower back and shoulders) for any length of time.
3,HoMedics massager,"I ordered this massager to replace a worn out HoMedics massager I have had for years. I was disappointed with the lack of power with the new model. I thought I was buying the same model I was replacing. Wrong, not near the power as the old one."
4,Massage,It's okay not nearly as good as my old model that was discontinued this one is much cheaper than my old one as well. Wish I had my old one working again.
1,"Estimated Delivery Date... ""Deceptive!""","I have owned several of these specific units over the years. I like the quality of the product; what I really dislike is an estimated ship time of a couple of days and it is taking over a month. If they had been more honest, I would have made the purchase else where... as I have in the past. Poor service the first time is the suppliers fault... If I put myself in that position in the future... it would be foolish on my part."
4,Kick your back and relax,"It's big, somewhat heavy, somewhat unwieldy, and the best hand held massager I've seen. This isn't one of those ""you know what"" shaped battery operated jobs. This delivers a real kick. It is a powerful percussive massager that can break up muscle tension like no other I've tried."
3,Good but not perfect,"This is a nice handheld massager. However, because of how heavy it is, you can't give yourself a massage (your arm ends up aching). This is only ideal if you have a another person who is willing to give you a massage. However, I have had no other real problems with the product itself."
2,"Not Strong Enough for me, good price though","I had to return this product despite of the good price (paid $29.99) because:1. not strong enough (the older model is stronger)2. too heavy3. too noisyBasically it didn't do what I wanted it to do.But it's pretty subjective.I read lots of good reviews about this, that's why I gave it a shot at the first place."
3,"I like it, LIKE IT, and LIKE THIS~!!!!","I have searched and searched and searched.......and FINALLY got me this one~! First impression was....CHEAP MADE LOOPKING. MADE IN USA? but when I turn it on, well, it worked as I expected. Very nice massager for its price, it comes with three adjustment caps for SOFT, MEDIUM, and HARD. I wish there were case/place where I can store these caps which were not in use. If you are not careful you could hardly loose them~!!! Also, I thought the machine was HEAVY. If you are doing it on to yourself, you may get tired of just holding it....(I am a men, wiegh 200lb, 6'2, work out every day). and I thought this machine was heavy to hold for more than 1 min. massage on to your self. So, I give 3 stars."
5,Heavy Handed Relief,"If you have used all those ""buzzing"" massagers, this one is the one that will actually get the kinks out. The two pressure points move back and forth at blazingly fast speed. When you put the head on your back you will finally feel those pains getting the relief they deserve. At $30 (at the time of this writing) this unit is worth every penny. As an added bonus, under the head there is a rubber button (that is sorta hidden) but when you press it the heads move from a close position to a wide position so that you can move from arms to legs or neck to back. It is REALLY heavy though, just like everyone else said, but that's because of the motor size, obviously. I have tried (owned) 5 different types of massagers and this one is one of my favorites. I don't know if spending an extra $30 bucks for heat or two more pressure points (the 4 point homedics one) is worth it. I think for the price, this is definately worth it. N-Joy!"
4,NIce Product,"This product works really well as my very own personal therapist. You notice the weight after using it for over five minutes. However, the results are wonderful. The roller ball spacing feature is handy. This product gives a comfortable massage; not like some units that have more vibrations and tickling (irritating) sensations."
4,massager was worth buying,"We bought this massager from amazon and got a good deal on it. My legs generally pain whenever I walk a lot...so when I used this massager it gave me a good varying speed variation with a width adjustment feature that helped me to press it precisely at the point of pain.So all in all, it helped me to relax."
5,"If you don't like this movie, you really have no imagination.(in my opinion)","It's hard for me to explain what my title is indicating but you really should approach this movie with an open mind; a mind of a ""WHAT IF?"" mentality. I loved it from start to end. The Alternate ending wasn't to get excited about and I'm glad they left it out the release. Overall, an awesome movie that I'm sure will be a classic."
1,Love the movie dont' buy the Blu Ray.,"The previews cannot be fast forwarded, skipped, proceed to top or main menu so if you stop the movie you have to sit through 9 minutes of previews before you get to the menu. This is a deal breaker. Let the Blu Ray MFGs (not it's not dirty but manufacturers) know this is not acceptable. A dead horse head in their bed should do."
1,BEWARE,The picture that is advertised is not the blue ray that you will recieve.. no digital copy / dvd .. will not do business with them again
2,brainless,This movie is so lame and dumb that I felt stupid for renting this. ROFL to those who said this is a thought-provoking or smart movie.
5,Amazon Instant Video SUCKS,Loved the movie. But HATE the Amazon Instant Vid. Why should a 1 hour 45 min movie take 2 hours and 10 min to watch???? Because Amazon Instant Vid kept stopping. Sick and tired of this system. I want my $3.99 back!!!
1,Beware of Fox bundles!,"Nowhere did I see in the product description that this BD would only play (forced) on region code A bluedisc players, so it will not play on a region code B player (like e.g. in Europe). This is the very first overseas BD which I could not play, BTW. The digital copy with DRM just for the PC is not a real compensation, since it lacks a) BD quality and b) BD goodies. And due to DRM it will only play in Windows Media Player or iTunes.In the meantime, I know from various forums that FOX is one of pretty few studios forcing this customer unfriendly BD regional code.So, customers from overseas: refrain from buying FOX media in the US if your player does not support the BD region code A.It will certainly influence my buying habits. No more FOX. Pity."
3,Limitless,I was disappointed in this movie. I expected more in the plot. It sort of dragged in the beginning and I was lost as to where it was headed.
4,Best movie of the year!,I loved this movie. It had a wonderful plot and of course Bradley Cooper is easy on the eyes! I love love the ending. Too cool. Would definitely recommend it.
4,Interesting concept . . .,"Fast-moving, good acting. Leaves you hanging about details of protagonist's final transition. Makes you wonder if we couldn't all use more of our brains on our own initiative!"
2,Used- but not in GOOD condition,"I got the movie in good time, about a week. At first viewing there were a few pixal issues half way thru the movie. The second time- MANY problems. Very disappointed in the quality. My email to the sender remains unanswered."
4,Aspect Ratio,"Its a good movie. And you get a different perspective when you see the alternate ending.However, These DVDs need to offer a different aspect Ratio for different buyers. Its annoying to have a NEW DVD in Blu Ray used on a wide screen TV and you STILL (STILL) get horizontal black bars on the screen. Some of us get the full picture with a 185:1 aspect ration. This one is delivered with a 240:1 aspect ratio."
4,limitless,This movie starts out kinda slow but if u stick with it ur really gonna like it.It is a little long but by the end ur gonna wish azt was a real drug.lol The only bad part to this mocie I can c is the horrible tupee they put Bradley Cooper in at the end of the movie.
2,Pretty dull movie,"This is an interesting concept with too many problems within. Here is a pill that makes you smart yet somehow Cooper always has problems! He didn't know he was out of pills until he grabed the last one. Never occured to him? He forgot to pay his loan shark back with his millions of dollars of profit? The worst of course, is that he successfully predicted a texting driver would crash into another car. Out of all ways and means to prove this guy is brilliant, the movie has to resort to complete random chance.Not to say it was terrible - it was entertaining but too many scenes threw me off. It's a problem to have a genius run into problems he could have easily avoided. The final scene is Cooper chewing down on De Niro when in fact that speech should be geared toward the audience, not some small character we don't care about and can't connect to. There were not enough connections to everyday events (people) to engage us.It's enjoyable but I wouldn't say go out of your way to see it."
2,"Disappointing, didnt finish it.","I love the actors in this, but couldn't finish the movie. I tried twice and each time got bored. I really wanted to like it, it sounded like a good idea, but wasn't very well done in my opinion."
4,"OK rent, not buy",This was an alright rent. Worth the hour and half to watch it. I would never own this though. Story line is ok and makes you wonder what YOU would do.
5,I love the concept,I know it is wish fulfilment as a short cut to success; but I loved the movie! I highly recommend it!
2,Faust denied,"I enjoyed watching this one, but found it a little dissatisfying, and the more I thought about it, the less satisfied I was (mostly about the script; the acting and camerawork were both excellent). My big problem with it, is that this is, in essence, a Faustian bargain tale. Such tales should not have a happy ending; it gives a moral of ""if it seems to good to be true, go for it. Maybe it won't be"". Not exactly either uplifting or properly cautionary."
3,"Not terrible, but not really good either","The cinematography for Limitless is great, but the story ultimately doesn't hold up its end of the bargain. Still, the acting is generally good and the storyline (although kind of dumb on reflection) kept my attention through to the end. It's a B movie, maybe a B+, but it's not a complete waste of time."
2,good idea but shallow exploration,"it pretty much sucked. the only evidence we have of his ""limitless thought"" is fighting and saying random stuff about the stock market."
2,waste of time,It is a poorly developed story that cannot make itself make sense. Film degrades into unneeded violence. Waste of time.
2,Rent or borrow- don't buy until you've seen it.,Every year I buy about 10 movies I've never seen and generally enjoy about 90% of them. This year my miss is LIMITLESS.While I really enjoyed the premise and thought the entire plot was well thought out this one missed me for in the execution. It's like the creative team felt they need to push the envelope in cinematic technique. I think the movie could have stood on it's own without that. THe acting is solid (though you can tell its as filmed quickly in some scenes). This movie could have been great and could have been a repeat watch in my household.Sad to say that I cannot recommend purchasing this movie. While I am certain that some people love it- don't purchase just because you've seen the previews and like the premise.
3,wanted the dvd copy with this,"too bad the dvd copy of the film was not included. overall the package arrived on time as expected. bla, bla, bla"
4,"Good new Concept, but with some plot holes","Who wouldn't like to be extremely smart? But being extremely smart also would mean that you would be able to easily outsmart a bunch of ignorant rough necks.Also being very smart would mean that you would know that discretion is the better part of valor. Unfortunately the smarts that they were given really wasn't all that limitless. Then on the down side there are the blackouts and the psychotic murderous behavior.The long and short of it is that these persons allowed greed I suppose to really cloud their judgment and then had to deal with the consequences.While this is an interesting film, it is really an oxymoron. But if it was written without these flaws, it then may not have been as interesting. Hence we are left with a limitless dilima. Watch the film and enjoy it , but don't think too hard about it."
2,Disappointed,"As much as I love Bradley Cooper, and he was his charming self........this movie just wasn't for me! Fell asleep!"
4,Love this movie,"It's a good movie, that's why I bought it. I only give it 4 stars because it had a couple scratches. It plays fine though"
3,Limited appeal,"A waste of a good idea. The chance meeting and the plot that follows are poorly developed. If this was better produced it would have been very entertaining. Perhaps someone else will get the story and make it a good movie. Meanwhile, you should pass this one by."
2,Did not keep me interested,Limitless had a lot of tempo changes that I found boring. The plot was pretty thin and did not keep me glued to the screen as most good thrillers will.
5,Year's best movie I have seen,THIS YEAR'S BEST MOVIE! A PLUS. THEY SHOULD MAKE A SEQUEL. I HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS MOVIES AND THIS ONE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN1` I WATCHED IT 3 TIMES IN 48 HOURS BECAUSE IT'S THE BOMB! CONRATULATIONS BRAD COOP. I DON'T EVEN LIKE HIM BUT HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB!
2,not that great,"this movie is about a man that is surrounded with failure, his work, his relationship with his girlfriend. and when he took this magic medicine that made his IQ 4 digits, things started to be clear and he can read books in few days and make a lot of money in short period, but things started to have unwanted detour......in short, I think the direction is not that great."
3,Fun to watch -- as long as you don't think.,"I found this movie to be somewhat entertaining, but certainly not spectacular. Of course, Bradley Cooper can make any movie entertaining just because he is gorgeous, but there were several things that were just so absurd, that it took the movie out of the awesome category and put it into the entertaining category; specifically the outcome of a police lineup, too many clumsy fingers, and a really absurd blood drinking incident.There were some nice twists in the movie, and I enjoyed those, and the ending was good, so it wasn't a total waste. It just wasn't great."
2,Don't do drugs!,"Do not show this movie to your children, it WILL encourage them to take drugs. Seriously, I am not sure what the moral of the story is! Waste of time and money..."
1,Soulless copout,"So disappointed--seemed like so many people gave this high marks. Bradley Cooper does a great job acting, but the rest is just some tiresome, and rather humdrum, absolutely non-mind-bending stuff. The part about him now being able to access 100% of his brain is actually a very small part of the movie--he gets smart, can do cool things, and things are looking up, and then....nothing. That's it. A little action, no twist, no nothing. The movie ends incredibly boringly and makes you feel like you went through all the rambling storytelling to get absolutely nowhere."
1,Limitless potential,"Limitless potential, terrible execution. Nothing noteworthy to write about, the movie has terrible screenplay and direction. The polt loses ground quickly though is the end is not to bad."
3,Same old Same old,"Good guy takes pill, Bad guys chase and try to kill good guy to get the pill, Good guy overcomes and is super smart and life is good. Typical Hollywood action movie formula, blah blah....Lets put it this way or use this for a yardstick, it was not a ""V for Vendetta screen play"" that really got you to think.I am glad I didn't plop 12 bucks at the movie theater for this movie."
1,Great Film For Disturbing Violence Junkies!,"I truly regret seeing Limitless! The violence is excessive and disturbing. PG-13 doesn't mean very much anymore! The current movie rating system in the United States is an absolute joke and it should be abolished! Have a sex/violence activity rating system that's practical! At least that kind of rating system would be much more honest! When stabbing out a man's eye and making him blind (he was already blind in the other eye) is PG-13, then what's next? Scraping an eye out with a spoon?See:War Junkie: One Man's Addiction to the Worst Places on EarthandThe Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History"
3,"Limitless has it's limits, but highly pushes them.","The plot of this movie is simple. A man takes pills that unlocks 80% of his brain that regular humans don't use. To me, it's a very catchy plot, because who doesn't want that? The story picks up right off the bat, and for the first 30 minutes or so, it moves quite nicely. However, it fall into a slump for about 40 minutes, where, to tell the truth, I was bored out of my mind, and was thinking about shutting it off. However, it redeems itself with an entertaining chase through the park, and a house robbery. All in all, it was ""OK"". 3 stars is good enough for this film"
3,Limited,"I thought the movie was just o.k.. I agree with other reviewers that the concept is terrific. Since I'm not an action movie junkie, the concept is what drew me in. I just have to say, for someone with ""limitless"" brain power, this guy made some pretty terrible decisions. Probably the best part of the movie was discussing what we would have done with limitless potential once the movie was over. Getting involved with a Russian psychopath mobster was not at the top of anyone's list!"
5,"Stylish, And Fun To Watch","I found this a stylish movie with an interesting premise that delivers more than it fails.Bradley Cooper, as ""Eddie Mora,"" was good in the lead and actually all the characters in the film were interesting. That includes the villains, who were credibly menacing.Anyone who has been hooked on any kind of pill can relate to this film. The pill in this story, however, is different from anything anyone's heard of....and intriguing. You can't help but wonder if you would be tempted to take it yourself.Co-starring with Cooper and his magic pill is the style of the film. It's very stylish and looks great on Blu-Ray. If you're into visuals, this is a good movie to check out. The same goes for fans of suspense.Would I would watch again? Yeah, the ending is a little contrived but, simply,it's a fun movie to watch."
3,As long as he can keep the money coming he can keep the girl,"Girl dumps boy for not living up to the potential she saw in him. Boy uses drug to not just live up to but surpass that potential. Complications follow. But really, money is the ultimate aphrodisiac so you know as long as he can keep the money coming he can keep the girl (plus a few bonus trysts along the way)."
1,awful! not even worth renting.,"first of all the storyline has no depth. it was underdeveloped, along with the characters; some scenes seem staged, and last but not least, it all came to an end so fast and simple-from a false advertising climax-that's worthless!don't see it, don't buy it! if you don't believe me, simply rent it. i just gave it one star just because i was told i'd be given a favor if i were to watch it with someone.just another crappy movie that came out of Hollywood's a*****e."
2,really?,"I dont write many reviews but Im bored and clicked on this so here goes. If you liked this movie you severely lack intelligence. It was an interesting idea but it was so predictable and poorly written. It seemed like a really good idea for a movie was given to a retard director and the result was ""limitless""."
4,Great Movie!,"This is such a terrific movie! It's fast paced, exciting, some parts will have you on the edge of your seat. First movie I've seen where Bradley Cooper played the lead. He's VERY good. Robert DeNiro has a great cameo. A really different type of story. Very cool. Highly recommend this film."
5,Good Movie,"Finally an original movie idea that could have a hint of truth behind it. I loved Limitless fast paced, good action, and get this a good story. I'm looking forward to watching it all over."
1,On-Line copy of Limitless,It appears I accidently order this. I did not want it at all! Before I knew it my account was charged. I meant to buy the DVD as a gift for someone who does not own a computer.
3,"Fun, although ultimately shallow, thrill ride","What would you do with a pill that gave you superhuman intelligence? Bring about world peace? Solve hunger or poverty? Teach your brilliant ideas to others? No, not if you are the hero of this movie. He goes for mere selfish sex, money, and power.I like a profound theme in my movies. This one could have been a profound and meaningful tale about a modern Faust or Icarus. But it chose a cheaper, more shallow path.True, this movie was fun thrill ride. which I enjoyed more via streaming because I could fast forward the sex and violence. I just wish it had chosen a more profound theme.This movie is about a lazy slacker who solves all his problems by taking a dangerous drug. I would have preferred that it had been about a lazy slacker to tries to solve all his problem by taking a dangerous drug but instead learns some wisdom, even some humility."
4,Pretty good,"A man takes a drug that gives him limitless power to achieve. Of course, it's the usual deal with the devil, so there's a downside, a huge one. He takes it as far as it will go, in the end. This one is entertaining."
4,A Orgianal Fun Thrill ride.,"A pill that allows you to use the full 100% of your brain is the very fun idea that Limitless mostly uses to make a fun thriller. The script is smart, but could have been a little more tight. The acting Bradly Cooper gives is very charming and smart. This movie truly felt like a ""Roller Coaster"" The directing is fast and pulls you straight in and dosent let you go till the last moment. The directing was the best part. In the moments he isn't using the pill the movie has a grimy bleak feel, but when he is on the pill its very lively and colorful. In the end the movie has great directing that showed me new and different things, acting that was good, and a script that while flawed keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a tighter script this could have been amazing, but its still a fun movie worth a look."
4,Intriguing story; thrills,"Cooper does a nice job in this story of a man who discovers a drug that will allow his mental capacity to expand considerably, making him a faster writer, a card counter at poker, and a very savvy financial guru whose talents unfortunately attract some bad guys who want a piece of what he has. They want the money and the drug, putting him and his loved ones at risk. You cannot help but root for this man, who was not successful before taking NZT, and who is relentlessly pursued by murderous villains until.....I don't want to wreck the ending for you!"
4,Excellent acting and direction,"I had not really heard much about this movie and was glad that I looked it up. No wonder it did well. The lead in this is excellent.I am not one to give a formal review, but if you read the synopsis, take that and add some intrigue, action and some excellent twists, you have it.Very good, watched it twice and would recommend to friends and family."
3,it's okay,"My little girl didn't care for the toys at all until she was about 4 months and, even now, she only plays with them for a few minutes. The flower music box in the center of the toy bar is big and I always worry about it hitting her on the head. She prefers sitting in it without the toy bar obstructing her view and I'm happy to oblige because I find the music a little too shrill!Baby sits in her bouncer when I have to get some chores done but it's not always easy. She has to be bounced up and down in it for her to really settle down and I find myself having to be right there doing it! Now that she's a little older, she sometimes likes bouncing herself. All in all, it's an okay bouncer...it certainly keeps her distracted for a few minutes per day...although I'd probably go with another bouncer for the next one!"
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I was in a hurry when I picked this out and was disappointed to find this bouncer has such a rigid stand it hardly bounces when you try to do it manually. Also because the metal stand sticks out you have to be careful not to catch your toes when you walk by it. All the FP bouncers' vibrate mode is useless to me so I remove the battery pack, which gets in the way of their feet anyway because the seat is not long enough. Also this one is not reclined enough and too deep. I felt her back was too hammocked and the pillow cushion should support under her neck and to the side so I modified mine (see photo of sleeping baby). What good is the cushion above her head when she's practically upright with her chin hanging down? I haven't had luck selling it yet."
4,Lovely Product,"My daughter is 5 months old and she is now adjusting to the bouncer. I had a rocker before, but it was too big and cumbersome. This item is easy to carry about and the colours are very girly. The little pillow adds extra comfort and Jordan uses the toy bar as a foot rest. Worth the price."
3,ok for the first few months,"My baby seems to like sitting in this bouncy chair as a safe alternative to laying flat. However, she is 5 months old and already seems to have outgrown the chair lengthwise. The whole chair is covered with pink fabric, and then the part at the foot of the chair is hard plastic and situated so that when she kicks her little feet, she is kicking this hard plastic part. I don't understand why Fisher Price developers didn't think ahead and spend the extra 4 cents on fabric to cover the top of the hard plastic part; however, perhaps Fisher Price marketing execs realized that if babies quickly outgrow the bouncy chair (before it's really necessary) parents will be likely to buy another similar item."
2,No so soothing,I bought this for my puppy who has severe anxiety in the car. I was hoping it would help ease some of her drooling and upset stomach/vomiting. She still continued to drool and has vomited while this was playing. The sound quality of this CD is horrible. The volume of each song is not consistent. I had to keep turning it up because it seemed that the sound level would drop with each new song. I don't think this is a tool that can help an animal with severe problems but it may help in calming one with milder ones.
5,Excellent Set For Different Size Tapcons,"This is an excellent item to go along with my Makita LXT211 drill set.The drill that comes in the set is also a hammer drill and not havingany hammer drill bits I chose this set. Saves me the trouble of havingto pick out a drill bit everytime I buy different size Tapcons. What alsomakes these bits great is that they are ""long"" shafted so your not smashingthe nose of your drill each time the the bit goes thru the cinder or concreteblock. Price was more than reasonable and delivery was fast. You cant gowrong with Bosch Blue Granite drill bits."
3,Location Free : different from the Slingbox,"To watch the home TV on a computer outside of the home, Slingbox is better. Changing channels is a lot easier on Slingmedia Player than with Location Free, and the Slingbox connection is a lot more consistent than Location Free.However, I love using Location Free with my portable PSP at home. It allows me to watch the news in bed, while my wife watches Lifetime on the flat screen. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and the small (bit excellent) screen of the PSP allows me to watch TV without waking up my wife."
3,"This does work outside of the house like coffee shops and anywhere theres an internet signal,but is a pain to setup!!!!!!!",First I thought this product can only work in the house but than I read the manual and it told me that I have to have a router that has upnp abilities or port forwarding. That is the only way you can connect to the base station through the internet. If you do not set your router up with upnp or port forwarding than you can only watch tv in your house through your own internet service only. I only spent $50 so I thought it was worth the money but I wouldn't spend more than that.
1,LocationLOCKED NOT LocationFree,Even though it can be a great product and easy to setup. It does NOT deliver. Works great within the house. Sony tech support can NOT make it work anywhere else. they do not know WHY or HOW to access it over the internet thus LocationLOCKED. Cannot recommend it unless if happy to use around the house ONLY!
3,Ruby & Diamond Bracelet,"I am returning the bracelet beacuse the latch is to hard to open, and the safety needs to be pryed open. If another bracelet same style)is available then I will exchange, if not the I would like a refund.Thank YouMark Edgar"
3,It's a microawave,"This is a very nice unit but it is not perfect. The carousel does not allow one to set things in the corners. This proves to be a problem when proofing bread. On cold days I often heat a quart of water to boiling and set it in the corner, then place my bread in to rise.The quick button is not as convenient as the one I have on my sharp unit. On the sharp microwave I just push the button and it turns on for a minute. On this unit I push the button for a minute then push start. The extra button push is engineered into the unit and is a pain. I do like the fact that the carousel plate can be removed and cleaned but keep in mind that it is 16"" in diameter and may NOT fit in your dishwasher. Despite the 1300 watt rating, it is not appreciably faster than my very old GE, nor my 900 watt Sharp."
5,A Powerful Description of the Immigrant Experience,"When I heard author An Na speak at a school librarian's convention in Portland, Oregon, in October, 2002, I knew I had to read this book. What she said struck a chord with me, an immigrant who came to this country when I was 3 years old from Holland in 1953. I am also very close to a young man who was adopted from Korea when he was 2 years old.While this powerful story is about a Korean girl adapting to her new life in America, many of the struggles she faces are similar to those that I went through, even though I was a white kid from an earlier generation.I plan to share this emotionally gripping story with my adopted Korean friend, as I believe he will find some things to relate to as well.Don't be put off by the awkward, slow start. That's part of the story's development. Highly recommended."
5,A moving first-person story,"Four year old Young Ju believes America must be heaven even though there are many adjustments to be made from life in Korea; but as she and her family face problems in the new world, they find both family life and traditions challenged. A moving first-person story of a young girl's struggles with change and a new culture."
3,A Step from Heaven,"A Step From HeavenThe plot of the story is about two girls who are traveling to Mi Gook which in Young Ju&#65533;s mind before they went to Mi Gook she called it heaven. Young Ju and her mother are getting ready to go to Mi Gook. When Young Ju and Uhmma get to Mi Gook Young Ju realizes that they are not in heaven when they are really I the southern part of California.I both liked and disliked A Step From Heaven, I liked this book because it was interesting to see such a difference in cultures and I disliked this book because it was hard to go along with what they were saying for instance they would be saying something about something and then start a whole other subject/ place.Mi Gook is Korean for America"
3,A New World,"young Ju, is entering a new world with an entirely different eniroment.... this new world is America, read young ju's story as she goes from chilhood into adult as the first generation from her family.read young ju's complicated and funny life story of how she coped with life in America and with the both happy and difficult times that she was brought to face."
5,It Gave Tears To My Eyes,A Step From Heaven was a pretty good book. Young Ju and her family immagrated to America. ... They have to learn English. Later as Young Ju grows up her father (aka Apa) gets meaner. He got drunk more often and skiped work. AT the end of the book Apa almost KILLS(!) Young Ju's Mom! Luckilly Young Ju calls 911 to save her Mom's life. That gave tears to my eyes. It must be really sad when someone in your family is an alcholic and hurts the other members of his or her family. But don't worry the end is happy. Even though I am 10 this book is sort of inapropriet for me 'cause there's sort of violence but I still read it. I would recomend this book for ages 11 and up.
1,Wasting time looking behind!,I am a Kent State student who had a chance to read this chapbook by j. gabriel scala. I can't say that I get it but I'm sure she is stuck about as far in the past as possible! The story wasn't too bad but maybe the author could use a good therapist? I'm tired of people always looking back and giving a good whine about it! Sorry to be harsh but the truth is the truth! Find a good piece to read that's uplifting rather than a real chance of depression!
2,Not very good,I was disappointed in this book. I was expecting a Red Dress Ink book a little different from the other ones I had read. This book jumps all over the place without being interesting in any one area. I think this novel wasn't really about anything in particular. I got quite annoyed with the character at times. It was pretty obvious that she had misjudged the character she was in love with and it was just a matter of getting to the end of the book to finally see them get together. I was glad to be done with this book and move on to another one. I think the first 5 pages are intriguing and from then on it goes downhill. I doubt I would recommend this book to anyone.
2,hmmm....,"While I love Jill Sobule, I have to say that this album does not express nearly as much passion and inspiration and inventiveness as her later albums.... Jill doesn't even acknowledge this album on her website, which has to say something about it. It sounds like mid-80s soft rock e-z listenin' stuff. Very synthetic and constructed.... but it was a first effort, a place to really find her feet, and she's absolutely breathtaking now."
2,"Good first effort, but get the later stuff","Jill Sobule really hit it big with her first hit ""I Kissed a Girl"", which is on her second self-titled album ""Jill Sobule"". This first album isn't really all that good; like she was still finding herself. For a better album, check out her ""Jill Sobule"" album or even better ""Happy Town""."
4,Nice,As described. Aimed toward religion but thats ok. For older people or conservative people. Its a good book and worth the money
1,Smothers people with xtian views,"When my grandad was dying, he received this book as a gift from family friends. As my grandma, mom, and I tried to fill it out with him, it just about did us in with all the religious garbage. It's supposed to be a book about life, not xtian thought.After too much religion, grandad told us he was done and wasn't going to put any more in it, and I don't blame him, since this book was not true to him.A non-religious version of this book would have been great, but it's too late for that."
2,Way too religious!!!!!!,"I bought Reflections from a Mother's Heart as well as A Father's Legacy. When I first received the books, I was very excited because they were beautiful on the outside. The questions at first seemed great, until I realized that 1/3 of the book was questions about God, church, Christmas and Christianity. Coming from a family of mixed religion, these books were completely inappropraite and from information provided on Amazon, I did not know this when I purchased it. Unless you are a hardcore Christian, I would not reccomend these books. I was beyond disappointed about these books. I am debating on keeping them and maybe changing some of the questions, but I will have to see."
3,Great book but...,"Overall it's an excellent book to capture details of ourselves to pass down to our children. I just wish the author had not woven religion into nearly every section of the book. Questions such as ""When did you bcome a Christian?"" and ""Do you remember your first communion?"" are not applicable to everyone.While one could certainly just leave those pages blank, it would have been much better if the author had left a larger ""notes"" section at the end of the book or at the end of each chapter... or if the book was printed in a fashion that would enable us to remove pages that are not applicable.Otherwise a very nice keepsake."
2,Overly Religious for my taste,"The concept is fantastic... it is what I was looking for...However, the continuous questions about my Christian thoughts and upbringing are not what I was looking for... while I am a practicing Christian, I find the constant probings of my beliefs and actions annoying.The author should have made this book a more general thought provoking and informational journey of a Father's life that would be read by his child(ren) later on in life.This book is of absolutely no use to any father who is not a Christian and might be considered insulting to someone of another faith that purchased it.I will be returning this book. I think I will be better off starting a personal journal of my own in a good high quality blank journal."
5,Soothing and calming,"If you love the sound of tinkling wind chimes outdoors, wait until you hear the wonderful EnviraScape Wind Chimes. This programmable product allows you to adjust up or down the frequency of the tinkling sound and its calming and soothing effect is wonderful. When I am at home, I leave the chimes on all day to bring in the outdoors. In the evening, I love to light one of my favorite scented candles, have a hot cup of my favorite beverage and just relax to its soothing tones, great after a frazzled day. I highly recommend this product."
4,My mother loved them!,"My mom is a windchime lover! so when I saw this electric windchime, I knew I wanted her to have them. I gave them to her as a gift, and they never leave her kitchen counter - she plays them quite frequently. A nice gift for windchime enthusiasts."
3,Great product but fan broke right away,"I absolutely loved this indoor windchime, but within a week of getting it, the fan stopped working. I tried contacting Homedics Customer Service by e-mail and got no response. Very disappointing."
1,Service was so poor I had to cancel the order,"Placed the order on 11/20, delivery was supposed to be by 12/9. On about 12/1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider, Unbeatable Sale, Inc. to verify that they did have the order. Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order, period, and gave me a number at Amazon to contact. Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first.Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart."
4,Pretty good - one big flaw,"I have the same headset but it was bought at a brookstone store with a brookstone label. These work very well as noise reduction phones and they sound good too. My mp3 player has a graphic eq and with little adjustment i get a great sound. The serious flaw is that when there's a banging noise on the plane or the train, the nc microphone goes crazy and you have to turn off the nc until things calm down."
1,Worst Massager,"I would not call this a massager. It feels like you're giving yourself low level electrical shocks, makes you feel nervous and dizzy. It does not make you feel relaxed in any way whatsoever. Save your money!"
3,I suggest a test drive...,"This device is clearly not for everyone. It's heavy, hard to manuever, and can be hurtful. It can also be blissful, relieving a painful constriction in, e.g., a calf and/or shoulder muscle. I think people who've had experience with shiatsu or even rolfing might be better prepared to use this machine properly and effectively. If you prefer light-touch, swedish massage, this may not be your cuppa.If you've never heard and/or don't understand the instruction, ""breathe into the pain"", think twice before getting one of these."
2,Not good for back massage,I purchased this for my back massage. It was so heavy that i don't want to hold it for 2 minutes by myself
5,HoMedics PA-200H Massager,My chiropracter uses this massager in her practice. It felt so wonderful for my low back pain that I just had to have one for home. I don't know if I'll ever use all the bells and whistles but the programmable massage and heat applications may be just the thing someday.The only negative is the overall weight of 5 pounds which makes it difficult to self-apply. The massager seems sturdy and well designed otherwise.
2,"Works great when new, wears out quickly","I use a percussive massager daily, on the order of two or three fifteen-minute sessions each and every day. I've had a number of massagers now. At least four Homedics. I stopped buying them. They simply will not stand up to that kind of duty cycle. Only one made it past four months before becoming so weak, it was more irritating than helpful. They work okay when new, unless you've tried real pro models.The ones that work weigh a LOT more -- and last about two years. They're typically around a hundred dollars and you can buy them from catalogs that cater to upmarket gadgeteers, such as Sharper Image. When in doubt, ask the weight. Heavier ones last a LOT longer.If you want recommendations on massagers, look at user groups for people with fibromyalgia. Many people with this condition use these daily and know what lasts."
1,HoMedics PA-200H Therapist Select Deluxe,"This massager really disappointed me. It's very hard to handle for more than a few minutes, as it's handle is not shaped well for hands. Worst of all, it is VERY heavy. I have large, strong hands, so I didn't expect that to be a problem.It is also very loud. Maybe I can sell it!"
4,better than most,"Since there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs, I recommend you get this one. Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case. Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry. It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use. The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases. The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned). The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality. The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there. A solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available."
2,"Good looking, clumsy to use","I had high hopes for this case when I bought it, but it just hasn't worked out. The leather has a nice feel, and my iPAQ fit snugly in it's slot. However the stylus on my iPAQ h2215 was impossible to get to without partially removing the iPAQ from it's case. This became so frustrating that I eventually discontinued using this case.It does have three slots for credit cards, and a larger slot that you could tuck a few folded dollar bills or business cards in.Maybe a different model of iPAQ would work better, but it hasn't been a good fit for me."
1,Disturbingly quiet,"Unwrapped as a Christmas gift, my girlfriend thought it was wonderful. We set it in front of the couch, filled it with water, plugged it in, and...NOTHING. Product quality control anyone? Everything looked perfect; I wonder if it was ever tested before it left the plant. Totally disgusted. 1 star is a gift because I can't leave less. Merry Christmas."
2,update last review,I previously made a post stating the machine wouldn't shut off. That was for the fr-700. Someone else also had the same problem.
4,Foot Rejuvenator,"I recently had foot surgery and my boyfriend was thoughtful enough to get this for me. This product has been a great help in the recovery of my foot. Although the description leads you to believe that you get a heater, massager and bubbler all-in-one (you don't); this product is great. The massager is on the outside of the unit as well as the heater. I know people have complained that you have to put hot water in it..but be real...is that so hard??? This unit keeps the water hot for at least 20 minutes (which is more than the recommendid time to soak) and it delivers on all of it's promises.After surgery my foot was stiff, sore and I couldn't bend my toes. After soaking, the heat and massagers helped me gain more flexibilty and eased my throbbing foot. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great product to sooth your feet at the end of the day (or after surgery). :)"
4,Does the job,"I carefully read all of the reviews before I purchased this product, and I only disagree with one review. It is not loud. The bubbles and the massager do make noise - but less than a foot bath at a salon. If you turn on the spinners on top, there is additional noise, but I don't feel like it is an unreasonable amount. Additionally, it was a lot lighter than I expected even with water. When I first used the spinners, they tickled my feet and I thought they were too rough. However, after soaking for a little while, I found that I could use the spinners without experiencing extreme sensitivity. Basically, I like this product and have used it more than once. (A good sign.) I did not give it five stars, because a salon soak and pedicure is still a better experience."
3,works but not that great,"I bought mine on sale and the first one I got was broken. Not only that but if you have to send it in to get covered by the warranty, you have to pay the shipping to and from homedics and at that point, you may as well just buy a new one. That's probably the point but I would highly recommend reading all that info before buying this product. If its on sale its not too bad of a foot bath, it gets the job done. I bought it because it can do both wet and dry massage and it does ok at that. If you have money for a better one definitely go for it."
5,Well-written introduction to Cuzco School of painting and history,"After returning from a trip to Peru in 2012, where I was able to visit the Osma Museum of Colonial Art in Lima and also visit Cuzco, I was interested in re-reading this wonderful book about the Cuzco School of Art. The book not only contains beautiful illustrations, but it also provides a well-written and clear account of the history behind the development of this art and the manner in which indigineous and mestizo painters achieved the syncretism of two different religious beliefs and traditions, by imbibing the European art forms with their own symbolism. Anyone interested in learning about this type of art would do well to start with this book. The author writes in a way that is easy to understand, even for non art-historians, and provides a wonderful and revealing explanation of the cultural significance of these paintings."
2,Recent visitor to New York,"As an avid shopper, I bought this book prior to a recent trip to New York. Unfortunately, I found much of the material in the book to be out-of-date. I wasted a lot of time chasing recommendations which the author made. A number of the stores which were recommended were no longer in business or had moved. Several others had new locations much more convenient for visitors (i.e. in the mid-town area), which were not listed in this book. BEWARE, you need to call and check before you make a trip across town!"
3,Fujifilm E900 Digital Camera,This was an O.K. camera Not the best though.If your going to invest in a digital camera I would highly suggest a Nikon Digital S.L.R. Once you've used one you will never use anything else.
4,Fujifile Finepix E900 9MP,It is everything and more that I hoped it would be. The pictures are outstanding.
1,Arrived Broken,When i was finally able to use the images came out with large lines. Then a few pictures later started comming out almost completely white. 400$ camera that doesnt work. Thanks.
3,Its okay....,"I've had a few problems with this camera. First, I have experienced the interlacing problem (when every other line of image data is lost and its overexposed) and had to send the camera back. Obviously this is a design problem. The tech support was great, and once the camera was repaired, its worked great. I have also noticed that the focusing can be slow and takes some time getting the timing right on the shot.Also, something no one else has mentioned is the fact that you have to manually pop up the flash to get it to auto fire. When Im trying to just point and shoot, and if you arent looking at the lcd (because no data is in the viewfinder), it can be easily overlooked.At higher ISO's (>200), it gets really noisy so even though you can go to ISO800, its really giving up image quality.Overall, Im impressed with the image quality but there are some convenience features that are lacking."
4,Fuji E900,"I've purchased this camera based on literatureand word of mouth opinions. I found it comparable tomany others similar cameras performing equally well.However, I've learned, that for some reasons it isout of production and already not available in Europe. Bargainprices are probably due the fact, that currently the rest ofthem on stock is being sold out."
4,Good camera,"This is our first digital camera, and we are happy with it so far. We have been able to figure out how to use the basic features and to load the pictures on our computer. We would recommend this camera for people who have some savvy with computers and such but are not true techies."
2,Loss of data!,"I purchased this camera, a card, and a card reader. I initially had difficulty connecting the camera to my computer, and when I finally was able (using a usb cable and not the card reader)discovered a bunch of corrupted data. I thought it must be the card. I replaced the card, things seemed fine for a while, but it recently happened again. I have to assume it's the camera, or the provided usb cable. Either way I have no means of transferring files without the fear that I'm going to lose pictures of my kids."
1,"Would give a zero if that were an option -recall, anyone?","I just received this camera from Amazon. Did a great amount of research, read reviews, etc. I am having the same problems that were posted on a review on 19 June 06. Unfortunately, that one was posted after I purchased the camera.There are lines through EVERY picture I have taken except for the ones I took outside on this overcast, cloudy day. They are so overexposed all I see is white light. I can't even tell what the picture is by looking at it. AUUGH! After reading so many glowing reviews, I can only conclude that there's a defective batch out there, Amazon has 'em , and lucky me, I got one.Now onward to the joy of returns, renewed research, and swallowing my disappointment."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Brand new, out of the box and all the pictures it takes look like I took them from behind venetian blinds. Just try and get to technical support...no one wants to talk to you. I spent over an hour trying to reach someone. They wanted me to drive 90 miles to have it repaired....I opted to send it to them in New Jersey where they will ""try"" to fix it, even though I asked for a brand new one since this one never worked. Huge disappointment and I hate it already. Oh and the card they send with it only holds 7 poor quality pictues. I already hate the stupid thing. You would think for what it costs that it would just work or that they would at least be interested in fixing it."
1,very disappointing purchase,"I had a film-based SLR camera that I had invested a lot of money, and just hadn't committed to buying a digital camera yet. When I was burglarized and my camera equiptment was stolen, I figured it was time to make the switch to digital. I did much research online, and finally decided on the Fujimilm E900. When I first got the camera I was impressed with the image quality. To date, that's the only thing I've been impressed with. Pictures are often blurry, the flash is too bright, battery life is quickly eaten up, and worst of all, I've gone through three XD memory cards in this camera. Which, are quite expensive. For some reason unbeknownst to me, this camera seems to render the cards un-usable after just a couple months. For the cost, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this camera. Save your money and purchase a $100 Kodak, Canon, or HP. I use all three at my work very often and have had minimal issues with any of them."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA,"I liked this camera when I first bought it. Then after taking 5 or 6 pictures brand new alkaline or rechargeable batteries would go completely dead. No reaon, not dropped, exposed to any harm - and that's the end of that investment - No care, help from Fuji - have seen many others with the same problem, It's frustrating to see a company can get away with this and we're all powerless (pardon the pun). They offer to fix it for almost the same amount you paid for the camera - Choose another company - or better yet - tell us how to bring a case against Fuji for selling faullty merchandise."
3,Some good some bad,"Molded well and fit like a glove. Mounting tape secured the cap well. Served my purpose to mount a hard tonneau cover.Molding is a little short, not covering the complete front of the bed. Material is about half the thickness of the OEM liner. Shipping box was poor resulting in bending at the center. Once bent, plastic fractures to a white line, but as I said it served my purpose. A little pricey for some plastic in poor packaging."
4,"Fine Performance, But Flimsy Construction","This oven's Inverter system and its smooth operation made it the best microwave oven (probably the 10th one we've owned) to grace our kitchen counter. Large items warmed at lower power settings are heated uniformly; and the sensor system, with its plus/minus adjustment, makes for effortlessly satisfactory results.HOWEVER: The cabinet might have been built by Yugo, and the light was unstable from day one - finally dying completely after only three weeks. Since the bulb is not owner-replaceable Panasonic requires the unit be taken to a service center. For us that would be two 65 mile round trips. We gave the oven to a local charity and replaced it with the more sturdily built - but otherwise identical - stainless steel model, which has the added advantage of seeming less massive in our somewhat cramped kitchen.Go directly to the stainless model, NN-T990SA. We think it earns a fifth star."
4,Anderson window operator,"I have Anderson windows, probably from the 70s. One of the handles had broken and I was so glad to be able to find it available online. The first one sent was a left-hand one instead of a right-hand one, but after returning it they sent the correct one. It works great and I can open and close the window again."
5,great product,"This was a great replacement for the old one, but a little pricy--but was worth it, other than throwing out the window, this was a good alternative"
1,No Good,"This piccolo was purchased this summer. Considering the price we had no expectation that it would be professional sounding, but we did expect it would be playable. After struggling to play it and finally having someone else try to play it and then taking it to a music store to be looked at we found it will not be playable without extensive repair. Only 5 of the pads are somewhat in the correct position. If the pads are salvagable it will take at least $100 to attempt to fix. If the pads need to be replaced it will be upwards of $250 to repair. We purchased a Diplomat piccolo for $100 more than this one and it played beautifully the moment she picked it up. I wouldn't purchase anything sensitive like a piccolo without being able to play it again."
2,Slows down by 1 minute a month,"The only thing good you can say about this clock is that if the power goes out, you don't have to reset it after power is back on. I purchased three clocks many years ago. All of them lose about a minute or so every month. Automatic adjustment of daylight savings time occurs as per the old system (Last Sunday of October and first Sunday in April. Chaney may have fixed this issue in the new models."
1,forgot technology,Chaney Instruments Thor Alarm Clock with Set & Forget TechnologyPluged it in and it was 10mins. slow. Had to set it by hand and it is still 30 to 45 seconds off. I guess you can expect that for $20.00 Wouldn't buy again
1,Sucks,This is a xerox copy of some old run of the mill generic model kit type directions. Doesn't list required supplies or parts list. Diagrams are almost incomprehensible and all are incomplete. RIP OFF
1,Rip off!,"This is a copy that you can probably print up yourself on the internet! I thought that it was going to be a book that I could give to my son to learn about and possibly build, but it is a zerox copy and nothing he would even want to look at. Rip Off!!!"
4,its worth it,"Bought this book a while ago. Yes I did build it and if you have the resources its not bad. You will have choices and will have to decide brake set-up, live axle or not. But the plans work and its a straight forward build."
5,A++ Amazing sound quality,"Amazing sound quality. No crackling, no hissing, no poping, and best of all no delay. Allows my sub to hit its lowest lows. It fits into the rca slot with no problem nice and snug."
3,Heavy and Fast Rockin',"Born Dead Icons: Heavy, fast and angry punk rock straight outta Canada. They are my favorite band from there. This is a disc of re-recorded material. It has great production, and will knock the crap out of you. Not as good as ""Ruins"", though."
4,I carried it with me every day,"Yes, there are some historical and geographical inaccuracies in this book, however as a trip guide it is comprehensive and quite helpful. I recently returned from a 6 day trip through the Black Hills, Badlands and Wyoming. The maps were helpful. The restaurant suggestions were excellent. I took several of the Day Trips recommended outside of the area and enjoyed all of them. If you have time check out Spearfish Canyon, Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary, Canyon Lake, and Chapel in the Hills. These were true highlights. I carried this book with me every day of my trip and frequently referred to it."
4,The licks are still HOT!,"I still rank this as my very favorite. The music is so snappy & twangy and has so many layers that one hears something new and fresh each time. And of course the lyrics beg to be sung along. ""Thanks, Dan!"""
4,Great Recording,I have been a Dan Hicks fan for years. This album (CD) is one of his top three. I highly recommend it.Enjoy.
5,Country cool with style!,Smooth upbeat and whymsical listening with a unique blend of instrumentation and interesting harmonies. Once you've heard this you will look for more.
5,Good Product.,i got this because me and my husband wanted to have a little more fun in the bed room and this does help but it can make you gag a little because of its length... and even when its put on correctly you can still pop it out of your mouth.
1,bad ugly - and not original product,"it's a last time that i ordering something from this shop!i had the original Tantus one, and it's was grate.but this products is not the same.the belts are full of dirty glue and the ball is not like the original one.finally - it's a full ugly , don't buy from them nothing.Tantus Fantasy Gag, Black"
4,"Awesome, but could be longer","I love this toy! It feels great in the mouth, the ridges and grooves are really sensual, it really feels realistic. The thickness is exactly as thick as a real penis, which is really nice. The silicone feels smooth, but attracts hairs like a magnet, which is really annoying because said hairs stick to the gag like a magnet too. The one problem I have with it is that it doesn't go back far enough for me...it goes back to about mid-tongue or so, they can and should make a longer version, if they haven't already...Doesn't come close to gag reflex length, which is what I wanted...so if you're looking for a pretty good penis gag, but not looking TO gag, by all means, buy this product."
1,Not impressed.,"My daughter has CF. I was looking for a good refresher on the basics to keep up with everything. This book is written partially in Euorpean Slang. It is slightly difficult to understand. Overall, not impressed with the purchase."
3,DEBBIE'S A BETTER PERFORMER NOW,"I'm amazed that there are reviewers on this page who prefer this to the 1999 concert. For freeze-frames of Debbie looking gorgeous, I'd rate this pretty high. But her vocals are not at their best here. Her growth as an artist since 1982 has been astounding. If her wrinkles keep you from recognizing that, you never really got her to begin with."
1,Never received .... disappointed !!!,"I still have NOT received this gift and it is December 27th!!I am so disappointed that I cannot find any phone number to call.I have to go back through all of my receipts to see if I was charged for this!!Something NEEDS to be done.I was looking forward to giving this as a gift at Christmas.....Please, please contact me !!!Carol Proctorcaproctor@wowway.com"
2,Incomplete and over priced,Very disappointed. One of the tubes was missing and later I found the same product (complete!!) for half the price at a big discount retailer.
2,Very tiring to read,This work is difficult to read. There are enough exclamation points to exhaust most readers. A lack of humility and the self aggrandizement soon makes the reader quite weary. The subject matter is well woth exploring but the author gets in the way. I cannot recommend this book.
3,You People are deaf,"How can you people say that this cd is as good as Season of the sicc! Listen to season then blocc movement, Lynch totaly changed his style for the worse he dosent flow any more he sounds like hes trying to hard. And c-bo only did one really tight song (dedication) Lynches best was 187 on 24th street and it still wasnt lynch standards. Hopefully Lynch realizes this while making Lynch By Inch. This is Mainstream underground if you understand what im saying...Its still underground but real Siccmade listeners will be disapointed cause this cd is not sicc!"
2,Goose Goofs Off,"This book was about a goose who lazy and did not want to do anything and there was lots of noise outside that was wake up Goose. She tried everything to keep her self from hearing the noises. She even put earmuffs over her ears but she still heard it. Then someone called her and woke her up again. She couldn't get back to sleep so she decided she would watch some TV, but the TV was broke so she went into the kitchen and got something to eat, but the floor was all sticky from the Ice cream. So she decided she would go take a nap on her hammock, but it was too quiet. She smelled something from down the street and followed the smell. It was coming from rabbits house. It was some cookies, she asked rabbit why she wasn't invited and she said because you said you were taking it easy today.This book was a good book, but I don't think it was the best. But it does teach you that being lazy isn't a good thing. I think this book could have been better."
4,Goose Goofs Off,"The book "" Goose Goofs Off "" is not the best book I've read, but it was still a good book. This book could be taken in a couple of different ways itself. This book was about a Goose who puts everything off and doesn't do anything. For example she spilled ice cream all over her kitchen floor. Instead of cleaning it she says "" I'll do it tomorrow ."" Like I was saying, you can look at this in two ways. You could read this and it could tell you that it is ok to be lazy and to not do anything around the house and stuff. Or you could look at it as this book teaches you that if you don't do anything and put it all off, that you will never get anything accomplished. Putting things off, till the last minute isn't the way to do things. It is best do things right away to get them out of the way instead of worrying about everything all at once later."
5,Amazing,This dvd is absoloutly amazing. I bought it 4 days ago and have watched it everyday since. The Temps do a great job in entertaining you. The sweet voice of Ron Tyson and Richard street blow your mind. While Denis Edwards brings that rasp and excitment. It's great to see Otis do his thing and to see Melvin Franklin brought tears to my eyes. His version of old man river is like nothing i've ever heard! I cried all the way through.This is a must have for any Temp fan!
3,bland! Unless you are a collecter spend your money elswhere,"With conductor Valery Geriev and the Kirov opera one gets a fine production of what, to me,is a ""bland"" 174 minute opera that could be reduced by one third with no loss! In the commentary one critic maintains that Rimsky-Korsakov's operas suffer from what may be a ""crippling disability""- a lack of characterization and dramatic power. Sadko has lovely background music to read a book by! It also seems ""padded"". In one scene for example, Sadko is about to set out on his great voyage but before he leaves he asks merchants from three different countries to describe their homelands. This has nothing to do with the plot!"
2,big bore!,I have deep respect for Rimsky-Korsakov as composer butthis opera is utter failure; and I agree with another reviewer sayingit is nonsense. What makes a great music drama for me-- the essentialcombination of good story and brilliant music.
5,"Ideal for parent-child ""read aloud"" bedtime storytelling","In The Lord Is My Shepherd: Psalm 23 For Children, Episcopal priest Christopher L. Wepper adapts the text of one of most well-known and best-loved religious devotions in the Bible for preschoolers and early readers. Enhanced with Preston McDaniel's colorful illustrations, this picture book rendition of the sacred psalm provides a text of the Psalm that is less abstract than the versions commonly read in the Bible while remaining true to the original meaning and accessible to the minds and understandings of children ages 3 to 7. Ideal for family, Sunday School, and community library picture book collections, this edition of The Lord Is My Shepherd is ideal for parent-child ""read aloud"" bedtime storytelling."
1,Don&#65533;t waste your time (or your money).,"Unless you have never seen a wrestling match before, this video series is a waste of time and money. I ordered these after reading the other posted reviews (which said they were great) and was extremely dissatisfied with the teachings and explanations. They are only 15 minutes in length and cover only the most basic moves, moves learned in the first week of any quality wrestling program. They do not explain the rules in full and lack the explicit detail needed to execute any move to it's fullest advantage. I give it a 1 star rating only because I could not give it a zero."
4,Both Majestrate98 and Richardson are right...,"If you have wrestled before, you'll likely not find anything new here. I had NO wrestling experience when I bought these vids, so I enjoyed watching them AND could learn from them (it can be easy to fill a total VOID of knowledge) but I do believe not citing their duration (15' each) on the item description borders on unjust advertising. The series should be sold as a unit for about 1/2 the price of the collected titles; and probably all be put on 1 tape (or better yet, DVD)."
2,Problems with the Sonnet PodFreq...,"Initially I was very satisfied with the PodFreq, but over the course of a couple of months it slowly died. In fact when I first bought it, it definitely met all of my needs. It was the only FM transmitter that was powerful enough to work over many of the radio stations that had given me problems in the past. But that soon changed. Now it won't even work on a station that is clear. This is very disappointing because I payed triple what I have spent on other FM transmitters. I am in the process of returning it for a replacement or repair. I doubt, from reading the reviews here, that this will help. I have to give it try though. Very disappointing"
1,Stay AWAY From This Product!,"I have had to send my PodFreq (for Gen3/40Gb iPod) back to the company in California FOUR TIMES for repairs! If you use it more than a couple of hours per week, IT WILL FAIL within 6 months of its purchase. All of a sudden the unit no longer broadcasts, to the point that you have to touch its antenna to the receiver you're trying to send to! Potentially this is the finest product of its kind; in reality it is the WORST. (You'll notice that the unit is no longer available on Amazon. They wised up quickly I think!)"
3,"Easy to use, but disappointing sound quality","I bought this iPod transmitter more than a year ago, and I use it every time I drive. It's simple to operate and finding a working frequency takes no more than 20 seconds. Because it is wireless, the sounds quality isn't as good as a cassette adapter would be; however my cassette player is broken. I only started to take notice of the lower quality within the past six months and it coincided with listening to CDs again in my car. The difference was dramatic. In addition to quality, the only option for volume control is through the car's player, and when using the transmitter, it sometimes can't be loud enough to ""rock out."" It has proven useful for playing my iPod in the garage on a boombox as well as in my home on my stereo set-up. Overall a decent transmitter that plays music consistently. I haven't used or heard music through other wireless transmitters."
2,Functional but not very attractive,"This map is the typical map you see anywhere. It is North American centered, meaning it splits Europe & Asia down the middle on the right & left side. Otherwise it's functional, but there are a lot of nicer looking maps available. Try to get it laminated so it lasts."
5,A Riot!,"A friend recommended this book to me, and I'm so glad I purchased this one - I'll never grow tired of reading this book, especially certain portions. Beware: there's laughter, tears, and sex! But French doesn't get too graphic and makes the somewhat naive and hormonal Ricki a great character who is fun to read and who can't seem to stay away from getting herself into some really crazy situations. Wish there had been more with the WAR group. Liked the way it ended - wasn't expecting the suspense factor, and it was a bonus. Liked the author's writing style so much, I've ordered her book ""Wayne's Dead""."
5,Terrific Fun!,I really like this new writer and I think that any reader who loves a sexy yet fun storyline in the romance novels they read will have as much fun as I did with CHASING HORSES. Do yourself a favor and add this book to your next MUST READ books from Amazon.
1,Do not be deceived by the favorable reviews!,"Based upon the reviews, I was looking forward to this read. What a terrible disappointment (and I speak for my entire book club!). There's a reason you won't find this book in your typical library or book store. The writer's structure is embarrassingly elementary. The dialogue and dialect are completely contrived. As a young 'southern woman,' I can tell you categorically that no one talks or behaves like this writer's characters. The risqué portions of the book are dreadful, and the relationships preposterous.Since reading the book I have come across another book club equally deceived by the amazon.com reviews."
1,Worst Book Ever,"I like to think of myself as a well rounded reader and I recommended this book, based on other reviews, for this month's book club selection. I have not disliked a book so strongely in a very long time. The writing was boring, not an interesting plot, and too much information about her sex life. Based on this book, I would be hard pressed to ever pick up another book by this author."
5,"romantic comedy has a new star,",Romantic comedy has a new star on its hands with Christine Tillery French--her story is one of the best romantic comedy stories i have had the pleasure of reading in a long time! congrat's Ms. French on a super write and welcome to the world of print!
5,Great Pictures,I have very limited photography experience. I had polaroid 2 MP camaera and wanted to replace it with latest one then I found this deal on Fuji S9000. I am extremly satisfied with photos.I got within 3 days from amazon and tested immediately with auto settings. Photos are great. I love this deal.
4,s7000 to s9000,"I'm not shure about why this s9000 is getting bad reveiws but I have a s7000,I bought this s9000 and compaired the pics at the same settings side by side the s9000 not only was sharper ,it also has better contrast. I tried the zoom all the way and the pic remained sharp.The only thing I have issues with is the auto focus it has a hard time getting to focus.if you ask me ,having both cameras,the s7000 is the disapointment.this camera ,s9000, is tops in my book and worth what I payed for"
5,LOVE this camera!,I really love this camera. I debated between this on and the Rebel XTI. And I'm so glad I choose this one! Not only is it cheaper but comparing pictures with others Rebel pictures it blew them out the of the water. Settings take a little work. Flash is a little bright at close range. But nothing a cheap diffuser can't fix.
4,9 megapix for under 600,"I found the S9000 to be as close as you can get to a pro SLR camera. No extra lenses to purchase. I had no problem setting up the software on my computer. Fuji has done well with this machine,easy to use and loaded with functions I'll never get to I'm sure. In the end it was the 9 mega pixels that sold me. Eliot in Alaska"
4,Good camera but probably my last Fuji,"This is the second Fuji camera I've bought. I've had this for over a year now. I sell my photographs at art festivals and show in galleries, and this is the camera I use. I think it takes fine photographs. You do need to study the manual a bit because it has extensive features. It is slow but I don't take action shots. The manual focus us useless. You can set the camera to manual and adjust the speed but the focus is still ""auto."" Having said that, I have no problems with noise as someone else mentioned. I love being able to switch to shooting black and white by just pushing a button. I think eventually I will try another make of camera just to see what I'm missing."
5,Love this Camera,I have had this camera for a year and I enjoy taking pictures. This camera is easy to work. I recommened it for a first time slr user.
1,Lag time is awful.,"I had a Fuji Finepix S5100. I thought I would be upgrading to a newer, faster, better model. This camera was a huge disappointment. The lag time makes it almost impossible to use. I've tried everything to correct this. Unless you are shooting still life with a tripod just forget it. You'll have nothing but a blur every time. It was an awful waste of money. I still use my S5100, but I am looking at the Canons now. Apparently the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi has no lag time. I guess it is time for me to make the move from this point and shoot (or should I say point and wait?) to a DSLR. I can literally count to 3 between the time I press the button and the picture takes. Good grief."
1,Simply disappointed,"I upgraded from a Fuji S602z to the S9000 thinking that this would be the ultimate upgrade from the wonderful S602, but I was simply disppointed.This camera is just fine in most respects except image quality. The images just aren't sharp and there are too much artificats in the images. The camera also struggles greatly in focusing. The images quality was so lacking that even my family members could tell the difference between similar shots compared to the S602 and Nikon CP8800.Maybe I had a defective model - I'm not sure - but if you're current owner of the S7000 or S602 thinking this camera would be a major upgrade from your current model, you'll be disappointed like me. After two weeks of frustrations I returned it :("
4,Totally Amazing,"This camera is worth every penny i had other digital cameras before and they worked fine, I thought it was time for an upgrade so I decided to look at the fuji , i had no regrets its worth the price and the features is awesome especially the the lcd screen at the back of it.Its detachable feature makes photography more and more amazing,thanks to amazon and its affordable prices ,anybody want an affordable digital high quality camera try this fuji finepix s9000"
4,versatile,"This camera's versatility is what keeps it in my camera bag. It can go from a video camera to a telephoto to a macro at the push of a button. I now own a canon 30d and the thing that keeps the fuji in my bag is the versatile nature of the camera. It covers every possible situation, it's fast and easy to use and is fairly compact. I have used it for many situations and it does great on it's auto settings.I could go on for pages but all I'll say is that if you don't want to jump to a SLR or want a versatile camera that does it all with a wide lens range then this is the camera to buy."
5,My New Best Friend!,This is a Great Camera! No Wonder they have called the Fujis FinePix. Highly Recommend this item.
3,buena resolución pero lenta para procesar,"exelente resolución, pero lenta para enfocar y procesar la imagen, ademas de una inusual luz verde que ayuda al sistema de enfoque y el zoom es manual especial para fotos fijas y sin movimiento y con buena luz a menos que tenga un tripie y no haya movimiento."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I bought this camera a month ago. I am EXTREMELY disappointed. After reading many reviews, I have found that there are many ""duds"" out there.I just called Tech Depot, where Amazon shipped this from, to get a return authorization number so I can get my money back. The gentleman on the other end said this item has been discontinued!!!!!!DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!!! You may be sorry.If you do and get a good one, congratulations! :)"
3,Introduction to biology of fungi,"Modern Mycology , 3rd ed by J.W. Deacon, is a useful introduction to the fungi for advanced undergraduates and grad students in botany, biology or horticulture; a lay person would have to have an unusually good background in biology to get much from the book. A very brief survey of modern classification is given to the level of division, with the rest of the text focusing on various aspects of the biology of the fungi. Various biochemical aspects of fungi are particularly well covered and there are interesting treatments of decomposer communities, mycorrhizae and fungi as pathogens. The book is copiously illustrated with clear line drawings and black and white photos and there are 23 beautiful color plates. I would like more systematic information, but I understand that this is the area of mycology most in flux."
2,Where's the caffeine?,"This gum didn't work for me. I tried to use it during exams to be able to stay up a little more than usual and this did not help even a little. I am not sure what kind of people this works on but here are some tips:1) I think it works only on people who are extremely sensitive to caffeine. I am sensitive to caffeine, but not terribly.2) Possibly, it works only when taken early enough. As in, if you take it when you are starting to fall sleepy, then it's pointless, but if you take it early in the evening, it may be more helpful.I did not even feel energized and it did not help me with my migraine (either like sodas do.) If people who want this are those on who coffee does not work, then I doubt this will work either."
5,Good Bat and Ball,This is the good ole original wiffle bat & ball set that we all grew up playing with. Doesn't seem as though they have changed it at all. Well constructed and made in the US.
4,Pretty good text book,"I bought this because it was required for a class, it goes into good detail and the explanations are pretty strait forward making it easy to understand the first time through, but also has the details to be a good refrance book."
3,It's okay for the price,I purchased one set since there was no photo and opted not to order more. It is appropriately small for an individual setting and okay quality for everyday use. I would not use it with my formal Lenox china though.
5,Quintessential Cultural Revolution Literature,"[...]As you will see, it is irrelevant to rate it, but Amazon gave me no choice. I gave it 5 stars not because it is good literature, but because it is an essential reference for anyone wanting to understand 'Acupuncture Anesthesia' as it was professed in China at the time of Nixon's rapprochement.KA"
2,"Nice broth, but the asparagus was woody.","This soup was very pricey, and having tried the Moon Soup and really liked it, I picked up this Asparagus-Potato soup. Very disappointing -- while the broth was deliciously rich, there were several large lower-stalk cuts of asparagus in the soup that were inedible, i.e., I had to spit the woody pieces out. Not so good... if they did a little quality control on the veggie cuts, it would be a home run."
2,Disappointed in Toy,"This toy is cute on the onset but that's it. The doors pop off all the time and it's extremely irritating for an adult to continue spending time popping the doors back on. A toddler can't pop the doors on back by themselves and few, if any, 18 mo olds are going to be able to use the keys to lock/unlock the doors (that continue to pop off) of the house. The houses nest but again, the doors pop off in the process. I gave this toy 2 stars because the figures are cute and the concept of the fairy tale toy is good but I would not recommend that someone pay full price for this toy."
2,Disappointing,"The doors fell off the houses the first time we played with it. I could understand if my boys were tossing them around the room, but they were actually playing quite calmly with them. The concept of the houses is so much fun. Sadly, it's too frustrating for a toddler to have the toy fall apart every time they want to play with it.I tried to contact the company, but so far, no response...."
3,fun little pig but may be able to blow house down!,"This is a great toy. My son loves it and plays with it often and his 4 year old sister often trys to steal it from him because she loves it too. He was about 18 months when we got it for him. He has, however, broken a couple of the doors off several times. They go back on fine, but a bit of plastic did break off with them, though they do hold on fine once you put them back on. If the plastic was a little thicker it would be much more durable. If you have gentle children I would buy this in a heartbeat...and would even buy it again for our son...however, if you have children who are a little rough on toys, I wouldn't get this."
2,good idea but poor construction,"Nice idea but poorly constructed. The doors pop off all the time, and it is frustrating for the kids. Also, it is hard to turn the keys on the doors, so the little ones lose interest. With minor improvements it would be a good toy."
4,entertains 9 month old!,"bought for my first grandchild, she is now almost 5, will play with it still, my 9 month old also loves to play with it. the doors do pop off, they don't seem to mind."
1,"Poorly made, breaks easily, too many parts","At first glance, this seems like such a cute toy. The nesting houses give the impression that this toy will ""pack away"" into itself. However, once taken apart, there is no way to get all the figures, keys and houses back inside the main house. Next, all of the doors will pop off the houses within a couple hours of play. (Without even much effort to pull them off; my 12-month old took care of it herself.) It's not a clean ""pop"" either, part of the door hinges are now missing, so the doors won't stay on. The keys are useless for a toddler, if you can keep track of them at all. That leaves the parent having to jimmy open the doors using some sort of utensil whenever the keys go missing. Perhaps the most hilariously bad part of this toy is the ""wolf"", which everyone (kids and adults alike) calls ""the fox"". Because it looks exactly like a fox. Save your money!"
1,Worst Dal Makhani ever!,"I liked their mutter paneer, so ordered dal makhani as well, but to my disappointed, it smelled horrible, and tasted even worse! Going back to Haldiram's Dal Makhani. Plain waste of money!P.S.: I bought it from another store though."
4,great for the price,"i installed these in my 89 dodge lancer and they sound great. the tweeters hit the mids and highs pretty well, but the speaker cone distorts a little at high bass levels. still, these are great speakers for only being like $25"
3,"sound fine for $10 speakers, oh yeah! Two in a box!","5.25"" is a round speaker, not as the picture. And there are 2 in a box, so now I have 8 of them. nice. sound good though. nothing spectacular but better than my blown out stock speakers."
4,Real country style album,Livin it up is a good album by George Strait for the most part. I really think though that the singles are the best songs of the cd and they were wisely chosen. All 3 singles stayed at #1 on the country billboard charts back then for then 5 weeks each. These were some of his biggest singles ever. The other 7 songs are good but are very dry though and alot of the nonsingles are missing emotion. But livin it up is a great record by george.
5,classic country,"This is classic country music at its best. Lively, varied and rich with pedal steel guitar, it holds its appeal over the years. One of Strait's better albums I think, and can be found cheaply on Amazon."
4,Design of Library Automation Systems : File,It a wonderful reference both for students and professors. I very detailed steps on procedures and practices
4,BRINKMANSHIP!,"This is a first for me of Cindy Gerard. Fast paced, fairly good thriller and hot romance. I give it an 8 out of 10 for sensuality.Darcy and Ethan have been divorced for 5 years, yet cannot forget each other. He is special forces. Darcy gets into a jam and leaves a cryptic message begging him to rescue her. The chapters waffle from the present to five years ago. Both scenerios are interesting and exciting. The ending of each chapter makes you frustrated that you are going back 5 years, but it is well worth it.Quick read. I shall look for others by Ms. Gerard."
5,Action-packed suspense with emotion,"Terrorist groups, kidnapping, jungle action and a marriage gone bad...this book has it all. Fans of adventure or military romantic suspense should love it: a good combination between relationship issues and contemporary terrorism dangers. Ethan must rescue Darci from the jungles in the Philippines before she is killed. The couple had been married several years earlier, then divorced, due to psychological strains caused by Ethan's special forces experiences and Darci's job aspirations. Ethan has several siblings, 2 of which have already had books in the series and the last brother's is yet-to-come. The stage was set, though, for his future story in this novel by showing his budding interest in one of the rescued hostages...who disappears mid-story, but who had been used by a relative as a ""victim/experiment"" of some sort. It sounded fascinating and I am now waiting eagerly for that novel to be released."
5,Loved it,"To the Brink was a great read, I couldn't put it down! I just had to read ""Into the Dark"" to find out Amy and Dallas's story. Eathan was a great guy that you wanted to see make it right with his ex wife. Dracy still loved him after 5 years of being apart. You could feel the chemistry between them and their need to be together again. Another great book by Cindy Gerard."
1,Don't waste your $$,"this is just an outline of the book. I was actually looking for the solutions book that has the problems worked out so you can see if you are doing it correctly and to help in learning. The description should say ""Outline"". This is basically useless but expensive. Amazon, please change the info to reflect it is just an outline book, no problems!!"
4,"Nice bag, worth the money",Bigger than I thought. It's also tough enough for the homeowner although it may not be rugged enough for the professional
4,Decent bag for Medium Duty sevice,"Picked up this bag on sale (~$12) to be used in my SUV to hold misc tools, flashlight, ice scraper, etc. Bag was a bit bigger than I thought - the end coolers add about 5"" or so on each end. Quality of bag is pretty good - sturdy enough for tools in the trunk. I have other M-N tool bags that were more expense, but are more heavy duty, and those hold up REALLY well.All in all, this M-N ""cool mouth"" bag is a good value!"
3,A decent romance.,"This is an interesting romance and intriguing mystery but it seemed a bit jarbled. The first half of the book was great, but the second seemed rushed and did not go into enough depth for me. Then, when it looked like the book was going to end, it didn't. It seemed like the author threw in one extra twist that was unnecessary and did not flow with the book, and then tried to explain it. Even the characters said it made no sense! In any case, the romance was sweet and most of the book was enjoyable, I just wish it had ended a bit sooner."
2,It was alright,I actually thought it was a stupid movie But I was forced to watch because I know a few of the people in it so I wanted to be nice and support them.
4,"Id give it five stars, if only it were on DVD","I know, I know... It's been said before. But I just wanted to reiterate that this is a movie that NEEDS a full on DVD. Hopefully, someone at Universal will read these reviews and figure out that they could make a buck by distrubitng this in DVD format. The movie itself is a great comedy, with well developed charecters (sometimes over the top, but clearly this is intentional), and the dialogue is just hilarious. This movie is a great example of what a good script combined with excellent casting can do for charecter interaction. It's always nice when you can see that the writer, director, and actors are all on the same sheet of music. Watch this movie if you want to laugh. If you don't like laughing, then I suggest you seek therapy. Oh, and watch this movie when you're cured."
2,Not Very Safe Men,"I purchased this DVD based on glowing recommendations from Amazon customers and Entertainment Weekly magazine. Sadly, my husband and I don't share their enthusiasm. The film is dark, crude, and crass: with torture cruelty, lots of cursing, and low-brow ""humor"". In the first half-hour I think we possibly chuckled twice -- it fell that flat for us. We gave up a bit before the halfway mark because we just weren't having any fun.Maybe we're just the wrong audience, though we have other Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn movies that we enjoy, and we like quirky humor. However, we have a limited tolerance for cursing and very low threshold for cruelty and darkness.We recommend ""The Maiden Heist"" as a good alternative to ""Safe Men"". ""The Maiden Heist"" has quirky humor and fine character actors (Christopher Walken, William H. Macy, and Morgan Freeman) and an enjoyable, and off-beat, heist premise. It has a few curse words, but not many, and the three characters are quite endearing."
3,Safe Men,"Great to see the early work of some of the better actors around today, and probably the most under apprciated. Here you'll find a smart, intelligent and quick witted movie. The film mixes weird situations with off-beat characters, which results to a laugh-fest."
2,SAFE MEN shoulda been LOCKED OUT!,What are these people doing? There are good actors here and they've somehow agreed to participate in a less than Infomercial quality production.
1,Dumb and Dumber meets The Pink Panther ?,"This 1998 bomb is as horrible as the infamous Jack Black-Ben Stiller train wreckEnvy, and that, my friends, is bad company.Safe Men is loaded with talented actors, but they must have been high on toxic mushrooms, because the script is shit, and they all wallow in it like pigs.Paul Giamatti, Steve Zahn, Mark Ruffalo, Sam Rockwell: shame on you for pulling down this paycheck. Truth be told, there probably wasn't much of a payday to go around; in its limited theatrical release, Safe Men didn't earn enough money to buy a new car.To the viewer: ignore this direct-to-turd embarrassment, and give thanks that the actors went on to better things.Paul Giamatti (John Adams)Steve Zahn (Happy, Texas)Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count on Me)Sam Rockwell (Moon)"
1,An average book for a budding amateur.,"I think the book is good value for an absolute novice with a Sunday morning to kill. The book is a tiny one in terms of pages. Being a reprint of a book that was printed over a hundred years ago, you have sketches of coins to look at. Overall it's a quick read but information wise it falls short - I mean way way short. I do find reading the views of a coin enthusiast from many years ago interesting. If you know about Pridmore, the Krause catalog etc, I doubt you'll want to read this book."
4,Epson Remanufactured Compatible Cartridges,Abacus should put different photo for this product. It isn't the product that you get with your order. Not the sellers fault. Product sent seems to work OK. Price is great. Cartridge cost averaged out to be $1.58 per item. And that included shipping cost! Can't beat that!
4,"would get 5 stars, but there is one problem","The story was a delight, the romance perfect and the pacing fast. It really did have everything a Red Dress Ink book is supposed to have, but Miss Bubbles was a bit off at times. There were way too many times that Miss Bubbles did things that no cat would ever do. A part of the reason I bought this book was because of Miss Bubbles, and I doubt I'm the only one who did. I am a HUGE cat fan, and found it a bit disconcerting when Miss Bubbles acted in an un-cat like way. The biggest--and worse--offense was at the end when Miss Bubbles did something only a dog would do (jump up and lick its owner's face). Still, this book was a lot of fun, and the writing was good. All the other characters will make you keep reading, and the plot was just too much fun. I would have given this five stars if Miss Bubbles acted like a cat. Still, it's worth a read."
2,disappointed,"It doesn't measure up to disney quality. It is cheaply made and feels like it will break in your hands. One of the house's didn't work. I love Disney and that is why I got it, but this really isn't worth the hefty price.... maybe for $20."
5,Best band-aids!,"I got coverlets originally from the doctor after a surgery. I knew immediately they were the best bandaids. These work very well for active people. They stick on very well and when you peel them off they dont hurt. Me and the wife call them ""coverlays"" because theyre like hi-class bandaids. Boo Boos, watch out!"
2,Works great for VoIP but VPN is extremely slow,"I bought this router to replace a desktop that I use as an internet router (cable internet) and to use to to put a Cisco VoIP gateway behind the router. For VoIP and general internet use, it works great but if you use VPN (L2TP in my case), the speed is excrutiatingly slow through this router. This is consistent with other users' experiences. When I put my desktop (which is an old and slow machine) back as the router, VPN speed is at least 20 times faster. This is after all my troubleshooting and I'm a networks engineer. If you need VPN, don't get this router."
2,VPN Broken or at least enourmously hard to configure,"Background: I have 13 years as a network engineer. I bought this box with the anticipation that I could use it as a VPN endpoint, allowing me access to my home network from my WinXP laptop when I'm away from home. Before buying it, I verified with D-link that I could do it. So far, though, I have been unable to get it to work. (VPNs are not *that* hard to set up....)On the bright side, the web-based interface is very easy to use and gives you a finer degree of control than many similarly priced routers. For example, it allows me to enable/disable responding to PING requests from the WAN side, allows FTP'ing to ports other than port 21 and so on.... Heck, if I didn't need the VPN capability, I'd buy it again. As it is, I'll probably end up returning it."
3,Simplistic but Satisfying Read,"I enjoyed this novel although the plot was overly simplistic and quite predictable. The author does a good job of explaining why Rafe is so mistrusting of women, but at the same time I found it hard to believe that a man of his stature would marry a lady gambler that easily. The fact that her background never came up once she was married was hard to swallow. I also think it took too long for them to admit that they loved one another. All in all however I would recommend it as a fast easy read that will provide a few hours of enjoyment."
2,Marginal at best,"I have read many of the for Dummies books and for the most part I have found them to be well organized with relevant information at your fingertips. Alas, this book is not one of those. The author attempts to keep things cute and lively with all sorts of little catch phrases and other humorless items (can you say bob saggett) but it really just confuses and annoys. Several times I have turned to this book searching for a quick explanation on how to do something and found it nearly impossible to find. The index and appendix are not particularly helpful and many of the descriptions give you just enough information to get into trouble. While most of the ""for Dummies"" series are extremely helpful, this one is not one of them."
5,Creamy reduced carb delight,"My husband and I have successfully dropped considerable weight by reducing our carb intake. The single thing I missed the most, however, was chocolate. And despite all the press about the benefits of dark chocolate, my favorite is still a good European style milk chocolate. These bars are creamy deliciousness! I'm not saying they are diet food, just that for us, we appreciate less sugar in any treat this tasty. Yum!"
1,not as advertised,Picture looked great but the product was not as advertised. It came with a commercial logo on it--maybe a promotional item used by that company. The seller agreed to take it back when I complained. Seller also paid return postage but I had to ask.Too much hassle for me--I would be reluctant to use this seller again.Standard gold cross pen is probably fine but this wasn't it.
2,Beyond Disappointed,"Let me just say I am incredibly loyal to the Cross name as well as Amazon. Unfortunately, this timeless pen has degraded in quality ever since they moved production to China. Like many, I ignored the negative reviews, but you should trust them. Perhaps I received a knockoff or a bad batch (bought from Trend Marketing), but the gold is spotted and the clip seems almost a bit rusty, which is unacceptable. This will be returned and bought from the cross website."
4,Good Pen,"You can't really go wrong with a Cross pen, it's the Toyota of pens. Simple, dependable, durable, and good overall quality. The Customer Service provided by the seller was also very good. The only doubt I had was whether the pen was new or preowned. But, overall I am really happy with my new Cross Pen!"
1,HELPFUL REVIEWS,I lost my gold cross pen recently which I had for many many years. I was about to buy another just now. Reading the reviews I will not buy it because it is made in China and of inferior quality. I only buy products made in the USA now and am grateful for all who told me of it being made in China.Thank You
1,bad cross peen,"dont buy it.It is so bad peen, loos the gold in top or button. I WILL NOT BUY GOLD, ON AMAZON ANNY MORE. I ONLY HAVE THE PEEN 1 YEAR ,used MY PEEN 5 TIMES. THE VALUE IS ONLY 10 $. No stars from mee"
2,Disappointed,"I have been using Cross product for lat 15 years. This product which is Made in China, has highly disappointed me. The finish of the pen is very poor. Gold plating is of a poor quality. It has some patches of a different color. The body has sharp edges.Overall it has spoilt my impression about Cross products.RegardsR.P. Kale"
1,Shoddy workmanship,"Cross Pens claim to produce ""jewel-quality craftsmanship."" While that was once true, it no long is. I had to use sandpaper on the inside tube to eliminate the gap where the two halves of the pen didn't fit together. This pen was made with SHODDY WORKMANSHIP."
5,I love this bag,"It has everything I want in a bag - all the compartments that allow you to find what you need immediately - no searching. It's perfect. I've bought 2 of them. My first one was the small saddle color bag, very beautiful English tan leather, the next one, when I outgrew the smaller one, was a large black. I prefer the saddle color. Now that I am semi retired, I'm going back to the small saddle colored one. The big one is too big for my lifestyle now. I highly recommend this item and, also, very important, the leather is nice, soft as butter. You won't be disappointed."
2,Good cast is wasted in Shanghai,"I hate to say it but this was lackluster dull and boring. A total waste of a great cast which included Walter Huston, Gene Tierney and Victor Mature.I like all 3, but this movie just didnt do it for me.To me it seemed like the entire movie was in an underground Asian casino, with Victor Mature was just lounging or hanging around. Walter Huston was a big wig that just didnt have enough spark. Gene Tierney was ok in this, but again, this was nothing special. I couldn't get into this one. The DVD print was like Alpha video, maybe a little bit better. Very un-entertaining I'm sorry to say."
4,BEAUTIFUL DECADENCE!!!!!,A beautifully decadent film. Shanghai Gesture cries out for a full restoration. The Image DVD is a rather beat-up print with a lot of hiss in the soundtrack. The first few seconds of the main title has Raymond Rohauer Presents replacing United Artists.
3,clearly censored,"I think this film exceeds in censorship. It's impossible in such a corrupt casino there's no clear exposition of drugs and prostitution that the ambiance plenty of ssmoke or suspicious fog suggests fully as the decadency of many personages. Victor Mature is a bad actor, but Gene Tierney is beautiful a surely she and the other women aren't in such a morbous club for only selling cigarettes. Vice is breathed all time, but isn't show. Make up is exaggerated. This movie his fun if one doesn't have many exigences and with more liberal times could be of regular quality."
2,A Feeble Gesture,"Compared to the earlier LD and VHS releases from Mystic Fire Video, this DVD is a major disappointment. The source print is abysmal, scratchy and spotted throughout, and there are a couple of jarring jumps in the soundtrack. This bizarre film's best attributes are its atmospheric, moody cinematography; the Oscar-nominated set decorations by Boris Levin; and the sumptuous beauty of the then-20-years-old Gene Tierney. Unfortunately, none of these virtues are adequately presented on the DVD transfer. A pity."
4,A DVD zone SHANGHOLLYWOOD,"Strangely enough, Gene Tierney isn't the main character of Von Sternberg's THE SHANGHAI GESTURE, neither Victor Mature alias Dr. Omar, nor Walter Huston. No, the picture is haunted by the Sternbergian character of ""Mother"" Gin Sling who steals the show whenever it appears. Ona Munson and Von Sternberg have created here a figure worthy to stay in the annals of cinema if not in the cinematographic harem of this director, in the company of Marlene Dietrich.Too bad that the quality of the DVD presented by Image isn't at the level of the movie. Bad images, bad sound and extra poor bonus features. This shows how highly this company thinks of the movie lovers."
3,Masterpiece in need of a good restoration!,"I love love love the movie: the kind of movie that makes you travel in space and time, but it is a trip to Hell rather than Paradise! Amazing cast of characters (and actors), decor, plot, and costumes (oh yes, lots of great dresses and headdresses) and a totally scrumptious dialogue. However, the DVD transfer is visually rather poor, and auditively execrable (shame shame shame , for this Shanghai Gesture dialogue is first class, and the musical soundtrack very interesting too.) Somebody , please, re-do the DVD properly this time, and I 'll buy it and watch over and over again!"
2,Chocolate,"I was very excited that I was able to find this candy on-line, especially at amazon as it is my girlfriends favorite and she thought she could only get it in PR. Unfortunately the candy must have been on the shelf for a long time and seemed to be ""stale."" I will try again though hopefully it was only that box."
5,This is now my favorite candy bar!,"I've always desired an Almond Joy without the almonds since I was a kid. I didn't enjoy the Mounds because of the dark chocolate, and the Almond Joy because of the almonds. Bounty has more coconut filling than the Mounds bar, also. I intended to share, but have only shared one candy bar so far out of the 24.Delicious! Will order more in the future!"
2,Promotion pack,Item was promotion pack and it was about to expire. Doesn't taste as fresh one... It took along time to arrive as well!!
4,Very Pleased,I ordered these for the family so they could have a familiar taste from home. They were so excited. This product was fresh so I was very pleased.
3,Sorry I Brought U.,"Rakim, what can i say, masterful lyrisit, that being said you really cant touch him. however on this album he still shows his lyric skills, but the beats r whack, and the samples r forgetable.. i would only give this 1 star, but its Rakim... & he still got soul.. but not the right production team.. to bad for the tru lyrisits.."
5,Sho'nuff,Well it's simple guys if you like Eric b and takin this is definectly a must have cd it bring back the good old days
