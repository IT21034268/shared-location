4,Classic,"Required reading. Pretty boring, and hard to get through the whole thing, but a pretty important book to ""have read."""
5,Excellent hypothesis in need of an update,"Amazon recommended this book and this time I found the recommendation to be very good indeed. Kuhn develops is argument slowly and methodically building carefully upon his initial themes. His precise style reminds me of Darwin’s Origin of Species although this book is far more readable. His ideas have stood the test of time and have influenced many fields as is obvious from the overuse of his phrase the “paradigm shift”. I enjoyed the book thoroughly but felt it could do with an update. I would be particularly interested in the overlap between his ideas and complexity theory, the similarities between paradigm shifts and phase transitions and the ways in which his argument may be influenced by the works of people like Matt Ridley and his ideas on the evolution of human cooperation detailed in his book “The Origins of Virtue”"
4,"Intersting book , but not for easy reading","Thomas S. Kuhn, the former professor of phylosophy at MIT, explains us the ideas, causes, events, and effects of scientific revolutions. He gives the definition of the ""paradigms"" and shows the way they work. Mainly, the author explaines that the resulting ""shift"" from the old paradigm to a new one is a scientific revolution itself. The clarifying of the major differences between the pre- and the post-paradigm periods in the development of science plays an important role too. The only problem is that the major aspects of the book aply to the natural science only. Very well-written and well-systemized book. It might be especially interesting for scientists who like to see and understand the history of their field."
1,esoteric rambling,"The book is esoteric. It is esoteric due to the author's writing style. The author prefers lengthy half page paragraphs and sentences that will typically take up multiple lines of text. The subject matter contained within this book is tedious enough without the writing style making the book inaccessable.This is a short book. However, expect to read it 2-3 times. Eventually you will get it, but it is going to be frusterating if you have to read the book in a short amount of time due to an assignment for class. Highly recommend you read wikipedia first to get a gist of the content before diving into Kuhn. Otherwise, expect to be taken on a scientific road trip without a map that will leave you going in circles and with a headache."
3,Incomplete and misleading,"Kuhn's book is eminently popular and with good reason - it surveys a large number of important historical developments in science.Unfortunately, his main thesis for which the book is famous, namely that science occurs in incommeasurable revolutions, is very dubiously supported. A more careful investigation of cases (see, for instance, P. Kitcher's book _The Advancement of Science_ and _The Norton History of Chemistry_) suggests Kuhn is wrong. A logical analysis suggests the strongest reading of his thesis is logically false (see Bunge's _Philosophy of Science_). Read these and decide for yourself case by case; it may be that some scientific developments are ""more Kuhnian"" than others."
3,Good for the brain...not a page turner,"I read this book because I thought it would be good for me. And I don't deny that it was. As many point out, its just so important to the way we think about things now that it's a worthwhile read. Also, I think the more time you're willing to put into the book, actually thinking about the arguments presented, the more you will get out of it. But it isn't a page turner. There were points at which I really wished I was done with it, so I could read something else."
2,The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"Frankly I found this book difficult to understand. It isn't hard to grasp the concept of the book, but forget trying to retain anything specific."
3,hmmm. not bad for one man,"I think Kuhn has definitely stumbled on something important here, but his book is badly worded and difficult to process mentally. perhaps a book written on kuhn would be better.don't underestimate the power of the mind. i don't expect this to come up as a review. END"
5,Seminal Work In Science Philosophy!,"If you are interested in science history, or science philosophy...IN ANY DISCIPLINE,...this book should be on your bookshelf (hopefully dog-eared and read!). I found Kuhn's ideas not at all discipline-specific. He describes general theories about how change and innovation take place, and the importance of the social/political/intellectual context that influence adoption or rejection of change (regardless of context). I am an educator and found his principles highly applicable to systems theory, technology adoption, ethical issues in science, organizational psychology, etc. I found the book fascinating...and I do not have a hard science background."
3,not bad...but,"This book isn't bad, but the great biography of Dean Martin is still to be written. Nonetheless, this book is a vast improvement over Nick Tosches' ""Dino."" While Tosches elected to write the fluffy, tabloid nonsense version of Martin's story, this is at least a traditional biography. Other reviewers are correct that entirely too much time is spent on Martin's films; much more detail should have been spent on his singing. In particular, I would like to see a biographer discuss the divide between Martin's earlier hits and his later ones. It seems to me that there is a lot to be said about the traditional tunes, such as ""Memories Are Made of This"" and ""I'd Cry Like A Baby"" and later ones, such as ""One Cup of Happiness"" and ""Lay Some Happiness on Me."" These later songs come long after the high tide of the Rat Pack (circa 1966). While Martin's life certainly is complicated, and he was a purposeful enigma, I think a biographer can do better than exhaustively discussing ""Irma La Duce."""
4,How's Your Bird?,"This is a nice, level-headed biography of the man and his work. It's short on fluff and long on detail. A bit too much attention, though, is paid to the movies, especially the terrible ones. All in all, a terrific character study. You'll learn a lot."
4,A good look,"This book is a nice, basic look at Dean Martin's life. I am a Frank Sinatra fan and of course became interested in Dean as well. I watched several biographies of Dean Martin and so I had a good overview of his life. This book helped with some details, mostly his movies. The author talks a lot about Dean's movies and I found this helpful, but had I already known all of Dean's film roles I probably would have found it tiresome after a while. However, I'm glad I read the book. It was helpful on dates and smaller details that are glossed over in television biographies. I recommend this book for new Dean Martin fans. If you are a diehard Dino fan, this stuff won't be news to you. Its an easy read."
2,Martini Man - The Boring Story of Dean Martin,"I was anticipating a great book about Dean Martin as I was pleased with Schoell's work on The Rat Pack book he co-authored with Quirk. This book was highly disappointing. It delved way too much into details about the movies Dean made and the people involved in those movies. I was hoping that it would examine Dean's life, his attitudes, his relationship with the Rat Pack, mob and of course, all those women. The book, Living in the Dirty Business of Dreams. by Tosches is by far a better examination of Dean's life. Sorry Schoell but: Everybody don't love your writing sometimes. Ooooh, how's all these people get into my room?"
3,Author Apparently Wants to Be Roger Ebert,"I read this book thinking I'd pick up some interesting insights on Dean Martin, his partnership with Jerry Lewis, and his friendships with people such as Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. While ""Martini Man"" does present some interesting information about the aforementioned subjects, too much of the book, as other reviewers have noted, contains endless movie reviews of Dean's movies. I mean, do we really need every plot turn of every movie Dean ever made? I think the reader would have preferred to read about Dean's relationships, and, while some of that is there, the bulk of the book seems devoted to detailed story descriptions of Dean's movies.There is very little discussion about Dean's recordings, and his career as a singer. Dean, when he wanted to, could really sing, and it's a shame Schoell did not spend more time discussing Martin's music."
2,One Long Film Review,Martin was a primarily singer not an actor. However in this book his singing is relegated to third place. Endless information regarding his films makes you wonder if the writer harbours the desire to be a movie reviewer. Major points of interest are given a couple of lines while every film is given pages and pages. I was looking forward to this book but the lack of detail on anything other than film is disappointing.
3,a collection of DINO & Everybody loves Somebody,"I have read this book and was not enlightened by the author's summation of Dean Martin and what was going on in his mind. We'd like to know more about this great talent but all this writer can do is guess or assume what made this man so popular. It could be that he was a likeable, talented, mind your own business type of guy."
3,slow read,I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I had hoped it would have more pertinent information on Mr. Martin and not just repeats of what I have already read. I cannot honestly recommend it to others.
2,Dean Martin-The Hollow Man,"Some people have tried to push the view that Dean Martin was an underrated artist.I take the opposite view-Dino was vastly OVERRATED.If he hadn't hitched his star to a genious like Jerry Lewis,he'd be totally forgotten today.THe man recorded literally hundreds of songs between the 40's and the 80's,and how many are remembered today?Exactly 2-""That's Amore"",&""Everybody Loves Somebody"",that's it.His singing style was basically Bing Crosby with a leer in his voice.Of his movies sans Jerry,the less said,the better.Only ""Rio Bravo"" is remembered today.(I will refrain from mentioning the excrable ""Matt Helm"" movies.)Dino was a man who just didn't give a damn about anybody,anything,except himself.William Schoell does his best to excuse and explain all of Dino's rotten actions,but it's clear that Dino was just a selfish,arrogant jerk."
5,lady horne,"the lady and her music is lena horne at her best an encridible journey through this legends career she sings to death angry sexy and hillarious in a 20minute talking segment on her hollywood career. never have these clssic jazz songs been sung with such talent ,"
5,Authors draw on their roots to provide some downhome fun,"Not only does this book make an excellent high-contrast coaster for your evening beer, it also provides the reader with true design insight not usually found in dry school-oriented textbooks. Dr. Stephen Hall's intorduction to the finer points of home-built Tesla coil design will help save the hair of thousands of potential human inductors. Sr. Professor Garrett Hall sheds his good boy image during his treatise on creating effective electroshock devices used for interrogating runaway sheep.Prof. Emeritus McCall shows us again that for some reason, Bozeman, MT truly is the home of the universe's system electrical characterization braintrust. It's scary that these good 'ol boys can write so well."
2,The usual entertaining light fare. AUDIO version reader is TERRIBLE,I enjoy the Amanda Quick novels. Sometimes they are just the perfect thing. The writing is not sophisticated or brilliant but that is exactly what I want at times. This Brilliance Audio version is read by Anne Flosnick and I think her voice is breathy and whiney and just awful! It really is spoiling the book for me. Maybe I will just toss it and get the paper version!
5,Amanda Quick at her best!,"This was such a wonderful book! It often had me laughing out loud. I loved Olympia and Jared, and the secondary characters were great. Read it, you won't regret it!"
5,A must read,This is the first of all Amanda Quick novels I read. I strongly recommend all romance novel readers to read this book.This book got me hook for all Amanda's novels. It is funny and light.
3,Acceptable,"The plot itself was excellent, but it seemed to be going nowhere. Only occasionally did Miss Quick throw in the investigation details about where the jewels were hidden. Then at the end, we're left with being told that the jewels were on some island and that a boat would leave in a fortnight to go find them. It left the reader hanging. I usually love her books, but this one just didn't have that spark. I also didn't care for the hero and heroine's relationship. There wasn't a spark to that either. Not one of her best works, but I've read worse by other authors. If you're considering trying her books for the first time don't start with this one. Try Rendezvous, Slightly Shady (this is part 1 of the trilogy), Don't Look Back(part 2) or Late for the Wedding(part 3) Wicked Widow, With This Ring, Ravished and almost all her other books are better than Deception."
4,"Entertaining, but not the best romance novel I've read","The plot was generally entertaining and kept me pretty intrigued. I read this book really quickly because it was definitely fun and lighthearted. I'm not sure I really buy the romantic pairing of Jared and Olympia. I found Olympia and Jared each to be slightly annoying in some parts and didn't really understand each's attraction to the other. It just seemed that one moment they were just there and the next there was romance between them.I would recommend this book, but I would not go so far as to claim that it was one of the best I've read or even very romantic for that matter."
4,Not as go as Mischief,"This was my second Quick book and certainly won't be my last. I had a great time reading it but I was not so impressed with the ending. Hopefully, her other books will restore my faith once again as it did with the first one that I read, Mischief!"
3,fun,"Jared is not a pirate - his great-grandfather was. The family lost their fortune and great-grandmother's diary! (it's suppose to contain clues to where Captain Jack's treasure is buried). Jared rebuilt the family shipping business and now takes his turn in trying to locate the long-lost diary. This eccentric country girl, who got hold of the diary, is interested in legends and considers herself a ""woman of the world."" She may have the skills to de-code the diary -- so Jared ...waits...While it's an interesting plot, I thought more could have been done with the details of the legend, the ancient objects that were referred to, and the treasure itself. Most of the story revolves around Jared playing tutor to her 3 nephews. There was no 'treasure hunt.' A fun light read, if you're in the mood for something cute & different."
4,A Very Nice Change,"I've been reading Regency romances on and off for the past two years (I'm a graduate student and they give my brain the break it deserves). It was getting to the point when every time I saw the word ""ton,"" my teeth were set on edge. Like many of the erstwhile characters of romance novels, I was sick of Society!It was with great relief that I began reading ""Deception."" A fine book and a fine plot with lots of great sex (in libraries!), but also, as other reviewers have mentioned, a nice family atmosphere thanks to Olympia's nephews. Only one ball, towards the end of the book, and not dwelt on over much. In short, characters that can find plenty to do, even in London, rather than subjecting themselves and the readers to boring and trivial gossip. This is only my second Quick -- I can't believe I waited two years to try her again. One thing is for sure. I won't be making that mistake again any time soon!"
1,A complete waste of time for US developers,"I completely agree with the reviewer that mentions the book is very Euro-centric. For domenstic developers, what's needed is coverage of Openwave browsers and HDML migration. Try ""Dynamic WAP application Development"" instead -- it's a nice reference to issues significant to the U.S. market."
1,Find something appropriate for North America,"Any WAP book that only tests code on Nokia and Ericsson handsets is completely misguided. Worldwide, a vast majority of handsets contain browsers from Openwave (formerly Phone.com). Any one writing real WAP applications needs to ensure that they run well on these handsets. We're talking about Motorola, Siemens, Samsung, Alcatel, Phillips, Sanyo, Denso, LG, etc, etc, etc..."
4,seems something missing,"I love Charles Bronson, so I was excited to order this movie. It plays same as when it was on television. That's fine with me, I would rather have it like that. The ending scene seemed to be missing. It just stopped and went to the end. That was very disappointing, esp. w this one. That should never happen. I'm keeping it though. I should've asked for return or refund. Didn't ask and that's ok now."
2,"Feedback from Real Apache ""Calculus Wiz""","I saw a few scenes and couldn't even continue watching. I like a lot of Charles Bronson's movies. Examples include ""Death Hunt,"" the 80s ""Death Wish"" series, and ""the White Buffalo."" But his acting in this movie is unrealistic. He does not act like a real Apache. Bronson seems to overdo it on being ""stoic."" A relative and I watched a few scenes and just switched channels. Bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real Apache. Paul Newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an Apache-raised white man in ""Hombre,"" which I purchased on Amazon. I do applaud Bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the Apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s. Given the time period, perhaps Bronson should have hired Roman Gabriel instead. He does a realistic job of portraying a Cherokee Indian in the ""Undefeated,"" which was also released around the same time (give or take a couple of years)."
5,Two Versions?,"Are there two versions of this movie. The cable western channel version is longer and shows more of the violence and nudity. The DVD I bought excludes the nudity and some of the violence, blood and killing. What's up??"
2,A review of the DVD not the Movie!,"Very disappointing transfer! It was very badly washed out, grainy, overly dark and looked like an old VHS recording off the TV. It played VERY badly on my blu-ray player (the picture quality). This DVD reminds me of the movies small stations buy from the studios on the cheap and used to broadcast late at night. There's also the fact that this movie was badly censored. That sux!I'm glad I bought this used; I would have been pissed if I bought it new at full price!"
3,"Droning, minimalist, cerebral, jazzy introspective vocals","In which a fairly talented female vocalist tells the world just what she thinks about putting her career on hold to raise the kids she had by her ex-husband, even though she still kind of has a crush on him or someone very much like him. The New York Times loved this album, and there are a few good cuts (for example, ""Safe"" and ""Tho""). I plan to leave this CD in the office, next to Barber ""Adagio for Strings"" and Kronos Quartet ""Four by Philip Glass"" and a few others, for those nights when I need to stay calm and focused and get a lot of work done."
3,Cheap & Flimsy,I bought the license plate frames because of the price. They look okay but are really cheap / thin metal. The worst part of that is the holes for the screws can break off when tightening the screws. I had three break - different tabs break even when trying to gently tighten so beware. Apart from that - they look nice when mounted.
3,I liked it,"Unlike the other reviewer out there, I found this to be a very interesting book. Mystery stories are not the easiest genre and I found this to be an very good effort for a first time writer. The end was a little bit of a let down, as we never knew much about the killer. I had definite feelings about many of the characters and found them to be realistic people, some likeable, some not. I would have liked to know more about some of them, the mother, for instance. Ms Snowden has an exceptional knack for the descriptive. Many times I could see vivid mental pictures of her scenes. The story itself is believable. I have personally witnessed the type of back door race relationships depicted in this story. All in all I would highly recommend this book. I get the feeling this is not her best writing, but I most certainly see indications of the potential for a very promising writer."
2,help,"help, i have one day to read this book, and if anybody see's this that has read the book please send me a summary of the book so i will not have to spend so much of my time today. I will love you all if you do this for me. Please email me at baa1313@aol.com"
1,Junk-Literature,The book is boring. Even when you are at the Beach in San Diego. Staring at the sun is much more inspiring.
3,Must . . . save . . . brain . . .from . . . self-destruction,"I really hope this novel wasn't meant to be taken seriously, because after reading the first 5 chapters I could have written the rest of the novel. Here's the pattern: Beautiful woman is in danger, Dirk Pitt arrives, Dirk Pitt almost gets killed, but manages to crawl back from the brink of death to save beautiful woman and loyal companions from evil supervillain. Repeat until you've reached 600 pages of brainless, pointless action."
1,Enjoyed Cussler more in my teens,"I was an avid Cussler fan until I turned about sixteen. Now, at 28, I realize that I was too young to know any better! Cussler writes the most awkward, stilted dialogue imaginable. The historical diatribes by the archaeologists Kelsey and Rodgers, while interesting, read more like an encyclopedia article than a piece of dialogue. And the ubiquitous English/metric conversions throughout the book become tiresome in the extreme. (Pitt: ""That boat is about 200 feet away."" Giordino: ""Gee, Dirk, that's over 60 meters!"") Good escapism/bathroom reading type stuff. Buy it for your kids - at least it beats Nintendo."
2,pathetic,"Granted, I'm not into action books, but I am an anthroplogist/archaeologist. This is the most rediculous book! The beginning was good and very actuarate about Incas and archaeology (for example, the in situ speech about needing to find artifacts where they are originally located) but... I had to put the book away when a cia team of anthropologists entered the plot. Give me a break, people with PhDs being foreign spies. That's so laughable. Yes, I can just see my Yale-educated dowdy professor dashing off to Pakistan, Chad, or Peru to infultrate and destroy. Rolling on the floor here. This is the most pathetic book I've seen in a long time."
3,"""Good, But Needed More Adventure""","An international relic smuggling syndicate is the target for Dirk Pitt & Co. in this offering from Clive Cussler. Starts out very well with an incredible rescue and escape from a sacrifical pool in Peru. As soon as that's wrapped up, Pitt, old buddy Al Giordino and a group of researchers must fight for their lives against sadistic mercenary Tupac Amaru. Great fight scene. Unfortunately, the middle of the book tends to slow down. Not as much adventure that I've come to expect from Cussler. The battle on the ferry made up for it. So did the end in the underground river. That was classic Pitt in the impossible situation. The villians were OK, but nowhere near the classic bad guys from ""Sahara."""
5,It was the most exciting book I have ever read.,"Inca Gold is probably the best book I ever read. I am a fan of Indiana Jones type quests. This book is the mother of all treasure hunts with tons of action and suspense to keep you going. Read this book and you will have to read them all, It's that good!"
2,Predictable and improbable,"Yes, I found it exciting to read. Yes, it kept me reading and going back for more. But is it good? No. It is a sad state of affairs that this book can be thought of as worthy of the trees it killed in order to br published. Pitt is too mythical to identify with and the storyline is too predictable to make me want to actually buy a Dark Pitt book (this one was given to me, thankfully.) I guess it is a good read if you've read every other book in the world first."
1,"If this was a movie, I would have demanded my money back!","I cannot see how so many people have gotten hooked on this guy's writing. It is obviously geared to juvenile tastes (and I have no problem with that), but he is being sold as a 'serious' writer. Predictable plot, predictable characters, predictable outcome. Boring!"
1,inca gold,"I never thought I would find a Cussler book I didn't like but Inca Gold is awful. It runs all over the place. There are about 3-4 plots all scrambled up in one. I gave up at 300 pages because I lost all interest. I can't say I gave up early, but I gave up on a Cussler."
5,Ignore most of the reviews,"Why do you read a book of fiction? Hopefully for enjoyment! Let the mind unload away from a tv. Too many of these reviewers seem to forget that. This book, and all in the series are excellent escapes to a world of action and wonder. Think of escaping to different areas around the globe, and always coming out the hero! That's what you get from Cussler's books. He peels away the blandness of life and gives you a kick in the rear! I'd hate to see people miss out on his works because of some of these reviews. Entertaining fiction rarely gets better."
4,Solid Dirk Pitt Adventure,"Inca Gold is the third Dirk Pitt novel by Clive Cussler I've read and doesn't disappoint. The prologue is excellent setting the table for the suspense and mystery to follow. The action in the middle keeps moving, never bogging down and offering romance, deception, and betryal. And, the ending, though slightly predictable, pays-off.If you enjoy Cussler's other Dirk Pitt novels, you'll love this one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is the only Cussler book I think I have read, because a friend had it while I was staying at their house for a while. Anyone, there are archaelogical adventures, kidnapping, now you have it, now you don't treasures, dodgy people who seem ok, and of course a decent sort of a woman to be rescued and be charmed."
4,"See for your self, this book is GOLD!","Well, I basicaly got the book and threw it aside for about a year. I am horrified I did. It started slow, but the action really started when TUPAC AMARU get shot in a very painful spot. He then swears vengence on DIRK PITT(who crippled him.)Soon, they discover a lost horde of INCA GOLD(hence the name.)So read it and get carried away into the depths of the SINKHOLE in INCA GOLD!"
3,Good Action,"This was the first book by this author that I have read and I may not be reading any more. A fried of mine suggested I read it. The book was enjoyable enough, lots of action and a very interesting location with good detail. I guess I was just looking for a little deeper type of book. This is one of those action books that does not take a lot of effort to read and keeps your attention all the way through. All and all an above average book."
1,What an awful book,"First book by this man. Last book by this man. Doesn't anyonerealize that this man CANNOT write? The situations he puts Dirk Pottin are just plain silly. Do you remember the books from a few yearsage starring a character known as 'Doc Savage'? Similar ... of thatstyle. (Also, I can figure out how to convert metric to the USstandard as well as he can. I don't need to be hit over the head withit on each page)."
2,A series in need of new ideas.,"Mr Cussler's books have all the ingredients of typical escapist literature; romance, adventure, action, exotic locations and so on. If you only look for entertainment and your expectations are not too high you will have a good time reading one of his books. The problem arises when you pick up a second one. You will have the impression of having read the book already. You'll find a prologue set in the past telling some maritime disaster, and will encounter Pitt, Giordino ,Admiral Sandecker and one resourceful woman (not necessarily Loren Smith) in the future. Between incredible rescues and unbelievable chases you will have a break in between to visit Dirk's hangar in Washington DC and enjoy a ride on one of the models of his car collection. The car is different each time as well as the villain or evil corporation our heroes fight against. But that's it!. Inca Gold is no different than the others. But highly enjoyable if this is your first Cussler novel."
1,Juvenile writing style,"I kept looking for the illustrations to go along with the prose in this Hardy Boy's style children's adventure book. Based on some of the comments in these reviews, his audience is obviously the same audience that reads and enjoys comic book drama. Luckily I did not pay too much for it. Terrible book!"
3,"Really good for some,...but not for me","I recently read Atlantis Found and I think Inca Gold is much better. Yes, Pitt is still the superman Indiana Jones and of course him and his almost equally superhuman girlfriend save the day. But this time the bad guy was just someone who had a billion dollar operation in the illegal antique buisness and had nothing to do with nazi's. Now this bad guy I can deal with, and this book I actually finished so hey it is an improvement. This book may be great for some readers, but it is not for me. I think i will give up on this arthur for a while until I run out of books to read. But if you are a Pitt fan I would say this is one of the better ones."
5,Great Book,"As always, Clive Cussler does it again with a good, page turning read. I have loved every one of his novels, so far. I tried the non-fiction and found them interesting, but not nearly as much fun and exciting as his fictional books."
3,Inca Gold,"Book is not bad. I want to make a small comment on the accuracy of the information. For the fun of using the metric syste, Mr. Cussler provides all linear and square measurements in metric units -that is meters, kilometers and so on. That is not bad from educational side. The problem is that Mr. Cussler simply multiplies all measures by the same factor even if he speaks about areas. 400 square kilometers are not equal to 250 sq. miles as he thinks (400/1.6 = 250) but 156.25 sq. miles. because if linear mile is 1.6 km, the square mile is 2.56 sq. kilometers......"
2,"Flat writing, by the numbers plot, boring hero","This is one of the dullest ""thrillers"" I've ever encountered. Friends tell me that Cussler is usually better, but I doubt I'll take a crack at another one of his books."
5,One of the greatest in the history of adventure novels,"You can experience the touch of the author, transfered by Dirk Pitt, taking it with you into your mind. And when you are sitting behind your desk in the office again, the cold Swedish weather outside, you remember the adventures of Dirk, wishing you would be him"
5,The Best Cussler Book I Have Read,"I will start off by saying I have read every one of Mr. Cussler's novels and througly enjoyed every o0ne of them. But, in INCA GOLD, Cussler out does himself with his charaters, plot, etc. The people who have read his books and did not like them obviously have some sort of chemical imbalance in their brain. How can you not like this book?"
1,Within 3 centimeters (1 inch) of strangling Cussler,"I see no other mention of it in the other reviews, but CC's constant hammering at the reader that the US doesn't conform to the world's measurement standard really got on my nerves. With every (and he made sure there were more than were needed) mention of measurement in centimeters, meters and kilometers, he made sure that there was a parenthesized 'US' measurement as well. This could have been more effectively done the first couple of times measurements were a requirement and then simply give the measurement in whatever discipline he wants to, or have an appendix with the conversions at the back of the book. Also, running into this character 'Clive Cussler' cooking hamburgers in the desert.. (what's that all about)?!? I've read this book and 'Sahara' (a few years ago - long enough to forget his style), but I think I'm done with him now..."
2,GOOD rating is only an adequate with other sellers,"Great packaging and delivery but book condition should have been rated as adequate as the spine was broken, several pages (over 20) were loose and the first fourth of the book had water damage. This book was overpriced for its condition. Be leery of their rating system."
3,A Great Unbelievable Adventure!,This was an entertaining read and a nice diversion. I was given this book to read by my mother in-law along with several others by Clive Cussler. I am easily drawn in by anything with an archaeological or historical theme and this seemed to fit. This book remained well researched with a decent amount of over the top action to keep you interested. I'm sure I will be borrowing more from her as she purchases all of the Dirk Pitt books. Great for anyone who likes adventure books
3,"very long, drawn out saga","My biggest criticism of this book is its excessive length. The story could have been told in half the pages, with no loss of content. Pitt endures unimaginable pain in a series of Peruvian and Mexican adventures to save the lost Incan treasure from landing in the hands of James Bond-like bad guys (which seemed much like the Christopher Walken character in ""A View to a Kill""). Along the way, Pitt's girlfriend, the congresswoman, gets kidnapped, and some interesting helicopter action occurs. After you have read a few Cussler adventures, they start to become ho-hum, unfortunately. If this was your first Pitt adventure, I'm sure you will love it."

3,Review of Poppy by Michael Lanzone,"It was exciting in the beginning and got even more exciting in the end. I would recommend this book to fourth graders and up. If you like adventure and mystery this is the book for you.Sincerely,Michael Lanzone"
5,Poppy ignors the dangers of owls.,"A young mouse named Poppy keeps gettig lecturs on how the owl pertects them from porky pines and other critters, but on a walk one night with Raweed her boy friend they ventur out of mouse teritory. The owl that said he was protecting the mice swoopes down and grabbes and killes Raweed. With winter coming the mice were running out of food. Poppy disided to take charge.

2,The Worst Book EVER!!,"This book was sooooooooooooooo boring i hated it, it made nooooooooooooo sence and was hard to understand. I got to page 35 or so and quit reading it. IT'S THE MOST BORINEST THING IN THE WORLD!"
1,Can't Stand the PAIN!!!,"Why does Ragweed has to die? Why? Why?!!! I WANT RAGWEED BACK!!!! I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH THIS BOOK WHEN I HAD TO PUT IT DOWN. RAGWEED LOVERS, DON'T READ THIS BOOK OF HORROR!!!"
1,If you like suspence then read this book.,I read the book Poppy. It was about a mouse and an owl in the woods. If the mice went by a certain part in the woods the owl would eat him. Letter in the story. Poppy wanted to run away because her boyfriend Was eaten by the owl. Poppy wanted to get revenge on the owl and the owl was trying really hard to eat Poppy. Poppy found many more characters The owl said if you go passed a certain part in the woods a porcupine will eat you. Later in the story Poppy found one and said we don't eat mice so the whole time the Owl was lying
5,Looking for a Great Book,"The book Poppy is one of the most hilarious, exciting, and thought provoking stories you will ever read. Funny characters such as a grumpy porcupine named Ereth, and a bumbling mouse named Lungwort will keep you laughing all the way through. There is also a lot of action in the book. In one part the main character, Poppy, who is a small mouse must fight a big, mean owl with only a sharp porcupine quill as a weapon. This book also has a great moral about the importance of thinking for one's self instead of always believing what others say. Overall, Poppy is a very entertaining book, and you won't want to put it down."
4,Other great book,"Poppy is a very intriquing book of adventure, most of which are considered by mice, and an old grumpy porcupine. Well, the main drift of the story is Poppy, a young mouse decides to leave her family, and make her own life in the forest, which most of her family objects to, but she still goes. While she is out in the forest she has to be aware of owls, and the many other different animals that would try to make her a meal, while she is trying to find a home at the same(which turns to be a very difficult task). Later in the story she meets a grumpy porcupine named, Erith and at first he won't be her friend at all and avoided her, but later it turns out they become very good friends! Well to make it so you don't know the ending of the story it all ends about as happy as a mouse, and a grumpy porcupine can be..."
2,Very basic technician stuff,"This is a low level, descriptive introduction to the business. After the first few days of making display measurements, I've not needed this book again. Borrow it from a library for a week."
2,Lack of In depth technical knowledge,The first few chapters take you smoothly with concepts of display systems and color science. But the later chapters are really boring with most of the test procedures too archaic and applicable only to CRT systems. If you looking for something to test and measure your latest display devices including plasma or lcd or oled this book is nowhere going to solve your even basic doubts. Highly disappointed the lousy way the book deals with advanced topics. Only for undergraduate or very first course in display testing.Suchit ShahTest & Measurement - Nanotechnology
3,"Good SciFi, but a little long winded.","Good book. Although the subject is a little far fetched it was probably more believable than most SciFi.The author is a little to preoccupied with sex, but he did do a good job of giving the reader an idea of the main characters emotional state.If I have ever read a book crying for a sequel this is it."
3,Liked it,"First, I'd like to remind anyone who was turned off by the first review here to remember that it was written by a nine year old. I personally wouldn't let my 9 nine year old read this book in the first place...That said, it does get a little graphic, in most every way. I think, comparable to Stephen King. (I wonder how many nine-year olds read his books...) If you like King and Sci-Fi you're bound to love this. Except for a few technical excerpts, most of the writing is slightly dumbed down. It almost read like a screenplay. If it weren't for Leininger's amazing ability to enable the reader to relate to the character's it would have gotten boring, but I thought the plot was exciting and enthralling. Also, forget a sequel, how about a movie?! It would be perfect.Oh yeah, you can't judge ANY book in 20 pages."
4,"Very good, once you get through the first 20, or so, pages.","The first 20, or so, pages are boring. I almost put the book aside. My wife said that it got better, if I could bear with it, so I did. It did improve after that."
2,He's too cowardly of a Writer,"I read this book, and I am not impressed. The story was horrible and the main character seemed like a coward. Yes, when I read this book, I could tell the writer was obsessed with sex. He probably sexually harasses his students in his 3rd,4th and 5th period math classes. Overall, I give it 1.8 stars."
4,Excellent for an indi horror flick,"Watched this the other day, and I enjoyed it a lot. No, it's not some $60,000,000 Hollywood movie, but that's not what it's trying to be. As far as found footage movies go, it's solid. Some of the deaths and scares could be tightened up a bit, but overall it presents a realistically creepy atmosphere and a solid story.This movie would have made millions of dollars if it had been released before Paranormal Activity. But, as it is, it's a solid found footage movie.4 stars. Would watch again."
4,Prefer DK Ultimate Visual Dictionary of Science,"This book is exactly the same as the chemistry chapter in DK's Ultimate Visual Dictionary of Science (the chemistry useful data section is at the very end of book). If you only want the chemistry section, then this book is a good purchase. If you would prefer to get physics, chemistry, life sciences and ecology, human anatomy, medical science, earth sciences, astronomy and astrophysics, electronics and computer science, and mathematics chapters, then you would probably prefer to purchase DK's Ultimate Visual Dictionary of Science. Also, the Dictionary of Science is not as tall as the individual book of DK Chemistry, which is very tall and doesn't fit on our shelves."
4,masterpiece from australia!!!,make me think about donnie darko!!! one of the track is in the movie(under the milky way)!!!! great album underated
4,"Evocative, dreamy","Captures an ambient guitar-gestalt that seems to be about adolescence and early adulthood. The Church have been one of my favorite bands since 'The Unguarded Moment' in the 80's. They strike me as artists who are not particularly interested in commercial success or what the listeners think about them. This is both very good and a little bit bad. It's very good in that it's allowed them to really explore and develop their own sound, which is often very beautiful. It's a little bit bad in that they can at times show a tendency toward self-indulgence. We can all learn something here."
5,This album ROCKS ... 110 Percent!!,"If you've listened to Eiffel 65 or haven't ... you should definitley pick up this album because the songs on here areamazing. Lets just say I went out to get this cd, listenedto it and as I listen to it more, totally grows on me!I've listened to it so much, the songs are just great.One of the type's of music, I would never get sick.Sorry to say but I think Euro-Dance is way better thensome American music like Britney or N-Sync(...)!Not to offend any Americans, I don't thinkAmerican music is the best plus it's more rock orientatedcompared to the variety of music you can get in Europe.There are fast, slow and songs with an awesome beat!I recommend: Lucky (In my life), New Life, I Dj with the fire,Crazy, Morning Time, Life like thunder, losing you, Journeyand World in the world. So if you want some different dancemusic, with great style... go pick up Contact, you won't regretit!"
4,DJ with the Fire,"I enjoy the the songs ""I DJ with the Fire"", ""People of Tomorrow"", ""Life Like Thunder"". Those particular songs have an upbeat that you can't stop listening to. It keeps you going throughout the day if you're tired. I recommend you listen to them while driving. I've listened to their 3rd CD. I can't understand the itallian on most of the songs. I hope they come out with a 4th CD and release it in the US unlike the 3rd album. Anyways, dance the night away!"
3,Sophomore slump.,"""Contact"", Eiffel 65's second cd is just a plain rehash of their first cd. In fact, a number of times during the cd I'd swear I heard the exact same riffs they used on their first cd. With so many more sophisticated electronic bands like New Order, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Erasure, SNAP, etc., Eiffel 65 have a ways to go. Still, they do have some catchy synth-pop songs like ""Lucky In My Life"", ""Crazy"", ""One Goal"" and ""King Of Lullaby"". 17 songs is a bit much though. 10 would have done just fine. There's nothing like being excessive. It becomes repetitive and overwhelming to the listener. I sure hope Eiffel 65 change their sound on their next cd, if they have another cd. Otherwise, I can see them falling through the cracks like many 80's new wave bands did."
1,Ew!,"This CD is SO corny. I bought it on an impulse, thinking it would be like their first cd, but better. At least their first CD had an edge of seriousness. This just sounds like someone wrote it for a children's TV show. I think the worst was One Goal. The entire song they sang the two words ""one goal"" with fake strings and the cheesiest melody that sounded a lot like Blue. I sold the CD to a friend the day I bought it."
1,Music was great! CD was bad!,"I hate to have rated this CD so badly.. The music on it was simply awesome.. I hope they keep making the music.. it's The CD what was the problem.. I had to go to my CAR to listen to the CD.. it has the new CD copy protection.. bieng that BMG is the record company.. it doens't play on a COMPUTER, it doesn't even WANT to come CLOSE to playing.. the playstation 2 will play all but the FIRST track.. and I listen to ALL my music on my computer.. if this is the way music is going.. it's going to [be awful]...."
1,"Too bad I can't play it, I'd probably rate it ""five stars"".","I absolutely loved Europop, so I naturaly was excited to receive my copy of ""Contact"". However, just before I unwrapped it I noticed a note that said that it ""Can't be played on computers"". The only CD player I have is in my computer. Apparently this is some type of copywrite protection device. Brilliant marketing move, lock out half of all the potential play back devices. I believe in paying for my music, but now I've wasted time, money (return shipping fee) and still don't have the music."
5,another good album by expose,"what you don't know is another good album by expose. the songs what you don't know,when i looked at him, tell me why,walk along with me, your baby never looked good in blue,and let me down easy are very good songs. check out the two bonus remixes at the end,you will like them. ed wilson"
4,I know this album rocks!,"This is definitely an album for Expose fans. Their initial release, ""Exposure"" was a hit, but this album actually has better songs. The title track is ok, but I prefer their mellow ballads, ""Your Baby Never Looked Good In Blue"" and ""When I Looked At Him"". Both are sweet tunes with a bit of sentimentality, and sorrow as well. Jeannette Jurado definitely has a knack for singing ballads, and she has to be my favorite member of the group. However, all three do a fairly good job of harmonizing in their tracks, and the album as a whole is solid. It's a few more hits shy of making it a five-star album for me, but then again, I think I tend to be more critical about scoring albums on Amazon than many others."
2,mediocre album,"I have to admit that when the title song came out in 1989, I really loved it. I also loved ""When I looked at him"". The entire album,however, does not have the same hooks as the first album. The entire first album was able to hook me from the beginning. The two songs that I just mentioned before are the only two songs that I like on ""What You Don't Know"". ""It Echoes Every Night"" is also a great song."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I love this band but only because of the catchy songs and because of Ann. I think she has a really great voice. She doesn't sing on most of these tracks though, and the girl that does has a very mediocre voice. They should have let her sing more. The only songs I really liked were ""Tell Me Why"" and ""Your Baby Never Looked Good in Blue."""
2,"INFERIOR COLLECTION OF OBSCURE, DATED WRITING","This is merely an old book scanned and reprinted. Type is compressed and unclear.Selections are dated, obscure and inferior in quality.If you love Mencken, buy Chrestomathy, his own collection of his writings."
3,Prejudices,Some of the material in this book is excellent and Mencken is obviously a brilliant author. But most of the material in this book concerns obscure people or obscure events from his time (100 years ago) and his comments are meaningless today. If all of that irrelevant material could be eliminated the book would be one tenth the size and great fun to read.
1,Beware of Sizing,The size indicated is incorrect.The Warn 22681 disconnect is a 50 amp connector (not 175 amp as the description states).The correct item number for the 175 amp disconnect is 22680 which is designed for 2ga - 4ga cables.** There is also a item #65707 on amazon which is also the 175 amp connector. I don't know why Warn used a differant number.As for the product itself I have no issues. There are pricey but make things alot easier.Once they correct the listing I will delete this review. It is only there to get a persons attention as it is 1 star.
1,Same as the other guy,Item is not the rite size. Also pagkage it came says Warn the plug it's self says SMH. There fore It isnt even the same Brand as stated in the item description. The picter given is from the opposite side or bottom of the plug that has SMH stamped on it. This seller is missleading and a cheat. Do not buy this or any other item from this seller.
4,The Wells you should know,"This book is completely modern, maybe because Wells always seemed to haveone foot in the future and one in the past. He had a good feel for thescope of history past and history to be made. But it should also be pointedout what a fine writer and stylist Wells was. The book is beautifullywritten. The prose flows. I always loved this about his works of ScienceFiction, the ones most people know about, but it is even more apparent inthis mature work of literature. Read Tono Bungay for the music of hiswords, as well as the truth of the emotions, and the intelligence of theideas. Like Jules Verne, who also wrote more than his well-known ScienceFiction works, Wells really needs to be re-discovered as a fine generalnovelist. Reading Tono Bungay was my first step in that re-discovery.Now I'm off to read others."
1,Failed on my computer,Stop responed in 10 minutes. dont know what's going on. I brought a PNY 7900GS instead and that one works >_<
5,Quite possibly the best thing ever,"After hearing Party Hard on MTV2 and getting it stuck in my head, I decided to get a few mp3s of Andrew WK to see if the rest of his stuff was any good. I was over an hour late in for work the following morning due to me HAVING to go in to town and buy up everything I could find. Nothing has excited me musically like this in years. And of all the songs I have heard so far, the greastest is hidden away in the middle of this EP. Listening to We Want Fun is quite simply the most enjoyment I've had in ages, I just play it on repeat mode, jamming along with my guitar, bouncing around and grinning like a maniac with a bag of happy pills.Put simply, there is nothing better for sale on this website. Forget your Xboxes, Gamecubes and widescreen projection TVs, and get this disc. Now!"
1,Horrible,"Not even getting out of the second chapter I've run across more than a dozen typos and other errors. If I had known there were so many I would have marked them all and sent them to the publisher. Some topics are not even covered. I have thrown this book away and bought the Sybex 70-290 study guide instead...Sybex Study Guides are the best I've found.If you want to learn this information correctly, do NOT use this book. Their technical editor should be fired."
3,DECENT.........JUST OKAY,"Even though Janet is my favorite Jackson of them all, Rebbie is the only one out of the three sisters that can really sing. Her style of course differs from her two younger sisters. Rebbie never portrayed the sexy side of herself like her sisters but concentrated more on her vocal ability. She doesn't have the best singing voice like Mariah or Whitney but she can surely sing. This album delivers tunes about love in every way whether it's fast, mid-tempo, or slow grooves. Even though she would be considered a one hit wonder with her hit ""Centipede"", Rebbie released about 4 albums overall, which none of the albums really made a dent on the charts. Rebbie is talented, but maybe if she had gotten the right promotion in her singing career, Michael and Janet wouldn't have been the only 2 Jacksons to make it big."
4,Dramatization of actual history,"I must say that this book is a good read because of the dramtization of the events. It is difficult to accept that everything written is correct but one thing for sure, the facts about the location of the various units as well as the key commanders are true. For me this is good enough. If you want only truth, read a doctoral thesis on the subject."
1,Infantry Aces,"This book is one-sided and doesn't say anything about the person, the German Soldier. It is a list of accomplishments, although the bravery was outstanding, there is nothing about the individual."
1,Terrible,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read, period. It was ""we shoot them, they shoot us"". No human side to it at all. I looked for something like ""Taught to Kill"" by John B. Babcock, which I think is one of the best books written about war.. I wanted to know what was going through their minds, what they did to keep warm, what they felt about the war, what they felt about the enemy, etc. Maybe it got better and if it did it was my loss."
5,Loved It !,"This is the companion book to Panzer Aces, which I must admit I did like a little better than this one. Never the less, this is a great book that describes hundreds of encounters, both small and large in a very exciting and intersting fashion. It is now one of my favorites."
5,Amazing,"I have wanted to dig into this book for quite a while. It was well worth the wait. The stories are astounding and if you enjoy reading about the war, you will enjoy it also."
5,"Progressive, mystic, irresistable jazz","This album has a grittier, more progressive sound than Le pas du chat noir, but I have found that the euro influence adds a pleasing edge to the mystic quality of the jazz. I an a huge fan of all his music, and this CD is one of my favorites. The sound is alluring and irresistable."
5,simply tasteful,It's not much to say. The album is extrodenary mixing of afro-arabian music style with litlle touch of jazz. Greate!
3,Chic sheik shake,"3 1/2Walking a line between authenticity and cross-cultured accessibility well, Brahem rides to maximum transportive effect with some well-intentioned pandering."
3,Too Ethnic Middle East For My Tastes,"The musicianship on Astrakan Cafe is world class. With Barbaros Erköse on clarinet and Lassad Hosni on bendir and darbouka the sound is certainly authentic and the material is very traditional Middle East ethnic. If you find that sound palatable then you will certainly love this CD. I just couldn't 'get into' the music. For me it was too ethnic. This is a matter of my personal taste and not reflective of the performance. The musicians perform the material at the very highest level.However, I can recommend another Anouar Brahem CD, 'Le Pas Du Chat Noir'. The musicians playing with Brahen are Francois Couturier and Jean-Louis Matinier on accordion and piano. The music strongly retains Middle East influences but is more creative, more beautiful, more harmonious, less ethnic."
3,I miss Earth 2,"I really liked the TV show and sorely miss it. I am therefore ever grateful to the few authors who have written anything on the show, hence the extra star. It is only really a 2 star book, Vornholt has done better before and worse! Out of all the Earth 2 books out there, I personally prefer the Sean Dalton novel Puzzle because he has the characters right. Earth 2 : Leather Wings by Vornholt is an okay book. The colonists arrive at an enormous canyon which stretches as far as the eye can see in either direction. Way down below a river rages. Somehow they must find a way across."
5,Great book!,"I bought this book because I wanted to (at minimum) figure out what is so great about football that it captivates my husband's attention for 21 entire weekends of the year. (If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right?!) Holly Robinson Peete does a great job explaining the game in a way that is interesting and relevant to the average non-sports-minded woman. Surprisingly, the NFL is replete with the kind of drama, strategy, cute men, and cattiness that you'd find on primetime TV. A couple of the chapters could have been ommitted (she devotes quite a lot of text to discussing what it's like to be a quarterback's wife). Overall, very informative and will help you understand what's going on when you watch a game. Plus, she provides a lot of trivia that you can use to quiz your guy and ultimately feel smarter."
5,Greatest football book ever,It's so easy to understand the game with this book. I like the history as well as the explanations. It makes football easier to watch and a more pleasant experience all-around. Great book ! Easy to follow and a terrific reference guide...
3,Football?,"Thought this book was going to be more about football, and not what Holly Robinson Peete's life around football was about. Ladies interested in the sport would have been better served to choose a different book."
4,HUMOR AND INFORMATIVE,"I INITALLY PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT,THEN DECIDED TO KEEP AND READ MYSELF.STORIES ARE LIGHTHEARTED, VERY IMFORMATIVE. WORTH THE PRICE.I DO NOT GIVE ANY BOOK 4 STARS UNLESS IT MAKES THE NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER LIST."
1,upset,"I WAS charged and I never received my order, and I emailed the seller asking about it and never got a response."
4,Great for people who know nothing about football,Some gave her poor reviews but I think it's designed for those that want to learn(not know EVERYTHING) about football. Just to enjoy the game. I don't think she designed this for people who already know about football. I enjoyed reading and learned alot.
5,It's About Time,"This is such a great book to have on the market! There are many, many women who already appreciate the game of football, and those who have a real desire to learn more about it. This book breaks it down in a way that is easy to understand and fun to read. Bravo Mrs. Robinson-Peete!"
4,amazing photographs,"For those of us who love castles, this book is essential. Though all photographs are black-and-white, this doesn't detract from the magnificence of these architectural wonders. In fact, the monochrome enhances details. What also sets this book apart from others is that the camera angles are at eye-level, thus making the scene more intimate, not so artsy."
5,This film is great!,"I love this film! I'm a little biased as I'm a coaster enthusiast and there aren't that many decent coaster films around, but this really is good! The suspense is great, the soundtrack is cheesy fairground - which is great and it just personifies the 70's to me. I'd love to ride some of the coasters in the film, but living in the UK makes it hard! If you love cheesy 70's thrillers such as Earthquake, Towering Inferno, etc. then this is another ""must see"" for you."
2,B...b.......bbbb.......boy,"Saw this on the same day as Star Wars. Not a lot of people know that. How many times can you listen to the chorus of 'Big Boy' and not pull your hair out? How did the bomb squad manage to defuse the device? ""BIG BOY! BIG BOY!"" They need to cut the wire but instead they want to shake their fist. Did you know 'Big Boy' by Sparks is at least ten minutes long and has thirty chorus reprises? Not a lot of people know that either. Next time put the bomb under the stage, Timmy."
2,"This film should have been a ""made-for-TV-movie"".","I must admit the only reason I bought the DVD of this film is because I was an extra in it and 22 years old at the time.The script is written by Link and Levinson the guys that brought us many TV series (i.e. Mannix and Colombo). It was directed by James Goldstone who happened to have directed the original pilot for the original Star Trek series.All in all it is not a bad film, it would have been better suited as a made-for-TV-movie. When I first saw it in the theater with Sensurround it really made me feel as though I was riding a rollercoaster. Unfortunately you don't get the same effect from the home video version as Sensurround is not included on the soundtrack.The DVD is well presented but the only disappointment to me is the sound is in mono Dolby Digital which makes no sense to me. Otherwise it is typical of most DVDs in its presentation of a film. If you like disaster and/or suspense films this will be a good addition to your collection."
5,Rollercoaster Terror,"It's more of a Scary Summer-July 4th movie. It has Helen Hunt as Steven Segal's daughter,Harry Caulder is a safety inspector,who goes to investigate the now defunct Ocean View Amusement Park.someone put a bomb on the rollercoaster,and it was a young man.It also stars Henry Fonda as Steven Segal's boss.He also strikes at another park,but in a dark ride,nobody was hurt in that ride.He also strikes at Six Flags Magic Mountain,still open and Six Flags Great Domain or something like that."
4,Battle of the Middle Aged Egos,"This movie is often bunched into the other 70's disaster movies, but it is not. The best part of this film is George Segal. He's the 70's anti-hero. Smokin' cigars, and dealing with difficult upper management. He has this perpetual frazzled and exasperated attitude, which is unduplicable. Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, they're all great, even in small roles.I would rent this movie with Coma for a Richard Widmark double feature."
4,Still listenin' seven years later,"This is a quality album that has stood the test of time in my music collection. I would recommend it to anyone who likes progressive, but fun, rock, en francais, bien-sur."
3,"Decent and a good idea, but still has room for improvement","The layout of the of the incrementation is very good and better than other tapes. I have not compared accuracy, though.The awkward thing is that yes it's big enough so you can jot numbers down on the front but it's a bit bulky. I wish it had a slot for a pencil since it's so big, at least a small one and it's housing is not going to survive many falls, so it's still a little gimicky unless you could really use it for writing down a lot of measurements. The rub and erase does work."
1,Watch your fingers,"tend to retrack on its own with brute force, it hurts mad if you don't let go quick."
3,iLok a necessary evil,"The iLok is a hardware dongle on which you load license files, which you can then move from computer to computer as simply as unplugging and plugging in a USB device. This is obviously useful any time you have the same software on more than one computer, and yet are required to have a unique license to use it.We've had one about a month -- it works fine so far. Setting up an account, registering the software, and downloading the license to the iLok device was not complex and only took a few minutes.It's a shame there's a market for this device, and it's a shame you have to buy it, but it gives software publishers the peace of mind that people using their software have valid licenses. I'll castigate the publishers anyway for making me pay a third-party provider to use software that's already too expensive. I'll think twice about buying iLok-dependent software again."
2,What A Rip,"I bought software that required the ilok and wasn't even told this until I tried to load it on my computer. The ilok site is hard to use and the whole process is a rip off. I think it's a bad joke.I paid $300 for software and was then gouged for another $35 for some piece of plastic with a USB jack on the end of it, gimme' a break!"
1,iLok is unreliable,"Do not buy the iLok, even if you are able to make it work, you will NOT be able to keep it working.""iLok"" means ""DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE"""
1,Complain to the companies that use Ilok,"Anyone who is reading this has already purchased a product that requires it, so you're stuck with the situation described best by Andrew at the top: you're an Ilok slave. Prepare to be treated badly. But if enough of us complain to the companies that use the Ilok, the unreasonable problems described above could be easily rectified. Complain, complain, complain!!!!!!"
1,Terrible terrible device/company,"If this all worked fairly simply it would be bad enough, but it seems to be a complete kludge. I followed their instructions, but the drivers were not recognized even after repeated installations. How much time can you waste on something like this before it becomes a net loss? I decided I didn't need the software I was trying to install that badly, so I could throw this awful iLok device in the trash and get on with my life.I will agree with those who say, if it WORKED, I could live with it. As it is, I cannot.The only way a company can get away with being so unresponsive is by having customers who are essentially held hostage to this copy protection scheme."
1,"Pathetic junk, no support","My ILok died the week I got it. Non-existent support. 2 week wait to get it replaced. If you haven't already committed to studio system that uses it, pick a different studio. I sure wish I had."
1,I NEED HELP!,"Hello! My autotune requires this ilock, so I bought it, but it keeps asking for a regestration number, I put in my serial number that is on the ilock and its not it, can anyone help me?"
5,good product,It came in about 3 days instead of the usual 7 or 8 so that was very good. PLUS the product is exactly what i needed. WAY cheaper than the retail store sells it. what a bargain
4,PACE ilok USB Smart Key,The ILok holds information on your software that locks and unlocks the software. It provides security for users who may travel a lot and need to protect software or just a great security key to keep important information about software.
1,iLok's unfriendly customer support,"I downloaded a demo plugin software that required me to open an iLok account in order to try it. So I did, but then had an iLok driver software incompatibility issue. I contacted iLok and they denied it was a software problem on their part, and rudely closed my case. So I never was able to demo the software, This is bad for business for the software company. If I was able to at least test the software, I may have went ahead and purchased an iLok in addition to the cost of the software, but after that experience I refrain from purchasing any software that's protected by an iLok. I found companies like Native Instruments and G-Sonique which have excellent software and customer support, but also does not require an iLok. Just wanted to put that out there to forewarn others."
1,iLok is a license to steal. Complain to the companies that use it !!,"Pace (which produces the iLok) is a totally lame company with a totally lame product with MINIMAL and NEGATIVE customer support. Whoever buys a product that requires an iLok should complain bitterly to the company that does so. You will become a slave to a third-party (Pace) that doesn't give a damn about you because you are CAPTIVE! My iLok died (literally) and, of course, so did my iLok-dependent app (AutoTune). After an entire afternoon wasted on iLok's impossibly confusing ""support"" site, I finally got an RMA ONLY AFTER PAYING THEM $50 FOR A REPLACEMENT!!! Forget talking to a human at Pace. There aren't any. It's just a money machine."
3,Software companies don't tell you when you buy that you need this,"I bought the Synthogy ivory pianos. The description didn't say I need the ILok. I got the software, tried to install it and nothing. Looked through the manual and nothing about the ilok was under ""requirements"" which is where I would assume the ""requirements"" for running the program would be. I called support and they told me I need to buy the ILok. Mac osx wouldn't run without it.I understand the need for security and fighting piracy, but I agree with the previous reviewer it is frustrating. At the very least they should include in the software if you HAVE to have it to run the program. At the very least, make sure it's listed clearly so people know before they buy it.Besides the added expense of the software, the ILok takes up a USB port that usually contains my back up drive.If I had know this ahead of time, I probably would have gone with the acoustik pianos."
3,iLok key is way too big!,"I don't mind copy protection but I use a MacBook Pro and there are only two USB slots. A MIDI/Audio interface takes one and then I need to accommodate two dongles (Cubase and Ivory). Why some smarty pants thought it was a good idea to put a lot of plastic into making it key-shaped I have no idea. I can't easily fit an Ethernet cable, a compact USB hub and a firewire 800 drive connection along the side of the Mac.Why do people get cute with these things? Leave the key as a simple, thin stick and all would be fine."
1,God help you if something goes wrong,"Just wait until you try and register something under the wrong name. For example, I accidentally registered my Auto-tune under the wrong name. Anatares has no phone number to support this problem. Their web site doesn't deal with it. And ilok wants $25 to transfer the license. This is *after* paying for the software and paying for the ilok. This just sucks.Minus five stars for this one.I strongly recommend every avoiding any software that requires an ilok. Why should honest people get screwed like this after paying for the software?"
2,The smell is horrendous,"If this ever becomes available again, run screaming in the other direction.The case itself is well constructed and can carry your trumpet, mutes, etc.The glue used to put it together smells awful and will knock you over. My case has been on my balcony for two weeks and has not yet stopped outgassing."
3,Not Great,"I was looking for something specific, regarding an homage to Ghandi, one of the truly greatest human beings.... ""Generations to come will scarcely believe that someone such as this ever walked upon this earth in human form"", A. Einstein; (I prob mis-quoted, trying to commit to memory). I was hoping for more, other cuts have been better, but maybe there was something in the music I missed. Not my fav work of Ravi, but as I said, maybe you have to be Indian to truly appreciate. The movie Ghandi was wonderful, 5 stars IMHO."
2,Falls Over,"We bought this tree stand because it looked robust and held a ton of water. Last night, at 3:00 AM, our 6.5' tree fell over with a crash. My wife bolted from bed and I found her in tears by the tree. Eight ornaments were broken. This is the *second* (and last) year in-a-row this has happened. I believe the problem is two-fold. Conventional stands have a small spike on the bottom of the bowl to prevent the tree trunk from ""kicking-out"" to the side. Since this one is plastic, it doesn't offer this feature. Second, when you really reef down on the screws, the plastic tends to distort a bit and the screws tend to wander out of position - i.e., they aren't centered on the trunk anymore. I am here on Amazon this morning to find a metal stand that holds a good supply of water; has a wide base; and has that little spike in the bottom of the bowl to which I referred. Hope this info is helpful. John."
2,This is the second year in a row my tree has fallen over,"Beware of this stand. I bought one several years ago (not sure if it was the same brand, but looks exactly the same and I paid about the same price) at a big name home improvement store and it was great as long as my tree wasn't over 5 1/2 feet. Even with the two level screw system it is difficult to keep a larger tree - say, anything 6 feet and up, from tilting in the stand. I noticed over the past couple of days the tree leaning ever so slightly, and this evening, CRASH there it went. The tree didn't come out of the stand, the whole stand tipped over with it. The stand has a wide base, but something is missing, maybe it's too short or something. I wouldn't recommend this stand if you'd like your tree to stay upright."
3,"Tinker Bell ""Off To Never Neverland"" Universal-Fit Molded Front Floor Mats","Yet again the quality was fine. The problem again lies in the ""Universal-Fit"" The floor mats were to long for my car! So the only way I could have used them is if there was around an inch rolled over either at the driver's seat OR under the gas and brake. Neither of which was safe because they would shift while driving and keep you from fully depressing the brakes when you need them."
2,???,"I installed this, started using it and my son started laughing and told me that it was for kindergarten. No way this is for middle schoolers."
1,Doesn't Stand up properly,"ProsLight, thick bottom, no ground cloth needed.Good customer serviceConsIf there is wind or if you slightly move in the bivy it will collapse in your face. I thought this would be a great idea because of the pole; but it's very unstable and will frequently pop out of place, meaning you have to get out of the bivy to put it back in. The pole is held together with a small piece of velcro that is not perpendicular with the bivy pole and on the other side is a small hole for it."
3,Great gift!,"My youngest niece is a big movie buff, and has a dream to be in one someday. She LOVED getting this..."
4,Surprised by the other reviews,"I picked this up because I am a big fan of Anthony Hamilton, but I don't think its that much of a stretch from his previous work. His voice is on point, the beats are pretty decent, and the lyrics are true to his form. I really enjoy this album and wouldn't just recommend it for a die-hard fan but for any fan of the neo-soul movement."
1,Not about Indra's Pearls,Do not buy this book if you want to learn about Indra's pearls. Even those two words are only mentioned twice in the entire book and both times in the preface.
3,something missing,"I absolutely agree with the above person. I think this album is just an attempt to make money since Eric and Micahel(the men behind deep forest)have run out of ideas for a new one, after the disaster of ""music detected"". I believe ""While the earth sleeps"" comes from the extended edition of the album ""Boheme"", while the remix versions of ""Yuki song"", ""Sweet lullaby"" and ""Will you be ready"" havnt been heard before and are only featured in this CD. The rest are known songs from their past five studio works excluding ""Pacifique"", which is a movie sountrack recording but is still Deep Forest. One more thing, only two songs from my favorite album ""Comparsa"" were taken for this CD. I'm sure they considered ""tres marias"", ""green and blue"" and ""forest power"" I wonder why those didn't make it."
4,Overproduced but still worthy,"As a child of the '80s, ""Dream of Life"" was my first exposure to Patti Smith. I heard the sneers of Patti loyalists when it debuted, but the album blew my teenage mind. Ten years later, it feels homogenized compared to her earlier work, but ""Paths That Cross"" and ""Jackson's Song"" are timeless gems that worm into one's subconscious."
2,Hmmmm...,"I'm not really a fan of the Cockney Rejects, but I bought this one for a couple of songs. The CD is ok, but just not fast enough for me. This one is a little too British for me. I guess that's why they're called the Cockney Rejects! BUT My friends that like the Rejects love this album. It's definitely not for everyone..."
5,Fans of the old Cave In beware!,"Fans of earlier Cave In releases should take note: Cave In no longer plays the same style of evil sounding hardcore. As a band they have evolved into one of the best around. A good way to describe the new Cave In material is if Rush and Tool had a baby and it listened to Harcore, Punk, Emo and a little eastern music. Lead Singer Steve Brodsky has an amazing voice, which at times can serve as the driving force of the music, and at times can play only a supporting role. Not only that but they are lyrically sound, here's a lyrical sample from the song big riff; ""Your another coat of red in hell, kill this child to make sure I'd raise him well. On the concrete road to recovery while I'm knocking over every cone in front of me""Anyone who is a fan of experimental prog rock should definitely pick this up, and indie fans should not be afraid to pick this up either, it's just good music."
3,"A little too much ""trying""","This is an admirable improvement from the harsher and more limited death-metal influences which permeated their early work, but this spacey, more melodic work feels overly-ambitious a lot and ends up loosing vitality on repeated listens."
1,Stuart Olson missed the boat.,"The book details the essence of Mr. Liang and his t'ai chi and beyond.It is one thing to make a point that no t'ai chi teacher or any other human belongs on a pedestal, which the book heavily focuses on. However, this book descends heavily, excessively, unproductively (no matter one's view of or connection to Mr. Liang and Cheng Man Ch'ing) and at points like a run-on reprehensible gossip column into the events that led to and followed the falling out between T.T. Liang and Cheng Man Ch'ing.Through his long and close association and friendship with Mr. Liang, Stuart Olson had the opportunity to produce a much better biography than this gossip-infested book."
3,Not really the best of the eighties,"There are some tracks easily recognizable for anyone who was a teenager in the 80's, but most are unknown songs, sometimes played by famous groups, and sometimes don't.A good set, but hardly qualifies to be called ""Best of the eighties""."
3,It's the eighties... in Britain.,"This set is a British import. So, the hits on it will, necessarily, surprise some American palettes. There are many by groups like The Proclaimers, Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Marillion that won't be recognizable but deserve a listen. No, it's not the best of the American eighties, but worth it if you can find a used copy. Especially when you consider what all of the tracks would cost you separately."
4,Pretty good,"I am taking the exam in a week or two and I've been using this book to study. It has a few practice exams etc. and in depth reviews on english, math and science. This is math I haven't looked at since high school and they broke it down nicely so that I was able to pick it back up. I definitely recommend this book."
4,"good review, some errors","i aced my TEAS test on almost all areas and had no problems getting into my competitive RN nursing program.the book provided a pretty good review for my nursing board exam, but i did notice there were a few errors or typos in the book --- watch out!"
1,I took the TEAS and NLN.,"This book didnt help with either test. Its not really targeting anything except to teach you the basics, and I really mean the basics. Each nursing exam is different and focuses on different parts of science and vocab/grammer. This book only gives you a general idea. Dont waste your time and money, just get the book from the nursing league you'll be taking it from, that way you can practice THEIR exams to get a better idea what they'll be testing you on."
2,The Doctor is autistic...,"This book was something of disappointment. Definitely my least favorite of the series, so far. The Doctor is overly shown as being crazed and nonsensical in the beginning, and Sam is caught up in visions of her future that aren't her future. I understand that the writer was trying to keep you confused, just as the characters were, about what exactly is going on until the explanation at the end, but the solution for how people are infected with the ability to never die doesn't satisfy. I loved the overall explanation for what was causing the rebirth and later destruction of the sun, but Jim Mortimore failed to hold my interest for the couple hundred pages leading up to the big reveal. Overall a mediocre addition to the Eighth Doctor's adventures."
2,"I would skip this one, bad writing!","The Doctor is totally crazy in this one, I won't spend the money on it"
2,Ignores Mac users,"While this book has some useful information, the author seems to go out of his way to avoid helping Macintosh users. Given the popularity of the iMac DV and G3/G4 Macs with built-in firewire, it would make sense to at least have some pictures and/or commands to use this with the MacOS. In addition, the CD is not compatible for use with same. Most of the books I have on Adobe products recognize that at least half (or more) of the users of Photoshop, Premiere, etc., are Mac users and manage to give information helpful to both Mac and Windows users with little difficulty. Apparently, this is beyond the capability of Mr. Doucette."
2,Disappointed Reader,"I purchased this book with high hopes based on my previous experience with the ""dummies"" series. Unfortunately, the author seemed to deliberately avoid helping Mac users, and concentrated too much on Adobe products. I am a beginner, with lots of VHS-C tapes that I want to digitize and clean up. I have had some early success with the XLR8 ""Interview"" digitizer, with Strata's Videoshop on my Mac G3, and wanted to learn more. When the author sticks with basics, it is fine, but when he concentrates on PCs to the neglect of Macs, and on Adobe's Premier to the neglect of others, he has lost me."
5,Pretty Good,I am surprised this book didn't get better reviews. I found it very helpful. I am trying to learn more on the subject of DV and it was packed with important information on things like lighting and equipment. Things you wouldn't know unless you studied DV post production. I would definitely recommend this for the aspiring beginner videographer.
3,A good start for beginners,"I'll keep this short: The first half of the book is great with tips for shooting and general techniques. The second half is all about three different editing programs on computers. Of course, the program I bought (Pinnacle Studio 8) wasn't covered. I would have prefered to have seen more on the shooting tips, and less on the programs. I'd buy another Dummies book all about the program if they made one for Pinnacle. Overall though, it was worth the price for the first half I suppose."
3,digital Video For Dummies,"Helpful, but not advanced enough for really good use. My editing equipment does not match the book's.I still liked the product."
1,Very disappointed in this purchase,"This book was written several years ago and obviously, doesn't cover todays crop of HD camcorders. If I had known that, I wouldn't have purchased it. Amazon should furish the publish date in the description of the books it sells. I then would have known it wasn't for me."
1,Does not measure up to other Dummies books,"I am a big fan of Dummies books and own 21 of them, but this one does not measure up. This book tries to cover too much ground and does not do any of it well. It is more a plug for Adobe software than a basic coverage of digital video. There are so much more reasonably priced hardware and software packages for capturing and editing digital video, than are covered by his brief examples. I would like to have seen more about digital video basics and less about trying to sell Adobe software.I was shocked to see that someone of Mr. Doucettes background really did not understand the relationship of depth of field and focal length. He has it exactly opposite of reality on page 40 and the figure on page 41. Makes me wonder.This book will leave you a ""dummy""."
2,Really for dummies,And I must be a dummy. I learned nothing from this book. It was too basic for me. However for a beginner it may be useful. I think it could have been written with the tieele Beginning Digital Video for dummies.
5,Cerebral guitar for guitarists...,Alec is a guitar player's guitarist. His arrangements and playing has to be the most cerebral take on traditional music I've heard. One of the things that struck me about Alec's playing is the tone he is able to produce. It is exquisite.I hope this is music that will be playing in heaven. I can listen to it over and over.
4,"Good, not great Celtic guitar","This CD came well reviewed on the Amazon site. Alec is one of the guitarists whose work makes the circles of guitar teaching literature. It is pretty music, and he adds tasteful arrangements to traditional tunes. But I was a bit disappointed, and urge listeners to consider works by Steve Baughman, particularly ""The Angels' Portion"", or Duck Baker or Tony McManus for the very best of Celtic guitar."
2,The Makeing of a Villain with a Hidden Christian Message,"This odd book describes the rise (or fall, depending on one's point of view) of an evil sorcerer of a kind who would be a villain in most fantasy books. The book describes his moral decay in a way that seems plausible and realistic. The book ultimately has a fundamentalist Christian message. The ""hero"" is a strong negative example that is meant to show the emptyness of a materialist existence and the quest for power. I was fairly far into the book before I realized that magic was an irrelevent sideshow, unimportant to the plot. The book is very effective as a rhetorical tool, and as an argument for conventional religion. The book also contains some strong anti-Catholic messages, and the old notion that the world would still be in the Middle Ages without the Protestand Reformation (a notion I find silly)."
1,Grundfos Brute Three Speed 1/25 Recirculator Pump,I am giving a one star rating since the pump arrived without a three speed setting or a built-in check valve. The description describes the pump as having these features. Pump is going back!
2,broke before a year,"Got two of these for my parents home boiler system to replace the same ones they had (they had just got the house and they were broken). They installed them in the beginning of the year, and now in oct they went out! My dad does this for a living so we know it was not an installment problem. It is just past the return date from amazon..."
4,Great product,"These binoculars are extremely light and portable, the lenses let in a lot of light, and the image is crisp with vivid colors. The lack of eyepiece covers hasn't been a problem. These have been fantastic for bird watching, between the excellent optics and the light weight (less neck strain not only because the binoculars are hanging around your neck but also because you're pointing them upwards into trees).Only complaints:- Setting interpupillary distance is a finicky process. Eyepieces may not be aligned properly. I have to bend the binoculars to a very specific angle to get a circular field of view. The hubby can't get a circular field of view.- Not so good for viewing objects less than 20 feet away. Circular field of view becomes two distinct circles and you might have to refocus the binoculars (as you might expect). Minor complaint, though. These are fantastic binoculars that weigh almost nothing."
3,A Fun Flight of Fancy,"Nothing new ever happens at Grandfather's house, and his favorite response to everything is ""Could be worse!"" One day he overhears his grandchildren wondering if anything interesting ever happens to him, and the next morning he greets them with a tremendously tall tale involving a kidnapping by a large bird, an encounter with an abominable snowman, a journey to the bottom of the sea, and a ride on a paper airplane. It becomes evident at the end of his story that his is gently pulling the children's legs, and they respond with appropriate teasing: ""Could be worse!""The story is well paced, nicely crafted and easy to read, but what really makes it fun is Stevenson's whimsical, funny artwork. The gentle relationship between Grandfather and his grandchildren is positive and warm, and children will enjoy this flight of fancy, grounded in the context of a secure relationship. It's not a classic, but certainly worth reading a few times."
3,The secret of the front cover revealed!,"Turn the album upside down. First to the upper right is Bob Weir. He is looking to the left at John Barlow, Bob's lyricist. Mickey Hart is all the way to left center looking all the way to the right at Bill Kreutzman's one eye. Brent Mydland has the bright shining eyes in the center of the picture. Jerry Garcia is on the bottom left looking to Robert Hunter (Jerry's lyricist) who is looking ""In The Dark"".The photograph inside shows the band ""in the light"" and there we see Phil Lesh standing out more than anyone, also the look Bob Weir is giving is exactly like the way John Barlow is looking on the front, totally tongue and cheek.My favorite version of this album was on cassette because it had a song called:""My Brother Esau"" that isn't available on LP or CD. It's a pretty good album. Brent Mydland's ""Tons Of Steel"" I thought was a great song. ""My Brother Esau"" was always my favorite song though."
4,Consitently Strong Throughout,"To take advantage of the bonus track, My Brother Esau, my review will be based on the casette version. This bonus track features some good Bob Weir Vocals and some slick percussion beats by Mickey Hart. Overall, this recording is very balanced between Jerry and Bobby songs. Jerry really gives some excellent vocal performances on all of his songs most particularly Touch Of Grey. And his guitar playing is very up to standards. Some people may not care for Brent's singing but I find it just fine thank you as his vocal and the arrangement stylings just adds to the depth on this recording. At this stage in the eighties, good classic rock n roll records were few and far between. This is one of the few."
5,another great cd,i found out about this cd from and i am happy. this is another great album by a great group. some day i hope to have all of their music.
4,the Dead's hit album,"This one is probably easier for some to digest as it has a more accessible sound than some of the other albums by the band. This was the album that put the band on the map commercially speaking. Those of us who were already fans at the time found it a little hard to take due to the fact that it has such a radio friendly feel. This new version has bonus tracks but some of them are only so-so. One of the songs ""My Brother Esau"" was a bonus track on the cassette when the album was first released. The cassette had slightly different sequencing and was arranged better. I wish for this release that they would have gone with the cassette sequencing but then I wished that back in '87 too."
1,The Dead Are Very Overrated!,"I don't care what anyone says! I dislike this group! I usually love improvisation and innovation (Coltrane, Allmans, Davis, etc.). But I can't see where the Dead fit into the innovation part of the equation. Now onto this CD, eighties production makes the Dead's boring sound even worse! Stay away! This band contains all the worst aspects of the sixties!"
3,Last good Dead album....but NOT last Dead album,"To all ""In The Dark"" reviewers out there who seem to think that ""In The Dark"" was the Dead's last album...you need to do alittle more homework. Check the year 1989 and an album titled ""Built To Last"". ""Black Muddy River"" is NOT the last song that Jerry Garcia sang lead on.....that again would be found on ""Built To Last"".""In The Dark"" is a good album, ""Built To Last"" is not. Neither are great. The last great Dead album was probably ""Shakedown Street"" in 1978...or the funky but sometimes odd ""Go To Heaven"" (1980)...but even those albums pale in comparison to a few others.In the end, no Dead studio album can match a good Dead live show. ""Workingmans Dead"" and ""American Beauty"" are outstanding studio works......but watch and listen to ""The Closing Of Winterland"".....and you'll see that live Dead is the best Dead."
3,a hit record,"The studio record that turned them into a stadium live act, grossing an enormous amount of money by playing very large venues for their last 8 years.Although quite good produced, well recorded and performed, still more strile and flat than their live records. Were they insecure in the studio or what? Most songs sound better in live versions."
4,great cd even better songs,"I was friended by Glen Matlock on Myspace and loved the songs, so I purchased his 2 cd's, well Open Mind is a great cd all songs I love.One thing it's not too sex Pistols style but it has it's own sound.I recommend you go to their myspace page and see for yourself.http://www.myspace.com/glenmatlockandthephilistines"
2,disappointing,Very small channel for the 2 feed-thru wires (neutral + ground). Any wires with even medium thickness insulation are a struggle. Broke two units trying to make it work.
4,A collection of difficult problems that will test you,"This book was one of the first of the collections of problems by Florentin Smarandache that I read. As the title implies, it contains only a listing of problems, with solutions the province of the reader. I spent a great deal of time working with these problems and managed to make progress on several of them. Like all good mathematics problems, complete solutions are elusive, difficult and fun to pursue. I enjoyed them so much that it was part of the motivation for me to write three books on the problems posed by Smarandache, which are known as Smarandache notions.The problems are primarily in the area of number theory, which as the luminary Paul Erdos often said, makes them easy to state and understand, but hard to prove. If you are interested in problems that will frustrate and fascinate you, check out the ones in this book."
1,Suicide,"At a time when fine music is fighting for its life, Haroncourt delivers this. The sound is crystalline. Every voice is heard. The performance is dead, dead, dead. For the good of music, Harononcourt should remove the key that winds his clockwork heart and throw it away. This is the most lifeless performance of the Mozart Requiem on disk. Many more like this and classical music will be dead--it can take only so many defeats."
3,windtunnel breathing; where are the basses,"Though this performance was interesting and moving, as a recording it left much to be desired. The basses could barely be heard, especially when they sing alone and should have been heard best. More annoying was the embarassingly loud breathing by the chorus in quiet sections and before each new section of the Requiem. As a choral singer, I know that all professional choruses work on ""silent breathing"" at these times. I am aware that this was a live performance but these problems really detracted from the music (especially the recording balance) and could have been dealt with at least in part in the recording studio."
4,Requiem & La Chasse,"For the most part, Harnoncourt keeps his quirkiness under control and accordingly delivers a stunning performance. Such are his insights, even those who suffer from K 626 Fatigue will quake as if hearing this masterpiece for the first time. The sound-engineers have excelled themselves. That being said, I would have bet good money that the Hostias was going to be a trainwreck before I hit the play-button and so it proved to be. Call me an antiquated Romantic if you want, but this movement (and the text itself) clamours for a meditative approach, not an attempt to break the land speed record. So all in all, this is a stellar performance with one big fat sunspot."
5,"""Goofy Goofus""","I cannot rate this book as I am trying to obtain one.Ijust know it would be 5 stars. The name of the book ""Goofus Glass"" by Carolyn McKinley caught my attention since I like to collect glass made in the 40""s. I attend flea markets and auctions trying to locate a piece. My friends and family tease me and ask me when was the last time I went Goofy Glass Hunting."
3,ONLY ABOUT HALF OF KNOWLEDGE FOR EITHER NT4.0 TEST,"Decent prep for the two NT Tests, But Not Great.Good book to study to set a pace for preparing for the two MCSE certifications it partially covers. If you work in NT networks already, skip this book and get an Exam Cram instead. But follow up with the second step: Windows NT Technical Support. If you're new to MCSE/MCP process and don't work on an NT network, then this is more along your line for quick understanding of account and printer management/creation and general admin tasks.After several self-tests, I realized I was not ready to sit for the exam after finishing this book. I dug a little deeper into the subject requirements for the NT Server 4.0 exam [described in the book in small type] and discovered this book doesn't completely cover what is required for the exam!!! To pass the exams you need to read and study 'Windows NT Technical Support Training' as well."
4,Easy to follow!!!,"This book is an easy guide to follow. I am currently working through it at the moment. The lessons are not too complex and with a little basic knowledge the matter is easily understood. I like the way it is split up into short lessons. This makes studying during lunch-breaks and evenings more possible. Also having a copy of NT supplied with it makes life a lot easier.The first reviewer in this list said that the book did not cover ""half the material required for the exam"". If he had bothered to read the documentation it actually says that to pass the exams you need to read 'Windows NT Tecnical Support Training' as well. Together, the two books apparrently cover all the material required. I look forward to working through that book next."
5,A great guide to keep you from becoming a paper MCSE.,"If you want a great training guide for NT administration, then this it. The book contains hands-on exercises for administering an NT network in a single domain. Many of the reviews here will tell you that it is not good for preparing for the exam, that's true. But it will give you great hands on experience that will help you on an NT exam.Too many people out there out just concerned about passing the exam without really knowing how to perform hands on tasks. If you want to really know NT administration then this guide is for you."
2,Very Disheartening.....,"This book did not do what I had hoped it could coming from the makers of the operating system it covers. First, the book itself did a poor job in covering the many aspects of Windows NT 4. It barely covered the most basic aspects and left out a great deal of NT. The CD-ROM included had some decent labs for beginners but there were not enough of them. If you are looking for a book to purchase for preparation of a Microsoft exam for MCP or MCSE this one should be left out. Everything covered in this book can be easily found in just about any other book dealing with NT4. While it can bring a person who knows nothing of NT to knowing something, it presents hadly any new knowledge to users with even a little NT background."
1,Do NOT buy this book if you are studying for the exam!,"The self-paced book for Networking Essentials allowed me to pass that exam without a problem so I thought I'd stick to the series for the NT Server exam. However, after reading 7 of the 11 chapters and fiddling with the self tests (sold separately), I realized I was no where near ready for the exam. I dug a little deeper into the subject requirements for the NT Server 4.0 exam and discovered this book doesn't even cover HALF of what is required for the exam!!! Do yourself a favor and buy Alan Carter's MSCE study guide and pass on this one!"
5,I have found this is a very good book for the beginners.,This is a very good book for the beginners in the field of Network Administration. I recommend you to purchase this book before you purchase any other book in Network Administration field. After you purchase Windows NT Technical Support.
5,OH MY GOD,"I have loved this version of Rumpelstiltskin my whole life. I CANNOT believe it is on DVD soon. I am forever grateful. The cartoon version on the front made me think it might be him, and it was! The exact one I grew up with!The animation is haunting and his personality is amazing. I love the songs. I'm sorry, but this DVD release is going to be a MUST-BUY for me. THANK YOU FHE!!!"
5,Best Moisturizing Stick I've ever used,I am no longer able to locate the Jason Tea Tree & Lavender Moisturizing Stick. It is the best moisturizing stick I've ever used. There is no need to dip my fingers in gooey cream; this is great for travel. I can slip it in my pocket and go. I'm 65 years old and people look at my face and think I'm 15 to 20 years younger and I attribute it to the many years I've used this product in addition to protecting my face from cigarette smoke. I am also an extremely light user of alcohol. I wish this product would come back.
5,"After 10Years,this CD is still a Tressure","After 10 years,this Album is priceless.Carly has taken us to the great standards of the 40's.Frank Sinatra's,""In the wee small hours of the morning,""while our GI's were fighting for our country.Fred Astaire's,""I'll go my way by myself."" And Carly's own original,""What has he got."" This album is a classic. Carly's voice is perfection.My Mom loved this tape,especially ""My funny Valentine."" It brought back all the great memories of the 40's when she was a young girl,back to life. There still playing cuts from this CD on the radio,and ""My Romance"" is on a TV perfume AD sung as a duet with Ben Taylor.I loved Carly's HBO special with most of these songs featured,along with Harry Connick,Jr. Anyone that wants to hear some good music for a change,play this record tonight."
4,Good change of pace for Carly,"This is a nice collection of essentially Broadway show tunes generally well performed by the distinctive vocalizations of Carly Simon. Ms Simon's type of voice requires careful material selection and for the most part that quality is evident on this CD. She does struggle a little on a few tracks, most notably on My Funny Valentine and her own composition, What Has She Got, ( which incidentally begins with a terrific verse but falls short of the mark afterwards ). She makes up for these few deficiencies however with fine work on the majority of tracks including outstanding efforts on Little Girl Blue and He Was Too Good To Me. All in all, a fine edition to your late night, pour the wine collection."
1,Less Romantic than Painful,"My now-wife bought this album when we were dating. She lit some candles, poured wine, and started the CD. Miss Simon was so far off-key that we laughed so hard we couldn't make out.It's not that Miss Simon is that bad a vocalist--this just isn't her music, any more than it is Rod Stewart's or Linda Ronstadt's or any of the other aging pop-rock singers who turn to standards when their careers flag. It's as if they don't realize that these songs call for *better* pipes, not tired rock voices.If you want to hear these songs the way they were meant to be sung, there are plenty of better singers. If you want to hear Carly Simon doing what she does best, put on ""No Secrets."""
3,THIS IS ONE CD THAT ALMOST WENT UNNOTICED.,"I BOUGHT THIS CD IN EARLY 1990 SHORTLY AFTER IT'S RELEASE. I REALLY LIKED IT FROM THE BEGINNIG. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WENT UNNOTICED BY THE PUBLIC UNTIL THE PRODUCERS OF ""SLEEPLESS IN SEATLE"" USED ONE OF THE CUTS IN THE MOVIE. THEN THE PUBLIC BECAME AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CD. I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY CDS WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED. OUT OF THE 12 SONGS LISTED I LIKED 8."
1,NOT a book for Stallone fans,"This book is so full of errors and inconsistancies that I began to doubt everything in it. It made me wonder if the author even knows Sly as a person or understands him in any capacity. It certainly isn't a book for Stallone FANS because it portrays Sly as a bottom feeder and (tries!) to makes the reader think that Sly is a low-life who possesses every negative quality known to mankind. Not only does the author make fun of Sly on practically every page from beginning to end, he also quotes all negatives from ""alledged"" co-workers, ""friends"", critics, etc. Most of the ""quotes"" from Stallone are hearsay, not from actual interviews between Sly and the author. And nowhere in the book will you find that Sly cooperated with or endorsed this ""biography"". It's a joke and the worst [amount of money] I ever spent on a book. ..."
3,For fans only,"How good could be an unauthorized biography of a living person? Not too great, but it's the only one on the market that deserves to throw an eye on. Something to stand on my library's shelf beside ""Sly Moves : My Proven Program to Lose Weight, Build Strength, Gain Will Power, and Live your Dream""."
5,Initial comments,"Delivery was super quick - happy about that. Item was an exact replacement motor so installation/replacement was easy - happy about that. Read a lot of reviews about how these don't last - not particularly happy about that, but if they last 10 years like the originals I'd be happy about that."
1,JUNK! Spend a little more for a quality motor.,"This motor was in my attic for just under 4 years before it seized a month ago. My builder had put this in my new home, no doubt the cheapest thing on the market. I removed the motor from inside the attic, it wasn't fun but I got it out and was surprised at the small size and lightness in weight of the motor.I could have replaced it with the same but went to Home Depot and they had one type of replacement motor on the shelf. In comparison to the original motor, it was about 2/3 heavier and longer but about the same in circumference. The replacement fit perfectly in the bracket in the attic.The new motor quality appears far superior to the original I replaced. Also, it has sealed bearings and brushless in design. I am not sure of the Lomanco model having these features but I am guessing it doesn't. Regardless, the Lomanco model died in just a few years and quality motors typically last 20 years."
4,"Nice, Direct Fit Replacement for Old Motor","I'm no mechanic, but was able to easily replace the motor in our attic power vent with this new one in about an hour. Fit was perfect, and no problems were encountered. Only shortcoming is the overall design of the motor, which uses bushings instead of bearings, and thus will have a shorter life than a better-built motor that would probably cost a lot more."
5,Easy to install; works great!,This motor was exactly what I needed. It was easy to install and it works great!
2,Motor worked for a couple days,Installed the motor on a weekend. Took under 10 minutes. Checked to see if all was well the following weekend and it wasnt working. Took it back out and returned it to Lomanco. I'm waiting on a new one. Hope I have better luck with this new one.
3,WORTHLESS INSTRUCTIONS,"I am not sure how this motor will work. The instructions are worthless............or maybe I should say ""wordless"" Good grief, how long would it have taken to write out instructions for how to replace the motor on the 5 or 6 different units this thing might fit. Standing up in a hot attic, damn near in the dark, is no place to try and figure something out."
3,great value,cheap enough to lose without greaving. Accurate scales but inexpensive. The write-on side is a convenient bonus worth addition $$$.
5,GREAT AMP,I CONNECTED THIS AMP AS SOON AS I GOT IT AND I WAS SURPRISED OF THE POWER THIS AMP HAS WHENBRIDGED. I WAS RUNNING AN INFINITY 10 INCH 200RMS BUT HAD TO UPGRADE TO A 12 INCH INFINITY 250RMSTO HANDLE THE POWER THIS AMP PUTS OUT. I GOT GREAT SOUND FOR A GREAT PRICE. I RECOMMENDED ITTO MY BEST FRIEND AND NOW HE HAS ONE AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. HAVE THIS AMP FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW.
1,"Girl, Interminable","This book is a great tale of life in a psychiatric ward.However, due to its diary format, it has no beginning or end, and certainly no main plot, making it easy to put down and pick up later.I wish the author the best, but I didn't get much information that would be practical for my own life out of her book."
3,Dear Diary...,"Musings of a Mad Madam is an interesting look inside the mind of a hospitalized bipolar. It's presented as a series of musings, short vignettes of daily life and the tenuous friendships formed while in a psychiatric hospital. This format, almost poetic in the sparse wording, could only come from a broken mind, a mind where all illusions and guile have been temporarily stripped away.Bravo!"
3,Fanny Brice,"Fanny Brice the Original Funny Girl is an interesting read, however, it is a bit wordy in places and unfortunately unless you are up on your entertainers of the 20's and early 30's there are a lot of names that are not all that familiar to a younger reader such as myself (even though I am in my 70's). Also there are a lot of pages at the end of the book that have no meaning at all so the book seems to be cut off half way through. Since I do enjoy reading about entertainers of the past and have seem both Funny Girl and Funny Lady I did enjoy the book."
2,kattywatty,"Boring, stupid book. Parts are interesting...but mostly boring. I paged trying to find something worth reading...very few and far between. She comes off so stupid....i think a lot of what was in the book was made up. How could they remember all the stuff they printed? I got to chaper three and just couldnt go on...like i stated, i paged some...crap."
5,great blues rock,jhb first cd is a masterpiee of rock and ballard from see the light to angel eyes a must buy
5,I fell in love with the assistance of this CD...,"Excellent work from an up and coming guitarist. You'd never know the man is blind. The song ""Angel Eyes"" is my fiancee's and my inspiration."
3,Somewhat Dissapointing,The first Jeff Healey album I heard was Mess of Blues which I enjoyed. This album is pretty good rock but not the kind of blues Healey was known for.
5,Jeff Healey Band - See The Light,"I first bought this on cassette when it first came out back in '88, after I saw Jeff Healey perfrom ""Confidence Man"" in the movie ""Roadhouse."" This is a classic blues/rock cd that will stand the test of time. Healey will keep the house rockin' from beginning to end with this cd. You might want to buy two (or ten) copies of this in case you wear the first one out!"
2,M&M does it better,"I was a playtester for the Tri-Stat version of this game and never saw the d20 version until it hit the stores. Really, the best thing I can say about this version is, the cover is MUCH better than the Tri-Stat cover. Beyond that for a d20 supers game....well, Mutants & Masterminds does it a whole lot better. Much easier to understand rules and, really, you will find it usefull to have the Tri-Stat version if you try to run this game.In the end, if you want to play SAS, go get the Tri-Stat version (very good game). Want to play d20 supers? M&M; is the answer."
2,"Eh. Not bad, but not great.","This book I thought looked awesome and was my answers and prayers to a superhero game. After buying the book, I saw how annoying it really is. OK I can understand the classes, and levels for a character that is all fine and dandy. The powers are very confusing how some of them actually work, and making up a character takes WAY TOO LONG and gives you a headache. There is no support for this game due to the company packing up and going bye-bye due to lack of money (wonder why?). M&M is the way to go, this book is just... ""eh""... will say its a good reference book for other superhero games. Good history of about comics in the beginning."
1,Character Classes for Superheroes?,"I have spent a long time looking for the perfect superhero RPG and this is NOT it. Not only did I find the book painfully hard to read because of the busy border and cramped looking layout, it tries to pigeonhole superheroes into character classes. I just couldn't imagine playing a superhero that was a 2nd level Costumed Hero and a 3rd level gadgeteer. Go play mutants and masterminds. It may be a bit more expensive for a smaller book, but it is so much better for this genre."
1,Not a true D20 game...,"Unfortunately the folks at GOO are more interested in A) Preaching about how great comics were 30 years ago as opposed to the current state of the business and B) Hyping their tri-stat version of the game than they are in making a functional and worthwhile addition to the D20 universe.This books is simply a poorly thrown together conversion of the tri-stat game of the same name with which they hope to reap profits simply by having the D20 name attached. This game did prove one thing, classes and levels do NOT belong in the super hero genre. It just doesn't work. My suggestions for those in search of a decent D20 superhero game, looks elsewhere."
2,Mutants & Masterminds blows this book away,"O.K. - Look past the black and white, non-gloss pages, with artwork that cannot compare to Green Ronin / Super Unicorn's masterpiece 'Mutants & Masterminds'. Look past the fact that most people who want to play a superhero RPG will want to play in the modern day, not in the 'silver age' which will detract immediatly due to the title of this book. Look past a system that isn't completely d20 (which, lets face it, no superhero RPG I have seen is EXACTLY verbaitum a translation of d20 made into a super-powered game). What you are left with when you look past all that is a decent game for people who have never read a comic book, but have heard all about them from their friends who are able to read.Was I too harsh?If you don't believe me, buy this book, Amazon has a wonderful return policy."
4,good reference,"Being a Chiropractor, I am always interested in new info on wellness and staying healthy.This book offers insight into the importance of diet and nutrition. This is stuff I have found very useful when trying to educate my own patients. The author's other book,Prescriptions for nutritional healing, is another excellent reference for people interested in becoming and staying well."
3,confused by content,"I was greatly impressed with ""Prescription for Nutritional Healing"" and when buying this book had that in mind. Both Ms. Balch and Dr. Balch (husband?) produced a very informative work with that title and I'm very thankful for it, regardless of my thoughts toward ""...Dietary Wellness"".I picked up a copy of this book today and have been reading it. I was struck by the counsel for total avoidance Ms. Balch gave to all forms of Capsicum (pepper), and the advice that one should avoid both black and white pepper, as well as rice.I found no remarks as to why this should be the case (which would seem a no-brainer considering the obvious health benefits of Capsicum, assorted Piperaceae and rice in ones diet). 'Leaves me somewhat mystified."
2,Content okay . . . Details Missing!,"I have searched long and hard for a reference book and this was a let down. I felt the content was mediocre at best and the details behind their ""research"" and claims were missing. I found a better resource on Inner Health that was very impressive at librarydepot.com It contained a Nutrition Benefits Chart that is unlike anything on the market."
2,I didn't like the book,"I disliked this book.Too many people reading the book might not go to a doctor to heal.I think that some foods can help you,but I strongly believe in doctors."
1,*Snore*,"I put this cd on so I... *snore*...could review it...*snore*...but sorry, I fell asleep halfway through the first song...*snore*...so sorry...God, it's dreary...gotta go...*zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............*"
1,couldn't quite make it to the end of the first song,"Someone had given this thing to my dad (he/she must have hated him), and having heard of a few of g's songs on the radio and having known what kind of a (non)musician g really is, I mustered up the courage to listen to this album after a few years, just to be reminded why we all hate this guy and the likes of him. I really was going to listen to the whole thing, but I just couldn't get past, I think it was like the first 10 seconds or so, when the wind chimes or whatever that was got me into a state of pure panic, and I just had to turn the thing off.So I suppose I shouldn't be rating this guy, since a masterpiece could have followed. But I cannot think of any masterpieces followed by windchimes, can you?"
4,Silhouette,"I liked this CD, but don't think that it was his best effort. The songs All In One Night and We've Saved the Best for Last are a little bland, but that doesn't make this a bad CD. Paulinho da Costa does some fine percussion work in Let Go and Pastel. I know some people dislike Kenny G's music, but I guess they don't know that Kenny G used to practice on the saxophone for 4 hours a day, every day for 12 years. The man has put his time in!I know that people who would not listen to Kenny G's music and they are just as entitled to their opinion as people who like it, but why don't they turn some of that vitriol toward someone who really deserves it. At least Kenny G's music isn't laced with unnecessary and nearly constant profanity, and it doesn't sell the message that killing policemen, degrading women, murdering people, and committed armed robbery is cool. Sorry for venting, but I had to get that off my chest."
5,Incredible!,"Mark Murphy continues to amaze me. He is a singer's singer and an unbelieveable musician. Jareau and so many others owe so much to him, including myself. What a GREAT album!"
1,Where are those wonderful Cole Porter melodies ?,"As a singer of the 'Great American Songbook"", in addition to the lyrics I absolutely love the melodies of Cole Porter. Although I have seen the changes in Mark Murphy from his earlier recordings, when he used to sing the songs in a more ""streight"" manner, to his more recent recordings, where the melodies are almost lost within his improvisations, I have to admitt that Mark still managed to ""surprise"" me. The changes he makes to those wonderful Cole Porter melodies are making these songs almost irrecognizeable. This is not the best way to pay homage to Cole Porter."
1,Terrible book,"This is a very poorly written book, examples are not clearly shown or in some cases not even properly done. One example problem in chapter two gives the question and the answer is ""Through a series of mathematical equations and procedures you get this: (answer)"" with no helpful information. Proper tables and information may be pages away from the actual example or explanation. Some sentences are broken by formulas with no relevance to what the sentence is describing, only for you to find out the equation is for an example you were looking at several pages earlier. There are typos and errors on every page, which my professor had to continuously correct and tell us what to actually do.The only reason I would buy this book for is if your class requires it and you have no other way to get problem sets. I would definitely suggest another book."
2,Are you kidding?,"Naturally. probability and counting are difficult concepts to grasp. So therefore, let's make a book without answers in the back (ehm, what's the point of solving a problem if you don't have anything to check it against?). I'm rather surprised this comes out of an engineer.What I'm not surprised by is the explanations. They are like bombs. Basically, here's an equation, it works, use it (maybe that's how engineers work?). Why does it work? Derivation? Hello? Wherever there are actually explanations I would not consider them enough for a regular student to understand.I'm disappointed, this book is making my prob and stats course harder than it should be."
1,Weak on applications and statistics,"I have used this book for a course on probability and statistics for engineers, and will not use it again. The author is apparently more versed on probability than on statistics, because the latter topics are poorly explained. A section on linearization in the regression chapter is actually a dangerous misapplication and should be replaced by material explaining nonlinear regressions. The section on analysis of variance uses dot notation that's different from the standard used in most other texts and will therefore be confusing to many. The CD that's provided is not useful in a pedagogic sense since it is a ""black box"" in its actual function. But the most serious shortcoming in this book is the failure to bridge the gap between theory and application: there are no worked examples in most cases, just equations in the chapter, then problems at the end."
1,Errors!,"This book has good organization of subject matter. The examples used are pretty good too.However, within no more than an hour of flipping through various chapter of my interest, I found 2 errors. What baffled me was that the errors were so easy to catch and yet they existed in the THIRD edition! Unforgivable!I reckon at this rate there have to many more to be unearthed! The author definitely needs better proof-reading."
3,"Five for book, -2 for being statistics",A good job on an unpleasant subject. I'm not exactly sure though... I just used the boxes with the magic formulas in them. And the table.
2,Struggled to finish,"I've read quite a few Culture books but this one was really hard to finish and I've had to skim through many pages as they were the ""blah, blah, blah"" kind of style. The flashbacks really killed the story for me. It was quite difficult to follow it with so many interruptions. I would finish a chapter and dread the inevitable flashback that was so hard to digest! I've read the reviews about the ""surprising"" ending. Maybe I missed something but the ending meant nothing to me and it didn't really have any significance on the main story. Anyway, even if I ignore everything I've mentioned so far, the story is quite weak and too much like a Hollywood blockbuster movie. The only thing missing is a car chase on a busy highway where the main character escapes from a horrific crash... wait, it does have that!"
5,Not your typical Sci-Fi... it's a whole lot better!,"""Use of Weapons"" is not your typical sci fi easy reading. Iain M Banks expects you to work harder than most authors of this genre, but rewards you for it. If you haven't read any of his other ""Culture"" novels, some of the concepts in this book can seem a little daunting. Persist for a wonderful window on this series, however.One particularly interesting aspect is that Banks is adept at mixing futuristic technology such as spaceships, forcefields and awesome weapons with basic human qualities. Even more than other sci-fi authors I've read, you feel you can relate to the motivations of his characters due to the common human themes.Greta holiday reading!"
3,Passable space opera,"I picked this up as part of the Kindle $1 sale. It was good enough to finish reading, with fun tech and more developed characters than most space opera. The main storyline is engaging, but the flashbacks used to develop the character are a mixed bag with about half of them being boring, confusing, or both."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This book was really disappointing, compared to the rest of the Culture novels I have read. Disjointed, jumping all over the place, and enough to even be somewhat confusing at times, not a good thing. The book hasn't enough focus on the childhood issues that ended up being at the heart of the matter. Worst Culture novel by far. When the best character is a drone robot, perhaps a little bit of a problem."
2,Disappointed,"I have been a hard core SiFi reader for over 40 years and I have read some novels I have been disappointed with, but this one is at the top of my list. Since I only paid a dollar to download it to my Kindle I guess I should not complain too much, but this is not a very good book. Disjointed is mild in describing the flow of the story,the ending was terrible and did not seem to be confirmed by the story itself."
1,Cheap Trick: Slow and Confusing,"Not worth the dollar nor especially the time I spent reading it to the end. Written in non-chronological order as a guise for poor plot construction. Confusing to follow. No action, and less adventure. No visible central conflict between antagonist (minor character) and the protagonist. No character development. I did not care about any of the characters' feelings or situations. Character names impossible to pronounce, even sub-vocally. Somebody tell Mr. Banks that mis-leading the reader (poorly done) into character mis-identification does not work in a novel, only in a movie. In a book, it's a cheap trick. At what point this mistaken identity switch is supposed to have ocurred is unclear. As is the entire story."
1,As the Galaxy Turns,"USE OF WEAPONS (1990 - reprinted 2008) is a ""Space Opera"" far-future SciFi novel, that is part of the Bank's ""Culture"" series.I found the book to be exceedingly dull... it reminded me of watching TV Soap Operas - which I simply don't have any use for either. I couldn't care less about the characters, nor the story.The story and style of writing reminds me of Asimov's ""Foundation Trilogy"" series from the 1950's, but updated to be more ""sexually racy"" for the 1990's audience. Asimov was breaking new ground in the 50's... but this novel adds nothing new, technology-wise."
2,boring,"The majority of the readers have given this book 5 stars which would put this book right next to books like Dune and Ender's Game. That is so far from the truth it's ridiculous.It's okay to love an author but be realistic in your reviews. There is really only 1 character in the story Cheradenine Zakalwe. Cheradenine spends the whole book running from some dreaded memory which is parceled out to you bit by tortuous bit. There is virtually no plot except to display his obvious death wish. There is a big twist at the end but you'll figure that out way before then so it comes as no surprise. Cheradenine is not a Likeable character. There is really no one to like here, there is no action and why so many people rave about this book is beyond me. Do yourself a favor read Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card."
3,Too frequently meanders away from main plot,"A story about a man, this book is an excellent character study. However, the use of flashbacks, memories and retrospective narrative is over-used in my opinion. The main plot really suffers because it remains under-developed due to the frequently disorienting inner monologues and recollections of the protagonist. It's saving grace, particularly as the story limps to the finish line, is a glorious twist that makes much of the meandering, sometimes seemingly pointless introspection pay off. Ultimately though, I was left feeling let down by the lack of dedication to building up a strong and interesting core story."
4,"Good, not great, Culture novel","Just got done eating my way through this one of the Culture Series; which I was only recently turned on to and am enjoying quite well. Anyways, this is a good standalone story for those that may not have read any of the previous books. It's a pretty independent storyline, while providing some conceptual background of the Culture and their ways; nothing really groundbreaking. As it is, I am planning on continuing on through the series, as I have found Mr. Banks's work very good. Of course not near on par as Alastair Reynolds and the Revalation Space Series, but really, who can? I swallow Reynolds's books one at a time, whereas this one I did one chapter a night. Only a few times did I really want to keep going to the next chapter, but nothing was exciting enough to make me break my plan. So, I recommend it certiainly to read, but it would be fine gotten from the library; that's where I'm donating this copy as I wait for the next."
5,YES! This is the greatest SF book ever written!,"This is the ultimate rock and roll space opera to end all space operas. This book is NOT meant to enlighten you, uplift you or in any other way massage your intellectual ego into fawning over how wonderful that nice Mr. Banks must be.It's meant to take you on a searing 300mph ride through the darkest parts of your mind leaving you blistered and burned up.You have to dead on the inside not to get a kick out of this one. After I read it I was so blown away that for 3 days, I could not speak with anyone about it.I have read much SF in my time (Asimov, Bradbury, Dick, Herbert, etc.) and can only say that nothing compares to this piece of work.If you hate rollercoasters stay off this one."
3,Thoughts on Use of Weapons,"While I enjoyed reading Use of Weapons by Banks, like many of the Culture stories you can finish a chapter early and be much happier."
2,A plot timeline is NOT a pretzel!,This could have been an engaging novel had the timeline not resembled a particularly tangled ball of yarn. Also the background on the main character tends to be spotty and deliberately confusing -- all for the sake of obscuring the rather feeble motivation of the main character.
1,very disturbing ending,I hate books that do not end well. I've read two books by this author and they both had depressing endings. This one was especially bad.
2,Only ok,"Some parts of this book were ok, but generally dull and confusing. The suprise? ending was a joke, and the whole thing was forgettable. I have read many much better books."
5,A Real Mind Bender . . .,"Okay, I first happened upon this book in a book store closing--fifty cents. Penny for penny this remains perhaps the best quality novel I've read in the Sci Fi genre.Mind you, this was my first step into Culture. The dry wit of much of it had me rolling and begging my friends to let me read bits to them. I ragged my first copy and bought a second to loan to friends who always come back asking about other novels.Out of print?! No! But, you can't buy it in the US, it seems.One reviewer called it a prezel of a plot. Nope. The book starts in the middle and as it moves on to the end it unravels the plot toward both the beginning and the end. Granted, it did mean that things didn't make as much sense until the end, but that's Iain's game.Play it. Read it."
5,AspectJ In Action is a great AOP introduction,"AspectJ In Action is a great book to use as an introduction to Aspect-oriented Programming. However, AOP is not for developers to whom Java and OO are still new. Without a comfortable understanding of classes, polymorphism, and encapsulation AOP will only further confuse things.With that said, AspectJ In Action is a wonderful book filled with plenty of examples and explanations about the well-lit areas of AOP as well as many of the dark corners. I enjoyed reading this book because it starts out with the fundamentals and works its way to more and more complex uses of AOP without getting bogged down in language tangents. Also, the direct application of AOP in real Java design areas is very helpful in getting a better feel for when and how AOP can be applied.I am looking forward to Ramnivas Laddad's next book!"
5,An Excellent Resource for Learning AspectJ,"This book is an excellent resource for learning AspectJ. It is perfectly organized to take you from beginner, novice, to expert as you move through each of the chapters, just as you might expect if you were taking a class in AspectJ.The author's presentation of the material is straightforward and easy to follow, and his examples are not too involved that you lose track of what's going on. Furthermore, the author has an excellent grasp of the language and is really able to show off the power AspectJ has to offer.What I really appreciate about the book is that he focuses not just on coding, but also on design; I'm a software engineer and am very pleased that the author discusses an aspect as something to be used elegantly, as part of a well-designed system, rather than just another tool that can be abused. He even discusses several new design patterns that AspectJ makes possible.I truly recommend this book!"
5,not the Gamera i remember,"Growing up a sickly kid I spent alot of time in bed watching movies,my faves were the big monsters and of those Gamera was my absolute faverate this movie is different in that it start you off at the beginning egg and all, but you should shelf your ideas of what Gamera was in all those movies and accept this on it's own merrits."
2,another MB fiasco,"*note this review is about the DVD itself not the film* The film itself is not one of my favorite Gamera films, but it is passable, and my kids enjoy it. However the BRD itself suffers from audio problems. At some points you can actually hear background audio from other portions of the film in the wrong place. I have attempted to contact MB/TS multiple times requesting a simple replacement with no response. Other fans have noted this defect making me think it may be on a good portion of the manufactured BRD's if not all. It's so sad that a company that brought us so many fine films in the past 10 years has fallen so far. (feel free to Google MB's issues with Toho and Destroy All Monsters, Godzilla vs Megalon, and tax issues in 2012) Just stick with the DVD if you already have it, no reason to upgrade to BRD since it is defective unless MB publicizes a campaign to replace the defective BRD's"
2,Disapointed,"I watched Gamera as a kid. I also liked the three previous movies. I ordered this because it's not available around here and I wanted to see it. I probably won't watch it again. It is too much for little kids. It's almost sickeningly sweet at times. I rolled my eyes a few times and almost wanted to gag.With that being said, my son did enjoy it and that counts for something."
1,Gamera,"As a fan of Japan monster movies since I was a kid, this one evolved more around the kid than Gamera which took away from the action for which I brought it"
3,Unrealized Potential.,"I enjoyed this movie but I guess I expected more from it than I got. I loved the opening and really most of the story was well thought out but I did not like the Gamera suits. Being a huge fan of the Heisei series (Gamera of the 90's) I guess I really wanted this to be a continuation of that story and it is hard for me to try and enjoy it on its own merit. So for those of you new to the series who want sonething for the family to enjoy this would be a good film. Heisei Gamera fans be warned this is not your Gamera but the next generation and it appears that it is a return to the ""friend of all children"" age which is ok. I just have to get used to it."
2,Great muzzle until it fell apart...,"Pulled apart at the neck sewn reinforcement square on it's 2nd use. I think the strap was not sewn in far enough. I would recommend checking stability of the sewing prior to using. Otherwise a very nice muzzle, comfortable fit for the dog."
2,"Nice pictures, but little content","Make no mistake, the graphics of these notecards are super. The cards are organized very well and many anatomical landmarks are pinpointed.But besides the occasional info about clinically relavent aspects of a particular body part, there are no descriptions about the orgins, innervations, insertions of muscles or any description about arteries or organs. There is a lot of empty space on the back of these cards so that you could take notes for yourself...but that is something that you can judge for yourself if you want to do, since that does take a lot of time.They are great for you to test your ability to identify body parts, but if you don't know anything else about what the functions of the parts, these cards will not help very much."
4,Anatomy review cards helpful,"As someone taking gross anatomy after being out of school for a while, I found these cards helpful for reviewing structures in their anatomical position. Each card has an illustration with 10-20 items identified on the front by number. On the back is the answer key. The beautiful illustrations are accurate and detailed, but in a more modern style than Netter. The detail was right for a graduate level anatomy course. As another reviewer commented, there are no proximal or distal muscle insertions, so if that is what you want than there are other card sets available for that purpose. I used these to review before exams by writing out my answers to ensure I had properly identifed each structure and could spell it correctly."
2,Could (should) have been better,"We are using the Gray's Anatomy textbook for class, and so far I've enjoyed reading and studying from it, so I had high expectations when I explored the flashcards. I was disappointed for 2 main reasons:1. Cards were not punched and a ring was not included for easily taking a small section of cards for portable studying.2. The graphics were pulled straight from the textbook and downsized. In some pictures, the structures became so small that it is worhtless to try and label the structures in the picture. I was confused after looking at a flashcard picture with a pointer seemingly point at nothing, but after referring to the textbook with the larger picture I could see the small structure."
4,Excellent study tool,"The Gray's flashcards provide amazing pictures to study from with an easy to study from format. The only downside to the cards is attempting to keep them organized. The ring that is provided has some positive qualities to it, but it is difficult to use and to hold."
4,Purchased as a gift for a student!!!,"My family has a future nurse who doubted their ability to grasp anatomy and physiology. These flash cards sent them over the top,now expecting to ace the classes."
4,"Good quality, snug fit","The hat quality is great, but it fits tighter than I would have expected. Maybe I shouldn't have bought a fitted hat on the internet."
4,TOP TRACKS BEST STUFF IN YEARS,"The top tracks on this album are the Hip Hop / R&B influenced UP ON THE HILL and LOVE UNLIMITED, and the heavy metal SOUTHSIDE and ALL FOR SELF. These tracks and about 5 others are the best stuff I have heard in years from anybody. They are refreshing, well produced and original while at the same time paying homage to past artists like Barry White. I just wish the group's desire for eclecticism would have prevented the country & western influenced songs from making this otherwise outstanding record as they are grossly out of place. If not for that, this record would easily be 5 star material."
5,This CD is has some hot tunes,"This CD is keeping in tune with their first albulm, and some of the lyrics are amazing. There is a nice mix of Rap and Rock, and this combined with that NYC flava makes this CD a must. My two favourite songs: Love Unlimited and Big Night Out"
4,Give this one a chance,"First time I listened to this one, I was a little dissappointed that it wasn't ""Come Find Yourself"". After a few listens, I realized it's actually better in many ways. And believe it or not, the best songs are actually the ballads! Who would've thought that would be the case from the band that gave us ""Scooby Snacks""?It takes a few listens to really get into this one, but when you do it's well worth it. This disc hasn't been out of my CD player for a couple of weeks now. It's a real gem."
4,Pretty sophisticated stuff,"I'm the only one in my crowd who loves this group, but I LOVE them. This is sophisticated, urban and whimsical ... given the hard, unforgiving edges of street life. But that's the charm of the music ... and it really is skillfully crafted, soulfull music!"
5,A Wonderful Blend,"I'm so glad these guys are still around. Former employees at the Limelight Danceclub, this R&B / HipHop / Garage Rock trio has won the hearts and minds of critcs and the growing number of people listenting to them. One of the best American rock / R&B albums of 1999. Outstanding tracks include ""Back on the Block,"" ""Love Unlimited,"" and the dark, poetic, ""We are all Very Worried about You."""
3,James NOT John was the Beloved Disciple,"Despite the author's title, I believe James was the beloved disciple. Read the scriptures then read from the book of John where he (John) writes about the beloved disciple resting his head on Jesus at the last supper and where the beloved disciple followed behind Jesus. Mention of the last supper is out of place in this passage of John, and John the author would not be boasting for himself, but he would for his brother James."
5,Not to be missed,"This is sonically a gorgeous cd. It's also somewhat diverse, from tracks with deep broad drones folding in on each other, to tracks with diverse melodic interplay like State of Flux. It is also very well produced, with a wide dynamic range that will sound good (as it can) in the car and send shivers down your spine on a better home audio system. As mentioned in an earlier review, this is obtainable (as of now) direct from Robert Rich."
5,Shelli thought,Absolutely excellent for anyone wanting to grow in their understanding how to walk with Jesus.
1,Inedible,"So hard they are unable to be eaten. After sampling two and testing to see if others were just as hard, I ended up throwing all of them in the trash. I'm disappointed that a reputable company would ship an inedible product. I purchased it on sale with free Prime shipping, so I didn't lose much money. I did, however, lose a bit of confidence in amazon.com for making this product available."
3,Pretty Good solid debut,Lisa Stansfield really sounds good on this Disc.All Around The World was the Jam.You can't deny it was tight.this disc had a very strong Barry White Influence.who happens to be Her favorite Artist.The music gets pretty Predictable after a while.but Her voice is no Joke.
5,A Great CD!!!!,"I have listened to and own many of the Lisa Stansfield's other cd's, but ""Affection"" is my absolute all-time favorite of hers! I am still, to this day, blown away by Lisa's vocal skills. She is one of the best singers out there. It's a shame that she hasn't released any new material here in the states in a while, but ""Affection"" fills the void.Of course, my favorite song is ""All Around the World."" I don't care how old the song it, it's still a great song! All of the songs on the cd, for that matter, are great! There's not one bad thing I can say about the cd.Anyone who listens to this cd will not be disappointed. This is definitely a cd to own!!!!!"
5,Outstanding,Lisa's CD Affection is one of my all time favorites. So glad amazon came thru. Been looking everywhere. Thanks again amazon!!!
4,"Good Book, Left Me Wanting...MORE!","I really enjoyed the writng style, the author has a clean, easy style of writing and conveying information. I especially appreciated the wya he broke the node descriptions into the houses they are in. That was a page of the ""cookbook"" you do not often see and added a new twist on the nodal interpretations.That said, I wish there had been more of incorporating the nodes into the rest of the chart. Overall, I DO recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about working with the Nodes of the Moon in their astrological chart."
3,For advanced astrologers,"For advanced astrologers only.I have Kevin Burk's Complete Astrology book and like it quite well. His deft ability to combine astrology, psychology and new age spirituality in plain spoken language is refreshing. I had hoped for more of the same. However, I returned this book because nowhere in the description did it mention that it would be useless in the hands of an amateur astrologer such as myself. Luckily Amazon makes returns painless."
2,it is not really an unpluged version,"If you are a Toto discography collector and you are considering buying this CD... don't do it, if you have Absolutely Live http://www.amazon.com/Absolutely-Live-Toto/dp/B00000J1X0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1252806012&sr=1-3 then you have all the live tracks of this album, then the studio tracks are identical to the ones on many other compilations or main albums, in my specific case I was disapointed of paying almost 40 dollars for an album that didn't provide any unplugged version."
1,My 2nd least favorite of the series,"While this story does have it's good moments and even funny moments, it's rampant anti-gay attitude puts me off completely."
1,Nu-Hope Irrigation Bulb Syringe,"Middle section of bulb part comes apart within 2 months of usage (I ordered 2 of these items & both came apart within the same time frame. Do NOT buy this product - comes from China, another inferior product."
2,Wrong color discription,"This was a nice sweater however the color was a light coral. I would not call it RUBY. If it had been real red or dark red as in 'ruby"" it would have worked. However the color did not go with ny skin tone.Devon & Jones Pink Stretch Everyday Cardigan Sweater, XL, Ruby"
1,Worst case ever,"After looking around for a credit card case for my iphone 4, i ended up purchasing this one. For the price i expected a high end product.Unfortunately what i got in the end was a cheap knockoff of the case-mate version.After 2 months use, the color is wearing off (i got the black one, and red plastic is showing), and the cards are now loose (i only use 2). additionally the case is warped so that it is not snug at the top end of the case.After complaining to boxwave, they sent a new one, and it was just as bad.To be frank, this case is probably the 1$ case from ebay, in a 20 something $ box, with boxwave's logo on it.If it had cost me a few bucks i would be happy with it, but for the price i paid, i feel cheated.Mark"
4,wonderful,"I have just begun reading the book, I find the material interesting, and hard to put down."
3,Strainer Lid lasted exactly 2 years.,"Pump seems to be working fine...however, the strainer lid 'exploded' after exactly two years of use. Replacementapproximately $30. My Hayward lasted 10+ years. Live and learn"
1,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this Wayne pool pump. It arrived within days and I installed it. It started leaking immediately. I called the company and they were very helpful. They actually sent me another one within a day. They said keep the first one for parts. The second one leaked right through the housing of the impeller area. The company could not believe what was going on, nor could I. They offered to send me another pump, but I told them no thank you, and I got off my wallet, and bought a Hayward, as I should have done in the first placed. The Hayward was 100 dollars more, but worth every penny. The old saying, ""you get what you pay for"" is so true. Will I ever learn? Amazon was great about refunding my first pump purchase. I sent it back and Amazon took care of the refund in a matter of days. I offered to send the second pump back to Wayne, but they said they did not want it,(I don't blame them)."
4,Unmissable,"A marvelous edition, both in content and design! What a shame the odorama card is missing in this recent edition! Not five-star rated because of it."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","The older films were a bit rough, as would be expected. Much of the acting is just awful, but that is the charm of the movies in some respects. I am glad that I got this set, but would hesitate to recommend it."
5,Expected,"Very Patti Smith-like! Had this on vinyl, tape, and now CD. Worth every penny. If you are a fan, this is a must have."
3,Strangely Weak,"I bought ""Wave"" just two months ago and -although it's a too short time to judge objectively and despite the fact that I am a new fan and so a Patti-addicted at the moment- I am disappointed in it. I own all Patti's albums (except ""Dream of life"") and ""Wave"" seems to be the least impressive at first glance, but this consideration concerns mainly the music and its execution. But, as far as the lyrics are concerned, I think that no album is better this (of course, except the brilliant-illuminating ""Horses""). So if I had to judge, I would give 3 stars out of 5, but if I could I would give 2.5."
3,Wish it was called Horsies.,Patti Smith has enough talent to justify her narcissism and this album is as good as the first two in it's own way.
3,meh,"I have a couple problems with this light. The first it that it's not LED, but I didn't expect it to be lol. This kind of bulb is outdated. The second problem is related to the first. I put in a CR123a rechargeable battery, which is about 1V higher than the stock battery. This little increase killed the bulb. This was a bummer.Third, I don't like the tailcap. The momentary on feature feels clumsy. The twisty on is nice though. I like the adjustable focus, it feels very solid. It's also easy to insert a 5mm LED as a temporary bulb, though it is nowhere near as bright as the halogen (the halogen is still only 30 lumens)."
4,Faucet,"This is a very nice faucet. The price was good, too. The installation was easy and it looks great. Be careful of cleaning it, especially the pop up drain, which will lose the finish easily."
4,Great product; absolutely TERRIBLE UPS service,"These are beautiful, better than the pictures! However, they were supposed to be delivered overnight via UPS. 5 !!!! days later, they were located (???) and arrived. I will never buy another product where UPS is the designated shipper."
4,"Works, but not as well as my old one","I had an old computer-- (a 2000 Gateway/Win XP) that recently died. Since I had save all my work from old programs on the Zip Discs I didn't think it would be such a problem - hey, I'll just get the USB Zip Drive - Wellll. It appears Win 7 doesn't like ol' zip drives - enter Virtual PC XP Mode. Now I can sort of get my old stuff - but it's like pulling teeth and the drive is quite noisy - hope it lasts long enough to get the stuff off the discs. We'll see"
2,There are better choices available,"The ZIP 250 I've used for about a year is OK I guess but it's very slow and the ""spin down"" time when flipping back and forth between computers (which I do a lot) is quite long and sometimes it gets ""stuck"" and wont shut down on some of my Win2000 servers which is really annoying.Went out and got a Jump Drive 2.0 which holds 250 meg, is MUCH faster, more reliable and nicer to use... I'd recommend that - and DEFINITELY steer clear of the ZIP 750 - that thing is just awful - ended up sending it back after it locked my File Explorer on several computers. I notice Amazon doesn't even offer that, probably for good reason. The new ""flash"" media is a much better choice than these external drives."
4,nice,"I spent several days trying to decide if i should buy anexternal CDR/W or USB Zip for fast file sharing betweensevral desktops & laptops.. Eventhough Zip disks are veryexpensive (ridiculously) as compared to CD-R and CDrws, zip drives are REALLY plug & play.. we have Win2K- desktops at workand I didn't even need to install the drivers i just plug it in without rebooting!! wow..By the way I think 100 MB USB is more than enough for everyday purposes, except if you deal with lots o graphics..but then u better get something faster like a FIrewire or USB 2.0 swappable HD/ CDrw.."
1,returned because does not work with windows 7,"wish they had written that in product description; would have saved a lot of trouble.had to return it, and still dont have my photos from a few years ago off my zip discs."
1,Unending Trouble with Mac,This drive is WAY more trouble than it is worth.The drive won't come up on the desktop of my iBook and the iomega tech help barely speaks english. The help that they gave was worthless and I am seriously considering putting this piece of junk up on an auction site just to see the back end of it.
2,Not Dependeble,"I have owned this item for a little less than a year and since I have owned it I have been having problems. The first thing is I used the 250mb disk to back up pictures that I used for photo editing and everytime I load the disk to retreive the pictures it freezes up. My computer doesn't have that problem with any other drive. When using the zip drive I always run into problems when transferring files from zip->hard drive and hard drive->zip. I have an older model at the office (100 mb) and is not USB connected and is very dependable. No freezing, no reboots! It is a little more bulkier but does the job way better than this model."
5,Very Good Drive,"I bought this drive a week ago. First it came very fast. Also it was very easy to install. I just inserted the provided CD with IomegaWare driver, then it said restart your computer and insert the zip drive in your USB slot. I did that and Windows 98 automaticaly recognized it and installed the driver. It writes very fast and you can password protect your disks. Only one problem is that the zip disks are a little too expensive but I can manage. Very good buy!"
4,It was Roxio's problem!,"I've upgraded my rating from 2 to 4. It turns out ""Take Two 5.0"" was the primary culprit with the slow boot and was the sole offender for the need to have a zip disk inserted to start Windows 2000 at all. Anyone using Roxio's Easy CD Creator Platinum 5.0 that installed Take Two should visit the [website] to download and install the 5.01 and 5.01s updates! I also found that once I unplugged my 3Com HomeConnect PC camera from my Entrega 4 port usb hub, I didn't stay on the boot screen for 10 minutes. Time to dump Entrega and find newer, higher-powered hubs, I guess."
3,Does the job (but not too impressively!),"I bought this parallel port version so that I can transfer from my office PC to my older home non-USB PC as well as to and from other family members' PCs. I know most of them don't have USB ports. The versatility was more important that the speed. The Parallel Port Zip Drive does the intended job but it interferes with my work while it is being used. It locks up the machine for a number of minutes and transfers much slower than its stated transfer rate. So while I don't necessarily regret buying it, I do wish it worked better and at least as quickly as it has been rated to do. I also am now considering buying a RW-CD to do most of my work and only use the Parallel Port Zip when absolutely necessary."
1,Nightmare !!,"It is appalling to see that amazon is keeping such redundant items on its site. It was a mistake on my part to order this because i thought this was a 250GB hard drive.. whereas it turned out to be a 250MB USB drive !!! Its a dinosaur in the present world.. i'd like to warn consumers to read the fine print carefully before buying tech items. While some companies may try to push old redundant products in their inventory, hopefully a renowned site like amazon.com would refrain from carrying such products in the near future."
4,"Meets my expectations, works with my laptop","Great! Only needed something for backing up Quicken data, etc. and keep personal data off the laptop C drive. I was concerned about the one review that says that the laptop USB supply was not ""high power"" and it slowed the system, but I didn't have this problem at all. Works great on my IBM T20. (Although I read elsewhere that you might have problems on a Toshiba laptop). Not quite as fast as a HDD of course, but easily fast enough for my purposes. Backs up my 4MB Quicken file in about 5 seconds, and I can work right off the drive without any noticable delay. Only complaints are the approx 8 second start-up delay, and the noise - kind of a high-pitched whine - but you can't beat the price!"
5,A keeper,"It makes a hell of a racket when you fire up your computer, but the IOMEGA 31310 Zip 250 is well-worth the momentary ruckus. We have had ours for over two years now and have not a single problem. I use it for storing my novels and for my teaching purposes; my wife uses it to store hundreds upon hundreds of her photographic works. Neither one of us are computer savvy but this drive was easy to set up and brainless to use. I plan on keeping this for a long while, although, as another reviewer has mentioned, CD storage is going to be the way of the future. So be it. Until then, the IOMEGA 31310 Zip 250 will be our storage facility of choice."
2,why bother?,"USB ""keychain drives"" can store 64 or 128 MB for much less money, and they're quicker and more reliable (no moving parts) to boot. If you have more data to store, use a CD/RW drive, they're both cheaper, bigger, and more portable.The Iomega zip drive is stuck - on the bottom, use a keychain drive. on the top, use a CD/RW drive."
1,Very disappointed,I was not aware that this zip drive is incompatible with Windows 7.It ate one of my zip discs and I cannot use it.
1,ZIP,It did not work. I do not know if the problem was the ZIP drive or my computer. The ZIP did not work on a friend's computer. S
3,Zip Drive,"Unfortunately, I had to purchase this product because of legacy media I owned. I would have preferred not to, but it does function well."
4,Replacing one that died,"The 250 MB Zip drive is a nice product and fills an important need. But I'm replacing one that died after about 3 years. I think they should last longer than that!The drive makes backing up work very simple and I wouldn't dare work without one, or a similar product."
1,Piece of Junk,"This piece of equipment didn't work well with my system, a Windows (ME) PC with Athlon processor. I hoped to use it to transfer files between computers at home and work. It didn't handle 100 Meg Zip disks very well, locking up the system on occasion. I returned it and replaced it with a standard Zip drive, which works fine. Not recommended."
2,Not a good product,"It's noisy, it's slow and it often hangs up, trying to access the disk over and over again, sometimes for several minutes before it connects. Maybe I got a bad one, but it sucks."
4,Zip 250 drive and Vista,"The drive works fine with either Windows XP or Vista (which surprised me). It helps me keep track of documents and photos without using cds. The fact that it is re-usable, ""defraggable"", as well as portable is a great plus"
1,"Problems, Problems, Problems","This ZIP drive worked fine for a while and then just ceased to function so I returned the drive to Iomega for a replacement. The ... unit that was sent worked ""OK"", at best, with occasional glitches (an especially annoying ""churning"" of the drive as it attempts to recognize the disk). This unit finally ceased to function as well, drive isn't recognized at all. I've given up and will search for another alternative to this product."
4,A great drive but disks are quite expensive,"I love this drive, very easy to install (windows auto detects and installs quite nicely). Being USB akes it very easy to travel with and can be used anywhere and on any computer with a USB port.Now the downside....The disks are quite expensive (About 10x more than a CDRW for way less storage).If you are hoping to use the drive to restore systems files from at startup... forget it, you will need the serial port version of the Zip drive to do that.This is an excellent solution for someone who needs to share files between multiple computers.For pure backup of data however, A CDRW is a more cost effective solution...."
2,Doesn't work with most notebooks,"I gave this 2 stars since I thought this would be the perfect external drive for traveling with my notebook book but failed to work with my notebook. When I tried to install this on the USB port of my notebook, it caused my notebook to slow its performance to a crawl. I later figured out that this drive needs a ""high power"" USB port. For those that don't know, there are ""high power"" and ""low power"" USB ports. There is nothing on the box of this drive that says it only works on high power USB ports. Not only that, Windows doesn't report the problem back to the user. What a waste of time and money. I later found out that Iomega makes a PC Card that is a high power USB port so that you can use this drive. Gad! What good is USB if it is not ""universal""."
3,mystic topaz earrings,"The earrings were of good quality and very nice in that the stones were brilliant and not cloudy and they were set in delicate 14k gold. The size of the oval stones, however, was most disappointing in that I expected them to be much bigger. I did know the size in mm, and thought it would be ok, but they turned out to be less than a pencil eraser in oval!! Still, the receiver does like them as it is fortunate she is small and dainty and the size is all right with her. I don't think it was the best value as I have seen other mystic topaz earrings that looked comparable and cost considerably less."
3,a little bummed,"I had done this original Bible study almost 10 yrs ago and am now in the ""revised"" version. I thought this book would have a lot more info involved than the Bible study. There really isnt all that much difference. If you are not doing, or it has been awhile since you have done the study, this is for you. If you are a Beth Moore junky like myself, you may be a smidge dissapointed. I also got from the library the 90 day version of this. it is the same thing, just done in a 90 day format, so I was hit with repetition from 3 spots! Yes, getting it from multiple places probably made me retain easier, but I was just looking for well Moore! (pun intended!)"
5,A Heart like his,This is a study book that helps you to understand the background of David and I am going through a bible study right now using this book.
5,A Great CD!,"This is agreat CD made by a great musician/song writer. The more I hear it, the more I like it. Intelligent rock music is a rare and precious thing."
2,Better luck next time...,"Awesome seller, fast & friendly.Wouldn't hit a lame dog in the behind with this recording, though.Sounds like AM radio!"
1,BORING!!!,"Don't get me wrong, Kerry's a GREAT songwriter and musician, but this album does nothing. ""Seeds Of Change"" is great, and so is ""One Of Several Possible Musiks"", but this is no good. Every now and then, you hear some interesting riffs. I you're a Livgren collector, be my guest. If you're exploring, try the two that I mentioned."
4,FAMILY ANGST,"IMAGINARY HEROES is an engrossing, if somewhat bleak, look at a typical American family that is devastated when the oldest son, a star swimmer, takes his own life. The reactions of his siblings range from extreme grief (the parents) to a somewhat apathetic acceptance (his brother and sister). Dan Harris' script takes some unexpected turns, and somehow seem a little ""cheap"" by the end, but nonetheless, he has crafted a sturdy tale of emotional ambivalance. His talented cast also helps: Emile Hirsch as the brother whose own sexual confusion and feelings of unacceptance come to surface; Sigourney Weaver as his upbeat mother who tries to establish some kind of communication with her family; Jeff Daniels is superb as the father whose obsessive love has underlying motivations. Not always easy to watch, IMAGINARY HEROES joins films like ORDINARY PEOPLE in trying to show the devastative impact of suicide."
1,My fast forward button got the ultimate workout!,"I happen to like slow-paced movies (Barry Lyndon, Once Upon A Time In The West) but found Imaginary Heroes unfocused and aimless. I can imagine the pitch echoing around the studio's corner offices: It's going to be American Beauty meets Virgin Suicides meets Royal Tenenbaums! Hip young director! We can't miss, guys! Regrettably, while talented actors gamely tackle Big Dramatic Scene after Big Dramatic Scene, this project misses by miles. At least viewing I.H. on DVD enables one to bring the proceedings to a rapid conclusion. To Mr. Harris: Nice try, kid."
3,"Great flick, off the wall.","Certainly would have NEVER rented this one if I never saw it on cable. Movie looks at the life of a normal everyday family. The struggles they face, ups and downs, etc. I noticed Emile Hirsch from The Girl Next Door"" in this movie, he is the main reason i bought it. Something about this guy and how he acts in movies, he's really good. Worth the cash if you like the actors in this."
3,Overrated,"Imaginary Heroes is a classic example of parts being better than the whole. The dysfunctional suburbian nuclear family card is overplayed as it is, and this movie - in which Ms. Weaver does indeed shine (and we'd expect no less) and which does provide several moments for both laughs and sighs - tries to pack in just too much in its 107 minutes. We are swept from one tragedy to another, from one substance abuse to the next, and one form of dysfunction to another with little cohesion and credibility. Due to the author's age, it is far from a terrible flop, still the overbloated reviews on here are undeserved. Especially the juvenile reviewer before me with its sudden but naive epiphany about indie movies."
3,Inferior to North American version,"Microsoft AutoRoute Europe 2007 provides the same mapping services and Microsoft's Streets & Trips (North American) application, but with annoying bugs. Exploring an area (zooming, selecting, panning) has caused me to crash often. Some restaurants remain displayed even though I have unchecked the restaurants box on Show/Hide places. Some minor roads that show up on Internet mapping sites for Europe, such as Mappy or ViaMichelin, aren't included in AutoRoute. And I have had it advise me to leave a controlled-access major highway where no exit existed to follow a phantom ""local road"" into downtown Cordoba."
3,Difficult if you aren't carefull,"Hi all. This software both SUCKS and is GREAT. The diffuclty is in Overpasses and off ramps. It gets easily confused with you being ""On Route"" and ""Off Route"". OFTEN it would tell us to turn right, or ""Take Local Road"", and we would miss our turn. What was GREAT about the software was being able to locate yourself on the map, and tell what you really needed to do. Navigation is a little clunky, and takes some getting use to. We used this software in Germany and a little bit of Switzerland. The other options was a Garmin with Europe Maps, for Hundreds of dollars, or this simple program. We utilized the ""Microsoft GPS received"" that comes with their US product. It did allow for printing of maps, and was worth the price paid. HOWEVER do not think that you can simply jump in the car and use this as a 100% navigation aid."
5,I bought Autoroute as insurance and now live by it,"I used streets and trips for a few years on a now 6 year old IBM T42 and Dell Studio 15. I travelled the SW and NE US and Maritime Canada on 3000 mile vacations and never had a problem. I moved to Europe(CH) last year and bought the autoroute maps as a backup to the Navi in my car. We don't even turn the Navi on, because Autoroute with the old S&T GPS receiver is the best tool for planning and on the fly trip modeling. We've been through Belgium, the eastern half of France, western half of NL, southern Ireland, all of Germany south of Nuremburg, all of Italy north of Rome and half of Switzerland and have found very few map errors, most were due to recent construction to change roads. It takes a minimum of navigational skill (my 11 year old guided us for 2000 Km around Germany for a week)and didn't make any mistakes. If you can drive a car you can use this product."
3,Microsoft AutoRoute Europe 2007,AutoRoute with GPS receiver worked well in Italy. The only problem I had is that it does not automatically re-route when I miss a turn.
4,"Almost as good as Streets and Trips, but not quite.","This is a good, basic routing program. The interface is similar to Microsoft Streets and Trips but the data base is lacking. There is a serious deficiency when it comes to street names in the less urban areas. This program will serve you well in traveling major roads between cities and it will serve you well in locating streets in urban centers. but if you need to find your way around the countryside, it won't be of much help."
3,Buggy; hard to navigate,"You can't hide all places - that is a minor annoyance. The real problem is that it creates driving directions that are impossible to follow. ""Local road, name changes to local road for 184 yards,"" for example."
3,Could be better,"Hi,I bought this software because I am taking a trip to England soon.The software is ok, but it could be better, I am not a fan of the zoom. You have to go up to a zoom bar to adjust. I also own Delorme Street Atlas and I fing that software much easier to use from a functionality standpoint. To Zoom in the Delorme you drag a box, or stairstep out. (I know that isn't clear, but once you do it it's easy)However the price on the Autoroute is what sold me. I will be using it for about one week, and will probably never use it again. The fact it sets up with a GPS is very cool, I am a fan of using a laptop as a GPS device, I will never get a pocket size one."
3,Fair Europen maps,"Purchased this prior to a trip to Amsterdam and Germany. We intended to drive around Germany for week. Having used the US version with great results, I was a bit dissapointed with the outcome of this program. Our intention was to travel the roads less used through small towns but found that it did not seem to have the same level of information as the US counterpoint. Since my Garmin has maps of Europe in it, we ended up just using it from town to town.Would think about purchasing this version."
2,Greece not covered,Purchased this product because it was the only GPS software that claimed to cover Greece. Well if you are going from Athens to Cornith it looks like it will work well. Don't try to go to any smaller towns. Not covered. Well there goes 40 bucks
2,Useless for Eastern Europe!!,"Microsoft AutoRoute Europe 2007I purchased this product specificly for Slovakia & The Ukraine. They don't show any roads in these areas. The description led me to believe that Microsoft had improved these areas. I've used Microsoft Streets since its inception, and I was very disappointed to see what a poor job they did with the Europe version."
4,Magic Dragon Theater,"This is ""some"" of the best work from TR and Utopia, Period. But then again, it was the late 70's, and I was dating MaryJane. If your into a progressive/different sound, you will like this album. Although some songs haven't stood the 'test of time' as well as other 70's music. Regardless, RA is ancient worlds apart from anything you've heard. I saw the light.If anybody knows where to find a poster of the RA CD cover, please let me know"
3,RA has not withstood the test of time I'm sorry to say...,"The funny thing is, I used to love all of the Utopia stuff back in the day, but today it just sounds horribly dated. For anyone who is looking for a place to start for Todd Rundgren/Utopia I would suggest the 1980 album ""Adventures In Utopia"", or Todd solo records 1989's ""Nearly Human"" or the pop/rock masterpiece ""Something/Anything?This is not to say that RA does not have some good points, but c'mon, ""Singring And The Glass Guitar""? Unless you are a teenager who has a tendacy for pot smoking and listening to Rush, I do not think you will fully appreciate this stuff."
2,self indulgent silliness,"I love Todd Rundgren and respect all of his talents. He must have had a lot of clout to make this absurd work.The musicianship is stunning and there are some great melodies but it is still a silly, goof yconcept album. The chorus from Hiroshima? Todd what were you thinking?There are enough hooks here that Utopia could have crafted real songs. To someone other than a Utopia fanatic, this is unlistenable."
1,Audrey 's worst film!!!,"How Sheldon's wonderful novel was turned into such a bad (and very boring) movie is a mystery. Good cast (Hepburn, Mason, Schneider) wasted...Buy the book instead!!!"
5,"Suspenseful, Sexy, Mason/Gazarra Worthy Adverseries","James Mason and Ben Gazarra were still virile and energetic enough to pull it off as two middle-aged adverseries for the eternally charming Audrey Hepburn. Enjoy it for what it is, a straightforward, by-the-numbers suspense thriller with plenty of '70s fashion and atmosphere. The ending, where Hepburn must decide to believe either Mason or Gazarra, is great. Mason's 1978-79 performances in ""The Boys from Brazil"" and ""Salem's Lot"" and here made for a notable trifecta of quality acting."
1,Very bad Movie,"This was a very disappointing movie. Both James Mason and Audrey Hepburn, both very great stars, were totally miscast for the content of this motion picture. The explicit sex scenes were a total distraction from the plot, and not needed at all. Sidney Sheldon needed to know better. I can understand why Ms. Hepburn wanted out of this movie, when she learned what was to be filmed, but her contract bound her to this film."

3,Facts and Fancies About Germany,"Gollancz's largely forgotten book details the suffering of Germans in the early years of the Allied occupation. While the story is poignant and Gollancz's humanitarianism commendable,the data in the book has to be approached with caution. Historian John Farquharson showed that some of Gollancz's statistics on disease and hunger were exaggerated or distorted. The statistics published at the time by the British Medical Journal show a situation that was serious but not quite as grim as the picture painted by this book. Gollancz's charge that the Allies were starving Germans may have been outdated. According to official statistics,the British and American zones were getting over a quarter of a million tons of food per month in 1946."
2,A book filled tons of mistakes.,"I am a student, practicing independently for the SAT. I bought this book because it had decent reviews on amazon. I have to say that this book has some terrible mistakes that can't be even called typos. I took only the first practice test, and I akready discovered grammatical errors on the verbal and writing sectios that are supposed to test on the same mistakes! Some of the answers are poorly explained and some reading passages do not (at all) adhere to the real SAT format- questioons on these passages are usually very ambiguous.On the other side, I believe this is the best practice test SAT book on the market other than the Officail SAT Guide. If one runs out of the ""real"" questions, not many decent practice test options are left..."
4,Excellent Explanations,"I just recently bought this book and it is definetely worth the money for those who are preparing for SAT/PSAT in general. Although it might contain some lapses in grammar and few recycled questions, its format strongly adheres to the actual SAT. The questions, not least the Critical Reading questions are very good. What stands out, however, are its insightful explanations of how to approach each type of reading question and why each of the other choices are wrong. Plus, with 12 complete tests, it offers a comprehensive preparation for the exam. This book, combined with the Official SAT book (whose questions I consider a bit easier than the actual exam), will make an excellent preparatory material."
2,Kaplan-not the best,"I used this book exclusively in my tutoring sessions I provided for inner city kids. However due to a lack of improvement in my student's scores, I decided to switch over to the far more superior Princeton Review guide books."
5,kleine haie so true hello all actors,"great movie hard too get but sooo funny try to get it you ll go into fits. all the sarcasm we ""wanna be actors"" have always looked for!!"
1,(...)where are the Adicts?,This album blew.. It was way weak. Nothing like the classic Adicts sound. Dont buy this. Its a good thing i only have burned copy.
5,"If you Play, BUY THIS DVD! If you don't, learn by this DVD!","OK, as one reviewer wrote, they do spend some time with the camera on the keyboard and drummer, and yes, even the bass player. That's why it is called the Walter Trout Band! Walter's band is tight in this video, as he is in all of his CD's I have heard. If you have even tried to pick up an ax and play or if you are an accomplished player, BUY THIS DVD. Walter is one of the best guitar players ever and even if this concert is getting into the OLD box, it is just pure Walter Trout. Stuff it in your big screen and turn up the surround sound and see what a guitar God can do for 60 minutes!"
5,"Great paint, very cool effect.","This paint is fantastic. The cans are equipped with those nice fan nozzles which made it very easy to get good even coats. I would recommend ordering at least 2 kits for mid to large size projects. I ordered one kit to finish a guitar and used the entire can of mid coat and clear coat. I probably would have ran out of base coat as well if I hadn't already primed. The color shift effect is as advertised when you follow the directions, but note that for a really nice shift you need to apply many mid coats. This paint dries very fast though, so applying multiple coats does not take long at all."
5,Great product for the price,"Bought it for my husband and so far he thinks it is just as good as the higher priced ones, at least for what we use it for. My husband installed it into our Toy Hauler and it works great!"
2,Hose Reel,This is a well-built product for the price. I've had one hanging in my garage for just over a year and have had no problems with the ratcheting feature. However the hose has developed cracks and is now leaking. After discovering the hose leaking I carefully inspected it and found several cracks along the length of the hose. The reel is not longer a good deal if you have to replace the hose within a year...I also have a version of this reel made by Cyclone Pneumatic hanging in my shop for about three years and have had no issues with it.
5,If Rod Stewart had read William Burroughs,"The late Eighties was not a particular great time for Rock Music, with a lot of Glam Metal seeping in from the U.S, with a overproduced sound & deposable lyrics.The Dogs were the exception to the rule, with a plug in & play attitude to studio production, & really articulate lyrics.If I have to describe their sound, musically The Faces, words Bob Dylan.They had a run of five strong albums, this probably just about being the best, with Tyla hitting a creative peak at just the right timeI do think it's about time they re-released all their back catalogue, with extra tracks.Other Dogs Da'mour albums worth listening to:(Un) Authorised Bootleg (1988) ****In The Dynamite Jet Saloon (1988) ****A Graveyard of Empty Bottles (1989) *****King Of The Thieves, released as ""Errol Flynn"" in the UK (1989) *****Straight (1990) ****More Unchartered Heights of Disgrace (1993) ***Happy Ever After (2001) ****"
1,Please remember your manners when writing about manners!,"I am most disappointed with ""How to Raise a Gentleman"" by Kay West. The beginning was promising with concise ""rules"" and practical examples to explain them. Unfortunately, around the midpoint of the book the author appears to forget her purpose...and her manners. Vulgar vocabulary and excessively described, equally vulgar situations take the place of previously delicate and succinct wording. Readers hoping to improve their overall etiquette and social standing do not need to be reminded of the multitude of slang terms used in place of more socially correct, tactful terms. Sadly this is not the first ""etiquette"" book I have had this experience with. Etiquette authors: please edit and publish your work with higher standards and the intelligence of your readers in mind."
1,Not a great book,There is no great advice in this book. Just a lot of common sense. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,It really was helpful.,"I gave this five stars because this book was an easy read and not only gave me the just of what my son should be doing but also a generalization of how my personal actions/reaction/non-action might be affecting the desired outcome. Some might read it a say well duhhh but if everything was that simple how come everyone isn't doing it. I had to make some minor tweaks to myself and I can see the differance. Being an easy read also helped because we were able to read it together. Sometimes my son thinks that I am the only one saying some of these things but when he reads it in print something clicks ""maybe my parent isn't crazy""????"
3,A condensed musical version of the book.,"This movie is plenty entertaining for those who haven't read the book. We read the book as a novel study and then watched the movie as a follow-up comparison. There is no way to combine all of E.B. White's descriptive talents into a 70 minute movie. There was not a lot of character development which is one of White's strong points, but there are enough silly jokes and new wacky characters to entertain kids. The movie hits the major events of the book, but also lacks critical components that tie everything together. Not a critically acclaimed movie, but plenty of musical fun on a Sunday afternoon."
1,Read the book - skip this movie!,"""The Trumpet of the Swan"" was my favorite childhood book, and I was excited to see that it was being turned into an animated movie. I finally saw it on PPV, and was very disappointed in how much they deviated from the original story, and in the overall quality of the movie. As others have stated, the animation was poor, and the quality of the audio was terrible, too, as I couldn't understand much of the dialog.While it may appeal to the very young, I can't see how anyone over the age of 6 or 7 could enjoy the movie. Do yourself - and your kids - a favor and buy the book rather than subject them to this film."
1,Absolutly HORRIBLE!,"This video is an a poor representation of even the SPIRIT of the book, and a total (...) job by everyone involved. Shoddy production, top to bottom, with poor vocal casting, poor storytelling skills, complete lack of character, awful animation, and ugly color. Oh--and where were the directors? The worst thing about this film is that it talks down to kids--all while boring adults like myself. AVOID at all costs."
3,worth the price,I recommend this but changing from subtitles of spanish to English and vice versa was a chore ; that needs fixed.
4,Great for ALL children!,I would recommend this for all children who appreciate music. My grand-baby plays it over and over!
5,Heartwarming and just plain nice movie for kids.........,My 3 1/2 year old son loves this movie. It is genuine and cute. I'd recommend it as a great addition to any family video collection.
3,Not as good as Charlotte's Web,"Charlotte's Web is the only movie my 3 year old son has taken any interest in. He watches it over and over. I love Charlotte's Web too, but I've been looking for another movie that he likes equally well. I thought a movie based on a book written by the same author would be just the thing. Nope. He took Trumpet of the Swan out midway through and put Charlotte's Web in. I'll admit that I didn't like it nearly as much either. I didn't find the animation and audio objectionable ( 3 year olds don't care), but the story just seemed a little slow. This movie will probably sit on the shelf."
5,E. B. White Fan Finally Satisfied,"It was with some hesitancy and fairly low expectations that I put Trumpet of the Swan into my VCR. The creators of former screenplays inspired by E. B. White's books have turned literary masterpieces into cinema that leaves the viewer unsatisfied at best and most likely thoroughly disgusted by the unhallowed cinematic treatment of White's literary brilliance. This attempt, however, left me pleasantly surprised. The changes in storyline are minimal and appropriate for moving this work from book to movie format. The animation is lighthearted yet aesthetically pleasing. The vocal talent, particularly of Jason Alexander, is impressive. In short, this is one video adults can thoroughly enjoy along with their children, especially if they have had the pleasure of reading White's book together prior to viewing it."
4,Great For Young Kids,This was a very entertaining movie ... Both my 4 and 6 year old girls really enjoyed it. My 6 year old often gets scared during several parts of movies (particularly disney movies which typically have a villian) but did not get scared in this movie. I stayed awake the whole time too ;-).
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this DVD for my fourth grade class. We read the novel, and then watched the movie. The movie is loosely based on the book, and is awful. The animation looks cheap, and the swans all have weird halloween wig like hairstyles. The music is bad, despite having a good cast. I bought this movie after reading other reviews saying how terrible it was, and hope to save someone else disappointment. The positives were that the students enjoyed it, and it worked well for comparing and contrasting. Don't waste your money; rent it on Netflix."
4,Good for Children,"I think this was a very cute movie. My granddaughter read the book 6 months ago and loved it. She just tuned 9 this month and I gave her the movie. She loved it just as much as the book. I was not looking for a great movie but was very happy with it. It was fun for my granddaughter to tell me the parts that were not just like the book. I was able to explain to her that most of the time, movies are not just like the books they are made about. I was also able to use this moment to tell her that it is always best to read a story because a book can explain more in words than an movie can show on the screen. It was a nice way for me to push the point about how good reading is for her."
1,Awful Rug,"The color is green NOT blue, seller couldn't care less. It is a dark forest green, feels hard and not a nice soft feel under your feet"
4,"An exhaustive, but aging, how-to guide to backpacking","Colin Fletcher's book on hiking has been a classic for decades. Not only does he cover just about every aspect of life on the trail, he does it with an entertaining, anecdotal style that is a step above most other books of its type. The book is about due for an update, though. There have been so many changes in backpacking equipment over the years that Fletcher's discussions on stoves, tents, and water purification systems(to name a few) are just plain outdated. Too bad. Still, it's the most readable guide to backpacking out there, and his hints and tricks on wilderness travel remain as fresh and useful as ever."
4,Really good Crime/thriller,Acting - goodStory - goodOver all- goodIf you like action/crime/thriller movies you really should see this movie. Its one of may favorite.
4,Stallone's Finest Moment,"The 1981 release saw Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee Williams in a police thriller based in New York City during the ""endless"" party of the Disco-era.Stallone - as Det. Deke DaSilva - and Williams - as Det. Matthew Fox - are in pursuit of an international terrorist, portrayed masterfully by Rutger Hauer, who gets lost in the masses in the city. The search becomes personal as DaSilva's wife - played by Lindsay Wagner - is targeted to be killed by the terrorist.It is not a shoot-'em-up, as the well-paced scenes take the audience onto the streets and into the discos and subways. The near miss in the club - with the crush of dancers, pulsating beat and the urgency of the hunter(s) and the hunted - is especially dynamic.In some ways a period piece for the genre, Nighthawks arguably is the finest work by Stallone and holds up after all these years because you are apprehending the terrorist with the detectives."
2,Good Film - Poor DVD,"I remember watching and enjoying this film when it was originally released. I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD.First of all, this film deserves a wide screen transfer. Instead, they give us a poor full screen transfer, which shows a good deal of grain and appears soft in areas. The print or original material's used for the transfer are not in the best of shape and this is very noticeable on the transfer with respect to scratches, nicks and abrasions.Unless you really love this film, I would suggest passing on this DVD."
2,Doesn't hold up well,"I always loved this movie. Decided to buy it and savoy the experience again. Very disappointing. Just didn't hold up to the test of time...Even friends watching it for the first time figured out the twist and that was always a highlight in the past. Plus, the picture quality was fair at best and the video had a flaw on the transfer from film. The vendor issued a prompt refund so kudos to them."
3,"Disappointed, But read on","Sly Stallone & Billy Dee Williams are decoy cops,recuited to hunt and stop terrorist. Ruger Hauer,is an outcast terrorist looking to make a point andget back into the good graces of head terrorists.This is a well paced, action-packed film I reallyenjoyed when it came out . . . now for the down-sideI got this not only because I enjoyed the movie butalso Keith Emerson's riveting soundtrack, that addedto the overall pace of the film. Getting this versionof the movie on DVD, I find that several key momentsin the film the music had been changed from theorginal soundtrack to a much lesser intense tone.Including the key moment when Stallone ID's Hauerin the midst of a disco hall.I was considering sending the movie back becauseof this, but I still like the film overall.But this is the kind of thing that people shouldbe made aware of before buying a film.It would be like the classic Jaws music being replacedwith the Tchailkovsky's "" Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."""
3,They lose some ground on this one...,"I really hate to say this, really, but this was not close to the best of FAMILY GUY. There are laughs, but not like before. I agree with other reviewers that it is lacking an edge. I wish now that FOX had brought back FUTURAMA back instead."
1,Don't have the DVD and won't,"I, like others, love ""Family Guy"" but this season was a wash. The jokes were lame, the episodes didn't have enough plot (or humor...rather, ""Family Guy Humor"") to make it worth buying. Honestly, it was like they were so stoked on being back they just phoned it tin, feeling untouchable. The episodes were completely sub par. I'm just letting people know. I'm not buying them, and if you do, I think you'll see why.Just for reference, ""The Simpsons"" this year has sunk to it's lowest and it's really time to go. I understand why ""Seinfeld"" and others chose to go out on top. ""The Simpsons"" is just pathetic with recycled jokes or jokes that need reach too far to be funny. I'm just saying this because if you agree, you'll agree with my review...I'm sure."
3,Good but not as good as before,I was eagerly looking forward to this and having watched it i can say i am a bit dissapointed.Dont get me wrong its still funny and there is some classic scenes.But it suffers from two major problems in my opinion1.Far to many cut away/flashback gags if you dont know what i mean think of it like this peter mentions something he did before then it cuts to what he did.Of course if it was funny that does not matter but many link with my other problem2.It seems to me they have extended many gags or scenes to the point where they no longer become funny (the vomiting scene is one).It similar to what simpsons did in some early episodes because they were not long enough.Like in the episode where side show bob steps on a rake.But here it seems to have been done for even longer then thatOverall i still like this series but can easily say its not as good as previous series.
1,It took them 3 years to come up....with this?,"Wow, Family Guys comback could not have been more dissapointing. There are maybe 3 or 4 good episodes in this entire set. I think the writers stopped caring about writing actual stories and instead opted for ""Hey lois this is better then the time I...."" moments. The episodes have little to no story and almost no cohesion. Many of the gags are not even jokes they are ""hey I know what thats from"" gags."
5,Are there anymore sacred cows left?,I hope so because this animation is hilarious. This is got to be the funniest animated series on TV.
4,Very funny - with a caveat,"As in my reviews of the previous volumes of FG, Family Guy is Family Guy - it can be side-splitting funny at times and offensive at other times. Take it or leave it.I would certainly agree with other reviews - though still great TV, it does feel like it has lost a little bit of its freshness. There are times where jokes just go on too long (Peter fighting the chicken, the stupid AIDS song) or references are a little too obscure. Still, for anyone who's a fan of the show, it would make a great gift."
4,Family Guy Kicks Ass But...,"This DVD set is lacking in almost every aspect ...first there is the obvious ITS NOT THE WHOLE SEASON!!! there is 24 episodes in the season and only 13 are on this DVD set?? wth is that?? second the episodes on this DVD set are great but with the amount of space not taken up from the lack of other episodes i would have liked to see a little bit more special features. I gave it 4 stars because family guy is probably one of the best comedic cartoons on TV right now but other than that, FOX really screwed up on this box set."
3,Weirdly Different,"The retooling of the characters (suddenly Stewie's a confirmed heterosexual who's no longer concerned about world domination or killing Lois, Stewie and Brian are no longer at one another's throats, and Brian's got issues about Black people, which really makes no sense in light of the fact that Peter and the kids are part Black) was a little bit unsettling. It wasn't character development as much as it was smacking new personalities onto old characters (although I have to admit that I like the new Stewie a lot more). There were some genuinely hilarious segments, but it seems that the writers depended a little too heavily on references to the 80s -- which are getting increasingly obscure -- and previous episodes for filler. As an aside, I'm relieved that they got rid of Loretta, not because I didn't like the character, but because Alex Borstein's voicing of her was pretty much audio blackface and the ""Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire"" episode was particularly excruciating."
2,what the devil!,beleive me i love family guy i think its hilarious but what annoys me is that they are selling seasons by the half! look at it this way a show like the simpsons can cost any where between $20 msrp to $50 msrp depending on the season so lets say the average simpsons season costs $35 when i buy the simpsons which is in my mind equally as good as family guy i get 25 episodes for $35 but when i buy family guy im getting 13 episodes for $40 it just doesnt make sence to me they are just trying to rip us off honestley it is not fair at all id rather by the simpsons
4,family guy vol. 3,"goog but not as good as the last two volumes. The laughter is less subtle and definitly less intelligent. You won't need much knowledge of movies history culture etc... This time the laughter is more pounded into your brain. Family guy has lost in my view a very fundemental essence which made it the revolutionary cartoon that it was before. Maybe like a lot of other artists, the creator has lost his hunger now that he is full. Still a must see for all fans of the show, but a true fan will definitly understand what i am talking about. Don't put your hopes up to high. to some it up, the show is more trashy and less intellectual but still fun."
3,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this new DVD series, as I really enjoyed the heck out of the first two, but it's unfortunately left me quite disappointed. I suppose the intervening years since the cancellation were too much to recover from. This new series seems as though the new staff of writers didn't even bother watching the first series. The plots are pointless, the timing of most of the material is terrible and falls flat more times than not. Stewie, who is undoubtably the focal point of the show, is used relatively rarely in this round of episodes to their detriment. The usual movie spoofs seem entirely mechanical and devoid of humor, more used as filler than as amusing punchlines.To be sure, there are a few belly laughs available, but amazingly few for a full season of episodes. Hopefully the show can return to form for the next season, but if it winds up anything like this season perhaps Fox was right to cancel it."
5,What a comeback!!!,"the 4th season is so funny it contains somme of the best episodes even if it only has 13 episodes.family guy got back on t.v because of its dvd if you bought the other sets buy this one two it got better special features than the two other sets .highligts;model misbehavior,the cleveland-lorreta quagmire,fast times at buddy clancy hight,north by north quahog wich is about the funniest.lowlights;are you kidding me?the only thing is there is only 13 episodes.it contains not appropriate contents for some viewers such as the season oppener.overal great box set ;3 cds ,13 episodes good bonuses everithings pretty much rocks!finaly a great comeback season from family guy i hopes it continues!"
2,"Not a great season, not a great box set...","Vol. 3 marks a new low for Family Guy: A season that started out strong but ended very ""OH my god, I was so shocked by that hahahahaha"". It seems to be riding on it's laurels, so to speak, and it's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don't like it, and I think it's been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I'd like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD's have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven. We only get thirteen episodes of crap, and maybe we should be grateful, but all in all, whatever.Raoul Duke."
1,I Want My Money Back!,We should be able to sue a company that takes your money and forces you to watch their previews against your will. Dammit! This is so dishonest. Shame on them!
5,The Funniest Volume YET!!!!!!,I can't even begin to describe how funny Vol 3 of The Family Guy is. With all the time off from not airing they didn't lose any edge at all. They came back with hilarious episodes week after week without missing a beat. I guarantee you'll laugh until you can't breath. I know I did on multiple episodes. You won't be disappointed you bought it.
5,Family Guy Purchase,It came in great condition. THe only problem I had was that I paid Overnight shipping and it didnt come in until a couple days layter. That is the only thing I didnt like. But when I talked with customer service they were very helpful.
4,Will everybody just stop this nonsense,"Ok........I agree that the show hasn't been as good as when it first came out. I have read most of these other reviews and some of you people sicken me as FG fans. I know it sucks that they have had to tame the show down a lot but at least it is back on the air. Personally, I wasn't really into season 1, but I loved season 2. So now they are back on, the next season might be great. So far, I think the episodes have been getting better. So, if all you guys want to give up because they had a couple lame shows, that is fine, but can anybody tell me any show that didn't have one single lame show? Because I can't. So give up, but FG rocks and the DVD rocks."
2,YOU GUYS TAKE REFUNDS?,"WOW...FIRST OFF, I AM A HARDCORE FG FAN...BUT VOL 3 FALLS SO SHORT OF BEING A GOOD BUY, THAT ITS SCARY...THE SET CONTAINS 13 FREAKIN EPISODES!!! SELLS AT REGULAR PRICE, AND AS FAR AS TAKING QUALITY INSTEAD OF QUANTITY, NOT EVEN! I COULD UNDERSTAND IF THE 13 EPISODES WERE EXCELLENT, BUT MOST OF THEM ARE PREDICTABLE, BORING, AND FORCE-FED TO YOU...IT JUST SUX THAT THE FG TEAM WOULD SCREW THEIR LOYAL FANS IN SUCH A WAY...BY THE WAY, WHENS VOLUME 4 COMING OUT? I GOTTA START SAVING"
2,TRASH,"i THINK THIS IS A POOR EXCUSE FOR ANYONE TO ALLOW TRASH LIKE THIS TO BE RECORDED. IT HAS NO PLACE IN MY INVENTORY. OTHER THAN THAT, DELIVERY OF THE ORDER WAS QIUET EFFICIANT."
2,Show's return was a letdown,"I was one of the millions who signed petitions begging FOX to bring this show back. Now, I'd sign one asking them to cancel it again. Family Guy season's 1-3 will always be known as the ""real"" Family Guy to me. With few exceptions, everything since then has been crap. Some episodes, in fact, are just horrible. This used to be a smart show that adults were proud to say they watched. Now, it's just a childish cartoon. Seth, put this show to rest...please!"
4,Still good after all these years,"The new season isn't as good as the old ones, but it is still the very funny and the best thing on TV."
2,Part 1 is rehash of season 1.,"WARNING: This part 1 is simply a rehash of Season 1, which I already have, plus a few extras. Did Fox re-air most Season 1 episodes in Season 4? I don't know.If you want to see Season 1, great. If you thought this Part 1 was different from Season 1, don't buy this set. Part 2 of Season 4 appears to be all new episodes."
1,A very bad season.,Season 4 started with a few great episodes in the beginning but fell way to short going towards the end. There are so many bad episodes such as:Brian the BachelorPeter's Got Woods ( I just have to poit out worst episode of the year on any show)Perfect CastawayJungle Love
3,"like the show, but...","...dont think its necessary to have the pre and post content in every feature, can only listen to the theme so many times before I wear out the ff button."
5,It rocks,"Like many people, I thought paying $30 for this set was a joke. I bought it fairly cheap, and I couldnt be happier. The speical features still lack, but the menus are really cool. Its confusing though. Many epsiodes I was glad to own on dvd, but I thought they were on season five. I cant figure out where season five began and season four ended. Is this just the first part of season 4 and they are making part two right now? It might seemed rushed, but to fans, its really good. I thought they lost an edge but recently watched it more, and it really hasnt lost any touch whatsoever."
1,Has annoying previews that can't be skipped over,"I hope the first few seasons of Family Guy get remastered and uncensored and repackaged to include every episode that goes with each season instead of selling them separate (the story of stewie griffin for example.) As for the biggest problem with this collection, is the first disc, Disc One, Volume Three, has previews that can't be skipped over."
5,Freaking Awesome,"There are some seriously classic episodes in this season. I live in a dorm and this dvd set get passed around the floor like currency, or something else that gets exchanged equally as much. If you can handle a resonable level of fart jokes then this dvd set is for you. Oh man, there's this one bit where everyone is vomiting all over, and I know you're all thinking ""sorry, vomit is gross not funny"", needless to say, your wrong. I can't make it through the scene without crying. Tears streaming down my face, it's that good."
3,Family Guy,"While Family Guy does occassionally make me laugh so hard my sides hurt, the episodes never really have any plot. The writers always use flashbacks to events that never occurred and sometimes thess flashbacks are waaaaaaay too long (like when Stewie went cross-country to slap will ferrell) and not funny. And the show bites way, way too much off the simpsons. It's probbaly better to tape the episodes you like off TV than buy a whole box-set."
1,Complete garbage,"The people who made these new episodes and these DVD's are sipmly trying to make money now, plain and simple. The first three seasons where done very well and are quite funny. There were also seven episodes on each disk. Now, with season four, we see only 4 episodes on each disk, very poor and unfunny episodes, and we still had to pay an arm and a leg for it and it's only the first half of the season that was released. I'll never buy another Family Guy DVD as long as I live."
1,Horribly Dissapointing,I expected something like the first 3 seasons of family guy. What I got was a 3 dvd set of the worst television I've ever seen. Don't buy this. Even and especially if you liked the old family guys. On the entire first DVD I laughed once. ONCE. I wont be watching the other two.
2,Family Guy is Back,"And.. not as funny as it used to be.It has its moments, such as the 'take on me' parody, but lately the series hasnt really had any storylines. It's all been just random stuff. Peter says or does something stupid, then abruptly cuts away to something from the 80's like the Snorks or Thundercats, repeat.I liked seasons 1-3 better, becuase while they did have what i mentioned above, they also had a STORYLINE in each episode. this season it's just random crazy stuff happening every two seconds, with no story whatsoever."
5,Family Guy rules,"One of the funniest shows of all time. I love the way this show always manages to go just a little bit farther than they probably should with their jokes. Some may be offended, but if your skin is thick enough, this show is hilarious."
4,"It's Back, and It's Beautiful.","It's the show that did the impossible. Defiying all the odds, ""Family Guy"" came out of cancellation! Fans rejoice...The second coming has arrived in the form of what saved it: DVD! Now I can watch ""Blind Ambition,"" ""Brian the Batchleor,"" and ""Perfect Castaway"" over and over again. There has been only one change that only the Commentary explains: Brian has his own car. Other than that, Family Guy picks up where it left off. All the old chacters are back (except the nudists, Kevin, Cleveland Jr, and, of course, Mr. Weed ), and the Greased-Up Deaf Guy shows up a bit. I wish they could have waited to release volume 3, because there aren't many more episodes left in season 4, and I can't wait for volume 4 to see ""PTV,"" ""The Courtship of Stewie's Father,"" and ""The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz."" Plus ""Brian Swings and Sings,"" and ""Patriot Games"" were not very good episodes. But other than that, Family Guy Volume 3 is a great buy."
2,Buy Vol. 1 & 2 first,"When I first heard the news of the fourth season of Family Guy i was over joyed. I saw the first few episodes and they held true to the first three seasons, but just seemed to be missing something. After the first three episodes, the humor was lacking.So if you plan on getting this, and just began watching family guy this season, then i recommend you put off buying vol. 3 and buy Vol. 1&2 to put your money to better use.Lets all hope season five will not follow the same downhill run as season 4 did"
3,Wait for Season 5,"I agree with many reviewers that season 4 was something of a letdown. The jokes aren't coherent and all the characters are just weird. I liked Family guy because their jokes were a mix of clever, shocking, silly and satire. Season 4 was mostly just shocking and silly. However, I will defend my favorite series beause the first few episodes of season 5 that have come out were noticeably better then season 4. This leads me to believe that Seth McFarlane was overworked when they did season 4. He had to pump out the episodes really quickly to get them on the air in time, he was working on American Dad and the movie at the same time. Now that he has a little more time, and the movie is done we should see a return to the Family Guy we know and love. Hopefully American Dad gets cancelled too because it's nowhere near as good as Family Guy."
3,"It's back, but...","First off, I must say how thrilled i am that family guy is back. It has long been my favorite, and these new episodes are nice to see. However, it seems that at least in this season, the creators had to fall back on a number of laugh strategys that aren't really funny. For example, the repeater: where a charecter repeats himself over and over and over. or the progressor: ex, where Stewie reiterates his point about Brian's novel for 30 seconds. These things are not that funny!!! Also, Stewie is no longer an evil baby genius bent on world domination or matricide. There was a not a single attempt on Lois' life during a single episode. BRING BACK THE OLD STEWIE. I can't be too hard on this show, as i trully do love it, but it seems that the writers need some new joke ideas, and need to return to the old stewie charecter."
1,PVC Material / Not Healthy,"I was hoping it would not be made of potentially harmful material. Upon closer inspection of the packaging that the Sunshower comes in, it gives the disclaimer that the item is made of materials that have been found by the State of California to cause cancer.So, hey, it's really your choice. I just returned mine in the mail as soon as I read that. But I don't blame Stearns. All the portable showers are of the same PVC, no matter the brand.I think Kleen Kanteen needs to come up with a ""Kleen Shower,"" I'd buy it!"
5,Rockin' AWESOME.,"My dad bought us this shower several years ago for us to clean up after a beach trip - we fill it up & had plenty of water to shower off 2 kids, shampoo & all - AND rinse ourselves off before getting in the car. WE LOVED IT SO MUCH we used it 'till it died. (Mind you, we killed it - it got TONS of use for over 3 years)SO - I bought another one just recently before our last camping trip... I can't say enough good things about this shower. :) If only it came with one of those Monster, Inc. type pop-up privacy curtains.... hmmmm...."
3,SunShower,"It really heats the water, and keep it so for some time, but just after the first use the silver sheet alread peeled off."
2,Same old,I haven't had any luck with solar showers. They all seem to last for a couple of weeks and then start leaking. This one is no exception. You might as well buy two cheaper showers instead of one of these.
5,Fresh and fun CD,"I bought this CD on a whim. Usually when I do this, I am very disappointed. Not this time!! Danielle's music has rhythm and pizzazz and she has a sure, sweet, fluid voice which is confident and mature. After being won over by the music, I read the lyrics and was even more delighted. My family will have to listen to me singing these songs for a long while. If you are in the U.S., it's worth the extra time (took about a month for me to receive it)and money. When's her next CD due???"
5,Definitely worth buying!,"I bought this album, along with TOFOG's OWOS, just to hear what Danielle sounds like. I'm glad I did! The music is different but in a good way - very creative - the songs stay in my head well after I've stopped listening to the CD. I love how she whispers or talks in some of the songs with her beautiful voice. This is a CD that I haven't stopped playing since I got it in the mail. Go Danielle! Can't wait to hear your next CD!"
4,Off to a Great Start,"Ms. Spencer is a musician/actress from Sydney, Australia. Her first CD shows off her beautiful voice, lyrics and keyboard musicianship. This one includes extra tracks. Her songs are atmospheric and ethereal. Perhaps all the electronics and voiceovers detract from the delicate, bell-like quality of her voice. Still, it is a haunting and mesmerizing first effort. She is currently working on her next CD and I am looking forward to that."
1,Discontinued,I have tried to order this item 2x and called the distributer who told me it was discontinued. It should be taken off the web site.
5,The Birds,Always watched this movie when it was on tv. Now I can watch it anytime I want. Fast shipment and excellent condition when it arrived.
1,DVD did not play,The DVD did not play in my blue ray DVD player or my laptop DVD player. It was like it was for a different country
3,When Birds Attack,"Movie Title: The BirdsDirector: Alfred HitchcockScreenwriter: Evan TalorThe movie ""The Birds"" Took place in San Fransisco, California and in Bodega Bay, California. In the begining Melanie Daniels meets Mitch Brenner in a pet store wich leads Ms. Daniels to take love birds to Mitch. That is were the bird congregate and were mostly all of the attacks happen. The towns people try to blame Ms. Daniels for all the attacks on the town. The brenners and Ms. Daniels go to the Brenners house and board it up while most people are trying to shrug off all the attacks and say that they were just flukes. The birds attack the house and try to get in but Mr. brenner fights them off the bes he can. The end of the movie is what dissapointed me the most. I recomend you watch this movie to get your own opinion.MchsNHG"
2,IT WAS ALRIGHT,"I thought of the movie birds is not that interesting because the special effects werent that great. the acting was good and i guess it was the frist time for Tippi hedren (Melanie) acting and she did a good job. The birds sound so fake but their time it was good for them. When it ended that was the worst part of the movie because it tell you what happen next. It didnt say what happen to Melanie. But the parts they were attacking thety were alright, but if it was at this time it would be better. The actors were a good cast the best actor was melanie but you didnt get to know her. Maybe if they did better with the birds it would have got a better rate for me. The thing with the movie was all about the birds but they neededto work on them."
3,Wow!,I viewed this video in my Film Appreciation class of 2004 and it was a video I do not recommend. It had no music what-so-ever and the noises were just not natural. The actors were awesome but the acting was poor (Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor). It had many things in it that I did not view as a good thing that you would put in a movie. Bad acting and no music would make a person watching it go crazy. I gave it three stars do to the fact that it had no music and bad acting.
3,weak ending,"I entirely agree with Rachel of San Jose. I speak as a Hitchcock fan, but there is no doubt that the ending to the Birds is a serious flaw in the movie. Hitchcock experts (such as Donald Spoto) have always seemed to gloss over the weak ending. It totally lacks credibility in the context of what has gone before. Compare it, for example, to the much more chilling (and pessimistic) end to Du Maurier's short story masterpiece (upon which the movie was based). A very good movie certainly, but hardly a great one, I think."
3,BODEGA BAY,"I recently viewed this movie for about the third time, and I was amazed at just how great some of the special effects were considering it was filmed in 1963. Suzanne Pleshette as Annie and Ethel Griffies as the wise old hag near the end give the best performances. Jessica Tandy was a usually terrific performer, but some of her scenes here are simply laughable and the cool Tippi acts like a Dresden doll. The film is an original to be sure & certainly has redeeming qualities in the special effects department; I just think the lead performances are just a tad wooden."
3,"All around, I feel it's a good movie.","The movie ""The Birds"", by Alfred Hitchcock is good for being made in the sixties. The movie could be made a little better in some areas. When Melanie is crossing the bay, and the camera shows her,the background isn't going with her strokes and it seams unrealistic. All around, I feel it's a good movie. The special effects in the movie could have been improved. There should have been music parts where the birds attacked, it would have made it more interesting. As I said before the background in many places did not keep up with the characters. However, when Hitchcock got the birds to attack, the special effects rate"
3,out of region,unfortunately i made a mistake and ordered a movie that does not work in my dvd player. i will have to order another one
3,the brids,hi .this is gary cullen and iam happy to say the birds landed okay. this movie takes me back a while .these movies are hard to beat. i like the older movies and will be after more over the coming months .iam happy with the service and will buy more from amazon .thank you gary cullen. i also ordered shocking asia at the same time and still have not received the discs . iam wondering where they have gone . thank you gary cullen.
4,Alfred Hitchcock as only he could...,"I ordered this movie for a film class that I was teaching. I wanted to show horror, classic horror not the trash that shows up so often today.I was not disappointed in the movie. It had my 13 year olds at the edge of thier seats by the end of the movie. Just goes to show you that Hitchcock can even appeal to the modern, over-exposed students of today.The beginning is longer than expected, however, when the action of the story starts, it snowballs. The suspense that Hitchcock creates is the best part of the movie with my students trying to guess what is going to happen next and alternatives not matching what is given to them.I would definitely recommend this movie as an alternative to the messes that pass for horror and suspense nowadays."
4,Bird's Eye View,"This little thriller by Hitchcock still holds up pretty well even after circa 50 years. Good script, direction, and camera work. Decent acting. No...it isn't Gone With the Wind, Forrest Gump, or Jaws. If you approach this work with expectations like that, you will be disappointed.If you can accept the seeming improbability of out-of-the-blue, coordinated attacks by huge mixed masses of murderous avian kamikazes, you will probably enjoy this old video.If you can't-or, if sci-fi/fantasy just isn't your thing, you probably won't. I usually like to give any speculative fiction writer, novelist, or scriptwriter at least one big improbability per story. One disbelief-suspending ""what-if?"" scenario. As long as it isn't too off-the-wall, I'll go along. In this case I believe the concession was worth the effort."
3,Missing parts...,"I love this movie. The odd thing is that a part I remember seeing in the theaters is not there. When the children leave the schoolhouse there is a very tense part where they walk quietly by the birds, who become more and more menacing, and then attack. It is one of the best scenes in the movie. Strangely enough, it skips that entire part and just starts with the kids running. If I am misremembering, please let me know, but I am pretty sure this is not the way this scene originally played out."
2,Terribly overrated...,"In my opinion this movie is one of Hitch's worst. The movie has an incredibly pointless plot which kept me completely disinterested. Also, the acting is fairly low par at times, especially from Tippi Hedren. But, the movie isn't a complete loss. The story could be probed a little deeper, as could any movie. However, I wouldn't suggest this movie to most people. If your going to watch a Hitchcock movie, check out something like Vertigo, Rebecca, or The Man Who Knew Too Much. Those are true classics."
3,Whats Wrong With the Birds?,"""The Birds"" was an alright movie, but it wasn't great. I did not think it was scary. During the middle of the movie it was pretty good. However I did not like it when Annie died. That part just didn't go well with the whole movie.The ending of this particular movie was horrible. ""The Birds"" could have ended in a lot a different ways than eveyone leaving the town. It would have been a lot more better if the movie would have told us what was wrong with the birds and where all of the people in Bodega Bay went.Tippi Hedren did an excellent job at acting for her first film. It looked like she has been acting for her whole life. She fit into her character perfect."
1,DVD review,The video I received in the mail does not play on DVD players in the US. This was not specified when I bought it. I have a DVD I cannot use.
1,Very scary!!,"I just saw the movie ""The Birds"" a couple weeks ago and it scared me so bad! Ive read part of the novel but the movie was far more scarier! I had to read the book and watch the movie for school (I am a freshman in high school)and do an essay on it. But it was ok. I could have seen better acting cause Melanie acted to perfect and personally I thought she was a terrible actress!"
1,"What is that, I haven't a Clue to what that is?","I hate this Movie, because where I'm concerned, this is Extreamly to Spokey / Scarry to be watching. But if your the type of person who Craves / Loves Scarry Films, then and only then is this Movie for you. If your like me where you Don't like them, then all I can say is DON'T watch it, it could give you Nightmares if your NOT Carefull!"
4,Brutal Brimming Birds Attack,"When the small town of Bodega Bay is abruptly attacked by the swarming of thousands of birds, Tippi Hendren as Melanie Daniels and Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner must act fast. In this 1963 Hitchcock live action film the drama and horror of an unruly attack breaks loose. I really enjoyed and recommend watching this film and reading the story of ""The Birds"". There are many differences from the movie and the written story, but one thing that they definitely have in common are their suspenseful endings which, I guess you will just have to watch for yourself and/or read for yourself to experience the thrill of this movie and story.MCHS:JMC"
3,Not the best by Alfred Hitchcock,"This film was an alright film. For the timeperiod when the movie was made, I think that the special effects were great. The fake birds might look corny in todays terms, but back then I am sure they looked real and scary.The birds don't actually start attacking the people until about the half of the movie, but when they finally started attacking the people it was pretty fun. I think that the worst part of the film was the ending. All of the people just left the town, it never told what happened to the town, or any of the people who left the town.The actors and actresses and did a nice job in the film. Tippi Hedren, who played as Melanie Daniels, did an excelent job, especially since it was her first movie she had ever acted in. I would recomend this movie to people, just don't be excited about the ending."
4,The Birds,"The Birds suspense movie well i would say it was at the time it was. I thought that i was directed perfectly for its time. I know now any teenager would look at this movie and be like what this this but i have seen it and i enjoyed it. You thave to thgink that to the time and it was a great movie at the time. In its time it scared people out of their mind but now you wathc it its like you are watching a comedy. The players in the movie were great they fit the parts perfectly, Melanie Daniels was played by tippi hedren a rich girl that falls for a man Mitch Brenner who was played by Rod Taylor, she fallows him to a small town to bring him a couple of birds he ordered. She ends up saying and things get bad in this ocean front town."
2,I felt this movie stopped right in the middle.,"This movie was not my kind of movie. I like horror films, but this movie didn't seem like a hrror film. It was more of a drama. I'm sure people from 1963 liked it. The special effects of the movie were pretty cool, like how the birds acted so crazly and how all different kinds of birds were surrounding the characters. I wondered how that was done. One thing that was really missing from the movie was music. In a horror film there has to be music or the movie is less interesting and less suspenseful. The ending of the movie upset me because Hitchcock didn't tell why the birds acted so crazly or what they were after. I like endings where there is a conclusion. Everything is explained such as who did what and why. The movie needed some more action, it was too dull."
2,Am I the only one annoyed by the ending?,"I've read some of the other reviews on here, and from what I've seen NO ONE has complained about the horrible ending. Why? Because there is no ending!! Hitchcock usually manages to find a way to explain everything in his movies. In Psycho the Psychiatrist told the whole story; in Vertigo it was all revealed in the end and in Rear Window the crime is solved. But The Birds' unfinished ending was HORRIBLE. If you're a person who needs closure (like me) this is not the movie for you.Some who have NOT seen the movie, may be bothered by my revealing the movie's lack of ending. But I promise that I'm giving NOTHING away. Even if I sat here and told you the whole ending it detail, you wouldn't believe me and would have to check it out for yourself. So don't worry. I am spoiling nothing. (Because there is nothing to spoil!!)"
3,"Good, but a little to graphic.","The movie is so outdated that it wasn't scary, but some of the scenes were kind of graphic. It was VERY slow too."
3,Watch Out For Those Birds,"The movie ""The Birds"" Took place in San Fransisco, California and in Bodega Bay, California. In the begining Melanie Daniels meets Mitch Brenner in a pet store wich leads Ms. Daniels to take love birds to Mitch. That is were the bird congregate and were mostly all of the attacks happen. The towns people try to blame Ms. Daniels for all the attacks on the town. The Brenners and Ms. Daniels go to the Brenners house and board it up while most people are trying to shrug off all the attacks and say that they were just flukes. The birds attack the house and try to get in but Mr. Brenner fights them off the best he can. The birds is one of Alfred Hitchcocks best movies in fact it is his first film for Universal Pictures. Overall the movie was pretty good for being a classic it is not my favorite classical movie but it still ranks up there towards the top.MCHS CNY"
3,One timer,It was better the first time I saw it I get a little nervous when is see birds flock. The effects are nowhere to what they would be in today's world. Bit they did a great time for the time is was made.
5,Creepy as ever,A seriously creepy film. Getting the kids away is one of the all-time suspense sequences.My only cavil is the packaging. There isn't any. You get a box and a disc and that is it. A card with even minimal info on the film would be nice.
1,ugh,"Despite paying extra for 1-2 day shipping, this DVD still took 3 days before my order was shipped. Once I finally received it, I discovered that this is the UK edition of the DVD...which doesn't play on my computer. I had to go to B&N to buy an expensive copy because I'm using this movie for a final project for school."
3,DIDNT LIKE THE BIRDS,"The birds was an interesting movie,but it could have been way better. Especially the graphics. For how old it was it really was a good movie. I think Alfred Hitchcock did a great job.I think that the birds were aggressive because they were eating the chickens bad food. I rate this a three star because of course its an old movie and I dont like old movies but suprisingly Im writing a review.I hated the end because they never found out why the birds were attacking and it just ended with them leaving.It didnt make sense.Its retarded because I could have taken the birds on with one hand. Birds well some birds are retarded."
3,so so,"[WARNING: movies spoilers ahead] Recently I watched Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, and The Birds. Out of these four, I only liked Vertigo... the other was not much of anything new, probably due to so many other movies imitating it... but god... even if none did that, can Rear Window be so highly acclaimed as it is? It feels only like a low budget Hong Kong black and white movie made in two weeks. The plot sucked. For The Birds, I guess there is some hidden meaning to the ending, but can it be made more clear... right now it feels like a horror movie with no ending. I can accept other movie having no ending, such as Yi Yi or Rebels in the Neon Light... but a horror movie or action movie just ending abruptly?Even some re-run of Hitchcock on the TV that is 30 minutes long have more twist and surprise and ending better than The Birds, Psycho, and Rear Window."
3,It was scarrrrrryyyyyy!!!!!,"I thought this movie was decent but it took too long to get to the good part.The first bird attack scene was okay,but it was the best when the birds attacked the entire town.I also thought the part when the birds attacked the kids in the school.I give this movie about 3 stars."
4,Was there ever a scarier movie?,"I saw this movie again a few years ago and found that I could not view the scenes of the birds attacking the house or the telephone booth. And the scene with the birds occupying just about every available space near the school yard once again gave me the heebie-jeebies!I did not give it 5 stars simply because it is starting to show its age. It would be interesting to discover what someone thought who was seeing it for the first time (an older person, since kids today have been inundated with quick cuts and plenty of action. This film is not about action.)"
2,Apparently. this movie is big in Korea..that sub-title comes up all the time and you have to go to set-up to stop it.,The Birds (Collector's Edition)The movie is a classic Hitchcock--only problem with DVD is that Korean subtitles always show unless you go into set up to change to none
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I have to say that I was distinctly unimpressed with this film. Having read the book, I noticed that the tension and strangeness inherent in the situation did not come across strongly due to sleepy editing and the mere fact that the film dragged on for far too long. Yes, the acting is decent, as is the script, but it could have been so much better. It needed to be snappier, more abrupt, perhaps a little less subtle; haunting the viewer in a different way. Admittedly, it must have been hard to make, but I've seen better Hitchcock films. Read the book."
4,"A chilling, surprising and heart-stopping horror classic.","What is there not to be said of Hitchcock's BIRDS? The Master's subtlety is explored as never before, the silent repulsions, innovatively terrifying angles, and the revolutionary oscar-nominated special effects (By Ub Iwerks) grip the viewer's attention mercilessly, not releasing until the film's close. Tippi Hedren's raw, but vulnerable Melanie Daniels, is, at worst, an impressive commencement for an underrated actress. Though critics like Pauline Kael have described the characters as ""cardboard cutouts"" refined ones like Maltin have called it ""Not for the squeamish; A delight for those who are game."" Indeed, a malicious delight."
3,the birds,"Ithought that the movie The Birds directed by Alfred Hitchcock was a very good movie for being filmed in the 60s'. The special effectscould have had a little work in making them seem more realistic.I didnt care for the scene when Lidia Brener (Jessica Tandy)had found Deke Carter in the room with his eyes all gouged out because she ran out of the room without screaming one bit.I thought the actors fit thier roles well.The end of the film was cool because nobody won. They didnt defeat the birds, and the birds didnt kill them which is an unusual ending for a horror movie now a days.The end of the film had me glued to my seat because I"
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this dvd in good faith that I could simply put it in my dvd player and watch the movie and not have my family crowd around a pc. I went back and checked and your advertisement and it did saw region 2 disc which at that time did not mean much to me but to me it don't make sense to sell dvd's in America that won't play in an American dvd player. When people order off Amazon they look for cheapest price in order to save. Since you are not willing to pay for the return, not willing to refund the postage paid and only will refund 50% of the purchase price it's not worth the effort to return it and since I don't know anyone in Japan, Europe or South Africa I'll throw this mess in the trash where it belong."
3,The Birds,"The Birds is a good movie. I like the part at the end when the birds are attacking Tippi Hedren. It was one of the best Alfred Hithcock movies ever made.I watched this movie about 3 years ago and it literally scared me away from birds. I was so freaked out, I couldn't go near any birds for weeks.The only complaint I have (and it may seem minor to some of you) but I think it looks a little out-dated. I mean, come on, who wears their hair in the same style as Tippi Hedren now a days?All in all, a good movie."
2,Hitchcock's second to last worst film,"In fact, the only hitch film worse than it is To Catch A Thief. The so-called Master of Suspense masters mostly boredom and dullness throughout the movie. If you can get past the first 50 minutes, though, you'll be okay. The definate highlight of the film was when a man drops a match on a trail of gas. It blows up, and you are shown four stills of Tippi Hendren's terrified face. It was supposed to be serious, but it was hilarious. My brother and I watched it over and over again; it cracked us up.Eventually, the film has SOME good parts with the attacking birds; but those scenes could sometimes be disappointing. Really, I do not recommend seeing it."
2,disappointment,"The product was purchased for a gift for a family member. Unfortunately, the movie was not formatted for viewing on technologyused to play normal American movies! I do not recall any warning in the detailed review of the movie listed.RParks"
2,"blah blah blah, this film is still dull","watching this movie 20 yrs after my first viewing i was still struck with the same impression: dull. I could only remember about 20 minutes of the movie b/c that was the only 20 minutes that was interesting. the first hour can be scrapped. dull, silly dialogue that sets up little in the story later on. there is some tension with the birds, but that's the 20 minutes. as for symbolism, you can create and invent all you want, but it's not compelling. a very underwhelming movie, sorry."
2,This movie was not that great.,"My general opinion of the film, the birds as a whole is that this movie would have been a great movie if I was from that era. I felt as if the plot could of been better because it took too long to get to the point. More action was needed during the first hour. I guess the movie's special effect's were O.K. for that time. My opinion is that all of the birds sounded like a giant flock of Donald Duck's. Rod taylor's part as Mitch Brenner, would have been better if he had some better supporting actresses. Tippi Hedren (Melanie Danials) play your typical 1990's blonde in a 1960's movie. I feel as if she is just there to look pretty and be somthing to look at. Where was the ending? There was no ending. When I see a movie I expect to have an ending. The Birds just left me hanging. I feel as if this movie cannot compare with a modern day horror film. This movie is nothing compared to Friday the 13th movies. My rating of this movie is ** (two stars)"
1,worthless,"This disc wouldn't play in anything! we tried playing it in multiple devices such as dvd player blu ray ps3 xbox all said disc can not be read, very disappointed about this purchase. As long as it took to get here and to not even work."
4,Hitch's last great movie?,"Compared to other Hitchcock masterpieces, this one disappoints me the most. I find no chemistry between the leads and nothing compelling in the plot.That aside, as pure cinema you can't beat ""The Birds."" The tone, the pacing and the small details (no music!) make up for all of it's flaws.As a DVD, ""The Birds"" is a worthy companion to ""Vertigo,"" ""Psycho,"" and ""The 39 Steps."" Sure, there's no commentary, but the documentary alone provides plenty of detail for cinemaphiles. Besides, Tippi Hedren's screen tests give you more of a sense of what it's like working for Hitchcock than anything she could say in a commentary track. The only disappointment here: the extra scenes consist of storyboards and script pages that whip past you pretty quickly!"
2,corny but classic,"This film in my eyes is a classic, but really corny. The idea of birds attacking people is kind of lame. I know back in the day, it was great film, which im not saying it was bad but its one of those films that wasnt very exciting. The ending was even bad, it looks like it will be very exciting but then it leaves you hanging. Same with the birds them selves, the film doesnt even say why they were attaking. Which to me makes me mad, I like to know the reasons why things do what they do in movies(if that makes any sense).So if you want a film that will leave you hanging and kind of mad, then the Birds is right up your alley. Once again im not saying it was a bad film im just saying it makes you disapointed. Watch the film and you will see what I mean."
2,I dont feel that the movie was all that great.,"I think that Birds was interesting,although I dont rate the movie very highly compared to today's film's.I do feel that it should be seen, simply because Al is a great directer, and, along, with Psycho it is one of the first film's of its kind. As far as special effects go, they are great for the 60's,yet for today my little broth could have done better. Although the way they got the birds to stay there was cool. I feel that the characters did a good job. Ithink that Tippi Hedern,playing the part of Melanie Daniels, could have shown more drama when being attacked. The ending should have gone on longer. It left you siting there saying ""is that the end ?"" Compared to todays horror film's I would rate it poorly, due to the fact we are used to seeing blood, guts, and somthing fast paced. On a scale of 1 - 5 I rate this film 2.5,because it cant compare to today's film's."
2,Birdy boy,"The movie was not what I expected though it was ok it wasn't the best. When I found out we were going to watch a Alfred Hitchcock movie I expected it to be scary which it wasn't. Maybe it would be better if it wasn't about birds.The whole theme seemed sorta stupid. When i first saw Melony get attacked I laughed,I felt no fear at all. That is when I realized this would be almost as dumb the Wizard of Oz,which it was.I was mad when we didn't find out why Tweety attacked.So over all I hated this unorthadox retarded movie that was a waste of money. By the way the graphics ate rotten cheese. I seriously give hitchcock no props at all and if all his other movies are like this then I really dont know why he wasn;t fired.So in closing i rate it a 2 for reasons above."
3,inferior to Daphne du Maurier's short story,"This Hitchcock classic simply isn't up to the horror of the original du Maurier short story--an avian world holocaust with the imminent extinction of the human race. Hitchcock's catastrophe is apparently limited to a few miles of North California coast.Possibly this was done to produce a Hollywood more-or-less happy ending but it was a mistake. That combined with the limited acting skills of some of the actors, makes this a film easy to pass over.Ron Braithwaite author of Mexican Conquest novels, ""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God"""
3,Never one of my favorites,"This was never one of my Hitchcock favorites. I didn't find it all that scary and I disliked the ending. I like for there to be a point made or a solution or answer at the end of the movie. Maybe the whole point was that the birds suceeded in driving everyone out, so now the town was their's. There were a few insights into the people's personality issues, but he didn't seem to follow up on them enough for me. The main reason I watched it again was because I had just watched ""The Girl"" which is about what Hedren went thru during the filming of this movie, so I wanted to see the scenes again from that perspective. All in all, I much prefer Shadow of a Doubt, Marnie, Rear Window, and Dial M for Murder."
4,The Birds,"The movie was very entertaining and displayed Hichcock at his best. It may have seemed far-fetched to have birds attacking enmasse. However, individual birds have been known to attack humans during the nesting season. Besides the excellent performances by the leads, the supporting actors played their part as well. I appreciated the supporting feature covering the making of the movie. It was quite fascinating."
5,Very Good--------------The Best!,I loved this movie. You cant help but wonder what the birds are going to do next. It was very good. I LOVED every moment of it. Its very shocking to see all the birds attack at once. When the school children are attacked. The best. It's a classic in it's kind
1,Does not work in our region!Trying to return,I don't understand why I have to pay postage back when I paid postage to get something that will NOT WORK!
5,Classic movie,"The product was exactly as described, fast delivery and I'm very happy. The price was very reasonable. I recommend this seller and the movie. If you've ever been to Bodega Bay, you should have the movie in your collection."
5,HITCHCOCK MASTERPIECE,"Full of the usual Hitchcock touches and magnetic performances from the sound department, special effects and photohraphy. The cast headed by Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Ethel Griffth are brilliant, but is really outshone by the lovely and talented newcomer, TIPPI HEDREN. A Classic."
1,The Birds Alfred Hitchcock,"I purchased this DVD, sat with my visitors, made snacks only to find out I am unable to run the DVD on any of my DVD players. very disappointing, threw away the mailing return envelope never expecting that the DVD wouldn't work."
4,"Birds, Birds, Birds",Watched this for the first time when I was about 12 and I remember most of it. If you like Alfred Hitchcock movies your library is not complete without it.
2,Ink pad dry (old inventory)?,"All M&D products have been great. This is potentially a great one too but our ink pad came in very dry. I suppose we will try adding water to it but there are no instructions that came along with it. I hope it will be alright to do that. I wish M&D made refillable ink for the pads. The stamps, by the way, are very tiny too, which makes the dry ink pads even more unappealing."
1,DRY INK PADS,"We really enjoy Melissa ans Doug products, but when you get a dry ink pad with the stamps its pretty dissapointing. I will be emailoing the company to my dissatsfaction. We could not use until we went out and bought some ink pads."
3,Baby Zoo Animal Stamps,"The stamps are adorable and seem pretty durable although I haven't (nor do I intend to) put them through the ringer. Some cons are that there is no top for the set so the pieces are liable to fall out and lose themselves forever. I also unfortunately recieved the set with a dried out stamp pad which is quite dissapointing but a problem that can easily be solved. All in all cute durable stamps, worth the $5."
4,Great stamps...but get a better ink pad,"These are a great set of stamps for my 2 1/2 year old. She loves playing with them. The only minor problem, as stated in other reviews, is that the ink pad is a little on the dry side. We have still been using it, only because she does not seem to mind and it is toxic free (she loves to put the stamps on her arms and legs). I am currently looking for a better ink pad, as this one will be completely dry in no time."
1,Ink pad completely dried out,"I bought three of these sets as Christmas gifts and when my kids tried to use them, the ink in all three was completely dried out. Most barely left a stamp mark; some left nothing. I even tried to moisten them with a little water, but no luck. We usually love Melissa and Doug product, but these were a complete waste of money!"
2,"Good idea, poor implementation.","The book is well structured, and looking into the contents you can see that it concerns a wide range of really interesting topics. It is not as boring as other EJB books.But ...Do you think that 300 pages could cover topics like EJB security, transactions, messaging, XDoclet in such a depth that you can use the recipes in action?The other point is that the the book is full of very serious errors. Code examples are never tested and there are conceptual mistakes in the text. Did you find the errata at the publisher's web site? I didn't. It will be published in another book.So ...It would be the best book on EJB if the authors wrote it in 600 pages, got the sample code fragments from a running application and hired a publisher's reader."
5,"Most comfortable, fits narrow foot well","I have been wearing this slipper over a month and find it very comfy. I have a narrow foot and it does not slide off. Having a synthetic sole makes it nice to be able to step outside to get the paper, etc. and not worry about ruining the soles. The leather is very soft, like kid glove, and the only drawback is that one has to bend over to pull the back of the slipper over the heel. It does not have enough support in the back to just slide your foot into the slipper. However, at this great price, I am thinking that I just might buy a long-handled shoe horn to help facilitate putting on the slipper. (I am an older woman and dont find bending over that easy anymore!) But I cannot imagine anyone NOT finding this slipper to be most comfortable."
2,way too small,"I ordered a larger size of these slippers and still couldn't wear them. Too bad, 'cause they were a great deal."
2,Cute for a Night,It was cute for an evening - then the martini glass broke off (under normal usage). I still wear the bar bell without a problem. Three out of the four belly rings bought from Body Candy have broken. All in a very short (1-2 days) timeframe.
4,One of the best Bengali films of recent years,"Good to see this film getting a US DVD release; the film deserves a wider audience than it probably received on its opening in West Bengal. The cinematogrophy and music are strong, while Shayan Munshi in the lead role excels-- probably the biggest surprise of all, the kid can certainly act. I wasn't expecting too much from the film prior to seeing it; it had received some hype at release but was later recommended to me as an example of a new style of Bengali filmmaking and it more than delivered. India is producing some interesting independent cinema but it continues to be overshadowed by its bigger glossier Bollywood cousin. Hopefully films like this will sustain some level of commerciality for the makers and continue to be made. Recommended."
5,The Best,"We read and we read and we read, but there is not one book that can keep my children so quietly happy as this bittersweet, lovingly drawn little hybrid named beegu. It belongs on every little person's shelf."
2,disappointed,"My expectations were not met by this offering. Before finding the book on amazon I had quite a hunt to find it. Very early in the read I was first turned off by Mr. de Garis' penchant for stressing how much he simplifies things for us non-scientists. Ok, so thats kind of personal. His work is so interesting and the possibilities are astounding, but I think his expectation that a) cosmists and terrans will likely eradicate each other and b) that super intelligent machines will probably eradicate humans poorly explained. Anyway, all in all, if the reader has never foraged into this area its worth it for the exposure."
2,Not as Expected,"I have seen Reuben Dobbs play on youtube video, so I had high hopes for this DVD. Sadly, it did not live up to expectations. From my perspective, the material is dull, and presented in an uninspiring manner. A better choice for instruction is MIchael Messer,""Introduction to Blues Slide Guitar""."
4,am amazing life,"Mary Rippon was an amazing woman who had the courage and insight to live her life fully and with responsibility. While today's young woman could laugh at the restrictions placed on a woman of Mary's era, social restrictions of the time were rigid and enforced. I was impressed with her sense of responsibilty to her community, her family and her own personal life."
4,Answers Manifest Dilemma,I became sensitized to the weak answers and shallow government policies that poorly assist women who have been abused. I am a school teacher and have no tolerance for any type of intellectual or physical disrespect of my female students. I make students aware when they are putting themselves down and provide positive alternatives for them to get respect and popularityReverend Fortune illustrates the subtle ways in which women are relegated to being second class citizens. She pinpoints female issues that as a man I might never have become aware of.
5,Great Microsoft Office Reference,"These have been a hit in the office, everyone has gone to these a few times for reference, from our most experienced users to our new hires."
3,girly,"I took a chance on this since it was $2.99, there was no picture... I ended up with a pepto pink baby shoe. And I have a boy. Oh well. For $2.99, I guess it doesn't matter. Also, it is only one piece, not two. I am not sure if it was supposed to have a sock or something with it. It is really shiny, bright pink, and glittery though!"
4,Nail biter....,"""Marathon Man"" (1976) was directed by John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy). This film was adapted from a novel by William Goldman. Dustin Hoffman is the marathon man (Thomas ""Babe"" Levy) who finds himself immersed in the nefarious crime world given his brother's (Roy Scheider) covert operations as a secret government agent. Laurence Olivier (Dr. Christian Szell) portrays the brother of a Nazi war criminal who tries to retrieve a valuable diamond collection that is locked away in a bank without attracting attention to himself. This nail-biting thriller looks good on dvd and comes with a couple of special features, including about twenty minutes of filming footage, and an excellent half hour featurette of the ""Making of the Marathon Man"", which includes discussions with Dustin Hoffman and the director."
3,Ehhh.,"After reading Goldman's novel of the same name and being surprised by some of the twists and turns , I was eager to see how the book was converted to film. To learn how Scylla the spy, Levy the student, Janey the Provider, and Szell the Nazi were handled. I was disappointed.Don't get me wrong - the movie is a fine thriller. It just doesn't match up to what I'd been expecting. In the novel, Janey's identity is not revealed until halfway through the book, at which point you're shocked to learn the true nature of Scylla's relationship with him. This is a startling conclusion that is totally glossed over in the film. Also, while Elsa is transparently in cahoots with the bad guys even in the book, here it's made even more obvious and the viewer's small doubts of, ""Is she good or bad?"" are removed.The movie is good. You should see it. But read the book afterward."
1,Marathon Man Mockery,"If you're a fan of this film - don't buy this DVD (the Paramount ""Widescreen collection"" 120mins as sold in the UK). It has been clumsily edited to the point that key sequences no longer make sense. The renowned drilling scene, for instance IS NOT IN THIS DVD despite the fact that it appears in on the back cover and the inlay. Check imdb - the film is supposed to be 125 minutes long - not 119. A disappointing experience for me after much anticipation, and a sad end for what in its true form is an outstanding piece of film."
1,Don't buy this product if you live in the United States,"All purchasers should be aware that Region 2 means that this DVD will not play on standard equipment in the United States.The item was shipped with basically no packing protection, which resulted in damage to the DVD box. Also, no product return form was included in the order.Marathon Man [Region 2]"
3,Promising,"Promising, but a little stupidity creeps in. For one thing, we keep seeing the same three bad guys over and over again until their faces get boring. A skilled director of thrillers (which Schlesinger is not) would have known to avoid that.But Lawrence Olivier is so memorable that the movie is worth watching for his performance.The dental scene, of course, is legendary."
1,Region 2 Marathon Man,I can't view this movie on my dvd player! Didn't understand Region 2. Hate that I can't see it! bummer.
1,so what,"every body says this movie is ""great"",its dumb,it goes from scene to scene,and that about it,as for the torture scenes,they are like barely a minute long altogther(there are two torture scenes)they dont show anything,i was bored at the end of the movie."
4,Would Nearly Fit on One CD,"Both CDs are good, but short. You get skimped a bit as far as a double album goes. Some terrific tracks. I filled out my collection for this genre with these because you get mostly songs that are not these performers' bread and butter- that is, not their signature song. Which makes this an ideal piece to add to a collection, though perhaps not the best choice as a stand-alone in the genre. A lot of humorous songs featured on this one, and the highlight is ""Why Don't You do Right?"" by Lil Green, which should be in any music lover's collection. One of my favorite songs and definitely her signature tune."
1,VERY disappointing- service and customer care are inept,"I bought this product last January and found it easy to use but the scroll-pad failed soon after purchase. I returned it at my own expense, it was repaired and worked for a few weeks, then failed again. I returned it again, the second time it came back it fell apart because the tech hadn't screwed down the cover. I returned it again and the last time it failed the first day I used it. I spent several hours on hold over a bunch of calls to their support and executive customer care dep'ts, have been promised that the problem would be resolved and am still waiting for that to happen. Maybe I got a lemon, but my experience with Samsung's support dep't has been so obnoxious that I wouldn't buy another one of their products or recommend them to anyone.I say this after being very happy with other products."
2,It is not as good as it looks,"Pro: It has a bigger LCD to play photos. It is slim, and well constructed, and looks great.Cons:1) For $240 unit, the quality of sound is not impressive.2) For the unit I own, the battery never runs 30 hours as Samsung claims. It only lasts no more than 8 hours without playing any photos.3) Recharging battery is a big headache. First of all, you must connect the unit to a computer with Window XP. Sometimes, when I try to connect the unit to my computer, it is not able to get through. My computer does not recognize the unit. I have to restart my computer several times before get the unit connected. Then it takes 4.5 hours to 5 hours to fully recharge the battery. It is ridiculous for a MP3 running less than 8 hours, and then takes 4-5 hours to fully recharge."
2,"Love the features, but...","I have had two of these, but returned both because of battery life problems. I think this player was rushed to market and therefore has a high number of lemons out there. Both units I had would not hold a charge. Let me assure you, I am not a novice - I charged them fully as directed, for plenty of time, even disconnecting other USB accessories to be sure I got a good charge. (In fact, in subsequent tests, I even moved to another PC - a brand new one.) Then I played them with medium-quality WMA music files, equalizer turned off, display off - in short, optimal conditions. In EVERY case, my battery life fell far short of the advertised ""up to 35 hours"". I got anywhere from 10 to 15 hours, tops, before the player ran out of juice. Sorry, but not acceptable..."
2,battery would not hold a charge,"Slick little MP3 player, easy to use, but battery died if I went more than 48 hours without playing it.This is my 6th MP3 player, and one of 4 I have in use, but I decided to rreturn it to the store."
4,Great designs-buy it if you love bead art,"I bought this book because it is the best among the other bead art books. I actually discovered this book from the library and decided to borrow it and eventually purchased it online. Some designs are easy to do but those 3-d designs are quite complicated.Overall, i gave it 4 stars because i managed to create some really nice accessories for a first-timer like myself and the designs are more unique that normal bead art books. Recommended for those who are really into bead art and must be very patient cos it is time consuming!"
3,Third Ear Band - 'Abelard & Heloise' (Blueprint),"Recorded in 1970 in Germany for a 'medieavl' love story that was for a German TV show 'Abeland & Heloise' - total of six tracks (all untitled) with a duration of thirty-six minutes. Couple of tunes worth mentioning are the thirteen-minute opener and the ethnic cut number 3. CD reissue isn't bad but it's clearly for an acquired taste. Line-up: Glenn Sweeney - drums, Ursula Smith - cello, Paul Minns - oboe and Richard Coff - violin. Some might consider it as glorified chamber music."
2,Not what it appears to be,I thought this book was going to be just about Yorkies but it is more a general book with a few added pages about Yorkies. Not what I expected and the grooming section is really pretty sad.
3,OK book,"This book about Harvard Med by a medical columnist in the area, sure enough, imparts a lot of information about Harvard Med.But along the way it suffers from being cumbersome and somewhat disjointed -- the author constantly flips back and forth between the history of Harvard Med, the stories of graduates, the stories of students, the stories of professors, and discussions of research medicine vs. specialization vs. general practice. Mixed in with these are the author's own experiences -- as a neighborhood boy visiting the campus, and as a coddled medical columnist who was allowed to audit the med school's fundamental gross anatomy class, and whose every ail is treated by the country's leading Harvard doctors.After reading the book you'll know more about Harvard Med, but you'll probably see your doctor for dizziness."
4,"Eyeopening look at ""America's Medical School""","A relief to see that this bastion of Americanmedical education is as flawed as any otherinstitution. Fascinating look ""behind-the-scenes"". (Made me just as glad that I'll be attending medical school elsewhere!)"
5,HITCHKOK AT HIS BEST!,"I just love this movie Kim Novak and James Stewart are at their best. This is the classic Hitchkok film. With it's beautiful sets, actors, spcial effects,and the high suspense, this is truly the best movie Alfred Hitchkok ever made."
3,NOT his best! Why is everyone raving about this movie??,"It's good, not great. The storyline is just too basic. Nothing really grabbed my attention. As far as the directing aspect of it, it may be one of his best. But also this may be his most boring film. It was a flop at the box-office. I'd like to know why it's considered his masterpiece. Am I missing something? This movie has little intrigue in comparison to his other films.""North By Northwest"" was by far his best.""Rear Window"" was great.""The Birds"" was very exciting to watch and was a great feat in film-making for its time with all those birds.""Lifeboat"" was good too.""Psycho"" would have been much better if I saw it for the first time without knowing what was going to happen.""Dial M For Murder"" has a great storyline with intrigue.But as for ""Vertigo"", ehh.... not as good in comparison. It will be very good if it is your first Hitchcock movie to watch."
4,Gallup 14 offers a good read!,"Gallip 14 is an exceptionally fast-paced account of an actual riot, trial and verdict which occured in a small New Mexico town in the mid 30's.Racial prejudice, fear and ignorance of the justice system are but a few of the underlying themes of the story.The reader is also led through the trial procedure which culminates in the conviction of the defendants.Especially helpful to the lay reader are the journal entries made by the female protagonist which helps translate the legalese of the trial to a more human aspect of understanding on the part of the lawyers as well as the defendants.This book calls for ""the rest of the story"" and hopefully Mr. Stuart can tell us what happened to his small town and its people when the dust had finally settled."
5,Get it!,"I did not know what i was going to get when i purchased this cd, but now am i ever glad i got it. My new fav cd! The introduction of ""todavia cantamos"" with the crowd going nuts, gives me goose bumps everytime. Wish i could have the original record!"

5,Nice Ring,I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver.
1,What Video!,"I would love to give you a review if you would at least list the titles of the cartoons so I would know whether to buy it or not, and then I could give you a review!Very truly yours,Marty"
4,Nice floor mats for the money.,I bought these for my 2003 Mustang GT.They were very easy to trim and install to fit properly.The only downside to these mats is that the white design is easy to get dirty.Other than that they look great and I continue to get compliments on how they look.
3,good but not what i expected,I liked the book because of the things it teaches you. But I don't like it because of how it is written. It's written in a different type of spanish than I know but it is a very good book. I hope to buy it in english one day for my wife.
1,"Bulky and noisy, and then it simply died","I bought this model for a bedroom and it takes a while to get used to the racket. The fan mode is quiet, but once the compressor kicks in to cool things down it sounds like a locomotive!I would think twice before buying another portable unit like this one, and most certainly would not buy a second ""Amana."" I need some sleep, and this certainly was not considered when they designed this model a/c.Then finally the thing went haywire!A few months into purchase the temperature setting went to ninety nine degrees on it's own, and the unit died a fairly quick death. The warantee replaced the unit after a few thousand calls for repair, during which I had to deal with ""Haier"" not the ""Amana Company""Talk about things not being what the seem - it is just labeled ""Amana"" proving ""Cheap Trick"" is not just the name of a rock band."
4,Thanks Wolfie!,"This is a well put together cookbook with great recipes and photos. What is perhaps the best inclusion is Puck's insights, tips, and side bars to success. The recipes are not terribly difficult and doable.He includes a marvelous section on equipment which is indispensible for the home cook but be on guard for ocassional glitches where the measurement in the recipe doesn't match the directions. Otherwise, this is a book worth having."
3,Mostly encores,"If you do not own any other Puck cookbooks, you will find this book useful and it does contain some good recipes. If, like me, you own several of his other books, there is not enough original material to make the book worth buying."
3,Beautiful book but....,"Beautiful book and I love to watch Wolfgang cook on T.V. but I would never cook these recipes for my family and I would have to make a special trip to the store to get the ingrediants, such as ""Farmers cheese"" not even sure my super market has stock of this item as well as many other items the recipes require."
5,Nice surprise..!!,"Wolfgang Puck Makes It EasyThis cookbook is TERRIFIC.... A really nice surprise. He has great recipes, easy to understand and follow, helpful hints and comments, as well as FULL of great photos of the finished dishes, which was an added surprise...!!!"
4,Classic Suspense.,"The plot is great and so much better than Hitchcock's original. Doris Day is great and James Stewart is too, as usual. For some reason, it seems like his characters are always the same in his films with Hitchcock."
3,"Good Hitch Thriller, but not best","Definatly not his best of the period. Easily rivaled by ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""North By Northwest"". However it can't be denied that Jimmy Stewarts staitforward charm is, as always, enjoyable. Watch the original (1934) for a real treat. Peter Lorre as the villian rivals anything seen in this movie."
2,Watch the 1934 Version,"Best Part: Doris Day singing ""Che Sara."" Hitchcock thought this version of the film was his best, but the first is more deftly edited. In this one, the first 25 minutes could be cut."
5,One of few remakes that surpass the original...,"I am a great fan of this film. I feel that it is truly one of Hitchcock's best films (I do prefer Vertigo and Notorious, for sure though). It's hugely entertaining and exceptionally involving. The film begins almost as a travelogue, and lulls you into a relative ease as you get to know the average American family that makes up the picture's leads. By the time the suspense begins, you're truly involved in the plot. Doris Day gives an exceptionally convincing performance. The plot merely connects together a string of set pieces, but those sequences are masterfully done. The film is scored well and looks great (making you wonder why Technicolor ever went out of style). I give it my highest reccomendation, and think it would appeal to nearly anyone."
2,A disappointment,"I like Doris Day and I like Jimmy Stuart and I like Alfred Hitchcock. I do not like this movie. Boring, stupid, and trite. Buy Dial M for Murder instead. A infinitely better movie."
1,R U guys kidding me ?,"I have also seen good Hitchcock work and frankly I don't know what he was thinking when he directed this incredibly absurd movie. Even the best hitters strike out once in a while and this movie proves that 2 good actors and a good director do not necessarily guarantee success. Sorry guys, I call 'em like I see 'em and this one is painful to see garbage."
2,A Silly Movie,"I love Alfred Hitchcock movies, but this is a silly movie. It's hard to believe that Alfred Hitchcock directed it and that James Stewart agreed to star in it. I found myself disliking all of the main characters and I didn't care what happened to them. In order for a movie to be suspenseful, you have to have some connection with the characters. Doris Day was just awful. The boy, Hank, is an obnoxious little brat. I was hoping that he would be strangled or drowned.At the end of the movie, Doris Day sings a set of corny and poorly performed songs for a group of European aristocrats who would never listen to such common pop music- and are all enthralled by it. What was Hitchcock thinking? Not worth watching."
3,The man who knew too much...,A classic that is still entertaining to watch. Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day are a great pair for this ever-twisting story line. Pretty clean for the who family.
4,Trademark Hitchcock,If this is not the most stunning Hitchcock - Mr Freud does not get a look in and their is very little blood - it is a film that is superior to 90 % of Hollywood fare and stands up remarkably well to reviewing. The English setting works very well and a number of memorable scenes include hero James Stewart escaping a church by climbing its bell rope! and a tussle in the workroom of a taxidermist with staff attempting to save the wild animals from the humans! Good old Hitch. Well worth owning.
3,A CHORUS FOR DORIS,"`Good, not great Hitchcock film is a colorized version of his 1934 production. The picyure starts slowly, giving the viewer the impression of a real stinker to follow. Just the opposite is true. Stewart, Day, and son Hank are vacationing in Morocco when a French undercover agent is knifed in a public square. His dying words to Stewart tell of a secret plot to kill the Moroccan ambassador in Aubert Hall. In succession, Hank is kidnapped by 2 co-conspirators, flown to Londoon in a private plane, and is held as ransom, so that his parents will not divulge the plot to the authorities. Aided by Bernard Hermann's usual superb musical background, the story proceeds logically, with Day saving the ambassador's life and Stewart finally tracking down his son inside the Moroccan embassy. The production still holds up well after 52 years and is a must see for all Hitchcock fans."
4,Well Worth It,Not Hitch's best but still a fun romp. Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day give fine performances and the movie moves at a brisk pace.
3,Shows that Doris Day can act,"When this film was made, people were confused at the choice of Doris Day as the mother whose son is kidnapped. However, Doris Day is outstanding in this, and very convincing. She is more than just 'funny girl' actor who appeared in so many comedies.The film does however suffer from being very dated. It starts off well, but goes pair-shaped halfway through. I'm not a fan of James Stewart, and wonder why Hitchcock used him so often. Didn't he realise that there were other actors around? He acted the same in all his films. Yawn!The DVD is features packed. There's a ""Making Of,"" Trailors and nice anamorphic transfer. Some reviews have criticised the transfer, but i actually think it is much cleaner than the supposedly restored ""Vertigo"" withDVD."
3,"fun, but dated","I was surprised by how weak the story was, for a suspense classic. James Stewart was very entertaining but not especially sympathetic as the loud-mouthed, confrontational, trouble-making stereotype of 1950s American self-righteousness. The much-lauded Albert Hall scene is a flop, suspenseful only because it pointlessly and artlessly postpones its climax. Still, it's a fun movie for all its flaws, and worth checking out."
3,"Among Hitch's most popular, but...","It proves the rule of remakes; the remake isn't as good as the original.Some will no doubt find this surprising, but ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" was first a Brit film, also directed by Hitchcock. No ""Que Sara Sara"" here, as excellent a song as it is. This movie ended with a gun battle, and while it seems slow by today's standards, it still holds up remarkably well.To be fair, this movie is pretty good as well, but it's hardly his best. This is Hitchcock you can watch with Grandma; for his better stuff, check out ""Rear Window"" and, of course, ""Psycho."""
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this movie, having seen several other Hitchcock movies and enjoying them thoroughly. Doris Day was annoyingly weepy and helpless throughout this movie. The Albert Hall scene especially annoyed me for two main reasons. First, Doris Day standing and weeping for 5+ minutes straight instead of telling someone who could protect the target. The second thing was that while both the music and the shots of the musicians were wonderfully dramatic, they were not in sync. There is a prolonged shot of the timpani player playing what appears to be a dramatic cadential ending, yet the soundtrack has no audible timpani at that point, certainly nothing as marked as what the timpanist is shown playing."
4,Terrific Version of Hitchcock Thriller,"This was a story that Hitchcock made in England in the 30s that he redid here. And it is extremely well done.James Stewart and Cary Grant were Hitchcock's favorite actors and that shows in all the films they did together. Stewart is outstanding as a tourist in Marrakech with his wife (Doris Day)and son. The tension builds with a death and kidnaping of the son. And the conclusion is very well done. Recommend seeing this.Doris Day proved to be a wonderful dramatic actress, which she also showed in the previous year's Love Me or Leave Me (playing opposite James Cagney). And she continued Hitchcock's penchant for blonde leading ladies which started way back but intensified with his association with (Princess) Grace Kelly. Later films showcased Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint, Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren.But this is an excellent film that is among Hitchock's best and should be seen."
3,"Overcooked Man, Knew Way Too Much","I'm a big fan and observer of Hitchcock film canon yet I can't see the improvement of this '56 version that he himself and other critics claim over his '34 original. In fact, I think the original holds up as one of his masterpieces, hardly the ""amateurish"" effort he attributes to it while calling this one the work of a professional.Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day (Day especially believable) are troopers and all, no problem with the protagonist cast but you can't beat Peter Lorre as the bad guy in the B&W.; At issue with much of the modern update are the overlong and tedious scenes where brevity could have served, particlarly in the shooting scene and in the howling ""Que Sera Sera"" performance at the embassy. The Master overcooks the suspense here in my opinion."
3,Good movie but a little dated.,"I liked this movie as a kid, but now when I watched it, I realized how naive I was then, and how outdated the plot really is. Enjoyable for the nostalgia."
5,Hitchcock's deep human art,"The Man Who Knew Too Much is known as one of the most ""suspenseful"" films of Alfred Hitchcock.Nevertheless like all other films of Hitchcock this film is not merely a film full of ""suspense"" (which is a very superficial term to characterize the art of Hitchcock) but also a beautiful and distressing example of the deep human art of Hitchcock.The DVD is excellent as regards the visual quality of the film. I recommend it."
1,dont buy it,Its a non-usa version of cleaning out my closet. Three different versions of the same song actually. Such a waste of money. Not to mention not even from the same country
1,nothing new,"well, here we have more radio infesting rap music. and done by a wannabe who thinks he's black. the truth is, rap is not real, it is a horrible fantasy of stupid behavior, violence, and random incompassionate insults. and all of these lies are told by the filth of the streets, who MTV tells us, are our idols. And to make things even more ""real"" the worst of this trash is told by a shreaky little white man who thinks he is doing the ""cool"" thing by taking part in this indecent garbage. dont buy into this especially if you are young. marshal mathers is a fake. rap is a joke, and a destructive lie."
2,"FLIMSY, LIGHTWEIGHT","This toilet bowl set is cheap. The housing is very lighweight and flimsy and will hardly stand upright with the brush in it, especially when you go to put the brush in it a close the stand. The part that opens easily becomes unhooked from the main housing and separates. It has a very small area to catch the dripping water from the brush and air will not dry the area and the brush good after useing. The brush is better, but not by much."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I wouldn't say the remixes are outright bad, in fact I would say they are very similar to the original songs. Overall this is a bad thing because they're not much of a mix to be a ""remix"".If you already own the original album, this really isn't worth buying, not enough changes in the songs to spend the money, even if you really like the original mixes.But hey, if you don't want to spend a fortune on the original and can grab this cheaper, then get it instead, as you might not even realize you have remixes.I would like to point out I haven't heard the original songs in years so I'm comparing these remixes to the originals by memory, so there might be some large differences, but I sure can't recall them. I'd say the vocal tracks are exactly the same as the original, and the overall beats are the same, they have just been changed a bit."
1,Shallow and cliched.,"We rush through inane scenes of characters who just gossip and complain and snipe at each other, just so we can hurriedly get to the central conflict between two immature adults.Blegh."
1,"Still stinks, plus it's pointless","Other than as Nora Ephron's vengeance against the philandering Carl Bernstein, this movie makes absolutely no sense. There is no plot, per se. They get married, he cheats, they break up. So? If this is supposed to be a comedy, it's not funny. Nicholson is wasted, and so is Meryl Streep. Critics savaged this when it came out. They were correct."
1,Heartburn is the least of the ills caused by this movie,"A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull."
3,You have to see this movie in Spanish!!,"Spain has been known for being the country that dubs movies best in Europe. The Spanish title for this movie just couldn't be better: ""Se acabo el pastel"" (""No More Cake Left""). If you see the movie (especially its ending), you'll understand why!!"
2,"Miscasting Ruins ""Heartburn""","Nora Ephron's comic novel ""Heartburn"" is based on the idea of a sassy, Jewish, New York woman being stuck in some hick town (Washington D.C.) where you can't even get a decent bagel. In the right hands the movie version might even have been as funny as Ehpron's novel which is a slightly fictionalized account of her real life divorce from journalist Carl Bernstein.Unfortunately, some bright casting director decided to cast two extremely talented but also extremely WASPy actors, Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, in the starring roles. By removing all the New York Jewish shtick they left a package as tasty as day old Wonder bread."
1,One of the few movies i've ever walked out on.,How can 2 of the best actors of our generation make one of the worst films ever? Heartburn answers that question.Don't waste your time.
1,Don't waste your time,"I just recently saw this movie in my Philosophy class and I have to say that it is the one of the worst movies I have ever seen, second only to ""Shes the one"". Completly predictable and extremly pointless, the highlight of the film is a 1 minute scene where a then unknown Kevin Spacey takes the stage in his first film role. PLease, don't waste your time, you will kick yourself if you do!"
1,Heartburn or Men..beware ! Most women only want to breed !,"This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant ""homemaker"". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too."
4,Much Better Than I Expected,"I avoided this movie when it was released because I couldn't imagine that a film based on the marital breakup of Nora Ephron and Carl Bernstein would interest me. Although I am an admirer of both these folks for their talents as writers, I had always agreed with Richard Burton when he said, when asked if he would be writing about his marriage and breakup with Elizabeth Taylor, that even though love might be dead, that it wasn't for sale. Be that as it may, this movie is certainly worth seeing. Although the plot is a little thin, there are some very funny moments. (Whether some of the events actually happened in the Bernstein/Ephron saga doesn't matter.) Any film directed by Mike Nichols, starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, with cinematography by Nestor Amendros is well worth seeing.Both Ms. Ephron and the viewer have the last laugh."
4,Romantic comedy at it's best!,I loved this movie! Streep and Nicholson have exellent chemistry. The script is very well written and the comic delivery couldn't be any better! This is a timeless love story.
3,plot of movie vs plot of book,"After having read the book, I expected the same enjoyment (if not more) from the movie. The performances were superb but the passion of the story somehow got lost in the 'hollywood' of the movie. Frankly, if I had not read the book I would have had a hard time following the story."
2,gave me Heartburn,Slow and painful..... long ....... painful....... and did I mention slow. Good actors making me feel bad. Now that`s entertainment! The story stinks. I`m so tired of movies with creepy husbands. This movie rewards the jerk with a nice pie. Too good for him. The pie in the face was not sufficient to offset the torture this movie inflicts on the viewer. Maybe running him down with a car or a baseball bat massage.... naaaa not even that could save it.
2,NOT THEIR BEST MOVIE,Somehow the movie never really came together. There were a lot of boring sections. It was a surprise when you consider that Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses.
5,This CD is great,"Billie has changed since her debut album ""Honey to the B."" I this CD, she has a more mature sound that combines pop with rock. This is a great CD."
2,Acting suits her better ...........................,"Billie has a sweet voice that needed electronic enhancement, and the result sounded good. There are a couple of very hooky hit tunes and a fair bit of filler. Unfortunately all the lyrics are fairly trite, so it is just disposable pop music.She's better as an actress."
2,"Billie's second album is okay, but I disagree on one thing.","I disagree that Billie will ever reach to the standards of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. Britney has sold over 20+ million copies of her debut album while Christina is still going strong with the singles from her debut album, 'Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tu) from her Spanish album and her newly-released Christmas album. However, I agree that Billie has definitely matured in many ways and I think her music is great."
2,"Had to buy for class, its not as un-biased as it says","I had to buy this book for a class, maybe thats why it left such a bad after taste, but I didnt enjoy it. It seemed politically left leaning, for however unbiased it claimed to be. However, maybe that was just my professor's spin on it."
3,If you're Bourgeois You won't like this movie,"If you're Bourgeois You won't like this movie. I say that because I watched this movie over a friend's house and a friend of the friend he didn't like the movie and was sitting there grinding his teeth, while everyone else was laughing. This movie is so stupid you have to laugh. If you're the type of person that sits there and picks apart a movie for it's content, then don't waste your time.I'm sure it was made for entertainment purposes only. The cast is mostly from BET shows who couldn't make it and who probably did it for the money.The movie is about some people's dream of hitting the lottery, but these (Bama's from Alabama)folks take the money and move to Beverly Hills."
2,Beyonce Hood,"Actually, she may as well have been hooded for all it mattered. A few frames and a line, and the rest of the film moves on from there. Misleading, to say the least to advertize her as being involved in the movie at all. This disappointment was annoying, but the movie picked up from there. Afterall, Alfred Hitchcock has a larger part in his movies than BK has in this one. But after the initial downletting it turned out to be a moderately entertaining film of the genre. And it was far less insulting to some nicely drawn characters in the movie than similar movies of its ilk, such as ""There's Something about Mary' which went from moderately interesting to goofy. This went from not bad to moderately interesting. I'm not a fan if this type of movie, saw it only to catch a glimpse of Beyonce before she became a child of destiny, but having seen it I thought it was agreeable enough.frank nyc"
1,Amateurish,"This movie is pitiful to say the least. If you are a Destiny's Child fan, that may be a plus for you but other than that, this movie is just bad. It looks like the type of movie that you may have put together as a kid and used your parent's cam corder to tape it. I don't know what the credentials are of the folks who made this movie but hopefully, their skills will get better as they do more films."
4,Beverlyhood,"I received the item before Christmas. It was a gift for my brother. He had been wanting to see this movie but we couldnt find it anywhere. When he opened it, he started laughing. He had to watch it right then. The movie played great."
2,I thought she was able to make a best CD,"It is necessary to hear this CD almost three or four times before you can ""feel"" it.Chenoa's voice is not very particular, so ... you can feel anything she is wanting to tell you. (I can't believe any word she's trying to tell me).Ok, she has the rules necessarys to make some cool movements in a show...But... She needs MORE time, and some better songs.P.S. Forget the idea of singing in english. ;)"
4,The biggest shock to me was....,"what a moron Tonken was. This guy was ""had"" by everyone he approached and he kept going back for more! I mean here's a clown who basically thumbs his way to Hollywood and in a few short years knows virtually every Hollywood star, and ultimately ends up on a first name basis with the Clintons. As I was reading I kept saying over and over, ""If this guy just had a clue, he could have really been on to something really big."" Instead he just kept getting ""taken"", time and time again. The dirt he unsparingly dishes was fairly fascinating, but not really shocking as who doesn't already know what blood-suckers movie star types are. You can tell he feels guilty for what he did(for what thats worth), but he is still very much in denial about how stupid he was. He still likes to put all the blame on all the celebrities who milked him. This guy was so willing, who could blame them?"
5,true sound of soul,"viewing Curtis in concert takes me back to my younger days, when we were trying to find our way, and make a difference, when life had a true meaning, now I look around and wonder what has happpened and what direction society as a whole is headed in. This DVD moves the soul."
3,Curtis,this is probably one of the last live appearances of Curtis Mayfield I expected a better band but Curtis Mayfield was Curtis Mayfield just as I expected.
4,It All Makes Sense,"Howard has written a magnificent book that inspires young and older alike. Howard pulls from great fundamentals of positive thinking and behavior that has been the foundation of many successful people. When I meet a young person that wants or needs some direction, I give him or her a copy of the book so they can see first hand how a foundation is established and why it is so important."
2,This is a benefit of the doubt ranking...,"Normally, I'm a bit more frugal with my money, but I had been looking for a DVD showing the workout the actors in '300' were put through to get them in shape for the movie, and for obvious reasons, I thought this was it.This is NOT the workout used to prep for the movie!!! It's just packaged as the ""300 Spartan workout"" as a marketing gimmick, and gets away with it by basing the workout aroung 300 reps, and gives a brief, irrelevant little reminder of who the Spartans were in the introduction.The workout is effective, but not any more effective than anything I could have (and actually have) come up with on my own. Definitely not worth the $40 they're asking for it."
1,NOT THE REAL 300!!!! WORKOUT,"For some strange reason people believe that it is okay to TRICK people into buying their products. Usually I am more of a discerning shopper, I actually read the reviews before I purchase any item that costs 40.00. However, I was so caught up in the excitement of 300 that I didn't do my research and find the real one for free online. (men's health) I am pissed, this is NOT THAT WORKOUT, if you are looking for something that you may have not done before and are not sure about the results, and/or you have some time to waste or are not already serious about your workout by all means purchasse this dvd."
1,Does Steve Maxwell sond anything like Mark Twight or Logan Hood?,"Ok I found this video when ordering a copy of the movie itself. I checked it out here because it is a blatant rip off. The trainers for the movie were Gym Jones founder, Mark Twight, and member Logan Hood. The Gym Jones site has the ""300"" workout on there site. Funny thing is the now famous workout isnt a work out or plan at all. It was a test they invited to participants to partake in. Links for the test itself and the so called program can be found here:http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=36If you want a plan to follow the true 300 work out is not for you. If you want to be inspired by what can be achieved then go take a look at the links. Dont waste your money on this video if you want what the actors achieved go to the site. Do some research. Do some soul searching. Its not as easy as ordering a video where some hack rip off artist tells you what to do, but it will be more rewarding."
2,good marketing ploy,"For those who are looking the original 300 workout that the stars of the movie used are on mens health website or just put 300 workout on google and the workout is there for free. Now on to the review he does mention the spartans in the beginning section but what marketing I am sure he got his money out of everybody with this workout routine. The reason I gave it two stars is because I finally found an alternative to the hindu push up when I get tired of doing them the regular way. Steve maxwell clearly tricked everyone his kettlebell dvd's were fairly good and then this dvd comes out shame on you. I wish I had seen some reviews of this overpriced dvd before I bought it my mother watched it as I have some of my packages go to their house and she even said that this man was full of it. Bad dvd buy mark delisle, semperfit, or the pit workout much better."
2,NOT THE SPARTAN WORKOUT!!!!!!!,"I just wanted to let everyone know that this is NOT the spartan workout. I, too, was fooled by the title and description and was furious when I received it and found out it's just a low budget home video. I will say that although it was not what I thought I ordered, I gave it a shot and it is a good workout but one that I would have paid $25 for at Target not $60!"
1,Real 300?,"If you want the real 300 workout just search it in youtube. There are videos of Gerard Butler who played King Lenidous performing part of the workout. There are also plenty of videos with gyms showing you the workout. Don't buy this when you can watch it free on youtube, with people who will help you and want to teach you the REAL workout."
3,Not what I thought it was.,"This book has a negative against Christians and their doctrine of hell, or so that's what it started out as. I quit reading it because I don't want to read anything that goes against the bible."
4,Revisiting Mary Stewart...,"I remember before I discovered Ruth Rendell, Elizabeth George, Minette Walters, and P.D. James, my favorite writer was Mary Stewart. I may never read her ""Merlin"" series again, but I still think of it fondly as a great step along the way to good reading. So when I came across a few of her books recently that I may or may not have read 20 years ago, I snatched a couple of them up, anxious to see if they held up over time. I probably should have resisted. ""My Brother Michael"" is an interesting story, and Mary Stewart's writing is good, but she just isn't in the same league as the Big Four. This was an OK read, and the setting was beautifully described, but the story sort of lurched along for me. I may go ahead and read another of the Stewart books I picked up at the same time as this in hopes of redemption, but then again, I may not. The good news: this is a very fast read. : )"
2,Hard Read,To me this is a hard read. The print is small and the adjectives are just too many. I will try to finish - but I am in no hurry.
5,Great experience to re-read after 40 years!,"There is a story for me behind this book. I read it nearly 40 years ago when my children were small. It was storming and lightning out that night and I was home alone other than the two boys asleep in their rooms. For decades I have remembered how scared I was that night reading My Brother Michael. I was so afraid I settled BEHIND a chair with a gun to spend the night - after the electricity went out. Sooooo four decades later I just had to find this book and read it again. I knew quickly why I loved Mary Stewart's books back then and will once more as I collect and re-read them. My Brother Michael does indeed have a very tense scene or two involving some terrible but wonderful discoveries, but I must be braver now as it wasn't quite the same. Maybe today's horror stories have numbed me a little to that, but it is Mary Stewart's writing that makes this one come so alive. Highly recommend."
3,REEEER!!!,"For someone who teaches that we must be pure in thought and emotion in order to seriously labor for spiritual ends, she sure does like to take shots at mainstream christianity and judaism... The Madame flirts with bigotry in this epic discourse of things she probably shouldn't be writing about because the ""science"" she reveals has no practical use for the average reader, or the average reader who thinks he/she is above average."
4,Only half the album is Samba...,"I purchased Inedito after hearing its fascinatingly different version of Waters of March using female background vocalists on Pandora. I wanted to add more music to my Samba playlist, but only 10 of the songs on this album are what I would call Samba. They include nice versions of most of the standards we all know. The others are slow intimate pieces that are beautifully performed. Still, they aren't what I wanted, and so it's not a five star album for me. But if you like the slow stuff too, you will get your money's worth and lots more. For me, I'm still happy because the 10 songs I really like are still a bargain at the album price. The quality of the recording is excellent."
2,"haining, what were you thinking?","not his usual self. famous persons, uninteresting stories. yes, they are well written. but the plots are mostly mediocre, and the collection is an incredibly dull read. i am giving it two stars because of the intellectual level of the writings"
2,Very disappointing,"Although this book is written by one of the best people who have written for the TV series, the actual 'plot' is so thin it could be mistaken for a sheet of tracing paper.It is full of one-dimensional characters who are totally unsympathetic. Even Leela, who the author created, is a little flat. If you want to go for a fourth Doctor and Leela book, I would suggest 'Eye of Heaven' by Jim Mortimore, as this book is far better than 'Last Man Running'."
3,Last man should have waited before running,"Funny thing about Chris Boucher - he wrote 'The Face of Evil', set in a jungle, then 'Robots of Death', a science fiction story with robots. His two novels, which follow on directly are 'Last Man Running', set in a jungle, and 'Corpse Marker', a science fiction story with robots.There is a real resemblance between this book and Leela's first appearance - there are strange and vicious creatures in the jungle, but the real threat is from lost technology.The book's best point is the characterisation of Leela - as the creator of this character, Mr. Boucher shows a real mastery of how to portray her. It would have been better if the story had been different from the earlier story, it would have been more worthwhile."
2,Confusing and disappointing,I was so excited to see a new story with Leela. However this plot was so full of holes that I had to re-read several chapters before I could comprehend what was going on. It's poorly written and the Doctor is not the same person at all that we know from the show. It was great to see Leela actually be the warrior that she is however. It was the one bright spot in the story.
1,Terrible,This is not The Oak Ridge Boys. CD song titles listed do not even match what is actually on the CD.
1,Awful,"Amazon should allow a ""zero star"" rating but 1 star is the lowest I can give it. Give this a miss. I doesn't sound like the Boys at all, and may not be. There isn't a list of performers, writers, copyrights, or anything included with this CD-- it looks like a cheap pirate job."
3,GOOD BEGINNING SCIENCE FICTION,"This book, the first Science Fiction I remember reading after Jules Verne, introduced me to the idea of parallel universes. The hero is a teenager, so this was a book I could identify with as a young person. It takes for granted space travel and living on the moon, two important ideas in other science fiction. It is a simple story, but well written"
5,Brilliant !,"I admit that I apprehensively purchased this cd, not expecting much more than a BITW wannabe. Was I ever wrong. This album is a union of tremendous music and intellectual art. The poetry of Roger and musicianship of the boys blended together seamlessly. The sound effects, classical and WW2 inspired music are mixed in a delicious drink for the senses; as good as any Floyd album. EVER. Much more coherent than The Wall. Blasphemy, you say. Beter music than DSOTM? Yes. A+"
5,Surprisingly lively and interesting,"For the student of philosophy, this book together with a collection of original papers could make a very good introduction to analytic philosophy. For the professional philosopher and others with good knowledge of twentieth century analytic philosophy, it could serve as a roadmap to compare with your own understanding.In spite of a subject, which, in some ways, could be boring, I find this book often very fun and amusing. So far as I can understand it is also written with very good understanding and insight in to it's subject.The chapter on the future of analytic philosophy and the question of which philosophers who will be still famous in the future is well argued and very interesting. And Yes, if you placed your money on Wittgenstein as a star of philosophy in year 2200 there are god arguments that you have made a good investment."
5,Fantastic,"Not just that this is very readable book, but it is multi-layered one. You can read it with little attention, but if you put more attention to it, new things appear.In fact it is so interesting, that I wanted to find some information 5 months after reading the book, and found myself reading it again."
4,Great comprehesive review.,"It was an overall good review book. The emphasis was on review as opposed to the Barron's. The practice exams were a good taste of what the actual exam was like. However, these type of review books should be used adjunct with your textbooks -- although I found the explanations in the answer sections quite thorough. The only negative comment I can make about this book is that it lacks sufficient discussion/sample questions & answers for the Essay section. However, I found studying from the MCAT review books quite helpful as per another reviewer. The style of the essay section is virtually the same as that of the MCAT."
4,Prep for the PCAT,I found this book very informative and helpful in my review for the PCAT. It refreshed my memory on a variety of subjects and the practice tests were very useful.
2,Good Structure but Sloppy,"The book is structured very well but contains a major flaw every 5-10 pages. Some of the examples are worked incorrectly (p. 428, under ""Definite Integrals"" the equation has a '=' instead of '-') and some figures are incorrectly labeled. Everything else about the book is well-done, but I can only wonder what errors I am not picking up that are misleading me."
4,Classic research book,"This book was recommended by a professor in my PhD program. She'd used it while getting her PhD. When she passed it around the class, we noticed her copy was obviously well used. This edition is only 234 pages, but it has a wide variety of definitions and examples of statistical and research methods. It would be perfect for a quick review for an exam or if someone has not taken statistics or research methods course in years."
2,Arista Cashes In,"Though all the songs here are classics, before plunking downcash for this CD and for Volume 2, check out the used CDshops for a copy of the original Greatest Hits CD (first released on LP by Arista in 1978) which included 18 of Barry's songs instead of the meager 10 here. By putting that CD out of print and issuing those same songs as two volumes instead, Arista has shown it's greed and desire to cash in on Barry's fans. Don't let them get away with it!"
3,Well maybe.....,then again maybe not. I hate it when record companies break up the original vol 2 to make 3 additional ones. Just kills it.
1,"Same old, same old","Why is it that almost all Barry Manliow songs have the same formula. Begin with a slow, wistful melody that gradually build to an overblown crescendo, and then suddenly ends with a quick quiet trail off. No less than half of the songs on this disc follow this pattern.Is it because he has no originality?"
4,I Never Regretted!,"I was skeptical about this album initially thinking that Keith Jarrett's gonna sound like he usually does--- rambling and going somewhere where nobody knows (such as ""The Koln Concert""). Surprisingly, this album shows a different side of the Trio. Keith plays objectively. Their rendition of ""Poinciana"" was refreshing. ""Whisper Not"" becomes more than a whisper in my ear as I listen more & more to the album. Definitely an album you'll never be tired of."
4,Be Careful of this disc,"Yes, the musicianship is outstanding, but so is Jarrett's whiny singing that is on every single cut. If his singing along, sounding somewhat like a mosquito in heat, might be irritating to you, don't buy this disc. I love Jarrett and have for many years, yet I plan on throwing this one away. He ruins amazing performances with his singing."
5,The Trio swings hard,Combine one of the best trios alive and a wonderful selection of standards: the result is some of the best straight ahead jazz I have listened in years. The trio cooks and it does what it is supposed to do with up tempo songs. Jarrett is predictably brilliant and the rhythm section is unbelievable. This is triple distilled 4/4 jazz-so sit back and enjoy it without chasers.
4,Classic,"I bought this for my daughter who loved the remake. First she said it sucked, but watches it regularly. Like I said, classic."
1,I'm left wondering who really wrote the other reviews,"In an impulsive moment, I bought this book on the strength of its Amazon pairing with that other book about the pharmaceutical industry, and the five-star reviews. And only after reading it do I wonder how many of those reviewers might be associates of Dr. Kassirer himself. This is not a five-star book, folks; it is one long smear from beginning to end that seems to paint the entire medical profession with the same sticky, filthy brush. Yes, there is a fair amount of spice along the way--isn't that always true of ""exposes""?--but the whole seems much less than the sum of its parts. For my money, there isn't NEARLY enough hard data here to support the sorts of dour conclusions the author would have us accept on his say-so."
2,Yea Its Malmsteen,"I agree that Malmsteen is one of the greatest guitarists in the world. Yet, he ultimately fails to do much of anything except play really fast and technical. What do I mean? I mean he is a great guitarist...but all his songs are downright boring to listen too!"
3,Yngwie's commercial stuff + 2 or 3 great tunes,"This is not Yngwie's best. The CD contanis mostly his commercial music, and not his neo-classical classics he's famous for. It sounds more like pop hardrock than neo-classical metal. even though it does have some good tunes like Far Beyong The Sun or his Guitar Solo but when it comes to vocaled 4min songs, it's as chessy as it can gets. Yngwie Malmsteen is one of the best guitarists ever and I advice you to buy his real stuff, not this collection."
3,"A ok album, but contians one of my favorite pieses ever .","Black Star is the best song on this cd and worth the money alone, The rest of the album is so, so with a few more highlights later in the cd. This was prolly the 2nd most influential cd in my time playing sence I was six, right behind van halens self titled album."
1,Booooo,"I heard a lot about this guy around places, and I like fast music, so I thought I'd check him out. Maaaan, was I disappointed. If you buy this, you're getting 70+ minutes of noise. And not the good kind of noise, either, like DragonForce. DF has some catchy solos. Yngwie has nothing memorable, except probably the opening of Black Star, which is actually nice and slow. Otherwise, he's all ""HEY, LOOK AT ME, I CAN PLAY FAST, PAY ATTENTION TO ME!"" I don't see how in the hell this shmuck could have inspired neo-classical metal greats like Michael Romeo from Symphony X and Timo Tolkki from Stratovarius. To me, it doesn't matter if someone ""pioneers"" a genre of music, as long as it sounds good. So, I couldn't care less that he apparently ""led the way"" for other neo-classical guitar players, he doesn't sound good. He's all speed, and no heart. Or talent. He's just some two-bit egotistical hack who couldn't create a full memorable song to save his life."
1,Acritic,"Yngwie is the most conceited, attention hogging guitar player known to man. I purchased this for a friend.... I had to restrain my laughter while listening to it."
4,"Too Bad, Vandra!","The sound recordings on the clips weren't very good...and maybe this isn't the first Sanborn album you should listen to... This CD isn't the best of his work, but it definitely isn't bad. I like it a lot!"
5,THIS IS AWESOME,This is Jeffrey Osborne's first solo album after parting with LTD. Geroge Duke heads up the Production with a chilling staff of musicians like the great Larry Graham and Louis Johnson on Bass and Paulinho Dacosta percussion and so many more. this is the apitomy of R&B and is his greatest solo effort. A MUST HAVE!!
4,very good album,"this use to get much play and as a matter of fact i still have the tape. the Jeffrey Osbourne and George Duke tag team was on point back in the day. ""ennie meenie"" was my cut, on the wings of love and the classic JO stone cold anthem ""I really don't need no light to see thru you"" is still ice cold. this Brother can Sing/Sang and always had a good balance of material. i use to play this album a whole lot. a very underrated Talent still till this day. very strong debut album."
5,One of his best!,"I'm a huge fan of this man. He is one of the few male vocalist that I idolized growing up. And this CD is one of his best.My favorites are ""Baby"" and ""You were made to love"" but there are a number of cuts that are top notch. If your a fan as I am, you need to have this one."
3,Through treatment of Wesley's beliefs,"This is a very thorough analysis of what John Wesley taught about Sanctification, including his ideas of sin and salvation. It's not the easiest read but a good academic work."
2,Disappointed,"Improbably fashioned or at the very least annoyingly dysfunctional characters who are impossible to care about, with the exception of the wife, who alone seems to react coherently to the situations encountered, and predictable denouement. Was hoping for a much better film, but Chabrol is hit and miss."
4,"Do as he says, not as he does","The graphic design of this book is horrendous, and it has one of the most poorly designed covers I've ever seen. A lot of the examples inside are really goofy too, and really not something you want to imitate professionally.Nevertheless, after giving this book a second shot, I've found it really invaluable. Apparently it's one of the few books (only book?) out there that teaches you, step by step, how to digitally modify and create type . He has some great illustrator tricks and teaches you how to do different lettering effects. It's really broken me out of my comfort zone--before I was stuck using existing typefaces, and now I can pretty effectively knock out hand-done lettering."
1,Not an expert in his field,"I would not recommend any of his type books. If you are looking for a book on logo design or typography, I would HIGHLY recommend Doyald Young's books."
5,Excellent!,"This just arrived about 5 minutes ago in the mail from Amazon, and I can tell already that it it is going to be a great read! Lots of pretty pictures and illustrations just bursting with color. Buy it! This seems to be a very unique book on graphic design with something for everyone."
3,Plutt décevant...,"J'ai acheté ce livre en me fiant aux commentaires positifs lus ici et sur certains sites consacrés à la typographie. Je constate malheureusement que JT Liu (voir autres commentaires) a en partie raison : la mise en page est plutt mauvaise, le contenu semble se limiter à ce qui se fait aux États-Unis seulement et les logos choisis comme exemples sont parfois carrément hideux, tout droit sortis de l'esthétique ""cheap"" du début des années 1990. Je trouve aussi que l'auteur met trop l'accent sur la typrographie et le graphisme d'après-guerre, alors qu'il aurait été intéressant de voir plus d'exemples de ce qui se fait aujourd'hui. Seule la partie technique, consacrée à la manipulation des courbes de Bézier et à l'utilisation de logiciels comme Illustrator et Fontographer (mme si ce dernier est désuet), mérite le détour.Dommage... - retour à l'envoyeur."
3,Shelley Duvall Strikes Again!,"This Tall Tales and Legends episode is nearly impossible to dislike. It is a typically humorous and at times very clever retelling of Ernest Thayer Jr.'s classic poem. The problem is there is too much plot, especially for a production aimed primarily at children. Subplots about corporate greed and industrialization may flesh out the story but at the same time removes much of its charm. Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy in Elliott Gould's understated (is he ever anything else) performance as Casey and Carol Kane as his sympathetic girlfriend. Hamilton Camp and Rae Dawn Chong (yes, this was the 80s!) add some deliciously devious flavor as well, while Howard Cosell is a hoot as the narrator. Fans of the poem will find it basically intact (the actual events of the poem occur in the last ten minutes), but may be less than thrilled with wading through all the filler surrounding it. It has its moments though."
2,Do your research,I want to start by saying the phone works fine. It came in new condition. There was one problem. The day the phone arrived i set it up and it did not work. The phone was not the problem. The problem was with Microsoft dropping Verizon as their provider for web calling without securing a new provider. Microsoft says this lack of service is temporary and i gues we will have to wait and see.
1,Whata ripoff,"Tried to use these phones for Windows Live Messenger calling from PC to PC, and could not get them to work. Uniden tech support less than helpful; told me to call Microsoft. After dinking with these stupid phones for two days, I'm packing them up and sending them back."
3,Great phone for free calls,"This phone with Windows Live Messenger software. Works with phone line and your computer. You must have turn your computer on and your Windows Live Messenger sign in together so do free calls to online contacts, although you can use it just with line phone and use it as regular phone. You can not send text messages.What do you get with this product?- You just make and receive free calls to your Windows Live Messenger online contacts.- Use it as regular phone- Check if you have new emails, new online contacts and new Instant Messages.- Check who from your contacts is online- Do 3 way conferencing, with PC to PC and regular phone calls.- Reminders with Calendar- the phone will not interfere with another phone"
2,Does not support video calls,"This phone does not support video calls (i.e. the audio portion of a video call). I find it absolutely ridiculous that this phone cannot answer an incoming video call, nor can it initiate an outgoing video call, nor can it join an existing call (audio or video) already in session. If the phone did not initiate the call (i.e. if you didn't use the phone to dial or answer), you cannot use the phone on that call. Thus, the phone is absolutely worthless if you want to use it to handle the audio portion of you video calls! I know some people use Live Messenger for other purposes, but for me, the reason I use Live Messenger is to do video calls with my family... If I want to do an audio-only call, I just use a regular phone."
4,An action-packed thriller that keeps you up at night.,The fact that what took place in this novel could happen in real life is mind-boggling. I enjoyed this action-packed thriller because it came so close to the truth as we know it. It causes one to stop and think about previous elections of officials and how the media paints them depending on how much clout and money they possess. The characters can almost be matched with some of those well-known to us that hold high office today. This book kept be awake because it was one that you could not put down in the middle of a chapter. I will be looking for Stephen Cannell's books when I am bored with the usual shootem-ups.
2,story takes a fall and never recovers,For the first 250-300 pages the story is rather entertaining. After about halfway through the story the writing becomes weaker and will bounce around (but never recover)as totally unrealistic scenes get typed out by desperate fingers.Some of the characters are given outrageous (and useless)nicknames and the text is sprinkled with words and phrases that could have been left out.
3,Very Clever and entertaining - kinda perdictible,"I thought the author had a very clever idea. It was interesting how they presented the presidential candidate and how close that is to today's politics (a candidate with no ideas and just a general theme). I thought the characters, especially Lucinda, were perdictable. I don't understand why they had the senator from Las Vegas sleep with Lucinda then nothing came of that. It was an entertaining read overall."
2,Conspiracy 'A-Go-Go',"Slow moving tale of ""The Godfather"" meets ""The Fugitive"" meets ""Whitewater"". Full of wooden female characters and odd side trips to Catalina Island and Tel Aviv.Good info for anarchists on how to steal broadcast television bandwidth.My mom loved this book; she loved the 'A Team', too"
2,David Bowie Please,"Hrm... this album was disappointing. I bought this album because I had heard that these guys are ""glam rockers"". I had also heard their t. rex cover of twentieth century boy and I liked it. but then again, it was a cover. I bought this album and I have listened to the whole thing, I did not enjoy it. It bored me to death, the music has very little depth and its not catchy. Dont get me wrong, I am all for new artists. If you are an aspiring glammie then buy some David Bowie, Gary Glitter, or T. Rex for starters."
5,black market rock,"this was the first placebo cd i bought. i could not stop listening to this cd and played it constantly for at least a year. now i still listen to it sometimes - im surprised im not sick of it by now. seriously, ive gotten other placebo albums since this one (without you im nothing, sleeping with ghosts) and, while very good, they just don't compare. every song is a favourite, but id have to say 'taste in men', 'special k' and 'haemoglobin' stand out.NB; this cd is a bit heavier then some of placebo's others. maybe thats why it may be a little disappointing to some..."
2,I don't like it,"The case was broken when I got it. Because of that, the cd got scratched and didn't work as expected."
5,forerunners of change,"neuron charging, feet stomping, pulse elevating surges of sound that explosively surpass the general world of music. These are pioneering musicians who tactfully cull the most amazing sounds, flesh them out with stimulating lyrics and deliver the aural delicacies with elegance and extreme energy. This is what rock should be like in this century: something ground breaking and enduring!"
4,A Great Sound,"After thrashing their previous album, ""Without you I am Nothing"" for about a year I was keen to get a listen to their latest offering, ""Black market music"" having heard the first single from the album, ""Taste In Men.""When it was released I dropped into my nearest music store for a listen and was pleasantly surprised by what I heard. While the unique sound of their songs was maintained it was a clearly different style than their previous offerings. The songs were far more racey and bass heavy than their older material, such as the acoustic guitar driven ""Every you, every me."" Their were also a few contrasting ballads, such as the durge like hidden track, ""Black market music.""The overall sound of the album was excellent with no weak tracks at all and makes for a great listen from start to finish."
3,solid deja-vu,"Well, for those who expected the band to go a notch higher than ""without You I am nothing"" , there may be a lot of dissapointment with ""Black Market Music"". Its exactly the same Placebo formula only with cranked up guitars and an ever present androginous Brian Molko, with more bleeding lyrics.Not much creativity, not much development, not much challenge taken, but nevertheless a solid and consistent production for the trio.In ""Black Market Music"", the rawness of their first album is somewhat balanced with the melancholy of their second.As a whole, the album defines the band and shows its integrity without going any further than what it had achieved. For those who don't know Placebo, this album may turn out to be a worthwhile promising discovery.Favorite tracks on this album : ""Days Before You Came"" ""Special K"" (the 2 are very similar), ""Passive Aggressive"", ""Narcoleptic"" and ""Haemaglobin"" and to a degree, ""Taste in Men"" which, in my opinion matches half a ""Pure Morning""."
3,Deja-vous has set in,"On the back of two outstanding albums, Placebo have released a moody attempt at being alternative. Opener Taste in Men is an original electronica composition that distances itself from the trademark Placebo sound. A nu-brand of metal is introduced with Spite and Malice which features rapper 'Warfield' who stereotypically warrants the explicit lyrics notice and fails to impress. The remainder of the album returns to the traditonal Placebo formula of soaring/descending guitars as Molko's unmistakeable voice bleeds through the distorted guitars.'Slave to the wage', 'Special K' and 'Days before you came' highlight the brilliance that we have associated with the negatively love-lawn band but also how little they have progressed from 1998's epic 'Without you i'm nothing', the same hooks are here but they are just that, the same."
5,Big Bill's #17 of 2001,"Appropriately titled Black Market Music. Placebo play jangly rock that has a sort of a twisted darkness to it. The slower songs are deep and emptional. The real prize here though is the vocals. The singer sounds like no other. Best songs are Slave to the Wage, Narcoleptic, and Black-eyed; which features some more lyrics that could best describe this album...""Borderline and schizo/product of a boken home""."
4,"It's alright, however WYIMN was far superior.","This album is somewhat disappointing after the band's exquisite 1998 sophomore album Without You I M Nothing. It appears to me as if Placebo took a more commercial route here, recycling the same hook, along with their trademark sexual references in several songs, only this time it doesn't sound as emotional & convincing as it was on WYIMN. There are some solid songs here however (""Taste In Men"", ""Days Before You Came"", ""Special K"", ""Passive Aggressive"", ""Blue American"", ""Slave To The Wage"" & the surprisingly good rap song ""Spite & Malice"") that make this album worth buying (& the four starts of course), however putting ""Black Market Blood"" as a secrettrack is really unnecessary. Also the bonus songs (The one with David Bowie + the Depeche Mode one) aren't included in the European version, just so you know. Overall an okay album which could've been much better. Maybe nexttime."
5,Their best yet,"This will be Placebos third studio album and i personally think thats its not as good asWithout YouIM Nothing. The album is still great containg two singles Slave To The Wage and Taste In Men, and plenty of other good tracks like Haemoglobin and Spite And Malice there is enough to keep the die hard placebo fans happy. I cannot help feeling a bit dissapointed as i raced to the shop the day it was released and i felt as if i wanted more. This album does improve with repeat listening and im sure that it will be another Placebo classic one day so dont dismiss it on the strength of one listen."
5,Placebo's best,A masterpiece-Placebo's very best album. Every Bowie/Placebo/Suede fan should own this.
4,The Christian Woman's Handbook,"This is a beautifully written book that all Christian Women should read. In fact, our church used it for a ladies bible study. It teaches just how a spirit filled, Christian woman should live her life, even in today's world."
3,Not one of the better studies,"This book is okay, but it seemed a bit fluffy for me. I wanted something deeper and with more meat."
4,Good book on MS clustering however!!!,This is a very good book on preparing to implement a microsoft cluster. The writing is concise and clear. Some of the contect maybe a little difficult for those who have never dealt with clusters. Covers everything you might need to know about quorms and troubleshooting. If you are going to use this to pass the exam(70-224) let me warn you you need to get some experience with the product or you will likely fail. Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone who want to implement a MS Cluster.
2,Watch out for Ubisoft version,Google ubisoft age of mythology to see problems with license key. That's what I received from cdromusa. Item was not the one in the picture. Spend two bucks more to get the full version that allows online play.
1,Agree with dj232000,"We tried several times and could not get the Titans portion of this game to work. This after waiting over a month for it to arrive from the UK, was a huge disappointment."
1,Dont get burned,I received two copies as ordered but it was the Ubisoft pirate version with identical cd keys NOT the official copy that is pictured
1,Not good,I did not like the music. The mood is too low and since I listen to the CD Amazon will only refund half of the purchase price. I will not buy music from them again.
4,Sexy Simon Sings Sexy,"I love her. I bought the CD only for the song ""Life is Eternal,"" one of Carly's truth-telling spiritual pieces that's guaranteed to produce goosebumps, and am liking the whole thing. If you love Carly, you'll love it. She is as sexy as ever."
5,Another Carly Simon Masterpiece!,"Every single song on this album is thoughtful and beautiful. My favorite cut would be the smash hit Better Not Tell Her, and my 2nd is the 2nd single Holding Me Tonight. They are the funnest moments on the album. It gets deep with Life Is Eternal, one of her best songs. Fisherman's Song and Don't Wrap It Up and everything else is wonderful. Carly pours her whole heart in this record. It also has a great booklet, with lyrics and nice little liner notes, and plenty of photos. Carly never stops bringing it, a masterpiece!"
4,"Bullies, Tyrants, and Impossible People : How to Beat Them Without Joining Them","This is the second book I read about bullies and this is the winner.I cannot believe nobody has written a review yet.Due to my education in a military academy, I belong to the ""nice"" club. Behaving and respecting everybody are values and not weaknesses.During my career, I had to deal with bullies, although I rarely lost control, emotionally it was very difficult.I read the book in no time, it is an eye-opener and the best of it, it comes with solutions.What a relief I won't have to join the ""Bad boys"" club! The book explains how the angels will keep smiling."
2,Book is great----,"Book is great. Delivery was horrible! And I still had to pay for it. I'm really disappointed because I needed the book right away and had to wait for it. I didn't receive any notification from Amazon that it wasn't in stock until I went hunting for an answer as to where my book was. Pretty disappointed, my assignment was late."
1,dominican republic...a history,The book is well documented and is one of the classics in the discovery of America.There are typos and occassionally the author lets out his biased opinions...that have a touch of racism.I am personally grateful to the author for this documentation especially since my anscestors were part of the founding and landing parties of the Americas.
3,"Warm, old-fashioned vacation adventure","Ginnie and her friend Geneva discover a mystery on Cape Cod during their summer vacation and pursue a long-lost doll. A simple, enjoyable summer adventure."
5,The Cover Sold Me Then and Now,"I gave GINNY AND THE MYSTERY DOLL five stars for longevity.I'd forgotten all about this book until I recently saw its brilliant blue cover in a used book store. The doll on the front intrigued me when I was a child, and it still intrigues me.(Or am I just reliving my childhood fascination with it?)It was fun to reread the mystery contained it its pages.I'd love to know what today's young girls think about this book. I wonder if the lazy days of summer story telling style would appeal to their busy senses."
4,Set the Anti-War Movie Standard!,"This is another anti-war flick. Seen through several perspectives, though there is a main character. All are struggling with the madness of war and each develops his own sanity formula. It's a movie that you can watch several times before catching all the nuances. The cast is something, too. The name actors all capture a facet of the personality types you meet in military service and carefully exagerate it so that they become charactures that develop a whole."
2,just rent this movie,"I thought this movie was not as good as Heller's novel, but I definitely appreciated the movie with some respect. I could not believe this movie was so badly rated as I really loved the story, but now I understand. I think that this story was just very hard to incorporate into movie format. However, what makes the novel so good is all the different characters in the story, but the movie did not do a good job setting everything up. There is about 10 minutes of silence in the movie that could have been used setting up the story a little bit better. I watched this movie with my wife who had never read the book and I had to keep filling her in to the basic plot so she could understand."
3,"O.K. movie, but a better book.","This film based o Joseph Hellers famous novel,hardly mirrors the excellency of the book, but still captures some of th esscence of the meaning. But if you want to kow what it's all about pick up a copy of the book."
4,Only if you read the book,"Anyone attempting to put ""Catch-22"" on screen should have realized what a tremendous problem it would present. Any success of such an enterprise could be a priori partial - and this film is no exception. Despite very good acting, and generally veritable rendition of the spirit of the novel, the film cannot be considered as a successful stand-alone work of art - it should be seen only by those who read the book, otherwise, a lot of the detail is lost on the viewer, and the action/plot gives somewhat of a ""disconnected"" impression."
3,Not as good as the book,"But then again, how could it be? The title of the book itself has become synonomous with the ""no win"" situation you often get involved in when dealing with the government or the military. The background Heller wrote into the book makes the story that much more interesting and sharpens the idea behind it.The movie makes an effort to follow the book, but it is hard to do and I think it is not so much the fault of the director or the cast as it is the fact that some books just don't translate well into film. This is one of them."
5,B-25,"To read the book and then watch this movie is a mistake. But if you like seeing the B-25 in flight and you want a laff, this is the movie."
5,Those who won't study history are destined to repeat it.,"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.""That's some catch that catch 22,"" he observed.""It's the best there is."" Doc Daneeka agreed."
2,Greatly disappointed,"Well I loved the book by Joseph Heller even though it can be hard to follow at times. The movie, however, was a huge let down. I did not expect it to be as good as the book, nothing ever is, but this was just bad. The cast sounds great, but the acting too over the top if you ask me. Especially Arkin as Yossarian, he just annoyed me. There were many characters I came to like while reading, but this movie doesn't give you a chance to like any of them. So much of the book is left out, which is to be expected, but it doesn't make any sense if you haven't read it. The anti-war commentary is almost completely lost and it has basically been turned into a comedy. Overall this was a terrible movie, especially considering how good the book was. It gets two starts simply for being associated with the book. Don't waste your money, just read the book."
4,Great book to good movie,"Overall, the book carried over nicely to film. There is obviously no way the movie could have the same scope and depth of the book, but it did a good job with what it had. I thought that Alan Arkin was perfect. He IS Yossarian. I was happy to see that a lot of important scenes from the book made the film. However, these scenes weren't always done what I felt was correctly, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Call me spoiled since I read the book first. This is a great movie that ranks right up with MASH as the important anti-Vietnam War films. I thought this was a very good movie, and if I had seen the movie without reading the book I probably would have given it 5 stars."
2,Don't Catch 22. Let it go.,"I saw Catch 22 again for the first time in years. I saw it when I was a teenager in the mid 70's. I thought it was good then. I just watched it again and I couldn't believe how dated the film comes across. The movie has the feel of the anti-war movement of the 1960's. I have always been an Alan Arkin fan. Richard Benjamin was good in ""House Calls"", but the performances seem dated and very unfunny and very unsatirical in Catch 22. The actors seem frenetic in their acting. Time as passed this film by. It has become caught in a timeframe when many films where made from about 1966 to 1973 where they have a feel which dates them. Films like the Godfather was made in '72, but you don't get that 60's feel from it. It still holds up. Catch 22 doesn't."
1,Even worse than the book,"The book stunk; it was a lousy collection of half-baked ideas that didn't catch on with young people until the late 1960s when the Vietnam War became immensely unpopular in America. Hollywood got a hold of it and tried to make Heller's send up of World War II ""relevant"" to the war in South East Asia. The studio missed by a mile. Mike Nichols' direction is so disjointed, the dialogue so poorly delivered, and the characters so stupifyingly idiotic/bizarre that you cringe just looking at it. In the end you'd wished Yossarian had died."
2,What a waste of time!,"This product was a total waste of money and time, the actual rating this movie diserves is a 0 but that was not an option, and I have oddphobia, which means I am afraid of odd numbers so I gave it a 2, if you like war movies then you will love ""booty call"" but dont watch ""catch-22"" unless you are supposed to read the book for a school project or something, in which case you should watch the movie because the book is worse. but hey dont listen to me go watch it for yourself, and if you are some kind of retard who likes to read dumb @$$ reviews then go read the book for your self. oh yea! VOTE NADER!"
1,Catch-00,"By far, this is one of the worst novels I have ever read. Excessively over-hyped as a ""modern classic,"" its little more than a silly attempt at parody. Heller's egotistical love of his own words result in book this is over long and exceedingly boring. The non-linear narrative is little more than a pretentious gimmick while the characters are cartoonish at best and as flat as a piece of cardboard. END"
3,"a noble try ,but this one misses the mark","i'm a huge fan of the novel and couldn't wait to see the movie. after watching it i have to say that they really did try,but somewhere along the way they just got it wrong. maybe they were tring to hard to do the book as is and that wasn't possiable. everyone did a good job,but try as i may i just can't like this film,still some may find it great so it's up to you!"
3,Read the book!,"Alan Arkin was pretty good as Yosarian, but it just didn't make me laugh. More of an amused smile sort of movie.I know it's been said before, but this time it's true;The book was funnier."
2,Bad adaptation from book,"To truly understand why the movie is bad, you have to read the book. The theme is completely lost in this movie. The adaptation is too literal and the sequence was altered where it shouldn't have. However I DO recommend the book which is amazing."
2,"ordered new, came used","works fine, lasts a long time for me as wellas the last person who viewed it. hardly worth my time to think up 4 more words"
2,"Read the book, but watch MASH","Based on a great book the movie was bad when it was first released and has managed to get worse with age. I watched it again recently after re-reading the book and Paul Fussell's personal history of his infantry experience. The book actually reflects reality far more than one would think, the movie is just boring and headache inducing. The book was a literary event of the 1960's, but the movie is just a mishmash of bad dream and war scenes that do nothing to make you abhor war, but everything to make you abhor the movie."
1,"Got the wrong format for a Belgian,European dvd player","Sorry to have to tell, but you sent us the wrong format and so we could not play the dvd. We live in Belgium Europe."
3,Strange movie............,"But the location where it has been made is great, I live there !San Carlos Sonora Mexico and there is still remains of the old movie set where I went horseback riding in the desert with view on the sea of Cortez, great memories !"
1,Leaks after 2 days,I purchased 5 of these and opened 3 so far that all have started to leak. The product is junk but the seller was awesome and refunded my money and told me to keep them because it was cheaper than returning them. I will buy from Northern Tool & Equipment again. Thanks
2,"The ""bad"" David Essex","At times, it seems like there are two sides to David Essex. The good one is the singer/songwriter who has crafted such clever, original gems as ""Gonna Make You a Star,"" ""Silver Dream Machine"" and, of course, ""Rock On."" The bad one, on the other hand, turns out such drivel as the discs ""Centre Stage,"" ""Cover Shot"" and this album, which were all advertised on TV in Britain and designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.This disc is devoted to film songs. But at this point in his life, Essex's voice has a rather limited range and timbre. He often sounds like Neil Diamond, and even resorts to speaking some lines rather than singing them, most notably in his hammy ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" He is also hampered by top-heavy arrangements and a bizarre song selection: ""St. Elmo's Fire?"" ""Together in Electric Dreams?"" What, no ""Flashdance?"" If you were looking for a contemporary Anthony Newley with less pizzaz, David Essex could be your man."
2,looks better than it is,The concept is great and the toy looks cool. I find the pieces do not stay together well like some of the other reviewers mentioned. The directions are also very hard to follow. He is 4 and can do 7-12 legos himself but this he cannot do. I have a hard time figuring out what goes where and keeping the pieces in tight. Not worth it.
3,Erector set - builds 4 models,This is a great building toy for kids but the bolts do not hold it all together for very long - soo tooo easy to lose parts and not be able to build other models.
4,lack of foresight by company,"This is a great toy for our 4 year old. However, they could have supplied extra screws and nuts in case they get lost. My son built the ATV right out of the box and used every single screw and nut. This is bad since they work themselves loose and fall off if he plays with it for very long. We have to be extra vigilant to keep an eye on the parts. As another post said, the headlight eyes pop off all of the time, so much that we just remove them and put them away. Other than those issues, it's a good learning toy."
3,fun construction toy,"this erector set was easier and faster to built for a 4 1/2 year old than the larger set,he needed help thou and had lots of fun when the car was done.Less pieces,less frustration."
4,The Greatest Man Alive,"3XD ""Original Stylin'"" was an instant classic & would be hard to duplicate, but their sophmore effort ""Live From Acknickulous Land"" is a gem from the ""Golden Era"" of hip hop. Even though 3XD decided to cross over on this album it still hits hard. Tracks like ""Mr. Sandman, No Words, Make Ya $, E.F.F.E.C.T, I Got It & I Ain't Tryin' 2 Hear It"" display the rugged & smooth rhyme style of 3XD front man EST. The so called cross over tracks like ""Weak In The Knees, Mellow But Smooth & Make That Move"" still have a street edge because of EST's lyrical word play & voice. ""Ten Lil Sucka Emceez"" is cool story telling. ""Peace Ya Self"" is a bit cheesy but the message is positive. Overall, 3XD delivers a quality CD, a must have from the Philly legends."
2,"mmmmmmmm,not like there early stuff","well i must be blunt here,i dint like this,i canr help but compare it to there first album,so i dont rekomend this 1,spend you cash on thee 1st album,it will cost a bit more,but its wiorth it"
5,Few masters have excelled Hardy's story-telling,"Few masters have excelled Hardy's story-telling in Far From the Madding Crowd. This masterfully written work is undoubtedly one of the single finest exhibitions of the English language.So, the novel's protagonist, is torn between three suitors. Yet, only through her experimentation in courtship with all three, and the suffering she consequently creates and endures, does she discover her proper mate.This is a fine read for all lovers of great literature and should be particularly enjoyable for young ladies."
3,"Long, too descriptive","This is a book that is too descriptive for its own good. I am currently reading this book for the Academic Decathalon and I find it long, uninteresting, and boring. It spends way too much time talking about how the individual trees are while not moving back to look at the forest.I give it three stars for the story, because it is a classic, but overall, I did not enjoy it, because it was too darn long and descriptive. It was a drag for me.My recommendation: if you like descriptive, thoughtful, where the underdog gets the girl, vanity type of books, I'd say go ahead and read this one, you'd enjoy it.If you don't, stay away from the whiff."
3,Nice reference for selected myth,"This is only a partial reference book for fans of myth. For some myth it is hard to keep all the names and relationships in order and this book does a nice of that. Nice graphics and logical flow. The only issue I have is that this book tip toes around the christian, jewish, and islamic myths without proper recognition of the characters and events. Maybe the authors assumed readers would already be familiar with the characters in the bible and koran or the publisher wanted to save paper. In any case it would have been a nice addition making this truely a complete encyclopedia of mythology."
3,Phyllis' first-ever compilation album.,"This was Phyllis' first-ever anthology and includes some of her biggest Arista hits. Unfortunately, much of the material Arista boss Clive Davis (and his cohorts) gave Phyllis did NOT do her talents justice as they tried to make her a commercial diva. The tragedy about artists like Phyllis, Jean Carne, Angela Bofill, Brenda Russell and Patti Austin is that their best songs were album-only tracks which had no commercial appeal (as such, the single releases had to be trendy to some degree). This IS a good CD but the ""Legacy Of Phyllis Hyman"" 2-CD set offers both better value for your money AND a much better selection of Phyllis' music."
5,Only1diva,"The best CD ever! This lady had a great voice of all times. I feel so good when I hear Miss Hyman sing she was so loved, but did not reach her level with the music industry maybe because she was so above her time then came the others. RIP Phyllis you are missed."
2,Not Bad,"The packaging was great but this ""hits compilation"" was thrown together on a whim as her last committment to Arista to get her out of that messy contract to move on to bigger and better things.....on HER terms. Hence the forthcoming Living All Alone (her best selling album to date that she was KNOWN for amongst the masses). She did it her way.I'm a Phyllis aficianado. I have this on vinyl and CD. I never listen to it. I do look at it though."
5,LOVELY,Beautiful album by the Late Great Phyllis Hyman. perfect condition...price was right and it came to me right on time. I've been enjoying it so much while I drive in the car.
4,An Essential Set For Every Observer,"I bought this set in the early 80's and it was invaluable for identifying certain objects in the sky. With each entry, he usually added a photo alogn with an elaborate description of the object. At first I used it quite heavily, but as time went on, I found it much easier to identify the objects I sought. Nowadays, I use Megastar, or the Internet, but still have fond memories of browsing through the pages of this excellent observers guite. Much more detail than you'll ever find in teh ""tourist"" books out there. Still a good bet for the dedicated observer. Highly recommended."
5,Thankfully The Fever Has Broken!!!,"I saw this movie when it was released it 1977 and I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. It concerns a working class guy named Tony Manero played by John Travolta.Tony is a lowly paint shop clerk by day and a Disco King by night. The acting is terrible, the script is hopeless and the characters are all one dimensional.There is one guy with suicidal tendencies in this movie but nobody pays any attention to him because all they want to do is ""get down and boogie"". The Soundtrack is mostly by the Bee Gees who sound as if their testicles are clamped in a vice. I give this movie 5 stars becaause it managed to make the owners of the Discos all rich from their patronage of ""John Travolta Wannabees"". Thankfully Disco is now dead, and Rap will follow in it's wake but good Rock and Roll is IMMORTAL!!!"
2,BORING is today's time.....,"Good music, good dancing, but in today's standards this movie would be boring. I tried watching it and I thought it was slow and boring! I suppose that back it the 70's it wasn't boring."
5,Great Movie,Still powerful 31 years later. A peek into another world ...Brooklyn and NYC in the 70's. Enjoyable from beginning to end
5,Some classics never die.,"For a disco type movie, I think this movie rocks all the way! I can't say exactly that this movie would be popular among the younger crowds, but anyone who's lived through the 70s, I believe will love this movie."
5,Wow,"What a great movie. I just saw it for the first time...and I gotta say, it was awesome. It was a lot deeper than I thought it could ever be. Travolta puts on a star performance. It is really an unbelievable performance, when you think about the tragic death of his girlfriend during the shoot. Overall, this movie is more about one man/boy trying to find himself in the big city than it is about everything else. The working class hero who seemingly has it all but really doesn't have anything at all. Except on the dance floor.The DVD is nice. It comes in a cheap case, which isn't bad, and there's 3 deleted scenes and a VH1 Behind the Music special, which has some cool behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the stars (some that have aged well, others that really, really haven't)."
4,Finally on DVD,"Its good to finally have Saturday Night Fever on DVD. I saw this movie (the R rated version which is what the DVD carries) in theatres in 1978 when I was just 13 years old. Loved the film, loved the music, loved the dancing. The DVD includes commentary which is a nice bonus along with part of the VH-1 Behind The Music episode (I wish they had included the whole thing). There are also three deleted scenes that add up to about three or four minutes - to be honest, I can see why they were cut as they add very little to the finished product. The DVD loses a star for two items: the cheaper package (I prefer the plastic cases as they are more durable) and the missing original theatrical trailer (that really wouldn't have taken up that much space now, would it?)."
4,Disco Fever,Takes me back for a blast from the past.Fun to watch and listen to over and over.Music could have been a little more clear in the re-mix.
5,Saturday Night Fever,"I bought this for my little sister who couldnt find it anywhere new. I made her birthday special because not only did I find it, but I found it new. Thanks for the quick shipping and I would do business with you again in the future.Patti"
5,Can't wait to see the movie.....,"This was a classic movie for the times. Now to see it in B-Ray.. NICE,GREAT the sounds of music over time. Thanks Again"
5,Enough already!!!,"I love this movie, I think it's great. But, please, c'mon, how many more Special Editions/Special Collector's Edition/Director's Cut/Unrated Cut/Anniversary Edition, etcetera etcetera, we will have to endure for ANY DVD we already own? It's amazing the nerve of movie studios to continue laughing at our face with these so called ""marketing strategies"". Give me abreak! Enough already!!!!! Put the movie with all the special ""stuff"" in one DVD. I'm sure all movie fans will buy them and respect you a little more!"
3,Not necessarily conventional,"Due to its popularity, this 1977 release is often hailed as a disco landmark or ultimate dance flick. To me, it has certainly great value in those categories. What struck me more than just the Bee Gees was its intense realism although cast in the popular formula of boy meets girl. This movie was clearly marketed for the youth and shares a place among like films such as ""Star Wars"" (1977), ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Close Encounters"" (1977). The claustrophobia of the working-class Brooklyn neighborhood Bayside is subtly interwoven in the spectacle of bell bottoms and gyrating hips. But the film has, in my opinion, a clear psychological dimension: frustration, meaningfulness and the pains of growing up with limited mobility. Interestingly this movie is almost the opposite of, say, ""Grease,"" which is nothing else than a large over-iced birthday cake. ""Saturday Night Fever"" reminded me of sentiments I felt when watching ""Midnight Cowboy"" or even ""Rocky""! Go see it."
3,The Greatest Movie Of All Time,No movie captures a period as well as SNF does....and since it was produced during the time that it covers (the disco era of the late 70's) it's right on...An amazing performance by JT...with the most popular soundtrack of all time....a real keeper for anyone who grew up going to clubs...or anyone who wants to know what life in the buroughs was like in the late 70's....my favorite move of all time...i've seen it 100 times.
3,Saturday Night Fever (30th Anniversary Edition),"What can I say. It's been 35 years since I've seen the movie. It was one of my favorites back then - loved the music and dancing. The music is still wonderful and probably the only thing that kept me watching it until the end. The acting was so-so and it reminded me that I really don't care for Travolta in the first place - hard to believe he was nominated for an Oscar. I didn't and don't live in a big city but I definitely recognized some of the characters as people I once knew back then. Sometimes revisiting things of the past should be left well enough alone. I'm glad I watched it - it showed me how much I've grown, matured since then. But I doubt seriously I will watch it again."
4,Great,"I received my package quick, and product delivered also in great condition. Very satisfied.!! I never have had any issues this far. Dvd was a gift and they really loved it, and again came earlier then expected even better.!!!"
3,TRAVOLTA CARRIES THIS MOVIE!,"Like another reviewer said, I too grew up hating this film. I was a young teen and a rocker and would not be caught dead watching this film. I have seen it many times now and I think it captures that 70's disco time period perfectly. Travolta is the whole show and of course the classic music soundtrack. The DVD has a good transfer and weak extras."
3,Enjoyable but not great,"Travolta is a great actor, no dout and his acting is the best part of the movie. He absorbs the role perfectly.I enjoyed Staying Alive more.Seeing the cultural decadance of the era in both movies is not fun but both were enjoyable."
4,the 1970's disco era,one of my favorites. great music and style. this 25th anniversary edition is better than the 30th anniversary one. there are still more deleted scenes that were not shown. i have a VHS copy from broadcast tv which was far more better. at least there were no foul language. still a great and fun movie. hope that paramount will release another edition. everyone dance & enjoy.
5,Great DVD,"I received the DVD way before its due date and it was in pristine condition! Thanks so much!Gabrielle BrodieElkins Park, PA"
5,great movie!,"I was born in 1986, 9 years after the movie came out. I LOVE this movie. John Travolta is great in it and I don't even like disco. Its a fun movie to watch and the dancing is great."
2,ok,"IF YOU LIKE DANCING, you might like this movie...otherwise ...you might want to watch something a little more challenging."
2,BORING in today's time.....,"Good music, good dancing, but in today's standards this movie would be boring. I tried watching it and I thought it was slow and boring! I suppose that back it the 70's it wasn't boring."
1,How Men Abuse Women,This is one of the worst film's to come out of that era. This film treats women like objects and not human beings with feelings and emotions. The film's only point of view is from the perspective of John Travolta and if he can win the prize. And what is the prize? Not clear! That does not say much for the spirit of man.
5,When is this coming out on DVD?,Does anyone know if and when this Disco classic will be coming out on DVD. I can't believe it hasn't hit the stores. It would be a big seller.
5,Ne York disco scene and dumb italian hoods a laugh riot,"Maybe the best of the 70's for it's comic value alone and it's way groovy disco-era tunes, SNF its completely entertaining. Joey, Double-J, and the band of merry idiots are hysterical, and Travolta shakes it on the dance floor making all viewers pumped to deck out in polyester and hit the clubs. It's a riot!"
2,Another Perspective,"This film was unnecessarily trashy. That detracted from it to a significant degree. The dancing accurately captured the comical energy of those days, but the plot and characters were all somewhat shabby. The moments with the family were humorous, but the aimlessness of the characters was depressing.What happened to Karen Lynn Gorney after SNF? It was her introductory movie, a national blockbuster, and we never heard from her again."
4,SNF Revisited,"I saw this when it came out and decided it would be fun to see it again. I think there is about 30 years between viewings. I forgot about the truly nasty language and the ""in your face"" sex talk. However, loved it anyway."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Saturday Night Fever has some memorable dance scenes and a good performance by Travolta, but the reason it made such an impact upon its release (and still does today) is because its storyline is so unformulaic and unsentimental--expect a good film, but not a sweet little dance movie."
3,"Great Film,....OK ""Special Edition""","Have always enjoyed SNF. Great acting, directing, phenomenal soundtrack and a satisfying ending. This 30th anniversary edition is a bit weak in the extras department. Granted, some of it is pretty good like Double J's return to Brooklyn, but where on earth is John Travolta? The STAR of the film is nowhere to be found on the 30th anniversary SPECIAL edition?! Pretty pathetic. Good, clean picture quality and sound throughout. Great 70's time capsule and worth the twenty bucks to buy."
4,Worthy upgrade but poor packaging,"This disc (circa 2007) has better picture quality than the previous disc, and offers informative and entertaining bonuses. It is in every way an upgrade. But the packaging, while nice, is not practical. If you hold it up by the sides, the disc sleeve will fall right on the floor!Don't worry about this Blu-ray and HD-DVD stuff (I own a Blu-ray player myself), and just get and enjoy great DVDs like this. No firmware upgrades, and it just works. And looks and sounds darned good."
5,excellent to stimulate writing,"I love this book for a few reasons. One, it is whimsical and very tongue-in-cheek. The dog's 'life' is a great example of personification and a great lead-in for explaining 'voice' to my students when teaching them the process of writing. It helps them 'see' (due to the unigue style of font use) and 'hear' the dog and its feelings in a very clever way. This book has opened many avenues of creativity for my students and really helps them be better creative writers. I read some of the previous reviews and was a bit surprised at the negative comments. As a teacher, I feel kids should be encouraged to read and read often. The language is not immature and actually introduces some good vocabulary, which gets students looking to find out what they mean and how to use them. I think this book is a must for all elementary school classrooms. I have one in mine and highly recommend it. All my students have loved it and I do, too."
5,As much fun for parents to read as for kids,"The boy notices his dog coming out of a limo wearing a sharp-looking tuxedo. He follows the dog the next night and discovers a whole different world in his dog's life. The dog runs a nightclub where ""dogs can be dogs.""I enjoy the colorful illustrations and the sense of humor in this story especially the animated words. The type looks like a little boy's handwriting, which involves you more into the story. This is one of the few books I take pleasure in reading to my child rather than dreading ""another long and dull story."""
4,An ok purchase,"Book was not in best of shape-- 2 pages torn out-- but for a kid's book, 10 cents plus postage is ok... Just taped the pages in. My grandson loves the story!"
3,"Good, yet basic and abstract, not enough about Bon itself","I appreciate the Bon lineage very much and am glad for any serious book on the subject. In this book you get a good, if not quick, introduction to the lineage and history of Bon. This book is really more like looking through the keyhole at Bon rather than opening a door.If you are interested in Bon then a most excellent place to start is right hereHealing with Form, Energy, and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and DzogchenThis book makes learning about Bon extremely experiential and you really get something substantial from it. All of Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche teachings are very helpful, clear, and easy to connect to. Highly recommended."
2,LOTS of mistakes,"This book is entertaining and well-organized; unfortunately, it's not very accurate. Some of the author's mistakes are due to credulity (it's possible, but not likely, that Butch Cassidy survived his final gunfight in South America; O'Neal reports it as fact); some to partisanship (he's an unabashed Clantonite in the matter of the OK Corral, and thus again reports speculation as fact); and some to ignorance (he doesn't seem to be aware that Florentine Cruz and ""Indian Charlie"" were probably the same person). The history of the American West is treacherous territory, and nobody can avoid a few mistakes, but Mr. O'Neal seems to make more than his share. I can't recommend this book."
1,Request,"Dear Amazon,People trust products ""sold by Amazon.com"". To keep it this way, please consider somebody with a high-school diploma look into this one, and categorize it together with weight-loss magnets and tin-foil hats."
1,"This product is a hoax, please do not be duped","This product is a hoax, a ground strap only works by connecting the wearer with earth ground. This device does not do that."
1,Doesn't Work,"I purchased this product, because I am in a computer repair class. I didn't like to have to be attacted to the computer, like you have to do with other antistatic wrist bands.The first day I used it, I didn't have any ESD. I really thought this was the product that I was looking for. Unfortunetly the last 2 days, while wearing it, I have recieved numerous ESD, which could have destroyed the computers I was working on.It seems that that ESD is less when I wear it, but it is still there. I am so very disappointed in this.Anyone who purchases one, should really test it out for a few days, to make sure it is working for you."
5,Very nice design for large wrist,"I have large wrists. This has a twisty flex band that is quite comfortable on, and it seems to keep me free of static buildup without need for a grounding strap. Once it's on, you don't notice it at all."
3,Modifications,"Product Overview/Tour:The stretchy band is made of metal, and the blue block is made of plastic. The screw near the ANTI-STATIC sticker is for decoration and doesn't hold anything together or provide any other use. The sticker hides a nut that a screw goes into from the bottom/inside of the bracelet. From what it seems, the plastic block is also used in one of Cables Unlimited's other anti-static straps.Pros:More comfortable than any other static bracelet that I've worn.Cons:Needs to be wired instead of ""wireless"".Other thoughts:Don't fall for the wireless hoax; this bracelet is not going to make static magically disappear into nowhere. Do yourself a favor and modify the bracelet (if you do want to spend the money for this bracelet) to make it into a wired one. It actually may be cheaper to get a stretchy metal band from a watch (or a spare from Wal-Mart or somewhere) and make one that is wired yourself.Minus one star for price, and minus one for the lack of wire."
5,My son loved them,My son loved them. I will be buying him some more. All the neighborhood kids are ordering themselves some too.Thanks again
3,Suspiciously like...,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This whole ""concocted"" story of this being a Lefevre product is highly improbable. I was around in 1978, lived in NYC from 1978-1982 (arguably the hight of this type of dark, electro disco popularized by the likes of Patrick Cowley, Tantra, Man Parrish, etc, hung out with popular NYC disco DJs, and I NEVER heard of Black Disco Club. These Black Disco songs sound suspiciously like another French group of the Euro version of disco, circa 1978. I am referring to none other than Space (three albums.Space, (formally ""Didier Marouani & Space""), were a French electronic music band from the city of Marseille, active from 1977 through 1980. They are considered as one of the most notable artists of the short lived space disco music scene, and early pioneers of Eurodance electronica sub-genre.Is Black Disco Club a tongue-in-cheek ""homage""? A blatant copy? Or a genuinely obscure, brilliantly dark band recently re-discovered?You decide!"
5,Irreconcilable Differences,"A work that is as equally disturbing as it is enlightening. Junge takes a much debated, written about subject and turns it on its head. It is difficult, even long after the reading, to reconcile that Hitler cared about his dog having puppies, had a fatherly hand in Junge's marriage, even that he paced back and forth nervously as he waited to hear from Eva Braun when Munich was bombed. How does one reconcile the evil of Hitler with the humanity of Hitler? An amazing and necessary read."
2,Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary,"There is certainly nothing new in Junge's account. Junge is very careful to always make herself appear in the best light possible and has done the same in the many interviews she has given during her lifetime. When one reads the book by O'Donnell, ""The Bunker,"" one is astonished by the alleged remarks that Junge, a junior secretery, stated that she made to Hitler. Other, more reliable witnesses, have given commentary on Hitler's demise, yet Junge claims to have heard the 'shot' that killed Hitler, unbelievable. Like the Speer books, Junge has survived and lived well by being the repentant Nazi. A more truthful account could have been written in cooperation with Gita Sereny. Save your money."
1,Until the final hour:Hitlers' last secretary,"Sorry to burst your bubble,but this book was totally boringly written.And didnt have very much ""inside info"" in it.If you like to know stuff like exactly what he ate at mealtimes, and just human habits in general, then I suppose this book will have redemptive value.I certainly didnt deem it a collectible whatsoever."
3,Good Set,"Good set of tools just keep in mind its only a 14.4 volt, 18v are more convenient and not to mention more common when it comes to finding other tools and using the same battery or replacing the battery. I work in construction/home remodeling and theses tools have definetly served their purpose and their not nearly as expensive as DeWalt."
5,A journey to the dark side,This book was a great adventure into the demons that haunt us all. Done very cleverly as heroes from the past and the present are used to help face and conquer these demons. A great read..........
5,Pleased as punch,"I bought these when I got my Phonic 780 Plus amp/mixer. I run a standard 25' 1/4"" cable to each and they sound loud and clear. I used them at my church to amp my family's band during a performance, and they were more than up to the job. They especially handle the bass well, but there are lots of highs in the sound too so its not all woofer. I also can run my iPod through the amp and the sound is very nice. Just like a home stereo. Nice, rounded sound. Not too high, not too low.I will say, however, some of the plastic pieces (handles, corners) seem a little thin compared to some more professional equipment I've worked with before, but I am happy. The woofer grill seems pretty solid. It's rigid plastic, but plenty tough enough. And the price was right."
3,"Price was awesome $28, but I had to repair it","This item arrived with a rattle inside the case. I took out the grill and speaker and found the crossover board had come loose. I epoxied it down and put the screws back in... all is well. With Shipping my order total was $53.78... I hooked it up to my fender passport amp (75 Watts) and cranked up my Guitar... All is good. I will need to add a speaker stand mount to it (cut a hole in the bottom and screw it on)... For the money, I did all right... if you can't take one apart to fix it, this isn't for you..."
5,Loud and Clear,"I purchased a pair of these speakers to replace the ones I have been abusing for over ten Years. They have performed better than I ever expected as I used them for Karaoke, some good some bad. They survived feedback,blown amps and out of key screaming. I couldn't believe I was still able to get them at a great price including shipping. Very pleased with Amazon this year! Jim"
3,BARE BONES DVD,"The film is midly amusing and does have plenty of nudity in it to make up for the bad acting.The DVD, however, has no extra features in it whatsoever, not even scene selection."
1,Don't waste your time,"A really bad album. I've been a fan of McGuinn's for at least 40 years, saw him in concert with the Byrds and Thunderbyrd (great shows), but like so many of his solo albums, this one is truly cringe inducing. As bad as Peace on You. A great lineup of musicians goes to waste on this disc. If you are not especially familiar with his work, don't start with this one."
1,Una Porqueria de Album - Basc Trash that anyone could write!,"I bought it recommended by a friend who likes perfect Pop (I.E. Beatles, ABBA, Oreja de Van Gogh). This has no melodies and is just sour Rock."
1,the sqirrel the hare and the little grey rabbit,"very poor re-do of the much loved series, very poor pictures, would never have bought, if l had seen 1st."
1,Trite Gothic Horror,"As far as I'm concerned, this book is a waste of time and money. The book is poorly edited with numerous typographical errors. It is filled with child abuse which may or may not have any basis in fact. It deals poorly with the issues of child abuse and domestic violence, portrays women and children as victims of a patriarchal society and church, ad nauseaum. There are many far better books for adolescents that deal with all of these issues and leave one thinking rather than numb at the end."
2,Monotonous and boring,"There is no soul to this game. It's all just about numbers. You have to visit every state regularly or the state begins to turn to the other opponent--no matter what ads you have in that state. In the end, it's about visiting every state as often as possible and putting out more ads than the opponent. I got 5 organizations to back my candidate, and still broke even with the opponent (who had none), so it appears the organization sponsorship is a temporary benefit. I played this game once, took about 2 hours, and now I'm ready to give it away. Could have been much better. Another gripe I have is this: why can't you choose any other party besides the two big ones? What about libertarian, etc? This game was too short sighted."
3,On the right track,"My hat is off to the developers and concept people. I hope they continue on with this and can create a truely complex simulation, at least offer something more complex as a option in their next title. You have all sorts of people you can hire, media consultants, spin masters, web masters, ect........ but not alot of depth into what they are doing in any given state other than ""being there"". Keep in mind that this game deals with the issues and the mood of the country in 2004 at the time this game was being put together. I'd like to see an option to download, update poll numbers on a daily basis based upon REAL polling data. There are polls conducted state by state all of the time and they could easily go with the most current."
3,Give it a chance,"Its not nice to trash a game before its release just because you don't like the subject.Past games in this genre have been very interesting, though none of the CD era games rivals the old Campaign '88 I played for hours on my old Commodore 64.This game has glitzy graphics and is pretty dumbed down, but it looks like it could be fun. For $20 it seems like a worthwhile ride.JEC"
2,Pretty Cheesy,"I am not sure where it gets all 538 electoral votes -- DC is not there. No debates. Unrealistic rules. For example: it should be possible to set up a multi-state advertising campaign without visiting each state indendendantly, and reproducing the same ad. Likewise, the positions are divided in support by Dems, Ind, and Reps, there is no assignment per candidate. -- In other words - no track record on positions. Additionally, it is unclear if any candidate is deemd the incumbant.I bought the gane before the post election price reduction. I did get enjoyment out of it, but could have gotten more enjoyment out of the same $ with something else.One review mentioned fun for Democratss, and not for Republicans -- I don't get that analysis. It is pretty easy to win or lose with any candidate and any party."
5,Awesome value for the price,I've had this game for a few days and have really enjoyed it. I love playing the campaign mode and at higher levels it can become almost impossible to win. It has enormous replayability by using different cantidates and different strategies.There are a few things that could be better. It doesn't cost more to advertise in large states so your strategy usually won't include taking a large number of the smaller states. Also election night isn't as good as it could be. It goes from state to state showing how won but it could provide more information and also more suspense by having close states being undecided instead of called right away. Supposedly they are making up update to deal with these issues though.The bottom line is that the game is really fun AND really cheap. You can't really go wrong for this price. You'll have hours of fun.
2,Long overdue idea. Poor Game.,"First, I had no issue with getting my copy to function.Having said that, you aren't missing much if you can't get it to run. It is pretty boring and repetitive. It essentially boils down to moving from state to state, giving speaches and buying ads. The problem is that doing these things consists of two mouse clicks. The screen shots show all these interview shows and such, but they are pretty minor in the game.I was hoping it would be great fun, but I got bored with it after and hour."
2,Would be lots of fun if it only had a brain,"In the 1980s, there were lots of really intelligent political games, like SSI's President Elect for the Apple II. This one adds some delightful board gamey features, but the creator clearly has more experience designing games than reading about how politics really works. Typos and misuses of terminology abound (candidates are called ""president-elect""), and a goofily Bill O'Reilly-ish world view pervades, depicting the Democrats as out of touch with independent voters. When you go to campaign in California and are told that both Bush and Kerry are identically ""pro-environment,"" you realize how much games have been dumbed down since the glory days of SSI's ""President Elect"" -- another game designed by a Republican (Reagan always won), but with way more smarts."
1,zero compatibility!,"watch out for this game. it is only compatible with a thin minority of computers (as far as I have experienced). It only works on certain brands of video cards. So even if you have a great video card, if its not on their list, the thing won't even start. As far as programming goes, that is just terrible. I don't know what they were thinking. So be warned- read the sys req list CAREFULLY and be sure you have one of their listed video cards. otherwise you will be disappointed."
3,Target scope,The scope is clear but the light transmission is not as good as other scopes that I own. I will not buy another one.
2,Make Suree You Know What You're Buying,"I purchased this book for my sister, who is single, in hopes that she might finally land a man. Turns out, finding a mate isn't exactly what this book is all about.On the positive side, she can now strangle a person using tall ornamental grass."
5,an excellent book on the subject,"In the usual Ragnar fashion, he gets to the point and illustrates exactly how to do it and do it well. Someday these skills will be needed and I thank people like Ragnar for showing us how to take responsibility and protect ourselves and our families -- from whomever or whatever,"
4,Man trapping,I found this book to be more than I was ready for. It is a remarkable book on how to defend area with on site materials. Great reading and I have tried some of the tactics and they woked very well.
4,Fascinating and educational,"A fascinating and educational little book. It begins with the basics of a guiding philosophy, then a relatively detailed description of 3 types of triggers, followed by descriptions of several interesting traps. Ample detail is given in the text and the illustrations are helpful. I would have liked more step-by-step illustrations in some cases to clarify some points but still they were sufficient. The writing is at an appropriate level and complexity for instructional text and was very readable. The size of the book makes it easy to slip in a pocket and take with you as a ready field guide when you want to give some of these a try. The tools you will need are quite simple and you could easily get along with a knife, saw, and a hammer alone to make all the traps in this book. It is an interesting anthropological study of human ingenuity in itself."
2,Mantrapping?,"The traps are marginal at best and instructions are vague. For informative trapping techniques and diagrams check out Dale Martin's ""The Trappers Bible"". There are better book on the market for the same cost..."
4,Zombie-X,"ManTrapping another great trapping book that will teach you how trap your enemys in some very nasty ways including a deadly snake trap so next time someone ticks you of at the office buy this book set them up and take-em out or just give them and there family a scare and let them know just what kind of person there dealing with.parchase and have some fun,lots of fun."
3,Just bought looking forward to reading from this author.,I just got this and his other book and the advanced man trapping techniques because of reading reviews on how funny and entertaining this author can be. (guy from work suggested) I will try to update once i finish actually reading both.
4,Submissive archetype & the dominant partner...,"From the opening 'rope trick', this movie kept moving. ""Inspired by the real-life Leopold-Loeb murder case"" is the snippet on Netflix. Well, this is such a different thing in some ways - especially considering the age & interconnectedness to their victim. Stewart was ... well... himself in this film. Nothing surprising and his face broadcast nearly everything he was thinking. Farley Granger was crawling the walls during the entire party - and it was fun to watch him slowly come unglued. Like the ""Telltale Heart"" - the elephant was in the room with him and he couldn't bear it. But I was glued to John Dall's oily self-assuredness. Everyone on the film was completely charmed by Dall. This would be a good one to update..."
4,Experimental thriller from the Master of Suspense,"Rope was an experimental movie, filmed on a single set in as few takes as possible. The idea worked. The sun sets over the New York skyline, and day turns into night as the net gradually closes in on the two killers. Camerawork and lighting, a major challenge in view of Hitchcock's unprecedented requirements, create a haunting, tense, almost broody atmosphere.Writers Hume Cronyn and Arthur Laurents work well with Patrick Hamilton's incredibly old-fashioned stage play, producing a sharp screenplay. The cast are generally excellent, even if Jimmy Stewart looks a tad uncomfortable in an atypical role."
2,Not up to expectations,Not the usual Jimmy Stewart or Hitchcock movie. Found the script and actors boring. I do not plan to recommend it to any Stewart or Hitchcock fans and collectors.
5,"I disagree with ""official"" editorial review","How on earth could the official amzaon.com editorial review,although generally accurate in its praise and decription of the film,say that this is not among The Master's top achievements. Please recall the year was 1948 and also recall what Hitchcock actually accomplished:make a seemingly simple screenplay that unravels ENTIRELY within the confines of a dining room turn into a nail biting classic. How many directors around today(or,for that matter in 1948 could pull that off??!!This is defintely amomg my top Hitchcock favorites,and,forgive me,but I appreciated ""Rope"" more than ""Rear Window"",which unto this day is still hailed as THE Number One Hitchcock."
5,HITCHCOCKs MOST DISTURBING FILM,"1948's ROPE is a thoroughly enthralling and disturbing look at a thrill killing perpetrated by two prep-school chums (John Dall and Farley Granger) possibly suggested subconsciously by their unwitting professor (James Stewart). This film has often been characterized notably only as Hitchcock's great experiment. He shot it in ten-minute takes contrary to his stylistic use of effective story telling through editing. This was a technique that he also employed to a lesser degree by Hitchcock in 1949's UNDER CAPRICORN. However, ROPE is first and foremost a riveting tale bordering on the perverse."
5,Splendid flick,"Though this film, as others have said before me, is not hailed as the best of Hitchcock, it is most certainly one of my more favored. Jimmy Stewart is a loveable, honest and moral hero, and the villains pyschotic. The suspense killed me, to coin a phrase... I can watch this movie innumerable times and it continues to voice and express its unproclaimed charm."
4,Rope on DVD: Pros and Cons,"Hitchock's Rope is my favorite movie, and I have anticipated acquiring the dvd for some time now. Yesterday, it happened. Here are the pros: the dvd contains the original trailer, which is quite interesting; the dvd contains an informative special feature documentary with Hume Cronyn, Arthur Laurents, and Hitch's daughter. Here are the cons: The dvd is not in widescreen, and the picture quality, although better than any other presentation I've seen on video or on television, is not as crisp and clean as I expected it would be. You can see the blue hues shifting, and this is a bit distracting.If you're a big fan of this movie, I would recommend buying the dvd; otherwise, you can live with the video."
2,Not Hitchcock;s Best Effort,"This film suffers from the same weakness as another weak Hitchcock film with James Stewart. I cannot get interested in a film in which every character is boring and obnoxious.Two spoiled, wealthy jerks murder another spoiled, wealthy jerk for kicks. Who cares? Rupert, a snobbish prep school teacher played by Stewart, is suspicious for obscure reasons.Unlike most Hitchcock films, the whole thing is predictable including the ending- no suspense whatever.This film is boring and trivial. A waste of time."
2,Too gimmicky,"A very gimmicky film on a couple of levels. First it's shot all in one long shot, actually several shots spliced together more or less unobtrusively to look like one shot. Second, it all takes place in real time in one location. This, along with the plot, make it seem like an Agatha Christie play. Two young men (supposedly homosexual, but I didn't notice) murder a friend because they are ""superior"" creatures. Then they invite the murdered man's fiance and relatives over and serve dinner on a large chest where the murdered man is stashed. Gee, I wonder where David is tonight? He was supposed to be here. Stewart plays their old schoolmaster who taught them the Nietzschean doctrine, but who discovers the murder and is horrified. Hitchcock's first color film."
5,Best Smoking Movie Ever.,"Blah blah technical. Blah blah stage play. Blah blah Leopold & Loeb. Blah blah Jimmy Stewart. Blah blah 'master of suspense'. Blah blah wooden acting. Blah blah continuous reels. Blah blah macabre philosophies. Blah blah boys' club. Blah blah Cedric Hardwicke. Blah blah wordplay.It's time we saw this for what it is - the Best Smoking Movie Ever. The last act is wholly dependant on a cigarette-case. Everyone lights up all the way through.An absolute must for fans of tobacco in film, up there with any noir you care to name.(Note: best cigarette in a film, however, must go to 'The Exorcist', where the doctor examining Regan steps out into the hospital corridor and lights up while talking to her mother.)"
3,Was this Hitchcock??,"I kept waiting for this movie to get better. And it never did. The begining is interesting, but it drags, and the ending is a disapointment."
4,Nice Classic by Hichcock and Stewart,"This is a good classic made in the late 1940's and is in color, which is hard to find. Almost 80% of it was shot is a small set dipicts a mid sized apartment, something that I hardly see. It also gives viewers a good picture of the young Jimmy Stewart, who is a professor that is first suspects and figure out the strangling of one of his students by the two students that live in the apartment.Thsi movie also puts on a lot of attention to the philospher Fredrich Nietzsche, who idea was that it is best for only the most powerfull people should live. That is what the 2 gays have in their mind for this movie.The only hard part to this movie is triing to find the scene where Alfred Hitchcock is pictured in."
5,"""Rope""","It was a gift for my daughter. She really likes the movie, which is one of my favorite Hitchcock thrillers."
4,"A Powerful, though imperfect, experiment by Alfred Hitchcock","ROPE was an interesting watch. The innovative ""long takes"" was clever and entertaining to watch and Hitchcock really worked well with this unusual tecnique. Jimmy Stweart is wonderful and his monologue at the end was a truly honest and wise realization of his personality. It is a great ""moral"" that really breaks your heart. The script is an interesting work of black humor wit and intelligent ramblings. Farley Granger does well with his guilt-ridden murderer role. I liked the ""murder weapon cleverly disposed of"" theme with the rope around the books, a similar ironic and black comic twist used in ""Lambs to the Slaughter"", an episode from his famous TV show."
5,Hitchcock and Stewart at their best!,"I can't give any Hitchcock film less than 5 Stars. The man never took home an OSCAR, but always took home many fans. This film is one of the best that Stewart did with the great director and Farly Granger was excellent in it. The twists and turns and macabre manner in which it's written and directed is brilliant. Buy this film, watch it and you'll see why it's a classic!"
4,DEFINITELY AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT,"What makes this film rather unique is the well-known fact that Hitch took a gamble and experimented by filming this movie in 10 minute takes without cuts or interruptions to provide a seamless flow of movement rather like a filmed play. The result is not overwhelmingly successful yet it holds the viewer's interest nevertheless. Based upon the notorious Leopold and Loeb case of the twenties, Granger and especially Dall (he's a chilling psycho) do well in their roles; Jimmy DOES seem a tad uneasy in his part, yet he's terrific in his final scenes. The always welcome (what an eccentric pain) Constance Collier does well as an ""amateur astrologer"" and the gal who plays the boys' housekeeper expertly gets on the viewer's nerves! Hitchcock's first colour film."
4,Good but not great,"Excellent characters and performances carry a movie that is rather simple in its plot, set and film style. if you liked Dial M for Murder, you will likely enjoy this Hitchcock film. If you are expecting something like North by Northwest or To Catch A Thief, you might be bored."
5,A Hitchcock classic.,This claustrophobic tale takes place in one evening in an upscale New York City apartment as two friends celebrate their perfect murder with a dinner party.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:John Dall is great but the movie's continuous-take experiment doesn't really work and the ending is flat; it's often entertaining but must be seen as a failure coming from the Master.
5,ingenious,"ingenious idea almost perfectly executed. great idea, great acting, great directing, editing, writing. the ending is a little sorry as i find is typical of a lot of hitchcock movies, but all in all a great experience and one worth owning"
3,"Decent product, needs power supply","I bought this docking station a few months back. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with it. Most problems are Vista related. If you run dual monitors and unhook from the docking station, Vista often doesn't recognize it and still thinks you're running another monitor. Updating drivers helped a lot. The fact that the docking station doesn't come with a power supply is joke. Especially for what they were originally charging for it. Prices have come down a lot, but it's still a big issue. I wish the laptop could plug into the dock with connectors like the Dell docking stations (direct connections built in), instead of a cable that plugs into the side. It works though, so I'll live with it. Keyboard and mouse are average. I thought the small built in speakers were decent for their size. Definately an upgrade from the laptop's own speakers. I'm still glad I bought it, but it definately could be improved."
2,many drawbacks - beware,"I purchased this item (which included the wireless mouse and keyboard) very inexpensively last year, and even after 2 receivers, the wireless does not work. Admittedly, being able to have a docking station setup for the printer and separate speaker system and mouse is great, but the sheer size of the thing is a drawback as well. It is certainly not worth the price I see listed. You might want one for less than $100, but beware the wireless aspect. There are a lot of complaints about this product on various sites."
4,Captivating,"This novel is difficult to put down. The characters are deep and relatable, and the story twists and turns to keep your rapt attention."
2,On the bad side of 'so-so',"The story was reasonably interesting, but the conflicts were trite and contrived. What she made her characters agonize over made me roll my eyes. By far the greatest weakness is her nebulous writing, not to mention downright grammatical mistakes. She takes half a page of forced and painful prose to say what could be better expressed with economy. It was a big long blustery book which could have told the same story better if her editor had taken a pen to it before it hit the presses."
1,Not good. Not good at all.,"I had high hopes about this book, and sadly, those hopes were dispatched literally 100 pages into the book. The exaggerated writing style didn't bother me as much as the plodding narrative. In my view, everything seemed contrived. There's a story in here to tell, a damn fine one at that, but it just wasn't done in this book. A prequel would have been helpful, or at least a few chapters as a historical backdrop."
3,Very talented and absorbing,"The book was very absorbing. After getting past the first part I found myself hard put to put it down. With that said I must say that I don't like the ""mood"" of the story. The entire book is very depressing. It was a good story but a tragedy. Janny is very good at pulling your emotional strings. I just wished they were pulled for a lighter mood. I don't need any help feeling depressed or angry and frustrated."
3,"It's been a while, but...","It's been a long time since I read this book. If I remember correctly, I picked it up soon after it came out in paperback. It was enchanting-looking; I remember particularly being struck by the quality of the maps.Then I read it, and ... well, I was hoping for more, really. I was impressed by her collaboration with Feist in the Riftworld-spinoff Empire series, but this really fell flat. I often found myself bored, which doesn't happen frequently.Maybe one of these days, I'll get around to reading the sequel, but I rather doubt it. I was disappointed, to say the least."
1,They cut down trees to make this book?,"Pure and simple..this book was terrible. It was very boring and didn't seem to go anywhere. I put it down after about two thirds of the way through. I couldn't handle it. It's like staring at a rock for days waiting for it to get moving only it never does. Sorry Janny but I think I'll stick with Goodkind, Feist, and Tad Williams."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I read about half way through this book before I decided it was a waste of time. The characters are all interesting, the plot is interesting, but it draaaaaaaaaaags. I give two stars for the potential of the story, if she would just get on with it! I totally lost interest. The only other thing I've read by Janny Wurts is the Empire series and I loved it. I was disapointed in Mistwraith."
2,"Good Characters, Slow PLot",This book did not hold my interest at all. Out of the hundreds of books I have read this is the only one I have not finished. The characters are fairly well developed but the plot of the story is rather dull and unexciting. next to a few interesting pages I found this book to be a disappointment.
5,WOW!!!,This is my first Janny Wurts book and I was impressed. I wasn't able to put it down after I started it! The characters have so many levels to them. A very enjoyable read.
1,"Oh, the pain, the pain....","What can I say? I read constantly, mostly Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Historical fiction, and because of this addiction I almost *never* fail to complete a book, no matter how painful. This time, however, the pain won.What was the publisher thinking with this? Did they feel the need to publish a 'filler' fantasy series for us constant readers? This was awful ... and I actually waded through books seven and eight of Jordan's WoT without giving up!I have never felt so non-caring about a story's characters that I did with the two protagonists. Read the last few lines of the Kirkus Review - they sum it up pretty well. Read GC Kay, GRR Martin, Terry Goodkind, even one of the first half-dozen of Jordan's now lamentably bloated WoT - but *avoid* this book!Do I sound resentful - you bet! I resent having wasted my time trying to involve myself with this novel. But if I can save just one reader, my pain will not be totally in vain."
1,Worst thing I ever read,"There is absolutly no back story. Are the other ""worlds"" really worlds or other parts of the same continent/planet? Why do some writers seem to think they have to create complex names that are impossible to pronounce or remember? Too many characters. Too much change of heart for the half-brothers, back & forth. Characters appear out of nowhere & accepted by main characters like they have known them forever. Too many ""kingdoms"" and the relationship between them is never explained to my satisfaction. I know this is volume 1 in a series and more will probaly be expained later on, but to get readers to continue, I would think you would want to include a littel more history to keep from confusing us. It was like walking into a movie halfway through. If this is an example of how this writer thinks, I will never read her again. I'm glad I bought this at the library bookstore for $.50. It was a waste of my time."
1,"I'm a patient woman, but not THAT patient . . .","I know with some epic fantasies there is a lot of exposition before you get into the real story. So I waited, and I read, and I waited, and I read on . . . and on, and on, and on, but the book never went anywhere. I'm a fanatic reader of fantasy books and am pretty darn easily amused, but I couldn't even finish this book. Maybe the real action started in that second 700 page book, I'll never know."
2,"Good political science, poor science fiction","This book had too many characters, and too little action. Wurts spends all her time studying politics and human nature. If you love political science, you might enjoy this book, but I've been trying to finish it for months, and every time I start to read I fall asleep.Oh yeah, and she uses obscure English words just for fun, like she always has her Thesaurus open on her desk as she's writing. Words should be used with precision, not as a club, or to show off.I guess I didn't like the book much."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I got so bored of this book that I had to put it down many times. I had to force myself to finish it. I then gave it to my friend who liked it and went on to buy the other volumes to this series so at least my copy did not go to waste. It seems as if most people enjoyed this book, I for one did not."
3,Tall Tales and Legends: Pecos Bill,"This movie is definitely for a younger audience. It does have some adult humor in it too. I needed this for my middle schoolers and so it did not meet my particular needs. My children liked parts of it, but since it is an older film it did not hold their attention for long."
5,Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales & Legends - Pecos Bill Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales & Legends - Pecos Bill,"I am a second grade teacher and I have used this DVD for the past five years as a supplement to my Tall Tales Unit. My seven and eight year old students absolutely love this DVD. Adults will recognize the all star cast. Students enjoy the exaggerated costumes,colorful sets, and the action scenes. This would make a wonderful birthday present for a child, especially if it came with a book about Pecos Bill. I highly recommend this DVD."
5,Pure Directorial Genius,"The Nerds trilogy is neatly resolved with some of the best comedy I have ever seen. Director Roland Mesa, albeit a menace to a civilized society, nonetheless has given the world what could only be termed, Zen and the Art of the Nerd. Fine, fine writing. Even finer directing. Take one home and put it under your pillow. Perhaps, you will be able to direct something this good someday."
4,I thought this was a great sequel.,"I liked this one alot better than the others, the ending was great when I saw all the nerds from the first and second film grown up. What happened to Pointdexter, I didn't see him in this sequel. Oh, well this is still a good movie if you like Revenge of the Nerds."
1,Please stop!!!,"I loved Revenge of the Nerds part1. Part 2 was OK, but could have been better. By Part 3 I am saying to myself ""WHY?"" The story line is so off the wall, if you can call that a story line. A Rapping Elvis wanabe named Toyota! Then at the end they try and push that guy off as Gilbert, PLEASE!!!! We all know were the guy who played Gilbert went, have you seen ER? Not even a good number of the original cast memembers making a small one minute showing at the end could save this one!!"
4,Annotated Lolita Review,"At first when I started to read the book Lolita, I didn't really find the book interesting. This was because I didn't know what the book was about or know that the beginning of the book is slow. Once I took the time to actually read through every page in the story, the plot and action started to pick up like no other. The suspense and ideas that were going through my head while reading this story was crazy. I had never really read a story about an adults romance with a child, which made it awkward for me at first. But once I kept reading and got used to it, the story was simpler for me to read, even though it may have had other readers uncomfortable. I feel that in this book, there is a lot of things discussed and questioned that normal authors wouldn't write about in their writing, which is why I think this book was a good selection. Although many others may have different opinions on the book, those are just some of the things I wanted to point out and say. Very good book!"
4,For the scond time you read Lolita,"A great help in following Nabokov's classical allusions, translating his French passages, and following the structure and plot of Lolita. The introduction is a little nerdy but the author's personal acquaintance with Nabokov and his solid annotation is essential to understanding and fully appreciating Lolita."
5,Glorious,"The only thing better than reading Nabokov's original masterwork (again, and again) is to hide away for a few weeks with A. Appel's annotated version. Simply majestic. It's like having your favorite dessert (cherry pie?) AND your favorite vintage champagne. Now if some brave scholar would only perform the same task for ""Ada""..."
3,must have,"Buy this book. Appels annotation doesn't only explain the book, but also show's you how to read."
2,Don't Know What To Say,"I have somehow avoided this book for a very long time, and finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. I can report that it is indeed beautifully written. I can also say that it is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. The book is considered Nabokov's finest work in English. I hate to say this, but I do not plan to read any more of his works."
5,Why to buy the annotated version,"I recommend you buy the annotated version of this text because without the notes it is impossible to catch all of the word-play Nabokov uses in this book. The annotated version will give you a richer experience with the novel, well worth the extra cash. Few, if any, readers are skilled enough to catch all of Nabokov's allusions. In Lolita, there are over sixty allusions to E.A. Poe alone! Even if you are good enough to get all the allusions, anagrams, and other word games, did you catch all of the Lepidoptera imagery/metaphor?...What's Lepidoptera?...It's the word that's making you think, ""Hmm, those notes might not be a bad idea."""
5,Complete control of the english language,"For someone who natively speaks english and studies Russian, it is astounding to think someone could write so eloquently, so densely, and so poetically in a tongue that was not their own. The annotations are virtually vital to decode the layers of references and aphorisms seeded into this remarkable masterwork of fiction."
5,How detailed is Appel's research...?,"Needless to say that the annotations, along with the critical introduction, are so extensive that they almost achieve the impossible task of exhausting a work of literature. But if you're wondering just how much you should appreciate the efforts of A.A. in researching the literary history of H.H., consider this: LOLITA is the only book to be annotated during an author's life with the author's assistance. Apparently Appel ""consulted"" Nabokov so relentlessly that the author put a restraining order on his annotator. As H.H. hungered for his Lo, A.A. annoyed this modern-day Poe. So go on and shell out a few bucks more for an edition that adds a another dimension (if inadvertantly) to the themes obsession and literary creation explored by Nabokov."
2,"Too much TRANSLATION, not enough ANNOTATION","My beef with this book is that too many of the ""notes"" consisted of translations of the little french phrases nabokov's narrater (monsieur Humbert Humbert) uses. Although I have not gone back and counted, I came away with the impression that AT LEAST HALF of the annotations consisted of simple translations of simple french phrases, which you could find in any french-english dictionary.There are, mercifully, a few good points in the annotation that enhanced my understanding of LOLITA somewhat. The butterfly-references, in particular, are nicely correlated. ""Metterling-Schmetterling"" grumbles Quilty as he is about to be shot to death--that's really brilliant. I wish there were more of this sort of thing in the notes."
1,Terrible Kindle conversion,"Obviously, this review is not meant to be a judgement on the quality of either Nabokov's novel or the annotations that accompany it. Whoever supervised the digital conversion for the Kindle of this special annotated edition should be summarily fired. Clearly, no one actually tried out using this product as it was intended. The annotations do not appear within the text as links, and jumping back and forth between the text and the notes at the back of the book is damn near impossible. It's a fascinating work, but the only way to enjoy it is with an actual paper copy, at least until someone who knows what he or she is doing supervises a second try at this one. This could have been so cool; the perfect book to show off all that is possible with the Kindle. Could have been, should have been, and would have been if anyone had cared. Shame all around."
1,DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF ANNOTATED VERSION,"Does anyone at Kindle understand how to format an annotated novel? The hard copy and paperback versions of this great annotation have notes running along the texts. They correspond to the commentaries at the end of the book. Those commentaries edify the themes of ""Lolita."" (That's the way annotated books work, folks.) Kindle's electronic version and its iPad adaptation do not have references on the pages of the text, so we have to GUESS when to go back to the annotation section to see if there even are any notes. DUH? Kindle really scammed us on this one. It's the only Kindle book I immediately demanded a refund for. If ""Lolita"" wasn't one of my favorite books, and if the annotations in the paperback copy had not been so handy and valuable, I wouldn't bother reporting this.Write to Kindle, folks. Demand that they reformat this one, because the effort is worth it!"
4,fine intro to jazz 'bone styles and players,"If you're a trombone student, and you want a one-stop survey of jazz players and styles, this is the album for you. You won't get trad (tailgate)(New Orleans) and you won't get contemporary cats like Wycliffe Gordon or Robin Eubanks, but otherwise you'll hear a wide variety of conceptions and tones. The liner notes are informative and well-written.Are these the absolute best single cuts from each player included? I dunno; probably not. Do they suffice? Heck yeah.(And if somebody wants to propose a different collection of tunes and maybe some different players, they should go for it, and if they can get it pressed on CD, I'll buy that one, too.)Happy listening!"
3,Region 1,Unable to view this DVD on Australian players. I had previously purchased region 1 DVD's from Amazon so not sure why this did not work. Able to watch on Notebook.
1,Very brittle bit,"I submitted a large order for these bits but was very disappointed. In a one day project, I BROKE over a dozen of these bits. I was screwing new 2"" zinc screws with a 14.4 volt Rigig cordless drill on low-speed/high torque (the correct setting for screwing). It is the tip of the bit that breaks off."
4,Redback Phillips bit,The bit has good grip on screw heads but may strip some out that are made out of a softer metal. I would recommend!!
5,An inspirational commentary,Munk is one of the great commentators. He provides an inspirational reading of the Seven Days of Creation. A work which will deepen faith and understanding.
2,Really?,"A group of guys stumbling around in the woods telling stories and looking for bigfoot. Camera appears to be a home video camera, and not even HD. I think the camera operator is drunk as the camera is shaking constantly and out of focus much of the time. And they don't find bigfoot, huge disappointment."
3,Not the best,"Part 1 surely wasn't finished is that why it is called ""Part 1""? Kinda' home-movie quality but if you have the time it takes to watch it...give it a try."
4,"Must have, but some filler","This release has several fine pieces on it. ""Althea"" is a fine example of the unique Dead sound with the lead guitar flowing around the vocals in a sinuous enveloping polyphony. The price of this album, for me, was redeemed many times over by the medley ""China Cat"" / ""Rider"". As has been stated by voices far more eloquent than mine, this segue represents the finest the Dead have to offer. Like so many of the better of the band's medleys, it's hard to pin down when one song relinquishes and the other takes over. It just doesn't get any better! ""China Cat"" has been a favorite of mine for 30 years. That improbable polyphony is just way over the edge. We do miss him, don't we?"
4,"great Fall '89, Summer '90 live dead",The China/Rider on disc 2 from 4/1/90 from the Omni in Atlanta is one of my personal favorites. Worth the price of the CD.
2,Jerry Has Checked Out,With the enormous wealth of dead live material available this should be very low on your list. They are obviously (to me at least)well past their prime here and only surviving as a novelty. Sure there's lots of great instrumentation here but you've heard it all before and heard it much better.
4,Possibly the Dead's finest live album.,"Yes, yes, I know, that's a lot like picking the best James Bond movie. With an insane number to pick from, why choose one? Not to mention the fact that I hate live albums to begin with. So why do I buy them?Because every now and then I come across one like this that makes it worth it. An album that sounds completely new even if I've heard every song before. No other ""China -> Rider"" I've ever heard can match this one. No ""Eyes of the World"" has this one's lulling beauty. No other ""Cassidy"" has the fire heard here. The first time I heard this ""Help -> Franklin's Tower"" I had to stop what I was doing just to listen to the playing. (Lucky I wasn't on the highway at the time.) This is the Dead in peak form: playing as if they're sharing one mind. Listen and be carried away..."
2,Too too much Brent Mydland,It's way too much Brent for me. It's like the microphone was only in front of him! Jerry is impossible to hear and the piano dominates the vibe of half the songs. Booby sounds good when you can hear him.
2,It's Over,"My favorite Dead eras are '68-'69, and '72-'74. I understand the fanaticism that surrounds the band, but anyone who sees ""rebirth"" in '89-'91 instead of ""death rattle"" is over-optimistic. If Brent had an ailment like throat cancer, I apologize in advance for unintended cruelty, but his singing blows chunks. The synths and MIDI are real downers too. This is the Eric Clapton-ization of what was once adventuresome, boundary-pushing music into sanitized, watered-down muzak for the yuppie masses. I am off to perform aural exorcism and listen to Live Dead."
5,Does not get any better than this!,"Not even sure where to begin. I got this album back in 1997 on a whim, and I think my CD player wore it out. From the opening riff of Feel Like A Stranger to the ending of Dear Mr. Fantasy, every song is incredible. China/Rider flows into a smooth jazz like ensemble, Looks like Rain has the patented Bobby Weir vocals on it. The best two songs on the album are Eyes featuring an incredible solo by Branford Marsalis. His saxophone playing just jams away with the sound of the band. One can not tell that he just showed up without any rehersal to play. Help-Slip-Franklin's Tower is the best version of the trio I have ever heard.If you are new to listening to the dead, or have been a fan for years, there is no reason NOT to have this in your collection. One of the greatest albums of all time, and in my opinion, the greatest live album by any band. Enjoy!"
5,GRATE BUT NOT THE DEAD AT THEIR BEST,This is one amazing CD. The Eyes of the World is simply spectacular. If you want to hear a Dead song that come from the heart listen to that. Althea and Walking Blues show you exactly how broad the Dead's talent is. This cd has a bit of everything in the Dead's repertoire. Cassidy is a classic that can never be missed and One More Saturday night is at its heart pumping best. Feel like A Stranger gets this cd off to a jump start and you never look back. Buy this cd and enjoy it. Its a gem.
4,?,We purchased this pillow to take on a long flight. It worked great to sit on or use as a back support. The down fall is that it really smells like rubber :(. We also bought a vinyl invalid ring which i would recommend highly.
2,Not really a dictionary - more a regional glossary,"This little book is an informal glossary of regional (mis)pronunciations, rather than an actual dictionary of the Cajun dialect.If you want a few good-natured laughs at rural Louisiana speech, you'll enjoy this book. If you are serious about studying the Cajun dialect, look elsewhere for a comprehensive dictionary."
1,NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!,"This is advertised as a tri-ply pot -- but what I just received was an ordinary steel pot with an aluminum disk brazed to the bottom. In fact, the pot I was sent looks nothing like the one pictured: the shape is different, the lip is different, the pot is different.$99 is not a bad price for a tri-ply stock pot, but one can buy a disk-bottom pot of similar quality just about anywhere for half this price. I'd have to say this was a complete rip-off."
1,burns and stains,I thought I was getting my wife nice pot for a present she wanted. First time use food burned and stuck to the bottom. The bottom inside and out stained as well as the inside walls. I can't get the stains and some of the food burn marks off. My $20 pot from Wal-mart does better than this. Not Happy at all! Contacted Calphalon and they are sorry but they don't make this pot anymore. They did not offer and exchange or an upgrade. Nor did they do anything about the narrative describing the pot. Be carefull and check to see if the item you are buying is still a good item with the manufacturer before you buy! I guess I'm stuck with a 99.00 flower pot.
2,Calphalon Contemporary Stainless Steel 12 quart stockpot,This is my first purchase of a Calphalon encapsulated bottom pan. I own other Calphalon pans that are 3 ply stainless steel. I recently cooked pea soup in this stockpot on low heat for two hours and when I stirred the bottom the pea soup was scorched. If you are looking for a heavy duty stockpot this is not one I would recommend. Pay the extra money and get All-Clad.
5,The best singing book I own!,"What I like about this book is that its not the same old recycled information. I thought I had read everything on vocal health but Jamie has given me a new way to care for my voice.I usually wont buy a book if it doesn't have a 'Search Inside' option. I got this book purely because of the great reviews. I'm glad that I did.Even though this book doesn't come with cd's, Jamie more than made up for this by giving the reader access to the Members Only section of his website. Here you will find video lessons, a forum and exercises to accompany the book. I am very happy with this buy.Nadia"
2,Lots of product pitches,"I went through this book, it's pretty verbose, has lots of product pitches, and deals with a lot of other areas than just voice; I appreciate the ""holistic"" approach, but at the end I walked away from the book thinking it's 2 stars at best."
3,"Loved the book, hated the ""natural remedy"" influence","Chapters devoted to natural remedies??? You have got to be kidding me!Liked the book, liked the guy and the videos. But I cannot say that I liked the descriptions on all kinds of herbs and what it does to your body, etc. etc. etc.There are many methods to stay healthy and I want a book on singing, not staying healthy.Great focus on resonance, but I think that the book does a somewhat poor job on how to ""shoot into the soft palate"". When I would try using his method, the results were nasally and doing it otherwise gave it a throaty feel.I read this book over a year ago. My favorite book is the CVT by Cathrin Sadolin, but I think I will reread this book if I find time this summer from practice."
4,very good 'go to' book,Very helpful book! I now have a better sense of what to look for when going to antique/estate auctions. Also helped me estimate the age and style of a few pieces I already had.
4,Line 6 Rocks,"Bought this product a week ago and shipping was fast and on time. I like the use of this product and the playability. Very user friendly, even to new comers. I am a beginner and found it to easy to use."
4,Buen pedal de Expresion,"es un buen pedal de expresion , bastante satisfecho , es de mi hijo y el esta contento con el, solo el unico detalle que esta muy fragil mpor ser de plastico."
3,Fairly Solid For Plastic,"For a plastic pedal with some rubber to grip your foot on top of the pedal, it is decently made. Not as solid as your average pedal made from metal, but it will do. Definitely not as solid as the Line 6 M series it is made to be used with."
3,Does the job.,"This product does exactly what I want. It allows me to adjust effect parameters on the fly. I use 2 of these expression pedals with my Line6 M9. The build quality is not sub par, however it is not a durable steel chasis you can stand on. All in all if it were to break I would replace it with the same product. I would look at other product offerings if you are rough on your equipment or you are using it for Wah."
5,Working Good.,Pretty simple little device. No problems with this expression pedal. Works well with the HD500 Line 6 makes. Got 2 of them.
5,Great pedal,"This is a good pedal, i was a little concerned about what people said about it being made of plastic.This is a sturdy piece of equipment. As long as your not gonna back flip front kick on to it, it will last a long time , and as anything, mistreat it and it wont last. It is also very smooth and precise."
3,"Not that great, but you might like it","Of course it's only my opinion that this isn't the best anime I've seen. Your mileage may vary - your tastes necessarily don't equal mine.Anyways, here's my take on Shamanic Princess: First, let me define something here.""Shaman: A member of certain tribal societies who acts as a medium between the visible world and an invisible spirit world and who practices magic or sorcery for purposes of healing, divination, and control over natural events. - shamanic.""In other words, this is an anime about a princess that has powers over the this world and the paradimension.Although Shamanic Princess has some excellant animation and great dubbing, I found the storyline/action to be missing something. The effects were really good, but the anime itself couldn't hold my attention very much.The only thing I can say is you might have better luck with this anime. I didn't find it particularly interesting, but you might. My suggestion: give it a try, you never know."
5,I Luv Being Company To This Controversy,This is an amazing cd. If you are fans of Fall Out Boy then you'll love this band. You can feel their intensity through the music and I've had the privilage to seeing them live and it gets even better. Its upbeat and the whole cd goes seamlessly together. This is a album you can rock out to. Pick it up you won't regret it.
1,Incompatible,I could not use the product as it was coded for another country. Very embarassing for a Christmas gift. Clearly the site cannot be trusted.
1,WARNING TO NICK CAVE FANS,"If you think this little book has something to do with Nick Cave you are wrong. If you want the edition that has Nick's foreword, you have to get the U.K. edition by Canongate. amazon.com has this book linked incorrectly!"
1,Buy the British version !,For reasons of political and religious correctness the Americans have issued their own versions of these pocket books. The British ones are much better.
4,Stroke,"A fast read into the interesting world of women's profesional pool playing, a contrast to the world of ""The Hustler"". Written by someone who knows and appreciates the game."
5,Must-read for anyone playing Blackjack outside the US,"Zender is the most recognized expert on casino cheating in the world. His preface focuses on where you have to worry about cheating - mainly outside the US, or in small unregulated US casinos (if you play in Las Vegas or other large casinos, cheating is not a problem).The second area he focuses on is the methods casinos use to cheat, and how to detect them. I have played in casinos outside the US, and have personally seen casinos cheating (in Curacao). As a card-counter, I could have been financially wiped out if I played there unaware of what the casino did.This book is a quick read - it is entertaining with the antecdotes, but also includes good documentation on how to identify cheating, including illustrations. Another book to consider if you play many casino games is ""Casino Game Protection"" by Steve Forte."
2,Don't buy this version if you want to play online,"This is a great game, but this particular edition is not what you should buy if you want to play with others (LAN or Internet). Despite the product image, this is the Ubisoft gold edition, which has version mismatch problems with other gold editions. It will not auto update to the same version as the normal Thrones & Patriots, so if you try to join a game you will get an error saying you need something like version 07.25.00.15705, even though the in game versions match.There is a way around this which involves creating an ISO without the patch on the disc and using a No-CD executable, but it's a hassle and not worth it.If you're going to play by yourself, this edition is fine. If you want to play with friends, look elsewhere (unless they all have the Ubisoft edition)."
4,RN Gold Like it alot,Great game for begginers and old gamers alike. Easy to use and not a ton of commands.
1,Ubisoft version? Don't buy!,"I just want to support what Jeff B said about the Ubisoft version. I am having this exact issue when I play online. Either be sure to get the real ""Gold"" version or make sure that you and your friends all have the same version - all ubisoft or all gold.It is a real dissapointment since Rise of Nations is a fantastic game. It is going on 5 years, yet there is an avid player community out there. Never has a Civilization-like game been so customizeable and replayable. Love, love the game. Hate the version issue. Now, I need to find the right version so my brother and I can play together.Good luck."
1,This is the EUROPEAN version - don't buy it,"I have played RON for years. Recently, I uninstalled my game, then could not find the code to reregister. So, I ordered this copy. Ten bucks, easy peasy. Not! I can't get support from Microsoft because my new registration number is for the European version, and the Thrones and Patriots portion will not load. So, I'm out ten bucks and still have no game to play."
2,An Average Collection,"I had borrowed almost all of the available Carver short story collections but the sparse style does gets old fairly quickly - I enjoyed a few stories in ""Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?"" but can't quite give a full hearted recommendation. This is an average collection with some nice stories, but can be safely given a miss."
4,What if Carver had never met Gardner?,"Carver shines his flashlight into a recess too deep.We know what lurks there, but only Carver feels compelled to prod it repeatedly, until it viciously strikes back.I found the wounds worth it, however.I wear the scars proudly."
2,tears easily,"Used this to decorate a luau. As we were cutting out the shapes, the film kept tearing, causing us to have to discard almost half of it!"
2,Deathlands Meets Flipper,"In Deep Empire, Ryan and Co. jump to the Florida keys. There they discover Mark Tomwun, a scientist working at The Institute of Peaceful Oceanographic Research. The band of survilist soon discover that the work that Tomwun is doing is not all that peaceful. Tomwun is training dolphins to kill. Particularly pirates that have been threatening the Insistute. On top of the killer dolphins, and the threatening pirates, there is also the impending erruption of a volcano. All this ties together in a lackluster Deathlands story. There are some exploration in a plot B side story concerning Abe's search for the Trader, but only adds a teaser to the reunion of Ryan, JB, and the Trader later on in the series. The Abe/Trader side story almost seems like an after thought to try to beef up an anti-climatic story. I'd recommend this book only to a true fan of the Deathlands series, but to someone who is just beginging to read these fine books, I'd suggest passing on this adventure."
4,Technology and pulsating growth,"Dr. Perez makes the very solid points that technology revolutions impart a pulsating character to economic growth. A technology revolution forms the basis for an ""investment frenzy."" When this has run its course, the economy faces a number of unpleasant possibilities, including serious recession, depression, and stagflation. The presence or absence of a technology-inspired investment boom is a crucial determinant of what result will follow from a given policy action. However, the state of technology is almost always ignored by policymakers. This may be a case wherein the lack of an easy way to deal with a problem leads to ignoring it."
5,A great addition to your Richard Cheese collection,This is a great collection of Cheese-ified songs. Some Christmas classics as well as newer music are included. The letter from Santa printed inside the CD sleeve is a real laugh!
5,Il film più divertente che io abbia mai visto...,"This film is by far the funniest film I have ever seen. It could not be more entertaining. I could sit here and write about what happened in the film and try to explain why it was hilarious, but the truth is that it's something that simply needs to be experienced, you can't be told about it. All I can tell you, the movie watching public, to do is to see this movie in the original italian with subtitles. It is true that even if you don't understand italian, you need to hear Roberto's voice for it to work. Never get a dubbed copy of ANY of his films. The dubbing is always crap. He is the funniest man alive and this film showcases the best and the most purest version of his comedy of any of his work. It's over the top, yes, but it's splendid good fun and it'll put a smile on your face for hours after."
5,Bene bene bene!,FANTASTIC MOVIE!! I laughed until I cried! If you loved Life Is Beautiful or enjoy clever entertaining foreign films you will LOVE this movie!!
5,it helps if you understand a little bit of italian....,"or come from an italian family with all the baggage that comes along with that...however, the mere idea that so much could happen to one person and him just 'not getting' it is incredibly hilarious."
5,Don't miss this film!,"This is a great film that should not be missed. It is hilarious, touching, and just a pleasure to watch. If you saw Roberto Benigni at the Oscars or saw Life is Beautiful, then you got a glimpse of this naturally funny and tender actor. This is a full comedy and absolutely worth seeing with subtitles to get Roberto?s wonderful pater. Don?t go by the description of the plot. As lame as it would be in the US, it really is not in this film! Many foreign comedies don't translate well, but this does!"
3,Benigni A Couple Of Years Before His Star Rose,"Roberto Benigni, who went to achieve international stardom with ""Life Is Beautiful,"" plays two roles in this comedy. The story is about an innocent man who is dead ringer for a gangster-informant-in hiding. Benigni plays both roles.It's a decent movie, a low-key comedy that has some funny moments but would have been much better had it been chopped down about 15 minutes. It tends to drag a bit during the second half. Benigni, as the ""wimp,"" is a very charming guy and one that's easy to root for, but the rest of the characters in the film are just so-so. It's odd to see the usually high-strung Benigni as a lower-key person, but I like it.Surprisingly, this is an ""R"" rated comedy, and that's because of the language. I rented this once, but would see it again on a Region 1 DVD."
5,BENIGNI IS A COMIC GENIUS!,"i know what some of you might be thinking --- ""watch a comedy with subtitles? that sounds like too much hassle....""but believe me it's worth it! Benigni is hysterical! You are cheating yourself by not experiencing the freaking hilarity! This film is silly & slapsticky but also sweet & endearing. U'm really glad my friend from italy made me go see it in the theatre. I almost backed out, i'm so glad i didn't."
5,Don't Touch the Bananas in Palermo,"I think there are two major reasons to see this film. One is Roberto Benigni's eccentric parody of a Sicilian mafioso (""Mia Madre!""), which comes off as a wild contrast to Benigni's other character in the film who is ALMOST completely innocent and naive (innocent compared the mafioso). The other reason is Nicholetta Braschi's performance as the mafioso's wife, who has the tendency to steal every scene. This film is fun, fast-paced, and worth seeing, if only just to watch Roberto Benigni bounce off walls. It is also a good film for students of Italian, as the characters do not speak in warp speed."
2,"Unfortunately, I saw ""The Monster"", ""Night on Earth"" and","""Life is Beautiful"" first, in that order. ""The Monster"" made me laugh until it hurt, as did Benigni's segment in ""Night on Earth"". By comparison, ""Stecchino"" doesn't have the edge that the other two have. The one thing that Benigni does quite well in this movie is clearly establish the two separate characters he plays. You don't need a score card to keep track of who is who, and that's not something that every actor can pull off. But for sheer lunacy, this movie doesn't compare to ""Monster"" and ""Night"", and none of the three have the complexity of ""Life is Beautiful."""
1,No break away safety feature,It's been awhile since I've purchased a kitten collar. I guess I assumed that anyone who cares about kittens would have a break away feature. The stretchy elastic means that the collar is stuck in the kittens teeth shortly after putting it on. Not pretty when the collar won't break away. I would not recommend this collar. I would rate it less than 1 if I could.
2,beautiful but fragile,"This ring is just beautiful, works very well, but the stone popped out the 2nd time I wore it and I had to superglue it back on."
2,Disappointed,"As someone who has taken between 15 and 20 Microsoft/Novell exams, I was anxious to try Syngress. Now, having taking my 70-292 exam, I'm going to pitch the 70-296 book in favor of another publisher. In short, the 70-292 didn't address a number of things on the test. What things? Probably better not say due to the NDA. Even though I passed the test I was shocked at how much the test had that the book didn't prepare me for. Furthermore, the grammatical mistakes in the book were very apparent. A company that can't get most of the grammar taken care of in a book causes great concern to me. Grammar should be easy compared to the technical side. Lastly, I've found Syngress to be unresponsive to comments e-mailed from their web-site. Another mark against them. I can't recomend a replacement for this product, but I'll be looking for one, that's for sure."
3,"Good, but...","Very good, but very sweet. I actually like powdered version in one-serving packets that I found at Walmart."
1,terrible,"I purchase silk underwear because of the durability of silk. These were terrible. I purchased 2 pair and they both fell apart within 3 months. In my experience, Hom and Bruno Banini both last years. Don't waste your money."
3,Briefs,The briefs were too thin not what I expected.However I won't return them it would be too much trouble
1,Too thin not bad design,These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear.
4,Christmas present,My sister a librarian loved this book. I purchased it for Christmas for my grandchildren. Looking forward to their response.
3,Why the Chimes Rang remake,"I much prefer ""Why the Chimes Rang"" by Raymond Macdonald Alden as a Christmas classic with beautiful language (1909 original publish date, still being published). Seems like this is just a take off on that story with no mention of it. My 3 boys love Why the Chimes Rang. Try to find an illustrated version."
4,In the true spirit of the Winter holidays.,This is a lovely book written about the true meaning at the heart of most of our Winter holidays. It refers to Christmas but the moral is that of giving of oneself & putting others & what is right first. I work at a Unitarian Universalist Church & was pleased to read this to our students as the symbolism of the torch lighting is reminiscent of our flaming chalice.
4,Light of Christmas,Very good book. If my hyper active 5 year old grand daughter was still long enough to listen to the book. It had to be a good book. I actually enjoyed it myself.
4,Small but good starting point,On time and as described. Very Good. Excellent for beginners or those that want a little information about Gaelic .
5,The book is nearly as large as the ship itself!,"I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the huge box awaiting me on my porch. Upon opening the box my eyes met a wonderful sight, Four majestic B-36s in formation over the whitehouse. I was not dissapointed at the contents of the book itself. I especially like the accounts of those who served with this monster (very few of which are negative concerning their experience) I would recomend this book for any aviation library, the 36 definitely deserves a spot in one, it is a shame that it has been practically forgetten. The section on the experimental versions was also well done, my only gripe is the lack of a picture of the flight deck of the NB-36."
2,Disappointed,"Item arrived with a 3inch scratch across the screen. The USB port is only accessable from your camera not your computer (male connection), which if you read closer in the less than sufficient instructions it does state. (USB device support - Thumb Drive, card reader, camera). Media type wasn't compatable with my camera (Smart Media) which it also states in small print - Media Type - SD/MMC/MS/XD. Screen size is small at 5.6"".Over all I was disapponted with the product. Quality control seems to be an issue. Seeing that you can get a portable DVD player for $150 with a bigger screen, at $99 this seems to be overpriced. Would wait for the price to come down. Wouldn't pay more than about $59 for this product."
2,Inexpensive and hardly worth it.,"bought this for my grandparents and will probably give it to them. overall the picture quality is pretty awful, the instructions are a joke and unit emits alot of heat so i'm not sure how durable it's going to be. i would purchase a different unit next time.i too have a problem with my MAC photos. i find that if I save them down to an extremely small size (like a thumbnail) then the unit will pick them up. otherwise i just get a black screen with an x.all this offset by a terrific price. but even so it's not worth it."
1,Mediocre at best,"Have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid. Instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error. After getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the Sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance. Not at all like what I have seen in other digital picture frames. Just arrived from Amazon and intended as a V-Day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess I better make a dash to the florist."
4,Great gift,"Bought 4 of these for gifts at Christmas and everybody who received it has been thanking me for purchasing them. It is easy to set up, and with the screen effects makes it fun just to watch the pictures scroll by. Would recommend this product."
1,Don't waste your money,This product only worked for a couple of months before it fried and wouldn't display anything. I called the manufacturer and got an RMA number and returned it to them. They replaced it with one that crapped out again after a short time! It's a waste of time and money.
3,Victoria,"The product was a Christmas gift for my father and sister-in-law. It would have been nice if there had been better instructions on how to use the frame, not everyone if a techey."
2,"Cute, but any above-average computer user will be dissatisfied","The frame itself is attractive and sleek, but that's where the beauty of the device ends. Looking at the images actually hurts a little bit, as the images are grainy and there is a noticeable ghosting effect. Some of the colors appear in off-colors and it seems like the lcd display is of a lower quality. Bright images have a nasty glowing effect that slightly washes the image. The low resolution of the image is distinct. I'm sure my mother will love it but I could never use it, as I use computers frequently and the poor image quality causes physical pain to my eyes."
1,Not entirely what I expected,1 - It is entirely to fragile. Within 3 hours of coming out of the box the back of the picture frame that is like a kick stand for the frame broke as it is only plastic.2 - Expected the resolution to be better then what it was. Have a 10 megapixel camera and the resolution for the frame is way to low.3 - I am computer savvy and know what to do only from experience. Other people who have no idea like my 86 year old grandfather would have no clue what to do as the instructions are not adequate enough.To conclude...save your money...there are better frames out there and I almost would want to send the frame back to get mine back but its already out of the package and although the frame was broke as a result of an accident that would not have broke a regular frame...it is still broke and doubt will be able to get money back for it.
3,Needs Improvement,"I received this digital picture frame for a Christmas gift. The concept is great but this particular frame needs improvement. Once I figured out how to load the pictures (directions are awful & you need to supply the external memory), the frame was great. But only for about 10 minutes. As stated in another review, the frame gets very hot. Once it warmed up, I noticed my photos getting a green tint to them. The longer I left the unit on, the more colors I got. After about 15 minutes, people had rainbow colored faces and clothes. It was awful. I sent the unit back thinking it was a defect in mine, however, after reading these reviews I believe it is this model. I will purchase another frame, but a different make."
2,Digital Picture Frame,"This item was purchased as a gift for Mom. Overall I was not happy with the product because it didn't meet my expectations. The main reason that I didn't like it was because it didn't work properly with the memory card. It kept on skipping and had trouble recognizing the card. It worked better with a memory stick. Ultimately, I had to return the item and was very satisfied with Amazon's return policy. When I set the frame up for my Mom and saw that there were problems with it, I was concerned that returninig it would be a hassle. I was pleasantly surprised. Amazon made the return process stress-free. I was also dissatisifed with the size of the displayed images on the frame. I didn't realize how small they would appear."
5,Memory Frame,I love it. It is easy to use and the pictures look great. Gave one to my Mother in law for her birthday and she has no problem using it either. The SD cards are great so you can have any size memory and the card reader that came with it are so useful and time saver. The frame looks so nice with the ability to change it with any other frame of that size. Love that I could put video or music on the cards also and use the frame to play them. Good Price for a very good product! Thanks!
2,not too bright,You get what you paid for...this product is very cheap and it does not do a good job of displaying photos. Too dim.
1,Short term memories ?,"I bought this at Christmas 2006 as a present for my wife. Great present, well received and a wonderful way to view pictures and remind us of when they were taken ....... but it only lasted 5 months. By May 2007 it packed up and wouldn't play any more pictures. Replaced the memory card but to no avail ..... not worth the money for five months."
1,Don't keep on 24/7 ... the pixels go out!!,This frame looked very nice after it was first purchased however after two weeks the pixels started to go out. After 3 weeks it looked like it was snowing in every picture. I called the company 2x but never got a call back. I'm looking for a new model now.
4,good value.,"The unit works fine. Easy to set up. photos are a bit grainy, not very high resolution. Stand back and look at them from a couple feet away and they look acceptable. Gave it as a gift to my parents, loaded with a bunch of family photos."
4,"No documentation, but a good value","Took me a few to figure out how to use this since the documentation is basically non-existent. I did notice several comments that you can't play pictures and music at the same time, but you can. The processing capability isn't up to handling high-quality music and pictures at the same time, but if you reduce the MP3 bitrate, it'll work. I just re-encoded some of my music for 96kbps & mono, and it worked just fine. Don't expect the music quality to be fantastic, but frankly, the speakers in this frame aren't going to be up to playing high-quality music anyways.For the price, this is a great frame with good capabilities. -1 star for the documentation."
4,VEry good but could have been better,"This is a good pretty frame for displaying your digital picture, but there is two big things I would fix. Brightness. It would have been nice to control the brightness level. Also the FRame gets a little warm. It wold be nice to have a timer."
2,Should be better,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend and was very disappointed with it. I am sending it back. If you want to use one memory card per photo session, then fine. Otherwise, there should be a capacity for transfering photos from your computer or camera onto the frame without tying up the memory card or having to have it plugged into the camera or computer. BTW, the frame is the size mentioned, but the actual LCD screen is much smaller and the resolution is grainy. The manual that comes with it is severely lacking, regardless of whether or not you have computer knowledge. I will say that it is extremely easy to just plug the memory card into the frame, and let it rip, but again, if you like to reuse your memory card and download photos onto the computer, this is not the purchase for you. It should be priced much less, for the little it offers."
2,Quality not what I expected.,"The digital quailty is very good but, the housing looks very cheap for the asking price. I can see why the price was cut. Even with the price cut it was still not worth it. It the housing was made of hard plastic. It might be but... it is made of low grade plastic. Even the stand doesn't seem sufficient enough to support the weight of the frame. I would expect that over time the frame would start collapsing under the weight. At most I wouldn't pay any more than 30.00 for it"
1,disappointing,"Bought this for my parents as a gift, instructions are worthless,hard to fit memory stick in unit, two days after using it it began to tick like a clock and then suddenly stopped working! Thought it was going to explode. It is being shipped back for a refund!"
1,"This ""new"" picture frame was full of scratches and finger prints","The digital picture frame was purchased as ""new."" This was going to be a christmas gift for my wife. I intended on displaying pictures of the children on Christmas morning. When I opened the package there were finger prints, smudges and scratches all over the screen. The accessories were haphazardly placed in the box and the box was not sealed. This item had clearly been used. I have puchased 100's of items from Amazon and this purchase was by far the most disappointing."
1,didn't receive,i never received this item as amazon cancelled my order...please make sure that i was credited for the cancellation...
2,Cool Idea but Resolution Isn't That Great,"This is a great gift idea and the product works well. Unfortunately the pictures wash out a bit since the screen doesn't have very high resolution. With the right pictures - mainly close-up shots - you'll be OK.Instructions, even though you'll think you won't need them, are useless so plan to spend a few extra minutes working out the settings."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am sorely disappointed with this product. It states that you can use a Memorystick or USB device. I have been unable to use either. The only thing that will work is the SD from my wife's Palm. The instructions are grossly inadequate which should say alot, since this product should not need any instructions. Also, I thought I had a bonus when I found a USB drive contained in the box, but incredibly it would not work on my Dell computer. I have several Memorysticks that I use with my Sony cyber-shot camera, but now I'm stuck going out to buy a SD card, just for this device. Please look elsewhere before you buy."
3,OKAY,A NICE PRODUTS BUT PICTURE IS SMALLER THEN IT LOOKS ON THE PICTUREBUT STILL A NICE PRODUTS FOR THE PRICE
1,very poor product,Instructions are worthless; even after obtaining information from Tech support the product does not work. I am likely to return the product.
1,Useless,"The title describes it best. I hope my son is not reading the review, he gave to me as a christmas present"
2,Grainy Photos,I have a digital picture frame already and order this one as a present for a family member thinking I would get the same quality of pictures for a much less price that what I paid for my original digital frame. The pictures on this Spectrum turned out very grainy and they look like they were on a cheap photo frame. I returned the one I purchased because I was so disappointed.
3,Digital Spectrum Memory Frame MF-575 5.6 Inch frame,"This is a great item and functions well, however, it does not come with a memory card. That must be purchased separately and the images are grainy and a bit blurry. It is still a good gift item but falls short on the satisfaction scale."
3,Poor picture quality and unfriendly interface,The color of the pictures shown was washed out. The interface is hard to operate and portrait photos are not turned correctly for viewing.
1,"Another ""Joey"" Dissapointment !!",Not sure what all the hype is about with Joey New York???? Purchased 2 products and have been completely disappointed with both. They promise to give temporary help to those of us that are wrinkle ridden and certainly do not deliver. The only thing I can say to the defense of this product is that it does make your skin feel soft but don't even attempt to use it prior to your foundation. All it will do is make your foundation ball up and roll right off. Save your Money for your next Botox Session !!!
3,Gardening With Guineas,"A useable guide for those with no experience in raising guineafowl, but with experience, the methods Mrs. Ferguson advises are sometimes called into question. The main premise of her book is that guineas co-habitate with her gardens and do no damage. This is not an absolute and those acquiring guineafowl to control weeds and insect pests will be disappointed if not misled. The book is readable and does have some useful information so the price is not a bad investment."
3,"O.k., but not great","I purchased this book in preparation for raising some guinea keets I received from a friend. As a gardener, I was particularly interested in their function as an ""organic insecticide"".The information was sufficient, but not well-written or proof-read, more like a newspaper article. Not enough focus on the gardening aspect, other than that they like certain bugs that harm flowers and veggies. The taming process described is impossible to achieve if you have other things to do than playing with the birds. It is not necessary to keep them caged in the chicken coop for 6 weeks - mine are roaming the chicken yard at 6 weeks old with a bantam hen that adopted them. They stick very close to the coop.All the information presented can be found on the internet without having to shell out almost 15 bucks."
2,Basic starter book,Although I find this to be a good starter book it is a bit set in the author's thoughts on how to raise guineas. The girl appears to be learning as she writes. Experience will show many different and at times better ways to raise these wonderful birds. Consider that this is only one person's opinions.
2,Perhaps better than nothing.,"I have had my guinea fowl for more than a year now. Almost nothing in this book is true. I would start with other resources first. The only thing true and very worthy to know in this book is that guineas like white prosso millet.Only one thing was more disappointing than this book - Stromberg's (the company where I bought my guineas by mail). I waited over two months without communication, stayed home from from vacation because they told me on the phone my order would be coming, and I could never get information that my order would be be delivered in late July instead of the first of May.Two GARDENING WITH GUINEAS facts that I found to be untrue are: 1) Guineas do not dig the ground (Guineas completely denude their pen.); and 2) Guineas do not eat plants, just the bugs off the plants (Guineas have defoliated entire trees, shrubs, as well as potted plants on my property.).Other erroneous information includes information about dogs and guineas."
5,raising guineas,There are two things to comment on here-1/an excellent book for the beginner or an experienced bird person-highly recommend2/The delivery time was much shorter than I expected-much appreciated
4,Short but sweet,"Maybe there just isn't that much to say about guineas - though from what I've read so far, the author says it in a fun and easy to read way. My only complaint is that for a cover price of $15, I sure expected something bigger than an oversized booklet."
4,Fun Book,"This book is quite comprehensive, although not very long, and should be read by all who are even considering starting with guineas; however, I have one complaint, and this is just something that bothers me tremendously, a pet peeve, really. In numerous places throughout the book, Ms. Ferguson uses the word 'site' when she means 'sight' as in ""site for sore eyes"". This happens so many times, I was beginning to wonder if any proofreading actually took place. Other than that, I loved the book and reread it often."
4,my handbook,"When my husband told me he had ordered 20 guinea chicks, I had a moment of panic. After reading this book, which gives detailed instructions for different stages of raising guinea fowl, I feel securely armed with many chapters of the author's experience. Our keets are a week old now, and doing fine!"
5,Fun subject mater book,Gardening with guineas was fun to read and has a lot of perspective on guinea fowl. My son and daughter are also going to reed it then we will vote on starting the new venture of raising guineas.
1,Disappointed Reader,"This short book may be of limited help to those who know nothing about guinea fowl or poultry. It seems to be from an inexperienced, new to the species viewpoint. The information is presented as facts from which the keeper of guineas should not stray. However, much of the information is questionable and none of it is referenced. It reads like a housewife's tale of her personal experience starting with guineas complete with pictures of the entire family. It is also not easy to use or reference as the book doesn't even have an index. I would recommend more authoritative, general guides for raising and keeping birds."
4,Enthusiastic and helpful,"This easy-to-read book answered most of my questions about guinea fowl, presenting both the benefits and the difficulties with fairness. The author's enthusiasm for guinea fowl was infectious, but she still managed to present a fairly objective look at the subject. As multiple cats share my residence, I was worried about whether or not guinea fowl would be safe here; the author reassured me on that subject so thoroughly that I began to wonder if my cats would be safe! As a Canadian, I would have appreciated some references to Canadian sources. The book was worth the price."
4,Very Nice Book,This book is great for the beginer and someone who already has the birds.Even though I have had Guineas for a year I still picked up some great ideas.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book with great expectations based upon the glowing reviews of others. Though a decent source of information about raising guineas, the book often left me frustrated and confused. For example, contrary to Ms. Ferguson's experience, neither I nor anyone I've talked to has had any success moving guinea nests. Also, when discussing raising young keets, the author states, ""it would be a good idea to provide an optional heat source for the keets in the henhouse on really cold days or nights until they are older."" What is ""really cold"" and what is ""older""? On numerous occasions I've searched this book for help with specific problems and gotten only vague information that left the question unanswered.My experience has taught me, 1. Guineas can be raised exactly like chickens and 2. Don't try to move a guinea nest. Just invert a cage on top of the setting hen, give her food and water, and let her hatch and raise her brood right there."
3,Fiesta 18 Oz bowls,"Shipped quickly and received with no problems. I like the white and the bowls are decent sized. Surprised, though, to see dark marks in glaze from spoons after only using and washing a couple of times! Makes me wonder what the company is doing different when it comes to manufacturing."
3,Jumbo?,Purchased this bowl for my daughter fo Christmas. I assumed jumbo meant that it was a large bowl as in serving bowl size. It was not so I returned it. Nice bowl...just not what I expected.
3,Great Cookbook,"I was very pleased when my book arrived. It was in good condition and appeared in good condition. I was replacing my original copy of this cookbook, which was pretty much trashed, so it was great to be able to ""start again"" fresh !"
4,Good receipes for dinner parties,Fun and easy receipes for dinner parties. The enchalada verdes is especially good.
4,THE BEST OF THE BLAXPLOITATION FILMS,"PERHAPS THE BEST BLAXPLOITATION FILM OF THEM ALL. JOHN SHAFT [RICHARD ROUNDTREE] IS HIRED TO INVESTIGATE THE KIDNAPPING OF A GANG LORD'S DAUGHTER. VERY INTERESTING MOVIE WIH LOTS OF GREAT MUSIC. THE FILM ALSO HAS A SHARP SENSE OF HUMOR. FOR A FUN TIME, CHECK OUT THIS CLASSIC 1971 ACTIONER. ISSAC HAYES WON AN OSCAR FOR THE SHAFT THEME SONG. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS, A TV SERIES, AND WAS REMADE [SORT OF] IN 2000."
2,"Video Transfer is OK, the audio is spotty and not so hot",The video Transfer was ok. The Audio was not so good. The sound dropped in volume at time in the DVD.The behind the scenes extra is very good.The Sound Track of Shaft does a much better job with his theme then the movie does.I would pass on this one. The quality isn't there.
5,THIS WAS A GIFT,"Gave this to my cousin, who has always been a Shaft fan. He loved all three movies and watched them while traveling."
4,"When a film starts a new genre, it's a star","I won't repeat all the praise for this film, whose technical weaknesses owing to budget problems are almost the only thing preventing a 5-star rating.But here's a mystery - how did this film get into a 100 Best Gay Films list? A legpull?"
5,Cool Music,"Shaft DVDAs far as I know Shaft broke new ground as a movie starring a black man in 1971. Shaft was the perfect example of a rogue cop, taking orders from no one and tracking down the crooks no matter where they hid in the city.Recommended for fans of Richard Roundtree and quality jazz.Gunner February, 2008"
2,Pan & Scan,"Just a note to buyers:All three SHAFT films presented as this triple feature are NOT the widescreen versions. Case cover lists them as ""Full Frame."""
5,Shaft is one bad Mo-Fo.....Can you dig it baby?,"Shaft is by far the best of the 70's black ""Pimpin bad dude"" type films. John Shaft is one bad Mo-Fo, he gets the girls, the money, and always gets away from the law. Besides, who else has threads as fresh as Shaft! I would most definetly recommend this movie, especially to anyone who is a fan of the 70's. Lets hope that the remake rekindles some interest in all things ""Shaft""."
3,"Great movie, Bad audio","You know, if you're going to release this excellent trilogy on DVD, the least you could do is insure it's audio excellence. The movies are still excellent, but what a disappointment to listen to. The movie itself gets 5 stars, but this release should've been handled better."
5,A Hollywood Classic,The plot has holes and the directing and editing is choppy but on the whole this is a great film. A true breakthrough that affected both black and white films that came later.
3,"Great Flick, Horrible Video Copy!","Shaft is without a classic film of the blaxploitation genre, and its a shame to have this video sound the way it does. At the begining Shaft's voice sounds dubbed! You can see his lips move but the voice sounds too clear to be coming from a streetcorner in NYC. So, if things like these don't bother you. The rest of the film is ok!"
5,John Shaft is a mack!,"This cat is one bad motha.. Shutcho mouth! Shaft is the flyest, mackinest, coolest detective this side of New York City. A big 5 stars, this is one of the best movies ever created, right up there with Wild Style, props to Richard Roundtree."
5,a classic,one of the first black action heroes.very timely and a classic soundtrack by issac hayes.the film is still solid after all of these years.it's a must see.
2,This Shaft Shafts You,"Besides the poor quality, the movie is edited. Shaft's vulgar language is one of the best parts of the movie, and you are stuck with Roundtree's dubbed over voice every time he yells at someone. A REAL disappointment."
3,Also look at the 2800,"We found these didn't offer as much value as the 2800 Intellifax models. They're big and bulky, it's hard to read the display unless you have it on a 28"" or lower counter. For all the size, it doesn't hold a ton of paper and doesn't offer a huge advantage over the 2800. They don't seem to last that much longer either."
4,Brother Intellifax,"Have the identical machine as we require multiple fax sttations in our office. This machine is a workhorse, processing hundreds of pages per day. One important note is that using remanufactured drums may cause significant issues. We use the remanufactured toner, but using the drums ended up causing the machine to make a terrible grinding noise. Replacing it with a genuine Brother drum was all it needed to run well."
5,Brother 4100e fax,There is no comparison - This is the easiest and best fax machine I have ever used.
5,Absolutely Bulletproof,"After buying a very expensive (and slow and useless) Canon fax machine, we decided to go against the Canon salesman's advice. We went to Staples and bought the Brother Intellifax 4100. BEST BUSINESS FAX MACHINE EVER. It has a large sheet tray and has gone for years of daily use without any breakdown whatsoever. Yes, we have to change the drum every year or two, but it is an easy operation and a small price to pay for a fast and reliable fax machine. Don't hesitate to buy this machine for your home or office."
1,Not compatible!!!,"I have no idea how well this product works, because it's not compatible with digital ISP phone lines, so it never worked for us. Nowhere in the item description does it explain that Brother machines are ONLY compatible with ANALOG lines. The tech support representative at Brother explained that NO Brother machine is compatible with digital lines. Please be aware when you consider this time!!"
1,"We have many, all with dead scanners","We have many of these units at my workplaces, and the scanners keep dieing. They are moderate to heavy used, but there is no reason the electronic scanner with no moving parts should fail so quickly and so often."
5,What a NICE Brother,"I bought this as a gift for my brother. I have an older model which has been great for me for three years. I trust the Brother products and will always consider them when shopping for faxes, copiers, etc."
5,Fax,"works perfect, no problems. easy to setup. very clear print. receive the machine in a very short period of time."
5,Brother Fax Machine and Toner,So far the fax machine has been an improvement over our previous Brother fax. The old one needed a new drum and it was cheaper in the long run to buy a new one.
5,Excellent value,My new Brother IntelliFax 4100E was very easy to install and setup. Easy to follow step by step instructions had me up and running in about 15 minutes. Fax and print quality are excellent. I highly recommend this product to any individual or small business that requires high speed and high quality fax and copy capabilities.
5,Great fax at good price,I am a purchasing agent that buys for 8 entities. this is a good machine at a resonable price for a medium size company.
5,"Solid machine, works great.","When I needed a FAX machine I did a lot of research and noticed that this machine received very positive reviews, so I ordered one. This machine is definitely worthy of the positive reviews it receives. Very solid machine and works flawlessly."
5,GREAT FAX MACHINE,Beautiful fax printouts with less expensive toner needs than the HP products that I was previously using.
4,Ok,"Pretty simple to set up and operate. A good replacement for our all-in-one.The only issue so far was that it can't take more than 20 digit phone numbers for preset buttons. Most calls to EU are up to 18 digits with pauses and if you are in an office environment that requires a passcode for long distance, you can't set up one button dialing. It has to be done with 2 buttons which is awkward. Otherwise a dependable machine so far."
2,CAUTION---This is not a wireless device!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just an FYI, although Brother lists this as a ""printer,"" be aware that it is not wireless capable. It can only be used as a wired printer."
1,RCR Report,The fax machine is defectived and damaged. I tried multiple times to make it wotk and it doesn't. A lot issues with several operations. It is just a piece of the equipment in very bad shape. Nothing like shown in the advertisement
1,SMART FRAUD. BROKEN PER FAX EXPERT. NEVER USE,This is one of the most reliable and solid fax machines around. AS LONG AS NOT SOLD WITH KEY IMPORTANT PART BROKEN.THEY SOLD IT BROKEN BASED ON TOP FAX REPAIR EXPERT.
3,A good reference,I thought that this was a pretty well done book. I suspect that there was a certain amount of guessing going on since there was no way to know for sure some of the info presented.
1,utterly vapid,"One hit wonder, the rest is utter trash. Uninspired 80's music. If this is the best, I'd hate to see what the rest is like."
2,Leaving Me Now.,"I was hoping this album would have the long version of Leaving Me Now. It did not, I was disappointed. Wish I could find this beautiful song."
2,"Sorry to be a hater, but...","I bought this thinking the songs might be almost as good as the wonderful 80's classic ""Something About You"". Mistake. The songs are generic, bland, very dated sounding lite jazz/funk/pop. Hated it, to be honest. ""Something About you"" is an absolutely essential track for any 80's aficionado, but if you are thinking of purchasing this you might want to consider that there may be a reason why they only had one hit. For comparison purposes, I got the brilliant, wonderful (and consistently enjoyable) The Very Best of Crowded House at the same time, and the difference is night and day."
4,"Excellent collection from a great band, but one major flaw -","This is a very satisfying collection from one of the best bands of the 1980's, but why is the version of Something About You (which I consider too be the pinnacle of their career) the 45 version? Unfortunately this cuts down the opening & the ending enough to where if you're a humongous fan of the song like I am it's drastic!Otherwise this a great collection, but if you NEED the long version like I do you'll have to get World Machine, which is a good album as well."
2,Grim ...,"The movie is pretty grim. It is a disjointed collection of three short stories. The transition from one story to another is abrupt and confusing. This is more of a documentary feature than a feature film.Some reviews talk about exotic locations and haunting cinematography. I think the movie scored poorly from an aesthetic perspective as well. A panoramic shot of the Judean desert doesn't exactly qualify as hypnotic. Another movie called ""The Beast of war"" was shot in the Judean desert and even though it was a raging war movie, the exquisite cinematography captured the viewer's attention.The only redeeming factor about this movie is that it isn't biased. Everybody (the Bedouins and the more upscale urban Israelis) have been measured on an equal scale."
1,fading already,"I applied this over a week ago, and I still have pink dye coming out of my hair, on towels, pillow cases, clothes..... I have never had this happen for longer than a day or two with any hair dye.I love the bright color, but it is already starting to fade (after only 8 days). I do use a sulfate-free shampoo, so I'm not exactly sure how other people are able to keep this color fade-free, but mine's not only fading, but rubbing all over the place.It also turned out really uneven. I haven't dyed my hair in years, so that is probably my fault.Unfortunately, the red I used to use has been discontinued; although I love the results that this color had right away, the quick fade and pink dye that is now rubbed all over my house is NOT worth it!!!!"
5,Love this color!,"It is very hard to find this color in stores -- I don't know it is because it is so popular or if L'Oreal is thinking about phasing it out (I hope not!), but I am grateful and happy that I can get it here, at a reasonable price, with fast delivery. Thank you!"
2,Not the Best...,I have naturally dark brown hair but had my hair highlighted blonde on the top. When I decided to cover it I went w/ this color/brand because L'oreal is known to have generally good products and the color on the box was similar to my natural color. Unfortunately within days of dying my hair the color drastically faded. :/ I colored it again and it looked nice for a couple days then started to fade. I use salon shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair AND my hair has never faded like this. Also this color is said to be a neutral. It is not. I have lots of brassy undertones pulling through and even at my roots (which were dark brown) the color showed up w/ lots of red. I suggest purchasing a different product.
2,ended up mahogony,"I had my blonde hair colored light brown with reddish highlights about 5 months ago, my hair needed freshening so I got the feria medium golden brown with multi-facited hightlights. Hellllllllp. My hair is now a deep dark mahogony. I don't know what to do to get this color lightened up, Hair looks the same shade as my china cabinet and with no highlights much less multifaceted or shimmering. And yes I followed the directions to the tee."
3,hair color,When I received my color it came opened with some of the product missing and broken. Product RSS useable only because I purchased two.
1,crap!,"ok the first box i got i was so excited, i used it, it colored nothing, waste of time and money.amazon sent me a second box i had to pay for, i couldnt return it, thanx amazon!"
1,Horrible,0 star. Take it off market. Wish they would pay for me to get my hair fixed. Turned orange/ strawberry blonde.
5,How To Maintain Red Hair,"Feria #77 is a fabulous color. Very rich and dramatic. If you're shy, retiring or prefer to blend in, this is NOT the color for you! This is a relatively new shade; actually I have a hard time finding it but Amazon usually has it and somebody is usually selling it much cheaper than Ulta or any upscale beauty supply place. The color is very dramatic. I'm a natural very dark brunette but have been a redhead for over 30 years. Here's my tip to maintain your shade regardless of which red you are. Red is the most difficult to maintain because of it's rapid fire fading. When you shampoo, only shampoo your scalp. Your hair is very seldom oily or dirty; it's your scalp that needs attention. Rise well and follow with as much cold water as you can bare. This will keep your color intact longer and leave you with added shine. If you condition try to rinse with cold water. Its tough in the winter but what price great looking hair?"
2,I think the product I recieved was old,"I recieved this and put it in my hair, the color turned out really odd, and the conditioner that came with this was gritty and didn't really condition. It looked so odd I had to go to a stylist to get the color evened out. I have used bottle color before and have never had this happen."
4,Copper Shimmer 74,"I love the color in Copper Shimmer 74, it suits my personality, and I also have many, many compliments from females and males, both young and old. What female doesn,t like compliments."
2,color didn't last,"I read the reviews on this item and purchased some L'Oreal Feria Medium Brown on 12-16-12. I followed all of the directions exactly. The color looked good, then by the 5th day, it was faded almost as though I had never put the color on my hair. I could not believe it faded that quickly. Won't buy it again."
1,Completely misleading... BEWARE!,"Just tried this hair color... big mistake! My hair color is dark ash blonde naturally. I wanted to go a little lighter, while keeping it in the ""cooler"" tones. I selected this mix because it explicitly said- ""Cooler""- that it was supposed to minimized red, orange and gold tones. What a lie! My hair turned out bright yellow-orange. Completely unnatural and completely unsightly. I had to go to the salon the next day to get it corrected, and the stylist said that Feria products are particularly difficult to correct because there are metals in the products (which are also horrible for your health). She recommended using a different brand if I ever wanted to do it myself again. I have to agree with her."
1,I did not expect this color!!!,"I purchased Loreal Fiera R68 Ruby Rush in the past. I never had a tube of ""colour booster"" included before. (Loreal customer service insists it has always been in this color!)It was bright magenta in the bottle and my hair is now also bright magenta! Double the surprises- before I could fix it- I walked into a surprise birthday party- for ME!!! The guests were as shocked as I was!Customer service tried to point out all the things I may have done wrong, and then told me to use a light brown color over it. Great... I'll just leave it to the professionals from now on.LOreal Feria Power Reds Hair Color - #R68 Ruby Rush (Rich Auburn True Red) - 1 EA"
1,Midnight Ruby... isn't.,"So frustrated. I chose this color and brand based on the reviews and the picture on the box, but my experience was very different. The color didn't take on most of my hair, except the back half of the top! (Which makes no sense at all. I haven't dyed or highlighted my hair in about 2 years.) So the back half of the top of my head is reddish, and the rest of my hair remains a slightly lighter shade of brown than it usually is. It's not at all flattering, looks very fake due to the unnaturally reddish section on top, and didn't make my hair shiny or soft. Now I get to go to a professional to try to fix this, and damage my hair some more."
2,One out of 3 products satisfactory,"I ordered 3 identical items. When they arrived I thought the boxes looked rough but the tape at the top of the box appeared still intact. The first box was used immediately and was exactly what I expected. About 6 weeks later I opened the 2nd box for use and realized it was missing necessary parts and was useless. Checking the last box it was evident that it had been opened and re-packaged with parts missing-also useless. So, in effect, I got 1/3 of my order. I have since learned that the product is no longer produced. My complaint is: if you don't have the complete product don't sell it! I think my complaint should be with Amazon and not Loreal, but I am not certain. Loreal should let consumers when a product has been discontinued."
5,"Very practical,as the title suggests","This is a great book for those who want to improve their endgameUnless you have the time and money to spend on something like `Basic chess endings'( by Reuben Fine),or you are a master,you should buy this."
2,Useful As A Reference For The Endgame Fanatic,"Even now, as a 2089 rated player, I still do not care for this encyclopedia of endgames. It definitely makes endgames seem dry, dull and incredibly difficult. Not for novices. If you can find Silman's interesting and educating ""Essential Chess Endgames,"" try that instead. I had the misfortune, ten years ago when I learned the game, of having only this to study endgames. I've only recently gotten over my dislike of endgames. Good luck getting much practical use out of this textbook."
1,pseudo science and fraud,"The day that Morris can get an article published in the Journal of Science or similar publication he will diserve an appology. Until then he should appologize to the scientific community for his misrepresentations, out right lies and fraud"
3,average,nice case protects your htc desire. i like the swivel strap on that comes with it but just one draw back. its a bulky to carry around. it made me forget how small my htc desire was because it made it look so large.
3,practical case,"I recently bought this case and it is really practical, nice belt holder. But i seem to lose signal with it and my in call volume is pretty low since my ear is a little farther from my phone."
5,yes yes,"introduced to these idea in university. We are hit by so many media texts, with the illusion that they are truth, that deny their origins. In this way it is a empowering book for the disenfranchised. It offers tools a means in which you can challenge the established order, nothing was ever written in stone."
