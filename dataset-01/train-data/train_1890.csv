5,Don't listen to crap: listen to Local H,"get this album and see what true, unadulterated rock n roll issupposed to be like. END"
4,Great two man racket,"Have listened to all the Local H CDs and found this one to be the best of the bunch. I really liked the mixture of melodic noisy ravers (the first two tracks) and slower, thoughtful stuff (the last track). There are a few tracks meant just to take up space, but they are fairly short. Sure, they sound a bit like Nirvana, but that doesn't take away the spirit of this CD. Get it if you like a Cheap Trick/Nirvana melodic noisefest."
4,Really Good 4 stars because I have not listened to it enough,"This CD is so good. I bought it for just one song ""All the kids are right"". Then I listened to it the whole way through and it is great. If you like all the kids are right I can't guarantee that you'll like this CD. If you like really good music then you'll love it."
5,Can't stop listening...over and over and over.,"This local grunge band from Zion Illinois has come a long way since their early days. Solid guitar work, catchy hooks, heavy tunes and typical rock n roll subject matter. Nirvana influence is evident, as is the almost Beetlesque arrangement on many of these tunes. A must have."
3,Weak Follow-Up,"This album has some great individual songs on it, but it's just nowhere near as cutting or emotional as the last record. This is a kinder, gentler Local H, no longer afraid of experimenting with more diverse kinds of songs but without the fury to back it up. Still well worth the time of any fan of the band."
2,Not that Great,Sorry guys but I have played this cd several times and it just don't do it for me. There is one really great song on it but the rest of it is just not my cup of tea.
4,Fun mix of electronics and acoustic instruments,"First off, let me say that the main reason I am writing this review is to provide a balance for the extremely negative (and misleading) review I noticed on this page. First of all, this is not a ""songtrack"", so if you are looking for Disney songs, this is definitely not for you. On the other hand, if you like playful orchestral music, with some electronic instruments and rock riffs in the mix, you will enjoy it. Richard Gibbs has tremendous talent, and the music fitst the film to a tee. As a listening experience it is somewhere between an instrumental rock album and an orchestral underscore.It is by no means ""crappy"". It deserves 4 out of 5 stars."
1,A total FFFFFF. The worst CD I have ever owned!,"Shame on the folks at Disney for making such a CRAPPY CD! I have a huge collection of children's CDs and by far, hands down, this on is the WORST! It has the 90s hit ""I'm too sexy for my..."" song on it, but you can probably find that is some 1990s collection. Half of this CD is cats hissing and clawing sounds. It is so f-n bad. I was going to donate it to goodwill just to get it out of my collection, but I spared the people at GW and pitched it instead. I like almost every kind of music, but folks, this is complete GARBAGE! Buy the DOG SONGS CD instead, if your looking for fun songs. It deserves negative stars. Putting 1 star is wrong!"
2,fans work but nothing else,"If you are looking at this item, it is obvious that you would like a fan that offers USB ports. Well this is not your product. I bought it for the same reasons. I went through every cooling pad that amazon offered and Thanks to the half a page false review of some genious customer I was convinced this thing was IT. Low and behold the USB ports shorted out the first hour I had it, and now its just an expensive cooling pad. If you want it for a cooling pad, I guess its not bad, Im sure you can do better for the price, as for USB, forget it. Besides, the portals are very week on the USB side. There would be no way these ports can handle in and out use. My SD does work, I just don't use it enough to see if works on a regular basis."
2,Please include solutions.,"Yes, I agree with the ""reader from RTP, NC"". A technical book with no solutions is worth nothing. People always LEARN from mistakes. If there are no solutions, how would people know their mistakes? Learning is up to the reader. If they cheat by copying the solution, could that hurt you (the author)? Well, that would only hurt themselve down the road because they don't learn. They will pay the price in final exams or job interviews."
4,if you have time read this one.,"This book is a good one, only that you need time and effort to make things settle down. Good for a long term study."
3,nothing new,As a student in comp. sc. i have seen a lot of books on algorithms and i really wouldn't buy this one yet. we used it for a class and there were quite a few bugs in the supplied code. Sedgewick is a good author but i would wait for the next edition without the bugs
2,"Answers to exercises (at least half of them), please!","I have decided that authors that are not willing to provide detailed solutions to at least the odd-numbered exercises are not worth reading. Why? Because first, where is the evidence that they know the answers to the exercises they present? But more importantly, how is the reader supposed to actually learn from the exercises if he can't see at least one possible solution and the rationale for that solution? This is the same reason why the Deitel & Deitel books are unacceptable. This isn't college anymore. Let's have some answers...if we knew how to do all this stuff already, we wouldn't need the book!"
3,THE place for standard methods - but just half the way,"It's a great book. Things are explained fine and it is usable in practice too. But take care, it is just the first 4 parts. Graphical algorithms are not included and I wanted to take a look at those."
3,MCDST Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-271),"Unfortunately, immediately after ordering this book I became aware of the fact that the second edition is now available."
2,Too many flagrant errors,"This book disappointed me. It contains many major errors (such as claiming that XP Home doesn't support NTFS compression or have an Administrator account) and dozens of smaller but significant errors. These errors would never have made it into the book if Microsoft had had a subject matter expert proof the book. In addition, the writing is often careless, such as when terms that should be given precise definitions are instead used haphazardly and inconsistently. It is a relatively easy read, but this is not a well-written technical book. Also, many of the practice questions on the included CD were an absolute joke, apparently written by someone with no real-world experience on the subject matter at all. Many questions and explanations were completely incorrect. Microsoft could have, and should have, done better."
3,Great and Informative Book,"Even if you don't go on and take the test, this book gives a weatlth of information.Drawback: the disc supplied expires after 30 days (I think its 30 days, if not, not much longer than 30 days)..........., so if you have little time to prepare for the test, the dics will not function properly after its time frame has expired. And,the cost of purchasing the full version of Microsoft Office hovers around 400 dollars or so."
3,My last hope for the test,"I read other comments for this book that make me buyed..I hope so, butthis is not a cover all Windows book..So those optimistics comments for the test results, looks too good to be the truth..I will comeback for comments after I pass or not the test.Thanks"
2,Did not help me,"This book did not help me much. I work as a Desktop Support Tech for a large business. Too many mistakes particularly when you use ""Readiness Review Suite"". I spent $50.00 for somebodies mistakes? I do not appreciate it! Finally, it is hard to find only one book to be on track."
2,Discription was different from what it said,"I puchased this book because of the discription said that this book is look like new.It wasn't. There is no CD, and it seemed like somebody tore it off.It didn't look nice at all. I couldn't read some parts because of it.I returned for refund. I will never purchase from here."
4,microsoft finally got it right,"microsoft has finally figured out how to write a book for their certifications. hire someone outside their organization to do it. previous books have always fallen woefully short of teaching a person to the point that they can come close to passing the test. this book accomplishes this goal. admittedly, this is a verrrry simple and easy test. but i did find the objectives covered adequately to figure out the answers. this was microsoft's big failing in previous books. they skimmed over or inadequately explained the topic and then hit you with detailed and complex scenarios on the exam that were several levels more advanced than what they taugh you. this book brings you to the level you need to be able to figure out the answers you need. this is what microsoft should have been doing all along. kudos to them."
5,Great Resource for Exam,"I just want to say using this book along with on the job experience was a great resource for passing the exam. If you don't have on the job experience you will need to study alot longer, but for those who are experienced the book will cover topics that you may not deal with everyday. It helps considerable in preparing for the exam. I was very impressed on how ready I was to take the exam after going through each lessons practice questions. The questions on the actual exam a are very closely related."
1,Same problem -- cracking down middle,"As another reviewer mentioned, after about one year of use (although... I don't think I got quite that much) this footrest started to crack down the middle. Before that, it seemed fine... worked well. But, I am honestly surprised that the manufacturer couldn't find a way to reinforce the plastic better -- huge design flaw IMO."
1,Piece of garbage,If I was able to give it Zero Stars I would. The foot rest started to crack down the middle. At first it was a minor crack and I was OK with it. But after a few months the thing has completly cracked down the middle and is useless now. I would seriously recommend buying another foot rest as this one is not up to par. Major design flaw on the part of Kensington.
4,We All Deserve the Royal Treatment,"Rebecca and Jane remember that they were once princesses in a faraway land until one night a terrible earthquake shook them and their queenly mother through time and space, dropping them into the trailer park where they live now. Unfortunately, their mother bumped her head on their journey and has forgotten she is a queen. It is only when they share their secret with an elderly neighbor that Jane and Rebecca realize that they may not be the only secret princesses, with or without queen mothers, in the area. There may even be a prince or two hiding nearby.Delighted readers will realize as soon as Jane and Rebecca do, that whether or not someone remembers his or her true status, it never hurts to give them the royal treatment.Leanne Franson's charming illustrations enhance this gentle story. Highly recommended for preschoolers to first grade."
5,My Purchase,"The CD came quiokly and was in great shape!!!-I am a large large large jazz fan all the players of all the instruments and styles of jazz- as long as it is playing the music!! - and I like the guitarists-- as well- Pat Martino, Steve Khan, Joe Diorio- and much much more-I am a jazz guitar [playerJimmyd"
5,Old Habits Die Hard,In ushering in the meiji era there was a man known as Hitokiri Battousai translated it means man slayer. He was greatly feared by all and anyone who met up with him perished to his blade but then suddenly he dissapeared and for years at a time noone knew what became of him. The meiji era is now in effect and swords are illegal except those carried by officers. Kenshin Himura the wandering samurai was once that legendary man slayer and as atonement for his sins he has sworn to never kill again so he carries around a reverse blade which is a sword that uses the dull side with the sharp side facing in. However bad habits die hard and evil seldom fades so now kenshin must protect his new found friends from that evil. Loosely based off of real life events Rurouni Kenshin is bound to be an anime you will love.
5,Does Kenshin know how to lose?,"You'll find out when he faces Aoshi Shinomori and his short sword. Not only that, Kenshin battles the mob boss armed with a gattling gun."
3,Something for late at night.,"First heard Lee on the LA Confidential Soundtrack but struggled to get anything by her here in Scotland - lucky I've got the Internet. CD is a bit of a mixed bag - some tracks have not transferred well to CD. But the ""live"" tracks take you right back to 1951 - smokey night clubs and Martinis! Next order for me - Ramblin' Rose."
3,"Comments on ""Serials and Series""","I recently purchased ""Serial Film Stars"", which was also written by Mr. Rainey, and was very pleased with it. I felt it was well worth the nearly $100 I spent for it. My satisfaction with this book led me to purchase this second book written by him which also cost about $100. I found it much less interesting than the prior book. My mild dissatisfaction with this book is based mainly on it's cost. My rating would certainly go up if the book had cost in the $50 range. In addition, the binding could be better. The cover is already starting to warp a little."
1,Sugar water,Is a product for kids that has sugar as ingredient #2 really recommended by the medical community? Aren't there alternatives with a bit less sugar?
4,SAME AS REGULAR PEDIASURE,"This is listed as ""Lactose free"" but what came is just the regular pediasure. I called amazon and they were going to send out a replacement until I talked to pediasure customer service and realized they don't make a special ""lactose free"" version but kids with lactose sensitivity shouldn't have an issue. We kept it and use it but I thought I was ordering a special ""lactose free"" version that doesn't exist."
5,My son loves drinking pediasure,This is something my son loves. Its pediasure he takes such a delight in drinking it. His been drinking prediasure for many years and it has help when he doesnt want to eat anything or not feeling well.
2,"Not lactose Free, misrepresentation of item.",Ordered one lot of 24 bottles and they arrived not lactose free so i had to contact Amazon and complain.Other than that Pediasure is great for Toddlers and kids who do not get enough Veggies and fiber. I just wish we got what we paid for.4 stars for the product and 1 star for Amazon's service.
4,Good for nutritional benefits and weight gain,"My daughter's doctor recommended we give her pediasure once daily in addition to cow's milk at her 1-year appointment to ensure sufficient weight gain. We incorporated 4-8 ounces once per day for 6 weeks and it certainly seems to have added in weight gain. My daughter was willing to drink the vanilla, which I think she really enjoyed. Before this, she was happy to switch between breast milk and cow's milk, but post-pediasure, hasn't seemed to want to drink the breast milk. Not sure if the sweetness/thickness of this drink were too much and that caused the change or what. I think if you really need the nutritional or weight gain benifits, this works. If not, I think it's too sweet and wouldn't risk getting a child hooked on it. We've now gone back to just the cow's milk and she will drink that just fine, however. Still no breast milk."
2,If your child is tube fed STOP buying pediasure!,Pediasure was recommended as an enteral feed for my child. At first I was fine with it. Then I read the ingredients. There is more sugar in one bottle of Pediasure than the American Heart Association recommends for kids for the entire day. Even the plus fiber version did nothing to ease my son's constipation. And I have heard from a number of parents that the product irritated their child's food allergies. I mix my own formula now - made with REAL food and I suggest all parents consider doing the same.
2,I MISSED THE ROMANCE PART OF THE ONE.....,"I do like Suzanne Simmons and I really enjoyed the first book in this series ""Sweetheart Indiana"", but this one was a real disappointment. I did not feel like there was any chemistry between Eric and Sydney. It was all kind of dull to tell you the truth. Finally at almost the very end they get together and there was very little sizzle and mostly a lot of fizzle as far as i was concerned. I'll keep reading Suzanne because this is the first one of hers i didnt like and i'm sure thats going to happen from time to time, even with our most favorite authors. If you want to get this one anyway, get it at the library or buy used, but don't by new, just wasnt worth it.."
5,A Student from UCDAVIS,This book is excellent for the beginners. People who think that the book is not good probably don't have enough elementary science background.
5,Best Ever Book for understanding Communication Systems,This Book is the best one to have evolved in the field of Communications and Signal Processing. I would recommend this to any undergrad/grad student in any part of the world. Enjoy reading this book!
5,Pleased with Purchase,The Book came in on time and in good condition. I had no problems and would be happy to do business again with them.
5,excellent book on communication theroy,This is a great book for building the foundations of communication theory. Serves great as an introductory text on analog and digital communications. Concepts are explained very well.
3,"Good book for the uninitiated, but....","This is a good book if you have just come upon the chili peppers and want to get an understanding of where they come from, but if you are a rabid fan, you won't be interested in this book because the author creates a distance with himself and the chili peppers, which makes them out to be these ""famous people"", without getting into who they are, and what they are about. Its basically like watching their behind the music story, with a few more trade secrets. Not worth it if you are a diehard Chilis fan, but good if you are just getting into them."
2,Alexs review,alrigh i read this book and i enjoyed it. i found some parts extremely boring though. i felt that the book focused more on the era the chili peppers were in and what was going on with music at that time than the actual peppers themselves. umm i felt it was really random and would jump around alot. it would go from talking about the chili peppers on one page and than the next page it would talk about the parental advisory stickers on CD's. although this book did have alot of information on the chili peppers that i had never known before. it was a good book but i have read better(Behind The SunJames Slovak)thats it
2,Want to read a real Red Hot Chili Peppers biography? Pass.,"This book is a collection of magazine bits, hear-say stuff and things picked from archives and mass media appearances. As some people pointed out already, there are a lot of errors as well. The updated version, containing data from 1993 to 2004 is not much better, either.If you want a book on Red Hot Chili Peppers written by a journalist/fan,Fornicationis a much better option. If you want a more genuine approach, tryRed Hot Chili Peppers: Me and My Friendsor get the official biography."
4,Bill Evans is still touching the inner cords of our soul,"1975 had been an happy season of grace for Bill Evans and this records is clearly stating it.since 1966 he was playing with Eddie Gomez on bass but Eliott Zigmung - the drummer - just joined the trio less than a year before, however, the emphaty among the 3 musicians is at his best.here are some standard tunes - some of them Evans' composition - and the trio is playing and bringing the memory back to the ""Evans,LaFaro,Motian"" trio who in the 60ies open up a new way to play jazz ... an innovative way (then followed by some other musicians) that, in a still fresh manner on this record, is touching the inner cords of our soul.Very recommended to everybody is fond of jazz and in a special way to whom loved that magical jazz moment called the late 50ies and early 60ies...I would rather rate this record as a 4 stars and an half ..."
5,102 dalmations rules!!!,"when i started the game, it all was new to me but i got the hang of it and so will you. getting the 100 bones and getting your siblings at the same time that you are being chased by someone is a little hard, just remember that you will have do a-lot of jumping, and don;t forget to destroy the evil robotic toys and cruella!!! don;t forget to use your nose to dig up bones. take your time with this game."
4,Woof!!!,It's fun!!!You can play as Odball or Domino.There's lost of chalenging levels.And mini games.It's a great game!
3,"Good, But Problems...","It's a good game, but I recommend the Playstation version of this. The computer one is bad.:) :("
1,Not Good,We tried it about 15 times. It's so slow.And half the time it didn't even work. It only made us sad bacause it didn't work.
3,Good but not pure white,"Arrived in perfect condition, the paper definitely isn't ""pure white"" though, it is more of a cream color."
1,Awful quality,"Bought a set and after 2 weeks they were scratched!!, even some that I only used once!!. I don't know if it is a quality control issue or what, but be warned these are made in Indonesia (asia is known for having a terrible quality control, if none) not in Germany or Luxemburg. Right now I'm replacing the whole set for a different one, not sure if I'm going to go for V&B again. I would rate these 0 star, but it is not possible to do. I like the way they look, though."
2,Not Good,"Amzaon mistakenly shipped 12 incorrect Villeroy & Boch dinner plates, the pattern was not even close. And two of the plates were received broken. Amazon was super about the return; and refunded my purchase quickly and efficeintly. I subsequently purchased the plates elsewere. The plates themselves are of the finest quality. (Other similar orders from Amazon were received in good condition. This order, just an anomoly?)"
3,Basically a slam v. Revisionists and Conspiracy researchers (not 'theorists'). Shermer tries comeback after Weber beat him down,"at the IHR in the 'holacau$t' shoah debatge(there's no bidness like shoah bidness)!Shermer, like many of his fellow charlatan/khazars follows the old talmudic formula ofkissing up to Big Brother and hoping to be'fed' with His...tory chanel cheerleading jobs.It must be rough on the rubber chicken circiut.Just ask Bernard Piper, Carto's stooge!"
4,The muscial talent of Howling Bells was present early on,"Fortunately, the Stein's did continue, replacing their bassist and changing their name to Howling Bells. For anyone who enjoys Howling Bells, this is a nice companion piece. Indeed, the standout songs are ""New Technology"", ""Lucky"", and ""Here Comes September"" [all available for your listening/viewing pleasure on YouTube]. However, the rest of the album is also worth the listen. Waikiki/Howling Bells have their own unique sound but you can hear the likes of the Cocteau Twins, the Cranberries, and even K.D. Lang in their music. Juanita Stein has an unmatchable voice but my favorite tune on this CD, ""Lucky"", is sung (wailed) by her brother. ""Lucky"" is also the song with the hardest driving rhythm and the best guitar work.This is a must CD for Howling Bells fanatics. I can't quite give it 5 stars, reserved for the likes of Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon""."
2,"good first attempt, but don't give up the day job","While I admire immensely the work Tom has done in his VC firm, and even more so for attempting to tackle a romance novel given his relationship with the romance queen herself - I found that this book did not live up to the hype -- it dragged on in several areas and was predictable from the beginning. A really good romance novel should offer elements of surprise, romance and tears ...this book did not have any of these qualities."
3,"Sexy, funny, light, fast, romantic, won't disappoint by the pool","Girls..... pack this book to take along on your next vacation. A little fantasy and romance, plus a few chuckles are guaranteed. The story is a funny twist on romance from a mature man's point of view. The best is the author's sense of humor which really comes through in the book."
1,An abomination,An argument in favor of book burning. Those first positive reviews must be shills. A complete waste of paper.
1,Please make this your last novel!,"I picked up this book based on the background of the author...afterall, he's built quite an empire at Kleiner-Perkins and obviously has experience and intelligence. Let's chalk this one up to a fun write for him perhaps detailing something he'd like to do in real life but would be too embarrassed in the final analysis.I didn't find the situations believable at all. Here's a bunch of gold-diggers who could find themselves knee deep in cash and society by sticking to their plan...that is, romancing and seducing the rich guy. But they change their minds at a moments notice and don't seem to think about the consequences before diving into kinky stuff or exposing their actual sexual tendancies.Frankly, I would have expected more from a guy such as Perkins with help from Steele..."
2,Keep your day job!,"Just because you are at the pinnacle of the business world does not mean you can be a successful fiction writer. This must be every older man's stereotypical dream to end up on a bachelor type show to have beautiful young women fawning over you. Every woman in this awkward narrative had some abnormal character flaw. Jessica James was the one woman who came closest to having some dignity. Yet she was the one who engineered the whole show ""Trophy Bride"" and you have to question her judgment in the end. Because of reality television, this book will hold some appeal for those looking for a light weekend read."
1,Revisits Old Stereotypes,"I'm always delighted to find a book that includes a character with autism. If that character has any special talent or ability, then more often than not that character is written as a cookie-cutter formulaic savant. To make matters worse, sooner or later others in the story compare the character to R*** M**, the title role Dustin Hoffman played in a 1988 movie. Most people with autism with or without savant abilities are NOTHING like that cliche character and R** M*** is a highly offensive slur in the autism world. I am sick and tired of savant stereotypes, especially since savantism affects less than 10% of the autistic population!"
1,Terribly Offensive,"This book must be every 60 something year old male fantasy. A rich old guy being fixed up with a dozen 20 something girls who only want his money and are willing to do anything to get it. The only female in this book with any redeemable features is Jessie. The others are all shallow and stupid and think nothing of jumping into bed with a man 40 years older to get his money. The worst part was Steven has sex with one girl the day before he sleeps with Jessie and then when she finds out, she doesn't care. Yea, like that would happen. And the woman he finally falls in love with is suppose to be his equal, but she is still 25 years younger than he is. In real life, the amazing Jessie wouldn't give this man the time of day. She is still young, beautiful and has plenty of money of her own. Like I said, this is a male fantasy. Any self respecting female should find it offensive."
5,Cheaper Than The Auto Parts Store,"Fits 2001-2008 3.0L Duratec V6 found in Escape/Mariner/Tribute, use a 7/8"" deep socket to remove the old one. Works great!"
1,piece of junk,"It does not hold my cell phone, does not adhere to the car dashboard and is completly useless.I would have returned it, but, I had to open the package before I knew it was useless, and I have no package to return it inb.I will probably not purchase further products through Amazon if you continue to sell such junk"
3,says universal but really isn't,says universal but isn't and dont stick to the dashboard like it should now i have to use a vent and i didn't want to . dont fit my phone untill the cover is off.
1,Holder does not hold,The problem with this is that there isn't a stopper at the bottom to hold it in place.
3,Cell Phone Auto Holder,"The cell phone holder is easy to assemble once you figure out how to change it from dashmount to air diffuser clip connection. Doesn't really give you the directions on how to. I bought it as Christmas gifts to go with other phone accessories. It's the same as the ones you find in the stores under trade names but for much, much less. Worth the price if you buy in quantity to offset the shipping costs."
2,Doesn't stick,"The function that holds the phone on this piece works fine, but the 'sticky' only stuck on my dashboard for a day, then fell off. I tried reapplying, but the black dash seemed to repel the sticking pad when it was hot. I hope this will stick with some double sided scrapbooking foam, but haven't tried it yet. It claimed to have 3M quality adhesive. I would NOT buy again."
5,PARALLEL LIVES IS THE BEST,"I have enjoyed watching Parallel Lives many, many times in the past and it never gets old. Kathy and Mo are of my generation and they are completely on point regarding the critical social issues they comment on in the historically best way possible: comedy and satire."
3,Doesnt fit a 2008 toyota matrix,"Loved the powder coating though, shame it doesn't fit. lacks one of the inputs for one of the hoses. product is also poorly finished. bought a fujita intake instead."
4,"Extra power, extra mileage","This kit does what it claims it will do. A 4 cylinder car will never be a rocket, but the kit did add some power to it. Also, I am getting an extra 3 MPG on average. The intake sounds nicer - like it's breathing now. Overall, it was a good decision to buy, but the key is that you have to be sure you know what kind of labor it will take to install it. I had a mechanic install it, but he is a friend. It took him 3.5 hours to install it, so just make sure that you know your mechanic (and the hourly rate) or do it yourself or else it's not worth it."
3,Doesn't hold much...,"This jewelry box doesn't hold a lot of jewels, but it is a very sturdy box with a beautiful leather finish. I gave it to a friend after using it for a few months, as it just didn't serve it's purpose for me."
5,Great Jewelry Box!,"The green was a nice color, and the box, overall was nicely made.All the compartments are great if you have a ton of jewelry (like me) and the little fold-up jewelry travel case is a great touch, and handy too!Overall, I highly recommend this jewelry box!"
4,Getting away from the theme parks,"This book is a great reference for people who live in Orlando and are always looking for something new to do on the weekends. Sure, many of us have annual passes to the theme parks but sometimes you want a change of scenery. Orlandoans are very luck to have so many great places to choose from, all within a 1-2 hour drive and this book organizes everything for you. I have been looking for a book like this ever since I moved here 2.5 years ago and now I have found it. I just wished it included more web sites in the directory (and maybe included the web sites right within the main chapters). Also for some chapters, there are more ""where to stay"" listings than there are ""where to go"" or ""where to eat"" listings. I thought it a little odd to include so many accommodations when the title of the book is called ""Day Trips"" from Orlando."
4,What a nice idea,"This four paperbook set will at the very least introduce kids to the idea of starting their own business by reading a short story with wonderful illustrations of how another child started a Pony Ride, Cookie and Fishing Business. There is also a workbook where parents can help their children plan for expenses and profit. It's not comprehensive but it will introduce the idea and that's important. These books can be purchased separately as well."
4,Good Old Fashioned Western,"A great trio of films with the BEST cowboy EVER. Being a Brit who grew up going to Saturday morning pictures,its great to be able to see some of his films in SUPERB clarity and pretty good sound. A nice touch was the Roy Rogers Club short which is also the great thing about DVD, you get a lot for your money. All in all, a great deal and good films. Please keep them coming!"
2,Balance is more suitable for older kids,"I ordered this balance for my 2 year old niece and nephew, but have found that it is not suitable for them at all. While I realize that the scale is designated for kids 3 and up, I don't imagine it is suitable for a child under 6. First, the buckets that hold the material being measured fall off of the base very easily. Second, the buckets do not move very far when there is a significant difference in the weight of the two buckets. The kids cannot discern the point of the scale for that reason. I had hoped that they would be able to put say, 3 blocks on one side and 2 blocks on the other and then be able to see that the two blocks side went up. That is not possible with this scale. The buckets have mL marks, which I suppose would be very helpful if the kids were in elementary school learning the metric system."
1,Awful product with no support,"I purchased this toner cartridge for my Lexmark Optra E312 laser printer as it seemed like a good deal at the time. The cartridge, which should last for 6000 copies at 5% coverage per page, lasted for less than 600 such printouts. I made efforts to contact the company via USPS, telephone, and email, but to no avail. No attempt was made to reconcile this situation, or to assist me with this faulty product. This lack of communication lead me to believe that it was much more than my toner cartridge that was faulty. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS. It is worth it to me now to purchase a toner by another company - one who will support and stand behind their products."
4,is this available on dvd?,I saw this movie years ago on the Disney Channel and taped it. I watched the tape several times after that. This is a really good movie that I think accurately captures the fear and tension between the colonists and the British that first day of the war. Does anyone know if this will ever be released on DVD?
3,Instead read The Search For Order,Businessmen and Reform is Robert H. Wiebe's first attemt at capturing the American Progressive Era. The Search for Order is his better work. I would only recommend this book if you have already read THe Search for Order.
5,"BOW ""WOW""!","DOG SONGS-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Released to cash in on Disney's ever popular 101 DALMATIONS series of flicks, DOG SONGS contains a litter of cute 'n cuddly canine ditties, sure to please the proverbial kid in all of us. Covering musical bases from RNB (Rufus Thomas' trademark Stax classic WALKIN' THE DOG) to rock (Jerry Lee Lewis' rave-up take on HOUND DOG) to novelty (the Monkees' whacked out I'M GONNA BUY ME A DOG), there ain't a ""you-know-what"" in the bunch here. Folk composer Tom Paxton's MY DOG'S BIGGER THAN YOUR DOG, which is probably more familiar as a Ken-L Ration ad, Dr. John's ultra-funky reading of CRUELLA DeVIL, and 70s crooner Lobo's ME AND YOU AND A DOG NAMED BOO all add to the frisky fun. Proof positive that WHO LET THE DOGS OUT shouldn't be the only mutt music your favorite youngster knows.RATING: FIVE WAGS"
2,Dog Pound,"This 'soundtrack' of dog songs was not a good idea. These songs are unlikable to anyone! And you don't have to go by my word alone-in the past 5 years (when it was released) it's only sold about 2,500 copies, if that. But the reason I gave it 2 stars is because it has 2 ok songs:(How Much Is) That Doggy In The Window &Cruella De Vilbut 'Cruella...' isn't even a dog song, minus it was in 101 Dalmatians."
5,great speed upgrade,i installed this into my ibm laptop. its an older laptop and this thing woke it up. my computer works twice as fast now and i can keep multiple programs open at the same time without having to worry about my computer slowing down. i have broadband internet and its great for that two. shipping was lightning fast!
1,The best of Tamilee Webb 2-pk,I didn't care for these. Seems like there were off the wall moves/exercises and it didn't motivate me at all
4,the long run,this is the second electric guitar ihave owned. now have five and an acoustic.i keep coming back to this epiphone becauseits always in tune and had great sustain forclassic rock and blues.you cant go wrong with this model it willbe around many years and the cherryburstcolor is perfect.
2,Sprung a Leak,"I wanted a hot water bottle to use in the bed to warm my feet; I loved this one at first, but after only four months it sprung a leak in one of the seams. I would not buy this again."
3,Don't love it,"The hot water bottle arrived quickly, but it is not quite what I hoped. It seems a little small and doesn't hold alot of water. Simultaneously the material is quite thick which is good if your water is very hot (ours is not). On the plus side it has a little handle on it to make it easy to hold under running water to fill. Finally, the color that came (there was no option to choose a color) was a ghastly lime green. Purple is pictured so I had hoped it would be purple but I did understand by the description that they would ship what they had. Don't love it but won't return it either."
4,Perfect!,"Great, simple, holds the warmth...does not leak and overall, just a sturdy product. I think the only faux pas was that I ordered one color...and got a different one. But to be honest, I don't care."
3,It Okay,Does the job but I would have been happier if it was a little bit larger in size like it appears in the image.
5,"Bought one for a friend, then bought one for myself.","I read various reviews and settled on this to buy as a gift for a friend. I had it delivered to myself so I could knit a cover for it, and in looking it over, I was so impressed by the quality that I bought one for my family a week later. I love the fact that there's no rubber stopper (our own hot water bottle had dry rotted just this past month, so the fewer parts to break down, the better), and while I was concerned about the size (another reviewer had said this water bottle was child-sized), that's not the case at all - this is the standard size you'd find retailed in a drug store. Due to demand in our house (five kids), chances are good we'll be buying another one soon!"
3,Honestly my dog does a better job,"When it's cold, I expect a hot water bottle to be HOT HOT HOT. And if it's not, then my dog does a better job. I'm over the fact that I expected a purple water bottle and got beige. But I am not at all over the fact that this bottle is not actually hot. It's more warm. And in an almost 100 year old house in a cold part of the US, I'd prefer a hot water bottle, not a warm one."
2,No color choice,"I didn't quite register that you get a random color when you order this water bottle. I got plain cream. Quality seems fine, but I was expecting green or red or...well, be warned, you get what you get!"
3,"Great sound, beware of player noise","Sound quality is excellent, ton of features (plays almost every music format there is, not to mention DVDs), compact and aesthetically pleasing. However, the unit itself is very noisy during disc play. A loud high pitch whirring noise from the CD motor can be heard over low to medium volumes. You'd have to pretty much set to high volumes when playing music or movies if you want to drown out any of the noise coming from the CD unit. If you can live with the noise, this is a good buy, nothing else compares when it comes to the available features. But beware, the inability of the unit to control disc noise may be why it's so affordable."
1,dead after a year,Another bookshelf system that stopped playing most discs after a year of use. Crap. Save your money unless you like buying a new micro system every 9 - 12 months.
4,the best of the bunch,"This came in a pack with three other princess games. Of the four it is the best with enough different activities to keep the kids amused. There is diving for gems, which has you diving down and having to collect air bubbles to breath while you also pick up gems until you have enough. An arcade type in too cool, a sticker game where you make a picture and the singing which only has two tunes that you can play. The last and probably most interesting was designing the dances and then watching the show, then are several dance patterns that you can add different movements too and two mermaids and three sea creatures that you can choose to dance.Overall its quite a good game."
2,disappointment,I expected more from the product. The wind must be just right for it to function as I think it should. Too much wind or too little wind won't work. I can't imagine it working inside the house. I bought several as gifts I am curious for my friends' opinions.
5,The Gemel Ring,I love all of Betty Neels books. Her books are fun and easy to read. I can read a chapter at a time and get right back into the book.
5,Spinning Ring,"I'll be honest. I don't care much for this ring (personal taste), but my husband (the one who bought and wears it) loves it and has worn it everyday since the day he got it. It's lightweight and the chain pattern in the middle of the ring actually rotates, i.e. ""spins"". He's constanly playing with it.The ring itself is still like the day he bought it, several months ago, and it has not tarnished or rubbed off in anyway. So I suppose it's worth the purchase."
1,"Dissapointed, and returned","This is a review of the product only - all interactions with the retail company were fantastic. I bought this ring based on the picture and reviews - however the reality was much different. The ring is extremely lightweight - and as a man, I prefer my jewelry with a solid, substantial feel. The detail on the chain was quite poor and at times individual links were melted into the other. The black contrast is not as significant or shiny as the picture conveys, and as a result of the chain being free to rotate, the ring makes a slight ""tinkling"" sound as your hand is moved. Return was accomplished quite easily using the original packaging and $2 for S&H and the credit was applied within 3 business days of receipt confirmation."
5,Portable and it works,"It was a good price, it came on time and was in the condition as stated. What more can you ask for?"
5,Great Book!,This book was excellent from the beginning to the end. It was easy to read and to understand. I felt like I was there with the characters. I could not put it down and would highly recommend purchasing his books.
5,Indeed,"This is a great movie that was very difficilt to find and still be affordable. As a movie that's been on TV, yet certainly not lately, it's a great addition for my movie collection."
5,Great videos at fantastic prices and great customer service,"I order all of my videos from Amazon.com because they have quality videos, even from the people that sell their videos to them. They are safe when using your credit or debit card and customer service is just great. The delivery time is always sooner than their estimate. I will always order from Amazon.com because they are solid and trustworthy. I am truly a happy customer."
4,Big Book Of Jewish Humor,"Lots for the money. A few of the long stories I couldn't really relate to, being a thorough goy."
1,A TRUE BOMB!!!!,"If this had a rating of less than one star, I'd give it. This is a HUGE waste of money, there is no Green Day interviews, no performances, just a bunch of people talking about Green Day. A 12 year old kid could have made a better DVD. Don't buy this, buy Bullet in a Bible instead. I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money."
2,best dvd ever... NOT!!!,CONTAINS NO MUSIC BY GREEN DAY. THIS DVD IS POGO PARADISE. HAS NOTHIING TO DO WITH THE BAND. WORST PURCHASE EVER! INTERVIEWS BY WHO KNOWS!? DANGER! DANGER! DO NOT i repeat NOT BUY THIS DVD. ANY GD DVD IS BETTER THAN THIS PEICE OF CRAP. 2 STARS FOR (POOR) EFFORT.
3,Top is cut too short.,"For all you moms out there, this top is cut very short. Kim Possible wears her shirt very short with her belly showing on the TV show. This top is the same. Yes, I suppose the argument could be made that it matches the character, but I do not want my daughter exposing herself at age 6. She will be wearing a black t-shirt under the top. I think the manufacturer's photo of the outfit is very misleading. It doesn't show how short the top really is. In addition, it is loose fitting. A small breeze would blow this right up and expose her breasts."
4,Great sequel soundtrack to Disney's The Lion King,"Disney has put together a quality CD, that is the sequel soundtrack to The Lion King, the number one soundtrack of 1994. While this CD might not be that big, it is one that will please those fans of the movie. It features songs inspired from The Lion King, and includes a new version of the Oscar nominated song Hakuna Matata that people of all ages will enjoy. It also features the song Warthog Rhapsody that was cut from the original soundtrack. It also features some great African music that many will enjoy. Rhythm of the Pride Lands is a great CD for all those fans of The Lion King looking for something new."
2,Only certain tracks interest me,"This is a good CD, filled with many interesting African beats, but only two of the tracks are good enough to listen to. The songs La Kelalela (whose singing reminds me of traveling through a clear African night sky filled with countless stars) and Lala are the best out of all of them. If your a fan of Afrian music, this would be a good CD to have, but for those who only here African music from time to time (like me), it probably wouldn't be a goof CD to have."
3,Nothing new.,"Average ""Girls Gone Wild"", nothing new, except the girls and location; and even some of that is repeat."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Frank, Joe and Chet travel to the Adirondack Mountains to help a family that has a history of werewolves in its ancestry and to aid their father in a case concerning sabotage at construction sites. The book starts well and ends well, but it gets a little off track in the middle. It could have been better, but was still worth reading."
3,Really 3 1/2 stars,This book was the average joe-smoe mystery book that made you ask it to stop or to continue. The book was fast pace in the middle when Joe fights the bad gue on the roof of a 24 storie building! Read another book.
3,"It's just ""OK""","Since the orignal price was $79 dlls and I was paying $25 I though it was a real steal. Well, I was wrong! The quality is not what I expected. The so-called tan leather was ""fine"", but the brown leather actually looks like plastic, making it look cheap. And the lining is not that ""plush"", it's just fabric...I also bought the version in metallic gold and silver and it looks a little better, but I wouldn't pay more than $20 dlls for this ""made in china"" roll."
5,Wonderful!,"I was extremely pleased with this jewelry roll travel case. The soft leather felt like it would melt in your hand. Also, the round inner zippered compartment was removable if a person didn't need that much room to store jewelry. I would not hestitate to purchase it again!"
4,Our dogs love it!,"Both of our beagles love this massager. It isn't very powerful, but we've had more powerful ones that one of our dogs wouldn't come near. It runs on an single AA. Seems a little pricey for what it is. It's made in China."
3,Rippin' 8-string steel,"On his seventh solo album, Junior Brown augments his signature truck-driving, honky-tonk twang with cool lounge-lizard jazz guitar (""You Inspire Me""), soulful Albert King-style string bending (""Monkey Wrench Blues""), and even occasional horns. But the highlight is Brown's Guit-Steel -- a custom doubleneck hybrid of Tele and lap steel -- which lets him jump mid-song between 6-string chicken pickin' and whining 8-string tone-bar licks. His steel playing is remarkable: Whether comping Western swing chords, plucking cry-in-your-beer country fills, or whipping out stuttering double-stops, Brown nails his lines with righteous intonation and a fat, swooping tone. As always, he delivers his tongue-in-cheek lyrics in a resonant baritone, his Guit-Steel timbres are unfettered with digital processing, and his solos have a live, reckless edge."
2,skip this biography,"avoid books where the author's personality and florid prose obscure the subject. besides, what precisely does jenkins have against short sentences and one-dollar words?"
2,Not so great,I thought purchasing a microwave from Panasonic was a good bet. This unit performs very well but only a few days after purchase I found the door would not close easily. I lubricated the latch area and this has helped. I contacted Panasonic and they wanted me to bring to an authorized dealer. I purchased Panasonic to AVOID these hassles.My advice is to get a different unit. This unit does not have a button to press for opening the door. It relies on a not very functional latch system. Find a unit with a button to open the door and you will hopefully be ok.
4,Gold!,"This video covers the extraordinary accomplishment of recovering things from the bottom of the deep sea. I read the book and was very interested in seeing some actual footage of the adventure. This video did that, although it glossed over the obstacles that were overcome to find and bring up the treasure. Read the book first, then watch the video to get the scope of the whole endeavor. Who does't like sunken treasure?"
4,Great cookbook!,"I come from a half Hungarian half German family and was looking very forward to receiving this cookbook. It did not disappoint! I found so many of our traditional family recipes in here and can not wait to try them out! The little added touches to this cookbook are pretty cool. For example, the author gives the background of Hungarian cooking, provides both the English and Hungarian names of the dishes, and sometimes a little side story with images about some of the recipes. I definitely recommend this cookbook!"
4,The best Hungarian dishes-new world style,"Just as the title says, the recipes are made using ingredients we more commonly use today. The Chicken Paprikash and galuska is delicious and the same my grandmother made here in the US after she immigrated. Lots of little tidbits about the Hungarian language as well as cooking. Instead of the dry, sweet cottage cheese for crepes, my grandmother always used powdered sugar. My siblings and i had contests to see just how many we could eat.A very nice array of some of the best Hungarian food-very nice."
2,Pay attention to the other reviews!,"After we installed the game it would not start It froze on a black screen and we had to go to Disneyinteractive.com to download an update. The link there didn't work so we had to email support to send us the update. We were highly anticipating playing the game by the time we were able to get it running and were very disappointed. The scenery and colors are lovely but the game is very difficult to play. It moves very slowly, hotspots are difficult to use, the instructions are badly written and there were not enough things happening on each screen to hold the interest of my five year old."
3,Good fruit chew,"This is a fruity, firm taffy-like candy with a somewhat less artificial flavor than many similar domestic (US) products. The fruitiness is pleasant and not the stock 'grape' flavor found in typical US grape candies.If you are a fan of fruity chews, check this out, it may not rock your world but is worth a try.I found the price to be a deal killer for me and will likely give this a pass in the future."
5,A must watch!,"this is a must watch for any car enthusiast into japanese car culture. i have a few DVDs and this is by far the best. i can watch it over and over and it doesnt get old. im talking about 80mph street drifting, touge drifting in a D1 car, track day drifting in car with a D1 driver (with multiple angles to chose from in the features menu). basically you need this DVD."
3,Valet,I dont normally write reviews. The box claims there is room for 2 pair of glasses. If the drawer was a quarter inch taller this would be true. I put avaitor style glasses in the slot and the drawer wouldnt close. I use the pen slot for tie tacks and cuff links.The glass top makes it perfect for Citizen Eco Drive watches.
1,Wrong Hat,"I love the ""Franchise"" fitted hats. They are actually the only type of hat that I wear. I love the fit and low profile. This review is not about the hat because I never received the right hat. I ordered this hat as a recent Gonzaga Masters student. However instead of the Medium Gonzaga Hat that I ordered I received an XL Atlanta Braves Cooperstown Classic Franchise hat. I processed a return and waited patiently for the correct hat to arrive. I just received the reship to day and again it was an XL Atlanta Braves Cooperstown Classic Franchise hat. I'm tired of the hassle. I must say that I am usually very pleased with Amazon but this experience has been horrible. I called Customer Service and very little empathy or concern was displayed. I hope that this is not a sign of things to come from my favorite online retailer."
2,Wrong Hat,"I received the wrong hat . . . not even close!Ordered a solid blue Gonzaga hat (College Basketball) and received a 2-tone, Atlanta Braves (MLB Baseball) hat.I thought the other reviewer just had some bad luck, but something definately stinks when 2 of 3 reviewers cant even get the right hat."
3,For baby...maybe,"Good item for cool evenings. I purchased this item to use for COLD days and evenings. It said it would be very thick and no coat is needed. Wrong!! It is thin and not as plush as was advertised. I bought it when my baby was 3 months old and her feet touched the bottom of the cover. It was marketed for use up to one year old!! My baby is in no way a giant. I liked the pockets in the front and the straps which indeed kept it in place and up. It shed on my pants, but is very soft. I use it for less warm days."
3,It's perfect for Summer evening only!,"The color and material are cute and nice. It can cover my baby in her infant car seat also. But it's only good for Summer evening though, not for Winter usage. For Winter, the BayBjorn cover is much better. And one suggestion to the manufacture: It should have a hood instead of a flap. Anyway, I own both: this one and the BabyBjorn one for different seasonal usage."
5,great,"I get dehydrated frequently. As an adult, this is the only flavor of Pedialyte I can really stomach. I use drink packets and measure the 20 oz of Pedialyte with the lemonade or whatever packet from the grocery store and I notice no taste difference."
1,Pass this one by,"This dreary book is more a study of satanism (rather than a study of the devil as a screen character) and simply fails to engage the serious film enthusiast unless he enjoys Schreck's self professed satanic beliefs. If you want a study of satanism, then give it a try, but if you are looking for a legitimate film study of satanism, look elsewhere."
2,good when it works,"I bought the white version of this about four months ago. Recently, I have had the fuse blow out twice. I have taken it to two authorized repair services, at great inconvenience. In both cases, all that was done was to replace the fuse. I spoke to the last repairman, who said that he looked diligently for the short that caused the fuse to fail but could not find it.What disturbs me is the attitude of Panasonic. As far as they are concerned, you can take to be repaired as often as you want until the one year warranty runs out. After that it is ""tough luck"". A good company would find a way to repair it or replace it."
3,"fun music, short changed!","Tighter Tighter is one of the sweeter bubble gum songs from the 60's but I loved the ""B"" cut on the single ""Sonday Mornin'""so why on this cd it is cut to less than 30 seconds?,I was very dissapointed to say the least!"
1,one song only!,"this is one sorry excuse for a cd! one song...""Tighter,Tighter"" worth listening to. but a good song from the past. shows they have talent, but choose not to even bother. this should be a 2.99 bargain basement deal. no other song on the thing is event decent! and i paid 13.99 for this? save your money."
3,"Tighter, Tighter","I didn't buy this ""album""; I actually purchased (downloaded) just ""Tighter, Tighter"" for my MP3 player, but for some reason, during playback (even via Windows Media Player on my computer), some of the voices are very faded; not like what I hear on the radio. I wish there was a ""radio"" version to download."
2,"tighter,tighter!!","IF JUST BUYING THIS CD FOR ONE SONG ALONE,IT WOULD DEFINATELY BE ""TIGHTER,TIGHTER""THIS SONG IS AN ALL TIME CLASSIC,ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR IT,I JUST WISH THE GROUP WOULD HAVE CONCENTRATED ON DOING MORE SOULFUL SONGS LIKE THIS,THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SOLD MORE RECORDS IN THEIR ERA!!"
1,It's a sleeper.,"Here we go, young adults paid to clean up an old house which is inhabited by a mean spirit looking for revenge. BORING! It's not good as a comedy, it's not good as a horror movie. All around it falls flat. It's done on a minimal budget, I mean you can see the camera at times. The actors do a poor job at their attempts, the demon woman is just NOT scary. There is very little gore, and none of that scare I was looking forward to. Again, it's not even funny, so...I don't know what the movie was trying to accomplish. CHEAP GARBAGE! zzzzz"
1,This review is from a guy who loves bad movies,"Yeah, I love bad movies! I love movies that are so bad that they're good! Hell, I love movies that offer absolutely nothing but stupidity and gore!But this movie isn't one of them. It's so bad that it's bad.It's a cheesy demon movie, but the demons don't appear until the last 30 minutes! It has some nice gore and some cool looking demons, but it doesn't make much sense, it's full of cheap jump scares, corny humor, the characters/actors are terrible (split personalities?) and nothing interesting happens until the last 30 minutes. Last time that I buy a movie that has a rating lower than 4.5. The worst thing is that I paid more than 20$ for it! It's one of those movies that should be in the 4$ bins.1.5/5"
5,Chesterton at his Best,"Insight into the subjects is truly amazing. Chesterton is so versatile. This is a good place to get to know one of the twentieth century's most prodigious, amusing and sensible authors. He should be required reading at all our schools. The problem is knowing where to start."
5,I love furbys,Furbys are so cute. they can do so much stuf. they can talk they can sing. they can dance and much more if i could i would buy every furby at the stores. i think evryone should have a furby their sooooooooooooooo cute. i love furbys
5,buy a furby,"I'm getting a furby for christmas I just found out I was looking at it push it bell it says ""you me friends hum...."" or some thing else i forget.once I tripped over a box when I was leaving the furby's hidding spott and the furby said oh-no.It really understood me.Don't buy a referbeshed furby because my best friend has one and it never shutsup and their is no off button and it awakes to anytype of noise so you'll end uo like me best friend and shutting it in the bath room and it will run out of batteries and you'll never replace them and you won't take out the batteries because i think it cries or something.the difference between the new furby and the olds ones is the new ones are way more cute,they don't talk as much as the old furby's,the new ones are bigger.Unlike the old furby's the new ones listen to you.buy a furby cause thier pure fun!!!!!!!"
2,Our Furby is NASTY!,"We have two Furbies (1 pink and this grey and yellow). They are supposed to talk to each other but this grey one GROWLS at the pink one, he won't talk to her. We tried to reset him (after talking to Hasbro) and it is the same. He doesn't say ""good morning"" upon reset (he is supposed to), he says ""Hey, I'm Furby!"". Hasbro is sending me a new one because they can't fix this unruly Furby...could I have received a Re-""Furbished"" Furby???"
1,Disgraceful: Not as described,"This product is listed as a 1 Amp AC/DC Adapter. It absolutely is NOT. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you think you are buying a 1 AMP adapter. This product has a 12VDC / 0.5A output. Shame, shame, shame on selling this product under false claims. Buyer Beware."
3,A-Frame History,"As a kid I remember these things going up. I remember helping others build their vacation home but never got the opportunity to help build an A-frame. When I saw this book, it became the next best experience to building and/or living in one.The author does a good job capturing the history of A-frames. Of interesting note is R.M. Schindler's A-frame house of 1922. Schindler worked on Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House. You can see the FLW influence in the elevations.The author also does a good job of explaining the decline of A-frames: The evolution of American lifestyles to make the jump from a ""second home"" to the consolidation of the permanent home with the vacation home.The biggest complaint I have is the size of this book. If you buy this book, make sure your bi-focal prescription is current. I found myself having a difficult time reading the tiny little words from this little book."
4,I live in an A-Frame,"I live in an A-Frame so this book has much meaning for me. I loved reading about the history and seeing many A-Frames from around the world. I certainly would have let the author come to my house. It's a bit larger than most in the book - 2,800 sq. ft. I highly recommend the book to anyone with interest in the subject."
2,Worthless for the truly shy guy,"I believe that this book may be worthwhile for the guy who is outgoing with guys, but is shy with girls. That is, someone who has plenty of guy friends, but no girlfriend. However, for those of us who suffer from social anxiety and low self-esteem, this book doesn't have the answers. Mr. Dutter simply says to go up to a girl and start talking to her. If I could do that, I wouldn't have needed this book!"
1,Talks the talk...but doesn't walk the walk,"Dutter starts out the book with a great ""I feel your pain"" chapter that made me have high hopes for this book. However, the Dutter does not actually offer a way for a shy guy to overcome his shyness and go up to a pretty woman in a bar (let alone strike up a successful conversation with her). Instead, Dutter suggests waiting by the ladies room and letting women approach you, lowering your standards, and acting like ""Clueless Guy"" to convince women that you can't take care of yourself on your own. It's a bit entertaining at times, but certainly not helpful."
1,Oh Man. Who Greenlighted this Book? It's Simply Awful.,"While the premise is decent enough, the material and suggestions offered by the author are dreadful. Why its a mainstay in the dating section of mega bookstores is a bigger mystery than how the Steelers won the Superbowl.Hopefully guys realize at this stage in the game that 'pickup lines,' no matter how clever or nuanced, simply don't work. Why? Because while giving you a moment's attention, most are either crude or insulting, forcing a woman to respond in a way drenched in irritation. And compliments come off trite or insincere.Far better to engage people in social settings with a set routine that conveys all the best qualities about you.If you're looking for great material to approach women, look elsewhere.- GiddyupGuy"
5,A great book,"This is a very handy book! I find myself consulting it constantly! It is like a Bible for Shy Guys!I reccommend it to any guy who wants to meet girls! It is also funny. Dutter uses his skills as a stand-up comedian to cover the dating scene, with all its triumphs and tragedies.Dealing with the pain of rejection has never been so funny!"
3,"Entertaining, but heard it before.","There are a few entertaining stories in here, but no real secrets for the shy guy. If you've listened to your friends try to build your confidence to talk to a girl, you've heard this before."
1,"The Shy Guy's Guide to Dating: The Best Places to Meet Women, the Ten Best Pickup Lines, How to Tell if She Likes You, Eleven Wo",This book looks lame and bored. I am not going to read it all. I thought this book talks about funny story but I was wrong. It talks about how to find lovely women for date. Do not buy it.
3,hmm...,It was alright but I have heard better oi than this... not to bad thought but one thing is all the sonds sound they same....
1,I DESPISED this book.,I threw up on this book twice out of dislike. The characters are uninteresting the plot is old and gross.
2,"Amusing, but boring","When I first saw this book, I thought it would be cute and entertaining. It was at first, and I was eager to find out how the three sisters fit-in into their new world. It amusing, but then quickly got boring and there was way too much dialogue. And a quick note to the author: Have you ever heard of detail? Because you sure didn't use it in this book! And also, I noticed in the begginning of the book, Thalia and her sisters said things like ""cool"" and ""blame game"",which I'm SURE isn't accurate. And no, they didn't learn them from other High-schoolers. They said them before they even met any people from earth. The book quickly loses it's spunk and just repeats itself over and over about Polly's little love problem and things like that. So, if it's a rainy day and your REALLY bored, you might want to try this. Otherwise, you can do better."
1,Boring!!!!,"The plot is predicable, there is almost NO DEATAIL!!! If you can't go to sleep one night, read this book. It will put you out almost instantly. I had to tell myself that it will get better as I go but it just got worse. And it's super-short. I reccomend getting another book. Almost ANY book would be better than this."
3,3 strange kids,"This book is a little offending at first,if you believe in God,because the girl's father,Zeus,is referred to as ""the God of Heaven and Earth"".It doesn't help that he acts all wimpy around his wife,the evil Hera from Hell.It's weird but it is also a fun-enough novel with funny bits.The 3 sisters have been up to no good,up there in the Heavens so they have been sent to earth to learn their lesson.They expected to land in 400BC but,by accident,they end up in 2002 and attending high school.The funniest part is their helper Helme's list of how to survive on Earth,which he has compiled by watching the television.(for example,it is important to chant Oh-Prah!Oh-Prah!).Anyway this book consists of their first crazy couple of weeks on Earth."
2,In one word: typical . . . .,"""Heaven Sent"" by Clea Hantman started out pretty good. Thalia and her sisters, Polly and Era pulled a prank that ended up making their stepmother green---literally---so they were sent to Earth as a punishment.They are forced to stay there until they learn the things set out for them.Anyways, Polly falls for this earth-guy named Tom. He seems nice and cute and all of that, except he seems to be too fake---unrealistic, like the main characters are. And he is . . .It has something to do with the muses ""three least favorite girls"" in the universe, the Furies aka the Blessed Ones.I won't get into that right now because then what's the use of buying the book??This book was kinda boring. Actually not KINDA. It WAS boring. Good thing I only bought it for $. But still, that's $ too many.If you're in the mood to kill some time---or bore someone to death---go ahead. Read this book. If not, there are many other better selections."
5,Very pleased,"Speedy delivery, great condition--even better than described. Also a nice little note of thanks from the seller goes a long way :) Thanks!"
5,"Words of wisdom, hope and peace from a woman of the forest in northern Siberia","Anastasia (The Ringing Cedars, Book 1)This is the first of nine books in the Ringing Cedars Series now translated into over 20 languages.I am a slow reader, starting many good books that I never finish. But Anastasia (and each one after) just got better and better. Read just one and you too will understand why 10 million copies were sold before they were ever commercially advertised--just word of mouth.The author presents the life and lifestyle one who lives in harmony with the earth and all life. Her story shows us how to do the same. So much of what I've always known is finally put into words."
1,Merely a middle-aged man's fantasy,"I have to report that this book is the most ridiculous thing I have ever read. It reads like a middle-aged man's fantasy of a young, beautiful, innocent-yet-wise woman who will have sex with him, show him the wonders of her world, and frolic in the forest like a wood nymph (she is forever twirling around, leaping, diving into the water, and treating the animals like how you would see a Disney princess treating them - like subservient placid pets (even wild wolves and bears!)). The character Anastasia seems to be based on the character Ayla from the Earth's Children series by Jean Auel. Those books are a much better read, don't waste your money on this one."
1,So stupid I didn't even finish it,"I read lots of books every year, usually 5 a week. I've got to agree with the other 1-star reviews, this was a real stinker. It reads like a fantasy of a middle-aged, bored mid-life crisis suffering man. The ""morals"" espoused are ludicrous, along with the story line. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Pure myth.,"This book is pure myth and absolutely does not offer anything new no matter what anyone argues. I read nothing new in this book. It is also very poorly written. It is understandable that Russians were starving for anything spiritual after Communism was finished with them and this was something spiritual and Russian which explains the success it had there. Outside of Russia, it is hard to explain the popularity of the book except to remember that people are sheep, easily led and swayed. I gave up Christianity which has more depth than this so why would this move me? It amazes me what people will fall for. Yes, I know, I know, I know...it is a matter of faith and this book will take alot of that."
5,Wonderful first book in the Ringing Cedar series,"I've been traveling around for the past few years and I gave my original copy of Anastasia away. I'm very pleased to have a new copy in my possession, as it's such a wonderful first book in a quite remarkable series. This copy I'm keeping."
2,Scam artist,"First of all I bought the Anastasia with the green cover (cost $14+) and was sent the black ($11+) cover instead. I requested the difference back but didn't get it. The writer starts by enticing the reader with a promising story about an energy found in a cedar tree which, if worn as a medallion, will cure all types of ailments and even extend life. Then the story goes off in a completely different direction for several chapters like the cedar medallion isn't the point of the story. For instance he is talking to a woman about his wife and moments later he is having sex with this woman. Also the planting sequence is a revelation in BS. Then later in the book, this woman talks about how her parents heads explode from energy coming from the cedar trees. All in all I think the writer is sitting back laughing at everyone that has spent money on his books. I do not recommend buying this book unless you like giving your money to someone who enjoys BS'ing other people."
2,Surprised,"I read many reviews on how wonderful and life changing this book was prior to purchasing. I was really excited to receive it! However, I was sadly disappointed. The author came across as rude and I thought the writing was horrible. If you are looking for a better read..I would suggest The Celestine Prophecy."
1,sexist loon cons readers,"DO NOT waste another ounce of energy on this horrid waste of paper! Highly insulting to even the most modest intellect; to women; to Russian's; naturalists; researchers, etc., etc. What a tragedy that this kind of nonsense can even be published."
5,A puzzling and fascinating Russian novel.,"On the opinion of a friend I read the first in this series. I must admit I did come away with a lightness, and smiles on my face. I am intrigued with many parts of the philosophy mixed in this unusual fairy tale like story. Actually it has caught me so much I have ordered the second book and I am currently reading it as I watch my sunflowers dance in the wind. Hope you enjoy it too and that you let its 'magic' of tantalizing your mind have some positive effect."
2,Principals of nature tailored for the next movie script,"Many of the concepts of this book are simple and beautiful. Then fantasy comes in...lured in the form of ""out of this world"" spirituality.By intuition I feel the author is not fully sincere with his writing; it almost feels like in his mind he was preparing to get a movie script offer after writing this book.The sequence of events is also semi-scattered. Based on the first book only...you dont quite get to connect the dots with his primary purpose of re-visiting the village of cedar trees (to connect with the two gentlemen he ignored during his first visit). In addition it's beyond cheesy that his 'materialistic-spiritual-then-materialistic-again journey' includes some sex and money/fame talk...I would categorize this book as FICTIONAL-ADULT RATED DISNEY SERIES - FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY!"
4,The perfect woman!,"This book is a page turner. I'm sure male readers will picture Anastasia as a super model but without the foxy attitude. It does sound more like fiction though, but it could be due to the writer's style. I can see why some people get nice feelings from reading it. Some of the things Anastasia talks about (according to the author), such as putting a seed under your tongue before planting it and stepping on its soil with bare feet, are things we should try just to see if it works. Nevertheless, I may be beyond help since I haven't been (as some readers have) inspired to write any poems yet."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought the books after reading that ad in Nexus Magazine. Boy, was I in for a shock. Her writings are distinctly homophobic, degrading to women by her moralistic ""values"", sleeping with someone who took her fancy. A waste of money since I bought 7 books at a go. Gave they away, should have disposed them in the bin. One star is too much, so that goes for the translation work.John Robbins"
5,stunning,Stunning and fantstical. Beautiful story and captivating. Recommnd this read to any spiritual person or anyone who wants to be entertained with whimsical or spiritual content.
1,Serious scam.,"As I read this book I couldn't decide whether it was a middle-aged man's long excuse for cheating on his wife or just a money-making scheme. But I finished the book without coming across any expression of love or remorse toward the wife, so the first reason is definitely out. The second reason seems undeniable however, as the book prophesies near the end that the author will become, ""the richest person on Earth.""So glad I did not buy the book. So disappointed that someone must have paid for the book before they gave it to me."
5,"MUST READ - inspiration, life changing, brilliant","This is the wonderful story or let's say biographie of Anastasia and her life, her tuning in with Mother Nature, unity with the animals, forest, plants, everything, everyone .... unity and insight pure. Enjoy the journey - once you start you will want to read all 9 books. Thank you to Anastasia. / B"
1,Forced to read this for a book club,"Despite identifying with the voices in the many one-star reviews of this book on Amazon, I caved into pressure from our book club leader to read this book. Thank goodness I refused to buy it and borrowed hers after she was finished with it.I found myself rolling my eyes and sighing in disgust throughout this horrible, ill-conceived story about a sexy wood nymph that teaches a rude married man how to plant seeds- right after she has sex with him to give him the son he always wanted. Squirells bring her food like little tranced-out slaves and she some how is some sort of gardening guru (but I thought she didn't cultivate food- what?).Spiritual enlightenment is not achievable through this horrendous excuse for a book. Don't waste your money and don't give in to peer pressure. I'm going to order some decent books on Amazon and try to forget how annoyed I am that I bothered with this piece of garbage."
1,What a gullible lot we are,"First the Secret, now the Ringing Cedars series, fueled by massive media hype, but in truth containing very little substance, and what substance there is is questionable. I am fed up with our gullible jumping on the bandwagon with every stupid ""new age"" book/DVD that comes along. A little discernment would go a long way."
1,GARBAGE,How much hate garbage can there be against President Bush? The liberals are truly organized in their hate/smear campaigns...and they scream the loudest and longest if they think someone has said something bad about them. I can't believe Amazon would sell a piece of trash like this.
2,Got a bad one!,3 months after I got this microwave it quit working! It slowly started losing power until it would not heat a cup of water but the top of the microwave got very hot to the touch.I had to take it to an authorized repair center to have it fixed and I don't have it back yet but I hope it lasts this time.I don't know if this is just a fluke but I am done with panasonic. They used to make good products but this is the second microwave that has had problems for me.
1,second-rate,"This microwave is a real disappointment. The automatic sensor is extremely inaccurate. The ""Reheat"" setting overheats and the ""Popcorn"" setting leaves about half the kernels unpopped. Also, the keys on the ""touch"" panel require so much pressure that it's almost painful. I bought this microwave only a week ago and I can't wait to replace it. (In fact, I'm buying a replacement this afternoon and giving this one away...)"
2,"Not bad, poor handle design","I just got this unit at a retail store to tide me over til I could order from Amazon. I'll be getting something else.GOOD: Very powerful and quick, surprisingly quiet.BAD: When you go to open the door by pulling on the handle, the whole microwave moves! I'll be replacing the unit with a Panasonic 7x3 with a push-button door release."
5,big light for a little lamp,I first used this lamp at work. I thought the light that it produced was excellent for its size. The one at work came from Ikea. I discovered that Ikea discontinued this model. The new Telelite Halogen table lamp is the same one that Ikea used to sell. I highly recommend this lamp.
4,Nice-ok,"I got this lamp in black. It works, the only problem is that the head can't really hold its weight up if extended out all the way. Nice light, not a very good reach unless you don't mind it hovering low to the surface."
2,desk lamp,"I love this lamp. It's small, but bright enough for your desk. The neck part can stretch/shrink. On the contrary to someone's review, it got on/off switch at its main body.Ok, it lasted only one year. Even with that one year, we had to change fuse three or four times. In the end it just died. Something maybe wrong in electric circut. I have to change my five stars to two stars as a result."
2,Flimsy,This thing is made of super cheap parts. It also does not provide very much light. It is reasonably adjustable but just not worth it in my opinion. It is usable but I am disappointed.
5,Wow,"I was extreamly happy to find such a well researched book. It was interesting, and yet it stuck to to facts and kept the reader informed. I am looking forward to reading more by the authur."
5,the better witch,i think DIANA G.GALLAGHER should be given kudos for writing a book on magic that's not sentimental as others 0thers.sabrina as said in the book does not depend on her powers for everything on like tanya.the book is very interesting and should be given an award. when i watched the film i knew that the book whould be fun to read. i just want to say i love the narrative techniques of ms diana. 'mind over magic'ilove that line it really portrays sabrina to be better than tanya who wears her pride on her skin
3,"Not bad, not bad at all","I can't say I loved this book, or that it's the best in the series, but it is nevertheless a rather fun book. Read it if you have nothing more interesting and thought provoking, or just if you want a light read."
3,OK but kinda boring,"This book is kinda boring because it carries on to much at certain parts. It's all about when Sabrina's cousin comes. At that time they are doing a job for school.Libby wants to mess it all up on Sabrina, Sabrina's cousin is really mean and also tries to mess everything up. Diana G. Gallagher is usaully really good but this one, on my opinion, is definetly not her best."
4,Excellent Book.,"I think this book was good, even though it was very slow to begin with. It's all about Sabrina's cousin Tania coming down and determined to ruin her life. Sabrina soon finds out it's a test... Amy Ryan - 13"
4,THIS BOOK WAS PHAT,I think this is one of the best books I have ever read and think that everyone should read it. It was about Sabrina having to do a teen weekened project over the weekend. But Libby wants the same job Sabrina wanted and Libby was the persone who wrote out the papers with the jobs on it. While Libby is drawing Sabrina notices a pieace of paper with a mark on it and uses a little spell so that Libby would draw a different one. soon Sabrina is at the job she wanted and every thing is fine with some help of some magic. But that was until her cousin arrived and started some big problems and even threatens to make Sabrina loose her job!!
5,Nextels best basic phone,"I have had this phone for about 3 months, and it is a pretty basic phone. It is very durable, I have dropped it too many times to count, and it only has a scratched screen so far. You have to pay Nextel if you want to add applications, ringtones, or even the speakerphone, but if you have the knowledge and a piece of software called Motorola RSS, you can edit the phones codeplug and unlock the speakerphone, or use WebJAL to add ringtones and apps."
1,Bad Product,"I got this phone for a back up and it's not even good for that. VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor. The DC speaker has loose parts in it so when I am in a DC conversation there's so much rattling it makes it hard to hear. The Charger port has a cheap rubber flap covering it that won't stay shut. There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before. The battery lasts me a day if I don't use the phone, with minimal use I find it dying long before the end of the business day. I'm very glad my i710 is on it's way because this thing is just junk. You definitely get less than what you pay for with this item. Many of my friends have left Nextel because of the poor product Motorola is putting out for them. This phone is no exception."
4,Wow!,You can't beat three DVDs in one box set. The pay per views each are about $40. The individual DVDs when they first came out were about $18-20 a piece. You get three pay per view events in one package...WOW! Worth the money if you are a TNA fan but refuse to buy ppv expensive events!
4,Raw Paradis,"I'm a big fan of Gustav Klimt art so I have to admit that the cover art pretty much sold me. Apart from that, the music is exquisite Vanessa Paradis but the reason I bought the album was for the song Emmenez Moi which I discovered is only available through the website which you can only access through the CD. Fair enough I suppose, but I wished the 3 bonus tracks on the website was on the CD, they were very good."
4,Good size & thickness,"Our dogs are oddly particular about their rawhid chips: they insist on having them, only like chips vs bones or longer strips, and they seem to scoff at those they find too flimsy. They had no complaints upon trying these (which makes us happy to have dogs quietly chewing something appropriate!)."
2,Chips not thick at all,"I must have received the wrong package based on the Product Description! These chips vary in size - but are not thick as described. Can get the same item at PetSmart, Petco or Target for same price or less."
4,An Existential View of Colour and Sight,"Clever, original, speculative.Ideas like Goethe's are the wellspring of new fashions in thought, whether they are 'right' or not.Maybe Newton was supported by better evidence in his analysis of light and colour, but Goethe's views are a study in how the inquisitive human mind speculates on fascinating topics and comes up with answers that demand consideration and respect - whether they are 'right' in reality or just useful as ideas in themselves.This book will provide insights into how we think, not just how we explain phenomenon."
3,Goethe revewing colors,"When you buy a book like this you should know that many of his assertions were not correct, it is written in a old style, obviously if he is the author, thing that makes it a bit dense, but despite these considerations and if you are studying the Color Field, just buy it"
5,Happy Colours,Very impressed to find the book as describedeither someone was very careful or it didn't get read more than once; either way I am glad.
3,Game Framework,"Mr Croft explains his game game framework in this book. This framework is capable of handling 2D games via network, especially for mobile games. The book looks old fashing with a cumbersome layout and code examples which take a lot of space. Also the explained code seems to be old fashing, the new features of jdk1.4 are only mentioned about images, while the java.nio package is missing. Only some advanced topics are touched. This book is a good basic to enter the field of game programming in java, but doesn't lead you to the advanced topics."
2,Misleading title,"This is not by any rate a book on advanced Java programming! It just has some very ugly 2D swing-based applications (you really cannot call them games..). Avoid like plague. Java game programming is still in a very immature stage but if you' re really, really looking for a decent book on Java game programming try ""Developing games in Java"" by David Brackeen."
5,Well worth the wait!,Eric Roberson left us for a while after his 1st CD...but this album was definately worth the wait. He successfully experiments with various sounds that provide for easy listening. Truly a work of art.
5,Sound familiar.....but I like it!!,"Im disapointed that I wasted time not knowing about Eric Roberson. He sounds great. But can anyone else tell that his ""sound"" reminds you of Dwele? even so, he's awsome just like Dwele."
5,I left my Ex when......,"I heard Too Soon and Pretty Girl because the words reminded me of something this guy, who I really loved, would say to me if given the chance. I left the ex and got with ""that"" guy!"
5,diamond and pink sapphire earrings,"I received these lovely earrings for Valentines day. They were smaller than we thought, petite and tiny. Colored a light pink with sparkling diamonds."
1,Band snapped,"The band on this watch snapped and there is no repairing it. I talked with my friends who had this watch and one of them said her band snapped 4 times in a year. She's finally quit replacing them. You'd be better off buying one with a replaceable band, or at least one with less-brittle plastic."
2,Nike watch,Thought from the description I would really get some good use out of it...could not figure out how to get it to work...what a dud...they must make these things easier to work and the instruction would need an engineer to figure it out.
2,Warning: Post-structuralism ahead,"If you want your eyes and mind opened to beauty and meaning, try ""The Nude"" by Kenneth Clark. If you want a tedious specimen of what Harold Bloom calls ""the school of resentment,"" this is just the thing."
3,A specialized work,Berger et al have produced an interesting work. It isn't something you would need to just have around the house for fun though.Great for teaching and/or exploring creativity.Berger's emphasis on materialism/communism can get tired sometimes.
4,Not as out of date as some would have you believe,"Several other reviewers say this book is out of date. In some ways, yes. But some of the most important points of this book still seem valid.Specifically:1.) Art is an artificial market whose value is talked up by art historians and gallery owners.2.) The depiction of the female nude in art has always contained a exploitative voyeuristic overtone.3.) The measure of man's power lies in who they can have power over.4.) The measure of woman's power lies in who can have power over them.It's small surprise his opinions were buried by academia and the art establishment. These were never popular opinions, but taken in the context of art history and the art market they provide a great counterpoint.Even now, this book is a great way to demystify the art market for the art student."
1,Are You Joking?,"What a farce! As a photography instructor, just a quick glance through this book shows me the author either did too many drugs in the 60s or was overdosed by 70's Soviet propaganda or both. It teaches nothing concerning ""seeing"" except seeing through anti-capitalistic eyes--the same system that provides for crazy art and fortunately keeps the good quality art floating to the top like cream on milk. I was amazed that after the first couple of incoherent chapters, the samples are almost entirely comprised of seductive naked women. I think the author would revel in the artistic freedom now available now on www.youporn.com. This book teaches nothing concerning seeing, art or aesthetics. My copy goes in the trash. Why do people praise this work. It reminds me of the writings of Timothy Leary, who was irrelevant then and always."
1,Dreck,"Dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck,dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck,more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, and more dreck, and more dreck, and more dreck . . . you get the idea?"
3,"Decent, kind of disappointed",The quality of the picture inside this book are of horrible quality. You have to squint to try to understand what is in the content of the picture. Very disappointed about that.
5,All around thorough view of seeing,"I haven't finished the book yet, but it is great so far! The thoroughness on the ways of viewing art/ourselves/photos/etc is amazing. I have never read something this in depth on perspective and so thorough on every angle. I recommend this book to anyone so likes to view every angle of a situation."
4,Glossy,"This is a very light book from William Gann. Other books that I have read by him are much deeper, and provide much better information. When I purchased this book, I also purchased How to Make Profits in Trading Commodities. That book is a much better buy, than Truth of the Stock Tape."
2,truth of the stock tape,"i would have like to have read the book,,,but did not receive it,,,i guess ot os okay....steve"
3,It was good while it lasted,"The microwave did very well for the year and a half we had it before it broke. For some reason, I think the circulating dish broke or something. It still turn, but there was a lound popping and cracking noise. Like something broke off and got stuck in side. As for the machine itself, it defrosted and cooked well. Noise level is a little loud, but not too noticebly. As for buying this again, I'm not very sure I would because I don't want to have to buy another microwave again. But I might try another Panasonic brand."
2,Panasonic Customer Service needs to get the marbles out of their mouths,"After a year and three months my Panasonic NN-S753BF is dead. Nothing at all... not lights, nothing. I've tried plugging it into different outlets, etc... but there is no juice. I called customer service to see what they can do... not a super plesant experince. The lady was somewhat helpful... but she was very hard to understand. She has a case of the mumbles. It took her about 20 minutes to get the words out that there is nothing she can do for me. The microwave is no longer covered under waranty...I haven't decided if I am going to take it in or not... it was very loud and made funny noises when it worked. I am FOR SURE NOT going to buy another Panasonic microwave."
4,If only it lasted...,"Works great. Good features. Loved the 1.6 (huge) capacity. Lasted only 1 year, darn near to the day, but just enough to get Panasonic out of the warranty. We've replaced it with a newer (smaller) model that has a browning feature (via toaster coils on the top of the cavity and pre-heating a special dish) and multi-stage cooking timers. The new one definitely cooks fried foods better -- they stay crispy with the browning dish. In the NN-S753BF, like all microwave ovens, breaded and fried foods just get hot and soggy from the steam bath."
2,WHAT A WASTE !!!,"with such a fine cast ans script, one could expect an outstanding picture, but, alas, this is the early 60's, with the same wrong formula applying for years to any big production : lots of stars, and an inadequate director, leading most of the time to............poor results !!!Martin RITT definitely is unable to give this film an epic form and keep it going, of course the producer Jerry WALD is much to blame, when he should have confined to films like ""PEYTON PLACE"" or"" THE BEST OF EVERYTHING"". It is painful to watch fine actors and actresses like Dan DAILEY, Eli WALLACH, Diane BAKER and Susan STRASBERG completely miscast.The only good moment comes from a striking performance by Paul NEWMAN as a dumb ""has been"" battler, hardly recognizable under heavy make-up."
5,a wonderful collection,I love this collection. It brings me back to Hemingway who I read while growing up in the Fifties and Sixties. The restorations of the Scope movies are outstanding and the extras are informative. The cinematography and music of Adventures of a Young Man are very moving. This film brought me back to my youth. I highly recommend.
5,Hemmingway classics,Wonderful edition of classic movies based on Hemingway books. Great addition to any video library - timeless and well done movies that are not too far off the books they are based on.Would make great gift.
5,Required resource for parents and lending libraries,"These two movies are a must for anyone with children in their midst. Parents, educators, puppeteers, musicians, anyone with an imagination would enjoy these films. Here are some films you can take anywhere. For example, I once saw a church leader play the Labrynth for his high school group meeting.The messages in both movies are timeless and inspire group or personal discussions. In true Jim Hensen fashion, these films are outstanding pieces of work that should be shared with children and adults alike."
3,Good if you don't own them already,"Labyrinth and Dark Crystal were some of my favorite movies growing up and I wanted them on blu-ray. they were already released on blu-ray but I wanted to wait until a special edition was released. Well this edition is simply the blu-rays that was already released in a new packaging, I'm very disappointed but at least I didn't already own the blu-rays or it would've been a waste of my money."
5,Fantastic Pair!,"Have loved this for years, and now it's converted to high quality so our kids can enjoy it too. Very highly recommended."
3,Where are the maps?,"Lots of good pictures, but not one decent physical or political map to help the reader orient himself with the text. Thirty-five dollars for a history book with no maps?"
2,"Great IDEA, but not durable...","I purchased the Gold Rolback Net about two and a half years ago. I live in Indiana and therefore store the Rolback net in my heated garage during the winter.This is my problem: regardless of the extra care given to this product, I already have 5 ""breaks"" in the netting at various locations. I love the product, but I can't afford to replace it for $100, every couple of years. The warranty is only for one year, therefore the cost is on the owner's shoulders.Richard"
3,Kinda Lame.,"But, its PAPER-BASED. So what did I expect?Not like the clay in your art class, its still pretty malleable. The clay I got was really dry. I had to pretty much soak it in a wet cloth before being able to roll or mold it into anything-- even if I were to make the beads depicted on the box. The price is nice. But I'll buy Crayola next time."
5,Reed and Winner are a winning combination,"As with their collaborations on ""The Girl Getters"" and ""The Jokers"", the efforts of director Michael Winner and actor Oliver Reed are effective in this fast-paced, quick-witted work. Like the ultimate relationship comedy ""Annie Hall"", this film revolves around the same subject matter a decade earlier. This time, viewers see Andrew Quint, who becomes as disenchanted with his successful advertising career as he is with his team of mistresses. At 32, he is ready to begin again. But as he changes jobs and women, he also encounters a few life changes he had not planned on. Set in London's swinging sixties, this movie captures the setting with style and marks one of Reed's very finest performances. A must-see!"
3,Frustrating to set up,"This was a Christmas present for my 9 year old daughter. She liked it a lot. The loom is fun to use, and the booklet has detailed instructions. However, the included yarn is a huge mess. Instead of packaging it as easy to use balls of yarn, they put it in twisted skeins. I don't know what the idea is here, but before starting on any weaving project, you have to roll up the yarn into a usable shape. Needless to say, for the inexperienced user this is a mess waiting to happen. I ended up frustrated with an entangled unusable mess of yarn. My advice is skip this step and use store bought ""user friendly"" yarn. Of course, if you can't use the included yarn which is pretty and colorful, the price does not seem quite justified. Maybe this is easier when you have some experience in textile crafts such as knitting. But because of this needless complication, I am not giving this product a high rating."
4,Works great!,This drive was ordered to restore a RAID array in which one of the drives had failed. Worked great! Shipping was fast and product was as advertised.
2,Expect it to die a little before the phone does,"When I first bought the phone, I read the scathing review below this one on Amazon and was almost scared off, but naturally it was such a good deal, I bought it anyhow. I was pleased to find that the closing mechanism was not blocked and found it to work well, at least for the time being.Fast-forward to 1 1/2 years later: I haven't abused the phone, but the Body Glove is cracked and broken and the aforementioned closing problem is now evident. It would even rapidly switch between open and closed, forcing me to disable the ""answer calls on cell phone open"" feature so it didn't answer phone calls and then immediately hang up on them. It didn't help that this 'protection' did not prevent the 8200's hinge from breaking, either. Both the phone and the case will eventually fall apart; don't buy either."
4,Well built and comfortable but pricey,"I have used several slings myself and purchased this one as a gift. The recipient chose, allowing me the opportunity to get my hands on this ""premium"" sling. The stretch and quality of the fabric is wonderful, the print is prettier in person and this sling is well constructed. The little bit of padding for legs is a nice touch and not too bulky. I am giving it a four because of the price. It's a great sling but $60??? You can buy two for that price elsewhere without sacrificing much, if any, quality. In the end, though, slings are the best baby item you can own so sling on!"
3,Try one on before you buy,"This is really a great product. If your baby likes it.My baby is 4 weeks old and I have tried her in it at least once a day, and she only screams when I put her in it. I'm not sure if I have the wrong size (I actually did try one on prior to purchase, I think I have the correct size...). Not sure if she's too tight in it, or just doesn't like the position she's in when she's in it.All in all, I have talked to other mom's who's babies have loved them, my only advice is that the product is a little expensive, and if your baby doesn't like it, $$ down the drain. Wait until your baby arrives and try them in it before you buy."
3,"Carry your baby, hands free!","Hotslings Baby Carrier Sweet Pea Size 3I bought this sling thinking that I could get more done around the house with a hands free baby carrying device. I wanted her head to poke out so she could look around the house. This sling is perfect for just that, and can be worn in a few different positions. If I want her to sleep in it I can tuck her in so she barely sticks out, but as she grows she can sit up and take a peek around the room. The sling came with not only a brochure but a how to cd. I found the cd very helpful.Keep in mind while buying, it may be hands free but you must be careful when contemplating how to pick something off the ground. Another thing to think about is that you are wearing your baby on your belly/ hip, so be careful you don't bump into anything. For better mobility and a tighter fit a bjorn type baby pack might be better."
5,Awesome!,My niece is very interested in eagles and when I handed her this little guy she freaked! She loved it! Very noble looking and very soft.
5,Witty and imaginative,This page turner has a bit of everything in it. It's a fun read with some crazy twists and turns along the way. Interesting plot with an unexpected ending. Anyone from the northwest can appreciate the local sarcasm and humor buried between the lines!
3,"What is ""Somoan?""","I hope the title of this book is a joke because if it is a reference to the tropical islands in the Pacific that would be S-A-M-O-A-N and I really can't find anything that says this is one of those words with optional spellings. It may be a common mistake but that's no excuse.I mean the spelling here in Idaho is atrocious. You'll get more English accuracy from a Chinatown menu than from a lot of local government documents. If Bo is ""riffing off"" that then I'm already laughing. Otherwise, I'm hard pressed to spend good coin on something that starts off on such a bad foot.Correct me if I'm wrong...please."
2,painfully bad,"I've been listening to Odetta occasionally for 35 years now, and I'm amazed how bad the music is. She's a triple-threat: can't sing, can't play the guitar, and has not a scrap of understanding of most of the songs. Her reputation is based on glowing second-hand reports from other 60's folkies. If you want to hear these songs performed with passion and skill, buy Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, or Mahalia Jackson's Greatest Hits. Odetta is strictly for crazy hippie-girl fanatics."
3,Interesting but a Tad Repetetive,"I love and have read a number of books of this sort, and while not being a bad example of the short article fact book format, it did tend to get a little repetetive. The three to four page segments are written by different people so some of the pieces tend to overlap with the same information from one segment to the next. Also, I had read most of the ""good idea turned bad"" information in other books of this type (usually with more conciseness) so there weren't many surprises.The reading is quick and light and fun, so if you aren't familiar with the ""this is what REALLY happened"" branch of literature, you may enjoy this quite a bit. Otherwise, I would suggest one stick with broader and more interesting works like ""An Underground Education"" by Richard Zacks which covers a number of the same points found in this work as well as branching out into many other arenas of human stupidity."
3,"well, not a bad idea...","A pot pourri of fiascoes and mistakes, mostly political and military, from Ancient Greece to the Gulf War, written up in short chapters mostly by the two editors, but with a couple of other contributors. Not bad, although the short treatments inevitably simplify history. The well-known examples (eg. Pearl Harbour) are uninteresting, but most people will learn something new from the others. Quite good historical light-entertainment, although marred by some typos. Overall: glad i bought it, it whiled away a couple of evenings on vacation."
2,"Good read, but . . .","This is a good book to sit by your bedside to read a short chapter before going to sleep. I like this kind of book format; however, some stories will leave you wondering about the sanity of the very authors themselves. For example, there was a reference that the famous ""John Wayne"" was an active participant at the Alamo. I read the paragraph in which this occurred several times and decided that the author was just making an intellectual joke . . . but I speculate that the reader 100 or so years from now may think that the author was a complete idiot that only learned history from made-for-tv movies. Another author belittled the human cost of the plague in 1300s Europe by stating that it ONLY affected 3 out of 4 people. You may have purchased the book to discover some history, but you are also discovering something about how people interpret history as well. Although this book is easy reading in a short-story format, maybe the bedside table isn't the right place for it?"
4,A great lyricist,"Kurupt is the overall best rapper of Tha Dogg Pound. He has the best lyrical skills. I think the production on ""Kuruption!"" was a little unbalanced. The Daz Dillinger-produced tracks are the best ones. And guest production by Dr. Dre, that's good. REAL good.Kurupt is one of the best MC's of all time. I've been down with him ever since I heard him on ""The Chronic"" and ""Doggystyle"".The West coast-disc was the best of the two CD's on ""Kuruption!"". Kurupt sounds like he should do on it. The East coast-disc is not that good, a couple of songs, but not all of them.If you're into Kurupt, you gotta have this album. He deserves 5 stars for his lyrical skills alone. However, the somewhat uneven production on this album reduces the rating to 4 stars."
4,Much better than I expected.,"I think that the seperate West Coast and East Coast CDs was a good idea because it kept the album sounding fresh. The West Coast disc was more entertaining, but the East Coast CD had good cuts also. Kupurt has good flow, but who in the hell are these other guys on here? My favorite tracks were: West Coast- ""This One's For U"", ""Make Some Noize"", ""We Can Freak It"", ""Fresh"", ""C-Walk"", ""Can't Let That Slide"", and ""Ask Yourself a Question""(which was produced by Dr.Dre). East Coast- ""It's A Set Up"", ""Light S*** Up"", ""Gimmewhutchagot"", ""No Feelings"", and ""We Can Freak it Out (remix)"" featuring Noreaga. Overall, this one is worth the up to 20 beans you may have to shell out for it."
3,Kuruption!,"Kurupt's debut record as a solo recording artist, not a shabby beginning. A little disappointed due to lack of 'west coast' beats. But such songs as 'Ho's A Housewife', 'We Can Freak It' (and the remix), 'C-Walk', and 'Gimmewhutchagot' make up for it. This album features rappers such as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Soopafly, Tray Deee, Warren G, and various others. Good CD, i'd definietly recommend it. Great Dogg Pound Product, just like all others! DPG!"
2,Not What i Xpected,"I couldn't wait to buy this album when it came out. Now, i wish i wouldnt have bought it. It's got a few hot joints like ""We Can Freak It,"" ""Light Sh*t Up,"" and ""Fresh"" but lacks the DPG beats and Kurupt's battle flow on Dogg Food. No longer preoccupied with murderin MC'z, Kurupt changes his style and no longer sounds like the Rakim disciple he used to be in his Death Row dayz."
4,Kuruption!,"Kurupt has got to be one of my favorite rappers ever, from his start on The Chronic, to his appearances on Doggystyle all the way to the Dogg Food album, he has never dissapointed once. I like this cd alot, mostly the West Coast side which has the biggest hits like ""We Can Freak It"" ""Fresh"" ""C-Walk"" ""Put That On Something"" ""Can't Let That Slide"" ""This One's For U"" ""That's Gangsta"" and ""Make Some Noize"" it is just mint. The East Coast side is where i start to have problems, where the songs mostly just are kinda average, to the point of bad. Kuruption seems like Kurupt is a little out of his element, cause you don't see Daz rapping once with him, he has a lot of no-name guests from Antra, and a couple others like Tray-Dee, Buckshot, Slip Capone, Noreaga, Dr.Dre & Baby S. He made a strong comeback on Tha Streetz Iz A Mutha, so a little experimentation isn't really that bad. Go Get This."
5,Kurupt is so fine!,"Whenever I see him, he makes me lick my lips! I love the album too, baby. ""C-Walk"" is the best track. Kurupt you are so fine! If I was alone with you, we'd, well, you know...."
4,Surprisingly dope.,"When I first got this joint I was like, yeah yeah, some more bullsh*t gangsta rap, but after listening to it I was really took back. This sh*t ain't bad at all, mad heads are gonna be surprised by this double LP. Basically disc 1 is the west coast sh*t, and disc 2 is the east coast sh*t, cause I hope ya'll know that Kurupt is from my hometown, Philly. I mean I can't sit here and say I liked every song, because I damn sure didn't, but you take the good with the bad, on the average I'd have to say that the east coast joint is dope, with Buckshot connecting on ""Light Sh*t Up"", and Noreaga doing his thing on ""We Can Freak It Out (remix)"". It's a well produced album, with heads like Easy Mo Bee, Battlecat, Studiotone, and Daz coming though on the production tip. On the real though, I know alot of people think Kurupt is wack, but give this joint a chance, you will be surprised by what you hear."
3,Yearly Tradition,"This is the second time I have purchased Sta-bil off amazon. Its just really convenient to order it from amazon for me. I only gave this 3 stars because the 1st bottle I ordered came with a expiration date that had just passed... still did the trick tho, but I didnt feel comfortable using the left over in the bike this year so I ordered another. I`ll order again when needed and would recommend this to others."
3,"Interesting, but unsatisfying","Interesting whodunnit story of two girls hitchhiking. Once you start it, you'll want to finish it, but it wasn't very entertaining. No characters I really liked much. Fans of slow paced, clever stories may enjoy this one."
4,"5 is for great, 4 is for darn good","And this is darn good. There are unfortunately all kind of Solomon samplers around, with lots of duplication. This, however, is two LPs packed into one CD, with the strengths and weaknesses of those old LPs. The good songs are plenty, and very very very good. The weak ones, ah, well.....Solomon has a sensational voice, and the arrangements on most of these really shine. Even a bad song sounds good when he does it. But there is just too much filler on these to give it 5.However, 23 songs is great value. Way too many of these re-releases just slap an LP (and many of them were short back then--10 2-3 minute songs) on a CD. But this gives you plenty to pick and choose from. And the sound quality is good as well, background vocals are clear, that 60's organ pops and Solomon's voice is balanced quite well. A very good re-release."
4,"okay performance, but too big and too industrial in looks","I have only had this microwave for one day. So far, it performs some duties well. It heats up water, warms up food. However, it just makes my kitchen look like a machine shop. It is so darn huge. Why does it have to be so darn big? It takes up the entire depth of my counter. Our old one was only 12 inches deep, I made the mistake of letting my husband pick one. Who knew that microwaves were built this huge. I like the performance so far. I just wish that it did not ruin the charm of my kitchen. I still am not talking to my husband because he refuses to return this microwave, he wants to remodel based on this microwave. If you ever decide to get this model, make sure that it fits your kitchen style. Kitchens do not come cheap nowadays."
4,This was one great book,"This book was an incredible book. It was so good. I think that every one should read this one too. Its about Sabrina getting a witches virus called spellfuse and it is where she snezzes and her powers pop out of her and into another person. Well while she is near Libby she snezzes and it does not take long for Libby to figure it out, and all she wants is more of even if it means taking Drell's powers!!"
4,You Must Read This Book!,I loved this book and I could not put it down. All though as you got to the ending you could predict what was going to happen but it was the best!!!
5,Lauren Rosier,I think this book was fantastic!!!!! I have almost all these books in this series. I love them!!!!!
5,"Hey, this was fun!","When Sabrina catches a twenty-four hour virus called Spellfluenza, her powers transfer to the nearest mortal - Libby, Westbridge High's richest and snobbiest person! When Libby realizes her magical powers, she wants nothing less than global domination. Therefore, she makes a plan to steal the powers of Drell, head of the Witches' Council. Once done, Sabrina, her aunts, Salem, and a now mortal Drell must pass three tests or the universe will become one big shopping mall dedicated to Libby!***** I was enchanted immediately! I found myself giggling aloud at some points and committing unladylike LOUD laughter at others! Don't miss out on this one! ****"
4,Oh yeah! Thats what Im talking about,"A series thats been running this long, and still mantaining its popularity, is definetly worth seeing. However, I myself am a little dissapointed in where this show is headed. I mean sure its nice to have some intrigue, but this show has way too much. Remember what happened to Evangelion? I just wanna see a show about a crew of misfits chasing down bounty hunters. That alone would of been just fine for me. Oh well. Somethings about Bebop however will still remain the same. Like the fact that this kinda music cant be beat and the action is intense, if not frantic. So, if your willing to stay with a series this good, I recommend you buy this tape also. After I saw this tape, Im a little more hopeful, but lets see some more action and less intrigue."
3,A little small,"This 6.5"" squirrel seems a little smaller than I expected even with the size description but it will make a great stocking stuffer item."
5,Cute,"If you like squirrels and stuffed animals, you will then like this little guy. Lifelike and quality construction. Good stuffing and holds up to wear."
5,Great soundtrack!,"I liked the music from this CD. The best song of them all was ""God Help the Outcasts Bette Midler."""
5,Delightful music!,"The movie adaptation of this classic story was done so well by Disney (as if that would be a surprise to those of us that love Disney)...it stands to reason that the music would be fantastic as well. The original scores are so easy to learn and sing...I play this in the car almost daily for my children and we love to sing along. The music is moving to adults, and fun for children. I am sure that some of the concepts are lost on my little ones, but I know that they will come to learn the meaningful message this movie portrays soon enough. Right now they just love Quasi and Esmerelda. Quasi is a lovable character, but certainly not much to look at, which is why I love him so much. It shows that beauty is certainly the most vivid when we view it from within. What a wonderful message to send to our children in this world today, when looks and money seem to matter so much and the virtues mean so little."
4,Menken's music deserves better lyrics,"I thought the soundtrack suffered from some of the same problems as the movie did - too in-your-face politically correct! Yes, it's great to help the poor and outcast, but I thought that the way Stephen Schwartz went about it made the lyrics seem artificial and insincere. Subtlety would have been better. But Menken did very well with this soundtrack - his best since Beauty and the Beast."
3,"Good Music, but....","THIS IS NOT AT ALL THE REAL STORY. This is a ""Disneyfied"" version of this story. In the real version, Pheobus has a wife, Frollo is a Priest not a judge, the narrator is not Clopin but Gringoire, and Esmerelda and Quasimodo both die. But its Disney, and the music is fun. Especially the amazing vocals of the man singing Clopin. WOW!"
4,And my brunt brain would not accept my thinker. No kiddin'.,"Okay, I know what you're thinking. Ambrosia? AMBROSIA?Take it from someone who's taste runs to the Residents and Kraftwerk and Aphex Twin and Orbital and Beastie Boys and Gorecki and bluegrass....this is a record you should have.The song ""Dance with me George"" is a hoot and a holler and one of the strangest marriages of ""rock"" and ""classical"" ever committed to vinyl. And then you have the spare, simple beauty of ""Harvey.""This is one for the ages. Get it, and smile."
2,big disappointment,"I am a big fan of Ambrosia's self titled album, which I have held in esteem for nearly thirty years. Naturally I figured a broader sampling of their music was in order. unfortunatley, reviews given by devoted listeners can be over enthusiastic, and I got sucked into believing them. I may try to listen to ""Somehere I've Never Travelled"" one or two more times in the future but it doesn't hold a candle to their first."
2,A letdown after terrific debut.,"Alan Parsons over-produced this sophmore effort by the California based Ambrosia to the extent that it sounds more like the Alan Parsons' Project than a follow-up to the band's solid debut. The compositions are no where near as compelling as the previous effort and their terrific musicianship is never brought out in the mix. It was all downhill from here as efforts following this one slipped into the realm of pop-music. A shame as this outfit had great promise. Pick up the self-titled debut, give this one a skip...Simon"
4,Feel good prog,"Ambrosia had all the tools to be an American version of Yes and Pink Floyd rolled into one amazing band.Take one part Copeland,one part Chopin,a smattering of Pink Floyd,the Beatles,Alan Parsons Project,and a chunk of Frank Zappa,fuse it together and voila ,Ambrosia.This is their last album that was any good,anything after just sucked.I wish they hadn't sold out and gone over to the dark side of the Hollywood hit machine.What a waste of talent!"
4,Very Complex,"I have loved Ambrosia since they first came out and I love this album. I am, however, rating this for YOU and I can't honestly say it is as brilliant as their first album, ""Ambrosia."" This album does have it's great moments. If you like a style similar to ""Yes,"" this album is in that genre. It is innovative and uses original instruments probably not found on any other album. On it's own merit it is a great album. If you judge it by their debut album you may not enjoy it as much."
5,Lively reading with many creative ideas.,"Enjoyed the book immensely. Highly spirited book with many creative ideas to create excitement, energy and bonding in the workplace. Seemed to spur on creative thoughts within those who read it to come up with new ideas themselves or twists on suggested ideas."
4,"A great resource for improving morale-ultimately, retention.","Weinstein provides numerous examples of ways to improve the office environment. More importantly, he stimulates the reader to create their own fun and creative ways of rewarding and motivating their subordinates and peers. This is a must read for anyone who truly cares about their subordinates."
2,Disappointing,"Sorry, but this does not meet expectations, especially after you read all these good reviews. The book is not very well written, a lot of ideas are just not funny, many should not be implemented unless you want to get fired and the few good ideas can only be followed by company owners. I don't know if its cultural differences that count here (I'm in Greece), but I think this book is not good even for US residents.I would give more stars if many ideas were taken out, the rest were better written and the price was lower.One more thing: several real-life examples do not seem so real-life to me. I have a strong feeling that these are ""engineered"" to fit in the book...The two stars are for the first part of the book, not the specific ideas."
2,agree with 2 star rating,"yea, i hate to give not so great reviews, but unfortunately i guess i was expecting some REALLY innovative ideas in this book. don't get me wrong, if you're starting from square 1, there's some concepts in here you can probably implement, but overall, i just wasn't blown away by this book. (perhaps i just had set too high of expectations based on the title. i tend to find that with many books: the title looks so great, but the content is just so-so)also, keep in mind, the book was written over 10 years ago (not saying that old ideas can't still work), but some ideas just seem outdated (maybe a revised version with updates is needed?)i just ordered another book along these lines. i'll post its review after reading.if anyone has read any other 'how to have fun at work' type books, let me know"
2,Tough going but does reveal the history of Arrows & Disney,"Not an easy book to read this - even if you're a big fan of theme park rides and Disney you're going find it hard going. The gramma and writing can be truly awful at times, particularly at the beginning. A few black and white photographs are of interest - Walt testing some eary ride designs (grinning from ear to ear!) and stories recounted by the great Ed Morgan and Karl Bacon are interesting but I must admit to being a little disappointed, and that's mainly down to the presentation. An editor would have been a good idea - or proof-reader maybe? It feels like the book was written in a couple of days from interviews of Bacon & Morgan, then printed. No tidying, editing and little structure, which is a great shame because this is an important historical subject. There's some good stuff in there but I suspect you'll have ripped all your hair out by the time you get to it..."
5,Fantastic Review of Disneyland History,"A fascinating journey down the road that led to the ""Happiest Place on Earth"". The story of Ed Morgan and Karl Bacon has been fittingly retold, and the end result documents their 20 year relationship with Walt Disney and what became known to us all as Disneyland. Somewhat homespun (needs a bit more editing and proofreading)... but don't let that stop you. This book is essential for any student of Walt Disney's greatest accomplishment. Includes their reknowned work at dozens more amusement parks around the world. Includes some great photos. Thanks to author Robert Reynolds for a fantastic insider's look at the creation of Disneyland."
2,"A few crumbs, poorly presented","This book is badly written, in need of an editor and suffers from poor design. There is enough interesting material here for an extended magazine article and that is more or less how the book reads. It's too bad that the book is so poorly presented because the topic is potentially fascinating and the Arrow group is more than deserving, but this slapdash, amatuer effort has the quality of a fanzine--lots of eanest loving prose and precious little skill. For Disney fanatics only."
1,point/counterpoint,I was disappointed in the book overall. I was looking for a book teaching how to write musical composition in counterpoint. This book had nothing to do with that subject. Some of the content of the book also denigrates the Christian faith.
4,sink protector - rubbermaid,it does what it is intended for black over the white looks better longer
1,"Good idea, poor quality...","I ordered this item on March 5, 2012 and noticed small rust spots in my sink today. Upon inspecting the sink protector, I found that there is rust where the metal grates are welded to the frame. I'm not sure which is worse - the scratches I got in my sink prior to purchasing this item or the rust spots that this so-called sink protector left behind. Even at its reasonable price, I would have expected to have gotten more than 10 days of use out of it."
3,Why can't they find a better way??,This is a better product than others but of course way too small for most sinks. Also I have had this for about 2 weeks and the metal has already pulled out of the plastic. So I would say its better than the slimmy old school plastic ones but it still doesn't do what it should. It's just so so..
2,Hated them,Rigid. Didn't fit the sink well. Steel grid may protect the sink bottom but not fragile china or glassware.I was going to throw them away but the cleaning lady took them.Replaced them with the OXO ones - MUCH better!!
2,"Looks good, doesn't stay together","this mat would appear to be a good idea, but it doesn't actually work. The plastic notches on the outer frame holding the metal in place stretch out after a little use and the entire thing comes apart. Not worth the $."
3,Looks Sharp! Need to work on comfort.,Really sharp looking and comes with a shine you could see yourself in reflection. Got lots of compliments from this for a formal event. It is a trues size fit wearing a 9.5.Needs a good break-in period if you want to dance with it. Wish they had cushion around the edge as I felt it dig in to my ankles a bit while dancing. Maybe it will get better on a couple more events.
2,disappointed,I have owned several pair of Stacy Adams shoes and have been pleased with all of them until now. These particular shoes seemed cheaply put together and not made of a very good material. The shoes did not fit true to size in my opinion and I had to send them back because they were too small.
5,People Feed Back,"This is a sparkling shoe. It appears that every time I step out with these shoes on, several people notice and say how great those shoes look!"
1,Shock of Horrors!,The shoes had the following defects:1. Dark stain on the front of the shoe... supposed to be brand NEW!2. Inside sole ripped.... look like someone had already worn it3. General maunfacture of the shoe was very POOR.Do not waste your money on this item.
3,Quality is Lacking!,My son was thrilled with these shoes but we were dissapointed in the stitching around the shoe. Some areas do not match up and there is a gap of white where there shouldn't be.
1,Horribly Crafted,"I bought this futon from a local furniture store and within 6 months the front two beams of the frame severed completely at the glue-joints. The futon looks nice, I'll have to give them that, but that's all they have going for them. So far it does not seem the manufacturer holds up to their ""10 year warranty"". I will never buy a Coaster product EVER again due to their shoddy craftsmanship. I'd be better off with cinderblocks and 2x4's, or a walmart $100 futon for that matter.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Some Great Cuts,"If you want the actual music used in the rides and attractions, buy one of the official WDW albums. These are Disney song covers by a variety of artists. Etta James makes ""It's a Small World"" meaningful and beautiful, Tim Curry has his tongue planted firmly in cheek in ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett,"" and Take 6's lush accapella harmonies are outstanding on ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" As another reviewer said, David Benoit's ""Spectromagic Medley"" shimmers like the parade itself. Linda Rondstadt and Olivia Newton-John sing pretty straight-forward versions of familiar tunes, and Brian McKnight's sentimental ""Remember the Magic,"" used in Disney World advertising, might bring a tear to your eye."
2,False advertising in the title,"I bought this C.D because I wanted ""Music from the Park"" not remakes of the true music that is in Walt Disney World. I was very disapointed when I started listening to the songs. A couple of years later I found the true music from the park called ""Where magic lives, The official album from Walt Disney World"". I bought it at Downtown Disney in Orlando but I'm not sure if it's available other places outside the park. The closest album available for sale here on amazon.com is ""Walt Disney World Resort in Florida"". It has almost all of the songs my CD has plus a few more. If you love the true music from the park I'd recommend one of these other CD's."
1,Not worth getting!,This CD is defintely not worth buying. The only track worth anything is the Grim Grinning Ghosts. The pirate song was done by the Pointer Sisters & the other songs were equally mangled. I think it's a disaster & would say don't buy it!
3,"Hilarious, But Awful","The music is horribly dated. Also, overkill on keyboards and some REALLY bad lounge singing. However, this thing is comedy GOLD! I nearly DIED laughing at Tim Curry's rendition of The Ballad of Davy Crockett. It's even better when you think that Tim Curry actually had to practice that and go into a studio and record it. Poor guy. The only song here that sounds a lot like the original is Remember the Magic, because I think that was the original? NOT a good park CD, but a FIVE STAR comedy CD."
2,What were they thinking?,"Very disappointing CD, obviously catering to some specific audience only. Nothing worthwhile until track 8. Then, I have to admit, the CD is excellent. If you're willing to spend the money for 1/2 a CD then go for it. The music after track 7 has some of my fondest memories of the park wrapped up in it. Unfortunately, tracks 1-7 turned me off so badly that I didn't even GET to tracks 8 and up until a year after I bought the CD originally!"
2,Not what I expected,"I love Disney theme park music and thought this was what I was buying, I was disappointed as it is cover versions and too jingle music for me not actual parks music.."
2,horrid and misleading,"I'm so happy that I was lucky enough to find this at the local thrift store for 5 cents cd only. I was born and raised in Anaheim CA so I always loved Disney. From the title I really thought it was the original songs, but alas it was not. For 5 cents I'm not gonna do much complaining, but I feel bad for the others who bought it at full price expecting something else. Avoid this if you want to hear the original songs from Disney."
2,Basically just for Collectors,"I bought this CD because I'm a big POINTER SISTERS fan and wanted their one song on here to complete my collection. I enjoy their song, and I view this CD as basically one for die hard fans to complete their discographies of the recording artists who are on this CD. Fans of OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN, LINDA RONSTADT, BARENAKED LADIES, POINTER SISTERS, PATTI AUSTIN , and the rest will probably just want their one song each just for their collection. I'm not a big fan of Disney songs. This CD is okay, not great. Probably the biggest goof is TIM CURRY doing THE BALLAD OF DAVY CROCKETT. He intentionally mocks the song with ad-libs & lines not in the original version. Surprising how they actually put it on this CD. I guess Disney purists will not like the new arrangements of most of these songs. Just for die-hards & completists, in my opinion."
3,Stimulating and provocative,"[Originally published in 1889] "". . . the book provides a fascinating example of an early examination of an artform which, as he noted then, 'is usually touched on only briefly in works of aesthetics.' . . . Despite the outmoded understanding of physiology, the book serves as a stimulating and provocative treatise on the underpinnings of our appreciation and understanding of human movement."" -- from my review for the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Vol. 43 (Summer 1985), pp. 409-410."
3,"Great Story, Improbable Ending","The rich, spoiled, dandy son of the shipowner gets pressed into service on one of his father's ship and is forced to labor as a common seaman and to make the trip around the Horn. He endures a flogging and shares in other brutalities inflicted on the crew, including lack of proper food, disease, and other mistreatment. Eventually, the crew mutinies, but decides to return to Boston to face justice and to plead the cause of the mistreated sailors in the merchant marine. Only trouble is . . . the ending is highly improbable."
2,Dragged a lot,"For some reason, this book seemed to take forever to read. It just doesn't get that exciting. A solid tale of a hard working kid that worked his way to greatness, but you won't be sprinting through the pages. Nothing to get excited about."
1,Aaron Burr Is Slimed Again,"In essence, Alan Clark's book is one big gossip column. The only difference between his work and those of other gossip mongers in our nation's periodicals is that the latter know how to write a coherent sentence, properly punctuated and generally void of misspellings. Of course, they must submit to the discipline of editors and they usually write for reputable publishers who demand that quotations be checked, that facts be accurate and that documentation be provided. Clark does not concern himself with any of these things. His book is a self-published, printed-on-demand product, a growing part of the ""listen to me"" industry that also includes personal websites known as blogs."
4,Great Faucet for the price,"After two attempts with a cheaper American Standard faucet, I decided to purchase this American made Kohler. It is high quality. It is mostly all metal (brass, chrome, etc.) For the $125 I paid, this is really a nice product. Installation was simple - less than 30 minutes; the pullout is very easy (American Std was always sticking and hard to pull out); water pressure is good; the turn of the faucet is about 180 degrees.Recommended if you want a good product on a small budget."
5,Very nice,We just finished remodeling our kitchen. This faucet is just so pretty with everything else. The pull-out spray is great and I love the two spray options. This was better than anything we saw in any store.
2,Junk,Slow flow on non-spray and spray mode is so so. Disappointed in the performance. At least it matches the sinks color nicely. Without that it would be a zero.
4,We Love It.,"My husband and I both like this faucet very much. It matches almost perfectly the ceramic deck on which it sets. It operates just as advertised but this being our second Kohler in about 18 months, we felt sure it would. They are hard to beat."
3,Short Supply lines and unimpressed water flow,The supply lines were too short and needed extensions lines installed. The water flow from the faucet wasn't as strong as I would like.
4,Nice but too expensive,Pros:Very light lever.Pretty easy to install. (Did it myself)Cons:I think it's too expensive but I had to buy it to match with my sink. My old one is almost the same as this one but broken after eight years of use.
3,Very short,I can't wait for the third to come out. the second was way too short and it takes so long for the seasons to be available to buy!
4,Wildfire S02: DVD,"Not personally my favorite season but definitely a great series. Must watch from the beginning, it has a great story line and the seasons only get better and end with a bang! Top series, definitely."
5,"Love Horses, Love Wildfire","My daughter loves this show. If you are a horse lover, then your daughter will love this show. It definitely is a show for age 13 and older because of some romantic scenes. The product arrived in great condition within one week."
1,Trico 46-180 Twin Rail Refill - 455mm (1 Refill),Bought a pair of these for one of my cars.I was trying to cheap out by getting these refills. Big mistake.Hard to install. Too loose. Falls out from the wiper frame/holder.I ended up buying the whole wiper blade assembly from Costco.
5,It's Bebop--what else can be said?,"Yes, some people have given this DVD lower ratings, but I think it really does deserve a 5. While some of the episodes aren't as memorable as other Cowboy Bebop episodes, on their own they are quite good. Especially ""Cowboy Funk."" The DVD is worth it just for that one episode, which is (in my opinion) the best humorous episode in the entire series. And none of the episodes are what could be described as ""bad."" One (Boogie-Woogie Feng Shui) delves a little bit into Jet's history, even. But, if you're reading this review, you've most likely bought the rest of the series, so I doubt you need me to tell you to buy this one, as well. It's a nice build-up before the huge finale."
4,Entertaining and rich,"Cowboy Bebop combines the classic Wild West with what was best about the 70s. What was best about the 70s, you ask? Ok, not much, but listen to the soundtrack to Cowboy Bebop and you'll know what I mean. The intro animation itself is reminiscent of something close to Charlie's Angels.Muscle car and Soul Train references aside, Cowboy Bebop is one of the most richly animated series I've ever seen. It balances serious plots with humorous ones and sometimes combines the two for an enhanced effect.My only complaint is that I would have liked to witness more episodes detailing Spike's past with Julia. There just isn't enough of that story, the one that interests me the most.But there must be something about this series that never leaves my mind. Sometimes I find myself speaking the words ""Bloody Eye"" out loud for no particular reason in that broken Japanese rendition of English."
3,"All Style, Not Much Story/Substance","The entire Cowboy Bebop series has some of the most well-integrated music/animation/character styles I've seen (the operative word here is great STYLE), but there isn't much of a story. The characters are flat enough that I find myself wanting to know about the history of the technology (like the engineering of the star gates) or to delve more into the development of all those extra-terrestial cities.I personally think this series is worth renting, but if you are considering collecting the series, I highly recommend that you see it for yourself first and then decide whether or not you prefer all style over story. [BTW, ""Pierrot le fou"" on the 5th DVD was one of the best episodes in the series - the flashes of Pierrot's background were enough to make me feel sorry for the guy...]Throughout most of the series, I often find myself having a hard time recollecting what I just watched one or two episodes back.Rent before you buy..."
2,Cowboy Bebop = Way Overrated,"Sheesh, in every episode of Cowboy Bebop the animators of the series congratulate themselves on how groundbreaking and original their series is. Well, I hate to break it to you, but the series isn't that original or groundbreaking. Many old anime genres and plots are copied and the series itself never really progresses anywhere at all... the characters are barely delved into w/ any depth and as the series goes on the stories get thinner and thinner. The best episode by far is the first, having some pretty cool action scenes, but after that what little action there is is pretty lame. The best character in the series is a quirky little hacker genius named Ed. The episodes w/ Ed are worth watching.What probably most soured me on the series is the unbelievably lame ending. The cheese oozing out of the last few episodes actually angered me more than entertained. I tried to forget as quickly as possible what I had just seen, it was so stupid."
5,not for everybody,"These books are not for everybody.I would go there only if you are able to think beyond the box.For people who do not like how things are going in our culture,who know something is not right with our way of life. Very mind blowing books!"
2,Bla bla bla,"No comparison with book one. It is mostly about Megre's personal life. It is as if he said everything he has to say in book one and has no more, so he fills the pages with a lot of bla bla.... (we are not interested in). It is boring.. but you keep on reading hoping to find something new, but nothing. The last chapters are a repitation of book one."
5,life changing book,"The books in this series are so good that the people I've lent them to have ordered their own copies, knowing that they would want to read them again (and again). They are books that you want to live with; they are books you want to live. After reading the ringing cedars series life can never be the same. Book 2 follows the skeptic's journey back into city life, where he asks all the questions the first book may have left you with...and proceeds to answer them."
1,Do not read the translation with the black cover,"I am writing this as an avid fan and supporter of the Anastasia series, but please do not read the translation that is in the Black Covered books. The encoded language that Anastasia uses in the books has been distorted in these versions. If you want the true, authentic language order the books that have green covers. These black cover books are another method used by the powers that be to distort the truth and keep everything ""in the dark."""
5,One Of My All Time Favorite CDs,This CD by Ambrosia is in my top ten albums of all time. It is truly brilliant fromstart to finish. It is a must have for anyone who likes great creative art rock songs.The mix by Alan Parsons is amazing. Just a wonderful collection of songs.
5,Awesome,"One of the best albums of all time, debut or otherwise. Somewhere I've Never Travelledand Life Beyond LA are also near the top of my list.Just get them! If you're a musician, you'll appreciate them even more.."
3,Pleasant early progressive album,"This is one of those albums that will evoke an emotional but irrational response. People who grew up listening to this album will say this is the greatest album ever. And it is a very good album, it's just not that great. There isn't a bad song on the album, but none them are perfect. Even the fantastic classic, Nice, Nice, Very Nice (words by Kurt Vonnegut) has a bad instrumental interlude in the middle.This is early progressive rock. It is softer and more pop-ish than most. But most of the music and singing are very good and it never gets into the overblown excesses of many later progressive albums (except for the reading of the poem Jabberwocky). It is very pleasant to listen to from start to end. I don't know, maybe it does deserve 4 stars. My low rating may just be an emotional and irrational response."
1,this music is weird,"I like songs like the ones the MONKEES sing. If you are like me and you like bands like the ARCHIES and 1910 FRUITGUM COMPANY, then chances are you won't like this weird AMBROSIA MUSIC."
1,Poor build quality...,"I can't comment on the ability of this battery to hold a charge - I just put it into my phone (it does hold A charge...question is, how long?).However, the package arrived already opened (maybe an issue with the vendor) AND the battery itself was put together very poorly compared to the phone's original.When I first installed this new battery, the back of my phone barely closed, and had a visible bulge because the battery isn't constructed with much attention to detail. I stripped off a layer of labeling material and the battery now fits OK. However, it still has some bulging material visible and doesn't fit as well as the original.I didn't see too many options on Amazon for a replacement battery for my 8525 - I didn't want the bulge of an extended battery. But I would gladly pay more money for something that inspires more confidence and doesn't require surgery to fit in the phone."
4,As good as original for Sprint PPC6700,"I've been using this battery since receiving it 3 months ago, and I detect no difference in its performance vs. the original UTStarcom-branded model BTR6700 I received when I bought the phone over a year ago. I give it 4 our of 5 on the theory that if it performed in a manner superior to the original, it would deserve 5 stars; since it is in all ways equivalent, I give it 4."
3,Average Quality Battery,"This battery was of average quality. For the first year, this battery would power my phone (a Cingular 8525) for about 48 hours before dropping to 10% charge. After that, it would power the phone for about 36 hours under the same condition."
2,BANZAI aqua splash beach ball,"easy to set up. needed and extra hose washer/seal. the package indicated it fly's around on its own so i figured the water pressure would cause this.there is a kid on the back of the box with a exclamation bubble saying ""it bounces everywhere!"" not so, no such thing. its just a ball the squirts water. the kids must throw it around. glad i only paid 6 bucks at dollar general. the kids are having fun all the same. i was the one who was/ is disappointed that it didnt live up the outside packaging. but for 6 bucks...."
1,fell apart in 1st 5 minutes,The ball does NOT hold up! the hose popped off of the ball in the 1st 5 minutes my kids were playing with it! WASTE of money!
2,eh,"It was pretty boring, but an awesome book to do for a book review. Haha only because it was like only one hundred pages."
5,Why isn't Brian Gari more famous?,"If I were a woman, I'd want Brain Gari to be writing songs about me. His turns of phrase, his ability to take a few notes and evoke feelings, his precise rhyming schemes, should make him a major force in pop music. ""Limited Time"" is a plaintive cry that should resonate with anyone who ever wanted one more kiss. ""That Car"" is so much fun. And ""We Still Have Christmas"" should be a holiday classic. Brian Gari should be considered among today's top popular composers."
5,THE SONGS CONTINUE TO BE GREAT!,"I've been listening to Brian Gari's music for sometime. He is one of my all time favorite songwriters. He's in my own songwriter Hall of Fame that includes Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Jimmy Webb, Stevie Wonder, and Sting. His latest effort, I CAN'T MAKE YOU FREE, once again proves how Brian continues to write great pop songs. My favorite songs on this current album include THAT CAR which reminded me of the great Beach Boys songs; LIMITED TIME is a wonderful lyric with a beautiful, touching melody; I love the guitar playing on TARA YOU'RE ME; STILL HAVE CHRISTMAS could become a christmas standard along with THE CHRISTMAS SONG. Bravo!"
5,This one is the definition of the Tribal House genre,"An old compilation, with excellent track selection in a very interesting and enjoyable mix. Still sound fresh and energetic, like a live party. 4 times Danny yells into the mike ""so get up!"".Probably the best House compilation disc I own, out of about a hundered. Go see Tenaglia live in Arc - New York.Tribal America - what a legendary label."
5,Highly recommended!,"As usual, Margaret Evans Porter delivers ... this time, a heartwarming love story about a handsome rake and the Manxwoman who loves him. Ellin is one of the warmest, most sympathetic heroines I've met in a long time, and Kerron is just magnificent! If you love original settings, lovable characters, and intelligent writing, THE SEDUCER won't disappoint -- I think it's Margaret Evans Porter's best yet!"
2,Isn't it amazing?,"All the other reviewers loved this book. I hated it. I've very much enjoyed other books by this author, but this offering leaves me cold.The interesting setting held my attention for awhile, but then it faded away. The main characters are thoroughly mismatched. The hero's sudden decision to marry the heroine is completely unmotivated, unexpected and unbelievable.The minor characters were far more interesting and believable than the hero and the heroine, but they were off-stage so much, it didn't matter.If you liked Margaret Porter Evans' other books, you might want to take a look at this one. Other people obviously liked it a lot, but I did not. Isn't it amazing how tastes differ?"
1,"Very, Very Bad","Even sick, stuck in bed I could stopped watching after ten minutes. Bad acting, bad writing, cheesy is being kind. If you wanted to have a ""let's watch a movie to laugh at"" party, this would be at the top of my list."
1,wow. - Zero Stars,i lost all respect for Romeros after this movie. he was good in the past but i guesshis age is catching up to him. he has been on a downhill spiral since land of the dead but thiss one he hit rock bottom. these would be cheesy for even tales from the crypy. please dont make a vol. 2
4,Special FX were Awesome!,Ok so the acting in these shorts were cheesy....but the special FX especially in the film WET were phenomenal!!! If your into special fx and appreciate gory stuff youd enjoy WET!
2,This movie was horrible for Romero to be involved in,I didnt think this film would be so terrible considering Romero was involved in it. I f he would have directed it I know it would have been in the tradition of Creepshow and been decent.
3,The Bungals,"Well, for a video ""highlighting"" the Bungals, it's as good as could be expected. Nothing earth-shattering, and certainly not an essential watch for anyone. But, if you're a true die-hard, and continue the shouts of ""Who-Dey"" despite neverending 3-13 seasons and the worst NFL record of the 1990s, then I suppose you'd be interested in this."
2,Great Songs. Worst. Audio. Quality. Ever.,"This release was not approved by the band -- and it shows. The audio quality is absolutely mind-numbingly awful. ""Dearg Doom,"" for example, sounds like the audio tape used had been buried in peat for 10 years before they brought it to a studio to ""remaster.""Stick to the remastered albums that have come out since 2000. Avoid this at all costs -- unless you are buying it as a collector's item or a coaster for your drinks!"
1,Imation 1946 USB Floppy Drive Outdated,"Product advertised as new. Was NOT new: Pkg had missing flap. Envelope with Software Disk had been opened because Scotch tape no longer sealed the envelope. Floppy Drive Memory/Software is No Longer supported on a MacBook. So basically, this Floppy Drive is only compatible on Older computers.Product purchased on Amazon."
4,Floppy Drive,The floppy drive works great on my desktop and laptop. It arrived promptly and was easy to install.
4,"A good secondary scanner for quick form, bill and letter copies.","I had a heck of a time trying to get this running. The short story is go to the Visioneer web site to download the latest tools and utilities. I have it running fine on a Windows 7 notebook.I have a standard flatbed scanner for photos that is my primary use, but for quick scans of bills, receipts etc., it's a great addition. I save everything to PDF and can shred most paper keeping the documents as files backed up on disc. For tax purposes, it's ideal. You have everything searchable and no digging through papers and file drawers. I am not almost completely paperless and this is the way to go.The quality is pretty good, and everything textual is crisp and printable. Obviously not intended for photos or artistic use, even though it is a color scanner. I prefer my standard flatbed. This is merely a companion to my paper shredder.The current (MSRP) list price is too high, but the sale price is currently 64% off. That's about right."
2,Visioneer Strobe XP 220,"This scanner didn't do half of what the ad said it would do. I bought it to scan color photos, (Which it failed to do). It dumps a lot of software onto your hard drive and it does not uninstall in a clean fashion. You have to hunt down all the crap it stored and ""Force Remove"" the garbage out of your system.It scanned Black and White materials perfectly, but no color."
3,Poor support,"I liked the product but dispite doing all the suggestions and attempting to reach tech support it continued to have a black stripe down center, so had to return it. Needs better support."
1,horrible,"The installation is so difficult and requires more time than I am willing to spend on a scanner that is supposed to be plug and play more like plug and throw away. Get something else that is easier to install. The website has very little in documentation for such a well documented problem, you would think this company would look at the Amazon site that reviews its products and resolve the installation problem. Looks like they are more willing to lose business than fix a problem."
1,No solid information,This was a waste of time for me. Very few facts about the real Robin Hood. Too much repeated material. I felt the sales material was misleading. I am not glad that I purchased it other than to check it out.
1,not a happy little baby,I bought this bouncer for my granddaughter before she was born. She was little (5lbs. 12 ozs.) at birth and this seat was not contoured for her size...something that was not made clear in the box info. But as she has grown and now six weeks later and weighing almost 8 lbs. it still is not comfortable. It has a very deep center and she sinks in and cannot stretch her legs or her body. I think it may be more appropriate for a bigger baby and hopefully she will be more comfortable in it in the future. But I was really disappointed at the quality and technology of this product.
1,Returned this product TWICE,"Very cute bouncer, but my husband and I had to return this product back to the store twice . . . and our baby isn't even born yet. The first time, the product was missing one of the metal assembly clamps. The second time, the fabric seam literally tore apart DURING assembly. Needless to say, we're going with a different bouncer."
2,so cute so useless,"I purchased this unit because my daughter was small and I thought it would cradle her. The pillow made her head touch her chin, so I had to turn it upside down. The vibration feature did not work from the minute I brought it home. The sound features worked for about a week. The 2 stars are for the looks but overall not a good purchase."
4,Great baby bouncer!,I just received the bouncer today. I am so happy it comes in pink too!! Everything works great on it and it is so very soft. I gave it 4 stars for two reasons... 1. The headrest does not attach to the bouncer in anyway. It just rests on the bouncer. 2. I agree with the other reviews about the play bar. It is a little flimsy and the way it attaches could be better. Other than that it is a great bouncer. Very roomy and pretty at the same time. I love it :)
1,No Response and Not Happy,"I was so excited to receive this bouncy seat for my shower as it is adorable and so pink. However, I too, like another reviewer had the toy bar piece snap off just by attaching it with normal pressure creating a choking hazard as well as an eyesore everytime I want to use it. I wrote to the company and called several times and they have not responded! To make matters worse my seat ripped the first time I washed it on GENTLE CYCLE in cold water. This seat is a disgrace and Carters should be ashamed for putting their name on it! Do not purchase this seat unless you want disappointment!"
5,Love it! It's the best!,"I really, really recommend CARTER'S cradle and soothe bouncer We tried 3 before we tried this one. It cradles them so that they don't fall to one side and it reclines to make a cozy cradle for sleeping. Everything works great. It makes soothing sounds and vibrations and it has a removable activity bar. Another thing that makes this one the best (in my opinion), is that the frame bounces so easily with just a gentle nudge of the fingers. It was like it had a gentle spring and it was soooo smooth. MOST do not bounce that smoothly. My wrists and arms were sore from bouncing my baby in the others! (he was collicky, so we bounced a lot) It was mid-range in price, but worth every dang penny!!!!! It's pretty too! We got the blue and green one."
2,Wouldn't recomend it,"My husband actually picked this one out and I thought it was really cute. However, as I've used it I have begun to dislike it. Just like one other mother said, the vibrating thing stopped working even with new batteries and when I look at my daughter in it she looks absolutely uncomfortable. I am affraid of future back problems due to the lack of support for her back when she is in this bouncer. And yes the music is very annoying also..."
5,Its Forbidden !,Black sabbath with tony martin on vocals and it couldn't get any better than this !Why the hate ? Stop living in the past and give it a listen.This album deserves to be re-released.Everytime you shout forbidden makes me wonder what you'll see.
3,"Ok, but could have been better","I love Sabbath and I like Tony Martin. In fact some of my favorire Sabbath cd's feature Tony Martin on Vocals. Headless Cross and Cross Purposes are great cd's. However Forbidden falls short here. Sure it has some pretty good tracks, but most of them just don't stick out. It reminds me a lot of the new Judas Priest cd as in it's very bland sounding. I will say it's better than the latest Priest offering, but that's not saying very much. If you like Sabbath or Tony Martin, it's probably worth adding to your collection. If your just a casual fan, I wouldn't recomend it."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"This is simply the WORST Sabbath album ever. I'm no Tony Martin hater; Cross Purposes is probably my 3rd favorite of all their albums, and frankly the band has never had a bad singer (I even liked Seventh Star and Born Again), but this album is just horrible. There is no energy or chemistry at all on this record. Even Technical Ecstasy had some listenable moments, but after one listen through this abominable album it sat on my shelf untouched for years until I needed some space and sold it back to the music shop for about a buck... yeah, I ripped off the store for a buck, because this album isn't even worth spending a penny on."
1,I Won't Cry For You,"the only song that i still play is I Won't Cry For You , this is why i still have the tape, this is a song that before the mp3 time i had to buy the tape for, Ice-T sukz on this album, he was on top of his game untill the mid 90s, many fans hate this cd just cause its called black sabbath if it was with another name it would had came out and gone without any one knowig of its existence."
1,FORBIDDEN TO LISTEN,"This CD is forbidden to listen, because it is forbidden the sad decline SABBATH went into after the OZzy / Dio days. How Iommi left this happen..?"
1,an embarassment,"How can you call this Black sabbath?! I find everything about this album dissapointing. The only original member left is Tony. There's no Ozzy, no Geezer, and no Bill Ward. As for the actual musical aspect of this garbage, It's worse! How can Iomii let Ernie C from Body count produce? How can he let Ice T rap? if you're gonna do something experimental like that, don't do it on the first track. It kind of ruined the whole album for me. Also, there is no memorable Iomii riffs on here. Plus way too much techno, electronic stuff. And by the way, tony martin has nowhere near the talent of Ozzy. Please, please, please don't let this be the last Sabbath studio album."
1,Awful,This is just awful. I can't believe I spent money on this thing. Tony Iommi should have to send me a check.
2,Black Sabbath - 'Forbidden' (EMI),"When I noticed all the one star and two star reviews this 1995 release had,I thought I should indeed take time to check it out for myself.As it turns out,'Forbidden' isn't that bad of an effort,it just simply isn't very Sabbath-like.It's Black Sabbath in name,ONLY.More or less second rate British metal.One track on here that really irritates the crap out of me is ""Sick And Tired"" where Body Count members Ernie C. and Ice-T share the vocal duties.I mean,come on!Few tunes that I thought were 'okay' include ""Illusion Of Power"",""Rusty Angels"" and the title cut ""Forbidden"".A disc that would likely serve the sole purpose to some to play ONLY if they can't find anything else handy to kill some time with."
5,Awesome Sabbath album!,"This album rocks, Iommi continues to amaze me, Sabbath just keeps getting better. My fav Sabbath is with DIO (the true Sabbath) but this album proves there is no true Sabbath, every singer they get makes them better and better, and makes you realize that even though Ozzy rocks, he ain't Black Sabbath."
2,Just plain terrible minus a couple spots,"I couldn't believe how bad this album was when I first bought it. It has grown on me a little bit, as I grew to really like the last two songs, but nearly everything before it is terrible. Tony Martin's vox are atrocious on this release. However, I heard that the management told him to sing this way to sound more ""grunge."" If you are a die hard fan, buy it for the last two songs. The final track has a tinge of TYR in the change, but just for a second. Sabbath said that this was an album that was written and recorded to get out of a contract obligation, and it sounds it."
4,sabbath fans only,iommi is trying to keep the band alive and is doing pretty good. The cd is not bad except for a couple tracks. For the most part I was impressed by iommi's new guitar work. Its cheap so go get it.
2,silly cover!,"i bought this album brand new for only 7 or 8 bucks and i liketo think i got my moneys worth! i really have no use for barelyany SABBATH album after BORN AGAIN, with the possible exceptionof THE ETERNAL IDOL, which definitely has some good songs on it!FORBIDDEN has two very good things going for it; the cover isprobably their funniest ever, right next to SABOTAGE! I like thedrawing on it and how silly the band members look! I also quitelike the opening track on it, ILLUSION OF POWER. Featuring aguest appearance by ICE T, this song has more character and per-sonality than any song they'd done in a while. It also has TONYMARTIN'S best vocal on it, along with another very powerfulguitar riff from IOMMI. The rest of this I could really do with-out; it's not that it's really that bad, it's just not that in-teresting, even tho' the production is very good and loud. Mostof this is just standard TONY IOMMI heavy metal. nothing specialat all, tho' the first track is great!"
1,Forbidden Means Literal!,"I bought this one when it first came out, but, man, this is horrible! The only songs even able to measure up are ""Illusion of Power"" and ""Won't Cry for You"", and even they aren't the best. The others range from borderline mediocre to Three-Stooges-on-crack quality. ""Can't get close enough to you 'cause you're just too far away?"" DUH! (bang your head against the table... bang your head against the table... bang your head against the table...) Tony Martin sounds like he has strep throat, Tony Iommi's guitar sounds uncharacteristically palsied, and Neil Murray's bass was better when he played with Whitesnake. The only bright spot to this album is Cozy Powell's drums, which keep up a relentless assault on your eardrums until they bleed. Now, I must ask the question ""What were they thinking?"" Better yet ""What weren't they thinking?"" It makes for a shorter list."
2,"""Okay""...but nowhere near Cross Purposes or Headless Cross..","Forbidden in my opinion just wasn't all that great, and even a majority of the die-hard Tony Martin-Sabbath fans skip over this one or just burn the one of two good tracks from the cd onto cassette or cdrs. First off, the production was horrible. The production alone kills off whatever power we might have heard coming out of Cozy Powell's drum unit, who many say was Sabbath's most talented skinsman. There ARE a few standout tracks like Rusty Angels, I Would Die For You, Kiss Of Death and Loser Gets It All. Other than that, moreso than not this is worth skipping over. Tony Martin has had far better vocal days as in the previous albums."
2,sad really,"thoughts on listening to _Forbidden_:great riff...pity about the singer...is that a drum machine?...is there any bass on this record at all?....Ice-T even sounds weak here.i never bothered w/ post-_Born Again_ Sabbath, until a morbid curiousity drove me to purchase this one.Black Sabbath is God.this isn't Black Sabbath.1 star for some riffs that deserved better. 1 star out of pity for the fallen god."
4,it's pretty good,"i have to say that this cd is actually pretty good out of all the songs i think that ""rusty angels"" is the best song but the worst is ""sick and tired"""
2,"Bad, but not Terrible!!","This is one of the weaker entries for Sab, but certainly not the worst i.e. Born Again being the worst. This album has some redeeming qualities, but not many Illison of Power was a decent track feat. Ice-T. That track had somewhat of a throwback to earilier Sabbath, being that it was dark and gloomy sounding. Kiss of Death was a pretty good track featuring some hard driving guitar by Iommi. Guilty as Hell as was another track I liked off the album. All in all this album suffers from bad production sound and poor writting in most of the tracks, but still much better than some of the music out there today. Recommended only for true Black Sabbath fans."
3,Sabbath's last offering,"This was Sabbath's last studio offering(at least I'm pretty sure). It does contain some good points, but overall it does sound a bit uninspired. Let me just say that ""Illusion of Power"" is one of the worst Sabbath songs ever, extremely slow and worst of all it has rap! The second half of the album was indeed better. ""Guilty as Hell"" has some strong lyrics, while ""Rusty Angels"" has sparks of heavy and melodicness. ""Forbidden"" could have been a better title track, but it does start out with some great pounding guitar and drums! ""Kiss of Death"" is a very long and depressing song, but a high point to this dull album. Kind of a sad to know this is the last offering."
2,Very Disappointing,"As a long time fan of the band I was very disappointed in this album, as I have always loved Sabbath material with Tony Martin. Cross Purposes was a good album but the follow up here is not even close. The loss of Geezer and the addition of Dave Murray and even Cozy Powell doesn't help. Aside from the tracks ""Rusty Angels"" and ""Forbidden"" I find that this album has less to offer than previous Sabbath lp's. For the most part the muscianship is good and Tony's solo's are decent but most of the music sounds tired and thrown together. There doesn't appear to be the chemistry in the songwriting that was present in this previous incarnation of the band (HC/Tyr era). It is a decent rock record but definately the worst that Sabbath has to offer."
4,much better than expected,"After reading the reviews of 13 year old boys who think Sabbath was Iron Man, War Pigs, N.I.B & Paranoid I thought this album was going to suck big-time. However, after skipping the first 2 songs this CD has now become my favourite Tony Martin/Sabbath C.D. Do yourselves a favour and listen to this with an open mind and enjoy. You wont regret it."
3,Cozy Powell's and Sabbath's last studio album.,"Forbidden reunites the Iommi-Martin-Powell-Murray and Nicholls line-up.They originally did the Headless Cross tour(Laurence Cottle-check that spelling-played bass on the album), and the TYR album and tour. This is a very good endeavor for 1995. I saw the tour at the Ventura Theatre. Just one year before Geezer Butler and Bobby Rondinelli comprised the band for Cross Purposes. Talk about Iommi having a Never Say Die attitude. The best song on Forbidden is Kiss of Death. Really darn good.Won't Cry for You and Guilty as Hell stand up well. I would give the previous album a slight edge. Forbidden rounds off at about 3.5 . END"
1,tai chi fan,"I bought this product because it had good ratings,HOWEVER, it was awful. The video, i know would be used, came not fully wound. The pictures were blurry. I COULD NOT rewind it( had sooo much fuzzy lines ) or even pause/still it."
5,An intoxicating mix of music and beauty!,"I have listened to this album at least 100 times in three months. It exhibits many qualities in musical tastefulness. The chord changes are unique. The lyrics and the insrumentation is NOT the same ol' same ol' typical stuff coming out today. The message is positive. Overall, the sound is fresh and new. It should be mainstream. I will see what I can do about that, if Anna Kim will allow me to try. I am a fan of her music, and I wish her well in all that she does. Sincerely, Mark Scardello 10/4/00"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this waiter's corkscrew hoping it would be easier to use than the cheap one I bought during my last visit to a winery.Unfortunately, this corkscrew fails in every way. It is heavy, heavy enough to be unpleasant in the hand. The knife cuts poorly. The corkscrew awkwardly bumps against the knife when you fold it back in. And all the pieces are stiff and hard to pull out.I thought I could save the situation by at least fixing stiffness by oiling the corkscrew, but that failed to produce much of an improvement. In the end, I just threw it out.Disappointing."
4,Margaret and God,"This book was very good. I would recommend this book, because it was interesting. It was interesting because it taught me a lot about what I will go through. I think my little cousin, that is nine, would enjoy reading this book. She is a girly girl and would enjoy this book and do what they do. Her name is Jennifer. I would like to read another book by Judy Blume. I think I would read the Ramona books. I would read them because; they show what to do and not to do in life. Her writing style is very good. I understand what she is saying. I like how Judy Blume writes from the main characters point of view."
2,Are You There God It's Me Margret,"Summary: A girl named Margret moved to New Jersey and she got a new school. She made some new friends and joined one of her friends club. She was praying to be with her friends in the classes. She really likes her teacher. She is no religion because her Mom is Christian and her Dad is Jewish.What I liked about the book: I liked that it was about girls.What I didn't like about the book: I did not like it because it was for older girls.Sydney,age 8,Buffalo NY"
5,i absoulutly loved the book!,"I really enjoyed this book because it taught a lot of lifes' lessons. Mararet is a fantastic young woman who in the book shares her intermost deepest secrets about boys, her religion, and becoming a woman. she doesn't know which religion is the right one for her, when her parents give her the desision of choosing her own. Her expeirementing with trying out some of them doesn't really help her make a desision. she goes through tough times but always looks at the bright side of things and that's what really got me to believe that margaret was becoming one of my friends. as I read the book she felt closer to me. to bad she's not a real person! I would definently recommend this book, but probably only to a female, mostly because it has woman related material. when I am asked to list my favorite books, I will not hessitate to say ""Are You There God, It's Me Margaret""."
3,Wasn't that good,"I read this book when I was 11 and because nothing in it applied to me, I wondered if maybe there was something wrong with me (I'd already been wearing a bra for a year and the other kids in my class made fun of me, I didn't care about starting my period, I didn't have friends at school). It was an O.K. story but I don't think it was realistic."
1,Stupid,"I am just a little older than Margaret, and when I was that age and even now no one even talked about that. It's embarassing to get your period. Having breasts makes a (normal) girl self concious. I have never talked to my friends about puberty. It's bad enough discussing it in Health class.Besides, who wants to grow up that fast? I am 12 and probably wil never want to be grown up, and when I am an adult, I'll probably act like a kid. I mean, woulddn't you rather play some sports or go to the movies with your friends, or play outside or with toys than dream about sex with 11 year old boys? I have a feeling that if there was a sequel with Margaret at 16, she would be pregnant.I love Judy Blume, don't get me wrong. Especially the Fudge books, those are great. But please, don't read this book."
3,"Are you there God? It's Me, Margaret","Enjoyed the book - but a younger reader would relate to it more - kids do go thru these crises, and it was well written."
4,Are you there God? Its me Margaret.,This book was a good bookits was about growing up. Margaret has moved to a town and meeting new people at the same time she goign though alot of changes with her life and her body. I would recamind this book to any girl because they probibly experiance changes with them selfs and beacuase it is alwso a funny book.
5,Inspiring Book for Young Readers,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret is the best book I've ever read. To me the book was a guide through the rough years of my life. The book was full of raw emotion and drama. The book was about an 11 going on 12 year old girl trying to cope with moving to a strange new town and normal pre-teen things. Overall I'd say this was a very well written book."
5,book of girls,This book is a book girls my age 11 can relate to Maragret goes through the same things as we do this book helped me along in understanding who i am. I think this book was outstanding!!!!!!!!
3,it could have been better,this book was ok yes it was about this girl deciding religion but it kinda side tracked on other things like starting her period! Thats what could have been left out and i think the book could have been better but it didnt make me fall asleep and it was short enough to be sorda good
2,Unrealistic View of a Sixth Grader. Judy bombed this time!!,"I got this book because it seemed fairly intresting and looked like a good read, and I loved Blubber and It's Not the End of the World. Boy was I disappointed. This book was totally unrealistic. It was supposed to be a realistic view of a sixth grader. WRONG!!! I don't know any girl my age who would make such a big deal over getting a stupid bra. I did, however, like the parts about the boys and Margaret struggling with religion. If Judy Blume were to write a book strictly about this, I'd be first in line to buy it!!! Too bad it was ruined by everything else. Also, at my school, a period is just something you get and life moves on.Please, if you want a realistic view of a sixth grader, read something like It's Not the End of the World, or Blubber. This may or may not be in sixth grade, but they are much better. Judy Blume has bombed with Are You there God?!"
4,Needs an update to be Relevant in 2010,I remember reading this when I was a young girl. It was out of date at the time. I didn't know what a sanitary napkin belt was. I was disappointed when I read it that it had not been updated. It spoke about albums and sanitary napkin belts.It could easily be updated to be relevant today.The characters are richly portrayed. It took me back to that time when my body underwent those confusing changes.
2,book review,This is a mass produced copy of a great book. The content is terrific. The quality and print of this copy is terrible. It bothers my daughter's eyes to read it. I would return it if it wouldn't cost me half the price of the book to do so between packaging and shipping. I will most likely donate this book to her school. I have seen much nicer copies of this book at my local Barnes & Noble. That is where I will go to purchase it for my daughter again.
1,A very fictional book,"First of all, this book is quite unrealistic. I remember when I had my first period. I did not freak out like the girl in this book. It scares some children who read it to think that it will actually be like that. Alsoher friends were very inapropriate. Most normal sixth graders, even now, do not talk about the sort of things of which the group of girls in the story did. I do not recommend this book for anyone to read. It will scare younger girls out of their minds about what their adolescence will be like."
1,"This is a good book to have your young daughter read, IF...","This is a good book to have your young daughter read, IF you don't think kids already grow up too fast, or IF you don't think they are already exposed to enough sexuality from the culture, or IF you want her to be thinking about having sex before she is even in her teens, let alone married, or IF you haven't had a serious talk with her about the issues covered in this book, which, by the way, should come from the parent, not from an explicit book that treats these important topics in a flippant manner.I'm not sure which is a sadder commentary--the book itself, or the fact that it received so many positive reviews."
3,Not good for kids under 8 or 9 years old,"I bought this for my six year old and want to hide it until she gets a bit older. The characters talk about wearing bras and making out behind the A&P, etc... not appropriate for younger readers. My six year old can read it - I just don't want her to."
1,A junky book with too much private sayings.,This book tells too much about a girl teenagers body when they're growing up.Disgusting and unappropriate.Tells too much about developing.You can miss this one if you'd like.
5,A frank look at growing up...not at all obscene.,"I read this book as a twelve year old in the 80's, and it made me feel more comfortable with adolescence, to see that I was not the only one with the same questions I had. It is an eye-popping book, even with today's standards, and yes, I would buy a copy for my daughter. If you wish to keep your daughter in the dark about changes her mind and body are going through, don't buy this book."
5,A MUST FOR EVERY PRE-TEEN GIRL,"I recall this book when I was young and it's as good then as it is now. Judy Blume speaks in terms that are easy to relate to and she just has a way of making sure you don't put the book down for a moment unless you want to miss the next scene. It's a sure win with any young girl and a nice start off to pre-teenhood. She communicates with God the entire time and she lets him know what's new and what's happening so she's not alone. So many people can relate to this book on so many levels. Even as adults I'd suggest if you haven't read it, read it first then pass it to your pre-teen or teen - you won't regret it. It's sure to be chatted about after you've both shared the book togther."
5,A really good book.Read it!,"Are You There God? It's Me,Margaret is a really good book I think.Good for ages 10-13.It is a belivable story about a girl named Margaret and she just moves to a new town.And her father is Jewish and her mother is Christian and Margaret does'nt know what she is.It's about Margaret Growing up.Michelle 10"
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!!!","Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret is honestly one of the worst books that I have ever read. This book tries to teach young adolescents about growing up...Helpful, right? Wrong!!! The characters displayed in the story that young girls are supposed to relate to are mean, stupid people who all want to be exactly like everyobody else. Is this how you want your child to act? My advise is to give the book to her to read if you must, but to tell her ""it's okay...I don't think you're as dumb as these people"". I read the book as a twelve-year-old because my doctor recommended it to me, and my first thought was that I hoped she didn't think I was like the girls in the story. Adolescents need to know that there is more to life than whether or not you have a bra; this book teaches just the opposite."
1,Why in the world does she presume that girls are like this?,I think that this book is neither believable or touching. The problems which margaret overcomes and the life she leads is idillac and fake. The realism judy blume seems to have with this novel is zero. teenagers do not behave like that..
1,Immature & annoying,"This book is one of the corniest books I've ever read. Margaret is a stupid ignorant girl who is way too excited about being sick every month. (a.k.a., getting her period.) You would think she would dread this moment, but she's so eager to ""grow up"", and she and her stupid friends form a club just for talking about puberty and crushes. What kind of club only lets you in if you have a bra? (Margaret doesn't need one!) So don't read this immature book (unless you want to make fun of it.)"
2,Precocious and a little too cute...,"There are so many wonderful books out there for girls of this age, ""Are you there, God?"" should be at the bottom of your To Buy List."
1,Nothing for me in this book.,"As a 34 year old man, I found this book to be a bit dissapointing. It was full of silly, schoolgirlish scenarios and immature views that I just could not get my head around. When I asked my 13 year old daugther to explain excerpts to me, she just rolled her eyes and told me how much she hated me. I will not read any more books by Judy Bloom. From now on, I will stick to the Hardy Boys. They never dissapoint me."
4,I really enjoyed it.,I really enjoyed this book it was full of nice things. It makes you wonder if there is a God and where it is. Can you talk to her really? and are all Americans like Margret.The story-line is a bit weak but on the whole it was a great book. The only thing I didn't like about this book is Margret is a bit immature for a 12 year old although some girls are like this in England we arn't. By the time most British girls are 12 they have been wearing bra's for 2or 3 years and are quite experienced with boys.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book. I could really relate to some of the problems that Margaret had. Margaret's parents did not believe in religion, but Margaret was really envious of her friends who belonged to a Y or a jewish community center. Margaret was trying to decide which religion she should be. In this book margaret finds out that she IS close to god, and god is not only in a religion but god is in you. Margaret talks to god about normal pre-teen problems, liked periods, bras and boys. This book is really helpful to pre-teen girls. I really reccomend it."
5,This is the best book!,"This is the best book I've ever read. I think Judy Blume did an EXCELLENT job! It's interesting because where Margaret use to live in New York they were all normal but when she moved to New Jersey they weren't normal at all. Margaret got asked by one of her next door neighbors, Nancy (Who's in her class) if she would like to be in a secret club with some of her friends. But now Margaret has to watch out because these kids ain't normal at all!"
4,Heart-Warming Delight,"I recommend this book to any girl. This book is good for the female sex because it's about the changes girls go through. This book was a touching and heart-warming delight. This book could help a lot of girls because it could help with problems that girls have. Margaret tells God that she wants a bra and tells him about how the girls are getting bras for the club. ""I told my mom I want a bra."" Most girls go through the same changes and they don't know it. They think that they are the only ones going through the change. Like Margaret she thinks she's not normal and she wants to be like everyone else, but really she is she's just going through her changes. ""I want to be like everyone else."" In conclusion if you are a young girl going though the changes of life then you would enjoy this book."
4,LSMS,I think this was a good book but not for younger kids. This book the whole time tells about a girl that is going through puberty. Some parents might not think it is appropriate for their kids but I think if they are at least in 5th grade and they are a girl than this book can be enjoyable because it is kind of funny and they can relate to the girl in the story. I enjoyed it.
4,Dear God,"...I read Dear God by Judy Blume. This book was about the pain of Marguret is waiting for her ""woman hood"" to come. She has a list of problems. She moves from California to a small town. She learns about growing up and trying to find her religious path. This book gets 4 thumbs up. It shows realistic things that kids every where still does. I reconmend this bookfor ages 9-13."
5,Trials and Tribulations of Female Puberty,"I read the book before I gave it to my turning-13-year-old granddaughter, who hasn't had her first period yet. Basied on her developing figure, and her mood changes, this event will happen within the year. I loved the book. I hope she likes it."
5,Going to give to my granddaughter for christmas,Good Book nice book for young girls to read.She liker the Judy Blume booksShe has most of her books
5,One of my favorite books from my pre-teen years!!,"I was reading back in one of my old diaries today--and i came across a sentence that read: you are most like the character--and there was a blank. I had written Margaret. I knew exactly where it came from. I think I read it in 4th or 5th grade and I just remember it made me feel like the author understood what we were going through--and how could she have remembered all that? i swallowed up the details and I laughed and felt bad for the character. I thought it was funny about what a big deal the periods for the girls were---and how she was struggling with religion and what she should believe. I have recommended this to some parents for their daughters but I worry that the ""religion choosing"" thing might bother them. I loved this book and i think every young girl should read this book. It was written 20 or 30 years ago and she still understood what i was going through!!"
2,Am I the only one in the world who hated this book?,"Really, I don't get why people think this book is so realistic. Matagret is a sixth grade girl who is flat, and is wrorried she'll never grow. This is sixth grade! And it's not like all her friends are bra-wears; they have the same ""problems"". Her ""crush"" is the cutest and meanest boy in class: she doesn't want to like the nice guy who has a crush on her because her friends hate him. She and her mom are best friends, and the most un-realustic deal: she's imature, flat, never kissed, and doesn't have her period at the beging of the book, and by the end all has passed. Please. Also, it seems as though Judy Blume has tried to cram every single thing that happens in puberty in this book and it drags. Don't read this book if you're looking for real life."
2,"Started getting good towards the end, BUT, then ...","On page 138 ...""we went into the drugstore to look around. Mostly we liked to inspect the sanitary napkin display.""OMG!I had just finished eating a coconut butter sandwich when I read this.YUCK!What's this obsession with periods?Ugh!I was not like this @ age 12!The Jewish/Christian dilemma is understandable.But the ""mens-stroo-ation""?Gimme a break.Judy Blume is an excellent writer, but this story is kind of shallow.JMHO."
5,A very well-written book!!!,"I think that Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret is one of my favorite books. It talks about puberty and the stress these girls are handling while growing up. They form a club, and that is about all I can tell you. but really do read this book, it is my favorite and I have read it fourteen times!"
5,I can't put it down,Whene I got the book I thought oh great a book about puberty but when I started reading itI loved It soo much. It is the funiest and best book I have ever read. You have to check this one out or youre missing alot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Discuss with your child,"This book is best used if parent and child read and discuss it.This book also deals with masturbation, so be forewarned."
3,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret",This book is the best book ive ever read.IF you read this book you will lolve it.It talks about a girl and her problems she belives she talks to god but she dosent. Her parents try to convence her that she dose not talk to god. Her and her friends love talking one and other. They are bearly growing and they cant wait to be grown ups. YOu should read this book you will love it.. Well got to go. :)
3,"Funny, yet imformitive","Im the type of person who likes a good book with an interesting plot. However, I also enjoy books I can laugh at and identify with along the way. This book helped me understand the facts and struggles that lay before me. I enjoyed every page of this book and I recomened it to women and girls of all ages."
4,One good book,"This book is an excellent book about a girl named Margaret who moves to a new, small little town. There, she makes friends, almost-enemies, crushes, and a decision to do a year-long project on religion. Her parents each come from different religions, and Margaret has to deal with her grandmother pressuring her to become Jewish, as well as seeing her other grandparents for the first time and having them pressure her, too. As well as the religious stuff, Margaret deals with her friends, her first supper party, her first dance, and girl's body issues, to name a few. All through these things, Margaret has her own private conversations with God. She's atheist, but she still talks to God.The only thing I couldn't stand was what happened in the end. The message it sends across there was very corny and made me angry, as I am an atheist. But aside from the end, this was a fun, enjoyable, identifiable read that you would like."
4,"Fun, but not what I was expecting","So I love Judy Blume mainly because the first book I ever read of hers was ""Forever"", which tells the story of a young girl's first time having sex and all the complications that come with it. So when I got this book on my kindle I thought it would be just as gritty. Of course this book is about an even younger girl who is waiting to get her period and struggles with her Faith. It does tell a very lovely story and is quite sweet so I would definitely read it again. I just wish there had been more."
4,This book is great for girls who are growing up!,This book is a great book for girls from the age of about 10-13. It really tells what it is like to start growing up. You really feel what the characters are feeling. It talks about how much the characters care about what people think about them and how they deal with it. It is a great book!
2,Okay,"This book was okay, and it was easy to keep reading. I think it was really unrealistic, becuase I have never heard of a 6th grader who was that obsessed with her outer appearance. When I was in 6th grade, I wasn't worrying about what I looked like, as long as I was presentable and cute. I didn't care what guys thought of me in the ""love"" sense, just who was best at kickball. If you're looking for a little un-reality, read the book, but if you are looking for a real life situation, pass it by. I'm in 8th grade now, and wish that I hadn't read the book. It gave me so many false ideas about what life was going to be like. I still haven't experienced much of the book because I'm a 5'4 92 lb stick......oh well, my time will come."
5,"Are You there God,It's Me Margaret","I was 11 (I am now 32) when I read this marvelous book and I can remember having such a sigh of relief after finishing it. Judy Blume hi the nail on the head with this one and anything short of a five star rating is unfathomable. Taking changing times and slang into account, this book still touches the core questions of any preteen girl. It's a treasure!"
4,It had real-life issues with which girls can relate to.,"Teaching preteen girls about themselves and their personal growth can be hard. Judy Blume does an excellent job of looking throught the eyes of a young girl and writing a story about it. Girls of this age can sometimes feel young and unimportant, like they are not 'right'. Perhaps if a girl who is having some personal problems needs something to let her know she is not alone, then this book is a good way to tell her. I believe that preteen girls would be able to relate to some of the fellings Margaret is going through, and that this book would definately be appropiate for those girls to read."
4,"A wonderful, realistic view of a teenagers thoughts.","I thought this was a novel that new exactly what I was thinking. It dealt with sort of the same problems at my school even if there in a slight century difference. Even if you know all about that kind of stuff, it is good to know the same point of view."
2,Ok,"I read this book because a friend reccommended it. It's ok, but Margaret is so eager to grow up. Personally, most girls I know want to be kids forever. They'd rather read, play sports, and go outside than tink about stupid things like the girls in here do.i found that Nancy was bossy and disgusting. I think that you would be better off reading the Fudge books by Judy Blume."
2,Disgusting.,"This book was very interesting, and Judy Blume is an excellent author. However, I don't think the book is really appropriate for pre-teenage children. As a matter of fact, it especially is not appropriate for adults...The realism is lost, in all honesty, when all the girls are going crazy about starting puberty. Nobody is that excited about their period or bras. I think there are plenty of other books for children to read about puberty that are more informative and less in the realm of cheesy romance novels."
2,Pure torture,"I first read this book when I was 11 and I didn't like it at all. Margaret is such a jerk for picking the handsome boy over the nice boy and for being mean to another girl just because her breasts are big. Also, who in her right mind would *want* big breasts when girls who have them get called sluts just because they wear a bra? And who in her right mind would *want* to get her period when all it means is a lot of mess and fuss? The only thing I like about this book is the insight into different religions, which is vaguely interesting. (...)it makes girls who are ""different"" feel like they are bad people."
5,judy bloom is good,Are you there God It's Me Margaret is the best book I red this year. I know that I am a girl like Margaret and she is a girl like me! I know that God is good and that Margaret gets to make God her best friend and how she is growing up and moving away and making new friends because it is what life is about.My aunt's name is Margaret too and she talks to god that is why I choose the book! And now somtimes I talk to God and ask are you there God it's me Jenny. And sometimes I pretend he answers.This book was good and Judy Bloom helps people to be ok.My brother tried to red Are you there God its me Margaret too but he said that it was a girls book. I just want to say that boys can read it too.
4,Excellent reading material for the adolescents...,"I found this book was hard to put down, yet I find this true with all of Judy Blume's books. Judy Blume creates these phenomenal characters that allow the reader to be soaked up within the material. I found myself relating to Margaret and her everyday issues in many ways as I was a young teen entering the risky world of ""woman hood"". The pressures of school, boys, friends, and having to choose a religion allows young readers to see that they're not alone. I will definitely recommend this book to my students!"
5,Obsoletes Rock,"This is one of the best albums that I have ever bought. Two of the band's members are from the old pop-punk band Yesterday's Kids (they have great CD's as well you should pick them up as well). But anyway, I've listen to this CD over and over and I can't find one bad song on it. I would recomend this to anybody thats into indie music with a counrty twang."
1,NO!,"While the term DVD usually refers to a movie that was produced after DVD's were invented, this one takes the cake from all the other exceptions. Obviously this video is a compilation of several VHS tapes of educational shows produced in the 1970's. Very few facts included, and your kids probably won't stop making fun of the graphics long enough to hear them anyway. Buyer Beware!"
5,A Great Oven for the Price,"I recently purchased this microwave after my old one bit the dust. I'm really happy with it. It's large enough to hold just about anything, and the high wattage makes cooking and re-heating quick and easy. My favorite feature is the invertor defrost....no more frozen in the middle/cooked on the edges defrosted meat. I also like the fact that the ""beep"" on this oven is not too loud or obnoxious. This oven is very large, if this is your first larger microwave purchase and you don't have alot of counter space you will need a microwave cart or somewhere else to put this."
3,Great movie for the price.,"I didnt expect much but was happy with the results. This is a low budget movie filmed in New Zealand. Good story, decent acting and good special effects. If you can get it for under 7 bucks there are worse things you could spend your money on."
4,The New Zealand Version of Shaun of the Dead,"I bought the Last of the Living along with three other zombie flicks for only five dollars at Walmart. I wasn't expecting much from a low-budget movie, but Last of the Living is actually funny despite some terrible zombie makeup.The plot involves three slackers, Morgan, Johnny, and Ash, as they spend their days playing video games and watching movies in mansions. They accidentally run into a female scientist, Stef, who claims to have a cure, but she needs help getting a vile of blood to an island, where the military are suppose to be located.The characters are silly, but likeable. Considering I had never heard of the movie before I wasn't planning on liking it this much."
3,"Good zombie movie, better than some others...","I wasn't expecting much of this movie. I was happily surprised. The plot is fairly simple, but enough to motivate the characters. The FX are surprisingly good in a few places. The actors are like-able and play their parts well. There were some standard horror / zombie scare moments -- but that's the fun part of zombie movies. The movie veered into ""fart joke"" territory about 2/3 of the way through -- enough to be noticeable. I've spent more on other movies and been much more disappointed... it's worth the buy."
4,Further proof that women ruin everything.,"This is a pretty good ""shaun of the Dead"" style zombie flick.Three friends move from mansion to mansion, go on zombie bashing supply runs, and sit around drinking and playing video games all day. Basically, THE LIFE. But a chick comes along and talks them into helping her find a cure. Everything goes down hill from there.The characters are goofy and funny, the plot was good and the gore was gorey."
4,Movie,"I was looking for this to be a ""fun"" zombie movie. It was actually. You had your laughs, your scares and your gore. So, to sum it up I am glad I bought it. The ending wasn't as good as it had potential to be, but that's a minor point. I would recommend just because the actors were fun and light. There is plenty of action and gore, so it balanced well enough. Better than expected."
1,a BIG miss in zomedy..,"anyone hoping that this could stand up to ""Shaun of the dead"" should be warned. the zombie gore and comedy is missing on every asspect of the movie. the plot is almost there but they fail in bringing an enjoyable zombie movie."
2,Okay,"Unlike the high budget Zombie flicks, this movie was okay, the best thing I liked about it and that kept my intrest was the fact that the group of Characters felt very real, related to normal every day people and how they would really react to such a situation. Where as the high budget films have everyone shooting Zombies left and right and acting like big super hero's."
1,You'll feel like YOU are the last of the living,"I'm still not sure what I just watched. I thought ""Last of the Living"" was a horror comedy...but there wasn't a thing funny about it. So, if you take it for its horror value, there wasn't a thing horrific about it either. So what do I think? Nothing. It's not a movie that makes you think...it just stinks. If you're a true horror fan...AVOID it. If you're numb and out-of-it, this will suit you just fine. It will make you feel like YOU are the last of the living. 1 star for its attempt to get 2."
2,Wow,This movie is just horrible. I would rather sit in an enclosed space while someone scratched a plate with utensils while at the same time a soiled diper and dead skunk excretions were pumbling me and some gets in my mouth and my eyes were stabbed with needles. This film was a pain to all five sense. I believe my IQ has dropped from watching this. There was one part were I almost chuckled but they ruined it with their failed attempt at acting.
3,Okay B-zombie flic?,"was okay? not good, not bad? decided to keep this in my home collection though.. maybe rent first??"
3,Lower your expectations.,"Very poorly made, very cheap. If you've seen the rest this is a decent flick, I would never say it's great, but for what it is I actually liked it somewhat. The actors were pretty funny considering what they were working with, wouldn't mind seeing their next project."
3,Fun Zombie Flick in the Vein of Shaun of the Dead,"I really enjoyed this jaunty and campy New Zealand zombie movie. It was very entertaining and the performances seem genuine in their desperation and hilarity. The film making is well done, with some stand out cinematography from Kirk Pflaum. You really feel that the characters are inhabiting a newly created ghost town, a city where humanity simply ceased to exist. It is an unnerving place to be and you feel that there could be threats around every corner. This creepy feeling coupled with the comedic quips of the characters makes for a very realistic and humanistic approach to the typical zombie film. My one complaint it that the end of the movie seems to lose focus and direction and feels very bleak."
1,Another Zombie Disappointment,Besides The Horrible Music in This Movie the Acting Was Sub Par as Well as The Movie Itself. It Was a Long Boring Journey to Nothing. What a Waste Of Time and Money. Don't Bother With This One. If Your Looking For a Good Zombie Flick Then Watch Return of The Living Dead or Night of The Living Dorks.
3,Wasn't what I expected,"This movie wasn't what I expected it to be but I got it for cheap. As always, you get what you pay for."
3,Last of the living? not exactly...,"Ok, sadly the only really interesting thing about this movie is the jacket cover. This -B grade zombie wanna be flick is trying to rip off too many films at once, and doesn't succeed at any. It wants to be Shaun of the Dead, Bad taste and a dose of Mad Max. Save your money, and buy popcorn for the next zombie movie."
2,Great movie for naps,If you want to take a nap this movie is a must see! Works better than a warm glass of milk with a side of turkey.
4,You gave our only parachute to a zombie?!?!?!,"I enjoyed this movie. The characters were likeable and felt like real people. It was funny. The story went somewhere. It's true, the special effects would not have been good enough for 1970s Dr Who, but who cares! This was a fun movie. The soundtrack was pretty good too.There's something about the end of the world which brings out the immature side of people and they used that here. They glorified in it!My biggest complaint was that the story never really ended. They just stopped telling it. That's cool if there's a sequel, but if not that's a bummer.I'd like someone to give the people who made this a real budget and then we'd see what they could do."
2,Only for die hard zombie fans,"You should only get this movie if you are a die hard zombie fan or a library completion. The movie over all was bad, but i have seen worse. there was very little gore and blood for being a zombie movie, and make up on some zombies was almost non existent. The acting was ok, but at times it seemed like dialogue was missing, and i really thought that there should have been more emotional moments especially when the friends die.SpoilersSpoilersSpoilersThe ending is bad, i mean really bad..the island is broadcasting a do not come here message but no one in the plane picks it up...in the end everyone would have just been better off staying where they was eating pop rocks and playing video games, and just living out there life in an uber mansion bachelor pad. Really poor ending...really poor."
5,An excellent guide to a little-covered country,"From Roast Turkey with Persimmon, Sausage and Jalapeno Stuffing to Mango Pudding and Chicken in Sherry Wine, Argentina Cooks! is packed with fresh new explorations of the entire country's unique cuisine. Chapters are organized by region of Argentina, but this also offers a handy index for those who want to choose dishes by ingredient. An excellent guide to a little-covered country."
5,Perfect Fit,A perfect fit for my 2005 Corvette Coupe. There's a noticeable reduction in interior heat with this in place and it also serves to limit the interior UV exposure. The item itself is quality American design and construction.
3,Uneven but...........,"There is some great stuff on here.The two hits here are very nice songs but I tend to lean more towards Livin on my own,Readyand Rock and a hard place,as my favorites on this disc.I think I finally figured out why they called this disc One Eighty,because after each song they turned their direction for their next song a 180 degrees in another direction.(yes ,no, maybe).This is still a very professional album."
3,Besides the album cover...,"This album was good. Two popular songs in ""You're the Only Woman"" and ""Biggest Part of Me"" alone make this a winner. My personal favorite is ""Cryin in the Rain"", rockin' song with a killer organ solo. I really wasn't aware of Ambrosia's ""rock power"". The album cover is quite controversial, the back is even worse. In my younger days, I thought Janet from ""Three's Company"" was the lead singer, with a cast of some tough truckers. Either way, the album was good then and now."
3,"Evolution, perhaps...","Like the Yes albums of the 1980s, this project is best heard in it's own context, not in view of all that came before. The addition of Royce Jones and David Cutler-Lewis improves the level of creativity which is often lost as bands develop, normally resulting in a less homogenous sound throughout the album. I must admit I was quite disappointed with this album, in the wake of their first two efforts. ""One-Eighty"" is a definite departure from their prog-rock beginnings, although some echoes of their earlier style can be heard in ""Kamikaze"" (sung, incidentally, by Joe Puerta, the principal vocalist on the first albums). Hopefully, this album suceeded in bringing new listeners to their earlier music, as was the case with listeners to Yes' ""90125"" and ""Big Generator"". All in all, not a bad album. Worth buying."
5,Takin' me back,"What a great CD. A little bit of everything--from the Top 40 hits ""You're the Only Woman"" and ""Biggest Part of Me"" to my favorites that most people have never heard like ""Shape I'm In"" and ""Livin' On My Own"". David Pack has a great voice and after 20+ years I still love this music! If you're feeling nostalgic for the late '70's and early '80's, and you like groups like Pablo Cruise or maybe early Toto, I think you'll like this cd."
2,Dyed,"I bought 3lb of brown microcrystalline, and I'm pretty sure what I received was white wax, dyed brown. This makes it stiffer to work with and it melts strangely.Would not buy again"
2,Not the practical guide I was hoping for,"I was hoping to get a book that gave me some practical steps and references in order to achieve the energy independence I desire. Instead, it was a book of theoreticals and broad ranging ideas. When I think of a guide, I think of a ""how to"" manual. This book is anything but that. If you're looking for a book that scratches the surface on the topic, in an attempt to learn more about the concept of energy independence, then have at it. If you want something meatier, look elsewhere."
2,So-so,"I found this book rather disappointing, having expected more nuts-and-bolts details on how to get off the grid. A lot of the book is just rehash of stuff we've all read before (including a 9-page speech by a politician... ho-hum!) and there are many errors. Compact fluorescents don't cost $11 (it's closer to $5). The discussion of hybrid cars is confusing (the ""payback times"" are largely meaningless and compare apples with oranges). I'd have liked some information on the complicated tax credits for hybrids in this year's law. Having said all this negative stuff, I'll give the book credit for being a convincing ""pep talk"" for getting active in energy conservation. It nudged me into stocking up on compact fluorescents, which will pay back the price of the book in a few months!"
4,"a sound , basic overview.",This is a great book for those who are looking at this topic for the first time. I wld recommend it to those who have just developed an interest in this area. It gives a basic overview & should wet the tastebuds for more - further information & weblinks are given in the back.
2,"basic introduction not ""guide""","This book is good for someone who needs an introduction to the ideas of energy conservation and alternative energy technologies. It gives an overview of the basics. It's an easy read and helpful to give you an idea of what is out there.That said, I was hoping for a bit more depth and technical information. Most of the book seemed very superficial just giving you the most basic information about the technologies and not delving into the nuts and bolts, exploring research or providing examples of unique ways people have used these technologies (a few examples are given but they are not particularly informative or interesting).Again, this is basically just an introduction and most of the information you can find on the net."
2,Shallow,"A book with a political agenda: Very much a tree hugger view of energy, global warming, etc. Several good points on wind, wood, micro-hydro, and solar plus heavy emphasis on flat out conservation. Biodiesel, Ethanol, coal, and shale were either barely covered or not covered.I got a big laugh out of the ""artist's rendering"" of off shore windmills as viewed from Ted Kennedy's vacation home. Of course, Ted used his clout to kill it. Tree hugging, global warming concerns only go so far!"
2,Not fond of the scent,"This lotion has a light floral fragrance that reminds me of Grandma - very old-fashioned smelling. It takes a bit to rub in, but has a nice creamy texture. It does leave your skin quite soft. Too bad I can't get beyond the sickening floral scent."
4,Great lotion...but smell changed,"I've been using this lotion for three years and late last year, the odor went from almost unscented to a glue-like or plastic smell. I'm not sure why. The bottles with the newer style dispenser (flat top) has this strange smell. The bottles with the older-style dispenser, as depicted in Amazon's photo, doesn't exhibit the strange odor."
5,Fast shipping! Great product! Thanks!,Great lotion with the light scent of sandalwood! It's not at all greasy and I love it! Goes great with the soap! Makes your skin beautiful as well!
1,NOT unscented,"I was trying to get an unscented lotion for at work, since I tend to work in a group setting and wanted a lotion that would not have a smell that is offensive to my coworkers. I ordered this one and was VERY disappointed when I tried it the first time - it STINKS in a way that is much more offensive than my old scented lotions. I plan on trying to return it, and if I can't, I will simply throw it away. Very disappointed - based on the positive reviews, I expected something much better."
1,Run from this,"I originally bought this product from Wholefoods and loved it....they no longer carry it. I decided to order the same product from the manufacturer, the product smelled rancid and was gummy, I called the manufacturer customer service (Aubrey Organics)... they totally understood and told me they just recently changed some of the ingredients in the product and that they were receiving complaints. I wish there was a rating lower than one star :("
4,Soothing Lotion,"This lotion feels good on my skin, but it has an odd odor. I may order it again, but will not use before I go to bed because that when I smell it on my skin the most."
3,Great for dry skin,"The product is great but the pump never worked, had to find another pump from some other item. Disappointed in the pump aspect but product is good."
3,formerly excellent product,"I've used the Carex cane tips for about 3 years now, and my mother used them for several years before that. The product is of good appearance and historically quite durable, lasting months between replacements. The last five tips I've used have lasted only a couple of weeks each before throwing the metal insert then breaking through so that the metal of my cane is in contact with whatever surface I'm walking on. An additional difficulty is that there is no way to predict the event. I've tried checking the tread to no avail. Twice the tip is still gripping smooth surfaces like a suction cup when I leave the house and completely gone before I get home that same day.This is not acceptable! I'm going to have to find a different solution."
1,Book is extremely out-dated,"because this book covers so much current information, it may have been useful when it was written (around 1998), but no longer."
1,"I would rate this a ""sell""",I bought this book hoping to learn some real insights. What I learned is that this author doesn't understand the business.
2,Didn't want it,"Amazon mis-directed me to this book, apparently, because why on earth would I want a molecular biotechnology book from 1994???It's insane. So I sent it back."
1,Do not buy under any circumstances!,"This review is actually for the fully upholstered green gingham rocker/ottoman combo by Jardine. I don't see it here on the internet, but it looks very much like this one and the ottoman is the same. I had this chair/ottoman delivered to me THREE times, and all three times it was broken. It is a cheap piece of garbage and I am just trying to save others the time and frustration it cost me. The wood under the chair was splintered, there was a horrible grating sound when I tried to rock in it, and it didn't fit together right. I loved the look of the chair, but it is simply not a good piece of furniture. Invest in something else that is safer and better built."
4,Love it!,"I really love this locket, but it is smaller than I had anticipated it being. I didn't look at the specs closely, I guess. It is smaller than the size of a dime...actually, it covers Eisenhower's head and that is about it. So it is quite small, and I don't know if there is anything that will actaully fit inside the locket, but I really do love it. The clover looks like it is real, so I thought that was cool too. I would buy it again given the chance, but I would like it a little more if it was just a bit bigger."
2,"very cute, but not well made.","My father bought this for my daughter for a Yule gift. It was lovely, and she couldn't wait to wear it. Unfortunately, when she tried to open it the four leaf clover part popped off. The part went missing, and now we have a blank locket with a glue spot.If it had stayed together I would have given it a four to 5 star rating. It is a very cute piece that is perfect for a young lady."
3,Ok for the price,"I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted a locket. It is extremely small, and basically a persons head cut out of a wallet sized picture MIGHT fit in it. But she loves it. I've been told that it closes tight enough so that water doesn't get into it if you forget to take it off, and it does look nice.The chain is very weak, broke the first day. We just went and bought a cheap chain (you can get chains for like $3 at superstores), so it really wasn't a big deal."
1,"sure, now that it's $20 I guess...","a friend of mine gave one of these to me randomly after a road trip. to be quite honest, I thought it was a gas station souvenir, because it was so cheaply made, but I loved it! it's tiny, delicate and adorable...and sitting in my car in a cup holder since the chain broke after wearing it for 2 days."
2,four leaf clover,"not worth the money spent, cheap chain, will be removing and replacing it with a more attractive and sturdier chain"
1,Chain broke on the first day,I bought this necklace as a gift for my sister. The chain is very thin and it broke the first day she wore it. The pendant is nice but hardly serves its purpose without a necklace from which to hang.
1,Sterling Silver???,"I had this item on my wish list and was very excited when someone purchased it for me, however after wearing it for a few short hours I found that this was not something to be happy about. I am very sensitive to metals but since this was sterling silver I thought that it would be ok, however I broke out in a really awful rash and now have a necklace that I can no longer wear. So basically BUYER BEWARE! Don't make the mistake I made and end up like me!"
5,i love this,i love this it is helping my daughter to gain weight and i will keeping on using it as long as she needs it i am happy amozon has this for a good price
4,One of the Best... maybe,"I should say... Shampoo should have figured out by now that Ranma isn't in love with her!! And never will be... or will he? In the first episode, Shampoo buys ""the red string of fate"", that will make Ranma love her forever! poor Ranma. I was laughing my head off through half this episode, but it also has a more touching side. Akane show how much she actually cares about Ranma, and she'd suffer if he married someone else. (""It's like a bad dream that I can't wake up from"") But never fear Ranma fans... Shampoo's plans are foiled once again as AKANE comes to Ranma's rescue. We also see how Ucchan actually also thinks of Ranma as a friend.. (""I would be the first one to wish Ranma happiness if it was true love!"")...The second episode was somewhat disappointing. Mousse finally snaps after Shampoo's millionth insult, and decides to leave for China. Obviously he doesn't... but what does he do? A must have for any Ranma fan."
5,Possibly the best short stories I have ever read.,"Zweig was one of the greatest writers (an Austrian) of the first half of the XXth century, yet not well known in this country. In this book there are five short stories, psychological thrillers (each approximately 40 pages long),told in an unusual way, brilliantly. The first story ""The Royal Game' (original title: The Chessnovella) is one of his greatest works. I could not put it down. The last story, ""Letter from an Unknown Woman"",is so unusual that I cannot find words to adequately comment on it in this space. The other three stories are of no less quality. - This book is not for somebody who is speed reading through books while waiting for a bus, yet it is easy reading. Don't read more than one in one sitting. Let the story and the style sit in and remain with you for a while. It will be worth your while."
4,It is what it says it is,"This is a good workbook for introducing sentence-combining into a high school English class. The first half of the book uses sentence combining to introduce/review the writing process, offering students ""invitations"" to write based on the exercises. The exercises themselves are often topical, and the writing invitations generally ask students to write about themselves and their experiences. The second half of the book uses sentence combining to review grammar, including the parts of speech, usage, clauses and phrases, and punctuation.My only criticism of the Toolbox is that it is perhaps too ambitious. By trying to be all things, I felt it does not provide enough depth, especially about the writing process (compared to, say, Writers Inc). Of course, if you wish to use it as a supplement to your classroom instruction, it is more than sufficient."
1,Worst phurchase!!,"I wish I had listened to this comment! I still bought this one after I read this comment and now I regretted it. Actually it is even worse than this review. I got the product, took it out and was glad to see that there was no animal hair. I washed it and then the problems come out. First, the fiber came out as red fiber-balls and scattered all around, on my cloth, on the carpet, on any surface. Then I try to fit it onto my duvet, and this movement made more fiber-balls coming and even the fiber-dust everywhere--on the desk nearby, on the computer screen, on any surface--even on the screen of my alarm clock on the side table. I literally hate the mess it created and decided to packaged it back after all the effort I made. And now I need to vacuum my carpet and wipe away the dust."
1,Blah CD,"With the great talent Mr.Armstrong has,you think he would've applied it here,too.I was deeply disappointed in this CD-it's bland and the songs seem to be rushed through.Another major gripe is the extra syllables added to ""Chim-Chim Cheree"" and ""Zip-a-de-doo-dah""-it made it very difficult to understand or enjoy the song.Mr.Armstrong-it seems that you left your talent elsewhere while making this CD.If you want great stuff by Louis Armstrong,then you're better off with his other CDs.If you want a great Disney CD,then look elsewhere."
3,Esoteric? No - just really weird.,"One of Louis Armstrong's talents was to turn an otherwise unremarkable song into a classic. Unfortunately, his talent is stretched to the limit here by some kitschy arrangements and overwrought vocal accompaniment. Satch still manages to shine in a couple of numbers, though - notably Chim-Chim-Cheree and the Bare Necessities. I found my copy on sale in a clearance outlet for 99, and thought it was a pretty good deal for one of the stranger jazz albums I've ever heard."
3,Not the Best Satchmo - Not the Best Disney - But Fun,"This CD of familiar Disney songs sung by Louis Armstrong - the late great Satchmo - is not the best performance of his career, nor is it the best Disney disc available. Nonetheless, it is quite entertaing and fun to listen to with or without your children.Don't purchase this if your looking for the best Satchmo performance, or the traditional arrangements of Disney tunes.But if you're open minded and enjoy a little flavor, pick it up as a treat to hear one of the greatest musicians of all time fly through a number of happy tunes in his own special way. Including adding a few syllables to the nonsensical syllable songs ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"" and ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" - still recommended, especially for parents who want to introduce their children to jazz music."
5,Satchmo Does Disney Right!,"My kid loves Disney music and we listen to them constantly in the car. I bought this CD as an alternative to the Disney Collection CDs which we've listened to repeatedly.Well, I listened to it twice before I even had a kid in the car with me. My only complaint is that it's too short. I could listen to this for much longer!"
5,EXCELLENT PLAYING!!!!!!,"The title track (Hocus Pocus) is still a reference instrumental piece among musicians who know what they're doing! FOCUS is living proof that good playing alone makes ""meaningful lyrics"" not really a necessity to entertain a listener."
3,Funny but dated,"This collection of seven short stories was first published in the seventies though the stories themselves first appeared in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" magazine in its glory days. The stories are packed full with interesting ideas and they are often very funny. Having said that, it is important to point out also that modern readers will find that the stories themselves have a rather dated feel. The author's novels have stood the test of time far better than have his shorter works.My favourite story from the collection is ""Allamagoosa"" which projects a ""Sgt Bilko"" view of military life into a future of interstellar space ships and hyperspace drives. The stories are not all humorous: ""Ultima Thule"" lands its protagonists in a pretty bleak scenario with no light relief.If you are a fan of period SF, then you may well enjoy this but, if you are new to the author, I'd suggest that you try some of his novels first. ""Wasp"" and ""Three to Conquer"" would be a good place to start."
1,Will not ship to a PO Box,Will not ship to a PO Box.This is a major inconvenience to the millions of Americans that use a PO Box for convenience and security.
5,Catchy 70's pop rock,"I first heard of Trickster in my DJ days at WSU back in 1978. I was very excited to get my hands on ""BACK TO ZERO"" way back in '79. The sophisticated pop sound blended with lush orchestration really hooked from the first listen. I highly recommend this album for those who appreciate the likes of Supertramp, Toto and Charlie."
1,Classic videos PEE POOR sound and video quality!,"I was excited to see that some company made the classic videos of Billy Idol on DVD. But I was shocked with amazement that the video and sound quality could be so POOR. It was like watching a bad VHS tape on a 1960's TV set with broken speakers. I would STRONGLY advise any one who would want to buy this DVD NOT to. It is not worth the money even if it was free!!! unless you're blind and deaf, then it would not matter. WHAT A SHAME!!!!"
2,disgusted,"FIRST OF ALL A COMPLETE IDIOT COULD TELL THAT THIS WAS RECORDED FROM A VHS TAPE ,YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE TAPE JUMP IN CERTAIN SCENES.THE SOUND QUALITY IS LOW GRADE ,I HAVE ONE OF THE BEST SOUND SYSTEMS OUT THERE ,MICK JAGGER WOULD BE IMPRESSED,SO DO NOT BUY I REPEAT DO NOT BUY."
1,Very disappointed !!!,"I wasted a lot of time and money on this useless program. If you'll notice, most of the positive reviews were BEFORE they actually tried the program. So, those were ratings of how excited they were about the program as opposed to how well the program actually works. Save your money - this is no miracle cure."
1,No results,"Unfortunately, I got no results with this program, despite taking inordinate amounts of supplements and being on it for 4 months."
4,Nothing new but reinforcing,"I haven't found any new discoveries in this book. Pretty much all the obvious facts you hear on Dr. Oz or read in beauty magazines. Most of the points I follow already but still have some cellulite and the battle never ends. The vitamins/supplements, the water, the antioxidants, the exercise, the healthy diet, the skin brushing. All of the same known things. It's nice though to recap everything for reinforcement and reminder and tweak regime here and there. A few recipes are helpful too as I often draw blank in the cooking department. But that's about it. it's helpful to learn the science behind the how cellulite appears but still I have not discovered anything radically new."
2,Nothing new,"I do not know what I was expecting when I bought this book. I learned nothing new what so ever. Pretty much you follow the same diet that it is good for your health....low fat meats, veggies, and fruits....wow! It also tells you that you need to exercise and moisturize and take a few supplements. I already eat healthy and do not really have a major problem with cellulite, I just thought I read about it for preventative reasons since I am getting older. Unfortunately I did not read about any new breakthrough treatment or anything else for that matter. In other words if you know nothing about nutrition maybe it is O.K. but for anyone else that has taken at least one nutrition or personal health class it is a waste of time and money."
4,Hard to find all the recommended supplements,"Book is good and Dr. Murad gives good advice, along with a strong rationale to back it up. However, unless you feel like shelling out $125 a month on supplements from the Murad brand, it is hard to find the supplements."
3,"Nice Item, but not Essential",This is a nice item for the afficionado or collector. Compared to some of the other accessories I found this one to be less useful and interesting. It goes into detail about a number of slave tribes in different regions of Athas and provides some interesting leads on how you might use them in a campaign.
2,Her parents' music or their record collection?,"To give credit where credit is due: a suspiciously large number of songs on this album are also included on an old Kossoy Sisters album, ""Bowling Green"" (recently reissued in CD format). It's nice to have new versions of the songs, anyway, but the ""my Appalachian roots"" stuff and the twang -- sorry, Kristin, liked you better bipolar -- seem pretty suspect."
2,Quality issue,"My daughter had a pair of these for over a year. When she outgrew them, we ordered another pair. The sole on one slipper ripped after <10 uses, so I returned the latest pair. I would've given this one star, but the first pair was just fine."
5,Great Slippers!,"I'm surprised to hear these fell apart on someone. We bought these about 5 months ago and they get worn frequently. They have a nice rubberized sole, wash well (we don't put them in the dryer - we air dry) and they keep our daughters feet super warm (she wears a 13-1) and the sole is great for our hardwood floors and stairs. No slipping. Highly recommend these for quality & functionality (and cuteness of course :)"
1,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with these slippers. After a few weeks of wear, they fell apart. We have the ""puppy"" slippers as well from the same company and they did the same thing. It's too bad because they were very cute."
4,Crafts and Craft Shows,"Very good info in this book. Should be read by anyone thinking about doing craft shows or even selling craft in shops, etc."
2,Adjectives without enough detail,"I dislike purchasing books that offer more in the title than they deliver. I would have preferred more specifics in this book than narrative generalities. B/W photos were poor. The promised section on booth design left me with more questions than answers. This book offers nice filler information, but if you're looking for nuts and bolts, look elsewhere."
5,"Wow, this is an EXCELLENT DVD!!","First off, if you're an ECW fan or want to get introduced to ECW, buy this NOW!! Some of ECW's greatest matches are on here including two of the best wrestling matches ever which are RVD vs Jerry Lynn for the tv title and Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka for the heavyweight title. A few other great matches included on this DVD are the never before seen barbed wire match between Raven and the Sandman as well as one of the Dudley Boys's last matches in ECW which pitted them against Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley (Spike gets powerbombed through 2 flaming tables, UNBELIEVABLE!!). Other classic matches include Sabu vs Taz, The Eliminators (Saturn and Kronus) vs Dr.Death and Terry Gordy, and the mixed tag team match between Tommy Dreamer and the beautiful Beulah vs Shane Douglas and Francine. Joey Styles is of course doing the commentary (the best commentator in wrestling, BAR NONE) which only adds more greatness to these matches. Buy this now or you'll regret it later!"
3,Great video but not ecw's best.,I have seen many ECW pay per views and matches to say that this video is fair to good but it is not hardcore! The only match that is close to hardcore is The Raven vs. Sandman barbed wire match. And the Awesome vs. Tanaka match is good but he others are too much WCW look a like.
3,"Good history lesson, but quality is somewhat low","With a few exceptions, this was a good DVD. I'm giving it three stars for:- The Perry Saturn Match that was totally lame- The insane amount of time RVD spends pointing to himself, plus why the hell doesn't Jeri Lynn point the crap out of him and get on with the match?- The ridiculous cheese grater and staple gun crap- The bad recording quality of some of the matches - more than one match does not have the ring miked, and it makes the match look incredibly lame. Miking the ring is key to selling professional wrestling.- The commentary during matches is really bad.Despite all that, there's some great bumps and some great matchups. I probably wouldn't buy another ECW DVD, simply because I don't find it that rewatchable, but I'd rent any others if I could."
4,"""Extreme"" but not ""Hardcore""","ECW is known for its' great athletes, death-defying matches, and great angles. With a HUGE selection of matches to choose for the greatest ones of all, ECW did a pretty good job but could have been better. I think all the matches were great but they could have added a match like the Sabu/Funk Born to be Wired match to top it off. Overall, an outstanding movie and I think its' a must have for any ECW fan."
5,great video,In an era where WWF became a cartoon network. And Hogan ruined WCW. Everyone didn't notice how great ECW was. This tape is awesome!!! Raven vs Sandman in barbed wire was great both men risked their lives. They put on a great match RVD vs Lynn was awesome. Even though I have that match from the Hardcore Heaven 99 ppv. It was still a great stiff match. Awesome vs Tanaka was damn good match I have that ppv also. Beulah and Dreamer vs Douglas and Francine was damn riot!!!!!. That match was so wild a fan hits Douglas with a steel chair. I didn't really like the Eliminators vs Gordy and Williams Saturn's elbow drop was great though. I recommend this tape ECW in 95 and 96 was great!!! I would recommend any of their tapes. ECW is great athletes hardcore action and great wrestling.
1,i was bored,"im sorry to say i was really disappointed by this tape. i've seen better ECW matches on their weekly tv program it seems. not that there isnt some crazy stuff on here, because there is. the RVD match is good after they waste 15 minutes at the beginning doing nothing. some other highlights, but still, not alot of flow to this disjointed tape. also the ecw website says that ALL tapes (uncensored and censored) would show some biographies and the match where chris benoit broke sabu's neck... but neither of these things were on the tape... kinda false advertising. anyway, ecw owes me on this. i'm a disappointed fan."
5,ECW is the better than WCW,This ECW video is the Bomb. And I mean an AWSOMEBOMB. ECW is the best for EXTREME WRESTLING
2,At least the Heart Was there,"After watching the heavily hyped Extreme Evolution on VHS I have to say, color me unimpressed.RVD is a terrible wrestler and anyone who could see through his unnecessary flippity flops before EVERY MOVE, could see that. The ""Vandaminator"" is the stupidest wrestling move ever. He throws a chair at his opponent, who catches it, and then the guy just holds it in front of his face while Van Damn kicks it. Try a little suspension of disbelief guys!The rest of the movie is pretty mediocre, with the good parts being Mike Awesome's match, and the old clips of when they had actual good wreslters like Benoit. The rest is just watered down BS that they want to make a cheap buck off of. It's definately not classic. Pass this by."
1,Do not buy this tape,This tape has no good matches on it at all. Most of the matches are with wrestlers with no talent or past their prime.
3,"A nice complement, a better sequel...","What fun, I am a motorcyclist and enjoyed their trials and tribulations, the attention they bring to the suffering in Africa, but it did get a little long. Charley & Ewan learned a bit from their, ""Long way Around"" vid, better filming, better editing, but they still seem a little whinnie to me. All in good fun, good adventures, and makes a great gift for the avid cyclist in your family."
4,Long Way Down -- Another Great Trip,"I watched the Long Way Round and really enjoyed the first outing with Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman. I was thrilled with the announcement that they would be doing it again! If you enjoyed Long Way Round, you will enjoy Long Way Down.I gave Long Way Down 4 stars for 2 reasons -- it felt rushed and it only clocked in 6 episodes when Long Way Round had 10 episodes and wasn't as rushed. Secondly, I wasn't all that thrilled with Mrs. McGregor joining the boys in Malawi. Do not get me wrong, I love Ewan and his wife seems like such a doll! But for me, the Long Way series is about Ewan and Charley. I felt a little weird with the addition of Ewan's wife, even if it was only for 2 weeks. Despite some of my ""issues"" with the Long Way Down -- I do recommend it if you loved Long Way Round. It's a great addition to the Long Way series (let's hope they do a Long Way Up!)."
2,Not as good as the first one,"Long Way Down - Complete Series [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Australia]I was excited about this one after seeing the first one (The Long Way Round), but I was really disappointed to see that there were only 6 episodes on this disk as opposed to the some 10 - 12, maybe more on The Long Way Round.This one was rushed and I can understand that Ewan McGregor had other obligations to meet, but what a disappointment this one was!Hoping they do a Long Way South through South America because quite frankly, this one sucked a fat one."
5,Long Way Series,"If you enjoyed Long Way Round, you'll enjoy Long Way Down, the second video in the series by Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman.Boorman also has a video out covering his Dakar race attempt and this is what prompted Ewan and Charlie to do the LWD Trip down through Africa. The Dakar video is pretty intense and focused down and in on the race course, and the spectacle of the race.LWD strikes a good balance between riding and sightseeing/sidetrips, again similar in style to Long Way Round. A bit more detail in this one on trip planning, logistics, supplies, and prep.BTW, the BMW GS bikes appear to do incredibly well for the level of punishment they take -- chewing up a few shocks as you might expect, but that's about it for repairs (at least from what they show in the video)."
5,Will make you want to see Africa for yourself!,"This was a very entertaining series-and,as an American, probably the only way I'll ever see Libya and the Sudan. Sometimes sobering and heartbreaking, especially in Rwanda, this is still a very positive picture of Africa.MacGregor and Boorman are often hilarious, and I disagree with another reviewer who said MacGregor failed to connect with the people. He came off as a regular guy. Better looking than most, even covered in mud, but a regular guy. And, at the very least,I'll be sure to buy fair trade coffee from here on out."
5,Another Excellent DVD for the armchair traveller,I loved this and am awaiting for another installment from Ewan and Charlie. Likeable guys with a great team.
1,Don't Buy - The Long Way Down,"I have ordered this DVD from two different companies now - ordered NEW DVDs and they shipped me copies that don't play on my player. With this company I now have to pay for shipping to return it to the U.K. I thought it was comining from North Carolina where they also have a facility. In addition, I paid for a new DVD, was sent a copy, and my charge was never adjusted for a ""used"" version. Forget ordering this item on Amazaon!"
1,Can't Stand McGregor!,"The motorcycle adventure is fine, but with Ewan McGregor its sleezy punch line after sleezy punch line. He does not seem to connect with, or respect, the places and people he encounters. McGregor makes the film series into a celebrity walk about, where every moment he's on film he's trying to charm the hell out of you. I can't stand it! I'd recommend the GlobeRiders filmsGlobeRiders IndoChina Expeditionas a more interesting and exciting adventure."
3,Better than most TV shows,I thought this version wasn't as raw as Long Way Round. Still entertaining just more commercialized.
4,An enjoyable and engaging video with amazing scenery and storyline,"My wife and I love to travel and so this DVD was too tempting to pass up. It is not formatted for North America and so our DVD player would not play it, but I set it up on my laptop, added some good speakers and we settled in for a great visual and narrative journey from London to South Africa.Much of the dialog and visuals are recorded conversations and comments from helmet mounted cameras and microphones and so are at times muffled, but the gist of what they are saying and the accompanying images are more than explanatory. Their well recorded encounters with Rawandan holocaust survivors and other nationals as they travel are moving and powerful in many cases.I recommend this series if you love travel, especially motocycle travel, as well as their Long Way Around Series(even better!). WARNING - there is a fair amount of coarse language and so this is probably not appropriate for younger children."
2,Confusion and disappointment in _Shadow_,"This is the first Caldecott Award book that I would not put on my kid's bookshelves. After reading the story twice my friends and I still couldn't make heads or tails out of what was going on. The text seems to be a bit much for young children and although the illustrations are bold, they carry an almost scary/evil feeling throughout much of the book."
2,My kids didn't like it.,"I have a 5 and 8 year old and I'm constantly looking for interesting books to spark their interest. I bought this one on the strength of the reviews. Yes, the art is amazing and my kids liked looking at the pictures. But the text simply does not make sense to children. This is not a storybook. It is really a fairly abstract poem or prose-poem set against fairly abstract art. This, for my family, was not a successful combination for grade-school level readers. Shadow may be one of those books that works better as a ""children's book for adults."""
2,Disappointing,"This book isn't meant for children, in my opinion. As an educated adult I found it overwhelming and had no idea what was going on. The illustrations are interesting, but that's about it. Not even sure what the author is trying to say about a shadow. If you're into the abstract, go crazy. If not, and you have a child under age 12, don't even bother."
2,shadow,I found this book to be very very weird. It about how a shadow lives and acts. How its around you at all times. How it reacts to the world. Its interesting to read. The book reflects African Culture. So read it
3,All You Need is Luck,"I read it with interest because I am also a New Zealander and have been travelling by way of house / animal sitting in Ireland and UK. I was disappointed, it was pretty average reading."
4,Oh Boy! The Stories He Tells!,"Interesting annectdotes presented in an interesting way. Stories of personal encounters at the intersection of boxing and the underworld, sports and celebrity, television and film. The stories are presented in 66 letters from Conrad to his friend, a UPI correspondent. Only a few of the letters read as if written with publication in mind. The rest are distilled reporting and commentary on notable people of the mid 20th century, from a perspective of a sports writer, film writer, promotions man and bringer of people together.Mobsters, boxers such as Liston and Ali, celebrities such as Bogart and Huston, writers such as Mailer and Wolfe all appear in Conrad's letters to his pal Muffo.This book is definitely worth a read."
4,Enjoyable Workouts,"I found Jari Love's workouts last year and have picked up quite a few of them. I really enjoy the strength workouts and how they make you feel. While you are doing the workout, it didn't really feel difficult, but I definitely felt it the next day! I highly recommend all of Jari's workouts!"
3,Serves its purpose,"It works, I mean its only a washer pump but mine was leaking and since this came with the rubber grommet it was a plus but still leaks so grommets aren't that great."
3,Works but noisy,"I purchased this for a 1994 Chevy S10 Blazer, to replace the rear window fluid pump which had gone out. This pump was a breeze to install, and worked right away. My only complaint is that it is pretty loud when operating. But for the price, not really a big deal!"
2,FM AND AM ANTENNAS,"I TOO AM HAVING PROBLEMS RECIEVING BOTH AM AND FM STATIONSAND I ALSO TRIED VARIOUS ANTENNAS WITH NO LUCK. THIS IS SERIOUS,AS IT IS A BIG PART OF WHY I BOUGHT THE MACHINE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I CANNOT RECOMEND THIS MACHINE IF THIS PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED"
3,Having Problems,The only thing I can get to work on the radio is the CD player. The CD player has great sound.The FM Antenna has a lot of static. I bought an amplified antenna by Terk and had to return it. It was just as bad as the FM Antenna. Has anybody found a better antenna for this radio? Where can I buy a mini plug to fit the AUX input? I want to hook up my Sirius radio.
4,good buy for Russophile doctors,"The hospital where I'm an ER doctor has not only elderly Russian patients brought in by family but also visiting Russian doctors. This book is organized by sections (general exam and history, urology, cardiology etc.) so you can either scan it fast before seeing a patient with pelvic pain or memorize the technical terms before chatting with a visiting surgeon. Biggest flaw is the lack of a separate dictionary section, but overall it's a huge help."
4,Everyone should have a pair of red shoes,Such a great looking pair of shoes! A bit hard to walk in at first; the back strap is a bit low on the heel and your heel slips. They are quite comfortable otherwise and when you get used to the heel strap they are great. And such a great dark red color!
3,"Great for leisure, not for work.","Out of the 4 pairs of Clarks shoes that I've purchased, this one was OK, with the 2 excellent pairs and 1 returned. They are very cute, stylish and versatile. As I walked in them, the strap didn't hold my heel in the shoe, so I tightened the strap, but then it felt too tight and pushed my feet a bit forward, causing aching toes. I experienced this for 2 days at work, where I'm on my feet a lot. So I guess the bottom line is that they are great for going out to dinner, movies, etc., but a bit uncomfortable if you're going to be on your feet all day."
3,Bird's sound is bright and controled with the excellent crew,I highly recomend this CD because of the classic sounds of Parker live. The club setting is ideal for the group and gives Parker more vip than the studio. The quality of the recording is OK because one can hear people talking in the background.
5,charlie parker boston 1952,thumbs up all the way.. i love this charlie parker experience and i feel like i am at the high hat with symphony sid and the crowd. this is a keeper and a treasure.
5,"Simple and creative, recipes for each season","I knew nothing about Nigel Slater except from some references from some foodie friends. I bought the book because I liked the premise and the reviews I saw on Amazon. ""The Kitchen Diaries"" is a combination recipe book and slice-of-life biography covering one year's time. Unlike Ruth Reichl's books, Nigel shares the eating and dining practices of anonymous friends and family. His seasonal food and recipes are the stars of this year-long story. The book has some beautiful, yet stark, photographs. They look plain and simple, almost rustic, not artfully arranged or made up. They look genuine and attainable and delicious.And he follows faithfully the idea of having the cuisine follow what is available for the season. This is a wonderful book with simple yet creative recipes."
5,Fun to read and delicious recipes,"Great for those evenings when you need a suggestion of what to have for dinner. Easy recipes, beautiful photos and all we've tried have been delicious."
1,Looking for a Cult and NOT Finding One,"I find it funny that this is released shortly after ABC and CBS did similar pieces on news-type evening shows, and all three tried to prove the same ridiculous issue and failing utterly. The people involved even went as so far as to interview some VERY anti-AA people, people who encouraged moderated drinking instead of abstinence. All 3 shows disregarded the fact that the female co-founder of this group of 'controlled drinkers' KILLED a person in a drunken driving accident, where SHE was the intoxicated one. So, if you don't mind biased, anti-AA sentiment probably based on the writers own fears of their own addictions (which is where we usually see such denial) get this and revel on closemindedness and fear. Maybe they can do an expose' on how Mother Theresa was a man-hating lesbian serial killer when nobody was looking."
1,alcoholics anonymous - investigative reports,This video is obviously produced/sponsered by AA. It does not investigate anything within AA. Everything is just fine with AA.It is a well crafted propoganda piece of the well established AA's brainwashing methods. DO NOT BUY IT!
3,Works well but with a hitch,"This is a great product if you do not want to move the cd player or mp3 player far from the radio you are using to transmit. I use this for my mp3/cd player and my sisters ipod on my stereo instead of wasting batteries on my media speakers and it worked well when I had the transmitter inches from the stereo, anything more than that and it gets very staticky with a lot of white noise. It does it's job but it doesn't do it well"
3,USB Power cord NOT included,The photograph shows a USB power cord; the ARKON SF150A does not include such a cord. Only the ARKON SF150C does.
3,Road Trip,I wished the range to find a empty station was wider. Sometimes I couldn't find a unbroadcasted area from FM88-95.
2,Not recommended,"Analog frequency selection is sometimes a pain.Sound quality over a range of 20 ft is poor, within 20 ft is just ok.Not recommemnded I guess....Finally stopped working after 2 months, returned to amazon for a partial refund"
2,The only reality - a nailgun.,"What is appealing about this movie?(1.) A contemporary adaptation of Romeo & Juliet doesn't take much imagination. Is simply having love and tragedy in the same hour the measure of success?(2.) But to do so in a very slow and mundane teen love story that was so trite, humdrum and unreal that one thinks, ""Where was this writer and this director raised - in a cave?"" Family, youth and youth conflict scenes were as real as a '70s sitcom with acting skills just as real.(3.) The two star highlights were the frequent slow panning close-ups of an industrial nailgun. Duh!(4.) Absurd robbery, coverup and revenge sequences that seemed as artificial as a plastic grocery bag."
4,Really good story. Such a realistic story. Definitely not a fairy-tail.,"I liked the actors, some pieces could be expanded upon, and relationships of secondary characters could have been more displayed, but that could have also slowed the story down and make it slow and boring."
5,Taxi'ing for take off,Densil Pinnock is a musician just waiting to take off. Check out his other great recordings under the name Denzal Sinclair! You won't be disappointed.
3,On Densil Pinnock,"I swear to God that I heard him singing Nat King Cole in 1992-93 at the NY subway station right outside Columbia University when I was going to grad school there. If this is indeed true, and if someone can confirm this, then what a story it would be !"
4,Quite a good book for people who like this.,"I thought this book to be a good book for all people. I loked how it helped me understand things that I didn't know about the Mormon. I demand that all people should read this book since all our minds will be opened up to the real issues of the book.I feel scared to read this book because we all need to know about the dangers that are warned. This is heaven, after allKH"
3,Critique,"Pleased with the shipping, which was quick and without delays. But, the print is small and hard to read. I have only finished three chapters at this point, and as an amateur, the book so far, has been rather hard to read, I would compare the book to 'plowing' through the pages.. However, I am hoping things will pick up, and I will find some real nuggets of knowledge eventually."
4,Corny but Worthwhile,"It's not *more* corny than many Educational videos, so it really isn't a deal breaker... but it is a little silly.But, my kids like it, and they learn from it- so mission accomplished."
1,Avoid this rocker,"I hated my total experience with this rocker so I decided to write my first review.I purchased this rocker and the first time I sat in it with my newborn son in my arms, the back cracked. The back support is very flimsy. While this may not happen to you, I do believe the back support is not very strong and will not stand the test of time. I was able to get a good look at it after mine broke and the design is poor.Another cautionary note: This item will be shipped by Eagle Shipping whose tracking system is poor and whose customer service is just as bad."
2,It looks good but...,"I was very taken by this chair in Babies R Us when we registered. It looked cool (or, as cool as a baby rocking chair can look) and after a long day of shopping was quite comfortable.However, after getting it home the euphoria lasted about two days.First, it was the squeaking. Oh, for the love of all things holy, please stop the SQUEAKING!!! At first I tried to readjust the chair. Then it was the WD-40. Then more WD-40. Then I gave up.Secondly, the pad for the chair had a 2 to 3 inch gap on one side.Overall, for the money, this chair should be avoided."
5,It's Great!,"I knew when deciding on the decor of the nursery that I wanted a rocker. I choose this one because I was able to get it in gingham yellow. I couldn't be more pleased. I use it all the time for feedings, especially the middle of the night ones which gives me a comfortable, easy place to go so I don't disturb any one else, especially my husband. I also got the foot stool which makes it even more comfortable. A+ experience!"
2,Not worth the price!,"This rocker is only moderately comfortable, and doesn't seem to be very well-built. The cushions are so soft that they break down over a very short period of time, and sitting in it for more than a few minutes becomes quite uncomfortable. If you want to spend $300 or less on a rocker, you'd do better to buy one from a furniture store. I spent more on a rocker of better quality and am very pleased that I did!"
5,Great pickups!,"I installed the Fender Texas Specials in a Squier Affinity Tele ($160). There is an obvious improvement in tone, response and sustain. The bridge pickup is very ballsy and twangalicious, think Hot Rod Lincoln lead tone. The neck pickup is smooth and buttery and with a Boss Blues Driver it produces the ultimate Sunshine of Your Love fuzz tone. When both pickups are on you get a very balanced tone that works well clean or distorted. I couldn't be happier. I would highly recommend these pickups to anyone wanting to get the most tone out of their Telecaster."
3,Cat loves it.,"Had trouble putting it together. No instructions, had to look at the picture on the outside of the box. Kept falling apart when I picked it up, solved the problem by putting masking tape at all the joints. Frustrating but my cat loves it! That's what its all about, isn't it? She simply loves it."
2,"Falls apart, tippy","This thing might be popular with the cats, but it comes apart too easily and is too unstable to allow them to get into it easily. The idea is cute, but the functionality leaves a lot to be desired. Too many pieces."
1,don't bother,"The whole contraption is unstable, wobbly and certainly does not swing. The canvas has an over-powering smell which cannot be washed off. Neither of my two cats would go anywhere near it."
4,Nice little spot for your cat.,"Cats seem to like to be on top of things. I tried a couple of different cat hammocks. Some of the cheaper ones are just not worth the money. This one has really worked out well though. It gives them a place to snooze which is off the floor but not on the furniture, where they might be disturbed by someone sitting down or getting up. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the pieces don't fit all that snugly together. It's not at all hard to assemble, and it has plenty of support for the cat lying on top of it, but if you pick it up to move it, some of the pieces are likely to become disconnected, so that you have to reassemble it. It's only a minor inconvenience, really. I would still heartily recommend the product to anyone with a cat, especially a young cat. The older ones don't seem to find it worth the effort to climb onto it. Or maybe it's just that the younger ones get to them first."
1,Poor delivery,The seller sent the wrong item and it was very frustrating to get satisfaction. Amazon stepped and settled the problem. We never heard a word from the seller. Scratch them!
1,Yuck!!!!!!!!!,My favorite show but this really stinks Same episodes as other budget releases and picture on the front of the DVD may make you think that the episodes are from season 3 WRONG they're not. true PJ fans that have the first 2 seasons and the ultimate collection don't waste your money or time on this DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Decent, but not spectacular","Definately not up to the standards of theatrical Disney soundtracks, but it's a decent enough CD with listenable songs.The best, in my mind, is ""You're Only Second Rate"" from the Return of Jafar. The other ROJ songs are reasonable, though the CD is missing ""There's Nothing in the World"" for some inexplicable reason."
3,Better then expected,"""Out of thin Air"", ""Forget About Love"", and ""are you in or ou""t hold up quite well on their own, but I find the the other songs rather dull. The score is pretty nice my favorite tracks are ""Magic Carpet"", and ""End Credits""."
4,The original Sound Factory revisited,"I'd read some references to this CD before, but only just found the tracklisting and realized that it's basically an homage to the original Sound Factory on West 27th St in New York circa 1993, with Danny Tenaglia playing records worked by Junior Vasquez when he was still an incredible DJ and the club was still perhaps the best place in the world to go dancing. Even the title is taken from an early Sound Factory classic, ""Work this Pussy"" by Ellis D (Junior's original alias). I'm not a big Danny Tenaglia fan but this is a pretty excellent way to get a flavor of the music that a thousand or so mainly gay people once went wild to until midday Sunday in a dark, sweaty raw warehouse with little more than a big dancefloor, fierce sound system, huge mirror ball & juice bar. Recommended."
3,Not one of her better books,"I was disappointed in this book. It was very depressing at times, not at all like the type of book she usually writes. I read trashy romance novels for just that, trashy romance! This had a little bit of that but not enough to make it a great read."
2,Not one of her best,"The reason I didn't particularly care for The Love Killers was that the characters seemed shallow. I finished the book in two days, so it is a fast paced read, I just didn't bond with her characters. There wasn't enough depth to truly feel like you could 'see' what was going on. I was unable to 'step into the adventure' which I can easily do in her other novels.I still recommend it, but only because it was written by my favorite author!"
3,SHE'S DONE BETTER... MUCH BETTER,A tight plot. Attention to detail. Characters that blaze off the page. Sexy dialogues...What else could you possibly hope for in a book? (except maybe some credibility?)
4,Bought this again - for my 17 year old!,"My daughter asked if she could get this game again! She enjoyed it when she was in grade school but we had problems with the software back then and got rid of it. She says it is so much fun to play AND educational, her favorite is Liberty's Kids! In fact, she knew answers in high school American History class because she played this and remembered!"
1,Don't read it !!,"Don't read this book if you like professional wrestling! This is, in fact, a book for idiots. Reading the sneak preview, I could not help but think that Messieurs Albano and Sugar are the only ""idiots"" in the wrestling field. Trying to be funny, their jokes are characterized by a grotesque sense of humor that would make anyone cry. Being an ex-pro, I feel embarrased at the way they tackle the nature of the otherwise beautiful sport. Not informative and certainly not didactive, I would not even read it in the bathroom."
3,"OK, but outdated in an instant!","This is a good reference for the world of pro wrestling, and I enjoyed the parts about the feuds, the types of matches, the superstars, and several other elements. However, the book is already outdated. For instance, Rocky Maivia is now, of course, The Rock, and The Giant is now The Big Show. If the book were to be rewritten, the authors could add some of the new stars of today, such as Jeff Jarrett, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Sid Vicious, Raven, and The Sandman, among others. Anyway, fair book, and I know plenty more about wrestling than I aleady do."
1,Idiots Guide Is Right!,"This book promises to be neither informative nor entertaining. I would have expected more from Bert and Lou, but not from their writing buddy Woodson. When I looked his name up in books in print, I found that most of his previous books were about plumbing - which in my opinion is why this book will end up in the toilet. Next time they should get someone who knows something about the sport to pen a book about wrestling!!"
2,"Filled with errors, and a poor overview to boot","There aren't that many books about pro wrestling to start with, so when you come across something in the mainstream press, you have to hope for the best. Unfortunatly, The Complete Idiot's Guide is filled with factual errors concerning the history of the sport, not the least of which is poor coverage of the 'fake versus real' issue.If you are seriouis about the history of wrestling, pick of Have a Nice Day or the new Dynamite Kid book instead."
1,"""Idiot's""? Yeah, if you mean the author. Complete garbage!","Lou Albano and Burt Sugar give you all the low down on the wrestling industry, including real names. Did you know that The Rock's real name is Rocky Melvin? I didn't. I bet he didn't either."
2,The Title says it all,"This book is definitely only for complete idiots. There is absolutely nothing of any interest in this book. THey are stories with huge, necessary chunks cut out. And this is all not to mention the grammatical, spelling, and factual errors that you'll be able to find on every other page. If you know nothing about wrestling, then this is the book for you. But If you've been watching for at least 6 months, then there is no point in wasting your money on this book."
2,"Basic, basic, basic","If you're a complete wrestling addict, this book will fail to enthrall you. There are a few nuggets of entertaining information, but for the most part, this book is for people who really don't know much about the world of sports entertainment. The bios on the wrestlers are dated and are angled from the character's aspects, rather than the real life stats of the wrestlers themselves."
2,Pretty awful,"It is quite sad that Lou Albano, who had such long history in wrestling, is apparently clueless as to what the current state of wrestling is about. And what is up with Bert Sugar? I can't stand that guy. His commentary on boxing is horrible, and his commentary on pro-wrestling is even worse. This book is full of grammatical and factual errors remarks. Not recommended for ANY wrestling fan, even the most casual and naive marks."
5,A masterpiece for anyone who truly loves wrestling,I felt the book was rather good. It never badmouthed either of the 2 major organizations. It also never revieled too many secrets of the fakeness. All aroung it was great book.
5,It takes you to Disneyland!,"This is an excellent CD! I have it and listen to it alot! I wish that the songs from the rides were longer, but it will make you appreciate Disneyland more when you get to hear the whole song. It's a Small world and the Tiki Tiki Tiki room are awesome! I think it will be a great additon to your music selection. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
1,Item displayed not correct,"The item displayed and the songs listed are not the correct songs for this album. Got little help from Amazon customer service phone group who said that the seller approved the listing. When asked how 12 different sellers could approve something wrong, the person who was not in the US could not understand the problem. I did get some good advice from the online help person from amazon. Contacted the seller and they said to return which I did but still have not gotten a refund yet. I will give them another week then I will go to my CC company and get them to reverse the charges."
5,Great CD,"I purchased this CD to replace a cassette tape version we have had for many years. Fearing the tape would wear out it took a while to find the CD copy. Excellent condition and fast shipment by the supplier, bookrackmedia. I look forward to ordering from them in the future.Official Album of Disney World"
5,Brings back memories & fills time while waiting to go again,"This CD allows you to ""Remember the Magic"" of Disney World and Land (for those of you who have been fortunate enough to go - and even more fortunate to go to both) and forces you to anticipate returning to the happiest places on earth."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD for the Illuminations soundtrack (before the 25th anniversary one.) Instead, it had the Illuminations 25 soundtrack, and I'm very disappointed because I like the other one better than the 25th anniversary one. Boo on Disney for not specifying that on the CD tracks."
5,:),"Ever since I was a little girl, my family and I would go to Disney World. As I have gotten older, they have changed many of the rides and songs. Now, when I go back, almost everything is different. This CD is great because it brings me back to the many family vacations we spent there. :) Not only that, but it's fun to sing along to with your friends!"
5,Authoritative Parenting gone wrong,This is a great example of parents pushing their kids too hard. Every parent who has a child in sports should be required to watch this.
5,Great Buy,"Bought this for my boyfriend (who is a sneakerhead) and he loves it. High quality print, bright pages, covers many of the classic brands and at an excellent price - best price I've seen for this book and I've looked for it elsewhere. Definetly recommended."
1,Potting soil is actually 3/4 mulch.,"I bought 4 bags of this at Menard's 2 weeks ago and the 1st one I opened contained about 75% mulch, the other 3 bags however were good gardening soil. I needed 2 more bags today and made 3 trips to Menard's and all 6 bags were unusable. Be careful buying this junk, pinch the side of the bag to see if you can feel the mulch in there, it won't feel smooth if it's mulch. The good gardening soil will feel smooth. Don't waste the gas to drive 75 miles for nothing like I did."
5,Jimi at its best,I thought this book was the best Jimi book of all time. I have liked reading and hearing new things about Jimi...I learn new things every day. Read this if you want to know a little or already know stuff about Hendrix
5,Bravura performance!,"For those of us who loved Nancy's Christmas album but worried that her voice was not all we know it can be, our fears are assuaged with this release. Here's Nancy doing what she does best: subtly exploring every nuance of every lyric, yanking every emotion from every song with the assuredness that can only come from a master.And a fine collection of songs it is, with great guest vocalists and top-notch musicians. This is a recording that will be remembered as one of her finest, I think because the songs mean so much to her.Nancy Wilson is an amazing vocalist, truly one of a kind. And if you have never seen her do what she does live, do yourself a favor-she is mesmerizing in concert. (Find live dates at her Web site, missnancywilson.com.)RSVP is a welcome addition to the Wilson collection, one that assures me that this lady has more to sing and a vocal gift that will continue to impress for years to come."
5,Still in Love with Nancy!,"I'll keep my review brief and simple. I've been a fan of Nancy Wilson since the Fall of 1963. It's as if every song she's ever recorded, every live performance she's ever given and every one of her practice sessions for the past forty plus years have been just warm ups to R.S.V.P. Some reviewers are commenting on technicalities of midrange vibratos, etc. That's not the point of listening to a CD (unless you're a professional reviewer which none of us here should be). Every song on this CD is perfection. Her accompanists (both vocal and especially instrumental) are also incredible. I've lost track of how many times I've listened to it (often with headphones to pick up every nuance of her voice). Buy it. Share it. Love it."
1,Dead after storage,I bought this a couple of years ago for emergency use. I tested it when I received it and it looked like it was going to work fine. I put it in the closet and did not use it at all afterwards. A year and half later I plugged it in and even with the power switch in the off position it blows the fuses. Not very good if I neded it for the emergency.I'll try contacting the service center but I don't have the receipt.
2,Iffy at best,"Have had this inverter for about a year, used mostly to run an HP laptop in the car.It's fine when it works. Runs a bit loud but does the job.However, there's been a number of occasions when it would be running, but not conduct power to whatever was plugged into it. (Not overheated or trying to draw too much power, just wouldn't work)Now, it seems to be done for good. Plugged in, it runs but again, won't conduct electricity.There's a tiny green light showing status: Solid when working; flashing when overloaded. Mine is flashing all the time, even with nothing plugged into it.Not a good product, unreliable for sure. And with other reviews I've read, can't say I'll be getting another MAXX product."
1,Worst purchase of the new century,"By far the worst buy of 2008, and certainly the worst of this Century. The inverter won't charge a cell phone, any cell phone and I've tried 3, without shutting off from what is said to be overheating. I hung it over the A/C vent and it helped, gave it about 5 more minutes before it quit. The fan runs constant, regardless of what's plugged in or even if nothing is plugged in, you turn it on, the fan runs and it's loud. This would be tolerable if it helped its overheating problem, but it doesn't.So then after watching my voltmeter bobble when starting it, I checked the current draw. The fan alone, nothing else, nothing even plugged into the sockets, it pulls over 20 amps!!!!!!! For 20 amps, I could put a fan on the radiator and cool the engine.A very poor buy all around, don't go this route, there are good ones out there."
2,you have got to be kidding!!,this is one of the worst ranma videos since great eggspectation i really didnt enjoy this video save your money people but if you really want to collect ranma videos get it ... but in my opinion dont...
4,3 room tent w/ screen porch,The size of this tent is greatly misleading. The tent is 18 ft long if you include the screen porch. But the majority of the sleeping area is only 11 ft. wide. Two rooms come off the back of the tent they are only big enough for 1 sleeping bag. The 16 ft. measurment is taken at the widest point which is where those rooms come off the back sides of the dome. We went camping this past weekend and were cramped in the tent. There are only 5 in our family. With 1 qn mattress and 3 sleeping bags we had to keep all of our clothes in the car. My sister has a 10x14 tent that is bigger inside than this one.The construction is good. The tent did well in the rain. We did not have any leaks.
3,"Begin Love, Later Loathe","We loved this tent when we first got it. It took a little thought process when setting it up, but once you figured it out it was fine. We used this tent almost a whole summer, but the weather had always been mild. We had one day of wind. Not awful wind, but, a good breeze. We snapped two poles, our other tent was not affected. We bought replacement poles (not cheap, but not bad,) set it up again the next summer. They snapped right away too. We were finally gave up and stopped buying poles. We bought a different tent that was cheaper, and haven't had a problem since. I really wish it had worked out better for us though."
3,Its okay,I liked the fact that it was a huge tent with a screen porch area. Though the porch area doesn't have a floor making it easier to track stuff in. The sleeping areas are a bit on the smaller side I think. We have a queen size mattress and it took up one and 1/2 rooms. Took us a while to put up at first. We have only used this tent once and unfortunately by the time we took it out of the box it was way past the exchange time frame and noticed that the 2 back rooms have defective zippers. It took my almost an hour to get the one door shut after use cause you have to do it very very slow and basically start all over if they dont align properly. Though i have been reading a lot about leaking i didn't experience that this trip since we had no rain but will be aware of what may happen. All in all its not too bad of a tent though i think i may look into getting a larger more sturdier tent for my developing family.
1,The tent that almost ended my relationship,"This tent became the most frustrating obstacle on my last vacation. I've been a camper for 23 years and I've never dealt with such a piece of crap.[...] the fiberglass poles broke when we were setting it up. We ended up with a deformed, ramshackle dome with floppy ""rooms"" on the sides to ride-out tornado-spawning weather in the ozarks.My boyfriend was so mad at me for purchasing this tent he nearly left me in Missouri a single woman."
4,Not bad,"I have a few Firm DVDs and do not care for the others, but I do like this one. I have only did it a couple times, but I can tell I will like it for a rotation from my Jari Love workouts.She goes fast with the moves, so it can be frustrating the first time you try it.I also get tired of The Firm's way of trying to get you to buy their equipment. That is part of the reason I dislike the other one's that I have. I just used a broomstick for their ""pole"" and my own step for the ""fanny lifter"" they suggest. I use my weights in place of their ""twigs"" so I was able to modify using those things. LOL"
4,Feeling Good,I enjoy all the firm products. These workouts are good if you still want to work out but don't have the motivation to get to the gym.
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!","After seeing a few of Karen's projects on the Carol Duvall show, I hAD to have this DVD. There are so many adorable, easy-to-to projects on here. I'll admit a few of them took a few tries to master, but the projects are broken down easily and of course, you can pause, rewind, slow ect to make it even easier to pick up. I'd had some origami experience but Karen's DVD shows how to use simple folds to create gorgeous gift items, cards and more. Definitely worth every penny."
3,First-rate interpreter,"Ute Lemper's vocal timbre is not my cup of tea especially, but her interpretive skills are extraordinary. Of the old world, where skill, independence, inspiriation and passion count for more than commerciality and ultimately, plasticity. Check out her work on Kurt Weill and Berlin Cabaret."
5,Weill at his best...,"This album is an ESSENTIAL C.D. for ANYONE with good taste in music. Ute Lemper's wonderfully dramatic voice is highlighted on tracks such as 'My Ship'(a Kurt Weill classic) and 'All That Jazz' (from Lemper's stunning prtrayal of Velma Kelly in the hit musical Chicago). One C.D. surely cannot capture the enormous range of styles that this artist has to offer, but her fresh sound and intensely powerful voice is surely an excellent starting point, a door into the world of Weimar Cabaret (Kabarett), and Kurt Weill."
3,"More fairies, less Doreen!","I bought this hoping to supplement my deck of Healing with The Fairies Oracle cards, which I really like. I had hoped to get more insight into the basis for the cards, what they were about, why they said what they said. This book did include information on contacting fairies, and where to find them, but I felt that the majority of the book was devoted to Doreen's quest for a fulfilling relationship! Her story was interesting and inspirational, but I don't think the amount of time spent on it was appropriate, given the title of the book.That said, this was by no means a bad book, and I did learn a thing or two. Mostly to warn the fairies when you are going to mow the lawn!"
3,Not what I thought,"When I bought this book I htought it would tell me ways to use the Fairie Oracle cards, but it didn't. It was a book about how the fairies affected her life. A nice book but not my type of read."
1,Worthless ramblings.,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. I purchased the angel oracle cards by Ms. Virtue. They are a beautiful oracle deck and I recommend the cards. HOWEVER, this book is like reading a diary of her personal life which is not what I cared to know. I was put off by her constant mention of the other books that she's written throughout this book. This book feels to be written in a rambling, ""crank out another book"" style. I did finish reading it because I wanted to find the reward, but was left flat and upset that I wasted so much time.I completely believe in fairies and angels...because I've witnessed. But this book wasn't helpful at all, unless you want to know about the author's personal life. Hope this review will save your time. I agree with the reviewer from NC."
1,Disappointing,"This book felt more like a long-winded promotion of veganism and animal rights than an exploration of the fairy world. While there were some tidbits of solid iformation, they were difficult to pick out. However, if you're looking for a spiritual autobiography of the author, this is the book you want."
2,"Okay, but some parts were just ridiculous","Like a lot of others that reviewed this book, I thought that I would learn about the faeries and how to see them. It was mostly about the author's life, and although well-written, some parts were just unbelieveable. I mostly enjoyed the book up until she starts weeping because a leprachaun yelled at her because her husband mowed down mushrooms in their lawn.I am a believer of the faery realm and I got this book hoping to gain some insight. However, this book left me feeling a little confused and wondering if the author is a bit schizophrenic."
1,Be forewarned,"Unlike many of Doreen Virtue's books, this is not a book that's spiritually instructive. Rather, it's Virtue's personal account of discovering fairies and her struggles with and explorations of true love. How did this book acquire such an editorial description? There are no step-by-step instructions on how to contact fairies, or ways to work with them personally. And I cannot think of a single case study mentioned. Too, too much time is spent in Doreen's personal life, which I never found enlightening or inspiring. I was entirely disappointed; her publisher did her a disservice, setting up all the wrong expectations."
1,Christianizing New Age,"Title says it all. This book is pure fluffiness and a diary of her life in her opinion. I wanted to read about the Fey and gain more experiance with them, however the mention of Jesus, God, Angels, and the Holy Spirit were on every page. That has no place in new age or with the Fey and it annoys me as a practicing Pagan of eight years to see that in New Age sections. If you really want to read up on Faeries look at Edain Mccoy or Froud. This is meddling, innacurate bull. Don't waste your money!!"
5,Love Fairies? Love this Book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book from the first page to the last page. It is an interesting and insightful story about how Doreen Virtue became involved with fairies, what they taught her, and she even explains how they helped her love life (with the help of angels too).If you enjoy reading Doreen Virtue's books, have her oracle cards, like fairies and angels, this is really a great book to add to your collection. I highly recommend it."
2,Movie dialog ruins this jazz album,I sought out this CD because it contains a couple of songs by Sting not available on any of Sting's CDs.The remaining album cuts are jazz instrumentals. It would have been a fine CD except some person must have decided it would cute to add movie dialog to the intros of must of the cuts.It's not a pleasant experience.
4,Love this CD!,"I first heard this soundtrack when I saw the movie and was mesmerized by the music. I immediately went out and bought it. Of course after letting someone borrow it, I never saw it again. Feels so nice to hear it again. I agree with some of the other posters. Wish there were't so many dialogue tracks... but Sting is worth it!"
4,a great soundtrack,"Leaving Las Vegas was a great movie, simply put. The music, like in all great movies, served to complement the film. The track ""ben and sera"" (the theme) is both beautiful, sad, and moving.""Lonely Teardrops""-to the best of my knowledge- does not appear on the soundtrack. This was a major disappointment. Unsure was this was the case.Excluding the absence of the above mentioned track, the other selections are great!"
3,What Happened,"The soundtrack for Leaving Las Vegas was very good, Mike Figgis is an excellent conducter of the boozy feel of moments better left without lyrics. However, I cannot in good conscience give the soundtrack a higher rating, as the absence of the Michael McDonald version of ""Lonely Teardrops"", used twice in the film to great effect, is not available anywhere, I presume, as I've been unable to track it down. WHY? This song is incredible, and well worth the price of admission. Sting and Don Henley not withstanding, they both are very good, but the absence of Mike on the soundtrack is a Major letdown....if anyone knows how to get a copy of the ""Lonely Teardrops"" version on this movie please let me know...Buk218@aol.com"
3,most key song from Michael - Lonely Tear drops missing?,This is terrible that the key song in the sound track by Michael McDonald - Lonely Tear Drops is missing??Is there another version
4,"Graet Soundtrack, but Mike Figgis BLEW IT....","This is one of the better soundtracks of a rather great movie, with only one problem. The most powerful song of the movie, ""Lonely Teardrops"", re-made by Michael McDonald, is somehow missing from the soundtrack... Not only is this the most powerful song in the movie, but it is the most memorable. This leaves one to ask how it could have been left out of the soundtrack, and why Mike Figgis BLEW IT..."
3,"Great music,poor format","Great music,esp. by Sting.I do not care for the dialog in between songs,it just doesnt belong."
1,The worst grinder ever,"Don't buy this grinder, it's absolutely useless and has an incredibly weak motor. Dropping one little bit of chicken in the grinder made it wail and weep, and the chicken was mushed about, not ground, and clogged up the housing. After a few tries, I wised up and realized that this was going to be the result each time. It doesn't actually grind meat, so I'm a bit mystified as to why it's called a ""meat grinder."" Save your money, save your time, buy something else, unless you enjoy taking returns to the post office."
4,Helpful overview,"Swavely provides a simple, readable manual outlining the so-called wisdom approach to biblically based decision making. He offers a popular presentation of Garry Friesen's well-known work, Decision Making and the Will of God. The book is helpful for those who desire a simplified version of the wisdom approach and was beneficial as a resource for teaching a series on the topic in an Adult Bible Fellowship in our church."
1,Run away and never look back!,"This is the worst piece of sotware I have ever worked with! I am a professional and dedicated user of Adobe products, but I'm at a loss to explain how one of the leaders in imaging and video software could produce such faulty software as Encore DVD. I don't know what this .5 update was supposed to fix over the original. This software is infested with bugs. Something that works one day, won't work the next. Or a project you created months ago, can't be updated later for no explainable reason. The advertised features are great, but they really are too good to be true. Surfing around on various forums I can see that I'm not alone in my complaints. I don't understand how Adobe can continue to keep this on the market."
4,This book is perfect for Yoga students and Teachers.,"I read this book as part of Teacher's Training course for Yoga. I found this book to be very informative. It gives you detailed instructions and Yoga positions that will help with different ailments and diseases. Also learning the bone structures and parts of the body was helpful, while studying Teachers Training for Yoga. I liked this book very much. I also thought Gary Kraftsow's writing was down to earth so that everyone can understand."
2,Kindle version has poor image quality,"I lost a copy of this book when I lent it out to a colleague, so I thought it would be nice to have a digital copy since I use the Kindle App on my PC and IPad but after purchasing and downloading it I quickly discovered that the image quality is terrible. If you are thinking of getting this in a digital format, don't waste your time or money. I hate to give 2 stars but I have not other recourse, so my recommendation is that the publisher and or author that may not like my review should contact Amazon and get a new digital copy created and provide any consumer that already purchased it with a free update."
3,"Too much info for a ""newby""",There needs to be an intro ro Yoga for Wellness. This is a case of too much information for someone just getting started
4,Easy to understand,"The illustrations and explanations are clear and easy to understand. Better, the exercises seem to be working well and as promised."
2,"Yoga Practice from NY,NY","I was disappointed by this book. Not only did it not live up to its many reviews, but the models often do not show the posture in a 'professional' manner that should be exibited by a teacher. The result of this is a wrong impression of what the user should be doing with their shoulders / back / stomach during the various asnas.In my view a far better book is Yoga Mind, Body and Spirit by D Farhi"
1,"If you can't trust the writer, don't buy the book","I bought this book when it first came out in 1999. Soon afterwards, I attended an expensive, 3-hour ""workshop"" taught by Mr. Kraftsow in Boston. I was quite excited to attend the workshop, as I was interested in learning more about his yoga practice, but found the book too poorly written to translate into practice.Problem was, Mr. Kraftsow treated his workshop as just another book promotion opportunity and talked about himself and his book for more than 2.5 hours, leaving less than a half hour for actual yoga practice. Even worse, he insulted people from different geographic areas and suggested that many yoga practitioners were miserable because they didn't eat enough sugar!When I got home from his workshop, I threw his book away. If an author is that untrustworthy, I don't want to follow his yoga either."
3,Where is Volume 6 Already??,I'm wondering what happened to Volume 6? I sure hope Wee Willie Winkie is in it.
2,Set of 3 DVDs not all good,"If you are like me and want to purchase this DVD set, so your kids will be able to watch movies with no violence.Then only 1 of this DVDs (Black Bird) on this set will truly achieve that.Even though the other 2 movies are good, they do not catch the attention of today's kids (even when you sit with them to watch it together)So, if I have to do it all over again, I would buy only the `Black Bird' DVD instead of buying this whole set"
1,Picture?,Is the item pictured an IRC Redstorm? Is the item pictured an IRC Redstorm? Is the item pictured an IRC Redstorm? Is the item pictured an IRC Redstorm? Is the item pictured an IRC Redstorm?
5,Yea!,My student loved it! He is a huge Mario fan and get to watch as a reward in my Special Education class.
3,repetitive,i bought my husband a few book from the author...and this one just seemed to be more repetitive and have more medical terminological.
4,very helpfull,exactly what I expected and fast delivery. this is a great book for those of you who have back pain. Try it it works!
5,Changed my life,"Hard to accept at first, but the concepts in this book changed my life. Went from 10 years of diability to complete recovery."
5,Great book if you have an open mind,I had severe neck pain that traveled all of the way down my arm. MRI showed bulging disc. Two spinal injections offered little relief. I read this book and I am pain free. Figured it was worth $12 to give it a shot.
5,Everyone should read this book,"If you have doubts that a book can help you, try this one. I didn't think a book could change my life, but this one did, and I'll always be grateful."
3,For health professionals,"I got more out of J. Sarno's other books: Healing Back Pain and the Mindbody Prescription. The Divided Mind seems to be aimed at health professionals. It's an interesting read but if you've read his other books, you won't learn all that much."
5,Comprehensive & compelling,"Having suffered pain from a 'slipped disc' in my neck which all but disappeared after reading the Mindbody Prescription, I was keen to read Dr. Sarno's new book. Effectively a polished & updated version of his theory & treatment, it also contains very useful chapters by other MDs working in this field - just having a slightly different perspective & new wording was extremely helpful. I'd highly recommend it to anyone with a therapeutic background - it seems slightly more pitched at this audience - but also to anyone still working on any TMS based pain."
5,Fantastic Book,"I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH A BACK PROBLEM FOR 20 YEARS, I HAVE BEEN SEEING A CHIROPRACTOR FOR MANY YEARS. THIS BOOK IS PHENOMONAL, IT LITERASLLY HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. ANYONE WITH A BACK PROBLEM OR CHRONIC PAIN SHOULD GIVE THIS BOOK A TRY. I READ DR. SARNO'S BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE YEAR AGO, SINCE THEN I HAVE READ HIS TWO OTHER BOOKS. HE IS INCREDIBLE, I STILL FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE FOR BACK PAIN FOR ME IS A THING OF THE PAST!!"
2,Heard so many good reviews,"I heard so many good reviews of this book,but when i started to read through I noticed It seamed to jus ramble on...Takes 4 pages to sum up 1 paragraph..Had high hopes but was disappointed.."
2,The Divided Mind,This book cntained to much self accolades and too little real information.I did not finish it.
1,lives across the world,Too many markings and writing in the book.yellow highlights all over the book which advertised as a good book to purchase.
4,Accurate Depiction of Teen Struggles,"This was a great depiction of what it is like to be a teen and dealing with the desires for romantic relationships. I thought the flow was great and accurately depicted typical scenarios. However, I would like to see more propaganda for teens to not only abstain from sex but from the heavy kissing and petting that only deepens the threat of temptation to have sex. It saddens me the examples set for young people that heavy kissing which almost always involves petting is just part of dating. Where is the message of saving every part of your body? Overall this was a great book to interest a young person. I am a parent of a pre-teen and she will be reading this book as part of educating her on the dangers of stepping out of God's Plan for her and her body. Thanks Josh for being so active in this way."
1,should be called generally vague refernce book,"Being a novice in woodworking, i'm trying to familiarize myself, by reading books on this subject, and this book falls far short of my expectations, it tries to show or cover, too much in a very limited space, the content,lacks.. it seems incomplete, short in the explainations, and the photos are equally disappointing.. (buy a patrick speilman book instead)"
3,Flawed work,"As a film about Hitler's rise to power and pre WWII Berlin, this film is much the failure. There is a pervasive unease which permeates the air, but it's as much an existential angst aborted from the belly of commerce/captialism as anything else. Viewed as an expressionist nightmare where poverty, brutality, capitalism, depravity run the human spirit into the ground, the film is quite powerful. It takes a second viewing to appreciate Carradine's performance. Liv Ullman is very good, as you'd expect her to be in a Bergman film. Ultimately, the film suffers from an inability to focus as well as too much money being spent on the sets (which are nice btw)instead of the real issues at hand. I'd recommend this film to Bergman enthusists...others might ask ""what's the point?""."
4,A Clasic,"Hemmingwas was truly a gifted writer. His use of words makes my head spin, Great writer probably the best American writer."
3,Not a very good film but great starring cast,"Unfortunately, this is not the best vehicle to see the best talents of Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner and Errol Flynn. The story line revolves around the ""Lost Generation"" of young people during the post World War One era. In their middle forties at the time of filming, Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn are clearly too old for their parts. However, it's great to see both of these former matinee idols together on film; albeit just shortly before each of them died.Also, it loses something being viewed on a television set. I'm sure it was quite spectacular in CinemaScope in the theatre, especially the bullfighting scenes. I would recommend this film if you are a fan of the stars or a fan of bullfighting but not if you are a fan of Ernest Hemingway."
2,Great Book - Below Average Movie,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I recorded the movie from HBO and watched it and immediately saw some huge issues. The first was the casting. Several of the actors were many years older than they were in the book. The main actor that played Jake was 40+. It simply didn't work. It's odd that they didn't use younger actors because they followed much of the storyline, and even the dialog, closely.If you are a fan of the book you may want to watch this movie, but don't go out of your way. I still think this is a great story and would like to see someone make a new movie from this book."
3,Bulls of Pamplona vs. Errol Flynn,"Need I say more? Don't miss Flynn and Eddie Albert actually running through the streets and into the bull ring with the dudes of ""Pamplona"" (filmed in Mexico) Two guys get gored! Ava G. is as sensual as ever, whether in a Parisian bistro or flirting with a matador. Location is a huge part of the novel, and this movie gets is right.The movie falls far short of the reckless desperation of the novel, and Tyronne P. is a soul-less Jake, but that would be a tough role for anyone to play."
3,Not as described,"Wasnt what the title said, it was a k&N cone, but it wasn't the extreme. Didn't have filter on the top of the cone. Was very disappointed"
3,Over sold,"I saw all the previews for this movie and the trailer, and thought is was going to be very funny. I was very wrong. I barely laughed and thought it was stupid. The trailer was very misleading and was better than the movie. What a waste of money and time."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","The movie was cute, brought up some valid points. But it was also whiny and unbelievable in some sections. Overall a decent movie. But Sarah Jessica Parker is just a little to old to be playing the part. Her age is showing and her co-stars that played her friend and husband were just enough younger looking than her so she came off as simply too old."
3,So-So,I am a superfan of Sex and the City so I gave SJP the benefit of the doubt on this movie. And I was disappointed. I was just okay. Not great and not terrible.
3,OK,"This movie is watchable. Has some great actors, but not their best work. The movie moves slowly and doesn't have much substance. At least SJP is so cute."
3,Not as funny as I thought,Not so much a comedy as it is realistic to how hard it is to be a mom and a working woman. Still a decent movie to watch and enjoy.
2,Not memorable,This is one of those movies if you have seen previews or trailers for it you have basically seen the movie and know what happens. It was not very good...Especially since I watched it rencently and can't even recall most of it. BORING
3,Light Comedy.,"Just what it looks and sounds like: a simply, light, comedy. Nothing special one way or the other and I, a man, could not sit throught it but wife enjoyed. She 65. So recommend if you want something completely light."
4,I Don't Know How She Does It,I actually enjoyed watching this movie. I love Sarah Jessica Parker and I like the fact that she chooses her husband and doesn't have an affair.
3,"Maybe predictable, but very funny, and cute.","I don't know why rotten tomatoes gave it such a bad rating, It wasn't horrible at all. I laughed way more than I thought I was going to.It reminded me very much ""He's Just Not That Into You""- with all the commentary scenes, but I thought that added to humor. Yes the ending may have been predictable, but despite news reports not all people are heartless. They will generally do the right thing. If your looking for a simple feel good comedy this is the one to relax and watch."
4,Loved it,"Fun, entertaining and hits the spot with a powerful message/commentary reflective of working women's lives. I can't say I've seen a SJP movie that I didn't like! It's not masterpiece theater or oscar garnering work, but I definitely got my money's worth and feel 100% satisfied."
1,"I don't know, either ...",no talent.No appeal.No looks.I'm at a loss as to how she does it.Every time I see this woman I'm baffled by the fact that I'm still seeing her.
4,Loved it!,"I loved this movie. SJP is always endearing, and she really portrayed with accuracy the struggles we go through trying to balance our family lives and our careers. The movie moved me at times and made me laugh as well. Very entertaining."
2,Yawn,"Chick flick without much real, original character development. I usually can suffer through these with my wife but the humor was off-mark and just not much beyond generic stereotypes."
2,Okay and mildly entertaining,"There is not too much else to say about the story, which concerns a woman who is almost too busy to attend to her husband and kids at all. That said, it does play into some stereotypes regarding working mothers. Will she ever learn to balance things? Does it matter? We have seen this before."
4,lovely,"Very sweet. And not as simple as some of the previous reviewers concluded. Highly recommended. SJP is wonderful, as are the other cast members."
2,Really pretty awful,"Didn't have very high expectations going in, but this was a pretty horrible film. No idea what the point was. Sad too, because it has a good cast.Wow, I really should write reviews for a living."
2,Not even a good 'bad' movie!,"I was rather disappointed with this film. I tend to like the actors, and had hoped their likability would at least make up fro a predictable story-line, alas it was not the case. The plot is tedious and the characters exhausting. Not recommended when you're looking for a fun chick-flick."
3,Good but not great,"I love Sarah Jessica Parker, but this movie is too predictable. How does she do it?... She doesn't. Big surprise! The acting is fair, but I wouldn't buy the movie, just a rental."
3,Slippery When Wet,Love the easy fill window. Love the power and grind variation. All came to a halt when my oily/wet cooking hands couldn't grip and grind. Switching to the keytop model.
5,Amazing,"The only bad thing about this peppermill is that all others now seem inferior, and my friends think it's weird that I insist on bringing my own peppermill when I go over to their houses to cook with them."
1,Terrible,The peppermill arrived relatively fast but didn't work correctly out of the box. If I wasn't so busy I'd send this crappy product back.
2,Lack of longevity is an issue,"I also purchased this mill based on a review in Cook's Illustrated. It worked well for a couple of years, although I also experienced the design flaw with the filler opening that can easily open when you don't want it to. The disappointment came when the plastic cracked around the axle of the grinder mechanism, rendering the mill useless. It shouldn't be necessary to discard and replace a tool after only a couple of years of moderate use."
2,Not complete satisfy,"Pepper mess after using it, poor cover at the bottom, low capacity, and expensive. I still looking for the perfect peppermill. If someone knows it, tell me about it."
1,I retuned it,The pepper spilled all over when attempting to us it. I found another brand elsewhere on the Internet that works perfectly.
1,Rust on the metal parts after wash,"I bought this item after reading many of the positive reviews on Amazon and had high expectations as to build quality. Unfortunately, the Magnum turned rusty at a few spots after I washed it. Since I do not stay in the US, the international shipping for a return will cost me more than the amount of refund. So it seems that I am now out-of-pocket and without a peppermill."
5,Pepper mill,"I first saw this pepper mill offered on the King Arthur Flour website and I trust them. I was not disappointed. It grinds very well, easy to turn ( I have arthritis in my hands). I haven't change the grind setting because I like where it is. Filling the pepper mill is easy enough with a funnel or use a cup with a pour spout. I highly recommend this pepper mill."
4,"Great grinder, but...","This is really a great pepper grinder - we have 2 and my in-laws have the larger Magnum. Works great, love the simple grind adjustment. One big flaw is the piece that rotates to open/close the chamber holding peppercorns does not stay closed well so you need to really look before using - make sure you only rotate clockwise otherwise there will be a spill."
5,Amazing!,"Servers in restaurants give up and leave the pepper grinder for my husband to finish putting pepper on his salad or soup. Consequently, we've normally gone through a pepper mill (and about eight ounces of peppercorns) every six months or so. He loves his Unicorn brand Pepper mill. We have the small and large sizes, they both grind very wel, have not jammed once and have lasted a year now. I'm so happy to have found something that supports his pepper ""habit"" which is what keeps him off salt! Thank you for a great product."
2,Great...for a while,"I purchased this pepper mill based on all the rave reviews just about everywhere, especially Cook's Illustrated. It was great for a time, but now the grind adjustment screw will not stay where I've set it. The thing loosens after one turn, meaning that when I season while cooking, I end up with some finely ground pepper and a lot of cracked pepper. Okay for a steak, but not fried eggs! It's a pain to stop after every turn and retighten the screw. I emailed the manufacturer about the issue and got no response at all. If you want a good mill that you will need to replace after a year or so, this is it. Mine is going in the trash."
4,Very good pepper mill,I've used this pepper mill about 4+ years. Loading new peppercorns is easy with the large opening (make a quick paper cone to serve as a funnel so you can load faster without losing a single peppercorn). The capacity is perfect for my use and it produces a lot of ground pepper fast (compared to my old no-name mill that took several minutes just to get a measly teaspoon of ground pepper).I took out one star because the screw that adjusts the grind can't seem to hold its position on the finest grind for too long anymore.
5,Utility AND Aesthetics,"This pepper mill works better than any I've ever had. Unlike the old-fashioned wooden peppermills, you won't have to work so hard...a couple of twists and you're done and just the right grind-particle, too (not too corse, not too fine). I highly recommend this pepper mill."
3,It's just ok,"It grinds the pepper up nicely so no complaints there. My husband hates it because he is constantly turning the part where you refill it and pepper dumps out everywhere. It would also be nice if the crumb tray fit snugly so you could move them around together. It's just a tray, not a lid."
1,the send is bad,"is very late the service of send, no receiver the battery to time. the company send for second battery tks"
4,Back to the 80's power-pop,"If you harken back to the days of Joan Jett and Pat Benatar - this is the album for you. Fairly generic power pop music - with an updated ""feel"". I say that not as a negative, but as a positive - but you have to like POP music. The songs are strong, and the musicianship is top-notch. They are not reinventing the wheel, by any stretch, but they are rolling out a ""wheel"" you haven't heard in a while."
5,"It's not complicated, people. . .",". . .what you get here is, plain and simple, balls to the wall hard rock. If you want me to expand, I'd call it contemporary Joan Jett-type hard rock. And it's darn good. All of the songs are toe-tappingly good (especially ""Now is the Time""), and I have to give a special mention to the acoustic cover of Iron Maiden's ""Wasted Years."" Using acoustic guitar and some light keyboarding (or is that a real string instrument?), Noelle's vocals on top, this all adds up to create a new dimension to one of my favorite Iron Maiden songs. This album is a real winner, especially for the $9.98 price. Buy it and have some hard-rockin' fun."
5,Better Together: This album and an amplifier that goes to 11,"It's been 20 years since I've wanted to listen to an entire album over and over again for weeks on end. 10,000 tunes on my iPod and I keep coming back to it. This great rock and roll - tight instrumentals, awesome vocals, full sound, & tons of energy. I rate every tune 5 stars. Alas, the volume on an iPod goes up only so high. This CD needs to be played full blast on a good stereo with big speakers. A fine way to go deaf."
5,They're back. & better than ever.,"I have to admit I was a little worried about this record - I was a enormous fan of their major label debut ""From The Attic"", & when the guy that wrote those songs left the band it was definitely an ""Uh oh"" moment.Turns out I needn't have worried.Damone just recruited a new songwriter/lead guitarist ( Mike Woods, a longtime friend of Damone drummer Dustin Hengst ), kept going. And I'll be damned if I don't like this album even MORE than ""Attic"".If you've got a soft spot in your heart for the melodic rock 'n' roll of the 80's, you'll eat this album up with a spoon & ask for seconds ( then thirds, fourths, etc. ). It's absolutely cram-packed with monster riffs, hooks, & sing-along choruses. If you've ever thrown up the ""metal horns"" ( you know, \m/ ) in a non-ironic, non-hipster-doofus fashion, this is the album for you."
5,Mother&child,"I love this cd, but I have a problem with it?? I had one just like it and had it stolen.. So I wanted another one.. That is why I came here to see if you had it... but when I recieved it in the mail... The cd's are differnt.... The one I had has couple different songs.. If you could please help me find the excat one I would love you forever... but don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the one I got.... I like it but it is just missing the one song I really like...."
5,Friendly Felines,What a wonderful compilation of educational and heartwarming stories! I have four domestic housecats myself and have oftentimes wondered what similarities or differences they might share with their close cousins. NOW I KNOW! What strikes me the most throughout the material is the responsibilty displayed by the lucky folks who own or shall I say are owned by these wonderful cats. I find it compelling that such a special relationship can evolve from these wild cats. My domestics are only a cathair away from them evolutionary wise and it was refreshing to see the same feelings that I have for mine expressed through these admirable small exotic feline owners. Kudos and I truly hope to see more future material of this nature. Thanks for the valuable product!
1,why,"if you have enough time and interest in derivative punky/funk music to get this far down in the barrel, you'll probably think its okay...although that says something about your lack of taste.there is nothing whatsoever to distinguish this from a billion other releases in the same style that are produced every year, unless its the bad production. thus, there is no reason at all to bother.trust me, youve got better things to do with your time."
1,NOT GOOD,ORIGINAL CD BUT THE COVER WASN'T GOOD AND THE CASE BROKE DURING DELIVERY... PICES BROKE OFF
3,Experimental and enigmatic,"Okay, I've been a big fan of this woman's music up till now. On listening to ""BOWMBOI"", though, I'm not sure what to think. Even after several months of trying (I got an import copy), I can't say that I really like this CD, at least not yet. It has its moments, of course: the duet with Ousmane Sacko, for example, highlights that griot's searing voice, and the title cut has lots of energy.But overall, ""BOWMBOI"" lacks the kind of rootsy appeal that marked Traore's first 2 recordings. She experiments here with string quartets, odd percussion and mysterious sounds; there's very little to dance to on this CD. One can imagine her putting together the final mix in a darkened control room instead of a lively jam session.I'll keep listening to it, and perhaps one day a melody from it will stick out in my memory. Right now, it's mostly a dim sonic blur."
4,"""The Ring"" (2002) and ""The Ring Two"" (2005)","""The Ring"" is one of the best American Horror films ever made. Very creepy and involving. It plays out like a mystery where you as the viewer have to put the story together with different clues. It is shocking and wonderful. ""The Ring Two"" is a decent follow up. Not as great as ""The Ring"" but as far as sequels go it is a logical advancement of the story and gives a worthy conclusion. There are plenty of scares and mystery to go around with these two great films. Pick them up if you only own them on VHS and want them on DVD or if you are just looking for some good scares. Also look for great performence by Naomi Watts.""The Ring""- 9/10""The Ring Two""- 7/10"
5,Student Rating,"This book is so ""scientifically correct"" that it was used in my ecology of the tropical rainforest class that went down to do research in Costa Rica. It was so enjoyable though that I've read it through 3 times since my completion of the class. This book brings the best of the tropics to you."
4,A little bit about the rain forest,"This book gives a detailed depiction of a typical day in the rain forest. The book contains 17 chapters that are written in essay format and each chapter covers a different topic. This gives the reader the advantage of being able to pick up the book and just read for a short period of time, and then set the book down with out feeling as if they will completely forget everything before the next time they read the book. This book is filled with whimsical descriptions about the rain forest. I would say, if you are interested in learning about the inner workings of the rain forest, in a very lyrical way give ""Tropical Nature"" a try."
3,Not 100% Satisfied,"Great quality for the money but I am not happy with the color, too peachy. No packing slip enclosed, call to seller not returned hence the low rating. Service is key. I am keeping the item anyway but will use it for the guest room."
3,I didn't like the color,I bought this duvet set go to with a sheet set from the same maker in the same color but they did not match exactly. The color is a little more peach than the picture seems to indicate.
4,very soft,"Not quite the green I was looking for but for the price it's well worth it. It's very soft, comfortable, and washes nicely."
4,"Great price, good look","For the price, this is a great item! The fabric is a little thin and flimsy and I can sort of see the squares of my down comforter under it but it is very soft material and gives the room a great, warm feel for a cheap price!"
1,Icicle? I think not!!,"I couldn't wait for this to arrive. After waiting nearly two weeks(which is the longest I've ever waiting for an order from Amazon) it finally arrived. I got a shock when I opened the package and saw a mint green duvet set!!! I ordered Icicle. What would you think Icicle is? I was thinking a very light blue or even off shade of white, but mint green??? Terrible!!!"
5,Great price for all-cotton,"Great price for all-cotton. After the first wash, the fabric seemed to soften and feel as if it had more threads/square inch. The color ""icicle,"" apparently is really a light green----a very LIGHT green, so it goes well with my white sheets. It's hard to tell that the green is there. I do wash my sheets with a small amount of bleach, so maybe the color is fading more towards white."
4,Duvet Cover,"A little big for my full bed, but nice cover, I like the button opening, instead of a zippered opening.Didnt expect ""Icicle"" to be light green!"
3,Blast From The Past,Relive your childhood watching this DVD. But don't be mislead by the track length of 47 min. I can't believe Pioneer hasn't changed this to the correct length of 30 min yet. Far too short for a Concert DVD.Osfan
3,The Best of Musikladen - The Osmonds,"As a true Osmond fan, I was just a little disappointed in this DVD. Although, I found most parts enjoyable. The way the cover looks I was thinking more of like the concerts I use to attend. If you a are true die hard Osmond fan you will appreciate this DVD and it will bring back memories of the 1970's. If you are more of a Donny & Marie fan, this video is not for you."
4,A legendary bariton player,"This is a valuable record beyond price.It is Serge Chaloff in 1946 and 1950 who blew on a radio programs. The tape at that time remained, and it seemed to have been issued as CD for the first time in 1994.You hear the yell of audience who were excited by Boston jazz 1940's or 50's.It appears through about half a century. However the sound quality is not so bad, because it is the one that a professional engineer of radio station recorded.Serge Chaloff was a jazzman who blew a huge instrument of baritone saxophone. He was born 1923 in Boston, and dead there 1957."
3,Poor quality,"Serge is great, the sound quality, not so great. This is a live recording and the constant chatter of people in the background spoil what could have been a really great event.Blue Serge is a better recording."
4,If looks could kill,"Excellent book! I thought I would be put off by the book being set in the 90's, but I found myself enjoying slipping back to that time period! It was great having the protagonist of a Dreyer book NOT be in a medical profession this time! This certainly didn't seem like an early book by an author! NOW, a new Dreyer book, please!Becky Walters"
3,Remanufactured Panasonic,"It is not the best phone I ever had, but, it still works. Had it almost 3 years by now."
1,Don't make the same mistake that I did,"My contractor installed this to match the Grohe faucet next to it. It was fine until the stainless steel soap dispenser started to rust and then it didn't look quite the same.The biggest problems occur when you fill the dispenser. If you fill it more than about half-way, there is a significant probability that the weight of the dispenser will cause it to fall off the (poorly-designed) assembly. If it doesn't fall off and you continue to fill it, the soap/lotion can overflow from the bottle underneath the sink onto the insides of the cabinet. Then you have a real mess to clean up. I just can't imagine that a major manufacturer would not discover these problems before putting this item on the market.I would have given this product a '0' if that were possible. Since it is not, I gave it the lowest possible score.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
1,Faulty design!,"We've had our faucet for 4 years, and our bottle has overflowed or fallen off the silly little prongs at least 4 or 5 times.Some of these reviews have great suggestions for ways to overcome the bad design, but this is simply making up for a substandard product."
2,agree with poor design,"Like the others, this rusted & looked awful; the while plastic insert pumping mechanism also stopped working and would not dispense--and I bought two of these."
3,"12 Years Old, Starting to Fail","Unlike stated in the reviews below, the soap reservoir on my model is threaded and cannot fall off. However, I bought mine 12 years ago. The stainless steel will rust a little where the soap contacts it. The dispensers tend to get clogged when not in frequent use, such as over a vacation. I have two, and when the one on my main sink started leaking from the bottom of the pump head, I switched the pump head with the small sink that I don't use as much. However, now the ""replacement"" is also starting to fail. No matter how much soaking/cleaning I do in hot water, I still have these problems. I guess I've reached the end of life for this product. Too bad, since I don't really want to pay approximately $100 a pop to replace them. Three stars since a pump this expensive really should last a lifetime."
4,"Same as the others, but...","I inherited this soap dispenser when I bought my house in 2010. I have not had any problem with the reservoir falling off, but I did notice the soap leaking, then, eventually, it stopped pumping. Since Grohe's warranty only works for the original buyer, I was all set to buy a replacement pump, until I read one review here that said you could buy just the pump (the white movable part). I just ordered it. We'll see. Replacement appears to be simple. Pull out the existing pump with a pair of pliers, clean out the gunk, and push the new one in. The pump is sold here and elsewhere. Just do a search for ""grohe 45 260 800 Pump Only for Soap Dispensers""."
3,siphon problem,"The weep holes on the dispenser plug and then the liquid soap (in this case) siphons out. I took the entire thing apart, unplugged the weep holes with one of those narrow tooth bushes for getting between your teeth. and oh by the way I use those dandy little brushes for lots of things like cleaning the small holes in humming bird feeders. Then I added water to the resevior; so the liquid is not so viscous."
2,Poor Quality,I purchased this dispenser in black. The outer coating (which was black) peeled off and looks bad. I expected better quality from Grohe. Never again!!
1,definitely not worth the price,"Grohe is just an overpriced poorly designed brand, i have 6 bathrooms and 2 kitchens with Moens, Kohler, Delta and Grohe. All the Grohe fixtures deteriorated first (kitchen faucet, soap dispenser, shower head and volume control), their waranty is a joke(covers the ""original"" owner), their spare parts prices, if available, are outrageously expensive. Would strongly recommend any other brand but this..."
4,Curved shower curtains are a great investment!,"In buying my first house I found that my shower didn't have a rod or a curtain, so I couldn't wait to try out a curved shower rod. I had seen them many times before, there are many companies selling them now, and I thought they made so much sense.The only 2 down falls with this product (that I've found so far) are:1. The rod is a little loose in the fixtures that mount to the walls.2. The packaging could have been a little more substantial. Having said this, the product arrived in perfect condition.I've only bought this one curved rod so I can't compare it to others, but I'd recommend it, I've had no problems with it and it makes my shower feel much roomier than it really is.I'd highly recommend one of these to anyone whose shower uses a curtain! It was one of the cheapest and most fulfilling purchases I've made for my new house."
2,Disappointing; not sturdy like the original. Plastic mounting brackets? C'mon.,"I have an original Crescent Rod I bought at B,B & Beyond a few years back, which is sturdy and works great. This one, even though it came in a Moen package, is very light weight and has very lightweight, plastic mounting brackets, not the heavier-duty metal ones I got with my old one. I can't see this thing supporting a curtain and liner without problems, so I'm sending it back. Just too flimsy to have any confidence in."
3,Not As Described,"I had previously purchased a Crescent (brand) curved shower rod from another source, but they no longer carried them when I needed another one. I ordered this one as it is indicated as a ""Crescent"" shower rod. What was sent was an unbranded, curved shower rod, and of what appears to be of comparable quality, but it is not the same (mounting brackets are different). I did not want to go through the hassle of returning it and trying to find another source, so I have kept it. Just be aware that this is not the Crescent brand shower rod."
1,Junk,These carrying straps are too small. They are a pain to put on and take off of the metal bottles. Don't waste your money.
1,fell apart,This seemed like the perfect product for my needs. However after only a couple of weeks the glue on the straps fell apart. Seems like if it had been sewn together it would have lasted longer.
4,Is what it is,"Bought two slings to go with different brand stainless steel bottles purchased elsewhere. It is just a simple nylon strap/harness--could sew one myself if I felt like spending the time on it. Had a really hard time fitting one of the slings over the bottle, but it eventually went on. Shoulder strap is adjustable. It was nice for a simple short hike... not wanting to take hydration pack (and then clean out/disinfect hydration pack)."
3,Pay attention when you order,"Be careful. I ordered quickly based on the photo. This is only a sling, NOT A WATER BOTTLE. My own fault, but sucks anyway. Used the item in Yosemite. Works well, but don't expect to remove a bottle from the sling easily. Maybe the bottle I ended up with is too big, but once in the sling, it is in for good."
3,comments,I like the idea of the stainless steel but it it very difficult to drink from. Would like an air hole so you could drink more freely.
1,Bad Ad - Should state that bottle is NOT included.,"The photo and title implies that a bottle is included, when it is not. Nowhere do I see the statement ""bottle sold separately"". When the flimsy 50 cent strap arrived, I was confused and waited several weeks for the bottle to ship. Then I came back and read the reviews. Buyer Beware!"
1,"Too expensive for it, misleading ads.","The ads is kind of misleading, the price could include the water bottle. I have bought two nicer stainless water bottle from ROSS for $6.49.This company wants too much profit. They probably pay these shoulder sling for $0.50. I know that, because I was a wholeseller."
1,Sling only but the picture shows with bottle,This will be the first disappointed order with Amazon.com. Seller must show only sling for shoppers to avoid mistake. I will be more careful next time and order much less from Amazon for allowing this kinda seller with deceiving picture...
1,"It is just the sling, no bottle","If you read it a little too fast, the title and picture might seem to you it is the beautiful stainless steel bottle with a pretty black sling. No, it is just the sling, no bottle. Don't ask me wby I am writing this review."
1,Shoulder sling bottle carrier,"Very misleading!! When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting the bottle as well as the shoulder sling. Fortunately, I had a bottle to fit but it's very expensive for what you're getting. On the other hand, it you can't find an over-the-shoulder carrier, it will do the trick. If the product info had been more upfront, I would have been more satisfied."
4,Convenient,This water bottle shoulder sling is great for carrying a water bottle when walking. Smaller bottles than the 27 oz fit comfortably in the sling. This is so much better than cliping a bottle to my belt.
4,klean kanteen carrying straps,"This product was delivered promptly. Although it was initially difficult to insert the bottle in the strap holder, it definitely made it easier to carry over the shoulder while walking about."
2,It's ok,"This shoulder piece does do the job of holding the kanteen in something that you can carry over your shoulder, but it's such a tight fit getting the bottle into it that it's aggravating. If you're in a hurry to go, forget it -- you'll have to have time to fuss with getting it together."
1,Good Luck Trying to Get This on Your Water Bottle!!!,"I have a Klean Kanteen water bottle and could not get this sling on the bottle. The fabric holder has absolutely no give or flexibility, and no amount of effort was enough to get the water bottle into the sling. Maybe the sling they sent me was defective (it came unlabeled in a zip-top, sandwich-size bag). Returned for a refund. Love the idea of a sling, but... Don't waste your time or money until manufacturer improves this sling."
3,for klean kanteen only...,great idea for carrying your kk bottles. however the description should note that they are meant for kk bottles only. other bottles like camelbak will not fit. the sling is either way too small or to big for these bottles. the manufacturer should take note and market one for camelbak bottles.
5,Canteen Shoulder Sling,"The sling is useful if you don't have a pack, but gets in the way if you do have a pack. So if you're going on a really short hike without anything else or just a walk around town, this item is definitely a recommendation. If not, skip it and just stick it in a compartment of your backpack.Pros:LightweightStrong BuildSecure HoldCons:None"
4,Sling for Kanteen,"The bottles fit nicely in these, and the strap is long enough to put across my body. It works well for hiking, and it keeps your fingers from freezing off because the bottles so cold."
3,strap and bottle combo,the bottle strap fits really snug. Its adjustable and quite handy. I tried the bottle on my bicycle. but it was damaged (scratched) from getting it in and out of the bottle holder.
2,sholder sling only,"kinda dissapointed, the item was pictured with the water can and sling together it was just the sling. The sling it self is rather small not to many water bottles fit in it. If going to sell the sling seperatly it should adjustable to fit all sizes of water bottles."
1,Over priced strap,"This is a very simple strap that could not have cost more that $0.50 to produce.It weighs next to nothing. Yet the selling price is $7.50 and the shipping expenseis $7.00 - So the total comes to over $14.oo for a very inexpensive item.Furthermore, the listing/advertising comes across as if the water bottle is includedso your expectations are greater than what you actually receive - a small cloth strapwith no particular attributes.This is not a recommended item under any circumstances"
3,works fine but pin is fragile,The kids bathtub has a handheld shower that needs this mount. Kids have broken off the acrylic pin twice now. Glad I can find a replacement anyway.
4,If you've never heard any Concrete Blonde B-sides...,"This collection of B-sides and Live performances is some of Johnette and Jim's best work. It includes forgotten tracks like ""Free"" (the original title song of the album by that name) and ""Probably Will"" (one of their best b-sides, which is in the tradition of ""Caroline"" and ""Rain""). This is a most-have for any Concrete Blonde fan."
2,Duplication...........,This CD is another version of Bloodletting by Concrete Blonde. If you already own Bloodletting then there is no reason for you to purchase this CD.
5,Absolutely Fantastic and awesome musical masterpiece!,"It took me almost 4 years before I get this CD, until I found it in amazon.com marketplace. I did even asked my cousin from Maryland to buy this for me because they cannot ship this CD to me here in London, England. As I received it yesterday (02 September2002), I was so excited to listen to it and when I did, the songs and the lyrics moved me-it was so powerful plus the magnificent orchestrations!, I recalled this kind of rhythm when I went to the show ""Les Miserables"" here in London at the Palace Theatre. But of course, I cannot compare the two, though they're really great and two of the best musicals of our time.I really do hope that this musical should live on and once again to be performed in Broadway and here in West End. I am really glad to own a copy of this masterpiece."
4,where can you get it,I once owned this CD. I was at the show the night it opened and returned the next day to the Disney store adjacent to the New Amsterdam theatre and order a copy. They sent me a copy a few weeks later and I absolutely loved it. I was unfortunetly in a major car accident and this truly wonderful recording was destroyed. Does anyone know where you can get another copy.
3,How can I review an album they can't get?,"I ordered this CD from Amazon and now find out it is no longer available. So if you want it, look elsewhere."
3,Left Me Wanting More,"Despite the nostalgia that tapes like this inevitably provide (in good years or in bad), I would have preferred a more ""clinical"" approach to the 1999 Packers highlights. Instead of ""looking ahead"" to the Mike Sherman Era, I wanted to see more action from the actual '99 season. Yeah, I know the team only went 8-8, but each year has its memorable moments no matter how disappointing.For the next highlight reel, I hope the ""building for the future"" angle is canned in favor of a week-by-week synopsis of the preceding season."
1,Churchill watches too many westerns .,"Poor , poor pathetic Ward lives in a fantasy world where he is the ultimate victim . First , he claimed Indian ancestry so he could suffer like our Native American brothers and sisters .Turns out that was a lie .He had no Indian blood . Next he got busted and subsequently fired from his job for plagiarism but , in his arrogance refused to admit that he was at fault . ( A thief is more like it .)You can buy a lot of John Wayne movies for the price of this clown's book and get a better education in the process . Don't waste your time or money on this jerk . What he doesn't know would fill volumes . What he does know is next to nothing ."
1,Beware of hacks,"This work is poison for the minds of the statistically disadvantaged. It is a violation of the Theory of Variation and an embarrasment to the contributions of Dr. Shewhart and Dr. Deming. If the author had an understanding of the distinction between an enumerative and an analytical problem, and learned how to view the relationship between the voice of the process and the voice of the customer, he would refund everyone's money and apologize"
4,not too too bad,"I guess i liked the book because the technical writing was nice and easy to understand. I really haven't read this book, but i would like to know who this other ben cromwell is... especially since he lives in Gilbert. I live in scottsdale, and i'm intrigued that there is another ben cromwell in the world and so close to me. What's your middle name by the way? anyway, i just wanted to get that off my chest."
4,Right tools for right situation,"Most of techniques have been widely used in Motorola. This is a good book to learn Shainin Method which is practical and cost-effective for quality improvement. However, assistants of experts are highly recommended to conduct a real project because it does not explain the detail knowledge enough but mostly mention concepts. To compare and compensate Taguchi Method or classical DOE with Shainin Method this book would be very helpful as well as alternatives"
3,two messages that are blurred,"In principle the book is ok and reads very smoothly. The techniques are all right to in many situations In my view the problem is that Keki Bhote compairs things like Taguchi methods and SPC the wrong way, more politically than technicallyEach tool has it's value in specific situations. This counts for DOE (find the red-X) as well for SPC (process in control or not ?) as well for Taguchi methods (where is the optimum ?)Paying respects to the various inventors of tools and techniques in stead of trying to tear things down by a few examples should make the book more mature in my opinionIr. R. Onderdelinden O'linden Industrial Support BV"
1,World class quality?,"The book is a 500 pages long PR folder for Bothes consultancy. It tries to sell Shainin techniquies by comparing them to other techniques for problem solving, such as classical design of experiments and the Taguchi version. I guess that for a person not so familiar with those, Bothes & Bothes arguments may sound wise, which is unfortunate. No, try a good book on classical design of experiments instead, like, for instance Box, Hunter & Hunter's ""Statistics for experimenters""."
4,A Simple Guide to Make DOE Functioning,"While most of DOE looks like too Academay for most readers that without Statistical Background, it's true that this book is very simple for implementing DOE for reducing Variation and Optimizing the Process. It's certain that, this book is not providing a whole picture on DOE and the relationship/Linkage between DOE and SPC.I would recommend my friends who working in Quality or Manufacturing to buy one."
2,"Good info, but some ""just plain wrong"" parts","Refer to Dr. Wheeler's book ""Understanding Industrial Experimentation"" for a detailed critique of some of Bhote's methods. Caveat emptor"
2,There are better.....,"I was somewhat confused when reading this book couple years ago to learn about Dorian Shainin approach. Fortunately, subsequent to reading this book, I read the following two much better books on Shainin's ideas:Mnufacutring Solutions for Consistent Quality and Reliability by Robert Traver, 1995, amacomStatistical Engineering by Stefan Steiner and Jock MacKay, 2005, ASQ Press"
2,"Good practical approach, but the book is filled with typos","The Shainan approach is quite practical for industrial use. As many other reviewers have written, the constant slamming of other approaches detracts from the book quality. In the final analysis, the book overlooks that aliaising that will still occur, unless there are 4 or fewer factors, even after the screening methodologies have been used. But they should be small if the screening has really identified the various shades of X'sThe major problem with the book is that it is riddled with typos. Some of the typos are worse than in the previous addition. Consequently, one has to read with great care and check every number! Quite frustrating when using it to teach the Shainan approach!"
5,Practical,"The book explains excellent problem techniques in a very lucid manner. A must read for any process engineers, Six Sigma belts and any one in production/operation.Some of the tools the author explains (like Multivary analysis) can be extended into a statistical study (ANOVA) and more detailed results can be obtained. I wish the author does some of it in any forth coming edition atleast as an appendix (if not in main text, to keep its simplicity)."
4,Not for those lacking in vocabulary,"A thorough, yet occasionally vague study of postmodernism. Jameson's flowery, somewhat esoteric writing style should be wrestled with care, as your journey through this book will most likely be met with more dead ends and re-readings than an actual elucidation of the topic, as the words ""Yeah, okay...but what does that mean?"" will probably pop into your head from time to time. Of course, the author is a distunguished critic and writer, and the book reflects that. However, if your aim is to get a brief review or critique on what postmodern is, search elsewhere."
3,Jameson's modernist postmodernism,"Jameson is often able to provide readings of postmodern texts more insightful than those of self-proclaimed postmodernists, and this book is well worth reading for that alone. But his Marxist/historical method is inadequate when he discusses postmodern theory and it forces him to distort and reduce the theory into his own modernist discourse."
1,My Voice is a waste of money...,"I purchased My Voice software thinking, ""They have finally made this technology available at an affordable price"". Not so, there are two things you should know about about this product. One, it is very easy to use, you just click on the play button for a song and click on the voice extracter icon (the hand with the microphone). Two, when you click on the hand with the microphone, all you get is your song (voice and all) with the sound turned way down and slightly muffled. The bottom line is, this product does not work. I was extremly disappointed, however, since I did not pay that much for the item I was not livid! I gave it one star, instead of zero, because the product will play your CDs and it will find the names of the songs on your CDs."
2,Not worth the small price,"This came with a microphone which fell apart in the box. Bad start. But I suppose you get what you pay for. The interface is clumsy and the sound quality was poor. It does have a couple of nice tools built in, like a tempo varying slider which is very handy and studio effects like echo and reverb. But you might be better off spending more money for a sound studio program."
3,Has limitations - but not a bad thing to have,"MyVoice is pretty good at fading the voice part out on about half the songs I have tried - does particularly good with numbers like ""Hero"" by Enrique Iglesias and ""Masterpiece"" by Atlantic Starr. But i wasn't expecting it to work across the board. Users should note that some of the functions (such as playback of ripped tracks or MP3s) doesn't work under the newer version of Windows (not even talking about Windows 7), and appears to need a ""DirectX upgrade"", which still doesn't help. Anyhow, my older PCs can handle it, but the ripped versions of tracks with voice faded out are far worse than the real time output from a CD - perhaps I need to play with it some more. Overall, a fun complement to a full karaoke system - but still pretty much a toy and not a serious tool. Haven't tried the mixer part though."
1,Sounded too good to be true...,"And it was. Once installed, everytime I would try something I would get an error window that told me to reinstall DirectX. I have done this twice as well as uninstalling the entire program and reinstalling. There are even typos and blantant grammatical errors in the pop-up error boxes. I am returning this cheap and ineffective product and would recommend that if you are considering purchasing it, don't. What a waste of 27 bucks."
1,I DO NOT EVER WRITE REVIEWS BUT THIS PRODUCT SUCKS SO BAD I HAVE TO,"I have never written a review on amazon eventhough i have shopped on here for 5+ years. This is the worst software ever, it doesnt remove vocals it just distorts them with this ear-piercing sound. Can not believe this product is on Amazon. Plain and simple, it just does not deliver. If you buy this you are a retard."
2,exchange one allergy for another,"It's not Pledges fault that I'm allergic to the fragrance in their Dust & Allergen furniture polish. At the same time, if people are buying a product to try to reduce allergens in the environment, then perhaps that product shouldn't include heavy fragrance."
4,An Excellent Book On Ancient Canaanites!,"This book isn't thee book, but it's a pretty good one to learn something about ancient Asiatic life. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Not bad, Not great","This is a short book on Early Israels neighbors (cousins?) and it is readable, but too short to give you all the information you want. It is a overview that will help you understand the history of Ancient Israel. There are probably better books out there on the Caananites. I would suggest Egypt, Caanan, and Israel in Ancient Times by Redford as a better choice. That book is not specifically about the Caananites and their culture, but it gives you a much better idea about how Caanan fits into Near Eastern History in the period of about 1500 BCE to 600 BCE."
3,Good Book for begginers.,It's a good book for begginers and also for professionals too.But recommended more for begginers. It has helpfull general information about exercise and showing the right position of body during exercising but there are more ways of showing the right way of doing the exercises.
1,Just ok,"I expected this book to diplay all types of workout routines, but it didn't. Good for technique of some exercises, but definetly not good about showing all exercise routines."
2,Content excellent/ quality of paperback very poor.,The MLA Style Sheet is a classic document for any writer. The copy sent me looks as though it was taken from a garbage can. I was VERY disappointed but it was utilitarian.
5,This book is amazing!,This book has been very helpful to me in understanding the role my faith has in getting to and maintaining a healthy weight! Itinspires me daily!
3,Good Book,"Just what I needed , TY from a Person who tried to fill the void ..and one day realized needed Jesus not Sugar or Sweets"
5,Craving God,"I'm loving this book! It is really helping me to change the way I think about food, and drawing me into a deeper relationship with God. If you are tired of struggling with guilt and shame over weight and food issues, this is the book you've been looking for! Highly recommended!!"
2,Easy Read,I haven't really gotten that far in the book yet but it seems to be thought provoking. Looking forward to finishing it!
3,Not wonderful,It had good one liners but I was not impressed. It did not help me at all. I was actually disappointed.
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"...but I don't. Like many women, I struggle with food and body image issues, and I had hoped that a Christ-centered approach would help. However, I could not tolerate the author's intentional misapplication of Scripture and her overuse of the term ""Jesus Girl."" I guess I care too much about Scripture to see it misused in the name of dieting."
4,Great tool to get back on track,"Just got this book a few weeks ago and am halfway through. It is a very easy read, and granted, Lysa's writing style is a bit cheesy at times, but I realize this book is written in more of a ""conversational"" tone, so I try to take that with a grain of salt. However, the content hits true to home. I had a conversation with a friend the other day and realized she dealt with food being her idol as well and I told her about this book and ordered her a copy also so we can share and discuss. The chapter reflection questions seem simple and cheesy as well, but I believe it has helped as a starter to get me writing and thinking about my choices and actions when it comes to food, which really solidifies the material. I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because I like a bit more clever writing style that is new and fresh (less cliches and cheesy references), but if you look past that, the content is still very honest and helpful."
5,A God Send,A timely wake-up call. A new perspective on eating and exercise as a spiritual journey and not just a physical one. Definitely worth the read.
5,Making Healthy Choices,"One of the greatest way to make the right choices in life, good choices. And putting food or anything that takes your mind off God and His wellbeing for our lives is wrong. God knows whats best for us. This book is being used in a bible study with a group of women from our church, and we are having great results, lives are getting closer to God and women are losing weight. That's the whole idea of studing this book. I recomend this book to any ladies who are stuggling with making unhealthy choices in food or anything that has consummed thier lives, read this book and trust God through it all. God bless."
3,Crave,"I like the authors concept for this book but it does not engage the reader very well.While what motivates one can motivate others, I found that although interesting, it did not motivate me."
5,love love love,"cannot say enough good things about this book. bought one for all my close girlfriends. lost 112 pounds after reading and dedicating things to the Lord instead of just trying a new diet. even got my hubby to read. have my copy dog eared, highlighted, and so on. wonderful way to look at food differently. hope it works well for others."
5,Getting closer to God while dieting.,The gist of this book is that we can turn our cravings for unhealthy foods into a closer walk with God. The author offers practical tips to help turn your mind to the Lord when you are struggling with your weight. (The tips could be applied to any addiction you are trying to shake.)I love this book!
5,made to crave,"This is a wonderful book!! i highly recommend it to anyone who wants a closer walk with our Lord and Savior Jesus! It helps you connect what you are filling yourself with, instead of letting God fill you! I have bought several copy to pass out to friends.It's about one choice at a time."
2,Nice flow,It was not what I expected. Perhaps I was looking for more of a devotional type book with more scripture references.
3,Made to Crave,Lysa Terkeurst gives us a new view of what a healthy relationship with food is. Throughout the book she teaches how craving food can be replaced with craving God.This book is not a diet book. It is about finding peace with yourself and your eating habits. Each chapter is a Bible study/devotional which takes you through a different aspect of the struggles we have with food. At the end of each chapter are questions for you to ask yourself to help you apply the lesson to your life.As I read this book I agreed with the concept of replacing cravings for food with cravings for God and His word. There were many topics that I hadn't even thought about covered in this book. I enjoyed the personal reflections questions at the end of each chapter. They helped me to make the topic of each chapter more personal.I received a free copy of this book and have expressed my own opinion in this review.
3,Changed my focus from Food to GOD,While there are some interesting parts it seemed more like extended blog entries. The scripture listing at the end was the most worthwhile section for me. The idea of craving God more than food makes sense.
4,It makes you think,"this is a great book and very insightful. Lysa opens up your mind to realize that what you are craving is a relationsgip with the Father. Many of us who are not taking the time to search ourselves,or was never taught to have tried mant different things to fill this void. Some use food,some over work themselves, some use drugs, never questioning why we still feel empty? Lysa answere that for you and raises questions to make one search themself and therefor begin a road to recovery. Once you expose the root, you better understand what you need to kill the tree. Overeating\gluttony has been exposed and the enemy can no longer hide in the dark. Our relationship with our Father will satisft all our desire's and needs. Lysa brings that to the light in this book."
5,What an amazing study!,"Lysa has done it again! This book has helped both my sister-in-law and me SO MUCH! As women who have struggled with ""food issues"" for years, we are delighted to finally find a way to become ""more than conquerors.""Praise God for this wonderful book and the honest, straightforward voice of the author!"
5,Wonderful take on a healthy lifestyle,"I have never given God a chance to be center stage of my weight loss journeys...hopefully this time around with Lysa's encouragement and insight will be different. Its so refreshing to read from a Christian perspective on how God deeply cares about all our struggles, even food. I am thrilled to be reading this book."
5,Awesome!!!!,This book is a must read. I have gleaned so much that will help me as I start a Bible Study for women. It is for anyone that wants to draw closer to God.
5,Very Insightful!,Gives a very good account of how to totally view your consumption of food in a new and different way!
3,Really torn on this book,"Overall I liked it. I get what the author is trying to convey and agree that food should not be what I turn to instead of God. I get it. However, I really struggle with a food addiction. If it were so easy to just shut that off and refuse all the yummy food placed before me I'd do it in a heartbeat. I have prayed for help. I have cried out to God for mercy. I have a strong relationship with God, yet I still struggle greatly in this area of my life.I get the point of the book, but I don't agree with the methods. It didn't work for me."
4,Makes good sense,"Not a diet book, but a chance to explore the root of the problem when it comes to losing weight. This book teaches one to draw on the Holy Spirit for guidance, as well as an accountability partner, when attempting to lose weight."
5,"Awesome, we are meant to CRAVE GOD, not food!","Wonderful, CRAVE God, not give in daily, moment by moment to your dumb food cravings. Crave the ""things of God"", and HE will satisfy your physical hunger. Surprise! You will love this book!!"
5,An Audio Review,"I purchased the audio book. It was an awesome listen. Lysa takes this book in a little different direction than a lot of spiritual 'diet' books go. And she does a great job. She's very open and real, and it was comforting and encouraging to hear how someone else had dealt with the same eating issues I have. Plus, she's got a great sense of humor! The only thing about the audio book is that it's not read by the author, and it's telling in some places, where the reader doesn't get the 'cadence' of some of Lysa's quips. For the most part, though, it was fine. I'll *read* it again and again!"
5,The inspirational key I needed,"This book unlocked a new perspective on the weight/food issue for me. It was incredibly inspirational and taught me tools that I can use everyday in my struggles with weight, being in shape, and eating well. I am confident that I have made changes that will last me a lifetime."
5,Great Inspiration,This is not your average weight loss book. No fad diets or secret recipes hiding here. Inside just down to earth advise on how to grab onto God instead of a doughnut. Lysa TerKeurst really makes you think about what's important by sharing her story. I highly recommend this book.
1,Pass on this,"The author has put out the word to her supporters to write positive reviews here and on CNN, so don't be unduly influenced by the skewed positive reviews. This book is a crass attempt to make money from women who will grasp at anything to lose weight or for those that need to fill time in their January Women's Bible study groups."
2,They aren't 8.5GB,"So far the DVD's work fine, the picture quality is good.Not happy trying to put 8.40GB of data onto the DVD and being told there wasn't enough room. It claims that the can fit 8.5 GB of data. They all are 7.9 GB- half a GB is a big deal, I purposely bought these so I could have 8.5GB of data.But other than that- it shipped fine and I love Amazon! More upset with Verbatim."
5,Verbatim - Best out there,"I have had excellent success when copying on these dual-layer discs from Verbatim. I trust this product, and because time is money (I'm a professional videographer), if the longer-dupe process is delayed due to a ""rejected/error in disk"" when making copies, I'm that much more stressed. That has not happened with these disks in my years of using them."
3,2.4x - 6x - Watch It!,"This is just my experience with this one batch of 20!I had 3 that failed to burn. The remaining 17 burned withouta problem. However, after having just burned 100 of anotherbatch with ZERO failures AND really was rated at 8x, these 20took 18 minutes for each burn where-as the 8x only took 10minutes per burn. So when you buy, do pay attention to the""X"" factor."
1,4 out of 5 disks fail,"I spent hours encoding home movies and trying to burn them on these DVDs. They burn without a problem, but DVD players refuse to play them. I only had 1 successful DVD created so far, and 4 that didn't play. Just to make sure, I burned a Memorex DVD right after one of the disks failed, and it worked perfectly. The same movie, same DVD burner, same DVD player. I'm not going to take another chance with Verbatim 8GB DVD+R DL."
4,I still live for HEATHCLIFF!,I grew up watching HEATHCLIFF after school everyday in the 80's...The theme song itself brings me joy! I wanted to cry wishing I was a kid again (Smile)I bought this DVD not just for myself but for my kids to learn a little more about the cartoons I watched as a kid. Needless to say all three of my kids love the DVD so much even the tune is so catchy that I overheard my 6 year old humming to the theme song while brushing his teeth before bed...lol.I recommend this DVD to every parent that have small children in their home. They will love HEATHCLIFF and most of all the theme song.I just wish the DVD was subtitled or closed captioned for the hearing Impaired since I lost my hearing at 12 years old. I still do remember a little bit of the song though. (Smile)
5,Una inmejorable despedida,"Este disco de los Heroes del Silencio, el ultimo de estudio antes de su desaparición, es lo mejor que han hecho en su carrera, todos los demas discos, si tenian sus buenas canciones, pero en la mayoria habian 4 o 5 buenas, excelentes, y las demas se dejaban escuchar pero no eran lo mismo. En ""Avalancha"", no hay nada que puedas decir que sea malo, todo es impresionante e imprescindible para todos los seguidores de la banda, desde canciones como ""Deshacer el mundo"", ""Iberia sumergida"", ""Avalancha"", ""Parasiempre"", ""Dias de borrasca (vispera de resplandores)"", etc. Si estas indeciso en hacerte con el, no tardes mas y hazlo, no creo que te arrepientas."
4,Superb Album!!,"This one was the first disc of HdS i ever heard and its was magical!! it was 95' so with the pas of the years it got lost. i found it here i wanted to have it for my collection. it wasn't new, but just the case have a little scratches, it sound wonderful. If you like Heroes, need to have it!"
1,Worked good ..... for 6 months,"This reciver sounded great. JVC promotes the fact this receiver has a USB port, they don't tell you that you need to unplug it everytime you switch to another mode (FM...), because the connection stops working. Despite that I like the way it sounded, but I wish I hadn't bought this disposable receiver."
1,Glad there is a 2-year warranty on this model...,"Becasue I expect to use it. Like the other users here, I had the same experience. Works great, but then there is a short spate of erratic behavior and then total failure.I bought one, returned it after a fortnight. The second one a few months and then it, too, failed. It took weeks for a local service center to obtain the necessary parts. And when they finally got them, the unit failed almost immediately.I finally shipped it off to the factory service center but the cost of shipping alone would discourage anyone.The sad thing is that when it worked it worked great. I enjoyed it. And I had great use for many years of another JVC receiver. I only hope that JVC does right by their warranty with this sad product."
1,Total waste of money.,"My 2nd one of these in 1 year fried itself again. I got it as a gift, and have no receipt. JVC will not honor the warranty because ""I probably stole it and messed it up, and now want it fixed"". Avoid this and JVC."
3,Be careful of using the link from Amazon to Musician's Friend,I ordered 3 musical washboards from Musician's Friend through Amazon.com and they seem cheap and the sound seems not as good as actual Columbus Washboards. This seemed like the old trick of bait and switch... I called the Columbus Washboard company to inquire if they had changed their musical wash boards and was told they have not and further have not shipped any product to Musician's Friend for a few years so I am left to think that Musician's Friend web page showing all the Columbus Washboards is false advertising. I returned the three I ordered and ordered directly from the Columbus Washboard company.
2,A Big Disappointment,"I bought this because I thought it would be fun to hear a music based on JTTCOTE! Also, the only review on here said it was good and had been nominated for awards...what I didn't notice was that the WRITER had posted the review!!Don't get me wrong this isn't a total waste of money but it comes close!! For a start it's only 23 minutes long!! Secondly there are only 10 tracks and two of those are reprises!!I will admit that I like the sound of the title track, plus 'No Adventure in my life' and 'Woman of Science'...but unfortunately there is no orchestra just, what sounds like, a synthesizer!! All in all the lack of orchestra and short duration make this musical a disappointment and very unprofessional sounding!! Especially for the money!!!I bought this at the same time as Frankenstein The Musical which was only $6.99 - and worth every penny!!!!"
1,A farce,"I am utterly amazed at the ease with which the average person can be duped. Saw the film, read the transcripts (both of the trial and the appeal to the Pennsylvania supreme court) and am thankful that the judicial system is not as ignorant as the typical Wesley Cook supporter. We do not have a perfect judicial system and politics do play a role in that system. Frankly, there are dozens of better cases, for those opposed to this system, to take on in support of their position. The fact that Cook was unable to make a mockery of our imperfect system (not from a poor effort) is cause to celebrate. Kill that unworthy martyr and be done with it."
4,This was interesting new material for me in this case,I found it disturbing to the number of questions about the philadelphia da's office in the proof which would lead to a death penalty sentance
5,Have always known,"The only people who would disagree with this mans story..are those that are a part of the oppressive system of criminal justice..either in Philadelphia or elsewhere.As a current person who knows Mumia snd the entire story, it is easy to see the violations in this case..I can sense the racism and overall lack of fair play as it relates to wanting to keep a voice from being heard..When one is as articulate as Mumia Abu Jamal, it should be easy to understand how and why Pennsylvania, wants to kill himb and in essense to keep the entire world from speaking thier peace..That police officer was killed by his own..and Mumia will be free..that is why he is still alive. Get OVER IT"
1,Not accurate,"...I covered the Mumia trial. He did everything he could to sabotage his own defense. Mumia insisted again and again to a weary Judge Sabo that John Africa, founder of MOVE, represent him in the murder trial...even though John Africa was not a lawyer. A shooting that takes place in the wee hours of the morning in a shady center city neighborhood will NOT have very savory or perfect witnesses. This one did not. But if Mumia was defending his brother from Officer Daniel Faulkner, why didn't Mumia's brother testify on Mumia's behalf? Why was Faulkner shot in the head with Mumia's gun at point blank range? This documentary is a one sided mess. Mumia and Officer Faulkner deserve better."
3,Unconvinced,"As a die hard supporter of the West Memphis Three, Marty Tankleff, Ryan Matthews, Tim Matthews, and others, I'm generally very open to the idea that our criminal justice system erred and concerned about innocent convicted.While I'm still open to the idea and agree that more investigation should be done, but, the tape left me unconvinced that this is another such case. There's almost always ""some doubt"", but the question is whether it rises to the level of a ""reasonable doubt.""At least he's off death row.The tape itself was in perfect condition, arrived timely, etc."
1,Disgusting and inaccurate,"Reading this book to my daughter made me want to gag. Thankfully it was a library book. Also, the book says that Laura Ingalls Wilder at cricket pie. She ate BLACKBIRD pie, not cricket pie! (a much less disgusting choice in my book)"
1,Low quality: breaks,Warning: breaks easily.The scale is usable but the plastic ties that attach the buckets break very easily making it ... unusable. Because of the thickness of the ties they are very difficult to glue together as well. I'm trying to fix the problem but I may have to throw the scale away and get something else for my kids.
1,Poor Construction,I bought this as a visual for my counseling practice so it wasn't getting hard day in day out use. I was shocked when I came in one day to find that the thin plastic pan support had cracked and allowed the pan to fall. It wasn't a week later that the other side let go. There is no way to fix it. The item was less than a month old.How does this work in a classroom setting with children's rough handling?
4,A Family Novel with A Far Reach,"Shalev, in Esau, has created a beautiful, lush novel about the history of one family. He takes the narrative and jumbles it about, taking us back and forth in time, slowly unraveling the tale of the Levy clan. As we would expect from Shalev, there is an emphasis in this novel of the vicissitudes of love. Shalev is at his best when he is evolving theories of love, showing love in action, how it is born and how it dies. In the end, Esau is a novel that is a vast contemplation on love in its various forms. Shalev never exhausts this inexhaustible topic."
4,don't miss this israeli writer,"Shalev is one of the most original and exciting Israeli novelists, and not well known in the US. This book is fascinating as is Blue Mountain!"
4,A great product,"This comes with a lot of clothing for the dolls, and you can keep them all in the bag that they come in. They are nice and thick and sturdy. We've had it for two months now, and a few of the clothing items are starting to peel slightly, but I would definitely buy it again if I got a do-over. My 2 1/2 yr old will only play with them for a little bit, but when her older friends come over ( 3 1/2 yrs and 5 yrs) they play with it for hours."
2,"disappointing, compared to their latest album","I bought this on the strength of ""Good Dog, Bad Dog: The Home Recordings."" That was such a good album: unconventional, daring. Even the tracks I didn't like were different. This album is so conventional compared to that. Thumbs down."
4,Creative & Unique,i love over the rhine - their sound is incredible and lyrics are very cool. I wish their c.d.'s were easier to find.
2,I fell asleep,"I guess if you already know this guy and like his comedy, go for it.If not, I wouldn't recommend taking a chance. He just wasn't very funny.In all fairness - he could have become really really funny later on while I was snoring on the couch....."
2,Old school,"This is good but it is old school. Like watching a movie you saw 20 years ago, It is still good but you know that the technology and the delivery has improved so much since then that even the content (which is good) seems to be irrelevant."
5,Best of Doobie Brothers,This songs take me back to a much simpler time.It's refreshing! I remember my parents listening to this music and I still love it today.
2,Beware of Radio Edits,"Beware if you choose to purchase this set. I did without realizing that some of the songs are completely chopped up, namely 'Jesus Is Just Alright.' It sounds nothing like the album version. If the individual albums are remastered, I will burn my own version of the cd with unedited album cuts replacing the butchered songs here. Pretty pathetic and unforgivable when two discs are used to compile the set. The remastering is ok, but there is still not enough low end on the older songs. The Doobie Brothers are like Chicago. You get a recycled greatest hits package every year. Again, beware."
3,Radio Edits? You've got to be kidding!,"With a two CD set, there should be no radio edits. In fact, the CD doesn't say so on the back cover. It's only after you start playing the CDs, or load them into I-tunes, that you find out. What a rip off!There is simply no excuse for not including the full version of the songs listed. None!This mars what could have been a fantastic collection over two CDs."
2,THE VERY BEST OF THE DOOBIE BROS,I AM A FAN OF THE DOOBIE BROS THE SONG SELECTION IS GOOD BUT THE AUDIO IS VERY POOR THERE IS ALOT OF BREAKING UP AND CHOPING AND BREAKING UP.
5,The Doobies have never sounded so good!,Great remastered collection of the Doobie Brothers hits! This set has been a long time comin'! Definitely worth the wait
2,Edited Rhino's specialty,"2 stars only because Rhino used single version and not the original long version.Why do they do this?When I read a book I read all of it not just part of it, the same is true with a song."
4,this is the best Compilation on the Doobies,"finally Rhino Records got it right by bringing in a Double Set of the Doobie Brothers. the Liner Notes, the Sound&everything is very well done here. this Collection combines Album Favorite tracks with all the Doobie brothers Biggest Hits. this is a Must have for any Doobie Fan."
2,Musically repetitive,"Doobies had the 'hit' formula, which made them rich and famous thanks to music 'fans' short attention spans and radio marketing, but in total after all these years I'm finding their stuff formulaic and repetitive and predictable and pretty uninspired. Just my musical opinion."
1,Disappointed!,"I found this CD in a bargain bin at a local retailer, and purposefully chose the extended version in lieu of a more traditional ""best of "" version. The versions were nothing like what I grew up listening to, and it sounded like the 2012 middle-aged version of the Doobies, and not the young, fresh-voiced lads of long ago. I really didn't enjoy the CD at all, and will be passing it on to another fan in hopes that they will like it better than I did. The harmonies weren't crisp, their voices sounded old and tired, and I kept fast-forwarding through the songs hoping to find one that was like I remembered, or better due to being an extended version. Sad to say that didn't happen."
4,Not a collection for Doobie fanatics,"This is a fine collection of songs for those, like myself, who, while not big Doobie fans, and who, like myself do not want to buy all their CDs. Some reviewers complain that these songs are radio edits of longer material. But this goes unnoticed by those who know the Bros only from the radio and like what they heard blasting from their FMs while driving down the highways or walking the boardwalk on salty summer afternoons. I would think that those who complain would already own the individual CDs. The music included here is great, including songs I had forgotten over the years. If you are someone who enjoys this music but not enough to purchase pricey boxed sets or to buy each album (with I am sure some boring material - they weren't known for being an ""album"" group - that is to say you won't find any of their CDs on any critic's list of great albums). The sound is excellent as well."
3,Good but not Great,Good compilation of Doobie Bros hits. Too bad they did NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERBest of the Doobies.
3,only the very best,"This has all the hits. The ones that the radio has tried to play out, and the ones that many fans seem to love. Good classic rock."
3,Weetzie Bat Wannabe,"I thought Orpheus Obsession was a good idea for a story, but from the very beginning I was distracted by how much the author seems to try and immitate Francesca Lia Block. If you liked this book you'll definately love the Weetzie Bat series."
5,wait a day before...,"Listening to this cd, watch the film...enjoy it then when doing something like tidying your room, slap it on. You'll find-and i can guarentee this-that during a certain song reprisal, you'll stop and tears will come to your eyes and you'll wish you were a child again. That song is of course 'You Can Fly', it makes my cry, escpecially what happened to Bobby Driscoll."
4,...........,"This is a beautifully written book. In light of the current global situation, this book will be welcome to some. Yet Caputo's project has severe limitations. In terms of substance, 'theology of the event' amounts to deconstruction adorned with alot of god talk. Caputo, let alone Derrida, provides no way of talking about 'sin', that rather unpopular word that implicates us all in the problem of violence. Waxing poetic about the world and the powerless can amount to bad faith when one rejects a framework for thinking agency, and especially if one doesn't emphasize the contingency of violence. Given Derrida's Nietzschean insistence on the neccesity of violence, taken with Caputo's uncritical fidelity to Derrida, it is clear that Caputo creates unsolvable problems for his position, especially if it claims to be Christian.If you are interested in philosophy/theology of weakness, I would recommend Benjamin & Adorno, or Metz and Moltmann, over Caputo."
5,Lesson learned,I truly loved this book. I saw The Hiding Place movie as a teenager and was very curious about Corrie ten Boom. Very informative and well written. Strengthened my faith and taught me a lifetimes worth of lessons.
4,Uneven Pairing,Loved the Joan Wolf section but never could get into the second story...The story is typical Joan Wolf with a strong woman and children and animals. Nice light reading
2,Not worth it,Very thin and flimsy. Not worth it. Just buy a better thicker one to protect your phone.
4,Great Rock'a'billy lives again!,"This is a great compilation of some great RCA vintage Rock'A'Billy music. It was great to find Joe Clay which makes this cd worth buying. Especialy his version of ""Doggone it"" which is truly a lost gem! The rest is incidental background rock'n' roll. This compilation also has incredible liner notes. All comps should be done in this fashion. Only 4 stars and thats due to the other groups or individuals in this collection."
3,XX ???,"Gloves are good and would be great IF they were XX as advertised. Granted, I have meat hooks for hands and puffy with arthritis but other xx gloves have always fit.I had to struggle to get them on. Once on, they were very tight. I cant return tham because I had to cut the card connecting them together. I am hoping they will stretch some.In my view, they are at best, a small x glove.That said, they seem like they would be good, sturdy stiching reinforced where it is needed. I would recommen them for pople with ""large"" hands but not X or XX"
2,False appearance,"when i saw them on amazon when i typed ""leather gloves"" and this was on the search resultsi thought they were flexable and sturdy but after i got them i saw i bought a cheap Russian work gloveslets make it into cons and prosthe pros-it's sort of breathing gloves but not that much...-it Definitely protects the hands-they look coolthe cons-unflexable, cheap Material-looks less good then on the pictures-can't use a pen while wearing these-zero f****ng stretch, if you don't have a precise size you better of buying one size bigger then you needoverall this gloves are work gloves but a kitchen cleaning gloves has more flex then thispaying customers bewere of this cheap gloves (unless you're ok with cheap stuff)"
3,They are OK,I work for ups loading trucks. This gloves are nice and comfortable. However they are not good for loading boxes. The gloves started to wear off by the tenth day.
5,Awesome- great quality,These gloves are so great! I run a student-run business that provides shipping and storage services for students so I had to find a solid pair of gloves to use so that my hands wouldn't be covered in blisters! These are perfect for protecting your hands. Wearing them I still maintain essentially the same level of dexterity. I can even use my iPod Touch when i'm wearing these. The cushions on the outside are great for wiping off sweat. Overall a great pair of gloves that have now also replaced my workout gloves! Definitely worth the price.
4,Great Value,"I have used this glove on almost a daily basis for the last 2 months and they are among the best I have owned. The seams on the first and second fingers of this glove have not failed like most of my other gloves and the double layer of leather on the finger tips ensure it won't wear through.My hand is medium sized, but I have small fingers. I was hesitant to order gloves online because I insist on gloves with fingers that fit; I hate having space at a gloves finger tips. I crossed my fingers and ordered a small size; the fingers fit well but the palm is a little small. Although the glove felt a little small at first, the palm material stretches very well and the pair soon felt just fine. However, the a seam around the stretchy material in the palm is beginning to fail.These gloves are inexpensive, fit well, and hold up. I'm going to buy another pair."
2,Great Gloves but had a hole in them right out of the box?,"Nice gloves, great for short fingers, this is my second pair but this time they came with a hole in the side."
2,Inexpensive but shoddy quality.,Barely used them a couple of times briefly and I already noticed a couple of the seams becoming undone. They looked and felt nice when new but I don't know how long they'll hold up if I ever needed to use them for a prolonged period of time. Next time I'll purchase another brand.
3,"For long, summer jobs only","Contrary to the product description, these gloves are not ""easy-on, easy-off"". Removal always requires putting down anything you're holding. With other work gloves, I can remove one using an armpit and not involve the other hand. For someone like me who takes a lot of beer breaks, opening a can becomes a pain.As others have mentioned, these gloves breathe well. Too well for winter work, if you have dry hands like me. But I will probably use these in the summer.I have to admit, they do have a great feel."
4,keeps your palms from getting sore,"These gloves are very comfortable and worked really well with keeping my hands from getting sore. If you have used a drill for a long period of time and you get that soreness in the palm of your hand these gloves do a great job.The only negatives is the fact that you cannot wash the gloves in the machine, and the dexterity grabbing small things like screws and staples is crap.For general use though, fantastic."
1,cheap,fell apart on the first job my son had. They look heavy duty and high quality but they don't fit the bill. . If you need heavy duty gloves keep looking.
4,Well padded but easy to work with.,"They are well padded and comfortable. If one year from now they are still holding, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.My hands are usually better fit by large gloves, but the medium-size did the job here."
4,Good Working Gloves,"Great pair of working gloves, it has a nice comfortable fit and has a very good grip. Good for working with tools and if you do heavy lifting since it has a nice grip it won't slip..."
3,good but lacks keyhole thumb,The reality is I cannot find a work glove that is big enough. I thought these would suffice. If they had a separate thumb construction (keyhole thumb) they would be better. A good glove but I was hoping that 2xl would be bigger.
5,Excellent fit!,"These gloves are my go-to gloves. They fit my hands perfect and it is a joy to wear them. I find that they become transparent. I don't have to do anything special to use keys, access doors and just have tactile response.I have touched 500* stage bulbs with them. I have grabbed nails, used them with steel cabling. They put up with a lot of abuse and still look great, feel great and get the job done."
5,I love these gloves,"I bought these gloves in the spring of 2012, in anticipation of some carpentry and painting that I had to do. I've worn these gloves through the spring and summer, for a total of probably a couple of hundred hours. Here's the good:-They're comfortable: They feel like a set of calluses on my hands (in a good way.) They were never too warm in the summer, and they seem like they would retain a bit of warmth in the winter, though I don't know yet.-They're durable: I've dug holes, moved stone, sanded siding, hammered, and sawed with these on. Except for being appropriately dirty, they're unmarred. The velcro is still fresh, and the fingers are still pliable, even though I did a lot of messy painting with them.-They're inexpensive: I can't believe these gloves are under twenty bucks. What a bargain.Here's the bad:I can't think of any bad things to say about these gloves. They're great."
2,doesn't work for dirt,"This product really depends on what you plan to use it for. I used this product for an archaeology dig and it did not work for 8 hour days digging in the dirt, it was hard to grasp articfacts, and it did not prevent mosquitoes from eating my hands. It was very uncomfortable to hold a shovel and the dirt would go through the material so my hands were still covered with dirt by the end of the day. However if you are suing this for something less dirty and not involving mosquitoes it might be fine!"
5,Gloves,Boys on Christmas list loved the gloves....all raving about them and their flexibility. Would most surely recommend the gloves to anyone.
2,Not Small,"As a woman who does construction work I was excited to find a quality looking work glove in a small size. Unfortunately I will be returning them because ""small"" is still way too big for my small hands. I wouldn't be able to pick up nails, open my tape measure, etc. while wearing these because of the extra half inch on the end of every finger. If you have bigger hands this may work, but just realize the ""small"" isn't very small. (For reference, my pointer finger is 2 1/4 inches long and I can span 7 inches thumb to pinky. These gloves were about one size too big for me.)"
3,It was informative,The story its self was very good. It is just we were looking for the story on multiple personalities starring Heather Locklear. My husband liked the subject matter.
2,Hate these mixes...,The only good mixes that are just OK for me are the: Craig C. Mix and Chus & Ceballos Mix. Overall a very disappointing release. This is certainly not her best song...Tracks:1) ROCAsound Radio Edit (4:32)2) ROCAsound Mix (7:26)3) Chus & Ceballos Mix (9:50)4) Craig C. Mix (8:25)5) 'Baby Baby' - DJ Tool (0:37)6) Chris Joss Vocal Mix (5:42)7) Chris Joss Stripped Vocal Mix (4:46)8) Levon Vincent Mix (6:43)9) Good & Evil Mix (4:54)10) 'I Needed You' - DJ Tool (0:47)11) Heinrich Z. Mix (Ultimix Edit) (5:53)Not really a good buy.
4,( Great Remixes For A Classsic Hit ),"This remix cd is right up Jody's alley. She's not only mixing soul with electronica, but showing those other wannbe diva's that is good to take music to the next level. I enjoyed every remix on this cd and can't wait for her full length album to come out later this year. Jody has always been five steps ahead of the rest. Keep going girl!!!!Hajee."
5,good knife,Excellent knife with a nice wood finish. very sturdy and a great design. but most importantly made in the USA
3,"it is so small, like a toy","I thought it would be a watch with a large panel for men, actually, it has a small one suitable for young boys.a compact design, not used to the small panel."
1,Mens watch? I dont think so....,These watches are supposed to be made for men but theyre small enough for my kids to wear. They were not made for any man weighing over a hundred pounds. Absolute CRAP! This is the first bad review i have ever givin to any seller in all my years of using Amazon. Do not buy from this seller. Hope this is the only bad review i ever have to write. Good luck shoppers....
5,"price, quality, delivery 5 stars","I was buying many watches for my husband, all of them stopped working after a while.But this Casio's product is the best watch for the price and satisfaction. Would buy again with no doubt."
4,Simple and elegant,This watch is beautiful. It fits comfortably with its plastic band and is very low profile. My only complaint is that it was smaller than I thought it would be based on the photograph. I highly recommend this watch to those looking for a simple yet elegant (and affordable) watch.Here's a short video review I made:[...]
3,Really nice simple watch,"I was skeptical about ordering this watch because of the size, but upon receiving it, the size was just right. About the size of an sd card. After wearing it for a little over a month I've had the time jump up a few minutes twice. I've also gotten tons of compliments on it too. Though the major problem abour the watch now is that the band has become squeaky. I don't wear it loose and it's gotten annoying whenever i twist my wrist. Just started happening right after the return deadline. But otherwide its a nice watch, would buy one again."
5,Excellent $10 watch,Very good looking watch. It looks more expensive (can't tell that it only $10) then I paid. I had it for several months already and very satisfied. Still using the original battery.
5,Style and elegance,"I had a watch like this a couple of years back and it was my favourite watch, unfortunately I lost it, but I loved it so much that I just had to buy it again. I have to agree with the previous reviewer, this really IS ""the most refined, well designed watch on the face of the planet"", so elegant that you forget that it, after all, is a plastic watch, not a Rolex. So light that you wont notice it's there, and stylish enough to fit even the most expensive business attire. A classic for sure, and never mind that there aren't any numbers on the dial, or no date, or no alarm, or no backlight. I just love this watch, simply because it really is a statement of good taste, and no one will ever guess it coast you less than 10 dollars."
5,Love it!,"This watch is a simple, no-pomp, accurate time-piece. You can get fancier, but you can't get better."
4,Like it...,"Like it. Light weight, small and easy to use. Love it for light weight. You never notice any weight when you wear..."
4,Exactly what expected,This watch is simple and cheap. I bought it realizing it wasn't fancy or extremely durable and got exactly that. I am super happy with the watch and even happier with the price point. Don't expect high durability or functionality and you will happy.
5,Best Buy,"An easy to read classically simple face, including second hand. Can't beat Amazon's price. Casio's batteries tend to last several years. Only drawback is not very waterproof. Watchband can easily be cut shorter if too long for you."
5,As good as I had expected.,Appreciate quick shipment. Looks good. Keeps excellent time so far. Will be able to use without worries of being snatched.
3,SHORT watchband,"I'm a big fan of the watch itself, but it just barely fits around my (average-sized) wrist. The buckle is on the last hole of the strap, with barely enough strap left to slip into the ""keeper"". As a result, I'm wary of the buckle coming undone and the the watch falling off -- and the watch is so light, it's not as though I'd necessarily notice right when it fell off.That said, for the price and style it's tough to beat. I might look for a replacement band, but the watch was so inexpensive itself that I'm hesitant to double the cost (or more!) by getting a new band."
4,What you might expect.,"This product is exactly what I expected it to be. It's a simple watch with a simple face and a simple, plastic band. It has done a good job of keeping time and sits comfortably on my wrist. It has one issue which is commonplace with cheaper watches - The seconds hand doesn't precisely line up with the hash marks. Not a big deal, considering it's still easy to tell when 60-seconds have passed, but it is less-than-ideal. I got what I paid for, and I'm alright with that."
1,Not Even Good as Campy Entertainment,"Save your $1.99 for something at Taco Bell.This movie stinks right, left, up, down, and all around.I hate to think of how bad the sequel could be."
2,Poorly made item,Fast delivery of a poorly made item. Chinese made junk. The enclosed screw to mount pull is wrong for item. Threaded wrong? Would not fit. Too much hassle to send back.I had to drill out and mount with a different screw. Next time I will go to a hardware store or a specialty store.
3,Nice idea but look who is missing...,"...ok, so it says Country Blues -- but the title might suggest to some that these are the only roots of EC's work. It would be good to see a similar that included other major influencessuch as Howling Wolf, Muddy Waters, Freddie King, etc."
2,Bait and switch,"I live in a rural area without cell phone service and only use my cell on the road. Net 10 was a good deal when I bought it. It promised 1000 minutes and a year of service for $100. Now I can only get 180 days for $100. I never use all my minutes, but I need the days. I'll be switching when my days run out unless Net 10 goes back to its original promise."
3,Beware Net10 Web Site,"I've bought a few of these phones for relatives who live around the country but can't afford regular cell phone service. When they ran out of air time, I could get on the Net10 web site and purchase more time for them without sending them money. Now the website will take your money from your credit card, and when the time comes to ""add the air time to your phone,"" the web site goes to 404 not found. When you call customer service to complain, you learn that you cannot purchase air time for a phone unless you are in physical possession of the phone. This makes the Net10 phones a lot harder to use. Also, I have $100 stranded on a phone account which can't be used. Ridiculous. And yes, I have talked to supervisors. I'll have to buy an air time card and get the number to the phone user. Why have a web site! Oh, so they can spam your e-mail."
2,Beware of remaining time loss,"I have used NET10 for some time now. The service is good and for the most part the price at rate per minute is good.The potential user should be aware that he/she will lose any remaining airtime when additional airtime is activated.This isn't bad when the remaining airtime is 10 or 15 minutes , but 150 or more is not."
2,No evil? Surely that is a joke!,"I purchased the Net10 phone because of the one year of service available along with 1500 minutes. Before the 300 minutes delivered with the phone (which gave me 60 days of service) had been used I found that 1500 minutes was no longer available. Instead I would need to purchase 2000 minutes (at a cost 33% greater) for one year of service. If this is not evil, what is?"
1,Mahjongg video too short for price,"The video is sweet -- but BRIEF!! It's only 15-20 minutes long. That's a pretty short video for $25. I felt ripped off. I certainly didn't learn Mahjongg in that short time frame. If you are a beginner, you'd be better off with a Mahjongg book."
3,Needs Another Score,"There is much to like about this film, the story, the picture quality, the tinting and of course Anna May Wong. It's so good, in fact, it's a shame it wasn't a talkie, because it has the feel of one. My biggest complaint is with the score. I thought it one of the most annoying scores outside of a public domain release. You're watching a movie from the 20's listening to jazz from the late 40's or early 50's. To me it just didn't work. On top of that my daughter, who was in the other room listening, said it sounded like music from a bad late 70's film. I own several hundred silent films, several with scores by Neil Brand which I enjoyed. I really wish Milestone had offered an alternative score of more period appropriate music on this one because the film itself deserves 5 stars."
5,Jacobs does it again,"As a reader of Jonnie Jacobs' Kali books from the beginning, I really looked forward to Intent to Harm, and it lived up to my expectations. The characters were superbly realized--the hit man was so human, so understandable, but no less evil. The variouis viewpoints really engaged me.The plot kept me guessing untilthe end. And the relationship between Bryce and Kali was just just right. I love where it ended and can't wait for the next one."
1,No Intent to Look for Other Books by Jacobs,"Whilst this book started off at a pretty fast pace and was pretty interesting in the first couple of chapters the quality died off fast once Betty was killed and O'Brien injured. The rest of the book has the rather boring character O'Brien obsessed with trying to figure out what her dead client wanted. Meanwhile the injured hit man who sent the premature killing hit man that bungled the job wants to know just how much O'Brien knows. Sounds interesting from the description you say, you'd think that wouldn't you and I was one of you but in reality you'll struggle to stick with the boring storyline to the end of the book."
5,I really love this bow case,I really love this bow case and just bought another one 12/27/2012. It is really well made and provides good protection to the bow. I would recomend this product to anyone who owns a longbow.
3,Would be good...,"This would be a very intriguing story if not for some very blatant mistakes. This is written to be of true events in the 1920's, however I strongly recommend it be sent through an editor before reading. For example, police nor the general population used words such as ""dude"" and ""BVD' s"" in that era."
2,"Well...not as great as ""...Key Of Springfield""","Still decent. Have to remember that this is NOT a new album, it is a RE-release (the original release was just a little after the ""Sing the Blues"" album, very early 1990's. With that in mind, the songs do seem a little dated, but still this album is a must-add for the true Simpsons fan."
4,My review is on Yellow album - ???? is that right?,"Not as good as the Simspons past to, but still good. the art work on the cover is the best and I just hope they release a song or two off it like they did with 'Sing the blues'."
2,Worst Episode Ever?,"As cast members have done estimable work before, and during, The Simpsons' (Julie Kavner on ""Rhoda"" and with Woody Allen, Dan Castellaneta's ""Two Lips,"" etc.) long and mighty reign, the ""Yellow Album"" received an ""annoyed grunt"" from most Simpsons' fans, and a resounding, ""ha!"" on the charts. There's no need for the cast to record covers, or songs not included on ""The Simpsons,"" as the actors will have the rest of their careers to experiment. And, there's still (at least) another soundtrack CD to be compiled. Fortunately, this exercise in regicide was redeemed by the exquisite, ""Go Simpsonic."" Save for the awesome cover on the CD, this one's best left forgotten, unless you simply have to have everything with The Simpsons' name on it. Whatever record label executive encouraged this one should hang their head, look sad, and say ""d'oh."""
1,Unredeemed junk,"I'm as big a Simpsons fan as anyone, but this is hideous.There are four Simpons-derived albums on the market.Two are comprised of excerpts from the TV show. Those areboth terrific 4-5 star albums. There is another album ofall original (not from the TV show) material, The Simpsons SingThe Blues. That album was weak and a major disappointment, butit did feature a few (and only a few) amusing moments.This? The best moments on this CD are the bands of silencethat separate the tracks. How anyone thought this was worthrecording is beyond me. Why anyone spent money to releaseand promote it is WAY beyond me. It isn't funny and the music[stinks].Even if you are a completist, you don't need this. Trust me:I am a completist. I bought it and wish I hadn't. There isNOTHING on this album that merits your time or money.dap"
1,Disappointing at best...,"As with many of these reviewers, I am a Simpsons fan... Some even call me obsessed, what with my collection of episodes on tape and all... Unfortunately, when I picked up the ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CD, I was excited... Little did I know what PAIN I was in for... there are maybe two good songs on the CD... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EVEN IF YOU ARE A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW!!!"
1,I am shocked that something this bad was created,"Any true fan of the Simpsons will not believe their ears when they hear this pile. This album is filled with sticky sweet love songs, and cheap sounding rap tunes. The thing that sucks the most is that it takes itself so seriously. What happened to all the sarcasam and satire the Simpsons are famous for?? This album feels out of place and VERY dated. Save your money and buy ""Songs in the Key of Springfeild"" which features very funny music and dialog from the actual show."
2,Worst Simpsons album ever!,"The Simpsonsfirst albumwasn't that good, but it did manage to turn a profit. So they naturally recorded a follow up album soon afterwards. Apparently the record company wasn't too impressed with the results, because there was a slight delay in the release of the album. And by ""slight"" I mean approximately six years. To be fair to those record company executives who held back it's release, the album does have a few problems. The main one being that it's not funny. Let me repeat that: IT'S! NOT! FUNNY! At all! The whole album is pretty much a disaster. The first album was merely mediocre, but this one is downright bad. The ""highlight"" here is probably ""She's Coming Out Swinging"", where Lisa works with George Clinton's P-Funk All-Stars. That track is not too unbearable. As for the rest of the album, the less said the better. To quote Bart Simpson, ""I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows."""
1,Save your money.,"My family loves the Simpsons. We think it is consistently the best-written show on the air. So when Songs in the Key of Springfield was available we grabbed for it. It is a real treat -- 5 stars. We can put it on and listen all day. The Yellow Album, however, is a real disappointment -- ESPECIALLY in comparison to Springfield. The cover is clever and, unfortunately, the best part. This album stops its parody of Sgt Pepper when you open the CD. The songs are forced and amateurish. It's like Andy Rooney time: let's get a tape recorder and make an album and we'll save the school. Thank God the show isn't written like this. Oh, there are one or two good moments (especially in Apu's solo). But it's mostly pretty flat. Rarely worthy of a chuckle. Not worth the $12. However, if you are even mildly a Simpsons fan, the Springfield CD is required listening!"
5,The YELLOW ALBUM!,"This CD has the Simpsons singing 10 cool and funny songs. This CD has The P-Funk All-Stars and others. My favorite song is 9 Every Summer With You. This CD has Bart, Lisa, Homer, Krusty, Marge, and more. Buy this CD."
2,"I don't care what other people say,this cd.....what the hey","Since the day I bought this cd,I didn't know how it would be.But when I listened to it in my dads car,I FRICKIN LOVED IT.My favorite songs are ""Ten Commandments of Bart"" & "" I Just Cant help Myself"".I just love the beat in that song,and ""Shes Coming out Swinging"" ain't that bad.I like ""Sisters are doing it for Themselves""but,it's a girls song and they use the word ""female"" to much.You might think I'm crazy but,this cd is better than Simpsons sing the Blues somehow.I don't care what other people say,this cd.....what the hey."
3,A pretty average CD.,"I still think that Songs in the key of Springfield is the best Simpson CD yet,since it's got all the songs from the show.The Yellow Album is like Sing the Blues,all the songs are made up.Overall the Yellow Album is good,but if you're not a Simpson fanatic,don't buy it."
2,Couple of cool songs but the rest are stupid,"When i bought this i thought it would be cool, but its not. 24 hours is the best track by far, Love? is pretty good, and Ten Commandments of Bart would be good if it was shorter. She commin' out swinging is the worst song on the cd because there is basrely anything to do with the simpsons on it. Homer sounds like Grampa when he starts to sing. The cameos are lame also. The only good song is 24 hours a day, and i bet you can get that on MP3"
5,Another great Simpsons album!,"This album lasted for longer than I would have expected for ten songs, but then there are some long tracks. To say that there is no subtle comedy included here is a lie, because there's as much of it as there was with ""Sing The Blues"". From what I read in press releases, this album was meant to be LESS dance-orientated, but infact it is more so than its predecessor. Otto's Jimi Hendrix out-take on the last track was also quite amusing."
2,A Disappointment,"I've been a Simpsons watcher since 1991. I watched the show change over the years. I decided to give this album a try. Altogether, this album isn't as good as Simpsons Sing The Blues. But why did they release it at this time? The material here is over 6 years old, and you can tell. The only real bright spot on this album is the rock song ""Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves."" ""Funny How Time Slips Away"" is halfway decent, and it was nice to see Apu take over on ""24 Hours A Day."" They don't redeem the album, however. ""Love,"" ""10 Commandments Of Bart,"" and ""I Can't Help Myself"" are moldy rap tunes. George Clinton's song ""She's Comin' Out Swingin"" goes on WAY too long. The concept of ""Anyone Else"" is lame. ""Every Summer With You"" is cheesy, and ""Kamp Krusty"" didn't need to be made into a long suite. If you didn't watch the Simpsons earlier in the '90s and you were to get this album, you'd be disappointed. This album is best for fans of the older Simpsons style."
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I was almost angry at the poor content of this album. Songs in the Key of Springfield was absolutely delightful, and I've listened to it several times. The producers of the Yellow Album could easily have had another hit if they had stuck to the same formula. Where are ""We Put the Spring in Springfield"" and ""I'm Checkin' In"" and the other terrific songs that didn't make in onto Songs in the Key? The Yellow Album was a majorly bad idea."
2,"If you enjoyed 'The Simpsons Sing the Blues', listen to this","Otherwise, this is probably an album that you can pass up. In the same style of 'Sing the Blues', where the songs are written only to showcase the vocals of the voice actors from the show, the songs lack the humor that we all like The Simpsons for. If you're looking for an album true to the show, buy the album taken straight from the show, 'In the Key of Springfield', which I give 5 stars."
1,Can this really be The Simpsons?,"I found this CD appalling. While I understood when I was buying it that it didn't contain music used in the TV series per se, I was under the impression that the songs included might be at least somewhat entertaining or listenable. I was wrong on both counts. I thought the humor fell flat in virtually every song, and the vocals didn't even sound as good as they normally do in The Simpsons. Luckily, this recording has proven an aberration in Simpsons merchandising, and I've never seen something this bad again. Spare yourself this and get one of the infinitely better soundtrack albums instead."
4,Eye opening,"This is a great read for someone who is interested on what really goes on behind the scenes. You will discover that it's not all glitz and glamour in the wrestling world. Gary has class because he's honest but not cruel. He made me nostalgic for the ""good old days"" of wrestling. Gary makes the point that wrestling has turned into something that it didn't start out as. I believe sometimes wrestling does push the limits but I'm not sure it would reach as many people as it does today without these changes. A definite must-read for old school wrestling fans."
2,Not that great,"The people who are giving this book 5 stars must be lying or on crack. I have read about 10 wrestling books and this is one of the least interesting. There are two problems with this book. One is that there just isn't a lot of dirt here - and let's face it, we read these books to find out all the backstage insider information. The second problem is that I personally don't really care too much about what goes in to being a ring announcer. Cappetta makes it sound like he is very important to a wrestling event - when in fact - no one really cares about ring announcers."
5,If you love pro wrestling ...,"you'll enjoy this book. Gary shares great behind the scenes stories about the McMahons, Gorilla Monsoon, Flair, Undertaker, Abdullah, the list goes on and on. I've read all of the recent wrestling books that have hit the stands and I enjoyed this one and Dynamite Kid's the most. The story about how he got into announcing is surprising."
4,"NOT the best book about professional wresting, but ok.","I'm sure when the book was written, it was one of the first to take you behind the scenes and could have easily been classified as a ""tell-all."" For me, I've read most relevant wrestling books over the past 15 years and there are many that give much more colorful accounts of backstage antics.Capetta does bring an interesting twist as announcer, but if anything he didn't see as much as the true in ring performers. He was, however, a victim of underground politics by the same guys you've heard about throughout the years hwo have been known to screw wrestlers over.If you want an honest version from 10,000 feet - you'll be satisfied. If you are truly looking for brutal honesty, check out Foley's first, Graham, Piper, Blassie, or any one of Jericho's versions."
5,1 of the BEST books on Pro Wrestling,Ive read several pro wrestling bio books. While some are pretty good others leave a lot to be desired.. This book however is GREAT. I remember buying this book and meeting Mr. Cappetta at a Fair. Very nice guy and a gold mine of wrestling knowledge. Gary was fortunate enough to be the middle of the pro-wrestling world during a pivotal time in its history. His first hand experiences of legends in the ring and out are invaluable. His talent for writing as well as his unique point of view make this work not only Entertaining but Very memorable. I think I read this whole thing in 2 days!... Great Book! Great Guy!
5,"If you are a true fan, you will love this book!!","Cappetta does a magnificent job of guiding the viewer through the backstage life and politics of professional wrestling. It is good to hear about the world of wrestling from someone who is not a wrestler himself. If you want to hear the inside story on how WCW began its downfall, you will read it here. If you want to know the true character of such personalities as Vince McMahon, Ric Flair, Eric Bischoff, Dusty Rhodes and dozens of others, you will find it in this book. I definitely recommend it to any wrestling fan."
5,A Mentor's Guide,Applying the guidelines Laurent gives us will help turn almost anyone into a more effective mentor. Mentor: Guiding the Journey of Adult Learners is a necessary study book for those interested in serving as a mentor.
4,Got me what I needed,"Great book for an insight into mentoring which is what I've done quite a bit of, even prior to the purchase of this book."
4,I'm afraid I've been thinking.,"This box set features the music that Alan Menken and Howard Ashman wrote for three Disney animated films, plus copious bonus tracks. First, there isThe Little Mermaid, which features many demos in addition to the regular soundtrack. Second isBeauty and the Beast, again with the addition of several demos. Lastly, there isAladdin. Tragically, Howard Ashman died before this film was completed, so Tim Rice was brought in to help Menken finish the songs. Many Ashman/Menken demos of songs that did not make it into the movie are included. These songs were not dropped because of lack of quality, but rather because the storyline of the movie changed. For example, ""Proud of Your Boy"" is a great song that Aladdin would have sung to his mother, but it couldn't be used because the mother character was cut from the movie. This collection serves as a wonderful tribute to the late great Howard Ashman."
4,Good 3D show.,"This is not the coming at ya kind of video, but the picture has depth and explains how the shutter glasses work in 1985. Nothing offensive. Mild stuff, but enjoyable.Larry"
2,Worst Chargers Team Ever!!,"I am a long-time San Diego Chargers fan and I do not see why anyone would want to buy this video. The 2000 San Diego Chargers were absolutely terrible. The Chargers had terrible players, coach Mike Riley stunk, and the 2000 Chargers only won 1 single game the whole season defeating the Kansas City Cheifs 17-16. The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 star is because a still like the Chargers and believe that they have a great future ahead of them. Ultimately, their is absolutely no reason to buy this movie after such a horrible, and disgraceful season for the San Diego Chargers."
4,Comfortable reading,"For a Spanish language student who has taken 2 semesters, and is fluent in English, this is comfortable, somewhat entertaining material. After reading this book once for my Brandeis University class, during this summer I have read it 3 times more, because it is a nice way to review. It is very comprehensible material, and the glossary and notes make it is easy to look up unknown words if you need to. I am logged on right now to buy the next book in the series."
4,ALBUM ROCKS,"THE SECOND DISK IS THE KICKER. ORIGINALLY THE ALBUM CONTAINED ONLY ONE DISK. WITH THE SECOND DISK OF THE SET IS A MUST HAVE BECAUSE OF THE LIVE SONGS ON THE ALBUM. WITH THE EXEPTION OF MAIDEN, NO SONGS LIVE SOUND AS GOOD AS WASP'S. CHECK OUT HEADLESS CHILDREN AS WELL. ROCK ON!"
3,"Good, but TOO REPETITIVE","I'm a WASP fan. I've got all their stuff and I like most of it, including this one. But I have to say that I don't get why people praise this so much. It's good, no doubt about it. But I find it rather irritating to listen to, since so many of the songs have the EXACT SAME drums and chords. It's like the same song over and over with 10 different sets of lyrics (with the exception of a few songs that are truly different).Sure, the common chords/drums kind of tie the whole thing together. I understand that this is a concept record. But it's just too repetitive for me.On the up-side, there are some truly great tunes on here. Hold on to my Heart is an incredible song (very un-WASP, too). Bob Kulick does a commendable job on lead guitar, providing much more interesting and catchy leads than Chris Holmes ever did.People say this is WASP's best, and maybe I'm just nuts, but I like Inside the Electric Circus and Dying for the World much more than this one."
2,Do not listen to the above reveiwers; the album is (poor),"When I first heard of W.A.S.P. releasing a conceptual album, I was thinking of what an excellent album it will be. After hearing their first three masterpieces, this was gonna be their magnum opus. Was I wrong! First of all Chris Holmes doesn't play on the album, as a matter of fact the only original member left is Blackie Lawless, thus sounding more of a solo album. The magic from their previous incarnations is all gone. The songs go nowhere except for the ballad near the end of this mess. The guitar is lacking anything that Mr. Holmes could play and to top it all off the story is not the least interesting. To make a long story short, this was a disappointing CD..."
2,Wouldn't buy this watch again...,"I needed an inexpensive, sporty watch that I could order easily, and this one fit the bill. I liked the intensity of the color and the sleek shape that wouldn't catch on anything.While the watch lives up to these expectations, I wouldn't order it again. Its resin top scratches easily, blurring the watch face. I can imagine that within a few months, and with a few careless moves of my arm, I'll end up with a thoroughly unreadable watch.Also, despite having an average-sized wrist, the watch is uncomfortable and its slightly tapered ends dig a little into my skin, leaving me with small circular bruises on my inside wrist by the end of a few days. Since the band is molded resin, no adjustment is possible (without a blowtorch, that is...)It's eyecatching, it's a great color, but ouch! The thing hurts, and $50 is too much to pay for anything that causes discomfort. The watch gets 2 stars for working just fine."
5,The Most Complete and Informative History of Our Local Area,"Mr. Simon has outdone himself with this exceptional piece of work - not only a great read full of lots or great pictures, but an excellent historical resource that you'll refer to again and again! Nowhere else have I found such a comprehensive history of our local area..."
2,not thrilled,"This product must be made for a special type of sink. Since I started using it I end up with a puddle on the floor the run off has no side or not enough guides to stop water from running off on the counter,it just doesn't sit over the sink good. If that area of the product was changed I would love it, I do love the back and top, easy to wipe clean.I might have to replace it."
4,Sterling Silver Peridot Clip On Huggie Hoop Earrings,The earings were great. My Partner loved tham. Thanks for the prompt service.
2,Lucid but lacking,"Nelson presents the new physics in a manner that makes it easy to grasp and hold onto. Where he falls down is on the Judaism side. He dabbles a bit in Kabbalah and mysticism, but for the most part takes a comic-book perspective, not going into any depth on the Torah view of the religious issues he brings up. He is looking for nice metaphors, which he finds. He is not looking for the God of Judaism. It's understandable, for a Reform rabbi.There are much more satisfying books on the subject by serious scientists, who take a deeper perspective on religion. Paul Davies (whom Nelson cites) is preeminent. Gerald Schroeder and Howard Smith combine deep scientific and deep Jewish knowledge."
1,"Not at all user friendly, don't blow you money here.","I ordered this and took it to my astrologer, and she couldn't figure out how to use it. No book comes with this software, so if you need to buy something extra, they should say so. I went to thier web site looking for some clues, and could find no definitive answers. Spend an extra hundred and get the Keplar software, which even a novice like me can use."
1,I didnt like it,"It smelled like burning plastic, and tasted just like how id imagine bad plastic would taste. I dont recomend this product."
2,informative but disapointing,"An informative book that unfortunately failed to live up to its title. If your new to ASP programming I would personally recommend Sams Teach Yourself Active Server Pages 3.0 which goes into far more detail but also explains key concepts in a clearer manner.The book's cd did not seem to have all the files mentioned in the book which didnt help, and as yet i havnt been able to log into the books supporting website, just getting a VBscript error, which doesnt inspire much confidence!"
2,Sams Teach Yourself E-Commerce Programming with ASP in 21 Days,"book and programmingcode out off date (April 2000)software Microsoft personal webserver not available any moreProgrammingcode and function doesn't work, to many errorsif you try it out with newer personal webserver (2005)"
4,Good book for E Commerce Developers !!,"This might not be a very suitable book for a beginner, but even you are a beginner, you better to buy this book as a reference point then to check out things you don't understand from this book.I knew only a little ASP when I started this book, but the tasks go from simple to more complex in a very smooth manner.So if you're looking to build a store or develop an e-commerce application using ASP, this one's for you!"
4,Very Good overview,"If you are a programmer, 21 days is probably a bit much. If you do 8 hr days, you can finish this in a week, tops.I bought three ASP books when I began learning asp several weeks ago, and this by far has been the best book. Nothing beats the learning approach. The other two texts serve as good reference books, but this is what taught me how to do things.The end of the week wrap up exercises are good, but while they lead you to believe they build on each other, they actually recode a different approach to the same object and then add new functionality in the later reviews. Also, reference is made to inc files, which don't seem to work anymore in the latest browsers. Rename your inc files to asp files and it should work just fine."
3,There is one big error in the examples !!! fix it here,"I like the book so fare... But I sure got stuck in day 8 !! Because the code in storefuncs... does not work at my computer.I use office 98 and win 98 and Personal Web Server and IE5. You can remove the error - if you remove line 12 in storefuncs...If you wan't to use the code you got to read all the chapters, they edit/add and make changes to old files as the go along.Hope I could help. (Still a ok book)"
3,"Good, but I have a few problems with it","Overall, this book was helpful. I am relatively new to ASP and ecommerce. One major problem I found was this: the author says that the best way to make a shopping cart is to have the user log in BEFORE adding things to the cart. Well, from my experience, most sites let you add things to your cart, and THEN prompts you to log in. To change this one minor thing in the author's code is not trivial, especially for a beginner. At least as far as I can tell."
3,Not for indy designers,"If you don't have your own server this thing shows you no mercy. If you have access to a (NT4) server and you can change stuff on there yourself then go for it. If not, be prepared to be stopped in your tracks after day 4. If you can't find a way to call your ODBC connection then you're SOL. It tells to set up MS PWS on your personal machine but I'd reccomend going for a cheap extra machine and run linux/php-MySQL/Apache."
3,Beginners STAY AWAY!!!!!!!,"If you are new to programming, I suggest you avoid this book at all costs. I would have though that after 4.5 years programming 21 days to learn anything is enough time but not in this case. There are a number of examples that have ""typos"" in them and unless you can program, spotting them is not easy. Nice and easy style of writing in the beginning seriously alters later in the book clearly stating the work of another author. It becomes very technical and extremely ""beginner unfriendly"".Having said all that, I would recommend this book as ONE of the reference books you use while programming in ASP. I hope this helps."
2,Poor choice,"Not what I expected, the seams are huge and it's difficult to get my hand around my 1911. Ill give these glove to my grandson as a expensive toy, no feel in fingers when on and mag changes suffer as I simply can't feel what it is I'm doing.Still in the market for a GOOd set of gloves.DW"
1,nothing to rare as it seems,if i was you i'd go find good bye babylon or down in the basement by joe bussard before i'd ever consider this thing it's really not worth it
4,"some of it awesome, some of it ...","Dude,When they want to rock out, Heep slays all. When they get fruity, it simply lacks. This will not make some fans of Heep happy but it's true for this cowboy. The two discs comprise about one full disc of GREAT material. That's pretty good ratio. Hard to find in stores. Pick it up here and start your Easy Livin"
4,"Pretty Definitive, From Their Classic Years","Uriah Heep made some really interesting progressive/hard rock in the early seventies and I must say that this collection does them justice, and includes nearly all of Demons And Wizards, their best album. If you are unfamiliar it's a great place to start. Often unfairly compared to Deep Purple because of similar instrumentation, Heep had a sound of it's own. I'd like to see a volume 2 of this anthology featuring the John Lawton era (last interesting period for them) which I feel is underrated while not quite as brilliant as the David Byron years."
1,So bad it's silly,"Their is a very good reason this band is not in the Rock and Roll hall of fame: They are not good. The guitar solos are basic, the music itself is simplistic, and the lyrics, my god the lyrics. I've never heard sillier trash. Just listen to ""The Magician's Birthday"". ""I have a sword of hate,"" ""My answer is simply, an impenetrable fortress of love."" Puhleeez. This band is the epitome of bad 70s art rock. They were trying to be deep and artistic. They failed."
2,Wenzel screen room,"I use this for camping. You need at least 3 people to set up, I was hoping it would only take 2. When it rains, because of the gazebo shape, the rain poured in the sides. Had to stay in the middle to stay dry. Not worth the price."
2,horrible if only slightly windy,there were more good reviews than bad ones here. so we bought one. we just got back from a 4 day camping trip. this item was horrible. flimsy and 'light'. we ended up having to create tie downs for it just to keep it upright. i wasted $100. I am NOT happy.
3,Good but...,"Good design. Stood up to @30mph gusts. Great size for ALPS Mountaineering Dining Table (XL) which Measures 28 inches wide by 55 inches long by 28 inches tall easily surrounded by 4 chairs, comfortably even 6 chairs...plus two large coolers. Comes w/ pouch to carry. Stakes work well but are thick plastic not metal. Would have given 4 or maybe 5 stars BUT, product was so old the bungees broke during 1st assembly and the did not have water repellancy. That being said, we called Wensel Ontario, got an RMA# for the bungees and sent them with a strongly worded letter. They sent us a whole new gazebo. Can't wait to try this one out."
5,Good quality product,"This is an attractive, high quality product that is easy to set up. We saw screen tents at K-Mart that were less expensive, but extremely low quality. If you plan on using a the tent more than once, the Wenzel is a good choice. Very spacious feeling. Do stake it down, however, or it will blow away in a stiff breeze."
4,Wenzel Gazebo,"This product lived up to my expectations when I ordered it. It was fairly simple and fast to set up, is quite roomy, and does keep bugs out. The only problem I've encountered is that the very bottom plastic of the sides of the tent don't roll under the way they should in some places - probably because of unevenness of the ground underneath it."
2,It works,The plastic is thin(mine showed up broken)but for what I paid it doesn't matter. AS far as charging the phone it works like it should and is actually quite fast. The plug end for the phone is tough to get in and out.
3,Short-lived happiness,I love it but it broke as soon as I tried to snap it on. It would also have helped if it came with a belt clip.
2,Knock Off,"These are 100 hits from the 80's, but NOT from the original artists. Some songs sound good, but others are a poor knock-off. Wish there would have been some ""warning"" prior to purchasing. Yes, the artist name was ""Countdown Singers"" but who would have known that didn't mean ""various artists"". Lesson learned. Guess the $6 price tag should have been some kind of indication. So, get this if you want to hear 80's hits performed by American Idol wanna-be's."
1,Caveat Emptor - NOT the original artists,"When I saw the selection of songs in this collection I was excited and I ""1-clicked"" the purchase before reading the reviews. A few minutes later I was saddened to realize that my trip down nostalgia lane was instead a trip to a karaoke bar. There are definitely some talented folks singing many of the songs, but there is no way the description of this collection should not have explicitly mentioned that these are not the original artists!Fortunately, I contacted Amazon support via email complaining about the above and they responded (in less than an hour) saying they refunded my money! Go Amazon!!"
1,BLAH,I wish I would have read the reviews.. I didn't realize this wasn't original artists also.. I WANT to return it!
2,poor editing of patterns mars a good book,"It is unfortunate that the errors in the hardback edition were not corrected in the paperback edition. There are errors in many of the patterns that may not be obvious to a beginning knitter or even a knitter trying new things. This is very unfortunate, because the sweaters themselves are quite lovely."
2,"Great photos, appealing patterns, but serious errors.","This book has beautifully photographed pictures of veryappealing designs--but--The one pattern I have tried has serious errors in thedirections. For example, on page 69, ""ZICKZACK"" has moirerib at cuffs and bottom.1) Directions say moire rib is""multiple of 6 + 2"", then for small size directs to cast on84 stitches.2) Directions for Front and Back never say to change tolarger needles.3) Shape of shoulder directions assume (in all sizes)that there are an even number of stitches at shoulder.There are not."
3,Not the greatest,"The sweaters are okay--but there is better stuff out there. I was very disappointed when I wrote to the author/publisher to get a pattern for the hat that was shown with some aran sweaters. What do you mean there's no pattern available--get real.This one is okay if you can get it used, but it is obviously (see the book title) a book written to sell yarn, not a great pattern book."
2,Not too original,"There are a whole bunch of burger cookbooks out this spring and I bought three. This one came in third; pictures were kind of bland, and recipes seemed vaguely familiar. Nothing too original here. The others had ideas that I never would have thought of. Burgers Every Way and The Great Big Burger Book are better collections of new ways to make burgers."
3,2000 Giants Year Book,The VHS Tape on the NY Giants 1999 75th Diamond anniversary season was a short but sweet review. The Giants finished with a 7 and 9 record but brought back some memmories.
5,Good Tape.....,"Being a huge New York Giants fan, I have to admit the 2000 season was a disappointment because of the poor showing in the superbowl but a successful season by making it to the superbowl. This video is filled with highlights from the 2000 season, including the famous playoff guarantee by Jim Fassell. Also included are the big playoff wins against the Eagles and the 41-0 drubbing of the Vikings. If you're a big Giants fan like myself, I definetly recommend this video."
4,AMM 7.3,"I like the book it is different, because of the way she uses the different world how they can't make different choices. I thought that she used new words to express the feelings about Jonas and The Giver. I also thought that she used the advantage of them not having choices, because it made them realised that ""Elswhere"" really exixted.I didn't like the ending it was making me hang of the edge of my seat. It made me think about the ending and how Jonas got to elsewhere. She needs more of the ending or the sequel to the book. I do agree about the way she described about not having a sequal though."
5,"""I don't think I can wait until the eclipse""","This volume is just one long fight between Guts and the Black Dog. Another tough opponent shows up, and we quickly get the sense that he is not human, which may represent Guts' toughest challenge yet. Also, he seems familiar, doesn't he? Although this installment is mostly about fighting, the quality is still outstanding, due to the high intensity, to the constant sense of doom and to Guts trying to overcome it.The nature of this volume is such that the violence escalates, reaching an all time high in the series, especially with the deeds performed by the Demon Dogs. This, once again, allows for an impressive display of Miura's drawing skills. But this volume is not only about violence, since the demons provide Griffith, Guts and the rest of the Band with some important information about the future as it relates to the eclipse. Ohh, and there is a very special visitor towards the end. I cannot wait to see what happens next!"
2,"Obviously, was not a new tape.","The quality was ok, but the last minute, the tape was defective. There must be a scratch or something that interrupted the sound - could not hear the last of the dialogue. Very disappointed."
4,Freeway Cruising,"To be up front, the only Concrete Blonde song I had heard before picking up this collection of was the hit song "" Joey"". Upon listening to this disc I must admit I was very impressed. Cruising down a desert highway or just hitting your favorite straightaway, this cd sets the tone.My favorite track would have to be ""mexican moon"" , but all the songs have a haunty(is that even a word?) old west feel to them. Johnette Napolitano's voice definitely delivers the goods, going from crystal highs to whiskey lows.The only snag I have is their cover of Janis Joplins ""mercedes benz"". It isnt awful but it wasnt a high point for me. So drop the top and pop this disc in.... you wont be disappointed."
3,Hard to believe this is really a greatest hits CD,"The classics on this CD are, well, classics: Ghost of a Texas Ladies Man, Mexican Moon, Someday, God is a Bullet. But if the rest of the songs were collected as regular release instead of a best of, it would be a mixed bag. Some are catchy, and some sound very dated (e.g. Dance Along the Edge). The short version of Bloodletting is also disappointing, with the catchy chorus only sung twice."
1,These people took my money and NEVER sent me my CD.,"I Ordered this CD in the begining of december,as a christmas present, it's now the middle of febuary, and I still do not have my CD. Ive sent many e-mails, ive asked them to call me and all ive gotten is e-mails back saying that they sent it and we must be thieves.Its been about 60 days and the only thing that has been exchanged is my money to there hands. Someone from ABC Sounds needs to make this right. Ive confirmed my address many times, ive asked how they ship it, I only orderd from them because they had a good rating, but this is beyond rediculous, If they are unable to send what I ordered then give me my money back."
5,Sylvia Browne book collector,I enjoy very much all of the material Sylvia Browne has out them. Thanks for the salesmanship and quick delivery of merchandise. AAA++++++
1,They forgot to add the good songs!,"I saw the movie and was totally hyped about the soundtrack! so i rushed out to get it.. and to my complete disappointment.. all the really cool techno tracks and mixes made by Moby were NOT in it! all it has is all the rap music that I didnt want! To my complete annoyance.. since the cd is now open, warehouse music will not exchange the title.. so i am stuck with a cd with none of the jams I wanted... If you liked all the cool dance hits in the movie.. DONT BUY THIS CD... they are not in it! :("
2,Disappointed,"My friends and I were totally psyched about purchasing this CD after watching the movie. However, to our surprise we very disappointed when we listened to the CD. The main songs that pumped you up throughout the movie were not on the CD! Most of the songs on the CD were the minor background songs that we couldn't remember even hearing these songs during the movie! This CD could have been a hit. If they are smart, they will put out a second CD that is the ""true"" soundtrack to the movie."
3,It's alright,I have to defend this. The Hole song is worth five stars. The Godsmack song is too.All those rap songs are the problem.
5,great little book,I bought six of the paperback rabbit books for my 22 month olddaughter and she loves them. The little rabbits are so cuteand the author is very creative in the way he integrates learningconcepts into the plot of the stories. These books are definitewinners at a reasonable price.
5,A Wonderful Member of a Wonderful Series,"A beautiful concept book with a very likable character. The text and illustrations go well together, making the whole book comprehensible for young readers eager to learn."
1,Junk,We bought these for our kids and neither of us were impressed. A complete waste of money and we would not buy again.
5,For Reel!,"Actually I own only half of this, the slot and video poker pack. It is simply the best slot game anywhere. If the Masque games get 5 stars, this gets 6. Never seen their (table) poker game, but it looks excellent.I also just got Reel Deal Slots and VP 2, which the slots are better, some carry-overs, but haven't figured out the VP. Its not the same. It is like Maasque's Multi-play, It's advertized as single or multi-play; but all I can get is 10-handed. But all in all this is excellent.If you can find Phantom-EFX products, buy them. but make sure you have room on your hard drive. These are very graphic and sound intensive. Almost like being there."
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","The mirror installed just fine on my 2001 Grand Cherokee, electronics work and all. The only issue is the glass seemes like it's hardly attached so it shakes alot when driving making it a little difficult to see the reflection."
3,Looks better than a broken one.,"This item I a good match in form, fit and color. However, the mirror shakes around much, much more than the OEM version. Probably won't buy another one."
1,cheep,had to make wire longer on my 04 overland and the mirror shakes when driving cheep replacement if you are going to sell the car
1,They still owe me A mirror,The mirror they sent me was no good. They said they were going to send me A new one for the driver side on my Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado. I am still waiting for 6 months. I called and called they don't answer.
1,Terrible,"I rented this collection from my local library, and I'm thrilled now that I didn't buy it. I think only 3 or 4 of the songs on the complete collection are from the original artists. A big selection are (less-than spectacular) live recordings, and the rest are awful knock-offs.Don't waste your money, even Oldies radio is better than this."
5,"Great product, hope i never need to use it!","Had this installed by an electrician last week. An existing sub-panel i had on my 40 year old home was on a recall list. So, my electrician just ripped out the sub-panel and replaced it with this transfer switch. I have most of my home interior lighting, all major appliances gas: furnace,washer,dryer,range,range fan,dishwasher, refrigerator, TV, and home office wired up to the transfer switch. I only have a 6500 watt Continuous portable gas generator from Costco so i can't run all of these items simultaneously. After we fired up the generator we tried the transfer switch and was amazed that i had lighting almost throughout the whole house. This is a must have if you live in an area prone to natural disasters. I'm using it primarily in case of earthquake since i'm in California."
1,Very adult,"I exspected a vampire series, but it is strange short stories. All very explicit with adult situations. Only one story about vampires, very disappointed!"
4,Hunger..Season 1,"I absolutely loooove this series.. although the copy I got didn't have close captioning.. (some of the sound was washed out..)but all in all I thought this was a great series of chilling stories..it was like watching Twilight Zone on drugs!! I especially enjoyed the episode with Karen Black and Daniel Craig.. Ms. Black (Trilogy of Terror) is always fun to watch as she chews up the scenery!! There wasn't much blood, but plenty of explicit sex!! I wouldn't say this is scary..but it definitely gives you the creeps!"
3,Hunger Review,"Having enjoyed the True Blood series, I thought I would try this out. It has it's moments and can be entertaining, but because it is fairly dated, the production shows it's age.It is also typical of the the type of ""shock"" entertainment that was done for adult TV back then. The True Blood series is a much better production.All of these stories are unrelated which can be a good and a bad thing. As a result of them being unrelated it probably took me a lot longer to work my way through it.If you like this type of story, I would recommend trying the True Blood series first."
2,Not Very Likable,"I have always loved the monster genre, but I cannot seem to get into this anthology. The horrible opening credits combined with the moody Terence Stamp monologues together create a dissonant transition from one story to the next. The stories themselves are okay. The acting in each story seemed fine, but don't buy this because you like one particular actor. Each episode contains a completely new cast."
2,Eagle 1,"It's not a very bad series but it's not what my wife or I expected it to be! The cover showes vampires and we look at the first two disc and not one vampire to be found! I'm sure once we finish the series we will at lease see one, but the whole point was to see vampires that's why I bought it because the wife likes vampires!!!!"
2,unexpected,"This wasn't exactly what I expected it to be, but any fans of masters of horror will like it."
3,No captions..,It was good overall and I probably should have checked to see if there were subtitles for this which there are obviously none. I am hearing impaired and wish more older shows would have subtitles and the ones on the tv did not work aswell! This is very irritating for me since I would have enjoyed watching this but could not understand anything. oh well its decent though
5,"Go Dora!!! -A review of ""Dora's Big Book of Stories""","My son (just turned four) loves this big book of Dora stories and what is not to like. The pictures are super colorful and FILL up the page.There are 7 stories inside, plus a Spanish Word Guide on page 190.**Chapters**Dora's Book of MannersDora Goes to SchoolDora's Fairy-tale AdventureDora's Chilly DayShow Me Your Smile (about a visit to the dentist)Dora's Pirate AdventureBig Sister Dora!NOW for the Downside:--At least some of the Stories in this book are shorter versions of one's available singly.--The book is not very sturdy. The copy we borrowed from the Library (which is supposed to be better made that what we can buy) was falling apart: pages slipping out as if not bound well.Five Stars. Despite it's BIG drawbacks, my son adores this book and so it is a good value for us. Big colorful pictures. Good Read-aloud. If your child is enamored of Dora, this might be a good purchase."
5,Great Purchase!,Great book. Very colorful with lots of pictures of Dora and her friends. Perfect for little Dora fans. Great variety of short stories.
3,Dora's Big Book of Stories,This book is so well written that it is a joy to read. My Grandkids love it and would let me read from it every night if I would let them. I am so glad I bought this book for them and plan to buy one for the other three sets of Grandkids for Christmas.
1,After the Fact,"I received the book and good timing, and well protected...I must say. But I tried to contact someone about returning this item because it was the wrong edition for my class and have not received any responses."
5,An extremely important read for our times,"R. Rubenstein's The cunning of history was one the most Germane books I have read in the course of my College years. Deceptively short, it is very powerful and cuts across many genres of studies whether it be history, religion, philosophy or political science. It is controversial (he argues why the holocaust was an advancement of civilization- but you must read this in context of his explanation). Very provocative. This book is one I encourage everyone to read. This book is a 10."
1,Very disappointed,"I had this stroller for approximately 2 months. The buckle on the back of the stroller that holds the harness broke. I got the round around. The two service centers that are located in Los Angeles will not service my stroller. After spending $200 on this stroller, I am left stranded."
