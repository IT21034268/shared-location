2,Can you say POS?,"Well, after spending 3 hours on the phone with idiots, one finally tells me the device isn't working! NO S&#%, I could tell that! Frankly I would have gave it 1 star, but there is such a thing as a lemon and my luck is lousy. ;) I haven't desided if I'm going to try this product again or not...at this point I've desided to shop around a little more."
1,Forget WRT54GX2 if needing VPN,"Router seems fine for general use, however based on my experience, posts by numerous people, and Linksys support, a VPN pass through connection CANNOT be made....beware!"
1,The power adapter,I have asked about the power adapter spec to Linksys support. They have answered as follows.>Thank you for contacting Linksys Support.>I checked with our Product Management and got the following >information for the WRT54GX2:>Model Number: AD 12/1C POWER ADAPTER>Model Number: HA-12100EC-230>PRI: 230V - 50Hz>SEC: 12V 1000mA 12VAHow do you feel about that? I can not belive!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I spent a whole afternoon trying to get this product to work on a laptop and three PC's. Three were running XP and the other windows 2000. None of the machines with the exception of the the pc it was connected to could get a signal from the router. And forget about service.....the ""chat technicion"" didn't even ask what my problem was before trying to get me to download router configuration instructions. After I told him I was communicating through the router he began to slow his responses and gave me no help what so ever. This was the WORST product and service experience I have ever had. Again, do not buy this product if you want a good wireless network in your house........go somewhere else and forget this one.Caveat Emptor!"
1,THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW AGAINST SHIPPING SUCH A LOW QUALITY PRODUCT...,"My older D-Link router stopped working, so it seemed like a good opportunity to upgrade to a newer technology. Well, the Linksys is not it.I have one desktop computer that has a wired NIC, and two laptops with wireless. My printer is attached to the printer port on the desktop. I use a peer-to-peer network to print from my laptops. Unfortunately, the Linksys does not permit this configuration. It keeps the wired and wireless computers on separate peer-to-peer networks with no way to bridge the networks.Secondly, the documentation you get with the Linksys is extremely poor. It looks like the marketing guy decided to include a PDF brochure on the CD and call it a manual. The manual was obviously not written by someone who understands computer networks.Thirdly, the router tends to lock up. I have only had the router installed for about 18 hours, and I have had to reset it twice. I am definitely returning this one."
2,Router dies before second birthday,"I have had this SRX200 router for less than 2 years and it recently started becoming intermittent and it disconnects from the modem every few minutes. Very annoying, and should have never happened."
4,Its guitar and flute mastery with twist of latin flavor,"I usually pick up all Concord Picante's releases for they are good. I have not heard of Jeff Linsky and see that Besame Mucho was in the list I had mixed feelings, could this be light instrumental? at first I thought I was right, if you could place all your music collection in order, then this cd would be close to the boundary of fine instrumental easy listening... yet after listening some more I began to find profoundness in the spanish guitar 8specially in the version of Besame Mucho), then I realized that the flute was a key element having resemblance to Dave Valentines... that were I would use it? bright days for decompressing, at the bar-b- q with friends, better at the pool.."
1,They lie about their products!,"They claimed that it was the 1993 version of the album but it was not. It very clearly stated on the back that it was the 1997 version. This is important because the 1993 version had a superior mastering job, one that had a much better dynamic range than the 1997 version while being equivalent in all other areas.Do not trust their product descriptions! They will fraudulently claim it is a rarer product than it actually is and thus charge more for it. They should be banned from the Amazon Marketplace for this abhorrent behavior.I have attempted to return the product and am still trying to sort everything out."
5,"Great UV sensor at reasonable price, and very convenient","Learned a lot about how much UV radiation there was, and when/where. Even in the shade there can be a significant amount. Highly recommended."
1,Piece of junk!,"Summary: WORTHLESS TOOL! Like few other reviews have mentioned, Cobra Auger does not have a handle so it is very difficult to keep it in place and the plastic tubing is worthless because it breaks easily.Detail: So the story goes... I have clogged toilet, after reading reviews I decided to take a chance on Cobra Auger to 'do the job'. As soon as I stuck it in the toilet, gave it a few clock wise rotations, it got stuck and would not come out. With a little bit of struggle, the cheap plastic tubing broke off and NOT having a handle did not make my life any easier. After 10 minutes of struggle and few more broken plastic pieces I FINALLY managed to pull the auger out and the best part is 'TOILET IS STILL CLOGGED!'. I am putting this broken worthless tool in the garbage and heading out to the box store to buy something sturdy!"
4,"Ahrr, poop the poop decks, raise the main sails!","Ok, of course its low-budget, its just good old boys and girls havin some good old pirate'in fun!I didn't like the censure shipping of the boobies and the quality is purely armature but hey, like did ya ever thinks that old salty dog pirates even had cameras???I'd be lovin to see some more of them pirate babes however, and I do mean 'More of'!;p"
5,Road To Ruin is an all-time classic,"Although I am for the most part devoted to music of the 1960s, not '70s, this record has become one of my all-time favorites. The Ramones have captured the essence of great rock and roll: simplicity, emotion, and that raw edge that originated in the blues.The faster songs, like ""I Wanna Be Sedated,"" pack a lot of power. But I think the slow ones are superb. Their rendition of ""Pins and Needles"" is a beauty. Here, even a punk rock band shows it can convey sensitive and very real male emotions in an extraordinary way. The same power and sensitivity come through in ""Questioningly."" In these songs male sexuality and male emotion are merged.The Ramones in this album show they have indeed mastered the art of songwriting."
5,ROAD TO RAMONES!!!!,"I really like all the RAMONES albuns...some ones are better than others, but in fact they all sound the same...But the first 4 albuns from the RAMONES are soooooooo RAW and PUNK...It's so greaT!!!! ROAD TO RUIN is CERTAINLY ONE of the best of the many good albuns RAMONES did... TOTAL CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not their best,"This is a good album, but not their best. If you're new to the Ramones, start with an anthology or with one of their excellent first three albums: The Ramones, Leave Home, or Rocket to Russia. Sadly, the Ramones started going downhill with this one."
5,The Ramones' Best (?),"Don't listen to the likes of Legs McNeil (whose inappropriate liner notes all but damn this album as some kind of sell-out. Note to Rhino: why be so apologetic?). The fact is, you can pretty much defend any Ramones album as being their best, well beyond the indisputable classics of the 1970s (my other favorites - ""Halfway to Sanity,"" ""Brain Drain,"" and ""Adios Amigos,"" none of which are considered great by allegedly in-the-know rock critics). In many ways, ""Road to Ruin"" is their best album, the one that truly marks the end of an era for the band, their euphoric highs with their disenchanted lows. It mixes strung-out nihilism with gooey bubblegum so deftly that its simplicity, once again, somehow managed to fly way over people's heads. In any case, the greatest punk was founded on bubblegum aesthetics, and the Ramones knew this better than anyone on the planet at the time...and ""It's A Long Way Back"" is the greatest album closer ever."
5,A Perfect Album,"I don't know for sure if this is the best of the Ramones' albums, but that's just because this is the first one I've bought. What I do know, however, is that this album is almost completely flawless. Every song on this CD is good; there is no filler whatsoever. Even the bonus tracks are good. Okay, so the two demo tracks aren't AS good as the rest, but they're not bad at all. I know if you've heard of the Ramones that you've heard ""I Wanna Be Sedated"", but this album has a bunch of other great tracks as well, such as ""I Just Want To Have Something To Do"", ""I Wanted Everything"", ""Don't Come Close"", and ""She's The One"". All I know is this is one album that I will NEVER regret buying. I will listen to it over and over again. If you don't own it, you have no idea what you're missing!"
5,The best album by one of the great punk bands!,"I love the Ramones, and to me this is the best record they ever did. The energy, songwriting and production are all top-notch. Many of these songs were featured in their movie ""Rock & Roll High School"" - also HIGHLY recommended! One of the best albums ever for this period of punk rock!"
2,Good overview of the case; shoddy conclusion,"This is the first book I have ever read about Lizzie Borden. I was aware of the basic facts when starting this book, and I was pleased to find that it presented a fairly comprehensive overview of the case. However, the accusation of a secret son of Andrew Borden's just doesn't make sense. The entire theory of his guilt is based on the testimony of one or two people and their vague recollections of years long past. It seems that Brown found a new theory that hadn't been played out before, and then manipulated the facts AROUND that theory, instead of letting the facts speak for themselves. There is absolutely NO EVIDENCE that William Borden had anything to do with the crime, and the entire last chapter consists of pages and pages of pure speculation."
2,"Well, it started out good...","I was extremely disappointed with this book. Mr. Brown does have a gift for writing, and the first several chapters were nicely arranged to pique one's interest in the final explanation promised at the end. Having put my nose to the grindstone to get quickly to this explanation of what really happened that day, I was very upset when I reached it. The author fails to wrap up many (even most?) of the loose ends he creates. Worse, his ability to creatively excite the imagination in the eariler chapters becomes a handicap in this flop of a finale."
3,If you're really a scholar of the Borden murders then. . .,"you should know that lizzie didn't kill anyone. Dig into the life of Bridget Sullivan, if you can, and you'll find the REAL killer. May Lizzie and her truth rest in peace. She was a good woman who loved her father and helped a lot of people. There's was no evidence to convict her then and there's none still."
1,so freaking dumb,"I rented this book from the library, read it to my 3 year old, and decided that there must be pages missing. After looking it up here on Amazon and reading the reviews, I realized it's not mising pages, it's just a REALLY dumb book. This book made me want to write my own children's book because if this book can get published and go for 14 dollars on Amazon, I could be a freaking millionaire."
1,Worthless Book,"This book has no moral or purpose. The main character admires his neighbor across the street. This neighbor kid seems to have it all: lots of toys and parents that bow to his every whim. I expected the story to end with a lesson that money and things don't bring happiness. Instead, the main character just decides to imagine they are friends. I wanted to scream with disgust when I read the last page. Also, why is there a nude kid on the cover?"
1,Skip this one,"This book was depressing. As I turned each page, watching the narrator-child covet all of the wonderful things he presumes his neighbor has, I assumed that in the end there would be a moral of sorts. Perhaps he would learn that the older boy did not indeed live as wonderfully as he thought. Nope. Instead, the ending makes the narrator-child look pathetic and sad. The recommended age for this book is 4-8, and I think that's a little too young to teach children that ""life sucks and the closest you'll ever get to perfection is in your imagination, kid"".We also own The Daddy Mountain by the same author, and that one is much better. It also has no moral to learn, but at least it doesn't suck the hope right out of you."
3,Not Powered,For some reason I had thought that being USB would mean that this product would be able to run by just plugging it into my laptop. But it must be also plugged into an outlet in order to draw enough power. It works well as a CD/DVD drive but it won't solve my problem of needing a drive while on a plane.
3,Meh...,"Love Keven Smith. Loved the last 2 DVD's. This one falls way short. Found it boring and drawn out.He takes one subject and talks about it for what seems like an hour. Then wanders off into something else and babbles on. I know, I know... He's always done that! But THIS time its a little boring.As another reviewer stated, there isnt much about movie making in there, nor about comics, which are things his audience want to hear about. Thats the entertaining stuff I want to hear from Keven in these things.There are some funny bits in there though too. Some I heard already (Opie and Anthony), and some other funny stuff.I guess they cant all be winners.If youre a major fanboy like I am, pick it up. But Im sure you'll agree that it seems to drag on. If you wanna know about Kevs dogs, jump on this sucker...."
3,"Good, but not great","I am probably the world's biggest Kevin Smith fan. I own everything he has released on DVD or in print. Given that, it is with a heavy heart that I say this one is not as good as the two previous incarnations. It's good, especially if you haven't read his books or listened to his smodcast. For the diehard, though, there is precious little new material.One of the things that made his previous ""Evening With..."" discs so wonderful was seeing his interactions with the crowd -- beyond just the regular Q and A, such as dealing with hecklers, making phone calls to bosses, etc. There's none of this. No particularly interesting questioners, and not much (in 5 hours)in the way of movie making anecdotes -- most of the good stuff comes in the ""special features"" on disc 2. There's plenty of ""TMI"" (too much information) moments, so be warned. It's a decent disc, but if you had to pick, I'd go for Evening 1 and 2, in that order."
4,"If you liked the other two, buy it.","I don't think it was as great as the other two but it is certainly better than nothing.Pros: It is another two disc package of Kevin Smith rambling on for 20 minutes when a yes or no answer would have worked.Cons: It is more obvious this time around that he had stories he wanted tell and it didn't matter what the question was.So again, if you liked the other two Kevin Smoth Evenings, buy it. If you didn't, don't."
4,The first two were better,"I am a Kevin Smith fan. I thought the first two An Evening With's, were better, this one seemed planned ahead, like he had some stories he wanted to tell and forced these stories as answers. Don't get me wrong, the stories are entertaining, they just seemed forced. I think the main part of the DVD lasted about 3 1/2 hours and he answered maybe 6 questions. The extras consisted of additional questions which I found to be more entertaining."
4,Another excellent entry in Kevin Smith's speaking career,"Kevin Smith is a natural storyteller and nothing is off limits in his latest speaking tour DVD. From how he got his dogs to acting in ""Live Free & Die Hard"", Smith is hilarious throughout. Still not the excellence that was the first ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"", but a must for any Smith fan."
4,Good,If you enjoyed the other evening with Kevin Smith DVDs you'll enjoy this one. Kevin Smith is great at telling a story and he'd really funny here.
4,Nicely made!,"I bought this particular brand and model of illuminated magnifier after researching them thoroughly. This one had good reviews and came with an extra lens (nice!)The packaging was somewhat flimsy, but the unit was undamaged.I set it up and Voila! No adjustments were necessary. There aren't any anyway.The lamp stays where it's positioned and is easy to move.This unit is well made and well finished.I haven't tried the 2nd (more powerful) lens yet, but the instructions make changing lenses seem easy.I am happy with this magnifier!"
2,THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY,"There is little to say regarding this DVD entitled; ""The Secret is There Are No Secrets"" by Cheri Huber.There is little doubt that Ms. Huber is well versed in the art of ZEN meditation techniques. However, within the first 5 minutes most of her accumulated knowledge on ""zazen"" (sitting) is explained to the viewer. After the initial introductive techniques there is little else for her to really say. In order to extend the film, she sometimes becomes repetitious in her explanations, and then...the director (?), injects still shot frames of distorted photographs along with sounds of running water to help give the production more of a meditative aura.The DVD has no time-information on it, but I would guess the entire running of the DVD was perhaps....20 or 30 minutes at most.Truthfully speaking, I was extremely disappointed in this production and for the price of $14.95; there simply should have been ""something"" more to it."
2,Catchy title... lacks substance,"I would've enjoyed more in-depth discussion about Zen meditation in general, its philosophy, benefits, and so on. Instead, this is a step-by-step instruction on posture. I should really remind myself not to judge a book by its cover (nor its title). The same thing goes for DVDs!!"
1,"Holy cow, what a disaster!",The third time I used TheraBreath a horrible taste woke me out of a sound sleep. Now it is impossible to drink coffee due to putrid sourness. Only mints and highly acidic food are barely tolerable. Some say I can continue use when/if these side effects disappear. The intensity of this reaction has rendered me fearful of a possible upset to normal functioning.
3,Cute but not comfortable,"Ok, these shoes are really cute, they look great with skinny jeans and skirts, dresses, etc. However, they were not comfortable at all, I am pretty sure I will never wear them again. I wore them to a concert (where I was sitting) and I could hardly walk back to my car. In fact, I had to take them off. You have to have a high pain tolerance for these..."
5,Pleased with product,I purchased this dvd set as a gift for my mother. She is very happy with the product. It came quickly and in great condition.
4,frasier,An avid fan of frasier i have all 8 seasons as well as the finale and have watched them over and over . I think Frasier is probably the most intelligent comedy ever written . Although i think it has a lost a bit of spark since Daphne and Niles got together . But i still enjoy watching Frasier stuff up any situation he can still gives me a lot of enjoyment a good series .
4,User-friendly guide,"If you've wondered how old your home is, what it used to look like, if those stories you heard are true, this is the book for you. Start with any chapter that piques your interest -- you're sure to find useful tips and things you never thought of, like using a metal detector in your yard. I found many good strategies and I've been researching homes since 1995. Green explains sources of information and how to access them, nationwide. Her glossary explains in simple language the legal terms you're likely to encounter. An excellent general introduction to the topic."
3,Good comeback..,"This band issued a couple of great albums in the early 90's. They were named ""Shake Your Soul"" and ""Lights Out On The Playground"". This new album being a project between singer Kelly Keeling and Jack Ponti, is a solid melodic hard rock album, although it does not reach the heights of the former ones. The sound on this album is a bit rougher than the former. Highlights are ""Love By The Numbers"", ""Hands of Time"" and ""Victims of the Night"".All said and done, an adequate album from these boys, but they can do better.."
3,...a so and so comeback,when I first heard that Baton Rouge where going to realese a new album I was relly interested in seeing if time have made things better.but when i heard this album i only recognize B.R. from the voice and nothin else. The production is quite bad and the instruments really seem to be played from an other room....... not a bad album at all if you heard other rock album of that era bat a little more was possible.
3,eye of the beholder,"This book is a compendium of the information that Lefty Kreh has imparted by books and talks at angling shows over his career. Whether this book is useful to you depends on how many of his previous books you have purchased. Much of what appears in this book has been published in some form before. If you don't have any of Lefty's books, by all means get this one. If you have read one or more of his books, a lot of the information in this one will look familiar."
5,The Pentultimate Fly-Fishing Book!,"Every once in a while there is an expert who, through years of trial and error and effort-gains lots of knowledge about his area of interest- Such a man is Lefty Kreh- and then- sometimes he puts it all into one book-and makes it available to us neophytes-and WE WIN!Just such a book is this- whatever you need to know-flies, knots, tackle, methods, fish, water (Fresh-salt-warm-inland)-Hey , Lefty knows it- he puts it down! You get the book- you will know it too!"
2,dissapointed,"Based on other reviews I was expecting much more than I got. Ok,lets say, maybe it would be good for beginners, but as a mid level 3d artist I found it pretty much a worthless. The material consist of low tech Poser type scenes, with only a briefest overview of lighting, nothing about textures and surfaces, and the stuff on cameras is so basic one can figure it out with a month of Bryce use. Don't be fooled by the cover - this is strictly 101 stuff.BTW - I sent it back"
2,poor,"I bought this book in hope that I could improve my shots in 3d Animation but it couldn't teach me anything I didn't already know. I have worked in character animation for over 6 years and this book was way too basic for me. It might be ok for beginers but I am sure there would be better resourses out there. The book is thin and each chapter is very short, it was like reading a magazine. For those of you interested in improving your skills (which is what we constantly do in this industry) don't bother with this book.I am sure there is a better one out there."
1,Save your money,I was very disappointed in this book. It's short and does not offer any unique insight into digital directing. It's just another very average book on editing and cinematography. You would be btter off buying a real book on cinematography and directing.
1,unsuccesfully - unsatisfactory,"Only for begginers students, nothing worth on it , all the theory are base on previous books of cinematic concepts , about camera, editing , storyboard ,in general nothing more than old theory you can find on any other book about cinematography, even the oldest , the concepts involve on 3d topics are only little references on general aspects described on any 3D graphics software package manual . Very disapointedThis is only a copy about books of cinematography concepts with very poor 3D ilustrations."
3,could've been better.,"This DVD is a little disappointing in the fact that the interviews and commentary is limited to only a few individuals. Slade's imprint upon rock 'n roll is immense and this dvd just doesn't live up to the greatness that was Slade. Having said that, true Slade fans will appreciate some of the rare clips this dvd has."
5,"Beautiful, fun","This CD is wonderful. It has a beautiful combination or classical, modern trance/electronica with a little bit of a jazzy edge. It's very well put together and leaves you wanting more. I recommend this CD to just about anyone, you'll love it!"
3,Very soft but a little small,"These pillows match the Zany Black bed in a bag perfectly and they're very soft. The only thing I could complain about is that I expected them to be a little bigger. I did read the measurement in the description. Somehow 9x9 seemed larger on my tape measure that these pillows actually are! I may not have bought them if I'd seen them first, but my daughter is happy with them."
4,greek language,"Great way to learn. Thanks. It helped me for myths up coming visit from family coming to town. Wow, really easy and nice you can play im the car."
2,Great for Oral Learning Only,I believe that a traveler needs to be able to read the signs and the language. I have learned other languages and actually already has some experience with Biblical Greek. I did not realize that there would be no way to see the actual Greek script for the interchange. I believe this is an oversight. For me the material is useless since one of the things I wanted to do was to read the modern Greek and as well as speak it correctly.
2,"More LOUD than a power drill, literally.","When I first seen this product I got excited, but unfortunately it turned out to be nothing but a big disappointment.I bought this grill inflator to use on a wood burning stove in my home.I figured it would work similar if not better than a wood below, it does of course work, but the con's just out-way the pro's.pro's-It blows a nice steady stream of air.con's-This thing is ridiculously loud, even if you barely spin it at all, and trust me you don't want to spin it quickly, when spun at a decent pace the loudness can literally and accurately be compared to a power drill.The plastic tips... why would you put plastic tips on any device that is used for fires.. epic fail________________________It probably is suitable for outdoor bbq use, but I would not recommend this to anyone for frequent indoor woodstove use. If I was to use this product at night even for a split second it would wake everyone in my home and probably the neighbors too."
3,Really Noisy!,"You get what you pay for, so with this you get a noisy little device with fairly poor airflow, but if you crank very hard and don't expect a lot out of it, it is fine. I am now looking for a traditional bellows to get more air with less noise."
2,"Cheap, loud and flimsy!",My title says it all... broke pretty easily and was pretty loud when cracking her up till that handle broke off.
1,As an inflator? Maybe. As a bellows? Zero value,"This seems like one of those ""wait, we'll double the shipment and halve the cost"" kind of items, except before they quadruple the value. As a bellows/grill-blower, the value is zero. I could seriously move more air for less effort flapping my hands or waving a magazine. It went from the box, to the grill, to the trash can in 5 minutes. Your mileage may vary."
3,Great for starting fires,"I bought the older version of these, and it worked great for many years. They are inexpensive and they are cheaply made. I would gladly pay more money for a better built version. With that said, this newer version appears to be better build than the old one. I've never used this for inflating anything."
3,AIR GRILL INFLATOR,"This is not the one you want if you are starting fires with it. It's noisy and wimpy on air flow. Go with the Air Grill Blower. It is cheaper, quieter, and moves about twice as much air per crank."
4,Good documentry.,"Two documentries on one DVD.The Cult documentry maybe old footage, however it provides good information exposing the cults & their false doctrines. Testimonies from Ex-Cultists.The Occult documentry, also old footage, are people involed in darknessand worship the devil (only recommend Christians who are very strongin the faith to watch dvd WITH others).Good dvd for Apologetists."
5,This book is a dream come true!,"Finally, a dream book that is useful! Suz Andreasen has once again proved that spiritual and creative potential is for everyone. This book showed me the power of my dreams and how they can work for me. As an artist, I found it enlightening, powerful, and down to earth. The dictionary is handy and filled with universal symbolism from every culture and religion. It's a book that anyone can pick up and not only read, but also go back to again and again. I highly recommend it."
2,Shipping very expensive,For the size of this item the shipping was way overpriced. I will not order from this company again.
3,"Probably good, if you don't know IPA","If you are familiar with the International Phonetic Alphabet, this is not the book for you. The ""phonetic"" spellings used in the book are just confusing, and seemingly pointless, as there is an extensive explanation of IPA in the back of the book, albeit with unintelligibly written symbols.The book is also difficult to find in combination with the two cassette tapes that go with it, and without them, the book is rather useless. The cassette tapes are where the real information lies, and the book is merely a companion with explanations of how to use the tapes and transcripts of the conversations and monologues as heard on the tapes.I say, save your money. Rent a video with your preferred dialect instead."
3,outsiders view,A scholarly account weakened by its overwhelming dependence on outside sources and old views. Recent advances in American Indian studies would suggest this should have been a better work.
4,bonsai book Art of the Chrysanthemum,It is a very interesting book on the art of growing chrysanthemums. The user should take some items with a grain of salt because they reflect bonsai thinking of a few decades ago; grwoing mixes. And of course the book reflects growing conditions as would be found in Japan.
1,They've ReMastered or Something,"I'm acknowledging that there are working DVDs now shipping 6/08That wasn't the case back in MaySomeone that thought they knew how to edit Video tried making a DVD.The reason none of them will play is that the files are not named correctly.If you waste the time it takes to transfer the files to your hard drive and rename them you discover that the encoding is substandard with audio jump cuts, pixelization , flaring.""This item was a not-for-profit project created at The Art Institute of California-Orange County by staff and students. ""The Students should be either be failed or taught how to burn the project to viewable DVDs.The staff who allowed the unfinished project files to get copied to DVD media and sold to an unsuspecting public should be fired."
1,Read Reviews Before Purchase!,"I'll start with the Positives:1. Good DVD cover2. Nice looking girl interviewer.3. It includes Ray Harryhausen.4. Topic is KONG!Negitives:1. It should state in KONG sized letters ""STUDENT PROJECT""2. Poor Lighting.3. Male interviewer dressed inappropriately.4. Price should be $0.00-$3.00."
4,Perfect Balance,"The Cassidy James series strikes a perfect balance between mystery, adventure, romance, humor, human insight, and back to nature. Such delightful writing and quirky characters is rare. Read one and get hooked and you'll be reading them all. I'm not a rabid fan of the genre but I love Kate Calloway."
1,This won't get you through the PTO exam,"I created this course in 1995 and it was state of the art then. However, there have been so many changes in rules and procedures since then that this course is hopelessly outdated. I am launching a new course and you passthepatentbar.com has a lot of materials about the exam as it exists today."
1,Doesn't fit extended cab Ranger,"I was disappointed to find this part didn't fit my truck. I ordered it based on the drop down menus on the amazon sales page, with the final statement telling me it would work. The part is nearly identical to the original fuel pump with one major difference: the assembly that is inserted into the tank is rotated so that the pump will not sit flush, preventing installation of the locking nut. I have photos that show the differences. I returned the pump and am waiting for my refund, but this was a giant hassle that could have easily been prevented on the seller's end."
1,12 year old out dated book,"Do not recommend buying, black and white old, old pictures, unless you feel like taking out a chain saw (or axe) and using antique tools to build one, forget this book."
4,"A lot of info, but not enough detail on working the logs","Appears that the authors tried to pack everything they could on the homebuilding process into one volume including details on mechanical and electrical systems. It ain't bad, but I was looking for more details on working the logs, cutting the notches. Less hand drawings and more pics of the crew detailing out the structure. I guess when they said ""complete"" in the title they tried to throw in a little bit of everything."
3,"As described,","As described, got excatly as pictured. Would buy again. What else need I say? I am well satisfied. It's a book"
2,Taste,I did not like the taste and consistency of this...reminded me of milk of magnesium. Too thick and leaves a bad taste...easier to take tablets rather than doctoring this...
2,hard to chug down,"none of the reviews or product info listed how much calcium in a dose, which is important to know. so the suggested dosing is 30ml (only 16 doses/bottle) and this contains only 1200mg of calcium. so a reasonable person should be drinking 10ml (2 teaspoons) 3 times a day to maximize the benefit. you body can only maximally absorb up to 500mg of calcium each time.for all of those that mix the 30ml with glass of milk? you're wasting all that calcium.and i don't understand why people said this is good tasting, it's so chalky & weird, i can't stand it.If you don't like swallowing the horse pills, try using chewables (tums, or that chocolate looking ones). or eat a yogurt.I got these for my kids since they are not a fan of milk, but I can't even swallow them, so won't put the kids thru this misery. I could only add this when making certain smoothies, and thinking of adding it into popsicles.for adults, i think it's a waste of money."
4,Good Calcium,"This calcium is very tasty and leads one to believe because of the liquid form and the few extra ingredients, that it may be superior. But who know for sure with calcium or any vitamin or mineral. Takes time to know how the body absorbs it and builds bone strength. Kind of expensive though."
4,A big difference,"A friend suggested I try Cal/Mag to relieve nighttime leg/foot cramps. I've been taking it for 4 months and haven't had any cramps. I also noticed something else, I am a diabetic and have toe tingling and for me after a few days of taking Cal/Mag my tingling stopped, for me anyway."
2,high quality but my teeth hate it,"Hi, I bought this because my doctor advise me and my daughter to take Cal, mag,zinc supplement. Plus, I was told that magnesium citrate is better absorbed by the body. Only problem I have is that after taking this my teeth felt super sensitive as if I ate lemons or vinegar. Might try taking it with a straw next time. Has anyone else experience this?"
4,Really Old School,"This book is not particularly useful except to see how things used to be. It is from 1943, a time when all track was hand laid and O Gauge was king. Turnouts were not automated and N Scale was not even conceived of.The basic principles remain the same but the way they are implemented has changed dramatically. What this book does give is a nice view of ""how it used to be"". For people who still use the larger scales, it can also provide some nice layout ideas as well.Buy it as a historical curiosity, not a reference."
4,...Much better than Season 5 was.,"After the let down that was Season 5, I was in two minds as to whether or not to buy Season 6, but to keep the whole set complete, I did. Well, Season 6 was much better! The episodes are more action orientated, and less of the eco-guf that dominated Season 5. However whilst this was a pretty good Season, there was no Jack Dalton in any of the episodes.All in all, I would give this Season 8/10 (4*)"
3,So-So Season,"My family loves and enjoys MacGyver so much. This season, however, was a rollercoaster ride of good and bad episodes. It seemed like every other episode was a save the environment episode and that it didn't stay true to what makes MacGyver such a classic and lovable tv show...MacGyverisms.Don't get me wrong; there were a number of great episodes. But the moments of constant we need to save this piece of land and oh, I hate my dad, but by the end of the episode it's all...I'm sorry you were just misunderstood... Some of it was too unrealistic and left me feeling unsatisfied.Perhaps after six seasons Macgyver has lost it's initial appeal for me or maybe the writers just wanted to make a political statement. Either way it was sometimes painful to watch some of the episodes in this season.Overall: If you're a MacGyver fan get this to complete your collection, but don't hold your breath."
4,Wonderful Addition to Arabic Works in English,"There are far too many works of Arabic literature which have not yet been translated into English. Thus it is wonderful to see another epic become available to those of us who cannot read Arab (or Turkish... or Persian...). Lena Jayussi has done a splendid job with the translation, crafting an enjoyable read. Sayf Ben Dhi Yazan's adventures will delight all who enjoy folktales or medieval epic tales (although one does wonder why medieval heroes were so uniformly stupid!)."
4,Good stuff,"A little over the top, but definitely worth your listen. I jam this cd out regularly. Not bad from a somewhat newer and now defunct band. Think TEN YARD FIGHT. Straight up good."
5,Great pouch,"These bags are a must have for an electrician. I keep a few of everything in there, and it usually works out to save me trips out to the van. I keep it in my veto pro pac at all times."
2,Sub par quality,"I bought two packs of these for a tool kit for work. The quality is definitely lacking. They seem robust enough to handle sharp tools like screwdrivers being tossed around in them, but the zippers are very stiff to open and close to the point that i am afraid i am going to rip the pull tag off of it. Sometime i have to use pliars to get the zippers closed. Also, the bags are not the same size, i have some tools that will fit in one bag with room to spare and wont fit in others if I expect to close it. They seem to hold up to airline check luggage handling though if they are inside of a decent case."
3,Zippers Sticking,"For a brand new product, you would expect the zippers to work smoothly. Unfortunately, they do not and the bags are difficult to open and close. On the plus side, the quality of the canvas seems fine."
2,I am not happy with this product.,The zippers a cheep and are hard to open and close.I am looking for some other tool bags with better zippers.
5,tool bag,The canvas bags work great for keeping my tools organized and separate from the other contents of my checked baggage when travelling between jobs.
5,Excelent,I'm a field service tech and these bags are perfect for organizing all my tools. This way I can carry everything I need in a small bag. Different colors help when looking for a specific tool. Very sturdy made. The zippers are a little rough in the beginning but after a few months become much smoother. Will last for years to come.
5,Organized my traveling IT bag,"I had lots of tools in a large tool bag and took a long time to find what I needed. I have since put separate items in a different colored bag. Like CCTV bag, networking bag, testing bag etc.Works great, I grab the blue bag when ever I need x.They are very strong to I have a sheet rock knife in one and it hasnt punched through."
2,Zippers don't work smoothly,I was disappointed with how difficult it is to operate the zippers. The zippers appear to be heavy duty brass but it takes a lot of force to open and close them. It might be because the teeth don't line up very well. It is the same for all four bags. Maybe some light wax or silicone lubricant on the zippers would help. Overall I think they are a bit over priced for what they are.
5,ANOTHER QUALITY KLEIN PRODUCT,"These top quality canvas storage bags are ideal for transporting tools, accessories,or small parts. They are made of tough canvas, with a brass zipper which also has angood sized handle. I am using all four of these bags within my tool box, and I findtheir quality hard to beat. Looking for quality? Choose Klein."
3,"Nice Bags, Suspect Zippers",Not sure why but the zipper on each bag gets caught pretty much every time I open or close bag. It works but it takes more time and strength than it should.
3,"Some interesting parts, too much blah...","I am a big fan of historical mysteries, and had high hopes of one involving Poe. I found myself losing interest frequently throughout the novel. Other times, I just was confused. In the end, I just didn't really care what happened. Not horrible, but not worth the price, especially for a hardcover."
3,"90% is 4 star, the end is 1 star","While the book is well written and at times exciting, the ending was so disappointing that the time spent was not worthwhile. It is as if the author found something better to do when almost finished, wandered off, and then came back and tacked on a quick ending and a moronic epilogue attempting to explain why the book ends in ""mid-sentence"". An unpardonable crime, authors with a good story that they just don't know how to finish."
5,good LAX book,"My son really enjoyed this book. As a lacrosse player, he was excited to see how the game was played centuries ago."
2,Good orienteering but outdated,"After Chris Cassone ran an orienteering activity for my son's school, I thought this might be a lot of fun. Unfortunately the map is outdated. We started at the SW corner of Central Park only to find the arch name removed and Tavern on the Green shut down and no longer maintained (it may reopen partially/fully in the future). At that point, after two fails, the kids lost interest. I'm guessing there would be better luck with finding items like permanent statues, the zoo, etc. The orienteering part of the map is great if that's what you're interested in.Also, Amazon sent me one that was marked...either used or written on by someone there."
5,Updates,"The map you get has my corrections on it. The Greystoke Arch is no longer labeled and therefore very frustrating for those hunting for the answer. The Tavern cut down those wonderful topiaries, so I wrote in the answer here as well. Then there were two original mistakes on #7 and #8. They each had one-too-many dashes.As far as the map being outdated, I protest. The map is so accurate and the Central Park Conservancy NEVER changes anything. They might put up a kiosk here or there, or even a temporary fence because they are seeding a lawn. But the map is PERFECT for the game of orienteering, which my treasure hunt is."
1,Why is the picture showing the 24 pack?????,"Misleading. The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21. Beware of misleading listings.Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor. Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale. This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes. Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others. I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 24)"
2,expander track set,i like this product because of the extra tracks. I needed them to add something different beside the oval it was going in. what i didn't like was the piers.. the piers were plastic and some of them didn't fit the track properly.
5,station to fish house,The product was great. One thing I did was turn the train station into a crab/fish processing business for my harbour which incorporates a model of the F/V Northwestern. It turned out great
4,Wonderful Children's Classic,"Reading this book hot on the tail of Tolstoy and the Purple Chair was just a confirmation of the magical pleasure that can be found in books. One minute, I can be sitting with Nina Sankovitch in her smelly purple chair, thinking deep thoughts about the meaning of life and the things that give it substance, and the next I can be snooping around Mr. Bean's farmyard with Freddy, Jinx the Cat and Mrs. Wiggins the cow, taking down Simon and his evil gang of rats and foiling burglars that knit their own mufflers! I may never have kids of my own to share these stories with, as my dad shared them with me, but I'll certainly be reading them to my nephews and nieces, as soon as they come along! Walter Brooks was a master of children's fiction and the Freddy books could certainly be called great literature, as I came to define it based on Sankovitch's book, for they hold gems of truth about life and humanity, hidden beneath humor, adorable characters and entertaining plots!"
5,Always Gets His Animal,"You are going to love finding out who killed the crow, who stole the model train, and how Freddy rids the barn of those nasty rats. And Freddy makes us feel pity for those who need to be sent to jail. Whether assembling clues, shadowing the suspicious, or selecting a judge, Freddy is the right pig for the job. And you'll hardly recognize our old friend in his disguises."
5,Freddy is back!,"Oh my god! Freddy is back! I haven't seen Freddy and his pals on the Bean farm for three decades, but I and my school friends literally lived off of the delightful series. Sherlock Holmes meets Doctor Dolittle meets Clyde Beatty meets Dorthy Parker meets Nick and Nora Charles. Mystery, adventure, travel, humor, philosophy, wit, relationships, courage, duty, loyalty, persistence, valor, loads of imagination and fun, fun, fun! Enjoy! -- Robert Boyle"
3,Kitty finds just ok,"My cat can only eat grain free cat treats, due to digestive system problems. These treats are not his favorite but he will eat them. He prefers Snack 21's other dried fish, herring is his favorite. They are good for cats with sensitive stomachs since they are pure fish. It certaintly wouldn't hurt to try the Pacific Whiting flavor, maybe your cat will love it."
2,Hated it,"This is the worst book I've read so far today. If you're wasting your time reading this, you'll love it. Tanks"
1,Shipping disasters,"The box of 12 (plastic) bottles of Rinse Aid came with about a third of the bottles leaking/damaged, apparently from either poor packaging, packing or shipment. A replacement order was fulfilled swiftly at no cost (other than my trip to the post office), but seepage all over the packing box, as well as the outer Amazon box, once again forced a return for which I'm seeking a refund."
5,Highly Recommended!,"I am a busy woman and yet I have to serve top quality and delicious meals that take little time to prepare. Well, this rice with roasted chicken meal is one of my secrets in the kitchen. It is organic, takes a few minutes to prepare in the microwave and I haven't head anything less than ""it's great"". The quantity is significant so one purchase lasts for a long time. I am very, very pleased with it and high recommend it."
2,"seems like a good product, the sprinkle cap falls off though","This seems like a good product, but the sprinkle cap that comes with it does not fit it and falls off and then you get a big dose of the seeds in your recipe, instead of a sprinkle. The other thing I had a problem with was that I only intended to buy one jar of these and they sent two, but charged me for two for some reason, not sure why. The product seems fine, may be a little pricy though, I am sure you can find it cheaper elsewhere."
5,Great little VPN firewall/router,"Works great for setup VPNs between branch offices.Make sure to download the latest firmware 1.1_15, which is very stable. It is under the Netgear support site.(Older firmware does not work well).I have VOIP, file sharing, printer sharing, NFS mounting, email sending/receiving, all through this little VPN firewall. With latest firmware, it is very reliable.This VPN router also has stateful packet inspection firewall, showing in its log that daily blocked many hackers. Great buy from Amazon!"
2,Not Dave's Best,"Dave has great chops as usual and assembles some great players, but the result is disappointing due to the the also-ran compositions. They are simply unmemorable and formulaic compared with his other material. Synergy or Masterplan are much, much better albums than this.Frank Gambale does his signature amazing guitar solos (and they are amazing!) but they sound out of context with the rest of the band. I would much, much rather listen to Buzzy Feiten's funky quirky style - seems to suit Dave much better."
1,This is a Mess,Peter Gallagher is a Broadway veteran with several wonderful broadway soundtracks under his belt (i.e. Guys and Dolls). He has a great voice but I don't know what he did to his voice when he was recording these songs because they are just terrible and it doesn't even sound like him. Save your money and buy Guys and Dolls instead.
2,FWIW - Dualdisc DVD,"Just so you know this dualdisc just has the cd side in ""enhanced stereo"" on the DVD side so it's not really anything special. The reason for the rating..."
3,Joke,I bought this CD as a joke but he can sing well.Although his songs are slightly corny and overrated it's still a fun buy. But not worth $11. Before I purchased it or $5 so I'd see if I could buy from a FYE or another cheaper CD store.
2,Porter should be better served,"This is an el cheapo tribute to Porter. Clips are not always in the best condition. It looks as if none were restored with modern techniques. Biography is skeletal. Narration is boring. Some portions are introduced with intertitles. If you have seen ""the Great train Robbery"" you do not need to see this."
3,Eight Pieces of Brocade,A very interesting presentation of one approach to QiGong. A good addition to a student of the art's library. Well written and easy to follow with an abundance of clear pictures.
3,Not well filmed,"I have no expertise with which to judge the way the exercises are presented, but I do feel it wasn't filmed well. It was hard sometimes to see just what he was doing; sometimes his hands were out of view above his head or behind his back."
2,Could you explain that again?,"This would be a great book if someone who knew nothing about qigong had proof read it. As it is, there are big gaps in the instructions. Yang assumes you know things that you might not. The solution is to buy the video that goes with it (and Dr. Yang suggests that you do), or just buy a different book -- one that explains things well enough so that you don't need a video."
3,Time for a change,The scale isn't accurate. It changes every time you step on the scale. If you move a little it'll show an error. This scale is the first scale where you have a choice in your weight.
3,The Braided Rug,"Although this book is very attractive, I was disappointed, as I often am with ""how to"" books, in that the authors are so expert and know their subject so well they cannot or do not put themselves in the position of the neophyte. If you already know how to create a braided rug but need more expert guidance, this is a good book for you. Otherwise, it is too difficult.The Braided Rug Book: Creating Your Own American Folk Art"
4,GOOD BOOK,This book really helped me correct some of my trouble spots I had with my braiding. And has some really neat ideas for future projects. Easy to understand and follow.
5,Rag Rugs,Easy to understand instructions for the beginner & lots of picture illustrations make this a great craft book to own. Would love to have suppliers listed for Australia
4,Les Daniels knows his Superman Stuff!,"Les Daniels did a wonderful job compiling photos and information concerning the Man of Steel. I have been a big Superman collector for 20 years and know a great deal about Superman's history. Daniels told Superman's history in an easy to understand way, with a thorough look into Superman's changes from 1938 to the present day. The only thing that I was disappointed in was that it was somewhat skimpy on information, especially concerning the character outside of the comics. I would like to have seen more details than was written. But overall, it is an excellent read, especially for anyone who really knows little about the history of America's greatest fictional Super hero!"
3,Superman: The Complete History,"Superman:The Complete History is most recent history book of Supes,so it covers many more events in the man of steel's history than ever before,but it does not have in-depth coverage of the events in Superman's history.The book has 5 chapters,each consisting of many Superman events, which is a mistake.Each chapter should feature a detailed commentary of an event in Superman's life,rather than each chapter being many brief flurries of comments on multiple subjects.I don't think Daniels should express his opinion so strongly on some things, but he is a superb writer who is obviously a giant Superman fan,and anybody who likes Superman is a friend of mine."
3,A little too short,This book is great and it has a lot of info on the Man of Steel but it is just too short. It is worth buying if you love Superman though.
5,A fun read.,Most coffee table books are browsed. This book is probably too small to be considered in that category and definitely was not a book just to be browsed. I found myself reading it from cover to covers over the span of a few days. It is not only a visually attractive book but also just a plain good read. A definite recommended buy.
3,Not Bad,I like the sound of Carlos Santana's guitar unfortunate he's no blues player not next to Buddy Guy one of my favorites anyway it wasn't as good as I believe it to be but don't regret buying it so in my opinion is worth watching 3 and a half out of 5 stars .
2,notice,"Notice the reviewer that writes 5 stars, only has this dvd period, no other reviews, and the on that gave it less has 4 pages, that says plenty, seems this site is full of sellers who want to start up one time reviews of 5 stars, what else could it mean.I love Buddy Guy, but just another wierd deal where they dont release good stuff from the old days, you know its around. release some blistering on fire blues , old stuff, now"
3,Tones that touch,"3 1/2File under Corea's signature mellow progressive mixed with late-era genuine fusion, and as with many of the endlessly creative pianist's recordings one receives stunning output tempered with stubborn compositional intellect."
4,"first set broke, hoping for better on second","I wanted to listen to my mp3 music as I fell asleep at night, so got this set for one reason...the auto on/off feature. It was suppose to automatically turn on/off when your player turns on/off. My set does turn on, but it won't turn off. When the player turns off, a bright green light on the speakers stays on and a slight hum is heard. This is enough to wake me and I then have to manually turn the speakers off. I'm returning this set and asking for a replacement, as I really do like the speakers sound and size and would love to have this feature working. If the feature worked on this set, I'd give these 5 stars, as it does not, I'm knocking one star off and hoping that next set will be a full 5 star set of speakers."
4,Very good product for the price,"I hooked up these portable Sony speakers to my PC, and they are much better than your average PC speaker. I don't know that I'd want them as part of my stereo set up, as there isnt' enough base, but for how I'm using them and what I paid, I'm very pleased. They also look attractive.The only drawback is the size. They are about a third bigger than I'd like them to be. I have the room on my desk, so it's not a big deal, but they're definately bigger than most PC speakers."
4,Pretty good,"I bought these to hook up to my laptop on my desk. The sound quality isn't the best (there's a slight echo-y sound), but they're still pretty good for the price."
3,Not as portable as you would think,I bought this for my mother last year.I was hoping that she could use it on her laptop or MP3 player. It was not as portable as my parents would have liked. Not only that through my own fault of not reading all the product specifications I realized after we got the product that these HAVE to be plugged in to an electrical outlet. I assumed due to the portable aspect that you would only have to plug them into the headphone jack. That was MY mistake.The product with some types of music seem to have some type of background interference. It is more noticeable with some variety of musics.So if you are looking to use these outside while you work or something like that and you do not have an electrical outlet handy then you might want to skip over these.My mom went ahead and bought herself a Music Bullet which is portable but has to have the battery charged through a USB.Music BulletTM
3,OK - but not awesome,The sound is ok - They are very light weight. A little thin sounding - but ok. They do not get that loud. but they are ok
3,Radio Interference,"These speakers are not suitable for attaching to a tuner since they cause radio interference w/ AM reception. Even after moving the speakers away from the tuner (and away from the antenna), I was still unable to mitigate the interference. I did not encounter any problems w/ FM reception. It's possible that the power supply that came w/ the speakers is the cause of the interference and that simply replacing the power supply may correct the interference (not sure).With the limited amount of listening I've done on FM I can say that they provide a good reproduction of music or at least music that doesn't have too much bass."
5,A Compelling Story,"""The Leopard's Call"" incorporates humor, romance, drama, action, adventure, and a sense of the importance of family and community into a vivid portrayal of frontier life in rural India. The well-paced plot is entertaining and compelling, offering a wide variety of experiences that depict the remarkable courage, dedication, adaptability, and optimism of these pioneers in education."
5,Ginuwine - Back II Basics,Ginuwine's music cd called Back II Basics is great. Ginuwine sings well on this music cd. The Back II Basics music cd by Ginuwine has good music and song lyrics. I really enjoy Ginuwine's music cd - Back II Basics!
5,Stop hating !,"F*ck you haters this album is the bom, all you people want to see is that he team up with Timbaland again that is why yall people don't want to like this album and do like G is the worst but he ain't. He called this album not for nothing back 2 da basics not because he went back to Timbaland to make only songs togheter with him again, he created something that gives you the same feeling again that you had when you listened to his music this album got not one difference type of song but three Betta half, I'm in love and Take change the best you can get from G so stop hating on him."
2,Has he lost the groove? Slipping a bit here..,"A very talented singer, entertainer and composer but here is not one that I can push to others...he floats around on styles and does not stay true to what has made him a star."
4,It really a good smooth cd,I love this cd. All of the slow except when we make love and midtempo songs were very good. He didn't over sing on any of the tracks as he has in the past. If you take off the club tracks this album can be listen too start to finish. I really loved this album and felt he should have chosen I'm in love as first single and not when we make love. That the only slow song he could have left off. Please don't hesitate to buy this album.
2,And He Was Runnin Around Promoting This Mess,For what? You need to love it or leave it alone. I hope his singles and his album flop. You dont mess with my money honey. I cannot believe I actually felt bad for him because his song wasnt doing good. Ginuwine you let me down big time and I dunno when I can forgive you. This could of been gas money or anything.
1,NO STARS,Just to let people know that #12--Far Away is a jacked beat from an up & coming R&B; artist.What Ginuwine did to that beat was utterley disgusting. He and his whole team should be embarrassed. That's what happens when you you drop to the bottom--You resort to thievery.The original will be out soon and I guarantee that everyone will agree to the aforementioned.Hey CONGRATS to yet another Ginuwine flop.....
3,I't s cool,"I like Number 10,11.5 has grew on me.Number 8 is still growing on me.and oh girl is nice.And I like how he is giving new artists a chance on his Cd.Go Ginuwine!But go get Timbaland and missy and playa.You guys all need each other.Three more singles off the album,11,10 and 2. And have all off them with heavy dancing. You can aford it remember you got 8 million tuck away."
2,What happened to my BABY???,"Ginuwine, ginuwine, ginuwine. I expected better. It's not that the songs are bad, but there is clearly a difference in his passion as compared to other albums. As I listened, I did not get the sense that he was feeling what he was saying. (Trust me I know my G!) The song ""Back to Basics"" --- horrible.My favorites:4. When We Make Love10. Glaze in My Eye --- Love it!11. I'm In Love12. Far AwayAnd why does ""Take a Chance"" sound like Tyrese's ""How You Gonna Act Like That?"" I am so very disappointed. Come back G!"
2,Where's the G in Ginuwine?,"I'm sorry to say that this album is not worth $15. It lacks featured artists which can break an album. Plus, the songs are no different from each other. I don't think Ginuwine spent enough time on this album. He must've been in a rush to release it to really focus on the lyrics. And whatever happened to Timbaland?"
1,WORST STINGS EVER,I have been playing guitar 10 years and mandolin for 5. In my time playing mandolin I have never settled on a brand of strings that I love. I bought these because of the reputation of Ernie Ball. Boy was I wrong. One of the strings was defective. Two more broke while getting the strings in tune. I've only had that happen one other time and that was a set of Ernie Ball guitar strings. I've used dozens of brands of strings but never felt so let down with such low quality as these. My advice go with D'Addario or Martin. I've used both for mandolin and had no complaints. My complaint isn't as much with the defective string because that happens occasionally. But having two strings break while getting them in tune? That shows a serious lack of quality.
4,Great Album But something is definately Missing.,"I love This cd, I think that it has a lot of great music on it. It is missing the essential musicians touch. It is missing the real kick that keeps someone tuned in to a cd. Sometimes while listening you will find yourself tuned out. Other than that this is an unbelievable catch on anyone's hook. If your looking for an awesome sample listen to -- Attack of killer 20 pound pizza"
4,I liked it,"Simply put, I have respect for the man. Why? Because he did something totally different than anyone was expecting. It wasn't a bunch of flashy drum stuff, it showed his compisitional side and how much he enjoys things that don't require a lot of drums. It was different, but great anyway."
5,Awesome! Really Wild Stuff!,"Vinnie has always been an inspiration to me, so I decided to buy his album. It was great! He has some really wacked out fusion! Buy this!! Especially if you're a fan of Vinnie or just Jazz Fusion!!"
4,Last of the Mega Fauna,"An amazing story and an amazing book. A fantastic history of this last of the mega fauna of the pleistocene. The conservation issues are handled with skill and care. The whole history of the destruction of the native wildlife in California is reason enough to read this book. Nielsen weaves a wonderful story combined with a genuine love and respect for the animal. Was the money spent to save this bird worth it? Of course. We waste money on many things (tanks, bombers, drones, McDonalds) so any amount of money to save a relic of the pleistocene is worth it.As of May 2012, there are 405 Condors left: 226 in the wild and 179 in captivity. May their numbers increase!"
5,23 Great Songs on 2 CD's,"Had I known back in the 80's that there would be a Judds Reunion CD I could have saved a TON of dough on their CD's...The Reunion CD is like the Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2 together. I don't think I've even listend to any of my other Judds CD's since I bought this one, so many excellent songs on just two CD's.If you don't have a Judd's collection that this is the one to start with, if you already have a collection, well, it isn't complete without this one!"
3,"Not too many good examples, but a decent reference",I would agree this is more of a reference for the seasoned XPath/XSLT programmer. I'm a intermediate java programmer with some decent background in xml. I haven't really been able to get that much from this book in the way of examples. It's very light on examples.
4,Good Reference Book,"This is a good reference book, but is not a good start for developers who want to get familiarized with XSLT and XPATH. this book helped me to find what I was looking for and was unable to find in other resources including MSDN which has the worst documentation when it comes to XSL in general and XSLT and XPATH syntax in particular.On major drawback is that this book doesn't provide the user with complicated examples that utilizes different XPath functions.If you want a single reference book this is your book."
5,Great Intro,"If you're not a programmer, this is a great book to give you some strong skills with a very versatile and useful technology."
4,This does Kickbutt!!!!,"I wasnt expecting to love this DVD but I do. It is like they took the old Firm workouts and kicked them up a knotch. With Push Pull I was sweating big time and when Heidi Tanner said heavy weights I was using 15 pound dumbbells. My only complaint on Push Pull was that the kickboxing cardio sections where not really challenging. However, once Heidi took back over my heart rate was back up. As for Steamin Cardio, I didnt think it flowed together as well as Push Pull. It wasnt until the handstands and hover squats or maybe 15 minutes into it did it seem to mesh. Heidi is usually awesome when it come to queing but in this one it is best to watch first and then do. But even with these setbacks it still was a challenging workout. I was sweating buckets with my light weights. This is well worth the price!!!"
2,Very Disappointing,I have been a fan of Firm workouts for a long time. This one does not measure up. Maybe it's a good work out for people just getting started with physical activity. Not enough intensity for a good cardio workout and not enough weight work for a good resistance program.
5,Fantastic,This was a fantastic video describing historic black coaches in college basketball. Current coaches would do well to view and have their players view this film. These great coaches paved the way for modern African American coaches who are not limited to just a few schools because of their race.
4,Black Magic,"This is an excellent film, but the second DVD is redundant and adds very little. This film should be on one DVD at perhaps a slightly loewer price."
5,Outstanding,"I recently saw this ESPN production via video tape that I received from a friend of mine. This film recounts the history of small, black college basketball. Let me first say that I am a white middle aged conservative from the south and I would say anyone who is a college basketball and/or a history fan would be absolutely thrilled w/ this film. All the familiar names are there, Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Charles Oakley, etc that fans may know came from these type of schools but the best parts are the names and stories of guys we've never heard of. They are truly uplifting and at times tragic stories. I was raised in Durham, NC and am (I thought) very knowledgeable of area basketball history but had never heard of John McClendon, arguably one of the leading pioneers in the game. The film also examines a lot of the social and political problems of the 40's,50's and beyond in regards to race and discrimination. This is, in a word, wonderful television. I would highly recommend this purchase."
3,"Great movie, awful transfer","""Sisters or the Balance of Happiness"" is a beautiful movie by Margarethe von Trotta, one of her best. A marvellous cast and a poignant, beautifully told story.Unfortunately, the DVD is a mere, sloppy VHS transfer with washed-out colours and hard-coded subtitles."
5,First Anime Movie ever,At last a re-vamped version of Katsushiro Otomo's Fantastic Movie. With all the movie re-mastered. This is the best version of the movie I've ever seen. All the visual noise has been wiped clean and the sound is perfect.This Is a much awaited sci-fi release and it is up to the expectations I had.
1,akira on blu-ray,this is really disappointing they did not specify that u could not play this disc on us blu ray players so i spent this money on a useless dvd and cant return it bc i opened it. if thats so they should have warned buyers so im really upset with product.i would rate this a -100 they should specify. rarewaves is who i purchased the movie from and would not recomend getn anything from them.sincerely pissed off customer
2,While it's nice to see this on DVD,"This version has a completely different dialogue. I didn't see a difference in the movie animation itself, however if you're a die-hard fan of the original video release. This is a little off putting, because it's like a thesaurus exploded in the script. It kind of gave me a headache and I had to turn it off."
3,This isn't as great as proclaimed,"Ok, I've seen this movie, and countless other Anime out there. I've noticed people really cling to this film for reasons I think I might understand. For one, alot of people new to the Anime genre are recommended this film first, so they'll love this movie the best no matter what else you show them, they started with it. The animation is yes, very good for it's time. The story was gripping and the violence was decent. However don't run around saying this movie was the best. Somebody here said, ""The best animation they ever saw."" or something around that text, and if that's the case, stop watching this film 5 times a day and buy something else, because their are films out there now that people don't bother to even look at that make this film look sorry."
1,Why does everyon like this so much?,"I am getting really tired of people telling me that Akira is ""the best anime ever"". I saw this film for the first time years ago and think that it is one of the worst I've seen. The characters don't develop, the plot runs in circles, and the action sequences are so contrived and cliche they are mostly ridiculous. It felt like I was sitting in the back of a cab in Manhattan rush hour with a driver who doesn't speak English: You just don't know where in the world it's going, or why.If you want to watch good anime sci-fi, save your money for Neon Genesis Evangelion, Wicked City, or Trigun. If you just want good anime period, go for Ninja Scroll or Princess Mononoke, maybe Samurai-X. For those that love Akira, I just don't get it."
3,So...I don't see what the fuss is about,"I consider myself a big fan of anime, but...I must say I didn't like this DVD very much. I really liked Princess Mononokee and the such but this one was just hard to follow. Ok so a kid has super telekenetic powers and can blow junk up and i know he loses control of his powers but...whats the point of the severe case of elephantitis?(or hemerhoids if thats how u spell it)I really liked the fight scenes tho and thats why I gave it a 3."
1,New Script Ruined The Finest Movie Ever,"For this DVD edition, the producers decided to not only redub the film, but also rewrite the script. So any dialog or plotline that is inferred by the original script is actually spelled out for you. And thenew voices make it sound like a Disney movie. I love this movie, but it is unwatchable with the revisions. I hope to return it and find a copy with the old script. So disappointing. (as an added beef, why didn't they put both dubs on the same dvd? there are few added features, so there is sure to be plenty of free space on the disc)."
5,Quite possibly the best ever,"I am a die-hard anime fan. 'Akira' is the best anime I've ever seen. Better than 'Neon Genesis Evangelion', better than 'Tenkuu no Escaflowne', etc. The best way to see it is on DVD, all of the extra goodies... and besides, at most places you pay the same amount for just the subtitled version on vhs. Trust me people, if you're an anime fan, or a fan of animation in general, you'll love this. And even if you hate the plot, you can just stare at the beatuful artwork. And if you like live action, and think cartoons are 'made for kids', watch this and see just how wrong you are."
3,"another example of a ""enhanced"" version that deosn't compare to original",I'll keep this short and sweet I have only found 2 film whose 'Special Edition' or 'Director's cut' was actually better than ther original Aliens and Terminator 2- other than that they have each diminished the original. I feel this new translation of Akira falls in step with the masses. While the original version of Akira is one of my all time favourite movies this new signature series leaves much to be desired. The new transaltion deviates wildly from the original I have on Laserdisc and in my opinion weakens the story quite a bit. the voice actors don't seem to have the same energy as the original. Now I don't speak Japanese but eve the subtitled transaltions is slightly different. I'm not thrilled withit but Like star wars if you want it on DVD it is the only game in town
2,THE SPECIAL EDITION AKIRA DVD,THE REASON I GAVE THIS DVD 2 STARS WAS BECAUSE OF THE BOUNUS MATERIAL ON THE SECOND DISC THAT COMES WITH IT. DONT GET ME WRONG I'M A BIG AKIRA FAN BUT THE NEW ENGLISH VOICE OVERS TOTALLY RUINED THE MOVIE. THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE AND THE NEW VOICES DO NOT MATCH THE CHARACTERS AT ALL. MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS BUY THE FIRST DVD THAT CAME OUT...I WISH I HAD.
2,Depressing...,Have you ever noticed how nobody in anime stories ever wins? Especially not the good guys. Massively depressing with a sound trak that is so ominous that it alone is enough to make you double your Prozac.
3,I'm Lost?,The beginning is quite a visual treat. The characters(at least) a majority of them actually look Japanese. The film doesn't make sense towards the end. It's kinda weird. I don't like films I can't interpret. I like conclusive endings with some a assurance of an ending or sequel. The withered children give me the creeps. I thought the boy was a zombie. At first I thought Akira was some movie about some brats altered by nuclear destruction. That boy did look like a monstrosity. But it is a nice change of pace. I just wish the plot was more clear.It reminded me of some films I saw involving world devastation. But it's alright.
2,Manga is better,"Unfortunately, I decided to read the manga before watching the movie. Although, the movie does get a lot of the main scenes and events right from the original manga, the story was completely butchered. Akira is a 5 book series spanning 1500 pages. There was absolutely no way to make it into a movie and keep it accurate.A lot of these reviewers complain about the voice-over acting being redone and I have to agree with them although I haven't heard the original. A lot of the time, the voice acting just doesn't set the tone for the insanity that's going on. You find yourself not caring much for the characters because of this."
3,"Weak Story, But Good Animation","I didn't enjoy Akira as much as I expected--it's one of those films that gets sillier and more preposterous every minute, and not in an ironic, funny way--but I would still recommend it to fans ofThe Matrix(it explores some of the same themes) or of anime generally. Although the premise and the plot wore thin after a while, the animation is excellent and the English dubbing is also quite good."
5,One of the best anime movies ever!!!,"When I first saw this movie, I stopped watching about halfway through because I was tired. Once I returned it to the video store, I could never find it there again. They got rid of it. For quite a long time I have been looking for this movie. Then I finally found it at suncost video. When I watched it, I thought it was the best movie ever. You have to see it!!!"
5,Simply the best!,Akira is revolutionary. This is the film that got me into Japenese animation. Highly recommended.
3,"Nice Picture,Bad Voices","Waiting all these years for Akira to get rereleased was a pain,but when they give it to us....they kill it. The picture is amazing,it has never looked so sharp...But these voices lack so much emotion its not even funny..and my 3 fav lines were cut!! - ""Nice ridein' Tetsuo"" and ""Scum Bag!"" ""How about we get lost and have a few laughs...If Pioneer really cared,they would have given us the option of wich English Dub we want..this one lacks emotion. I want the original!!"
5,Akira is a must watch anime classic,"it your into anime, and haven't watched this film yet, you must check it out!!!! akira is a total classic, and is really well made with awesome graphics. you will not be disapointed with this film!! :)"
5,gets down,The art in this movie is amazing. The story is amazing. It just gets down throughout the whole movie! It is definitely worth buying.
5,Must See Anime,"I've always loved this movie and now I can watch it whenever I feel like it. The images are bright and crisp, audio is GREAT!"
5,Just a prediction!,I have to admit that I'd NEVER seen this movie before and I feel sad for this reason.If you haven't seen this animated movie you can't consider yourself as an anime fan.Even though I hadn't seen it I know it would be a blast in DVD and I'm going to buy it for sure.I hope that you feel just as I do.
3,the book is better,"The first time I watched this movie when I was a kid it scared the hell out of me. I found the Japanese comic (I know that's not the right word for it), and it had so much more to it. I wish the movie would have followed it better. I don't want to spoil the movie for people who haven't watched it, but there is one part near the end of the movie when he finds akira that I can't stand."
3,On DVD,"It's great to see this movie on DVD, it's one of my favorite Anime movies, first I had it on VHS and I found it exciting,also the score of the movies it's exciting. But this DVD special edition is not why I was expecting for: they changed dialogues and sometimes they make the story confusing. Maybe, new scenes included? The image it's clear and the animation good, the only problem are those moments inside of the bubble, when you see images of Tetsuo and his friends, and it's not clear what Akira is and he's the risponsable, of such disaster in 1988.If you really like Anime this is your movie."
2,"DTS Rocks, But Why On A Separate Disc?","A DTS version of Akira was what SHOULD have been on the special edition in the first place! This is a total marketing gimmick from Pioneer. The Japanese Region 2 DTS edition came with all the extras of the special edition, for a limited time until switching to only 1 disc. The DTS track blows away the original stereo, but is it really worth buying the entire movie again? If only they put together a mail-in rebate it would have been worth the money. Collectors only."
5,a masterpiece,this was a great movie. it made you think and want to become an anime charector. when it was over you just keep craving more.
4,favorite animated movie by Jonathan Lerner,I thought akira was a stange yet awsome movie. The gore was very realistic and the sound was great but the music stunk. The story was creative and interesting.It's a close compitition with ninja scroll but akira is my favorite animated movie.
4,An Incredible and Powerful Film,"AKIRA: this is the second best manga ever, falling just short of the incredible ghost in the shell, which is one of my favourite movies of all time, let alone animes. Akira is a definate purchase for anyone who can enjoy manga. The style of drawing on the characters is a little strange in the first 5 minutes, but after that you begin to question all other manga styles, as it looks great. Im not going to even start on the story, which is complex and intelligent, thick with symbolism and thought-provoking concepts.The music is classy, and fits the film perfectly. EG The amazing Tetsuo theme, brings the power and suspense of the films climax to your ears.This DVD is must purchase for any manga fan or anyone who has not seen this film. It also is a perfect starting place for anyone looking to get into anime/manga. (Beware the disturbing ending!)"
3,New Voices = Bad Acting!,"I decided to start with the 2nd disc because it seemed to have the most material on it. It took me about 3 days; on and off to pretty much see everything the disc had to offer. That alone makes this DVD truly worth the purchase. Unfortunately, they descided to mess around with the the movie; (disc 1). Big mistake! The audio was superb but, the new voice-overs had me screaming at the TV., ""If it's not broken, then don't fix it""! I found the new voice ""actors"" to be EXTREMELY irritating and without NY. style accents. They were able to successfully suck the energy out of the film. Over all, the movie looks the crispiest it's ever been. I strongly suggest if you've never seen Akira before to pick it up. For the rest of us, whether you get it for the interviews, story boards, and trailers on disc 2 or just as a great collectors purchase, be forewarned, and please for your own sanity, turn ON the subtitles."
4,Akira (4.1 stars),"?Akira? is considered by most to be the masterpiece of Anime films. Made in 1988 it is a landmark film, both by the many great animated sequences and the detailed story. The film is rather graphic, but not many Anime films aren?t. While the film is groundbreaking for both animation and film, it is marred by over length. The animation to me, seems a little more ?cartoonish,? than films such as ?Perfect Blue? or ?Ghost in the Shell.? In a way it really doesn?t hurt it, since the film acts as a very eccentric, exaggerated science fiction film. Also the film was made in 1988, the 80s where a much different time than the 90s. Since then the animation has matured, and things are looking more realistic. But without classic 80s Anime films such as ""Akira,"" ""Vampire Hunter D"" and ""Wicked City,"" the Anime industry may be lost."
3,"Greatest movie, lame new voices","I love this movie, I have loved it for years. When I bought a new DVD of it I was totally turned off to it. If anyone has seen the original movie with the original American voices then you will not like this new version. The new voices are horrible compaired to the original ones. While I do love this movie and always will I guess I will just have to watch it on VHS until sombody gets it right and puts the old voices onto the DVD."
3,A decent movie I just don't see what all the hype is about!,I have seen this film about 5 or 6 times now and it was the first Anime film I ever saw as it is for many. The animation is superb and quality of the voice acting is also great. I thought the world was very well done and the characters were intriguing. Unfortunately the film is just weird. I love intelligent films that make you think but this one just didn't seem to have much of a point at all. I know many people think they get it but a casual viewer will be baffled. Now most anime is extremely hard to figure out but I have had much better luck with films like Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll. This film was a groudbreaker in America and started all the hype around foreign Anime so it should not be missed but I just don't buy all the hype that it is the greatest Anime ever made. There are so many better Anime films you can find if you know were to look.
2,A boring movie,"After starting to view anime's (mainly manga) over the years i came across what is hailed to be the most classic anime of all, Akira. I must be the only one in the world that was bored as hell during this movie. The plot was excellent though i didn't really like the characters at all. The bull-headed Tetsuo is a stupid character with no real depth apart from his hatred. The action(yeah right) scenes were boring and dull to the point where i was falling asleep. Overall i must say that there are much better movies out there (ie. Ninja Scrolls which kicks [butt],Ghost in the shell, Samurai X) that people should own before buying the dullest movie EVER"
1,This movie sucks,"Its animated well. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Too bad the plot isn't worth the paper it was written on. I love Anime, but if the Japanese want to make any money in America, they need to give us poor stupid Americans what we want: A good, well explained plot, and a satisfying ending. That's all we want, besides violence, and sexually explicit nudity (which was not in Akira). Don't get the wrong idea, there was plenty of violence, and nudity is well... that was a joke we don't NEED nudity.... Anyway, if you want some good Anime, (for plot AND animation) check out Vampire Hunter D, Demon City Shinjuku, Record of Lodoss War, of the Venus Wars. Akira made me sick."
2,"All the hype, nothing on the delivery...","Won't go into lengthy description (plenty of other reviews for that), but as someone admittedly new to anime, I was told that I HAD TO see Akira (and read numerous reviews that said the same). I was very anxious to watch it, but found it to be anything but what the reviews said. I have chalked it up to one of those films that is a classic because everybody says it is because everybody says it is because everybody says it is..."
2,"as far as anime goes, not too bad","the animation is excellent, and if you're an anime fan then do it. this is the beethoven of anime, but anime in itself doesn't have a lot to offer. if i had to recommend one anime movie though, it would be akira"
1,New Sound Effects Not too great,I am an old time fan of Akira. I bought this DVD with high exceptions. I just want to put out to the fans that are thinking of buying the DVD to please reconsider. The original sound effects and the old voices are gone. Some company takes pride with ruining the movie's original sound English translation. Shame on them for retranslating the movies and stripping all the cool sounds. Like when number 26 (I think that is the little guy's name) is moaning and the windows break out of the building. In this new version most of the coolest sound effects are gone. I couldn't even finish watching it because the movie is ruined. The picture and the plot are still the same.... But the sound stinks. The VHS version is better for the old time fans.
2,English mockery,"I have to agree with all the other reviewers out there that said the english dub is horribly ridiculous. I've seen the old version and it is absolutely incredible! Which is why I reserved my copy of the special edition as soon as I could. But as soon as i started to watch it, it became obvious the second rate job done on the dub. Honestly, I hate it and probably will never watch it again. However, returning it isn't an option because it would cost more to return it then the cost of the movie. So it will probably just sit and collect dust. On the upside though, the extras are fantastic, and the video clean up is also excellent. This would have gotten 0 stars if it weren't for the upside. All in all if you've seen the original, don't bother with this version."
2,The New Dubbing is horrible,"I cannot express how disappointed I am with this new release of the Anime classic Akira. The new overdub is exceptionally bad. Even the Japanese overdub has been changed and is equally awful. The original dialogue was edgy and dangerous, whereas this new dialogue is vanilla and overly PC and wordy. I have been a major fan of this film, but I will look for one of the original versions to add to my collection. They also altered the amazing musical score. Cutting it short in some places and fading it out to a background noise in others, terrible. The original was a 5 star all the way, this ranks only 2. I couldn't have told you dubbing would make such a difference, now I know the truth."
5,Akira better the second time around,"The first thing anyone who has seen this movie before will notice is it has been re-dubbed. Most people say that it is not as good as the original...however, pronounciation of the charachters names is more accurate as well as the fact that there was a more direct translation of lines. Also if anime holds any importance to you as an enthusiast, you would be watching it in the (audibly) unchanged subtitled version. Picture is clearer, sound is refined and every aspect has been remastered. Once the best Anime movie always the best."
3,New english translation is too American,"I grew up on the (VHS) original english translation and this new one, takes away from the overall effect and the storyline. It's Japanese in origin. Keep those flavors in. Don't Americanize it to death.The dialogue sounds so cheezy in this latest version. If you never seen this before, and want the DVD, that's fine. But if you have seen the original english translation in VHS and were looking to the same on DVD, you may be disappointed.Plus, I understand the plot maybe because I've watched it too many times. This is still the best anime of all time."
3,despite the good reviews,"For some reason I didn't really like akira... I thought that the ending was WAY too strange, and that near the middle I wanted tetsu to die and go on so I could move on and do other stuff. I guess that I probably didn't get it -_-... Other than that the animation was great and the general layout was good, but I'm glad I rented it... Yet again, as someone else mentioned, if you didn't follow momento you probably won't get it..."
4,Nothing Compared to the Manga,"I saw this movie after I saw the parody video of Aqua's Barbie Girl, The ugly Girls of anime, So after I saw the movie, I saw in the credits based upon the graphic novel. So for the past 6 to 7 months i have shelled out 200$ for the 6 volume Manga. I compared the movie to the manga. The movie is only 35 to 40 % tops of the manga. Clown is a bigger character than Takashi. All in all, buy this movie and then buy the manga."
5,Anime masterpiece,"This landmark anime movie was awe-inspiring upon its release and is still fantastic a decade later.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. View this materpiece with an open mind. Akira tends to draw fanatics too bloodthirsty to appreciate its message while scaring away critics intelligent enough to understand it.A+, If I were to give this film a rating, based on four stars, I would give it twenty-seven."
1,Pioneer dub = Horrendous.,"I do not understand why on earth pioneer decided to ruin what was one of the most perfect animations ever. Some genius producer decided, hey, lets change the excellent original (orion/streamline) english voice actors and replace them with horrible new english voice actors.Of course, eventhough pioneer is not releasing this bluray, bandai in its infinite wisdom decided to use the pioneer dub as well..If you are a fan of the original VHS, do not, I repeat do NOT buy this bluray, they completely ruin the experience. Those great voice actors, and their catch phrases are no longer present.If you prefer listening in Japanese, as I do in for most anime (Akira obviously not included), then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise pull out the old vcr and pop in the original.. :)"
4,Bit Confusing but overall good,"Though Akira falls into the trappings of most anime (some far off crazy plot point that is never explained but is supposed to have a ""deep"" meaning) it doesnt take itself sooooo seriously that it turns into awful mush. Akira handles the mysterious parts of the story in a way that you feel you've gotten enough to understand the goings on, unlike that horrible princess mononoke which some people have the audacity to say is better than Akira. This film is classic because it takes the best of japanese animation without making it too confusing and warped to understand."
3,"Good, But Confusing","I had just become a fan of anime and liked a couple of anime shows. After doing a bit of research on anime it seemed everyone loved ""Akira"". I found the movie confusing at some parts and they should have explained things better. The ending really confused me. I also think there could have been character development and it could provided more information about the characters. However the animation was great and so was the music and some parts of the story rocked."
3,I love Akira....but not the dvd version,I love Akira...it was the second anime I ever saw and was just so awesome to see. I had bought a VHS copy a long time ago and it was just my prized position. When the dvd came out I was like this is a must have!!! I got it and saw they had revised a few things...some good...but one thing really bothers me imparticular is the fact that someone in their greatest of wisdom decided to change the original dialouge and the original voice actors...what the crap? Alot of great lines are taken out and replaced with very cheesy ones. I was to say the least sad. So everytime I introduce a friend to Akira I whip out the VHS version...hehehe
5,AKIRA!!!,"This movie is a must-see for any anime fan. It's as simple as that. The makers of Akira were ahead of their time. Akira inspired and influenced many other films. It's the movie that brought anime to the US. It is a wonderful classic. However, I will say, if you have read the print version, expect changes as you would any time a story's format changes. Even if some viewers end up disliking it, Akira is a film all anime fans should experience."
3,Why Akira is so-so as a movie,"As one of the first anime movies I saw, I can say I was at first in awe, then dumbfounded by Akira. It's really one of those movies that teeters between brilliance and failure. Many who get confused will probably give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's brilliant. Or maybe I'm a little more cynical than most.Anyhow, this movie is like 20 lbs of manga (comic books) condensed into two hours of film. Do you really think they will pull off a coherent story? To their credit, I don't think you could distill 20 lbs of manga into a better movie. Unless, of course, you broke it up and fleshed it out a bit like they should have done.If you decide to delve into this movie, I highly recommend you pick up the manga (available here on amazon) and learn to love that first, then the movie second. It's all that's good about this movie, only made so you can understand it."
1,HELLO? THIS CARTOON IS AWFUL!,"I was thinking...hey...maybe everything will come together in the end. HA! This movie MAKES...NO...SENSE. Oh yeah, and its boring. You want good SF? Watch Blade Runner, Aliens, ANYTHING BESIDES AKIRA. You want good animation? Watch Prince of Egypt, Toy Story, ANYTHING BESIDES AKRIRA. If this is the best in anime (is that right...who cares?), then that is a genre I can do without."
1,Why change it?,"Myself and several of my friends love this film and were eagerly awaiting this collector version on DVD. As soon as the DVD began we knew something was wrong. They changed the English voices! When you have watched the original dubbed version many, many times you get to love those characters with those voices. Changing the voices is like destroying a work of art. Imagine if Disney redid Snow White and changed the voices? Imagine how stupid that would be. Well that's what you get here. A sad decision. I am selling my collector set and looking for the first DVD release with the original voices. Let me say, my friends and I were sadly disappointed. Bad job, bad disc."
1,This was once a fantastic film....,"But alas it is now naught but not good. They totally destroyed one of my favorite productions, as well as a great memory of my youth. The voice acting is horrible, and the whole plot was dulled for a general audience of us ""stupid Americans."" If you want this movie, try looking around for an older VHS copy. I just can't believe that they took out ""Bitchin'. I feel like I could take on the world today!"" and replaced it with something stupid like ""I have new amazing mental powers. Let me use them to mind wrastle with these blue childern who also have powers."" Okay, maybe not that bad, but pretty close."
1,WAY TOO OVERRATED,"i just finished watching it today, the whole day. i could not sit for 2 hours straight watchin this movie that most of the people say is sooo good. i HATE it. since everyone loves it so much i was expecting quality story like ghost in the shell or ninja scroll, but i got a stupid ""i donno what to call it"" that just draaaggsssssss on and on. and besides that, i hated the animation of the characters, it was ""dragonballzee"" which i think is cheap. the only thing i did like was the bike racing scenes with the nice light glow trails. on the last note...HORRIBLE MOVIE."
2,"Verry overrated, senseless story","This is by far the most overrated anime of all time not the best. The only reason everyone sweats this movie is because it has been labeled as a classic, people dont want to admit that they didnt like it because they think everyone will make fun of them. ex: You dont like Akira Oh my god thats the greatest anime of all time. Dont believe the hype its long, boring, and the plot makes absolutely no sense. I actually started falling asleep when I was watching this, yeah while I was watching the greatest anime ever, sure it is. Dont get me wrong the animation is top notch and the character designs are great, I just thought the story was poor. If you like Ghost in the Shell and Perfect Blue you will definately like this, if you like to understand the storyline when you are watching a movie then look elsewere."
1,rent it first!!,"Akira is somehow one of the most-hyped anime out there. I saw it a while back, and frankly, I hated it. It was long and boring with a twisting plot that led nowhere. The setting was believable, but the plot was not (this coming from someone who likes anime plots). This movie is also LOOONG. You sit through it for like 2 hours and then you think...""what a waste of time! I could've actually seen a good anime instead!"" My recommendation, rent it first, and if you love it, buy it."
2,Who had a problem with the old English Dubbing?,"I am really disappointed in this DVD. The sound effects and music where done great but the ""New"" dubbing I found lacking. First of all, this is a classic that has been around for over 10 years. They should have included an option to hear the dubbing we have all grown to know and love. The new dubbing isn't offal but I enjoy the original dubbing far better. If they already had the dubbing available, how hard could it have been to include a choice to hear that too? If you like Akira in original Japanese, then you should like this DVD but if you want to relive the movie you saw as a kid, try the VCD............."
5,GET THE NEW DTS VERSION!,"Everyone reading this review who has a DVD player that came with a Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1, 6.1 whatever Receiver built in that came with speakers, get this version and listen to the DTS Version and compare it to the Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation on the other releases. You will definitely like the DTS Version, I did very much. Now I have to go spend 20 more dollars on a new surround soundtrack so I can enjoy the movie more. I wish Pioneer would have done this in the first place and put both DTS and DD on one disc so we could enjoy the movie this way, oh well. Get this version!"
1,Pioneer dub stinks!,The only way to get the original streamline dub on DVD is by getting the Australian special edition DVD from madman. I just got it today and believe me it has the dub you want!
1,the blue ray won't play on my player or playstation,I think it is meant for European or Japanese blue ray players. I get it to work on my blue ray player or the playstation. I have not been able to watch it
5,Astounding,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Lush animation, intense story...All the qualaties a good movie needs. This is truly the god of anime and the only other anime films that stand up to it are Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke. In other words....BUY THIS NOW!!!"
2,WHY CHANGE THE ORIGINAL AUDIO!?!?!?!,"Akira has been my all time favorite movie for years. I felt like a kid at Christmas when I saw it FINALLY came out on DVD. Then the unfathomable happened. I noticed that this classic movie's entire audio track had been redone with new dialogue and new voice actors. All I can say is that I am heartbroken by this awful decision. While the visuals have been greatly improved on this DVD, I will prefer the old VHS version until the original audio is brought to DVD."
4,"""Pretty good Akira""","The picture quality is great, the dub is average, I missed the old voices, they had more individual character. ""New"" translation doesn't make it any easier to understand, it just makes the lines awkward. If you need to understand it, try reading the manga. Nice extras although my RCA dvd player doesn't like the ""Capsule"" option and restarts the DVD everytime I tried to get the movie to continue."
2,Great anime... lousy English,"I loved Akira when I saw it for the first time. I was amazed at the quality of the artistry, storyline... everything. When it was even remotely available on VHS, I started looking and eventually bought it. When the DVD came out, I was exstatic and bought it as soon as it was available. Unfortunately, I returned it the next day. The ""new"" english dub for the movie stinks. It sounds almost as if a group of fans got hold of the film and dubbed over it, using inferior equipment. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend this version of an awesome, genre-breaking anime."
5,A landmark in animation,Akira is not just an animated movie; it's a work of art and a work of love. It's a feature movie that just happens to be animated. The scope of its story is immense and the philosophical issues actually challenge the audience's intelligence in an age when everything is dumbed down for cheap laughs and comfortable feelings. Akira is truly a landmark.
4,Positive,"Got my product in a timely fashion no complaints. There were scuffs on the case but i was warned before hand about those. Great to work with and ,again, no complaints."
4,The way its ment to be seen,"Perfect transfer, wish i had seen it in cinema but this the closest it gets. I have an average av receiver and the sound is just incredible, what can i say, awesome picture quality for such an old movie and ubsolutely unreal sound. Recommended to every fan of animated movies on blu-ray. Oh, and there are no extras, very sad..."
2,"Great picture, lame English dub","Had a chance to look at this Blu-ray release of what is arguably the greatest Anime movie ever created. After the thoroughly disappointing Pioneer release on DVD, I was hoping somebody would have gotten a clue and included the original English audio track (as the Region 4 DVD release does).Alas, this version only provides the ""new"" English audio track -- the politically correct version made just for America. What's the point of having 50GB of room if you can't even include the original English track? I don't recommend this for anybody who really cares about the film. 5 stars for the improved picture, but minus 3 for the horrible ""new"" English audio track being the only option. Wanna produce dubs for repressed Americans? Then start making your own animated movies!"
1,Wish it was the original,Some of the voices have been redone and lines changed. I quit watching as soon as I noticed that it wasn't the original. My Blue-ray disc copy will become a Christmas present for family and my VHS copy just became more valuable to me.
3,Make sure its the correct version!,"This blue ray was much cheaper than others offering it, but it turns out that they did not put in the product description that this disc only plays in Region B blue ray players, which means it only plays in European systems, and not in America, where I am. So unfortunately I have to send it back!"
5,The King of Anime comes to UMD!,"one of the best titles of all time, akira is a tale of a gang of kids that get into trouble in a variety of ways and when tetsuo gets experimented on by the military, it seems he has developed some telepathic powers like the ability to move things with one's mind *telekenesis* Now they will need Akira to beat this menacing friend.can they beat tetsuo? will the military's laser satellite be able to kill him? find out by buy ing this spectacular film!5 Stars all the way!beautifully animated and excellent sound there are a variety of versions of this film and the umd version is excellent as well I would recommend the Special Edition (I have em both) for all the extras you could want. a superb film in every way.buy Akira Here! (UMD for PSP)Akira [UMD for PSP]and buy it on DVD here!Akira (Special Edition)"
1,This Dolby 5.1 Soundtrack sucks!,"I just rented the DTS version just to see the difference and I would have to say that the DTS version is much much better soundwise. But if you don't really care about surround sound, then pick up this Special Edition has great features and the movie sounds ALRIGHT on the DD version. But for all home theater folks who like this movie, get the DTS version. It is like the single disc DD version except with Japanese DTS 5.1 audio, English Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and the movie. But seriously I recommend the DTS version if you want to truly enjoy the movie!"
4,disapointment,being a big fan of this movie. I've been waiting for the dvd realease for like 3 years. this movie is THE anime moive! but I was disapointed with the dialogue much was changed from the original. they used new voice actors for the new version which I didn't mind so much but when your favorite lines come up and you say them then they say some thing completely different it bummed me out. but all in all this movie is a must have for all anime fans.
3,U.S. ruins Akira,"The movie Akira is awesome, at least the original (VHS) is. This review covers the DVD release of it, so if you dont know the movie, look for another review. I was very dissappointed by the DVD edition. While I do like the picture cleanup done for this release they totally ruined the audio. It is done in 5.1 (i'm not complaining about that), but I have several complaints: 1) the new voiceover is aweful in two regards: different dialog, in some cases it changes the whole meaning of the scene; and new voices (the tones) of certain characters just sound awful for the respective characters. 2) the music has been cut down! the music is a big part of this picture and in alot of places it has been remixed down to total silence (music) in quite a few scenes. because of this the whole mood of the movie has been cut downFor these reasons, I am keeping my VHS copy of Akira; the DVD just doesn't do it. They should have put it on dvd as is, it did not need new voiceovers."
3,not that great,"I don't know what all the fuss is about when it comes to this movie. It is so overrated, long and at some points very boring. And yes I am an anime fan but this just didn't work for me. When Tutsuo's body got huge and was ready to blow up that was when I thought the movie steered to far away from what the movie was supposed to be about. Very strange movie indeed. I recommend Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Cowboy Bebop The Movie and Ghost in the Shell over this movie."
3,Why Akira is so-so as a movie,"As one of the first anime movies I saw, I can say I was at first in awe, then dumbfounded by Akira. It's really one of those movies that teeters between brilliance and failure. Many who get confused will probably give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's brilliant. Or maybe I'm a little more cynical than most.Anyhow, this movie is like 20 lbs of manga (comic books) condensed into two hours of film. Do you really think they will pull off a coherent story? To their credit, I don't think you could distill 20 lbs of manga into a better movie. Unless, of course, you broke it up and fleshed it out a bit like they should have done.If you decide to delve into this movie, I highly recommend you pick up the manga and learn to love that first, then the movie second. It's all that's good about this movie, only made so you can understand it."
2,A butchering of a Classic!,"These ""people"" have destroyed a classic with the new English dub. Several catch lines from the movie have 'vanished, gone...without a trace' Just like that line from the movie. While the picture looks good and the sound is clear, the dialog ruins this movie. Anyone wanting this classic on DVD, unfortunately this is the only choice right now. Perhaps these morons at Pioneer will release the origional english dub on DVD.I am outraged as would any other fan of the origional."
1,ANOTHER DVD I'M STILL WAITING FOR!,Yeah... again I can't review what I DON'T HAVE! The delivery 'estimate date' is supposed to be tomorrow (Oct. 4th) but I don't think it's gonna happen somehow! I AM NOT A HAPPY BUNNY!
3,WHAT'S THE POINT?,"THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL, FIRST THERE GONNA DO ONE THING AND THEN TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER, MY HEAD WAS SPINNING, BUT I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD AND VIOLENCE THIS MOVIE HAD WAS UNBELEIVABLE IVE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH BLOOD IN A JAP ANIME CARTOON BEFORE IN MY LIFE, BUT IF YOU LIKE A MOVIE THAT HAS EXTREME VIOLENCE AND BLOOD AND DONT CARE WAT THE STORY IS ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT."
3,Interesting but...,"The previous reviewer has said it all. And I don't understand why it has become so famous. I met some artists years ago in the Metro and they mentioned about Akira and how they liked it and inspired by it. If you are in the Animation or Art field, you properly have heard of this. Don't you guys have enough? This one has been around for many years, dude!!!"
2,"Okay, not good, far from great....","I didn't see this movie until about 3 years or so ago, and I will be the first to tell you, OVERRATED! This movie did not live up to the hype that I was expecting. First off, the plot is good, but from about the middle on just was, for lack of a better word, wierd. I don't think this should be the first thing people think when they hear the word Anime. The ending is soo strange that I made the decision to not see this again. The characters were also odd. To say the least you can do a lot better when it comes to anime, try Cowboy Bebop if you want a great anime (the show or the movie, they're both great!). Yes, 2 stars, and I'm still hesitant to give it even that many."
1,Cartoon by any other name,"Although the only people who click through to this will be fans, so I'll be derided for all time, I have to say that there was a point in this film when I woke up and still wasn't interested.Remember Astro Boy? I do!"
5,One of the great Anime Classics is Back!,"When I saw this film for the first time, just a few months ago (that's months, not years), I thought it was incredible -- if confusing, due to the overload of compressing all of the story in just two hours. After a short while of having my brain go back to the events, I tried to get a copy of this film -- only to find that none were available. The film was no longer on the shelves. Now Akira is back, available to own! For those who know, GET IT! This is a landmark film."
3,An anime classic,"This classic anime film was released in 1988 and became a landmark in the genre. For its time, the animation was highly advanced. It was also one of the few productions done in Japan at the time using prescoring.This is a story that takes place in Neo Tokyo in 1988 (a new Tokyo that was built after Tokyo was destroyed by a mysterious explosion). In the course of this anime you see biker gangs and mutated children with precognitive abilities. And for good measure, there is a corrupt government and terrorist insurgents trying to destabilize the government.The story itself is interesting, but yet it is also on the strange side and a bit confusing. Ultimately, while this film is an anime classic, this is a film I probably wouldn't really give repeat viewings to."
1,Something lost in the translation,"I was excited when Akira came out on DVD. However, I was not prepared for what I was about to see. Having watched the ""ORIGINAL"" Akira on VHS, I was awaiting the digitally remastered and new English dialogue to be superb. Who's (...) idea was this? The new English dialogue lost EVERYTHING from the original Akira. I watched and listened to three different characters pronounce ""Akira"" three different ways, all incorrectly. The only part about the digitally remastering of this classic was that the colors appeared crisp and brighter accenting the fact that it is a well done anime.I was thoroughly disappointed in what Pioneer has done to a classic movie. I wasted money (...) for this awful version. I guess it just goes to show that you shouldn't mess with perfection."
1,Shame on Pioneer,"As previously mentioned the video quality is very impressive. My problem with this remake is with the english audio. New voice actors and dialog make this film unwatchable to me. This movie is a classic and has been around for nearly a decade. It is too late to change it now. Come, on how would you like it if the voice of Darth Vadar of Star Wars was changed? I applaud Pioneer to trying to update the film but at least include an audio track with the original voices/dialog. As it stands this movie is going back, I would rather watch my old worn out copy on VHS."
1,this version is thoroughly disappointing,"The original movie ""Akira"" that came out in the 80's is, in my opinion the greatest animated film ever created. It has so many things going for it. The animation is fantastic, along with great music and sound effects including a unique, gripping, action packed story line.My friend lost my tape of the original movie a couple of years ago, and when I saw the ""Special Edition"" DVD version of the movie, I was excited to say the least. I got home and watched the movie as soon as I could, and after the first 30 minutes, not only was I extremely disappointed, but I was upset. Whoever decided to re-dub this movie and change the sound is a complete idiot. The movie has lost all of the lines and sound effects that made the original tape so great. If you bought this movie originally on VHS more than 10 years ago, do not buy this version. You will be sorely disappointed, wishing you had the old version on VHS to watch."
2,Why,Why oh why did they think they needed to redo the english dubbing. now insted of they sounding like they look on the screen . they all sound like a bunch of first graders. although it still is watchable if you turn off the english and go with the subtitles
2,New Akira Sucks Buy the Old Akira instead.,"Although this new dvd may come in a special collectors case and look fancy it is a huge let down. The animation may look great but if you compare the voice acting of this Pioneer release to the good old Streamline Pictures 1988 release, the Streamline Pictures one blows this new one away. I miss the original Voice Actors of the English dub. The only way I could see if some one wants to buy this is for the Japanese Track. But if you buy it for the English track I suggest you find the old version it is 10 Times better. I give 5 Stars to the original version but only 2 to this one.."
2,Masterpiece? Not really....,"To be honest, I think this is seriously over-rated. Perhaps I just expected too much from it, but I didn't really enjoy it that much. Once I got into it I started to enjoy it, but I still wouldn't call it a masterpiece. The animation was good, as was the overall picture quality but I just couldn't see what the fuss was about. I'm just glad I didn't pay the extra for the Limited Edition Tin."
2,"Akira, not all it's cracked up to be","Ah yes, Akira. After many years of anime fandom and having watched great movies like Perfect Blue and Vampire Hunter D, I expected this acclaimed anime to be best I had ever seen. I read tons of reviews and decided it was time I watched it as well. I sat in anticipation in front of my computer as the opening credits ran. But when the ended, I wasn't surprised by the 80s animation (I experienced plenty of that with Vampire Hunter D). As the story progressed, I got attached to the characters and thought damn...WHEN DOES THIS END?!?! The movie drug on and on and was FAR too long. In the end, I felt like the writers just dragged out the plot for the animation (that isn't even really that great). In the end, I was left thinking, ""What the hell just happened?"" Oh well, I wasted 2 and a half or so of my life. At least now I know what everyone is talking about...I just don't idolize Akira like everyone else."
1,Translating shouldn't be this hard!!,"How is it possible to make two translations of the same darn script nearly unrecognizable? I don't know, but the people at Pioneer have managed to do that. Don't buy this DVD if you're hoping to get the same Akira that you've watched since 1988. It's not the same move AT ALL!!! The images are the same, the sound is WAY BETTER, but the voices, dialog and sentences are completely different with entirely new phrases, whole paragraphs missing, entire explanations dumbed down to Idiot American levels and, all in all, ruined.Yes, I'm outraged.Maybe, if enough people grumble about the massacre of a great classic Pioneer will re-re-release this DVD with the original dialogue, no matter if it's up to par with Dolby Digital standards or not.They've drained the blood from this great story. Buy this DVD and you buy a husk. A shell. A lump of skin with no guts. Welcome to junk."
2,New english dub with no option to hear the original? %$#%,ohhhh man. I'm getting scared. I've read two reviews that say the new english dub isn't as good as the original. My heart is filling with dread as I await it's release. Why oh why did they have to screw with a classic? This is like re-uniting with your long lost love and realizing she's got no teeth. I'll shell out my 30 bucks to own the dvd but damn... she ain't got no teeth! sob sob
5,This is what anime is meant to be!,"Many have said its over rated which may be true, HOWEVER its is still a must have for all anime fans. There isn't much of anything that I can say that hasn't been already, So I will simply say that it is a great movie that should be in every anime collection."
1,a waste of money,my kids (4 and 5 1/2) love mighty beans. and theyre pretty cheap so we started collecting them. for months i was searching for a mighty bean track and coulndt find one. people who worked in stores looked at me with a blank look on their faces....finally i found this 1 and my wife and i tried to put it together...its so flimsy that 1 touch knocks the track off of the holder (its not attached!). also the inclination isnt steep enough to let the beans go down the slope every time...just pretty much a waste of money
3,mightly beanz tin,The grandkids loved the tin and loved the race track within as well as the beanz. The tin is a good place to store more beanz and is also very attractive for their collection....will hold a LOT of beanz.
4,What we expected!,"My daughter, 6, had saved up her change and had wanted Mighty Beans for a long time, when she saw a knock off set at the dollar store, she bought them. They were such a disappointment to her- they did not have a bean inside, just hollow shells. I bought this set as a surprise to replace those and were not disappointed. She has been setting up different kinds of ramps and 'experimenting' to see what works and what makes them flip the best. They hold up well, and have kept her entertained. I have heard some say they are dumb, mindless toy, but I have to disagree- my daughter has spent quite a bit of time using her brain to figure out how steep of a ramp they can take before they just slide down, different things she can cover the ramp with to give them traction, and setting up ""race tracks"" for us to race them on. She has had a lot of fun with them, and has actually learned things without realizing it!"
3,Very good but could have been a monster,"First off, I have to agree with everyone that this band is best heard live. They have never produced a studio album that can compare with their live show. If you ever get the chance, go see them! That being said, this cd left me feeling somewhat confused. There is so much on here that could have put them over the top but for some reason it just didn't quite cut it. Listen to the ballad ""Sweet Orphan"". That song could have been a major hit but the vocals just don't fit the song. Then there is #7, N.O.T. (I Want My People Back). This song seems to be a rather poor attempt at a pop hit song and it fails miserably. The rest of the cd is very good and some of it borders on greatness! Calvin Crozier, Twelve, and Mother Mary are fantastic songs that belong in anyones Celtic library. One of these days this band will put out their magnum opus but this one, while somewhat close, is not it."
4,Gabby Gabreski,"Un très bon bouquin, très facile d'accès mme pour les non anglophiles, pas beaucoup de termes techniques ce qui facilité d'autant la compréhension. A l'inverse, j'ai trouvé que cet ouvrage manquait un peu d'anecdote."
4,Where are u ?,"I have bought this CD for 4 years and I think the songs are really nice. I have ever loved Mark Owen since Take That. But what is he doing now? I didn't hear anything anymore. It's a pity, because his voice is fantastic. If I were u, i would buy this CD!!"
3,Good first effort,This is good first effort as a solo artist. His voice lacks the confidence that his other albums display. Some great tracks. This is a must have for the ultimate fan.
3,The Lovely Mark Owen,"I bought this cd right when it came out. I was a HUGE Take That fan and was completely obsessed with Mark. (Silly Teenage Years). I think this album is good, but not as good as it could have been. I haven't heard any news about another album from him, though it would be nice!"
4,One of the best Cd's I have ever heard.,"I have been a Mark Owen fan, since he has been in the boygroup Take That. He is an awesome singer and his CD is just great.I wish he would make a new one, but fom what I have heard is not going to.That is too bad, cuz he is so good."
1,Misleading,"Online Picture was not what was sent - totally wrong and waste of my time. Shame on you. Very, very disappointed"
4,"Wrong size, but----","I was sent a 30 foot, not a 35 foot central vacuum hose. I don't knmow why I measured it, but I did!!I called Amazon customer service and was connected to the Phillippeans, where I had a ten minute conversation which was very difficult to understand, but I thought that the person told me that they could only deduct 20%, even though the 30 foot one was less than $40 and the 35 foot one was $61. I than emailed Amazon and they deducted an additional $9 and I kept the 30 foot one. I would have rather received the correct on, but my wife needed it immediately to clean the house!The only thing that I question is if it was sent on purpose assuming that most customers would not actually measure it. I'll never know.I buy ofter from Amazon and tow of the past three items have had problems. I wonder if their qulity control is losing it's normally high standards?"
3,Great single for collectors.,"The single for Adrian Belew's ""Pretty Pink Rose"", off of ""Young Lions"", is a worthwhile investment for any Belew collector.The song itself is presented in the same mix as is the album, but there's three b-sides. One is ""Oh Daddy"", straight off of ""Mr. Music Head"", but the other two, ""Neptune Pool"" and ""Shoe Salesman"", are unavailable elsewhere. The former is an instrumental in the fashion of the material on ""Desire Caught By the Tail""-- its very orchestral and works quite nicely, with some great clean tone guitar below occasional washes of synths from Belew's axe. ""Shoe Salesman"" is a great piece-- acoustic guitar and vocal and full of bizarrely bad puns in the lyrics that somehow work in that very Belewesque fashion (it also helps it ends in under two minutes)."
5,2 previously unreleased songs on this EP,Tracks:Pretty Pink Rose (w/ David Bowie)Neptune Pool (*)Shoe Salesman (*)Oh Daddy
5,Lot's of sparkle,I get more comments on this necklace than any other piece of jewelry i've ever worn.It looks like there are diamonds in it but just very sparkly!
4,Mom loves this story and wanted the book...,"Having recently seen the movie on TCM, my mom wanted to read the book. We got this version and she enjoyed it greatly.I can't comment on the story myself because I did not read it, but I did want to mention that this version has extremely tiny type and is not easy to read. Luckily my mom's vision is pretty good, but it took some effort to read."
3,Is this the same as the MACally Syncbox?,"Since there's no data on Amazon what this product does, here's a link to what may be the product data...http://www.macally.com/new/new_syncbox.html"
1,Dire !,I was unable to finish this though I managed to get most of the way through.I consider Strav. one of the most overrated composers of any century but I was prepared to give him a chance and see what he had to say. I wasted my time.There was no theme to his ramblings. I am not a big Wagtner fan but I disagreed with his comments. Most of what he said struck me as trite.Don't bother to read this - there are very few insights.
1,What the heck???,"Pros:- These are fruit snacks. They taste like fruit snacks. This is definitely a positive.Cons:- There's no reason to buy these fruit snacks over any other fruit snacks. You'd think they would be shaped like your favorite Simpsons characters, but NO! They're just shaped like fruits. Are they nicely detailed fruits? Sure. But that's not why I bought the SIMPSONS fruit snacks. If I had known they were just gonna be plain old shape I would've bought the other brand which I don't remember the name of but I know and trust.Oh by the way, writing a review about a fruit snack is the most ridiculous thing ever. I shouldn't have to ever do this, and that tells you how displeased I was with the product."
4,Rotozip ZWMET1 ATTACHMENT: POWERFUL BUT DELICATE,"Undoubtedly, This is the best device for making a fast metal cut. I used it for cutting a 1""x1"" 1/16"" thick iron angle and it was cutted well and fast, but the ZWMET1 disk got wasted, it reduced to 1/2 diameter, I suppose, because I did not use it in the right angle because The Zip Mate does not let You see the cutting line completely.The ZWMET1 is cheap and with practice, You'll make it work more efficiently that I did, so the first time, buy some of them !Bye."
2,um... not what I expected,More Kreskin than Hawking... now the review requires me to type more words. Unfortunately I can't come up with any to improve on my review.
3,OK,"OK movie, some parts are better than others Probably more interesting if you are ""newer"" to this type of subject."

2,Not Good Enough,"Coming from using the Electrasol Tabs, this detergent leaves many more bits of food stuck to the dishes and seems to be leaving my dishes looking visibly dirtier as time progresses. I find that to get the dishes to come out of the dishwasher looking anywhere close to clean, I have to pre-rinse them to nearly the point of hand-washing which, of course, defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher. Additionally, the increased hand-washing uses much more water which is not environmentally friendly. On the plus side, the scent is great."
2,To many suds,"We have soft water in our area and the dishwasher kept overflowing with suds from the Earth Friendly dishwasher gel, cut way back on the amount we put in and it still overflowed.I read about the different ways to cut back on suds, from using vinegar to cooking oil, but thought it was ridicules to have do this every time I wash dishes in the dishwasher.We have since switched over to Ecover dishwasher tablets and problem solved, and the dishes come out sparkling, clean & spotless."
1,Worst Natural Dish Detergent Ever!,"I have used a few different brands of natural dish detergent and had been happy with all of them until I tried this one. It simply does not wash my dishes. There is food stuck on everything, which is funny since I started scrubbing all the food off my dishes when I realized this stuff doesn't work. And no, it's not my dishwasher disbursing food, it's brand new, and awesome. Once I'm done with this stuff I will going back to my favorite brand of natural dish detergent, BioKleen, I highly recommend it."
1,Ecos dishwasher soap thumbs down,"I am all for using green products but this stuff does not do the job, I ran one load of dishes through twice, using hot water, there was food on the dishes and the glass pieces were cloudy. I emailed ECOS, they said I need to run vinegar through the dishwasher to change the PH, and then it will work but frankly that is just a little too much work. We also have hard water so maybe that is the issue The person from ECOS said that it works great for her with fine china, antique glass etc, but I guess I am just not willing to experiment, I just want clean dishes. Note, My appliance repair guy said to put a full glass of distilled vinegar upright in the dishwasher, after 10 or 15 times the deposits will go away and the glasses will not be cloudy. Don't put it in detergent dispenser, it will not work. Kind of off topic but thought I would mention it."
1,I wanted to keep buying it...,"...but I never will again. We practically prewash the dishes before we put them in the washer, and they still come out spotty, filmy, and powdery. (We only use the recommended amount - we're not overfilling).We also purchased their line of laundry detergent and are equally disappointed. Bummer!"
1,Nope!,"The price alone forced me to be diligent in at least giving it a fair shot. I scraped and rinsed every dish, used the ""pots & pans"" cycle...even tried running it twice (undoing the environmental benefit, I'm sure), to no avail. Cloudy, grimy dishes at the end. If you don't love finding what looks like bird poop adhered to the bottom of your wine glasses, buy another detergent that works."
5,Works great!,"Works amazingly well, clean and sparkly dishes and glasses every time. You only need to fill up the dishwasher cup 1/2 to 2/3rds on a full load!"
2,Turns a Dishwasher Into a Dish-rinser,"Bought this because my usual choice (Method Smarty Dish) was out of stock. Enormous waste of time and money.Any dish that isn't essentially hand-washed before going in the machine comes out dirty. The tiniest fleck of food will hold on to any surface and must be removed beforehand.The gel also appears to not rinse that cleanly, either. Pretty much everything you eat off of the dishes after using this stuff will taste of lavender. There are certainly worse aromas to have around your food, but I'd rather have none at all.Avoid."
1,"Awful excuse for ""dishwashing"" gel","Other reviews have commented about the ineffective nature of this product, but I feel compelled to add my thoughts. I've used several environmentally-friendly (at least purportedly) dishwasher detergents, and this is by far the absolute worst product I've encountered. It does, as they claim, clean tea and coffee stains. However, I can use baking soda and a little elbow grease to take care of those. What it doesn't do is clean dishes well. You could, of course, rinse dishes so that they're nearly spotless before placing them into the dishwasher, but that defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. Avoid this stuff completely, unless you enjoy wasting your money."
1,Terrible product,"I completely renovated my Kitchen less than a year ago and installed a quality integrated dishwasher. I've tried several dishwashing detergents and tried this a few months ago because I try to use environmentally friendly products. As soon as I switched to this product my dishes came out with food stuck on them, residue and feeling dirty. Not all dishes/glasses/silverware were unclean but I had to inspect and then re-wash a lot of dishes.Even after pre-rinsing, not overfilling the dishwasher and running the sink faucet on hot for 15 seconds to get the hot water immediately into the dishwasher this product still did not perform.I have never had a product that performed this poorly. Its not earth friendly because I have to waste more water when I re-wash the dishes this product didn't clean properly."
1,Worse than using nothing,"-Doesn't get the dishes clean. (And, I always rinse them before loading the dishwasher.)-Leaves a residue on the glasses.-Creates way too much suds, which do not drain well, and can damage the motor.OTOH...hmmm. there is no other hand. Terrible product. Plain hot water would probably work better."
2,removes coffee and tea stains?,"I just can't believe they state on the front label that this product removes coffee and tea stains! I had guests over, all of whom drink filter coffee, so out of 10 cups that I took out of the dishwasher after using this product, two of them went into the cupboard (they were probably the cups that I'd had my very weak tea in). The others I had to scrub because of the heavy coffee stains and put back in the dishwasher. I actually checked all the dishes to see if the dishwasher had actually been turned on they were so stained! Do not recommend this product and will not use it again."
4,Seems to work as well as cascade actionpacs,"I was hesitant, but as cascade were no longer making the fragrance free actionpacs, and because we don't really mind the smell of lavender (= like the smell really!), we gave it a try. We don't use too much in the Bosch that we have and stuff comes out as well as with the actionpacs.If I were to review the dishwasher, I might suggest that *it* doesn't work too well, but this product seems as good as anything else we've tried. It is certainly about a thousand times better than the Seventh Generation powder that we used for a while!"
2,Poor results,Dishes that would be spot clean prior to trying this product did not clean well. I wanted to do the right thing but no thanks. Going back to Cascade.
1,Don't waste your money,"This was on sale at my local high end grocery store so I bought 2 bottles. It's worthless. I might as well run my dishwasher with no detergent whatsoever. I can't count how many times I've had to rewash things by hand after ""washing"" them.I've followed the directions, use the hottest water setting, pre-rinsed, used a vinegar rinse, etc. Nothing will make this stuff work.Save your money and get a different product. You might as well put money in the detergent cup for as effective as this stuff is."
2,"Great for environment, smells good, doesn't work","This stuff is great for the environment and it smells great. BUT...even though I rinse my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher, this stuff just doesn't do the job getting them clean. My glasses are all cloudy. Overall, I want to do my part for the environment but I REALLY want clean dishes too. I have to get through this case and then I'll be looking for something that works better."
4,Works well for us!,"Because of the majority of the reviews published, I have been thru 2 bottles of this product now, which I bought at my local CoOp, and I have to say I like. It works well for me. My dishes are clean, no film (though I do use Ecover rinse aid). I do pre-rinse my dishes, but I don't, by any means, scrub them prior to putting them in the dishwasher. I have never over-flowed the washer with suds. I like the lavender smell that fills my kitchen and lingers, mildly, on my dishes for a brief period of time. I live in the SW part of the Country so maybe the hard water has something to do with the quality of cleanliness different people get from this product. If you can find it locally pick up a bottle and give it a try before buying a whole case. But for me, I really like it!"
1,Disappointed,"Without a doubt the most ineffective dishwasher detergnt I've ever used. I have a very good Bosch dishwasher and had no problems getting my dishes clean until I used this product. Every knife and cooking utensil has to be rewashed, regardless of how dirty it was to start with. Even butter knives are left with a scummy film. I don't see how this can be good for the environment if everything needs to be washed twice. Unfortunately, I bought it at Costco so I have to use up several bottles before I can go back to my old brand. Don't waste your money."
2,Water type makes a big difference,I've tried this and other earth friendly dishwasher products here in Nevada. Sadly the water here is pretty bad and I think that is a big reason behind the lack of performance in these products. To anyone looking for a dishwasher detergent that works I say tread carefully as it'll probably take you a few tries to find one that works and given the price of these products it's an expensive game. It's worth it when you find it though!
1,"Leaves tea stains, food, and white film on dishes","Unless you have extra time to inspect and re-clean all your dishes, don't buy this product. We gave it a try for three loads and each time found numerous dishes with food particles remaining, mugs left with tea stains, and even a white film left across plates. We tried increasing the amount and running the loads again, but the stains still persisted. We ended up needing to hand wash about 1/3 of our dishes. Considering all our extra water usage and extra time to get the dishes clean with Wave, we are immediately going back to conventional dishwashing gel, which always gets our dishes clean without pre-washing. We'll recycle the Wave plastic bottle, but sadly the contents are going down the drain. It's a shame that it's useless and actually created extra waste to buy it."
1,Can't put zero stars,"I made the mistake of buying two big bottles of this stuff at Costco. When I first used it I though the dishwasher was broken, washed dishes were gross. Lots of food residue, sometimes to the point that it looked like the dishwasher hadn't even cycled. Really nasty. Switched back to our normal brands and everything is fine. I'm going to see if Costco will refund the money on this and make sure they know it is a useless product."
1,It's awful!,I usually use the Seventh Generation stuff (which works well for me) but took a chance on this gel because it was a little cheaper. It is AWFUL! It leaves all of my dishes covered in specks of food. It's almost as if somehow this soap grinds up any food that's left on the dishes into a powder and fine mists it onto everything. I do use a separate rinse aid but that didn't help. I'm surprised with all the negative reviews this product has that it's still selling.
2,disappointing,"As a second generation Cuban, I tried earnestly to finish this book, but I found it disappointing. I wanted to learn more about the events taking place in the 50s and 60s in Cuba, but the book is wrapped up in love affairs and personal adventures of the author. Usually this is a good thing, as long as character development of the people involved cause me to feel somehow emotionally drawn to them. But that was not my experience. I've read all her other books, and Obejas is a great writer (I loved Ruins best), but this one came in for me as the least interesting."
1,Aweful,"Could not get past 150 pages. I suppose there is a story but I never found it. There did not seem to be any continuity, it was hard to get a feel for the characters because they were mentioned so infrequently.Most of the book was more like a history text than fiction."
2,My review,Digimon World starts as a good game but the longer you play it the more frustrating it gets. Having your digimon die one after another after putting all that work in to making them the ultimate fighting machine gets really old really fast. The gameplay is alright but the sound and visuls are not very good which brings this rating down a lot. The funning conversations and the battle tournaments are good but in the end they are not good enough to boast the rank higher.
5,I hate it when my digimon digivolves or mutates!!,"Firstly, my worst thing about digimon is digivoving. I can't believe the show is when they change back and we can't, fustrating isn't it?! I always wanted to keep Agumon, but hey we change how we look when we're about 25 or 34. That is how it goes in digimon aswell!!! Lastly, if you have a favourite digimon and you accidently let it poop! It will mutate into Numemon or Sukamon (bad digimon's), i always wanted my digimon to stay the same you know!!"
5,Digimon World five stars!,"For any digimon freak like me, this is one of the greatest RPG's ever made! It's alot better than DW2. Why? #1. Its graphics are phenomenal for a 32 bit system. #2. Its got battles, puzzles, secrets and like everyother game, cheat codes. #3. It works with most analog sticks. #4. I find it easy to save when someone tells me they want me off the playstation. I haven't stopped playing it since I got it."
4,digimon world,this game is so cool. I started out with augumon he is now metelgreymon. if your not a digimon fan and dont now the story and dont watch the show this game is for you because it lets you make the story and live freely.
4,11 year old gamer,"I thought that overall this game was good. Everything about it was cool (except the music, which tends to get on your nerves after a while). That is why I give it 4 Stars"
3,Virtual Pet,"This game is a modified virtual pet game with a few pokemon like tests. It barely follows the show if at all. However there is some redeeming qualities. Your Digimon will Digivolve. You start off with either Gabumon or Agumon and you can battle other Digimon. The two main objects that I know of in the game are to bring all Digimon that have ""lost their hearts"" (the equivalent to black gears in Season 1) back to the city and to fill up the Digimon Digivolutions Chart while your fillingup the city.As I said at the start, it's mainly a virtual pet with a twist. You do have to take care of you Digimon as you go through the game. The Digimon can get sick, will have to use the washroom, eat, will become tired out when you train the stats at the stat-boosting facilities in the outside training gyms, and ask to sleep (which can be done anywhere.The big reason of why I gave this game a three is all in all this game can drag on until you become good."
5,The Greastest Game Ever? DUH!,"This game is the best thing since sliced bread! I am partial to starting out with Tentomon. I am so proud of my HurculesKabuterimon! I wasn't that interested in Digimon. I mean I thought it was cool, but barely, and then this game flipped my world! You have to get this game! Tip: Wait a while after it comes out then grab it! Or go to your video game store early on Monday when they usually get new shipments!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Unlike the other reviews, i was very disappointed with the game. I was very excited the the game game out. Love the cartoon series. I made the mistake of purchasing it before testing it on a rental. I thought it moved too slowly and the battles with other digimon was unstimulating. The only good thing i can say about the game are the graphics are excellent and the sound FX are okay. Rent this game if you can before you purchase it - just in case you do'nt like it."
3,it's ok,"The game is ok long. Like pokemon, but better it's is way funner. Who is Hercules kabutermon is that the mega form of tentamon and how does he look. Reply if can."
3,"The Game is okay,but many MANY flaws make it a bad game","The game is alright,but many flaws make this just an average gameStory 3/10 No story at all.Just Recruit digimon to your city.All you basically have to do is beat a digimon sensless until he joins the city.Graphics 5/10 3-d characters in 3-d backgrounds,just average graphics.Not one of the games strong points.Sound 2/10 REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE thats all I can sayCharacters 2/10 They dont even do any thing! All they do is tell you usless information that you already know.For better characters in an RPG go to Final FantasyFun Factor 6/10 Despite the flaws this is a pretty fun game"
5,It's just the beggining,"This is the first Digimon Game to come out. Digimon World 2 and Digimon:Grand Prix is coming out soon too. Yo can start out with Agumon or Gabumon and Ultimate is the highest level in the game.Here is some rating about this game. Kind of game:Adventure/Role Play Sound rating:Very good It has a sense of cool sound in it.I'd rate it 4 stars. Graphics:Awesome I'd rate it 5 stars.All 3-d. Other: 4 and more You even get to help Drimogemon dig a tunnel! Everyne should like this game,non-digimon fans and family. Parents I got my game here It's great you probably couldn't imagine how fun it is."
5,Digimon rules,The game was great it high on color and so good I was play for hours. Buy This game Now!
4,surprising....,"usually i hate digimon games, but the digimon world 1,2 and 3 are excillent.Its still fun to play every once and a while. Out of all the digimon world games i feel this is the best of them all :D"
3,A fun game...but only for a little while,"I am a big fan of Digimon, so like most fans of the game I decided to pick up my own copy of Digimon World. The storyline is you are a boy who has been brought into the Digital World to help save it from disaster. You have to recruit Digimon and bring them back to the main city to maintain order in the Digital World. At the beginning of the game, it's a lot of fun, but soon the whole concept gets old. Most of the time all you do is train your Digimon to ultimate only to have it die a little while later. When your off to far away places, and there's no bathroom nearby your digimon goes to the bathroom wherever you're located. Overall this game's plot is very weak making it somewhat boring, and you'll probably get tired of it very easily."
2,I must be a Pokemon Fan..,"I just believe the game itself is [not good]. Sorry... But Pokemon is and always will be so much better. I am a mom of three, who sits and plays these things with her children, and I have yet to understand the hype. My opinion, before you spend the money on the game, rent it and have your kids try it out. The real thing may be that they are crazy about Digimon (cartoon), but the game is not as great. Pokemon Snap, and Pokemon Stadium still is the best."
2,Please Get This Game out of here,One word :( Maybe that wasnt a word but this game is terrible.I am writing about this game late but i just had to tell people.I have both Digimon World 1 & 2 and Digimon World 2 is much better.In Digimon World you have to answer 2 questions depending on which digimon you get:Agumon or Gabumon. Then you have no idea where you have to go unless you have the guide. Then in the middle of nowhere your digimon has to go to the bathroom.If he doesnt make it he goes on the floor and you virus bar goes up.Please dont get this game its standard is very low.Get Digimon World 2 its much better!
2,Not the greatest game.....,"Too many feedings and too many bathroom trips getsannoying fast.What did they put in the food-prunes?Whenon the training field,i often had to stop training just somy digimon could use the bathroom.Most of the time,my digimondidn't make it to the bathroom on time,resulting in a ratherunsightly little pile.Another gripe is that my digimonevolved into the practically useless Numemon 98%of thetime.I often let him get killed off until I got a digimonI liked.My advice is to rent this game."
1,ATTENTION ALL POKEMON MASTERS,"If you like this game, I would advise you to get Pokemon at least because this game [is bad]"
1,Not impressed....,I was not at all impressed with this game. It is just like the pokemon gameboy game but more boring.I would not spend my money on it!
1,IT SUCKS!!!!!!,THIS IS THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAYED!!!!! THERE'S ALMOST NUTHING TO DO IN THE WHOLE GAME!!! WENEVER I GOT IT TO DIGI-VOLV IT ALWAYS DIGI-VOLVED TO A LOW POWER DIGI-MON NEVER TO A DIGI-DESTEND DIGI-MOM PLEAS DO'NT WAIST YOU'R MONEY ON THIS GAME PLEAS!!
2,My Review,"GAMEPLAY 2/5You have to recruit Digimons to File City and it will take a damn long time. The part I hate most is the part where your Digimon die. Look at Digimon World 2! Does your Digimon die? And especially when you raised it until it got to the Ultimate level!BATTLE 2/5When battling, you have to press continously to let your Digimon fight and a fight gets so long. I just hate it.GRAPHICS 3/5Not bad, not good, just average.MUSIC 1/5Very irritating, escpecially when you're trying to concentrate on a boss fight."
5,TRUE DIGIMON WORLD FACTS,Some people say you can start out with Tentemon and some people say you can get MEGA digimon but you can't.The highest form you can get is an Ultamate.The starting digimon you can get in the begenging are Botamon-Koromon and Punimon-Tsunomon. Still the game is still so cool.You recrut digimon and Go to Mount Infinite and Fight Devimon and I think MetalGreymon and one more Digimon.If you recruted all the Digimon that you could and try Mount Infinite a second time you would be able to fight Machenedramon. he is very tough your first time fighting him your first time.your digimon live for 15-20 days depending on how you take care of it. after your digimon dies you will have more choises for starter digimon.
3,mainly for music industry types,"This book has a lot of interesting information, although it's not quite up to the standard of the Joel Whitburn books. More pictures of the artists would be welcome, as would less ""bubbling under"" references. Also, it's not necessary to say the person being interviewed told ""this author"" something. That's assumed, unless another source is mentioned. If you work in AC radio, as I do, this book is very helpful!"
5,Distinct vocal on a wavey background,"This L.P. has been hailed as the first Psychedelic record. You can try and add it to some specific genre, but this album is special. The weird Electric-jug sound, the great guitar work, the general energy flowing, and ofcourse Roky Erickson's lyrics and distinct vocal. The ""13th Floor Elevators"" cover of a Dylan classic, ""It's all over now, Baby Blue"", is brilliant. A must for all those who love basic, down-to-earth (or outer space) Rock Music."
5,60's Psychedelic Payload. Heavy Weather Here.,This is a recording that in my opinion should be in all serious collections. Probably the most fantastic Psych musicians of the 60's or any other decades since that period. Grab this one quick and crank it up. Relive the exciting 60's.
4,oscillator overload,"I agree with the other praise for this classic, but a word of warning: there is an oscillator effect on EVERY SONG! (With the exception of ""Baby Blue"", one of the high points.) It's interesting for the first couple minutes, then it will absolutely drive you up the wall if you are easily annoyed by persistent noises. Even on slower tempo songs, the oscillator is still there (only slower!). It's gratuitous, and tends to cheapen the music, but don't let that stop you from obtaining it. You'll get used to it."
1,Avoid this version of this recording! Buy the Spalax version instead!,"This is terrible recording of one of the greatest Psychedelic LPs ever made. The Spalax import release from France costs a few dollars more, but it is much better sounding. Leland Rodgers, the owner of International Artists label and the original recordings, somehow lost them in the late 1970's, and so the so-called ""Collectables"" label uses these awful 5th or 6th generation no-EQ'd tapes for their masters on ALL of their Elevators releases. They sound like Hell. Avoid them. Spend a couple extra bucks and buy the Spalax releases instead, if you're at all a discerning consumer, or, if you can, find the (believe it or not) superior 8-track tape mixes available in the trading circles, those have been reEQ'd and are 2 generations away from the master reels."
5,Easter Everywhere,"Further from the garage than their first record (Psychedelic Sounds of ...), this is more muscially strange (Earthquake), less frenetic (Pictures), less driving, less scary even, than the other record. It's gorgeous, mind-widening music, great rock and roll, and is as worth your time as any mid-60's Stones (and therefore, MORE worth your time than any 70's Stones, and by extension the rest). This record had no hit potential, but was more interesting and exciting than any except the best Dylan, Beatles, Love, etc., as on the edge as the Velvet Underground, and as satisfying as rock music can ever be. It was an adventure."
3,"no, it's NOT that good","I like this album, it's pretty good, but is NOT comparable to Surrealistic Pillow or Piper at the Gates of Dawn! There are some very good songs on here, notably ""Dust"", but a good number of the tracks are quite forgettable, like ""I Had To Tell You"" and ""Levitation."" ""Baby Blue"" is just awful--I can't see why everyone loves it so much. And the ""oscillator effect"" really does get annoying after a while. So if you see this on sale at a used CD shop like I did, and like psychedelic music, get it, but don't expect a masterpiece."
3,Just not sure!,"One of those movies you need to watch more than once to really get the gist of. Im still watching again..... Superb actors though! It just may have been a not me story so I cant comment really. I do recommend watching it as it is not the usual movie of good guy, bad guy or romance. Interesting."
1,Sensation of Sight caused sensation of boredom,"I ONLY watched this movie for Ian Somerhalder and i regret it, no matter how much i love his acting, and his face, i could not handle the boring neverending drone of this film, it was just too much of the same gray uneventful happenings though the final parts were dramatic the climactic build to these parts were dull and a 10 degree sidewalk climbing to a -90 degree drop off. i would never force anyone to watch this movie"
4,Better,This is a definite improvement over season 7 that I found tired. There are some great moments with Frasier who shows what is to come later on his own show.
5,wheres season 9?,"""Cheers"" is one of the all time great sitcoms. Why the delay for Season 9? Usually Frasier and Cheers are released around the same time. The final season for ""Frasier"" is already out and Season 10 doesn t seem to be too far behind. Whats going on? I own the first 8 seasons and would really like to complete the collection. Paramount..whats the problem? Please finish releasing all the seasons of ""Cheers""."
4,download problems,This HD version keep reloading. I have had a problem with this on most of the HD versions. I am running at a 10mb speed.
5,No Mix-Up,"The first single off Sophie Ellis-Bextor's sophormore album bears all the trademarks of a great Gregg Alexander hit. Mixed Up World is a delicious piece of electronic retro tune that rips through the dancefloor.Though not something that you haven't come to expect from the lady herself, it's a tune that will almost get you to dance and sing along with immediately, especially the slick funky video (included as the enhanced track here) that brings you back to the 60's/70's.The Groove Collision Mix found on this single is a thumping club smash that transforms the song for the party people. You'll get an extra non-Lp track too."
3,Choppy,"This book has an interesting story, and I really wanted to see this guy get his due. The writing style was so choppy with no real flow I wasn't able to finish the book. If you can handle the choppy style and 3rd person narrative I think this could be a very rewarding read."
1,Echo Men's Wool Cap,"This hat keeps you very warm, but their is no liner inside to protect you from the itchiness of the lambswool. Also there is no elasticity around the cap to keep it from flapping up and letting wind in when it blows. I no longer wear the hat."
1,who is the translator?,"There is never a book called The Iliad by homer in English--it's always by Homer via a good or bad translator and I simply dislike and distrust any pubication afraid to say who its translator is on the front or back cover. Thus I heartily dislike this pretended non-translation of the Iliad, by Homer, which really means, it's all Greek (Achaean) to me!"
1,Yes - Typos,"Yes there are two typos on the back cover. ""Staring"" should be starring, and ""import"" should be important. I won't buy a book from a publisher that can't even have an error free cover."
3,history not like I remembered it.........................,"A fairly good read, but I am still Jonesing for the Penguin Classics edition of my youth. Or even the Classic Comic Book of my youth...:(And a couple of typos on the cover; what's up with that?????"
2,Will Try Fagles' Translation,"While I am sure many will love this translation, I found myself several pages into it with no clue what Homer was trying to say to me. I will try Fagle's translation instead; it costs more but appears more readable (at least for me)."
2,Not a Good Translation,Difficult to read this translation. Much too literal. Modern language interpretation needed. Better translations available from other translators and publishers.
3,Inconsistent,"This review is for the Kindle edition and not a review of the classic stories themselves (they are fabulous). I had no problem with The Iliad, the format was good and as easy to read as The Iliad can be. However, I was very disappointed when I got to The Odyssey because the translation went from the Greek names in the Iliad to the Roman names in the Odyssey. What a let down to get all the way through the Iliad, look forward to the next book, and to have the names changed on me! Despite what Shakespeare may have thought, names do matter.Guess its back to my tried and true paper copies."
2,Hard to Understand and I generally dislike the Iliad and the Odyssey anyways.,"I really really really dislike this book. xD I know, it's a classic and all, but I'm just not liking all the heartlessness and the blood and stuff. Idk. This is the one and only time you'll hear me say that the movie 'Troy' (2004), based off of the book, is much better or at least much more interesting."
3,"beautiful, but mixed up pages","I was thrilled to find that Calla had published a reissue of this beautiful book. My husband bought it for me, and it arrived quickly from Amazon. The book is perfect - except: the last several pages are mixed up. It goes from page 22 to 28 and then repeats earlier pages. Now I don't know how the story ends! Did anyone else notice this in their copies? I'll send it back to be replaced, and hope to receive a copy without the misprint.Other than the page mix up, it is well worth it. The large size is appealing, as is the heavy paper and bright print quality."
2,It's the reproductions . . .,"The reproductions are the reason for my purchase of this book. Now that I have it, I must disagree with those who say they're wonderful. The pictures are wonderful; the reproductions are pretty much as everywhere else I've found them -- just not that great."
1,Not for NT servers,"If you're running traditional UNIX web servers, you may find value in this book as it addresses many of the more common needs for CGI programming; however, if you're running on an NT web server, beware. Although the authors make an attempt to address the NT issues, I've been 100% unsuccessful in making their programming run. Other uses for $40. include: dinner, Christmas presents, a good movie, 2 pizzas, 8 trips to McDonalds, 1/2-pair of shoes, 2 tanning sessions, a copy of Harper Lee's book and a cup of coffee . . ."
2,"Sorry, I am not impressed.","I may not be the biggest fan of disaster films, but this movie was even worse than most. The acting is very weak, and the story line is just too weak. I would have turned the movie off, if my husband wasn't one who watches any movie once. I laughed my way through most of it, and finally gave up to read a book. Though the story idea may be a good one and the actors chosen have done great work, this movie was a major let down. The time would be better spent reading. I hope the book was better."
2,Sci Fi cliches galore,"Watching a string of Sci Fi's movies have basically shown me a pattern. 1. No matter what the disaster, a well placed nuclear strike ""just might work"" to avert it. 2. The President is always a black guy. 3. No one initially will listen to the Doc Brown scientist. 4. Everything will be fine by the time the credits roll.The plot in this one was pretty much copied later by ""Polar Storm""Overall, if you like these types of movies, it could have been worse, and Lou Gosset Jr is the man no matter how cheap the movie is!"
3,"Adequate, but Derivitive","As a long time Sci-Fi fan, I found this film enjoyable, but derivitive. The special effects were good, but not spectacular. The acting was better than I first expected. The story plot itself seems to be largely derived from Irwin Allen's original 1960 movie version of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", which is the better film in my opinion."
2,Good for a boring Sunday aftenoon,"I'm a big fan of Science Fiction and own over 400 titles. I always thought that world disaster was a poor premise for a science fiction move. This movie is a great example of why. The acting was marginal, the plot was not even that and there is little basis in scientific fact. Probably better not to waste your time."
2,Dead End Street,"A very confused attempt to be meaningful by a British professor who should have written a magazine article(s) with this material and not a book. Both the writing style and substantive thoughts presented are choppy and obscure.Not recommended except for those already deeply engrossed with all things touching upon this ancient city of Tibet and who are willing to put up with an opaque and disjointed presentation. (A universe of readers that, I wager, is lightly populated.)I often disagree with the national editorial reviews that are posted by Amazon, but here the March review by Publishers Weekly has this book dead right."
2,art out of context,A rock art guide for interested amateurs that attempts to classify petroglyphs and pictographs by their form. Draws heavily on older sources and fails to put the art into the context in which it was created. Useful for site lists.
4,Field Guide to Indigenous Graffiti - AKA Rock Art Symbols,"This must-have field guide was designed to provide a key to the symbols observed on indigenous (Native American) rock art found in the Southwest United States. The book brings together 600 commentaries on the different symbols, and includes a valuable pictorial key, organized by tentative meaning or description. 500 illustrations. The geographical range of the book encompasses Northern Mexico, Utah, California and Colorado."
5,Phenomenal book,"This field guide is a must for Rock Art enthusiasts! You can take this book with you on your hunts or simply photograph your rock art and then take home to research the meanings in this book. It doesn't matter where you are in the Southwest, this book will explain any pictographs or petroglyphs you find. It is filled with photos, drawings and explanations which are simple and precise to decipher.Whether you are a beginner or a true artifact hunter, this book is for you!"
2,flashlight worked great until I bought new batteries and then the power surge burned out the bulb which is too expensive.,flashlight worked great until I bought new batteries and then the power surge burned out the bulb which is too expensive to chance it happening again so I will stay away from this prduct
3,Bright for 30 minutes,I am the composite tool kit manager for our squadron in the USAF. We orderd 32 of the lights 2 each in 16 tool boxes. I used them under some of the roughest conditions. The light is great but cant take to many drops the bulbs are very sensitive. They also get very hot if used for extended periods and the batterys dont last long at all usually around 30 minutes of continous use. Great flashlight but I recomend buying the LED version at 80 lumens or the replacement bulbs.
2,"Great Little Flashlight, But....","There's something terribly appealing about the Surefire G2. It can be carried in a pocket, or a pocketbook, and can easily temporarily blind an attacker with a simply push of a button. Still, it's an incandescent light and despite its power, battery life is only one hour with two CR123 batteries.The G2 used to sell for $26. Now everyone wants about $65 and Amazon, $59. For that price, I'd recommend an Olight M20 Warrior, which is selling for $69 currently."
3,Up Grade the G2 with a LED Cree P61 for a great light,"I bought two of these flashlights based on Surefire's reputation and that I already owned a different model that I am happy with. The G2 just didn't put out enough light. I upgraded to Surefires P61 with 120 rated Lumens. This was a waste of $30 each. I recently found a new Cree LED P61 drop in replacement from Lighthound.com for about $20 including shipping. As they claim this is a drop in and use item for many Surefire Flashlights. This LED unit is fantastic. They claim 200+ lumens and I believe it. I had planed on buying a couple of, more powerful and more expensive flashlights however the combination of a Surefire $40 body and the $20 light upgrade is a hard combination to beat. That would make this a 5 star rating"
2,Surefire G2 die too quickly,These lights are decent but using the CR123 batteries becomes very expensive after awhile. I always seem to have a problem with them turning on in my pocket when not in use even though i properly turned the light to the off position. Surefire customer service did nothing to help out with the problem. This flashlight uses an incandescent bulb that burns out very quickly and is expensive to replace. I recently bought the Fenix E21 for about 35 bucks..it runs on 2AA batteries. The Fenix is much brighter..cheaper and uses more readily available batteries....and the light has never accidentally turned on in my pocket regardless of the conditions. The Fenix is a better light at a much better price and doesn't have the frustrating issues that the Surefire G2 has and is much more dependable..more cost effective.
1,This one was a waste of $20,The DVD is only 35 minutes long and the information is very basic. There is nothing here that is going to help you beat the pros and nothing that I would consider advanced. Save your money and put it into DVD's by Howard Lederer and Annie Duke.
5,Great purchase.,"The story line was great. This movie was very inspirational. If you like saint movies, I highly recommend you purchase this one."
4,Franciscan Joy at its best,The life of St. Joseph Cupertino is a unique life and it certainly is portrayed very well in this film. The special effects were done well and the whole spirituality of the saint is developed demonstrating how God was working in St. Joseph's life. I recommend this film to young people who are learning the basic tenets of the faith.
5,Very Good Film,"Shipped very fast, exactly as pictured/promised. A+. Bought This DVD for a friend for Christmas and it was in great condition and he was happy with them, even I liked this one"
2,What was the point?,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I had no ide what this was about, and after watching the movie I knew no more about the saint. I did some independent research on the Internet. The story coul have been much better told and presented."
1,"Olson 1/8"" 93 1/2"" Band Saw Blade","I bought this blade from WoodCraft. I set the tension on my Delta 14"" bandsaw exactly to the 1/8"" setting. I started cutting 3/4"" cherry with gentle curves and the blade suddenly snapped, apparently breaking at the weld. These blades cost 1/2 as much as Timberwolf. Maybe there is a reason for that. I can only say the money saved over a more reliable blade is definitely not worth the hassle."
2,"Adequate, but limited selection","Over the past several years, I've use the AAA guide, but found that since it only lists AAA motels, I miss a lot of good places to stay. I now prefer The Pet Travel and Fun Authority, since it has twice as many listings and also entire chapters on things to do with your pet when traveling."
4,Reliable guide for pet-friendly lodging,"Just put this newly purchased guide to the test during a trip through parts of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas with our 60-pound dog. The hotel and motel listings are very accurate and up-to-date, so we had few surprises when calling to book rooms or arriving at properties. The only improvements I would suggest are more recommendations for outdoor dog play places (especially those that are leash-free) and for restaurants with outdoor dining areas that permit dogs. We had fairly good success improvising leash-free play zones in national forest areas off the highways and were able to find some eating places with patios or decks that permitted dogs..."
1,Forget it!,"This book was a waste of money. With the use of the internet and the ability to search ""pet friendly hotels"" this book is a waste. In reality, you have to contact a hotel before you get there to see if they accapt your pet anyway. Even if they accept pets you still need to make sure they have a pet room available. Book is of no use at all....just a lot of hotels listed with the description ""check with hotel"" stated over and over again."
2,Okay book but don't buy an out of date copy,This book was a good starting point however quite a bit of the information was very outdated and not specific. I have two BIG dogs and most hotels only take small pets although this wasn't noted in the book or should I say the weight limit wasn't noted. They suggest you check before booking and that is great advice as it took a while to find a hotel in the book that actually didn't have a weight limit. Check the hotels website and make sure a pet friendly room doesn't mean the moldy room at the end of the corridor. I felt as if every hotel I chose wasn't a true pet friendly hotel and it became frustrating.
4,More like four and a half,"Black Box Recorder fascinated me from the moment I saw the video for ""child psychology"". They are probably one of the most interesting bands releasing music. ""The Facts of Life"", the latest offering after the simply superb debut ""England Made Me"", did not disappoint me. We start the album with the almost tongue and cheek sexiness (the la-da-da's of The Art of Driving), move into a beautiful lament (The English Motorway System), and rock out with instant popness on other tracks (Sex Life, The Facts of Life). The whole album is rather great, and surpasses their debut. My favourite tracks are The Gift Horse and The English Motorway System. The bonus tracks make you wonder why they weren't included in the whole. ""Goodnight Kiss"" is a beautiful song about that nervous moment before you lean in after a long date. Highly suggested."
4,A bit uneven.,"This appears to be the second all-Vivaldi album of Jaroussky.The countertenor voice is as good as ever in this album, but obviously the tracks are not as even as his other non-Vivaldi works.The slower arias have a definte edge over the fast bravuras, a phenomenon that may be largely due to the lack of chest support when the singer is singing totally in falsetto in the countertenor fach.Otherwise, this is another musically satisfying album from this phenomenal young singer."
3,Broken-hearted in Brownieville,"I am on my second attempt to create a heart-shaped Valentine treat with this pan. The first attempt, I followed the recipe and directions. I questioned whether or not the chocolate chip cookie would really come out by just greasing the pan with vegetable spray, as instructed, but pressed on. Usually I would line it with parchment paper. No dice. I finally got it out with a very long-bladed spatula and a lot of bad words. I checked the directions again, and thought maybe a brownie mix would work if I made a parchment ""truss"" to help it out of the pan. Greasing the pan before and inverting it as directions say does not seem to work. My brownie is wrecked. It's still a cute pan, but I wanted to give the treats as gifts, not have to give the pan as well. Though right now that doesn't seem like a bad idea.."
5,great baking pan,great pan for the money! no problems with cookie sticking to the pan. would definitely recommend this item to anyone who bakes.
5,as described,Arrived quickly just as described. My anniversary dessert was adorable and my husband was very happy. Look forward to using it again.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to make Valentine treats for my children. I am a good baker, decorating cakes, and various other baked goods. I personally don't care for cookies very much, and up til now haven't had an interest in making a giant cookie. This year I opted to make a giant cookie in lieu of buying my children a bunch of candy or yet another stuffed animal they don't have room for. So I was surprised to discover that the Wilton set I purchased didn't include any directions more-less a recipe. Now I have to waste time Google-ing exactly how this works, and fingers crossed that I don't have the same trouble that one of the other reviewers had."
4,Another Challenging Ride,"This is another challenging ride and pretty ride by Paul Gallas. I am spoiled by Paul's more recent videos, of which he has included some newer features, however it is a challenging ride with beautiful scenery. I will definitely keep it in my collection of great virtual rides to choose from and drip sweat over. Lori"
2,Boring,Used the Carmicheal tapes for a few years and liked them but wanted to vary the workouts so I purchased 2 Paul Gallas tapes. I found them very boring. I guess I like the coach giving me instructions. I will be returning both DVD's.
5,Swiss Army Kitchen Knives,"I love these knives!!! I received some of these knives years ago as a gift from someone who went to Switzerland, and I loved them,so I thought I would order some more. They are very sharp, lightweight yet extremely durable and look good enough to use at the dinner table."
5,great value steak knives,I bought the victornix 3 piece set with the butcher knives and paring knife first. Then i bought their santuko knife. I am hooked! The steak knives work terrificly and cant beat the price!
5,i have bottles all over the house & use it on every surface,"i've been buying and using Parsley Plus for a couple of years, and have slowly substituted it for all the other surface cleaners i had.Parsley Plus cleans stainless, marble, tile, wood, glass, mirrors and porcelain without streaks leaving a fresh clean scent.my local store changed ownership and quit carrying Parsley Plus, so i started buying it online and i trust it so much that i buy it by the case."
1,School Reading,This was a school reading and it wasnt good at all..very difficult to read and you should stay away from it...
1,Tedious,"How can I describe the effort it took for me to read this book? It took me almost a month to complete this novel! Not only does the author enjoy writing long, involved sentences, but he makes the narrator, Arturo Cova, drag out his interpretation of every event. I understand that this novel is considered ""great"" because of its contextual importance (the rubber trees in Colombia and Brazil), but I much preferred the ""great"" land books Don Segundo Sombra and Dona Barbara. Don't read this book unless you are required to do so."
2,The pot calling the kettle black,"Had my doubts reading the first chapter, hoped the second chapter would be more enlightening, but it just got worse and worse. There is a small chance Luhmann fans will like this book, but I sincerely doubt it. In the third chapter, the cardhouse falls together as Chai's rhetoric and mathematical 'proof' turn tautological to a point."
3,Burt Sugarmans MIdnight Special,Having just received my set of DVDs. Seeing these stars doing live shows is great. Video and audio are poor.
3,The Midnight Special(s),"This is a fun look back at the music and musicians of the '70s. I wish, though, that it was the whole season and complete episodes, and not ""the best of."" As I remember from the original broadcasts, each week a different musician would host--Helen Reddy, John Denver, whoever was hot. It was very cool and different from other musical shows that were being presented at the time. (Man, were they/we ever that young?! So despite the ""best of"" feel of the discs, I think it's worth your time. You'll find yourself remembering songs/groups you hadn't thought of for a long time."
3,Potential is there,"That album has some interesting melodies, however, it is hard to get passed the vocals at times. The vocals are very labored and somewhat hidden in the mix. Sometimes you're straining to hear them, and other times you are wished you hadn't. Worth a listen if it's up your alley."
4,resident evil with demonds,"I played this game about a month after I played resident evil and I have to say it reminded me of resident evil almost immidiatley.Thats a good thing! At first you haft to use an ansthestic dart gun wich kinda stincts, but eventualy you getta use a kick butt hand gun,then a shotgun, then an ausult rifle, and eventualy a ... magnum! Enemies include the undead, vampires, huge bats, amphibeans, gargoyles, and the man in black! I havn't beat the game yet so I'm sure there are even more enemies and more awesome weapons to kill em with. All I know about the boss is that his name is Geils and he's really tuff. Well I guss that's all I really have to say, so see ya!"
5,Countdown Vampires,"Yes,another company tried to do what resident evil did,but at least this company made it harder to play;more challenging.Firstly,when they are dead,you have to spray them with white water to make sure they do not get up again.Secondly,you have to watch your own back because these guys move faster than zombies in resident evil and do not take their time coming to you.They know you are there as soon as you walk into the room!Countdown Vampires"
3,Adoption of grandson,Our daughter is adopting a baby from Guatamala and this is a good way to find information on that country.
5,My son loves this CD,"My 2 year old is very stubborn about taking naps now that he's moved from his crib to a toddler bed. This CD doesn't always get him to fall asleep, but it does at least give him (and me) some time to rest. He actually asks for it when he gets in bed - he wants to listen to the ""Fred book CD."" I'm glad I bought this CD for him."
2,Close but no cigar,"Nice looking well fitting piece. But the plastic the cover flaps are made of becomes extremely brittle in cold temperaturesl, and due to this I broke both of my brand new covers off at the hinge within the first two days of deer season by merely bumping them when they were open. Should be made of a more rubberized piece."
3,polished singing on boring songs,"This is another ordinary release by Joe Lynn Turner.Joe should stick to singing for established bands/guitarists.He dosen't have what it takes to be sucessful on his own.Great voice and bland songs are going to intrest many,maybe next time Joe. P.S. call Ritchie if you want to be interesting again."
2,The material is too weak,"Joe Lynn Turner did a good job as the vocalist in Rainbow, but on his own, without Blackmore as a co-writer, things aren't as great. Turner has a good voice that he use properly on his latest project with Glenn Hughes and also on his two albums of covers (""under cover"" I & II).I don't why, but on this album (""Hurry up and wait"") as well as on ""Nothing changed"" something is wrong. The material isn't that good and maybe that has something to do with the fact that Turner's voice isn't as great we know it can be. It's impossible for me to rate this effort any higher than 2 stars To bring out the best of Mr. Turner, a good songwriter is needed. But things ain't all bad, there are in fact a couple of songs that are quite alright."
2,What and where is the story?,This is my third and last novel by Alan Furst. Three quarters of the way through the book and I still have not found a story. I am not sure how it is considered of the spy genre. It is obvious the author has traveled in Europe and knows Paris well. It is obvious he likes the details of 1940's France. It is not obvious that there is a point to be made or a story to be told. Without the ubiquitous cold-blooded sex scenes this would make a readable travelogue.
4,Furst's first as a series,"This book is the first in a series of books by Alan Furst about men caught in the turmoil of the early days of Wrold War II in Europe. This one is the first to consider Jean Casson, a French film director, who scrambles to stay alive and fight the Germans in the game of espionage. Furst uses his story to draw a picture of how it was then, and this is as interesting as one can be in the events of that time in that place. Two other of his books, The Polish Officer and Kingdom of Shadows, take this approach further East, and are much the better for it. Worth reading as a beginning to his other books"
3,Great writing supports a thin story,"I recently discovered Alan Furst and consider him one of the best period novelists writing today. I read ""Kingdom of Shadows"" first, which was excellent, and came to this novel with great expectations. While Furst again delivers rich characterization and the ominous atmosphere of German-occupied Paris, I felt the story did not rise to the level of the word craft.The main character is complex but is so detached and unopinionated that I found myself not caring about him or the choices that he made. His ennui soon became mine as I soldiered on reading this novel, waiting for something to happen. A hokey escape sequence followed by a maudlin ending left me disappointed.Looking back, I realize that I came to this book for a spy story and on that basis this novel fails; however, had I come to it to experience what France must have been like under Nazi occupation, I'd say the author succeeded."
3,I MOSTLY LIKED IT A LOT UNTIL THE END,"Furst is always interesting in my opinion, and having just come back from a trip to Paris, I was eager to read a Furst novel that takes place there. The recreation of Paris during the German occupation was very well done, I thought, and I liked the fact that Casson was a film producer because I think that makes for interesting reading. What didn't work for me was his relationship with Citrine - I didn't think Furst prepared us properly for how important the relationship became to Casson. And as far as the ending goes, talk about mailing it in. What happened - did the editors at Random House contact Alan on vacation in Provence and tell him his manuscript was late and to just send them all he had, even if it wasn't complete? That's certainly how I was left feeling. Oh, well. It doesn't diminish my enthusiasm for Alan Furst - just leaves me shaking my head a little."
3,"Strong on Paris, weaker on France","It is difficult to beat Alan Furst on atmosphere in Paris and I enjoy it thoroughly book after book.Having said that I find his evocation of pre-war Paris better than his Paris during the war.However the moment when he describes France outside of its capital I find the atmosphere dropping quickly,not just in TWAN but in other books as well. This is mainly caused by inaccuracies in French geography, like when hero Casson in TWAN is driving north with the French army in May 1940, passing through Rheims towards Sedan, wrongly stressing the Flemish aspect of the population here and remarking on the influence of the winds swooping in from the English Channel. It is like Furst is describing Pas de Calais and Artois rather than Champagne and Ardennes/Meuse.This sort of inaccuracies re France is such a turn-off that for me I find it difficult to enjoy the rest of the book when the story has returned to Paris."
4,Another gem from Furst,"Once again, Alan Furst has brilliantly taken us back into the 1930s and 1940s, this time to Paris in the immediate aftermath of the Nazi Germany invasion. The protagonist, a film producer who initially thinks life can continue as normal, takes us step by step through the transition from sadness to resentment to anger to resistance against a brutal occupying force.Furst's real achievement in this novel is taking the mundane and the normal and weaving them into the difficult and violent world of war and occupation. Everyday experiences like eating, drinking, earning a living, loving and talking are the primary daily behaviors around which the characters interact, but they are all intruded upon by the occupation. This is what makes the book so ""real.""Furst combines history, fiction, and the mysteries of espionage as well as anyone since Eric Ambler. He is always worth reading."
1,Comic book attempt at Greene territory,"Alan Furst is no Graham Greene, and nowhere does this become more apparent than at the end of this silly, often trite book. Up until the ending, Furst tries so hard (too hard?) to achieve all that came as second nature in Greene's ""entertainments."" In each chapter here we get at least five mentions of ""the shape of the world now"" or ""how big the world now is,"" etc. The characters are thin and interchangeable, and the frustrating translation of every simple French statement shows who this book is really geared towards. High schoolers."
1,horrible,i could only read half this book before tossing it --just bad!!!!no suspense no characters you can care about-no plot-i think i could write a better book.and filled with foul words and sex scenes(not too graphic but constant)save your money
2,Not Conrad,A nice try. The setting - an aging chemical tanker bodes well. The plot - if there is one is diffuse. This novel wins the prize for most use of the f- word per page.
4,Wonderfully Evocative,"In this book you are immersed in Paris during the occupation, you feel, see, taste, and experience life in this wonderful evocative portrayal of war time Europe.Alen Furst is a master of the gritty espionage thriller of period world war two. The story of movie maker Jean Casson, hedonist Parisian playboy, and his struggles to live and survive while his world collapses is intriguing and whole engaging, the only lapse is the story doesn't have a strong plot, it wanders and then ends... c'est la vie."
3,Tough Times In Paris,"Furst is in his old stomping ground of World War II here. Jean Casson, movie producer and reluctant fighter finds himself pinched between the storm troopers and the Paris he used to enjoy. Furst clips his sentences in a unique style that helps to keep the book moving. Just the same, I was hoping for a little more plot. That said, I always enjoy a Furst book for the history, the atmosphere and fully developed characters."
3,The World at Night,"Alan Furst continues to be one of the best reads around. While not as good as his amazing Kingdom of Shadows, this is a book you won't want to put down...even as you try to slow down to make it last longer."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"While this CD has some enjoyable tunes, one player's zither had annoying buzzing strings (poor technique or poor instrument set-up) and he overused vibrato so much that it became irritating."
1,Austrian Insturmental music at its best,"Beung a folk music entusiast, and having visited Austria at the end of August of year 2006, I was marvelled a when my wife and I were entertained at a folk dance beer merry making. We were so attracted to the event that we will return to Austria in the very near future. This time I will make sure to collect EXTRA fork musuc and folk Instumentals. Thanks Austria See you again. Alf and Myr"
4,Check it out!,"i'm an experienced limit hold'em player and this book did a great job of laying out the principles of big bet poker and helping with examples in different games that i've played and havent played sharing a lot of principles i couldn't quite quantify. winners thinks in a very verbose mannerism and books like this help train the mind to look at the proper factors. Good Read, Best No Limit Pot Limit book out there so far."
2,"I should have put more faith in the ""Short Stack"" review...","I regularly play limit holdem and I decided that I wanted to give no-limit a try so I thought I had better do a little research first. ...I was very disappointed by the book. I felt like I was reading a collection of random articles put together in a haphazard fashion. While yes, there are certainly a few nuggets of information to be found, the book is poorly organized, doesn't go in-depth enough, and veers off and covers some less well-known forms of poker, e.g., a chapter on ""Strip Deck Poker"".I think that I'm being somewhat charitable giving the book a rating of 2 stars,..The bottom line is that I can't recommend this book."
4,Best Big Bet Poker book to date,Much better than the Cloutier/McEvoy book. Really introduces you to the basic concepts of big bet poker. Teaches you what to think about when playing big bet. Clearly written. Definitely recommend it. Either beginner or advanced.
2,Am a Hold'em player,"I have read alot of poker books and this is in the bottom (of the ones I have read). It is to shallow and doesn't give you much of the practical information that other books do better. My two favorite authors on limit hold'em are Bob Ciaffone and David Sklansky (You should read the most of their material if you want to improve your limit poker, especially Ciaffones ""Middle limit holdem poker"" and Sklanskys ""Theory of poker"", ""Hold'em for advanced players"".). In the No Limit area I would rather recommend Doyle Brunson ""Super system"" and Dan Harrington books on tournaments. In the end Bob Ciaffones book ""Improve your poker"" is better then this one (cover the same thing but deeper), atleast if your intressted in Holdem only."
1,Many lies with little truth.,"In this age of hate Muslims, anything you can say to defame them is acceptable in order to continue a well coordinated western policy of aggression and colonialism. this book is zionist scholarship encouraged by racist intentions and behind it lurks the support for apartheid Israel.This book was debunked many times by the accounts of non-Muslims living in Muslim spain and Turkey for over 800 years."
2,After school special everyone.,"This movie is sometimes a comedy but mostly it deals with a real relationship and the problems that come into it when Eve wants to stay a virgin. Little bits are thrown in for comedic value and they center around Adam's roomates in college who are all disgusting (I would reccommend not eating while watching these parts, it could ruin your meal). Overall, everyone will see Eve as a total beyotch because she is being totally unfair in the relationship while Adam is a totaly douche. I would not reccommend this movie for it's comedic value, but maybe as an afterschool special? Ha"
4,"Great ""Guy"" humor","Adam and Eve proved that ""guy"" humor at its funniest, is best served raunchy. I thought Adam's character was believable and well acted, although I doubt Cameron Douglas has had much experience with ""blue balls."" Eve's character was beautiful, intelligent and evoked my respect. The actress has a great ass and great assets as an actress. I thought the script was sincere, very funny and relevant. Adam and Eve treats a woman's ""right to choose"" to be a virgin in college (oh my God, imagine that!) with respect and a raunchy dose of humor."
3,Since when has National Lampoon made chick flicks?,"This is a chick flick disguised as a National Lampoon movie, or vice versa.It does have a gross fraternity building with a couch outside, full of dirty garbage, inside and out, with a gross roommate with a blow up doll, and it does take place in a college. But besides that, it is a chick flick. Adam starts dating Eve, who's a virgin, and it's all about him realizing that he loves her even though all they're doing sexually is making out. And it's about Adam coming to terms with his feelings, and about Eve coming to terms with her fears. Blech.I could have sworn this was written by a woman, but it turns out Adam and Eve has a male writer. I guess guys can write chick flicks, too. This movie was just okay for me, but I'm sure your girlfriend will love it."
3,"Entertaining, but not scientific","Don't look for Attenborough or PBS-type science in this account. The film is as much about the quirky characters of the neighborhood as it is about the cane toads.That said, an early interview with an old gentleman discussing the precarious position that the cane toads have him in is absolutely hysterical. The director gets a lot of mileage out of having Australians say ""cane toad"", which is in itself hilarious--all the more so since they don't crack a smile."
2,If your stuck in science class it would'nt be bad.,This movie is not a cross between Monty Python and National Geographic. It is an old documentary about some toads that took over Northern Australia. I was expecting alot more after reading the reviews above. Stick to National Geographic at least its current.
5,Environmentally sound!,"This movie, although a cross between Monty Python and National Geographic, is a must for EVERY environmental student. I show this to my high school environmental classes every year to demonstrate how introduced invasive species can decimate an ecosystem."
5,A Million Laughs,"This movie was educational, but what I liked about it most was the people. I could hardly stop laughing at (or rather with) the down to earth people of Austrailia. If you want to learn and laugh at the same time, buy this movie!!!"
2,Don't like Huggies Supreme!,"I can't stand Huggies, when my baby wore them at night she had little gel beads all over her bottom in the mornings from the diaper being too wet. Huggies are also way too thick, they don't work better than any other diaper that I've tried and I tried a lot, I think they are worse because other cheaper diapers I've tried don't fall apart when really wet! They are NOT worth the money!! I like White Cloud ...they are very comparable to Huggies Ultratrim but they don't leave little gel beads on my baby's butt!"
4,Manners from Heaven : A divine guide to good behavior,"This is a funny, light and enjoyable book. It does have a bite , so you must NOT take it too literally . He does bring an unusual twist to things. Great thoughts and funny points of view make it worth the read. This guy was a ""HOOT"". Excellent poolside reading! Enjoy!"
5,Are Primatologists Trained as Political Psychologists?,"I won't repeat what the many [!] other reviewers have said. I could echo most of their praise and also the criticism about De Waal's overlooking bonobos' emotional fragility under severe stress. But I'm amazed that no one has extrapolated his observations to a certain sociological analog that hit me in the face, left me guffawing, and will never again let me associate republicans with elephants and democrats with donkeys. It'll be chimps and bonobos for me from now on!"
2,Disappointed by the Political Overtones,"I selected this book based on De Waal's reputation in primatology, interested in his thoughts on the root traits that define our human societies. Instead, he stumbled into politics often enough I finally set the book aside, unwilling to mix an objective study of science with a subjective analysis of world political problems. He could have cited a variety of international examples, but chose to concentrate on the USA and a few others, leaving me uncomfortable about his motives. I suggest he stick to science in his next book."
2,One thing that no one is discussing,"One thing that no one is discussing out of this book I just finished.We share over 98% of DNAand many behaviorsWhy then, has never a Chimp or a Bonobo ever been filmed praying? or making an Idol out of a stick? They use tools right?If one was seen doing this, I am sure it would be filmed by now and shown somewhere. Decades of studies, and filmed, nothing of what I said has ever been seen.They just are not as evolved? No, there are no animals at all, ever, the world over that have been recorded to be praying or making Idols out of anything.Even Bush men in the Amazon, that have never seen the White man and his religions, make Idols.Why haven't any animals been recorded sitting around having any conversations? They yell and make plenty of noises, the world over, but none have ever been recorded sitting around and have any conversations. That's just because they are not as evolved? No.Discuss? Email me"
1,Dont buy it,"Just got 5 hours into a book Our inner Ape.,and had to delete it. This ""scientific"" observational behavior of apes book was leaning more and more left. Then deteriorated into political monologues, were Reagan, Bush & Thatcher were likened to apes. He initially made decent observations, but when political dogma starts twisting your research all your work is garbage! This is available as a free audio book at your library...don't dare spend money on it."
3,"Good, but not profound","Our inner ape has lots of observations of chimp and bonobo behavior and it is interesting to hear how these observations apply to human nature. The focus was more about apes and experiments that have been done, the author's experiences, the nature of these apes. Really anyone who has lived around apes could have written this book--and has. I've heard a lot of the same information in other books. I was hoping for more profound. Perhaps about how much of an animal we really are, direct comparisons of our nature to that of apes and other animals. The author doesn't seem to have any special knowledge of human nature which leave is coming up short. Interesting overall tho."
4,OUR SOCIAL CONSCIENCE,The great enjoyment of this book lies in its clear uncomplicated language. It gives us the opportunity of reflection on our place on earth. This may be the occasion to put our 'uniqueness' in perspective. Revelations on our biological heritage give us the comfort of knowing about our inherent endless potential for adaption in a rapidly changing physical and social environment. Such thoughts should give us an optimistic outlook into the future.
4,Our Inner Ape,"A strength of this book is that the author develops concepts which areunknown by the reading public. For instance, bonobos understand and canempathize with each others' needs. Coalitions of chimps are key for leadersto develop allies. Sometimes, death is the ultimate price to reach thetop. The author believes that if chimps had guns and knew how to use them-they would be violent enough to do so.The book makes for interesting reading; however, I don't whether or notthe conclusions reached can be mapped to human behavior."
5,Our Inner Ape: a Lesson in Life,"Incredible. Every page had my undivided attention. Never have I ever thought that I'd be interested in reading a book about apes written by a Primatologist. But this book isn't so much about our furry friends as it is about us.Frans De Waal explains ""why we are who we are"" by investigating and reporting on our closest ancestors, chimpanzees and bonobos. In doing so, he manages to transform such simple and common behaviors that we've come to take for granted into fascinating concepts - like why humans wave hello to one another, tongue kiss or obsess over finding that special someone.This is more than a book about apes -- it's a lesson in life."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a low budget movie not worth your time. The acting is poor. The camera work is jumpy at times, someone was having a difficult time holding the camera still. At times the editing was poor, all of a sudden going from one scene to another. It's supposed to be a horror movie but wasn't the least bit scarey. There wasn't any plot, just some guy with a mask going around killing people, usually by sawing their head off with a knife or sticking a knife through some part of their face and then ripping their face off. I assume he chooses this method as it may have something to do with why he wears a mask (at the end of the movie you see his ""face"") but you never find out what happened to him or why. Nothing redeeming about this movie."
4,Want a good slasher flick? BAM.,"Robert Hall once again shows fans of gore AND good movies he can bring it. LTR reminds me much of the original Halloween wave of horror flicks. Actual characters. I just saw Zombie's H2 over the weekend and while I liked DEVILS REJECTS, LTR kicks H2 all over the map. I'm old school, I guess. I like some tension and release with a story. Hall and company didn't need to 'reimagine' anybody else's movie, they came up with an original monster and made their film. If you like a WELL made slasher flick, here it is."
4,You want gore?????,you got it. Good acting? I thought so. Good plot? Twisted I really dont know who the bad guy is and why he is killing people. Still he's good. I love the chrome mask he wears. Not many slow moments. The main character is very good looking. I won't ever trade or sell this DVD.
3,"Solid kills and direction, but lapse of logic","As a fan of the genre, I liked Laid to Rest and welcome Chromeskull to the league of horror villains. I am somewhat a fan of writer/director Robert Hall's previous work, Lightning Bug, so my expectations were up a bit. As a director, I think he's got a solid future ahead of him. Pacing was good, storytelling fine, and the kills were mostly top rate. The main problem with Laid to Rest is with the writing. I don't set the bar too high when it comes to low budget horror, but there were too many lapses of logic. At one time or another, each of the characters make some head scratching decisions. Maybe a co-writer might have thrown out a few ""Why is he/she doing that?"" that would have cleaned things up a bit. The top notch kills and engaging characters and story allow me to forgive the logic lapses and recommend Laid to Rest with a respectable 3 1/2 stars."
2,No attempt at a plot,"I don't mind bad horror, I find a lot of it to be quite enjoyable. What I don't like however is mindless horror. Slasher flicks are not typically known for their strong story lines however it's nice when they at least attempt to add one in. This movie is nothing more than running and killing with a dash of bad dialogue tossed in. Some of the death scenes were pleasantly graphic but hard to enjoy considering how RIDICULOUS the killer looked with his shiny skull mask and shoulder mounted video camera. I was hoping for more out of this one but sadly it was not much more than a waste of time. Not recommended."
3,Expect slasher action... no less... maybe a tad more.,"While watching the movie, I looked up the director online and found an interview where he stated his desire to make an 80's-style slasher film. No more. No less. In that regard, he delivers. If you want a high body count with explosive gore (aided by the time-honored lack of common sense found among protagonists in slasher films), you've struck red gold. Will I cop to getting a little bored in places? Yeah. Still, it has a few fun twists and turns to surprise audiences. Also, it seems to be a (tiny) homage to PEEPING TOM, which was a plus. If you like slasher-time ""old wine in a new bottle,"" this will make for a fun Saturday night. Added bonuses are some extremely solid performances among the leads and a plot that isn't really driven by teens getting lost in the sticks. In many ways, it felt like a long episode of MASTERS OF HORROR and should appeal to fans of that great show."
2,......such a crap movie,"Want blood? plenty of that. Bad acting? Plentiful(especially the main actress and old dude that trails her throughout the movie). How about a cheesy villain who wears a shiny skull mask and black suit.....its here too! All pieces are in place for perhaps one the crappiest movies i have seen in some time. Aside from a couple awesome deaths, this dud is def worth passing up.....unless its free"
1,Yes I HATE it.,"because even though the film has prolly the best practical (read: not CGI) efx this side of 1982, the horrible 'acting' from lead actress/producer/director's wife, Bobbie Sue is just too atrocious to ignore. Couple that with an undeveloped script (read: not written by a professional writer), and the flimsiest of plots, and you're left with a fanbase of horror nerds who can't string two sentences together without typos and head-scratching grammar.For those of us who truly love horror, this movie, however hard they tried, fails to do anything but summon a whole buncha 'what-ifs'. Like:What if they had a solid script?What if they had a solid actress?What if Bobbie Sue's only talents lie beneath her shirt?What if, indeed... FAIL."
2,A paint-by the-numbers slasher film,Laid to Rest is a flashy and gore filled horror film starring the very attractive Bobbi Sue Luther. If you're a fan of hers then you might enjoy this film more than the average horror fan. Other than that you might be turned off by the music video style editing and the nonsensical plot. I some scenes it felt as if I might need a seat belt because of the camera movement. I hope to see Bobbi Sue and her new look in more films. She has what it takes to be a horror star. I just wished that she would find a better film to showcase her talents in. The extras are nice but at times they can be very self indulgent.
3,typical slasher film,It was not a bad horror film. few really good scary moments. It was something that was okay to watch
4,Curious,Does anyone know if the filmmakers have ties to Baltimore? The market scene was like a twenty minute advertisement for National Bohemian beer.
1,Not as good as I hoped,"I know the job of advertisers is to promise a great product to make everyone rush out to buy it, and unfortunatly I fell for it hook, line and sinker. A few of the death scenes where new and creative, but overall the movie was just not good. Save your money, this movie will probably be on the Sci-Fi channel shortly, along with the cheesy 8 films to die for."
4,Gore!...Gore! and welllll more Gore,"The worst thing i hate about horror movies is there is more gore or nude scenes than the movie. Why i like this one i really dont know, the FX is really good and it'll make ur stomach turn..trust me!!. If you like this stuff then you'll enjoy it..if not, you might want to get something more tame ..good film, but, not for the faint of hearts."
3,slasher with a halloween mask,"Okay for an indie horror movie, somewhat repetitive with the kills, but has it's moments. Helpful if you are a horror type"
3,"Average horror movie, nothing special","Plot: A girl wakes up with amnesia inside a coffin. She gets out and encounters a woman, a computer nerd and an old guy.Soon they are all being chased by a villain named Chromeskull who wants them dead.He wears a videocamera on his shoulder and videotapes his killings.- That's it.Low budget, decent gore, no rhyme or reason to anything- just killings, average acting and heavy metal music.It wasn't so bad that I would rate it below a 3 because it was entertaining to a certain degree. Mindless entertainment- you most likely won't remember this as a ""great"" horror film, you will probably not think of watching it again.Let's just call it decent. Definitely a rental only."
2,Not a good waste of time,"While this appears to have been filmed on a low budget, it still somehow manages to have some familiar faces. I was excited about The Sarah Connor Chronicles connection, although that was tempered pretty quickly. The movie isn't all that exciting, and it doesn't set the right mood to make up for its shortcomings. I'd avoid this one."
1,Style but no substance,"I had seen Max Lucado on Larry King, so I picked up this book. It was disappointing. Yes, it changed my thinking. But only for a few minutes. There was nothing in the book that really ""stuck to my ribs"" spiritually. The book did not encourage me to dig in the Word or to make changes in my life. I don't plan on reading any more books by Max Lucado."
5,"Can't Stop Listening to ""God Came Near"" Simply a Great CD","The message's alone are great to listen to, and the music is fantastic! I'm hard to please, but this CD is great, it will help you better understand God, it will help you strengthen the Holy Spirit in you, it will help you be a disciple for God. God is in every song and word of this CD. It will help you give your heart to God. Young and Old alike, love this CD. This CD will fill your heart with JOY!"
5,This inspires amazing reverence and wonder for Jesus,"Though this is typically thought of as something to be listened to during the Christmas season, I listen to it year-round when I need a lift about my worth, a reminder of how wondrous God's love is, or for any other reason or for no reason at all. This is truly one of my all-time favorite audio recordings. You can't listen to this without your heart swelling with the love that God has for you!"
5,Wow,"With Chapter titles like, Twenty-five questions for Mary, and When God Sighed, this book is sure to bring you closer to our Savior. I felt closer to God after reading this book, and I highly reccommend it to anyone seeking a closer relationship to our Lord."
3,Lucado almost gets it right,"God Came Near is Max Lucado's exposition on the ""absurdity"" of God becoming a human being and coming to live among his people. The title, cover copy, and topic will make you think this is a Christmas apologetic, but it isn't. This is Lucado's musings on his wonder of God lowering himself to be a human being.The book lacks a central theme, but with Lucado this is refreshing. It is more like a compilation of essays that revolve around the incarnation of Christ. Lucado's prose is poetic, though sometimes redundant. But overall this book is a good read.Lucado never gets too deep, but if you are looking for a title of his that comes close, this is it. The main reason is that he doesn't try to resolve the incredulous nature of his topic. He just presents plenty of aspects of its beauty. I don't normally recommend Max Lucado, but if you're going to read one of his books, read this one."
1,not so good,Did not work well as a traveling companion. I think there are much better books available to help with menu items.
5,Highly recommended listening for smooth jazz fans,"Jeff has captured my attention with this recording. I rate it near the top of my collection which is currently about 250 CD's. His implementation of the Flamenco technique on my 2 favorite tracks (Passport To The Heart, and The Love Club) reaches the soul to accomplish its work... Thank you Jeff"
3,Inside Ride is still boring,"I don't know if any DVD can replace riding outdoors, but this does ok. Beats watching the news or nothing at all. I've watched it several times, and its getting boring."
4,Shockingly Great,"I bought this CD because of a good review I read way back when it was released. I could not believe how powerful, and excellent it turned out to be. I listened to it for months in the car that year!The collection was well put together, with some interesting songs chosen (Cover of Bob Dylan's obscure ""Man in a long black coat"" & ""one of us).The range in styles from rocker (""Right Hand Man"" & ""Spider Web) to popish art rock (""St Teresa) is intrigueing.A wonderful CD, and a promising talent."
4,Fans might like Lucinda Williams as well,"I just got this album today mostly because my kids are huge Joan of Arcadia fans and because most of the customer reviews raved about this artist (and rightly so). It is a great album. Part way through our first listen, it struck me that Joan Osborne reminded me in some ways of Lucinda Williams. Fans of Joan Osborne who are unfamiliar with Lucinda Williams might want to give her a try, especially the World Without Tears CD. Just a thought."
5,Whatever happened to Joan?,"I think ""One of Us"" is rather amusing actually, but perhaps that isn't the best place to start.""St Teresa"" is the place to start. This remains one of my handful of favourite songs of all time. It starts with that glorious frenzied torrent of mandolin, leading into Joan's soaring, achingly magnificent vocal and one of the great choruses.The rest of it ain't that good, but it ain't bad either.""Ladder"" is great, ""Lumina"" gorgeous, ""Right Hand Man"" is outright dirty. Even a Dylan cover just for a laugh.Something obviously wasn't right though, as Joan has never approached the peaks she scaled with this recording. ""Righteous Love"" wasn't a bad shot, but mostly it's been silence.Shame. ""Relish"" lives on however."
5,Stunning presentation!,"I first saw Joan on House of Blues Live way before her cd was released and heard her sing ""Crazy Baby"", that was it, the cd was sold in my opinion. So many styles to chose from, reminds me of the old saying.....she could sing the phone book and sound good!"
4,"An uneven, but still good, CD","We've all heard ""One of Us"" enough times to be quite ill, but it is only one of the songs on this CD. An exceptional song is ""St. Teresa"" which vocally reminds me a bit of Stevie Nicks. ""Spider Web"" is also a very good, blues sort of song. This CD is occassionally lyrically clever, and reflects an interesting outlook on life. The music varies, but usually settles into some blues oriented rock. In all, it is deservedly popular CD."
5,This is one of my favorites - ever. Perfect for romantic evenings and cool parties.,"This cd is perfect for romantic evenings and laid back parties. Every time it's played, someone asks ""Wow, who is this?"" or ""God, don't you just love Joan Osborne?""I wore my original copy out, so glad to have another one."
1,a big letdown,"If you're expecting more of the great soul and blues you heard on ""Early Recordings"", forget it. A lifeless effort."
5,Nothing Short of Staggering,"I found my jaded views of contemporary music to be pleasantly stirred with Osborne's most recent contribution. Strong influences of soul, but perhaps moreso of blues, come across in Joan's superb delivery. There were times when I could swear I was hearing Big Mama Thornton, Etta James, Lou Ann Barton, and Janis Joplin. The songs are delivered with passion and poetry delved from Osborne's life experience. Do not miss this one and wait, like the rest of us, for the next exciting album (perhaps now out)"
5,I'm ready to love her!,"About two years ago, I knew and saw Joan for the first time from TV performing at the charity concert for 'War Child' with Pavarotti. Her singing ""St. Teresa"" was so impressive with her unique voice that I immediatley paid attention to this talented artist. I bought the concert video mainly because of her live. This morning I listened to the song ""St. Teresa"" twice from the CD album of the concert. I love her voice as well as her style.I've forgotten to buy any of her albums so far. Now I will start collecting her own albums with this album first. Yes... I'm ready!"
2,Only like one song on this CD,"Interesting CD. Is okay, tried to get through all the songs, just like one. Good product, good price, fast shipping. Thanks"
2,Good Music Broken Case,"The CD is a fine CD, but Amazon shipping has a lot to be desired. The case has one of the ears that work as hinges broken off. I thoroughly searched the sealed envelope the CD came in and it wasn't in it so it didn't happen in transit. The case was damaged before it was packaged, and the individual packing it or the person who broke it had to have known."
5,cd,I was extremely pleased with the quick shipment on the item. Seller was very prompt and item was exactly as advertised. Thanks again!
4,Good pop-rock album,"Releasing this solo album, Jon Bon Jovi showed his softer side compared to what the band Bon Jovi had done so far (its clearly best album is, by the way, New Jersey).And he did good. Because on Blaze Of Glory, he gets a lot of things out of his system which he couldn't get out in the band. In the lyrics as well as musically.Of course, this created an album definitely worth hearing, and on which every single track is good pop-rock! When I bought the LP years ago, I listened to it at least five times a day for weeks, and it is still among my nostalgic favourites.The top track is the beautiful Santa Fe which is introduced by the Billy The Kid tribute Blood Money.Blaze Of Glory is worth buying, especially taken into consideration that neither Bon Jovi nor Jon Bon Jovi have succeeded in making anything that accomplished since then."
4,Fit well,"For Jon's 1st Soundtrack by himself he did a great job. He managed to get some of the biggest names in the industry,and even had to turn some down. I found it amazing how he got alot of respect from Jeff Beck. That says alot since Jeff is a legend.And he did a good job of tellin the movie thru the songs..as is the case with Blood Money. Emilio Estevez did a good job in pickin Jon..he captured the movie in this release"
2,NOT YOUNG GUNS,"IF YOU ARE A BON JOVI FAN, YOU MAY LIKE THIS CD.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE GREAT SOUNDS IN THE MOVIE""YOUNG GUNS"", THIS ISN'T IT."
1,Bon Jovi CD,When the CD came it was in the Blaze of Glory case but the CD itself was some rap group. Seller said she would refund but did not.
1,THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE.,"BON JOVI IS O K IN ROCK BUT THISHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK. I BOUGHT IT THINKING IT WAS THE SOUNDTRACK BUT IT IS NOT. AMAZON HOW ABOUT AN EXCHANGE, FOR THE REAL SOUNDTRACK? I WILL SEND YOU JOVI."
2,"GOOD, BUT COULD BE BETTER!","I am a long time fan of this solo release, but I'm disappointed with quality of this Japanese 2007 Reissue. Others Bon Jovi titles have been the quality of 20 BIT REMASTERS, released in 1998 in JAPAN, US and Worldwide.This solo release remains the 1990 Master, not remastered.The Package is excellent, lyrics both English and Japanese, but the quality of sound could be better. 2 Stars."
5,Must own for BJ fans,"This album is in my top 3 favorite Bon Jovi albums (even tho it is a solo record). In this record, you really get to hear just how powerful and gifted Jon's vocals are (with some exceptions - such as in NJ - usually only demonstrated live) - Santa Fe solidified in my mind, the assertion that Jon Bon Jovi was one of the most gifted singers in rock & pop music with very few people (in rock/pop) able to come close to his vocal abilities."
3,Dissappointing,"Not as good as I had hoped, but it does have some good stand alone songs, but overall not the best."
3,Distinctly modern take,"Without a doubt, demonstrated by his involvement with a number of Bud Powell projects over the years, Corea has been deeply involved with,and inspired by, Powell's music, down to the smallest nuances. Interestingly, Corea does not pay tribute with a ""Powellesque"" sound, but a very contemporary/free take on Powell classics that is often fresh, sometimes harsh, occasionally beautiful. Fascinating that Corea chose to record a quintet arrangement of the bizarre and disturbing ""Mediocre"", which Powell himself performed in 1955 (Verve). It is hard to tell if Powell was sick, or the song is ahead of its time. Nevertheless, Corea loves this tune. (He also chose ""Mediocre"" as one of Powell's best works, in his role as producer of a Powell anthology). The lasting impression, whether you like this Corea recording or not, is that Powell's music is timeless."
3,Nice performance,"Bought this used at a store for a few bucks. Didn't quite meet my expectations, but still a good listen."
4,Coincise,"It's a good problem solving book but not much on theory. However if you have background of probability of statistics, this can be a good reference."
1,Not suitable for younger kids,We bought this for our 4 yr old. He can hardly understand what to do with the amount of reading instructions involved. Even our 6 yr old was confused at times with the amount of reading involved. Both kids lost interest very quickly.
2,NO FUN AT ALL!,"I bought this game for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter. Luckily I tried it out before the event and realized that it was not only very boring but also too difficult for a 5 year old level. Way too much reading involved my daughter could not have played this game without help. Also it's always the same boring activity (play a board game). I sold mine on e-bay and got my money back! Don't buy this one, it's not worth it. I gave it two stars because the graphics are nice."
1,Not for young kids,"I got this game for my daughter. She was so excited when she saw it, but then when she tried to play it she couldn't. You need to be able to read quite well to play this game. I think by the time your old enough to play this game, your not into Pooh as much any more. It is quite challenging and not for any child who cannot read well."
2,only for baby players,this game is very boring if you are 6 up you should start leaving wini da pu but i love tigger he is very cute
3,THIS GAME KICKS BUTT,"My sister is 5 years old (I'm 13) and she recently got a Game Boy and this Pooh game for her birthday. I was EXTREMELY BORED and went up to my sister's room to play it. Even though this game was so-so, I played it for over an hour."
2,disappointed,"My 6yr old daughter wanted this game..she was bored with it in less than 1hr. All games are the same..doesnt take any brainpower to play,"
1,Poo Poo on Pooh,"This game should be perfect for young children, but isn't. It requires at least a 1st grade reading level and even us adults had trouble figuring out how to move from place to place. I found this game to be incredibly disappointing and would not recommend it to anyone. My 5 year old was so upset that she couldn't make it work. My recommendation: try the Arthur or the Blues Clues games instead if you are buying for a young child."
5,The Charming Bear Is Back,Winnie the Pooh is back.This game provided fun for hours and at the same time a challenging game that delighted me and my friends.The graphics look really good on GBC.I would recomend this game to kids of all ages.
1,not for small children,My five year old son and four year old daughter like Winnie the Pooh but they were not interested in this game. It would be interesting to disney fans who may like searching through the woods for secrets. It is far too complicated for a child to keep track of all the data and too slow for a teenager.
1,Don't buy this game,"We bought this game being very fond of Pooh, but, but, but... No action and you're supposed to be reading very well. If you visit a place in the 100 acre forest again, you have to read the same text all over again, it takes time and slows the game to extremes. Nearly all the ingame games are based on tossing the dice. Once you're in a dicegame you cannot get out and all the dicegames are very alike.Very fast it becomes VERY monotonous. So don't go wasting your money on this!"
2,Too boring for my 7 year old!,"I bought this game and a GameBoy system for my 7 year old daughter for her birthday since she really likes Winnie the Pooh. Unfortunately, she only played it a couple times, then begged me for a new game. Since then, she hasn't touched it and sticks to her Mario and Pokemon games. If you have a little one that you can sit with, read the text to and play together, then the game isn't bad. By the time your child can read well enough to play alone, though, he'd be bored. Buy this game only for littler gamers and only if you intend to play with them!"
2,Fun? Ha!,"When I hear people say this game is fun all I can do is laugh. The same activities over and over. The same games over and over. I am seriously bored stiff. Sure you start out with an open mind, but when the save icon doesn't understand the meaning of saving a game and the same Owl tells the same dull story you are forced to listen in on. So I ask you would you want a game like this, a game made for five year olds and yet too difficult for them. Save yourself the extra bucks and don't buy this game. I wish someone could have told me it was so uninteresting."
1,The Worlds Worst Game!,"""Silent Bomber""....Save your $. This game is a waste of time. If you have a life don't even rent this game. If somebody gave this game away for free I wouldn't accept it. This game is so easy you can beat it in 2 hours tops. It has the worst story line created. Now I'm like most people and like multiple games, but this one sucked big time. Please listen to me and do not waste your time on ""Silent Bomber."""
5,Reggae Hawaii style,A big fan of the reggae group Big Mountain...I found this album by accident... I recognized the name Quino (the lead singer of Big Mountain) and discovered he went on his own to record this album... Well he has capture a softer sweet blend of the reggae sound and mixed it with Hawaiian flavor... going on a long drive.. play this album and even the busiest highways will seem uncrowded.. now he is currently making another album... this time with a Latin sound..
2,Marginal Bond Knock Off,"If it was elegant, and the 60s/70s were eras of staggering cultural charm, it would be an elegant period piece. As it is, it's almost watchable if your cat doesn't do something more distracting than rolling on its back with its feet in the air. There were hopes for nudity, but alas, vaporized like a butterfly in a laser beam. My advice would be that you would get more out of the rental price by putting it under your pillow and sleeping on it."
1,diaper,"Holy cow what a price hike! I could use a coupon anywhere and get this diaper for 7.49, but the convenience of ordering on line was awesome with 2 in diapers, but the huge price hike made amazon lose a biiiggg diaper customer."
5,great diaper!!,"My son wet through every diaper I tried until I was given a pack of Huggies Supreme. He has not leaked through yet! He even lasts all night in the same diaper. I bought several packs at a time on Amazon.com back when they were only $7.49. You couldn't beat that price! But now at $11.29, I can get them anywhere for less than that. Sorry amazon."
2,Not as good as the regular Huggies diapers,"We are big fans of Huggies in our house (as much as you can be a fan of a diaper brand!), but did not like the Huggies Supremes at all! They seem smaller than the regular Huggies, and don't stay fastened as well. Thankfully we bought the Supremes in a small package - my dh especially disliked them and couldn't wait to use them up!"
1,MAJOR LEAKS,"I switched to Huggies because they were cheaper than Pampers. It was a huge mistake. These diapers leak constantly. I have to change my daughters outfits 2-3 times a day when she wears these diapers. Also the tabs pull off real easily, making diaper changing a real pain. I highly recommend paying more to get the better quality from Pampers."
3,Not a fan of Huggies Supreme,"My wife and I have tried many diapers for our son and I would rate the Huggies Supreme a distant second behind our favorites. We did not experience any of the blowouts or tears that other folks are talking about, but the diapers just never seems to fit ""just right"". The absorbant material that they use in the diaper gets very lumpy as the diaper fills up and it ends up that my son is uncomfortable not because he's wet (which he isn't) but because the lumpiness causes the diaper to fit funny. Contrast this with our favorites, that absorb and expand evenly, and it's no contest."
3,Informative but rather superficial,"This film is informative but rather superficial. If you know well the hassidic world or search for a deep understanding of his ways and thinking, this will be not enough for you. It gives information and (bless God!!) is sympathetic, but if the mind and professional expertise of the fim makers is there, the soul is not. And the soul, the neshameh, is an important thing in hassidism after all..."
4,Movie as expected,"I had to purchase this for a Relgions class to view and write a paper, the movie was interesting and as expected."
1,"bad Movie, dosen't pay","it's a total mess, they took sarah jessica parker to make it look intersting, it is just badmouting and bad manors with no taste at all"
5,"briliant examination of culture,travel and creativity","Art imitates life and Dyer tries to wrestle with both the need to write versus the need to experience; and by reflecting on both we simultaneously experience both. A wonderfully written, on the mark experience."
2,Neurotic author avoids...life,"I had high hopes for this book. I sit disappointedly writing this brief review, as there is not really much to say, precisely because the author does not say or do much. In fact, he makes the whole point of the book his failed attempts at writing two actual books: one a novel, the other a book about DH Lawrence. ""Rage"" is used appropriately in the title, as kind of a double entendre for the author's rage at his own inabilities, but it also references DH Lawrence's own quote regarding his attempt at writing a book on Thomas Hardy. While the author's writing style appeals to me, it is drudgery to get through this, unless you're a crazy, procrastinating, lazy, neurotic nut like the author. I read books to be swept along, and my disappointment here lies in the fact that the book sweeps you into the life of the author, which is depressing and weird. Plus, it's pretty hostile in there. If you can read detatchedly and you enjoy frustration and hostility, go for it."
5,Excellent Cleaner for Motors and Electrical Parts,"1-29-13. THis product has consistently provided a quick and excellent solvent to clean grease, dirt and other materials from electric motors and related parts. It's not a electrical contact clearner as it tends to leave a residue. CRC makes a good contact cleaner. The fumes are toxic, so use it with good ventilation (outdoors is wise)."
4,Great product - One thing I would like to see different...,Overall I am very happy with this lens. I use it with an HDR-HC3 & it definitely widens the captured range with no distortion. It is especially useful if you are working in small areas or find yourself panning around frequently. I have 2 complaints on this lens though - it obstructs the flash on my HC3 so I can only take photos with this lens in good light. This is really more of a design fault on the camera than the lens but... Other thing is it does not allow you to use any filters - I would like to use some polarizing filters etc which this will not allow for. Otherwise good product & would recomend.
3,Sony Lens,Happy with quality except should have had leash on lens cap and lens should have had threads for filters. This was a let down.
3,Sony VCL-HG0730X Wide Angle Lense for the HDR-SR1,"The Sony VCL-HG0730X Wide Angle Lens is solid and very well made with zero flaws in its build quality. The lens is clear with no fish eyes or other imperfections. The lens is heavier than I thought it would be, but does not seem to add much heft to the camera. The weight adds to the testament of a well made lens.Having said that, the field of view was not increased as much as I would have liked. I don't believe the high price is worth the minimal increase that is gained in width."
1,Too Old,"I purchased this item for educational purposes, but the truth is, I am only going to show my class a 2-minute snippit of the program as it is incredibly boring. Although it was recently produced, its aesthetic dates back to the 80's. While I'm sure the program has a lot of information, its delivery is far from creative or appealing."
1,Absolutely Underwhelming,"Granted, I am a graduate student in theatre and film, but this video is absolutely deplorable. Save for a few choice interviews from the current Dean of the Moscow Art Theatre and Jean Bennedetti, a leading Stanislavski scholar, this video is nothing more than roving powerpoint images overlaid with bad background music and the most boring lecture on Stanislavski's life that I have ever heard. This project could have LITERALLY been done by any undergraduate film student, and probably done better. Save your money, go to the library, and rent a few books/movies on the subject. I was sorely disappointed."
5,Is Strega Nona out of business?,"Strega Nona (Grandma Witch) is back again. And now nothing happens in the little town of Calabria. And the baker's daughter is learning to become a Strega. But un-like Big Anthony, she listens to people. So who do you think will get a job? Or if both Bambolona and Big Anthony both worked the same job, who would be fired? Big Anthony of course. In less he starts listening to people. One Day Strega Nona gets a letter in the mail it says. ""Cara Strega Nona, I would like to pay you a visit. Would next week be convenient? Please let me know. Amore e baci - Love and kisses- Strega Amelia"""
3,"not groundbreaking, but lots of fun","There are many great recordings that display Randy's terrific talent as a composer and improviser.This one is more of a nice collection of tunes, nicely arranged with a lot of brazil mixed in. Gil Goldstein does a great job with the production and keyboards. It's really is an enjoyable disc to listen to. Some of the tunes remind me of some of those early Brecker Brothers melodies...The guest appearance by old Brecker band pal Dave Sanborn is a bonus...Shawn"
3,sarah snow whats with the title,Please don't taken any notice of the tittle this is a must for all rick spring field fans I am a big fan I found it grown on you after just one listen. It contains some good dancing tracks its a mix between Shock anger and karma. It has become one of my favourite rick albums. so do yourself a favour and take a listen I guarentee will not be disappointed trust me
3,Rocks But Lacks Soul,"Springfield fans who like songs along the lines of ""Bop 'til You Drop"" and ""Dance This World Away"" will love Sahara Snow. As much as I anticipated the release of this CD, I found the production to be too slick at times. Rest assured, this CD rocks, but it has little soul. The vocals, guitars and percussion often seem to be competing against, rather than complimenting, one another. Springfield fans will no doubt attach themselves to ""Rovianne"" and the CD's one ballad, ""Somewhere."" For my money, the best song on the CD is its last--""Lust."" Any song with the lyric ""I've got the right rat, baby, but the wrong disection"" is worth the purchase price."
1,Sounds Like Bad Music from 1985,"I have been a huge Rick Springfield fan since the early 80s. I have religeously purchased each of his CDs... with the exception of one - Sahara Snow. Well, I recently came across the CD online and decided to purchase it. What a mistake! As big of a Rick fan as I am, the album outright .... Although it was released 1997, it sounds like music straight from 1985. The kind of 1985 music that has not withstood the test of time.Rick, I love you man, but promise me that you will never work with Bob Marlette and Tim Pierce again.P.S. I'll be purchasing the new album the day it hits stores. Karma was excellent... so I know Rick still has a lot of great music in him."
4,A Great Collaboration between three great artists!!!,"I had heard so much about this CD from many different people that I just couldn't wait to get it. At first listen I though it sounded a bit dated. However the more I listened to it, the more I loved it! Some of the ly""Rick""s on this CD provide some of the most erotic imagery of Rick's songwriting career! This is a great CD to pop in the car and drive to."
5,An R.S. Fan Must Have!!,"Any RS fan has to get this album. After a long(9 years)hiatus, Rick returns a little quietly under a group name on a foreign label. I've owned this album since it's release and haven't been disappointed. I own every album of Rick's from Beginnings to Karma and Sahara Snow fits in perfectly! His guitar and vocals have changed over the years, but his emotion into each song is still pure. If you are a fan like me, it's worth it! Best songs: Lust, Psychoactive, Somewhere, Rovianne, Modern World. Let's ""Dance this World Away""!"
5,One of Springfield's finest,"This cd has a bit more of the hard side of Springfield. His fans know that live he really rocks, but is usually fairly restrained in the studio. Well, this is a good balance, and one of his best cd's ever."
2,Andreas could do better...much better.,"I have just about all of Andreas Vollenweider's albums except for the latest 3. Last two I bought were Eolian Minstrel and Kryptos. I did not get the Rose album because it was not of the calibre of his other works. When Eolian Minstrel came out, I was very satisfied with it. Then came Kryptos which much of the album was not of the same spirit that Andreas had with his previous works but I bought it because of one of the pieces that I became hooked on. When the Cosmo album came out it was just not good at all. It just sounds like he put no heart into it.I do hope that he starts to go back to how he had previously put these projects together starting from Caverna Magica."
2,"Andreas, where the hell are you going?","I am disappointed that Andreas has recently failed to live up to the expectations which his recordings usually arouse in me. Basically, there is no substitute for the sumptuous melodies and inventive rhythms that abounded in his early releases. Later Vollenweider has been marred by insipid, meandering vocalisations. And this CD reinforces my opinion that a musician I admire should stick to what he does best - playing the harp."
2,Very dissapointing,"I am a fan of Andreas since his first release years ago, I would always rush out and buy the latest record/CD the moment I found out there was one. I usually do not review the music, I trust in his brilliance and have spent countless hours listening to his harp, it is extraordinary, unlike anything else out there. However, since one can listen to samples here I tried it just before clicking to buy this new release -- I could not believe what I was hearing! Is this Andreas Vollenweider? I even went so far as to drive to a store and listen to the entire CD, hoping with each new song to find ""the old Andreas"" -- he is not here. A real waste of his superb talent, his genius, and not worth buying. I could not be more dissapointed."
4,"The music is great, but what about the sound quality?","This one of Andreas, though not the best for me, it is higher than Eolian Minstrel and Dancing with the Lion. I think it should be in any New Age collection.But... I got a bit disappointed with the sound quality. Please listen to the very first groove and in the flute solo that begins the record. I hear a harsh sound very strange. Can somebody tell me if they hear the same?Fernando"
3,The high points are so good...but there are also valleys,"My feelings for this CD are a bit mixed, but the enjoyable part is very enjoyable. Especially enjoyable to me were ""Morning Poem"" with Carlos Nunez on the low whistle, ""Vals Del Sur"" and ""Long Road to You"" (how often do you hear an ocarina?).There were more vocals than I would've hoped for on this type of recording. And it very definitely does not flow when you play the CD through. However, try the sequences given on the booklet's back cover, ""The Loop Map"", and you will achieve far better flows. If only the cuts had been arranged according to those suggested loops. To do so, there would've been a repetition of ""Capriccio"", but that would've okay.I like and respect Andreas Vollenweider and think that he certainly deserves better than three star reviews, but if I'm honest in my opinion, and yes, it is strictly subjective opinion, I feel he's fallen way short this time. Maybe more of his own talent and better sequencing next time...."
3,long awaited come back? but is it really worth it?,"To tell you the truth I really waited for some new stuff from my long time hero, Andreas, but this is not what I expected. Sorry something is just not there, or maybe I got use to his old melody. But the music is still a experimental magic, that's why I give cosmopoly 4, maybe after a while the magic will sink in, and stay forever ... I just hopes so, I paid alot for this cd..."
4,You could like it !,"Please, don't teach the artist how to compose. Better consider the fact that tastes differ. As one of the above respected fellow reviewers here, I also posses almost every Vollenweider CD, and I bought this one automatically, because I like his LATEST style. I really do. I find this CD quite soothing, and if you want to hear some of those dull harp variations on same theme, better stick to White winds or Caverna Magica, because you wont find them here, or on Kryptos and The Book of Roses. This piece is consisted of short well-composed soothing instrumentals/vocal parts. I highly recommend it to every fan of good world music."
4,Every child's fantasy,I love this movie. This is something every child wished for when they were younger. It's a really cute movie and the guy who plays the Iroquois is HOT!!!
5,Excellent Family Movie,I bought this DVD for my two children (8 and 5) as a Christmas present. They absolutely loved it--couldn't take their eyes off of it and actually sat through the entire movie! The price was a bargain; I received it promptly and I'm sure we'll be watching it over and over.
5,Indian in Cupboard,"This is an excellent movie for families. It gets children's imaginations working and promotes discussion on right/wrong, caring, discovering that ""different"" people aren't so very different after all. Highly recommended."
4,Litefoot does an exceptional job.,"I felt that the film while geared to children , had alot of grown up issues, and was presented to the children in a way they understood. I was appreciative of that but I must confess that my favotrite thing about he film was the ever gorgeous Litefoot, I personally am a big fan of his music and acting and am proud that he is a young Native Man doing something to make life better for himself and for his people. He's a man of many talents and this is one of the many examples."
1,Why?,"Great idea, fine acting, but why do they have to take the Lord's name in vain? Ruins the whole thing for me."
5,great product! and services,received the product in fantastic shape. plays great and the seller sent the item very quickly. would definately buy from this seller again!
5,Indian in The Cupboard DVD,"I bought this movie for my oldest son when he was little and it was his favorite movie for a few years. Now I just bought it for my youngest son in hopes he would enjoy it just as much, and he does. He absolutely loves it and he watches it every night before bed. I would recommend this movie to everyone young and older :-)"
3,COWBOYS AND INDIANS,"Based on a popular children's novel, THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD should entertain young children with its tale of a magical cupboard that can bring toys to life. Hal Scardino stars as young Omri who receives this magical gift from his brother. He discovers its qualities when his best friend gives him a toy Indian, and when he puts it in the cupboard, it comes to life, a tiny little live Indian (played with straight frankness by Litefoot). His friend wants a toy too so he puts the cowboy figure in and out comes a swaggering, funny David Keith as the gunslinger. Britain's popular comic Steve Coogan shows up too as a British medic that the boys use to help when both the Indian and the cowboy are wounded.Adults may find it a little too ""cutesy"" but it's heart is in the right place and Scardino is an affecting little hero. While not a classic, it is an entertaining family film."
1,"Great book dumbed down into sappy ""morality play""","Having read the book with my children, and being delighted with its imagination, vivid characters and imagery, laugh-out-loud predicaments, and the subtle underlying story of a child's gradual emotional awakening and subsequent sense of human interconnectedness and responsibility -- I absolutely detested this movie. It was almost as if Mr. Oz had a ""Humor-and-Depth Detector"", pinpointed all of the book's worthwhile scenes and aspects, and then completely DRAINED the story. His characters are shallow and one-dimensional and the most engaging, as well as thoughtful, encounters in the book are missing entirely. THEN he goes and finishes with a beat-'em-over-the-head, ham-handed, condescending ""lesson"". Bad, bad, BAD. Needless to say, I was not only disappointed in Mr. Oz's film; I was disgusted."
5,Love it,"A staple for kids. If you're a grandparent, a must have. My grandkids will love it forever and ever and ever."
5,Theme is wonderful,"My grandson William is ten and loved the movie. He has watched it at least five times since getting it for Halloween! I can tell you he will have Mom and Dad and everyone else viewing it. Oma, picked this for him and it made her an even bigger hit in the family!HRJ"
2,"Not sorry I bought it, but","I'm not sorry I purchased the DVD because my son really enjoyed the books. However, he reported the movie was not nearly as enjoyable as the book, and my 11-year old daughter had nothing but criticism for the movie. Frankly, they said it sucked."
4,For children but has some depth,"First I think this movie would stand up to any modern day film in terms of special effects. You don't see any obvious blue screen effects so you can be transported into the miniature creatures' worlds. The boy in the story is struggling with some real life issues, but not too deep that it makes this an adolescent film. It still is appropriate for kids but the boy sees a life and death struggle."
1,Disappointment,"Too expensive for the items included.The photo shows a brown rectangle image that I mistook as a ""cupboard"" for the key and figurines; turns out to be a cheap cover for the VHS movie.Indian in the Cupboard: Gift Set (includes 5 figurines) [VHS]"
3,Good for younger children(agea 4-8),"My six year old son opened this movie up after reading the book, and was fairly disappointed because it moved rather slowly. It had no music score to keep you interested as most good movies do, and it skipped a lot of the best parts of the story that are found in the book. On the whole, I would recommend reading the book and forget about the movie. Kids have a great imagination and should use it to picture the story from the book."
2,No need for some scenes,Bought this for my grandkids without viewing first. I have now sent a warning to my daughter in law to preview it before letting them see it. Cuss words and a music video make it the PG I think. Could have done without both and probably rated it G. From now on I preview even kids movies before sending them to the grand kids. Had I done so I would not have sent it. I hope the Borrowers which I also haven't seen but sent is OK. Now I'll go get it from the library to watch.
2,Not A Very Beievable Acting Job,"In this movie, they show the character's feet at seemingly random times. Play upbeat music when it isn't needed, and some of the parts don't make any sense. When Omry (guy on the front) is asked (by his mom) how he felt, he said, ""I fell pretty (BEEP!) good!"" and the mom just stood there, smiling. (I'd like to see some REAL kid pull that one without getting busted)Omry gets a cupboard, that when something is placed in it, locked in, then taken out; is alive. when he first meets the Indian (very scared at the time) and tells him his name is Omry, the Indian suddenly calms down, as if his name was soothing (????). And Patrick, Omry's friend, is probably the worst acting job of the movie.A not-so-good acting job and lame plot don't make this movie worth your time."
1,The book is great but the movie sucks!,"I love fantasy movies like Hook, The Wizard of Oz, and The Neverending Story but fantasy movies like these are just awful when I saw this movie in the theater along time ago it was just too boring for me. It's a lot like the Toy Story movies but I thought Toy Story was way better than this. I think the story is great but the movie is just too slow. Probably a better idea to stick with the book the movie sucks itself."
1,Insidious anti-Indian film,"This film looks wonderful at first glance. But when you stop to analyze what's going on, you realize that the boys are playing with real living toys (i.e. thay take the living figures to school when they know better). The boys never let the Indian have a gun to have equal protection. And the whole idea behind the story is a re-inforcement of the US government's attitude toward Indians: ""You're nothing but little people. We'll take care of you because you're too small to take care of yourself in this big (read ""real"")world."" This film is dangerous to young children's attitudes about Indians."
1,I'll get straight to the point,*racistUnless a parent is going to use the book/movie as a learning tool to show explain racism to their child don't buy it.
1,Never received,"This was ordered on 5/27/09 and never received/billed. Not sure why or what happened, but not impressed."
5,The Indian InThe Cupboard: Book vs. Movie,"I work for an after school program and I have read the book several times (once a year) out loud to a group of 40-56 children, ages 5-11. As well, I have been present when, after completing the book, the children have watched the film version.I have this to say - Any story(both book and movie)which can hold the attention of a large group of children that age is nothing short of a MIRACLE!There is enough action to engage the older kids, but not so much that the younger ones are frightened.The screen adaptation held to the book very well, with little deviation. One thing I did notice was that Omri of the book is quite obviously British, whereas Omri of the movie is an American. Aside from that, I can actually picture the scenes from the movie when I read the book to the children at work. This story, whether you choose the DVD or the book, gets 56 thumbs up - one from every child in our care group!"
5,Becoming another Children's Classic,It's amazing that a movie made in 1996 can be ordered in mint condition in 2011! This was a great treat for my students after having read the book.
2,"My goodness, what an insult to the book!!","We just got done reading this book in our homeschool so naturally I rented this movie hoping it would bring the words to life. This movie is a mere shadow of the book. Omri's family is nice and even the boy who plays him is okay. The Native American who played the ""Indian"" (Litefoot) did a wonderful job but the script was so pathetic. The boy who played Patrick was repugnant and not much of a real friend. One of the major things that just absolutely kills this movie for me is the excessive amount of cussing (at one point Omri even says a cuss word to his mom, and she responds with a proud, wide-mouthed grin). Not only that, but in one scene the boys even have the cowboy and Indian watching a raunchy music video, and plenty is shown to make it offensive. These were fatal mistakes in my opinion, I am sure I am not the only one who was turned off by these things. It would have been so awesome to see what a really good director could have done with this movie."
3,Not close to their other 4 CD's - a true freshman effort - enter at your own risk,After listening to all FIVE of Niacin's CD's I must say this one is lackluster compared to the others all of which I would rate at 4 1/2 stars or higher. There are signs of the genius on this CD that Niacin is but not enough to warrant a repeat listen. Buy the other FOUR CD's and skip this one unless you are diehard. 'Time Crunch' is their best to date and is a great place to start your Niacin diet as well as 'Deep' which came out after this CD and shows unreal progression from this mundane CD. Hope I saved you some cash or boredom.'Nuff said!!!
3,Not up to expectations,"Frankly, when I see names like Billy Sheehan and Dennis Chambers on the roster, I expect some monstrous playing. I expect the doors to be blown off, but my house is still intact. Instead, this is a passable collection of instrumental tunes that make for pleasant background listening.The playing is rarely challenging and the musicians hardly cut loose. Chambers on drums has some great moments, but Sheehan on bass is quite restrained. The few times he does rip off some wild bass runs, his axe is so buried in the mix that you miss it if you're not listening closely. Only a few of the tunes really get the blood pumping, others are just sort of bland with melodies that don't stick to the brain.I KNOW these guys are capable of much more challenging, cutting-edge music - because it took them until their 4th album, Time Crunch, to do it! That is the definitive Niacin CD to get if you want to have your doors AND your roof blown off!!!"
3,Not like the picture,"I bought this thinking that it would be a natural wood color like the picture shows, but upon receiving it, it was actually black so it sticks out like a sore thumb in my kitchen. Not extremely happy with it."
2,"A disappointment, hard to follow","While the topics included within this book are facinating, I found the author's writing style very hard to follow. Each essay seemed a disjointed stream of facts just as if this was an early draft waiting to be pieced together.If I were to grade this academic's work, he'd get a C-.What's most surprising is that the author's other book on a similar topic is ""Embracing Defeat"" which is a good read and I definitely recommend."
5,BEST CONCERT,"This DVD is one of my fav and to the moron who judges bands on looks he can go to hell, they dont have long hair and mosh well SO what go take a hike you think they care Eddie Vedder is like 45 he is acting his age and so they have energy on a stage big deal and the audience is not zombies if you noticed what can they do its a full arena buddy go listen to your metal crap If you think they are overrated why buy the dvd or even right a freaking review."
2,Rubbish concert.,"They really could of done alot better than this!!!The band look awful ""image wise"" and Eddie Vedder could of sung better and moved a bit more.Hopefully they'll get their act together for the next tour.""By the way"" get rid of that f*cken organ player!!!"
1,Pearl Jam - lost what they had,"Pearl Jam have not only lost the energy they once had as a live act, but also have lost it musically, as far as their last album ""Riot Act"" showed.If you compare ""Live at the Garden"" with Pearl Jams earliear peformances, it really looks quite dull and plain boring.Eddie Vedders singing is'nt up to much and the band seem to just stand around looking fairly unenthusiastic, the only cool looking members of the band on stage being Jeff Ament(Bass) and ex Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron (Drums).As for Eddie Vedder, he just tries to eat his microphone or maybe he is just stumbling into it face first as he is nearly asleep, it certainly sounds like it, while it looks like a couple of members the band could do with losing a few pounds.This live perfomance is boring and confirms Pearl Jam are plain awful as a live act today, which is a real shame as they used to be fantastic - musically and on stage."
1,This just plain sucks.,"What the hell happened to Pearl Jam? They had one awesome debut then fizzled out and went to radio gaga. This DVD is not exciting, is very boring and the crowd as well as the band look half asleep maybe because of all the crap music after TEN that they made this set list from.. ....this truly sucks."
1,Embaressing.,"While ""Riot Act"" (2002) is probably the bands most strongest album yet, the tour that followed definitley was not.Onstage Pearl Jam don't even look like themselves anymore, well at least on the 2003 tour.The deliverence and shoegazing performance leave so much to be desired, its only a worse follow on from the 2000 american tour where the band looked exhuasted and bored, after what looked like a pretty impressive previous European tour of the same year.Probably the reason is that the band are't 21 anymore, and have become slack.Hopefully with rehearsals, eating properly, and new inspiration they will make their next tour back to their best, and end this drudge which has made them look silly in recent times.Don't buy this, their last decent tour was 1998 or Europe 2000, so one day hopefully we will see a DVD from those times or prior to that.New album soon.........."
1,Lost it long ago,"I used to really like Pearl Jam when 10 came out. In fact - it inspired me to pick up a guitar for the first time. I figured if they could do it - I could. Not a good place to start in hindsight. Looking back now, Mike McCready is pretty feeble and has delusions of Hendrix.I stopped listening to them after everyone jumped on the bandwagon and they started releasing those excremental follow-up albums. A friend of mine was paying this DVD at his place the other day and I got a shock. I've not followed them since about 1992 and I couldn't believe how old they've got and how annoying Eddie Vedder's voice has become. Does he try to sing like a goat screwing a sheep or is it unintentional? Whatever - he's awful.Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!What a shock to see a bunch of former rockers, playing boring music, looking old, tardy and fat from too many good meals.They had so much potential."
1,Pearl Jams DVD collection (all 2 of them are a bore),"Pearl Jam are more of a band of the 90s, and really they should of stayed their and done something else different because the last decent album they released was ""Yield"".Thats not to say ""Binuaral"" and ""Riot Act"" are terrible albums its just the production on both of them is bad, Eddie Vedders singing is a bore and the songs just are'nt their, thats not to say you should not have them in your CD collection - hah!As for this laughable Pearl Jam at the garden DVD, well that just reinforced why Pearl Jam are a band of the 90s, and back then they were an energetic and proper enthusiastic live band.Since then it blatantly seems they have become slacker and boring, fatter and unexciting and older (which is no excuse) to be such a bore on the stage.You would never beleive how bad this band has disintergrated over the years.No passion whatsoever, they just look like they are their for the moeny - which of course is a huge shame."
1,Appalling.,"What an appalling effort from what once was a brilliant and hard rocking band.The band look [...] and more than one memeber look like they've gained a fair few to many pounds.No emotion, no soul, no energy like they once had in their live performances and as for Eddie Vedders singing, well why does'nt he just say ""Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh"" and it would have the same effect.Please don't waste your money on this piecePearl Jam are'nt even a shadow of what they used to be.And don't listen to Pearl Jam fans who will accept and listen to any old [...]they put out (since 1999).IF PEARL JAM ACTUALLY CARED THEY WOULD PUT OUT A DECENT DVD OF A LIVE SHOW OF DECENT SONGS AND A DECENT PERFORMANCE of when they had'nt [...] to the renouned american [...]"
3,Buy 'Touring Band' instead,"The 2000 tour was better than the 2003 tour. A compilation of the best performances is better than a single concert, and an overrated one at that. Therefore, you should buy 2000 Touring Band instead of this. That's really all you need to know.Specifically, the band just doesn't look like they care anymore. The setlist is riddled with sub-par 'Riot Act' material and unnecessary covers like ""Gimme Some Truth"". Even on classics like Evenflow and RVM, the performances lack the passion of THREE years ago-- let alone a decade ago, when the songs were spawned and I was too young to go see them. Oh, and Indifference (A song they should have played more in their prime) turns into the Ben Harper show. Boo.Pearl Jam is still one of the top bands out today, but that has a lot more to do with the general badness of new rock than anything to do with the band."
2,Awful.,"Pearl Jams live shows in their more earliear years used to be 100 times more energetic and more exciting than this.If you've seen the video clip of Even Flow, you'll know what I mean - of course thats quite an intense of peroformance but even so, they could perform with a bit more enthusiasim and energy, after all thats what a live show is all about.Other low points are tha bands image, Mike McCready looking very fat and the band don't seem to have much of an image, just trundling on stage with their shorts and T shirts and a stupid bottle of wine!As for the organ player..well! totally uneccessary.Also Eddie Vedders stupid mirror act and the spinning strobe light?......c'mon, they're still making great music, their live shows have slipt its just a shame.Touring 2000, is so much better than this, but still nothing compared to their life shows from Ten, Vs and Vitolagy tours."
2,They used to be alot better live.,"And please don't think that many are expecting their long hair performances from the ""EVEN FLOW"" video clip, but remember that Pearl Jam are suppossed to be exciting live and this DVD, as nicely packaged as it is, is terrible.The performance is the problem.Eddie Vedder, you'd think could move around a bit more, and sing with a bit more emotion instead of just stumbling into the microphone face first. (he also looks like he's put on to much weight since the 2000 binural tour, and looks weird with short hair and no beard?) not to be a whiner here but a bands image is important too.Rockstars are'nt suppossed to dress like everyday people in nice tidy polo shirts?Matt cameron does a great job on drums, as for the organ player ........this band are really taking an odd direction and its not really neccesary.Hopefully they can step it up a bit next time.They really should release one of their live shows from 1994 or 1995 on DVD."
1,What Happened,If not for a chance meeting to create Temple of the dog Eddie would be waiting patiently at the base of the expressway exit asking for change. A great talent might have been wasted. This DVD had no energy and outside of a few good songs it runs out of gas quickly. If you are a huge fan buy it because you should support your passion. If not a Huge fan move along.
1,A Joke.,"Pearl Jam used to be good, now they're just a joke and this DVD shows it.Do not buy this its awful.They were great until after 1998."
1,Very Bad.,"Pearl Jam seem to be making a comeback witht their live performances at present, but this DVD shows the band at a less than impressive peak.They all look like they're pretty bored (especially compared with their previous shows) and have eaten to much throughout the tour before going on stage.A good DVD to avoid."
1,"Dreadful, worse than their Touring 2000 DVD","1. A ""Grunge"" band (supposedley I guess these days)like Pearl Jam should not have a singer with short hair!!It just does'nt look right.2. If Pearl Jam can't be bothered performing on stage with energy they may as well call it quits.3. This DVD is boring, the crowd don't mosh, they just stand, like zombies, the music is perfomed so badly that its not worth moshing to - fair play I guess.and finally - Pearl Jam since Vitolagy and an exception to their ""Riot Act"" album are one of the most overated bands ever!I'm only being honest."
5,I was there and it was FANTASTIC!!!,"The DVD does a great job of capturing the feel of the show. Having been there that evening I must say it was a great show full of energy and excitement that hasn't been seen at the Garden in a long, long time. During ""Do The Evolution"" the crowd was rocking so hard that the stage actually shook (which freaked out the band). The guest spot with Ben Harper was truly enjoyable as he was embraced by the crowd like he was a member of the band. Truly a magical evening. The bonuses on the DVD are also great with the pre-show Eddie Vedder songs as well as a performance of Hunger Strike from Mexico with Corrine Tucker from Sleater Kinney. This DVD set is a great value and is another great addition to my Pearl Jam collection."
5,WOW what an amazing concert,"I am one of the biggest pearl jam supporters since they broke big back in the early 90's and they have never disappointed me and this dvd just reassures me that they never will. i was able to get the cd lost dogs and the dvd on the saturday before the public could buy the cd/dvd by ordering through pearljamstoreonline and i was instantly blown away. the entire band has such a great chemistry and are able to connect with every fan inside the garden. highlights for me that stand out is the crowd singing the chorus of betterman to the band (definetly got some chills there), indifference w/ ben harper (simply b/c it might be my favorite PJ song ever), and baba o riley (teenage wasteland for those not familiar w/ the who or havent heard PJ cover it before) the band along w/ steve diggle of the buzzcocks had so much energy even after an over 2.5 hour set...just amazing LONG LIVE PEARL JAM and ALL THE TRUE LOYAL FANS THAT HAVE STUCK WITH THEM"
4,Great show,"Have this DVD for 3 years now and it is fantastic. The filming is very good, no extravagant and over-the-top production, no lightning fast scene changes that will give you a headache. The quality of the PCM track is very good but that results in a slightly weak video transfer(whichc will be apparent only if you view this DVD on a High Definition TV) owing to the space taken up by the PCM track.Disc 2 is my favorite. To be honest i prefer watching them play the cover songs like Crazy Mary, Sonic Reducer, Baba O'Riley even more than the originals.Some may find this concert a bit too long and its true that there are a few songs that could have been omitted like Cropduster.Nonetheless this is a great concert and absolute value for money."
3,Disappointing effort from the master of Afro-cuban rhythms,"I wouldn't just flat out say that this album doesn't rate a puchase, but I would say that I definitely rank Conga Blue far behind the absolutely fabulous live Latin Soul album and the ocasionally average but often fabulous Afro-Cuban Fantasy disc.These recordings, other than a very few, just didn't have much flavor to them. The tempo of the album as a whole is much slower paced than the other listed recordings which is nice but doesn't really turn me on.Check out Latin Jazz first then Afro-Cuban Fantasy and finally if you have to Conga Blue."
2,Dullsville,"Sure, Watermelon Man (patterned after the Gerald Wilson recording) is fun, but the rest is unimaginative and uninspired. Mostly it's about the band leader's bongo solos, which are boring indeed. A genuine disappointment."
4,One of the great ones,"Angelina Jolie was great in this film. She has a truely magnificent rack. They kept me mezmorized just starring and worndering what it would be like to be there, with those perfect pectoral specimens. A great watch, just need the pause button a lot!"
2,Something about this movie makes people dizzy....,"This is a protest to the person or persons responsible for not posting my first review.I don't know exactly why it wasn't posted but, if it had something to do with the profanity(I included the made up word Whatthef!$kedness spelled just like this)then there is precedent in the posted customer reviews of Guns n Roses Appetite for Destruction.If you felt that my review wandered outside the guidelines for customer reviews I have to strongly disagree and point out that one of the customer reviews already attached is merely a suggestion to watch a mostly unrelated tv show about the pornstar Savannah.If it is possible to find my review and post it as written I'd consider it a personal favor."
4,Better Than Expected!,"I read the book ""Thing of Beauty"" when it first came out, and was saddened and moved by it. Although the video wasn't always true to the real story, I thought it was convincingly acted, and I especially liked the cinematography. I am not often moved by movies like this, but this one got to me. It managed to show how quickly a sensitive soul can be destroyed in the ""fast lane,"" and that this destruction can be aided and abetted by those who call themselves your friends. Kudos to Jolie and Ruehl, especially."
5,"Beautiful, but haunting movie!","I loved this movie! The format is wonderful, the acting is superb, and the story is both haunting and beautiful."
3,Skip the R rated one. This is the ONLY version worth seeing!,"The movie Gia (based on a true story) is very well made for an HBO film. Jolie is really good and uses her ex-modeling skills a lot in this one. The R rated version cut out a good amount of nudity, so it will be nice to see it all put back in. For those of you wondering, YES Angelina Jolie is naked in a LOT of this film and NO it doesn't have a happy ending!"
4,Sad but true,"This is a really good movie. Unfortunately, it is very sad as well. Even though it could be argued Gia did not accomplish much in her short life other than modeling, she had a large effect on people. This is due mostly to her drug use, and general volatility.Angelina Jolie doesn't look like Gia, but having substantial modeling in her background made her good for the part. Elizabeth Mitchell was excellent as her girlfriend. All the other characters were well-acted, too.It is always sad when someone dies early in life. Gia is notable for being one of the first women to die of (drug-related) AIDS, in 1986.No notable extras on the DVD. Get it for the movie. The last shot was a nice touch.I'd never heard of Gia until I bought the DVD. I'm glad I did."
5,Two thumbs up for Angelina Jolie,"I first saw Angelina in ""Hackers"" and then in ""Playing by Heart"". When I saw her in the second movie, I was stuck by her incredible beauty. Then I began to hear of her in the news constantly and before I knew it, she was my new favorite actress. When I saw ""Gia,"" I already had great expectations and she did not disappoint me. The film was powerful, raw, heart-wrenching and I found myself cringing in horror at the end, but Angelina did a spectacular job of making it seem so real and believable. You tend to forget the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" and focus on Carangi's story as if you were actually there instead of just viewing a movie. YOU HAVE to see this movie!"
5,5 Stars for Gia!,"The movie Gia was like no other movie, I loved it! It's been out for many years but I only found out about it not long ago. Watch it you will never forget Gia."
5,Angelina Jolie:THE BEST actress on this planet.,"Angelina is THE most talented actress I've ever seen. She is the most beautiful human being alive! Her acting...man oh man is it so believable. She has those certain looks that make you wanna scream. D@rn, I wish I was her!I idolize her!"
4,Mesmerizing Tale of Fame and Self-destruction,"This is really an excellent film and it rightly catapulted Jolie to stardom. Her performance here is outstanding. If this had not been an HBO film, she probably would have won an Oscar. It is a beautifully filmed gut-wrenching story. Not for the prudish certainly, but for those heartier souls, this is a real winner."
2,A Disappointment.,"Well, it looks like I definitely have a contrarian opinion here because so many amazonians loved ""Gia,"" but I simply could not get into this movie even though I watched the entire thing. Due to its weak plot and characterization, I don't know if we can really make a statement regarding Jolie's acting talents. There's not much that she could have done with such a stunted role. It is profoundly difficult to form any type of attachment to Gia. She's just not someone you can feel empathy for.I will grant that many of the party and sex scenes are magnetic, but, despite their visual interest, they are in no way a legitimate substitute for a meaningful plot. With the lesbian scenes, I understand why the movie caused a stir, but it seems to me that, if one is interested in such things, there are more direct and uniform sources from which to derive these pleasures. At every level, ""Gia"" just doesn't work."
3,so so,"I'm a sucker for a pretty face, so wanted to see this because Gia was so beautiful. Angelina Jolie isn't quite as beautiful, but certainly attractive. As tabloid readers know, Jolie is an emotional wreck of a person, so that's probably why she plays this role so effectively! One of my boyhood friends played the small part of Gia's girl friend's boy friend. Hey, Reggie, it was fun to see you on the screen! Wish the part had been bigger! Anyway, the movie kind of dragged. But I love beautiful women, so I liked looking at the movie for that alone."
4,4 stars for Angelina's nice bod,"WOW.... That's all I can say. Go for it guys. You may well react the same way. But if you really want to see how good of an actress Angelina Jolie could be, watch ""Girl, Interrupted""."
3,Hold Your Horses!,"Geeez! Calm down everybody! This movie is ALL RIGHT. Gia is very entertaining to watch, but it cannot hold a candle to any really good drama. The themes of this film appeal to a broad audience and are dealt with in a very straightforward manner, so it's no wonder that so many viewers highly ranked this movie. If you are a true connoisseur of film, however, I'd skip this flick."
5,Gia,"Have you ever been so lonely and bored that drinking or smoking or altering your state of mind seems like a good idea? Gia argues against that thought. Remarkably anti-drug, it features harrowing scenes of drug use, complete with infected heroin needles, popping veins, and even scarier depictions of the way drugs affect our mind and emotions. Based on the life of the late 80's supermodel/lesbian/heroin addict/AIDS victim, Gia Carangi (Angelina Jolie) this HBO film can't be so much labeled as an ""issue"" movie, although it clearly encompasses themes of anti-drug, anti-modeling industry, pro-gay, pro-AIDS awareness, and covers them more powerfully and with more artism than most films can do with just one of those heavy topics. When the tragic ending comes, Gia casts a dark, powerful spell. Kudos to Angelina Jolie and especially Elizabeth Mitchell as Gia's caring lover, Linda, now a near vet on playing lesbians."
1,Exploits women,"Just shows how the modeling industry and then hollywood loves to exploit women and treat them like objects. Terrible in the fact that something like this also makes girls feel bad if they do not look like a model. Shallow idiocy that is again, praised by hollywood who cannot stop making money on this woman's death. Jolie is an actress of immense proportions (no pun intended) but I am surprised she took the role."
1,A biography about someone you could care less about.,Contemporary Hollywood loves movies about poor misunderstood actresses and models who resort to drugs/sex/drugs because their lives are so difficult in the fast lane. Someone once said write what you know so Hollywood gives us are these types of stories (at least this one doesn't have a hooker as the lead character!). It is convincingly played by the actors but one gets the idea the parts are not really much of a stretch for them. Additional nude lesbian scenes were added to the video version which pretty much says it all.
1,Overrated in a big way,"This movie was insultingly bad. I saw it before I knew anything about it and was shocked to hear it's gotten so much critical acclaim. My sister - 16 and a usual fan of AJ - and I happened on it on HBO and couldn't stop laughing at it. (It's not a comedy). It was trying to be all deep and glamourous, but we thought it was pretentious and silly. If you want to see a movie about drugs messing with people's lives, try Sid and Nancy, High Art, Train Spotting or Drugstore Cowboy, not this."
2,HBO Acting,"This movie was bad. The acting was horrible. Merecedes Rhuel who played Gia's mother was like a cartoon character. The only good performance was by the blonde girlfriend (Elizabeth Mitchell). The whole thing just reeked of a made-for-HBO movie.Fine for a late night hotel tv watch. Also, the Terrence Blanchard jazz soundtrack was pretty good. Otherwise, a PASS."
4,Not bad at all.....,"Angelina does a fine job at portraying a drug addict going down the wroing road in life when a person has lots of ""assets"" --lots of nudity---lots of emotions , not bad---"
3,Angelina isn't Just a Pretty Face,"I have to give this an ""A"" for the acting...especially Angelina. As for the movie's story...well...not so much impressed with that. Thought they used the story to show more ""skin""...so to speak. Personally thought the story line was hyped..but I have ""no"" real insight into this sort of world.The acting was superb...just didn't care for the story so this didn't get a 5 star in my mind's eye."
5,WOW,This movie was really good. I cannot believe how much Angelina looks like Gia. SHe did an awesome job capturing Gia's image and personality. This was a graphic movie but it really showed the emotion behind all the pain and sucess of Gia's life.
5,Amazing Movie,Angelina Jolie is the BEST actress I have seen in a long time. Gia was an amazing movie and anyone who has not seen it should. Angelinas perfect as Gia. Anyone who has seen the movie should read the book. The movie is amazing the book is amazing on a different level.
3,The most Angelina you're going to see,"Very good acting, especially by Angelina, but not exactly the most entertaining plot. I really only purchased it for my huge-Angelina-fan wife but even she wasn't all that impressed by it.Lots of Angelina-nudity would be reason enough for some people to buy it, but my advice would be to hire it before deciding to purchase it."
4,"Strong performances, tragic story","This tale of the fashion industry, and how it uses, abuses, and discards its participants, features strong performances. First, Angelina Jolie, as the brassy, sassy, and ultimately pitiful figure of Gia, as well as Mercedes Ruehl, as her mother, and others, make this a tragic tale of a girl, who makes it big; then self-destructs, facing what was then the largely unknown disease which was, and still is, Aids. Not for everyone but a good movie. There is an unrated version; which I'm not sure what more could be added, as this ""R"" rated one features quite a bit of controversial material (Nudity, Lesbianism, Drug Use). Not a upbeat movie but a moral fable for modern times."
4,Angelina Jolie,Wow! What an actress! Angelina Jolie was magnificent in this role. She was very convincing and amazing. I could see this again and again.
4,I want Angelina Jolie ALL TO MYSELF!,"She is so believable as a supermodel! And it's also believable that a heterosexual woman could find her attractive as well, as she's possesses a tough-yet-vulnerable eroticism that I found irresistable! Her love scenes with that other woman were done so very well, I wanted more more more! Of course, the tragic ending was expected, but it only added to what is an excellent telling of Gia's rise & fall. I just hope Angelina Jolie's career doesn't mirror Gia's, as she is just TOO HOT! I want her BAD!"
4,Gia movie,It's always good to learn history. I never new about this person because i was stationed overseas with the Air Force when this was taking place.
5,Actress in Bloom,A perfect opportunity for a young Ms.Jolie to show her then acting ability to everyone with an intence role of living life in the fast lane based on a true story of a model called Gia. She later moved on to become a widly popularly wanted actress.
5,Awesome,"I really liked this movie. It told a story about a women that not a whole lot of people knew about. It's a story about a women who came from nothing to being everything she ever wanted. She had to deal with the up sand downs of stardom, and eventaully got stuck on the downs. Its a great story."
3,Fun & Engaging,"Angelina Jolie is brilliant in this film - it depicts the meteoric rise and fall of a fashion model, as well as the way she was seen by people in different parts of her life. I really enjoyed this a lot for what it was - a biographical morality tale of too much success and too little judgment. And, Angelina Jolie is freakin' hot!"
5,Gia,"America's first supermodel Gia Carangi lives hard and dies young in the glamorous, excessive urban wilds of 1970s New York City. The movie takes you deeper and deeper into a personality you feel you are part of, but are scared to become. This is a story with love, hatred, pain, joy, and many other emotions. Gia is superbly acted by Angelina Jolie, who captivates the true escence that the real Gia once had. I recomend this movie highly."
5,Warning: This movie is Intense.,"It's the type of movie that once you see it you can't unsee it, you know? It stays with you. Angelina Jolie was amazing, I absolutely fell in love with her. I felt so apart of what was happening, I felt that I knew Gia and I cared about what she did. I'm sorry, my review isn't as good and deep as everyone else's, all I can say is when the movie was over I felt like I lost a friend. Even now, days after seeing the movie, I feel like someone special was lost.I recommend buying this movie. I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible."
3,Angelina Jolie makes this movie,"Angelina Jolie is the only good thing about this movie. The writing is sub-par, the story is simple, and not to mention it's a TV movie, so not much money went in to making it interesting to watch.However, if you like Angelina Jolie, like I do, then you will like this movie. It showcases her body above her acting ability, but she still makes this movie 3 stars instead of 1."
3,gia,"i would'nt buy it if giventhe chance again. it's okay to rent, but i would'nt watch it a second time."
5,This is an excellent portrayal of realities we don't usually,I think this was an excellant movie about the realities of being a super-model that we don't usually get to see. Every now and again we hear about this or that model being addicted to drugs but it is usually kept hush hush. I was very moved when I saw this movie on HBO and have looked high and low for a placeto buy it. I'm glad that I have found it.
5,Absolutely amazing!,"If anyone ever saw Gia, then you need not wonder why it was Angelina Jolie's breakthrough movie! She was absolutely fabulous in this movie and her supporting cast was just as amazing! this movie captures you with the beauty of the lead actress, but holds you with the wonderful telling of Gia's rise and fall from grace. the film makers were not afraid to show the graphic side of a dying aids patient, which shows viewers that aids can even claim a strong beautiful supermodel, such as Gia. i would recommend this movie to anyone who claims to be a movie lover."
4,UHHHH...JOLIE FROM A NEW ANGLE,"WELL, I DIDN 'T LIKE THE MOVIE, BUT I ORDERED IT, AND IT GOT HERE REALLY FAST. AND WAS AS DESCRIBED IN THE PACKAGE. BUT WISH I HAD NOT ORDERED IT. THE MOVIE WAS A DUD. NOT A BAD WORD ABOUT SUPPLIER OR SHIPPER THOUGH."
5,Gia,"I had never heard about this movie until I caught the last hour of it on tv. one Saturday evening late. I had missed alot of it and the ending got cut off due to time and I knew I had to see the entire movie, so I ordered it from Amazon. I received it within a week and watched it that night. It is a sad story but is so well written and acted that it makes it a great movie. Angelina Jolie plays Gia's character and does an amazing job portraying her. Except for the very beginning, I felt as though I was watching Gia rather than Angelina Jolie. I lent it to my sister who watched it several times and loved it and she too had never heard of the movie. I would highly reccommend it to any adult with the caveat that it is not an uplifting movie, but very real and is about a model's life."
4,Beautiful but.......,"This movie is great in all seirousness, the story lines are good, the actors are too and, in addition, it's a true story. Not being a fan of Angie, I was sceptical at the idea of watching taht movie but I bought it for my girl and I liked it a lot.The but comes from the fact taht the lesbian story isn't quite plausible, I must admit that Gia was addicted to affection as much as drugs. The fact taht she goes back to the same girl even if she rejected her is possible but taht many times.... I doubt it.But on a general overview, taht movie is a masterpiece! I recommand it to anyone who wants to cry (you get attach to the main character)"
3,Who knew?,"In this true life portrayal of Gia Marie Carangi's life, Angeline Jolie lays the ground work for her monumental arrival to the big screen. I think with this film, Jolie establishes herself as the most courageous actress to grace the scene in quite some time. On another note, it's sad that someone as beautiful as Gia Carangi struggled with so many demons. You never know what's going on in someone's mind. In any event, Angelina Jolie is magnificent!"
3,Great,"This unrated virsion of Gia was amazing,,there was so much extra footage that i have never seen before..This edition shows more in depht sight on how Gia""s life was!"
5,The Best Movie of the decade,Great movie with real acting. Angelina Jolie was remarkable and it shows (she won a golden globe) Great movie see it it will make you realize many things.
5,Angelina Jolie at her best!,"I veiwed this ""movie"" about 5 months ago, and I must say that it was a superb movie. First of all, Angelina Jolie was perfect for the part, infact her acting was so real, I was almost feeling how she felt. Second, I had no idea that this was a true story when I had seen it. While I was watching it, I thought it was very sad and entertaining, but when I found out that EVERYTHING in the film was true, I wa shocked. And third, the story is so touching and tragic at times. I know guys don't cry, but I almost did at the very en when Gia found out she had aids and couldn' tell her girlfrind, Linda. This was a great story and it showd that people who are beautiful can't always have beauty and happiness at the same time. To sum it all up...it was FANTASTIC! A MUST SEE!"
4,File This One With the Depresso Movies,"This is an excellent film. Well acted, well thought-out. It's steamy in some places, emotionally gripping in others. There's a lot being said here, and none of it is terribly uplifting, especially since it's based in a true story. This movie will leave you thoughtful, maybe even introspective, but most of all you'll just be depressed. A bottle of wine and a sink to soak your head in afterwards are a couple of good ideas here....."
4,tragic,"great work done by angelina. she is captivating, of course I had to watch more than once. great performance."
3,"Angelina Jolie, Topless.","The movie is OK, not the greatest. But you do get to see Angelina without a shirt, running and jumping into a chainlink fence. A little bit odd scene, could have done without the fence part. I liked Hackers a little bit better than this one."
4,The first U.K. single off The Sophtware Slump.,"Track 1 is the album version. Track 2, Our Dying Brains, is a must-have for serious collectors; Jason says the song is ""really old"" on the grandaddylandscape website. (Song also available in the States on the CMJ New Music Monthly sampler disc for October 2000, Vol. 86.) Track 3 is also most excellent. Band site describes it as ""probably one of the best songs that Jason's written in a long time."" The title here is: First Movement/Message Send: ID#5646766. (Exact same song also available in the States, under the track name ""Sarah 5646766,"" from the band's D.I.Y. compilation The Windfall Varietal.) Packaging is lovely collage; totally worth it just for the art."
4,Great songwriting and earnest vocals make it a classic,"There's something about the way these songs flow together with the open, indie-rock production technique m`1aking the drums sound roomy and the guitars jangly with angelic vocals above everytning in the mix. This is sonically the best record these guys have done fropm an engineers standpoint. As a fan, It would be hard for these guys to do any wrong on a record and this is no exception."
4,Pretty Good,"Although Transatlanticism is the best DCFC album, this album is tied for second (with We Have the Facts). The production is noticeably different here than on any of the previous Death Cab albums. Ben Gibbard's vocals are now crisper and not so reliant on buried reverb and echo. The drums are also louder, faster, and in the forefront. The Photo Album has a very ""rock"" feel to it and it suits the band very well. ""We Laugh Indoors"" is a perfect example: this song has the trademark DCFC arpeggios, harmonic casiotone, strained vocals, perfect notes, but it now has BIG drums to prove its point. This album is a fantastic, compelling listen (even its flaws), and is well worth your time."
5,Fantastic,What a wonderful album! The music is very moody and the lyrics are absolutely vivid... esp. Styrofoam Plates. Wow!
4,Good indie music.,"These guys may not be the best indie/emo band ever (Sunny Day Real Estate holds that honor), but hey, at least they're not sellouts like The Strokes and Dashboard Confessional. Definiatly worth checking out, and worth the money you'll spend on it. If you like Jimmy Eat World, the Eels, or New End Original, then you'd probably this CD as well. Also, if you are so starved for good music that you like The Strokes, this might be a good introduction to the simillar-sounding indie bands that are a million times better. Key songs include ""A Movie Script Ending,"" ""Why You'd Want to Live Here,"" and ""Styfofoam Plates,"" but you can still listen to this without skipping any tracks."
1,picture book,"this album is absolutely no comparison to the last two. the lyrics are not nearly as savvy and quirky (steadier footing is as close as they get), the repetition is uninteresting and irritating (enough about guenivere already) and the ""deep"" song on the album (styrofoam plates) is trite and embarrassing. i am a huge fan of this fab band, but this is a boring album."
3,Not as good as I thought...,"I really hate writing reviews that are honest, but the new DCFC album is not even close to their past two efforts. While I think the song Los Angeles is awesome and akin to efforts by ""X"" and ""Frank Black"" as panning this city, (especially the line about the smoggy air and smell in the air one notices you step off a plane at LAX), I feel the album is over-produced, (though clean sounding for those who like this) and less inspired than Something About Airplanes (which is the best release).Still an up-and-coming band from a new Seattle scene and worthy of a listen."
5,Simply Beautiful,"This is the only Death Cab Album I own, and it is very good. The music is so amazing. These guys have real talent. But this CD is definatly not for everybody. The music is Indie Rock, and some people think this sort of thing sucks. I don't, but if you are one of those people that listens to mainstream emo and the stuff that is only on the radio, you probably won't like this. It is underground Indie, which means that Death Cab will not be played on the radio anytime soon, or sell out. So if you are a fan of this genre already, get the CD."
3,Go to THE POSTAL SERVICE FULL TIME,Death Cab is some decent stuff.......but it's not as refreshing as The Postal Service. I wish Ben Gibbard would make Death Cab his side project and do The Postal Service thing full time. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is unmatched by any Death Cab song.Adios
2,Subpar at best...,"This album was most certianly less than spectacular, boring, repetative, melancholy, there were only two tracks that I cared to hear more than once(#3&7), and those were nothing too special. Even girls I let listen to it didn't like it, and with this genre of music if that's true then there's no reason to waste your time or money on it. Thank god I didn't buy it cause it really would have turned me off of DCFC's music which I have really grown fond of. This album just doesn't deserve much praise and I don't entend on giving it..."
5,Family Pendant,"Bought this necklace as a gesture to my girlfriend when our families blended last year.She is horrible about necklaces, would rather opt to wear them everyday without ever taking them off to clean them, UGH!I managed to get it away from her and needless to say, almost a year of constant wear hasn't really bothered it so much."
3,An interesting read.,"Although the book was well written and somewhat entertaining, it wasn't what I was expecting. Rather than being a manual filled with ""techniques"" it is more about the psychology of why men pay to see escorts. If you are interested in that, then this book is a very good one. If you are looking for detailed ""how-too's"" its not."
5,Excellent Book!,"When I was in middle school my mom decided it was time I learned about relationships. She bought me ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" (another great book), and she bought herself this book. She ended up trying to throw it away, where I found it. It has been one of the best and most informative books I have ever read.A lot of what this book is about is actually not sex, but the psychology of sex. Reading this book really helped me to understand men as a whole, and I feel that many of my relationships have been better as a result. I would recommend this book to any woman who wants to have a meaningful relationship."
2,"Mostly lame and poorly written, but...","For writing, this book deserves ONE star. It's so bad. I actually looked up Monet on line and read a few of her essays and they were okay, so I suspect she was on a time crunch without a strong editor. For content, I'd rate around 3 stars... that is, if you can set aside that creepy feeling that she doesn't quite understand she was an escort. As an example, while she has a point that women don't always let their intelligence be part of what makes them sexy (as I'm sure many of us have seen our female friends dumb themselves down in front of certain men), Monet misses an opportunity to observe that men have reason to flatter her. What is that cliché -- beautiful women want to be told they're smart and smart women want to be told they're beautiful? ...She also glosses over how men are not going to act the same towards an escort as they are around women they see every day. That being said, this book seems to contain valid male-pleasing advice."
2,A little to literal with breadth but no depth,"The book starts well but fails to really deliver on the details. The book feels like a large survey of topics: personal hygiene; sex; love; and orgasms. No single topic is really addressed in great detail and often times there are very literal examples or courses of action one should take in the matters of seduction.If you have read text dedicated to seduction, sex, orgasms, and relationships or have found yourself in midway through the course of a examined life, I would say that this book comes across as too simple and too literal. You, the reader, will likely feel bored. However, I feel as though this would make a decent primer for girls leaving adolescence with a number of unanswered questions."
2,the cover is the best part?,"Kind of a snoozer, despite at times reading like a pep rally. Wait till the price goes down."
5,Gabba Gabba Hey,"What can a die-hard Ramones say? I need shock therapy after watching this video. Or maybe I should sniff some glue... Well, Ramones fans will love this very personal video, shot from a camcorder. Reminds me of meeting the band in person. No hi-fi professional quality video here, but that's what the Ramones are: raw, in your face punk rock. I recommend this video to all pinheads around the world."
2,alternative,I was considering this item on Amazon and happend to see the low cost of wireless pushbutton remotes that would work for my gate opener. I bought a couple and mounted one using velcro inside a low profile waterproof outlet box I attached to the house in a discrete location. A few more $ but no wiring required.
5,Great Product,"This was a great product and just as described. I received this item right own , time and it was used just as they described.."
4,enjoyable read,this book is a fun read as was Humberto Fontanva's companion book Hell Diver's Rodeo. He does repeat himself in the two books but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of reading.
5,A great video on a great ukemi system...,"Donovan Waite Sensei has definately got this Ukemi system down. This set (ukemi 1 & 2) from Aikido Today Magazine aka aiki.com has really helped me in improving my falling techniques. This tape has less ""step here"", ""turn here"", but more explanation of what is expected on both Uke and Nage to learn good ukemi. A five star rating from this viewer. Good Job!"
1,What on earth was THAT?,"Frank Vignola--a classy, mainstream guitarist. Or crass purveyor of cheesy fusion? As with Kenny Garrett's recent outings, this is a disc likely to blindside anyone who's liked Vignola's tasteful traditional guitar-playing in the past. If peppy synth-laden grooves are your thing, however, dig in. Most jazz fans will hate this kind of sonic glurge with a passion, though."
5,futurejazzdowntempoambient whatever,"some amazing tracks, a few dogs - prozac with a beat - get a minimal groove on in a non invasive, unobtrusive way."
4,Informative and helpful.... and that is an understatement,"This book was amazing informative and helped to pass the exam to become a certified computer technician. I already knew how to troubleshoot but I had no idea about some of the specifics that the book gave. I never knew that addresses for hardware were so complicated, but the book pointed them out and made it easy to remember what was what."
2,bad clasp,"I was a little disappointed when this watch arrived. It is the size and heft of a man's watch!! I'm used to Anne Klein watches being very feminine, not masculine. I also had a problem with the clasp just spontaneously opening....A LOT! Finally, a link simply fell out of the band one day, and I decided to send it for the repairs, under warranty. The watch was returned very quickly, but the clasp still came undone with little or no provocation. I sent it back again, and this time the clasp stays fastened about 80% of the time. It is a striking watch, but too big and not worth the hassle."
4,wonderfully romantic,"This movie was so romanitic, that it made you wish Julia Roberts would have gotten the man."
3,Different but not especially good,"The Bottom Line:Though this 1997 Julia Roberts vehicle gets points for not following the oh-so-tired romantic comedy formula, My Best Friend's Wedding's willingness to go outside the norm unfortunately leaves it without a satisfying ending; it may be a commendable film, but it's not a very funny or rewarding one.2.5/4"
4,classic Rom-com,"If you're a fan of romantic comedies, this one should definitely make your list. Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz are both charming. There isn't much soppy romance, just a lot of amusing scenes, mostly featuring Roberts behaving somewhat outlandishly. The movie doesn't drag on, and just generally fun. Recommended.Roberts flies to Chicago to try and stop an ex from marrying Cameron Diaz. It's obviously a poor plan, but it's funny to watch.If you don't like romantic comedies, obviously, skip it!"
1,The Decline and Fall of the Holywood Romance,"Who is everyone kidding? There are no heart-felt feelings, no deep stirrings of the human soul. The lack of true romance is best demonstrated when Evert arrives in Chicago and he has a conversation with Roberts. The question comes up - did he come see her for a ""quick f__k"". (And this movie is rated PG-13???) Kids in junior high have more intelligence than this. The movie is just vapid Hollywood nonsense. If you want a great Hollywood romance, try ""The Awful Truth"" or ""It Happened One Night"". Both of these movies were made long before I was born, but have enduring qualities. ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" will justly fade into oblivion before too long."
4,Lots of fun,"Jules Potter is in love with her bdest friend Micheal, but he is about to marry someone else. Jules will do anything to mess up his big day. This movie is loads of fun and laughs. When they break out into song in one scene, you can't help but sing along. I love this movie and watch it often. It's one of my favorites with Roberts next to Pretty Woman."
1,This movie is awful!,"I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen! No action, no comedy. I think it has a lousy story!!!"
5,My girl Julia,"Julia Roberts is simply ""hilarious"" in this film. If you are not a fan of Julia, then you should definitely try this film. You will begin to appreciate her more."
4,My Best Friends's Wedding,"I love this movie. I am a helpless romantic and this movie is funny and just that, a romatic comedy. I watch it over and over.Julia and Cameron fit together!!!!!"
3,MAWKISH SITCOM WITH A BOUQUET OF RANDOM WARBLINGS,"The best things one could say about this breeze-light romantic 'comedy' (ahem) are that it does not make any pretense of being what is clearly isn't (it's simply a J.Roberts vehicle and behaves like one) or that it probably ranks high on the Top Date-Movies list.Other than that, it's the hackneyed chickflick refrain -- she loves him, must get him, must break marriage, jealousy, hate, forgiveness, yada, and then some yada. There are moments so screwball they feel contrived and insipid.Rupert Everett is perhaps the one and only saviour who infuses life into the sap, but in the end he has less than a pivotal role. Not even random bursts of music (Diaz in a karaoke; or a huffed chorus of teenage boys getting high; or Rupert Everett breaking into a tune) can save the movie from being a trudge of girlie gook.Unless of course you enjoy films like Notting Hill or Wedding Planner, in which case this may be right up your alley."
4,When reality hits,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I related to Juliann most of the way. In fact, I guessed most of what she did, some she didn't. It was an eye opener. Sometimes we don't realize what we have in our backyard until it's too late. Very funny, fast paced, not to mention, some very good looking people. The ""singing"" table scene was a bit far fetched, however, very humourous indeed. Be careful with who you watch this with. When I watched it with an ""ex""boyfriend, he was surprised I had such a devious mind. Sit back, relax and enjoy some great laughs. Oh, some might want to have a kleenex close by, just in case."
4,Very tasty and delicious movie,"I got it on DVD and I don't think that one time is enough for watching it .. I liked the story, the acting and the music .. but I didn't like the ending much .. Joly had enogh of friendship with Michel and she didn't need a new friend (George) .. she needed a man that she can think as a husband .."
5,My Favorite...by far,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's very sweet from beginning to end. Julia Roberts plays Juliana, a former tomboy who finds out her best friend Michael (Dermott Mulroony) is getting married to a younger woman, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz). Juliana then realizes she's in love with Michael and tries to stop the wedding. It's a fun movie with romance mixed with comedy. It reallymakes you cry at the end. If you like Notting Hill, you'll love this too!"
3,My Best Friend's Wedding,Movie was cute and I only bought it because I'm a HUGE Dermot Mulroney fan. I didn't like this as much as the Wedding Date.
3,Reliable Classic Chick Flick,"This film has become a classic in the contempory girl orientated romantic comedy genre we know as the chick flick. I watched it again, for the first time in ages, recently and I genuinley can't remember many movies of its kind that show such honesty. Julia Roberts is brilliant, and I loved seeing her in a character that wasn't oozing charm and lovliness, and whose opinions weren't always correct. Cameron Diaz was breaking slowly into Hollywood around this time, and this film was a clear example of just why she is so succesful. Maybe I'm being a little harsh only rating it as a 3, but to be honest it isn't one of my favourite ever films. However, it is a film that pleases you with its deserved ending and will always be a well known girlie movie."
3,An okay movie but not a Julia Roberts best.,I had expected better... I was disappointed. It wasnt a bad movie it just fell short of my expectations. Julia Roberts groveling doesnt strike a note of truth with me and so it left me feeling like the whole thing was even fakier than fiction should be.
3,ANOTHER ROMANTIC COMEDY,"Ever since the delightful FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL came to set the new fashion for modern romantic comedies of our time,producers have tried to duplicate its success often in vain.The freshness of it's appeal is not recreated here;this is mainly another tailor made part for JULIA.The parody of DIONNE WARWICK in the early days did not make me laugh;i was rather annoyed by it, because i love those old BURT BACHARACH songs,but ok,after all this is a comedy.If you care, the song THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT was written by DOROTHY FIELDS and set to music by JEROME KERN in 1936.What was the name of that actress again? ANDIE MCDOWELL the L'OREAL girl.Gee whiz ,i miss her.Am i the only one for god's sake?"
4,The True Work of a Masterpiece,"Julia Roberts may not have been able to steal the heart of the groom, but she sure did steal the audiences' hearts. This romantic comedy is funny and touching. Not just Roberts, but the entire cast is surely working at their best during this film. I love this movie, and I never get tired of watching it over and over. If you are a fan of movies like Runaway Bride, Ghost, etc., then make sure that you at least rent this movie for yourself."
1,Just a comedy but scary what it says about women in the '90s,"This movie really bothered me. I like romantic comedies, I liked Pretty Woman, but this movie just played like it was written by a man who thinks he knows women well...but doesn't. Why do we have to see Julia Roberts falling apart because she's not married? why the implication that if she didn't take her job so seriously (more ""wifely"") she would be happier? why the implication that Cameron Diaz, the one who gets the guy, has made the better decision, to quit college and her dreams of being an architect to get married? (why would she need to quit working anyway even if she did get married? why does her future spouse want her to do so?) If social subtexts don't bother you enjoy this movie but if you can't quite turn off the reality meter then give this one a miss."
3,Enjoyable with some Great Moments,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie had some exccellent moments (the resaurant scene, the bread truck scene, etc.); some of them funny, some of them serious. I thought the movie drifted off and on every once and awhile and had such a potential to do more, but didn't. It's enjoyable, if you don't mind the occasional lulls."
3,Not My Best Friend,"The opening credits (""Wishin' and Hopin'"") and Rupert Everett are the only reasons to watch this movie. Everett not only looks good but is sympathetic and witty. The only word for the other male star is ""dumb."" He looks dumb, he sounds dumb, he acts dumb.There's a truly awful scene in which Cameron Diaz does a karaoke rendition of ""I Say a Little Prayer for You,"" humiliating herself and everyone else except her dumb fiance, who thinks she's adorable. Why Julia Roberts would have had the slightest interest in this guy is a mystery that is never solved."
3,Pretty decent for a chick flick,"I normally don't do the romantic comedy thing. And I am not a fan of Julia Roberts. But this film wasn't all that bad. It has a good pace and did keep my interest for most of it. It doesn't follow the normal 'formula', if you will,of the typical romantic comedy movie and sort of leaves you guessing. The acting is good, I could even stand Julia Roberts. Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett have great supporting roles and are both a blast to watch in this.All in all, a decent comedy with a few good moments and not as predictable as most."
5,funny as sh&*t!!!!!!,1997 couldnt of happened without this movie!!! funny!! Julia Roberts and Camron Diaz are great in this film!!! Must have!! I cant believe its almost 10 years since it came out. Feels like yesterday when i first saw it.
1,Hard to be disappointed when one expects nothing to begin wi,"One of the wonderful things about film, is its unpredictability. Many times one looks toward a film like My Best Friend's Wedding and says: Formula (or worse) comedy, vapid performance by one of film's lesser talented and marginally attractive female leads, wedged within too many audience `treats'--weak, shallow set pieces using topical humor-so topical that they stale by the time of video release, only to be pleasantly surprised by a smart, strong film with good writing and strong performances.This is not one of those times.Bad idea, cheap casting and sanguine script combine with today's studio formulation to make an indistinguishable mess.Not surprisingly, this movie will make the career of Cameron Diaz, revive the career of Julia Roberts, establish the career of Rupert Everett, and kill the career of Dermot Mulroney.At 105 mins probably 100 or so too long..............Next..........."
1,"Love Julia & Cameron, hated the movie.","Unlike the other reviews, I thought the movie was a downer with a point of view problem. At the beginning of the movie, one has the impression that there is hope for renewal. Then she is mean and calculating with Cameron's character, and was put in the humiliating situation of chasing after her best friend, only to lose out. I say thumbs down!"
3,Great Book - Poor Construction,"My 1.5 year old son LOVES this book. I am giving it three stars because of its construction. I don't let my son read this book on his own because he is pretty destructive. But even with my gentle operation, some of the slide and seek wheels are stuck and require careful manipulation to get them to work."
4,About Charmed 5th season DVDs,At last this season. Can't wait for the last ones. Sure is a good acquisition.
5,Charmed,"Have the complete series, loved Charmed when it originally aired. Find it hard to find TV shows that hold my attention like these characters and episodes did. Everyone deserves a little magic in today's world."
5,Awesome,"I rarely watch TV so I missed the entire Charmed series when it originally aired. I recently purchased the entire series in the Book of Shadows edition. I love the Book of Shadows packaging but the packaging has the negative side effect of damaging a disc or two. Season 5 was particularly damaged so I purchased the season separately for “clean” copies. I cannot say yet which is my favorite season but I can say that each season is off the charts good and each season seems to be better than the one before. The show engages my emotions at every level, I laugh, I cry, I am filled with awe and wonder. I cannot recommend a television series more highly. Charmed is the best."
4,Mixed Season,"A witch's tail, part 1- 4/10A witch's tail, part 2- 5/10Happily ever after- 6/10siren song- 4/10Witches in tights- 7/10the eyes have it- 5/10sympathy for the demon- 6/10A witch in time- 9/10Sam I am- 8/10Y Tu mummy tambien- 4/10The importance of being Phoebe- 6/10Centennial Charmed- 8/10House Call- 4/10Sand Francisco Dreamin'- 7/10the day the magic died- ?baby's first demon- 4/10lucky charmed- ?cat house- 9/10nymphs just want to have fun- 7/10sense and sense ability- 5/10necromancing the stone- 6/10oh my goddess, part one- 8/10oh my goddess, part two- 8/10"
5,Charmed Season Five is Great!,"It is exactly what you expect, but with a hint of surprise. With the death of the all mighty Cole, the show just isn't the same. Piper finally gets pregnant and is expecting a girl, from when she went to the future. Though when the baby is born it turns out SHE is a HE!!! Paige is, of course, super-witch and learns she must tone it down. All in all, Charmed has always been great in the past, and is great in the Fifth Season, I mean it!!!"
4,I wish I was Charmed,I have loved the Charmed series from the beginning and have seen each of the series at least 3 to 4 times. I am buying the sets for the future when they are no longer on TV.
4,Season 5,"Season 5 was probably the most sad season of them all. One because Cole is finally vanquish and Leo becomes an Elder leaving the sister alone. One good thing is Wyatt's born and, in the final episodes, Chris's Future self shows up. This season would probably have to be the most magical season of them. I'm talking mermaids, leprechauns, dwarfs, fairy tales, and whatnot. And Paige gets a visit from two important ""relatives"" she's never met and has to decided if she has room in her heart for anymore family, can guess?? lol I'll give you a hint, she has already met her mother, who else is there?. You'll know the answer to this if you're a true fan like me.All in all this season hasn't been the most entertaining, but it was interesting."
3,Charmed Seasons 4,I love Charmed. I have all the seasons but the fourth one i found kinda boring because of the departure of Prue and the entering of Paige. Season four didn't really tie together as well as seasons 1-3 did. I thought season four was scatered and didn't really make a lot of sense. I watched everysingle episode of Charmed seasons 1-8 and would have to say season four was my least liked.
4,Charmed: A new kind of Season,"Charmed Season 5 gets a lot of mixed reviews. I am a die-hard Charmed fan so I try to look at the best things. I feel that as much as I loved Cole by this point I was sick of him, I wanted Cole and Phoebe to live happily ever after...but then again he was evil. Paige becomes more powerful and Piper and Leo final get their child from the future...although it is a boy. I didn't like a lot of the baby episodes I felt they could have done with better story lines but I loved the arrival of Wyatt and of course Victor marrying a demon."
5,Charmed The Complete Fifth Season,This is my all-time favorite tv show. I hate that it is no longer on tv. I will miss it.
5,"Latin music lovers watchout, this is a great CD","I became a fan of Tito and Latin music after listening to this wonderfully ecclectic CD. Being a musician myself, I was in awe of the great players and Tito's leadership. The beats are fantastic, guaranteed to move you. Buy it, and try it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"
4,Fun dance collection,This collection is a lot of fun percussion with typical Latin mambo beats. It's got enough variety to keep you interested but it's still pretty easy listening. A fun addition to anyone's dance collection.
2,Slow down..,Looking at the others reviews I sincerely think you were too much generous or you don't know the music of Tito. I bought this CD and I was desapointed for the lack of energy authenticity by the quality of the arrangements.This is not a bad CD but the oldies are FAR BETTER.
5,The Night Marchers II The Best Hawaiian Movie Ever Made!,"For a low budget movie the Cousins Brothers do a terific job in making an epic Hawaiian based legend brought to life! The special effects look like any other Big Budget Hollywood production! The vast landscapes provided by The Big Island Backdrop is just Stunning. Night Marchers II povideds Chills, Thrills, and a few laughs Its fun for the whole Family.I cant wait for Night Marchers III!"
5,"Moving, marvelous reading","A most moving, thoughtful, disarmingly candid, disarmingly honest perusal of what it was to grow with an immigrant father apparently deffective in every respect, however full of love for a son both as he was and as he came to be, almost a dissection of human emotions yet a most loving one; we share the awe, mixed love-shame and adventure of the author in discovering the scope of what is a human being and what a human being can be, as he uncovers a past ultimately bountiful with the reward for him of overcoming hindrances and prejudices in a new world. I don't think the author aimed to show this, but by overcoming hindrances and prejudice he ends gaining his own rightful place in that new world and in the process makes his father triumph. The book, and the journey, is a triumph of the human spirit."
3,Something was missing,"I started reading the book and was thrilled by the content and writing style. It started out very strongly talking about his adult mental illness and then went back to his childhood dominated by loss. I could vividly picture Jewish New york for those in poverty. Although the childhood story was powerful and beautifully written, I was shocked that at the end it left too many unanswered questions about his life."
4,On the Road: Live '92,Five track EP:1. KOOL-AID*2. CAN'T WAIT3. INNOCENT CHILD4. CONTACT5. RUSHRecorded live at The Ritz in NYC 4/24/92(except * recorded by WXRT live atThe Riviera Theatre in Chicago 10/5/91)
3,OK Taste/ chocolate chip brownie better,"The Myoplex Carb Control Bars provide me with what I am looking for - a good ratio of protein and carb. These taste good; however, the chocolate chip brownie are better."
3,Nutrition Bars,My Husband likes to eat these in the morning. They are high in protien and low in sugar and cabs. The tast is prety good as well.
2,Gross,There are SO many more products out there better than this. I think it tastes like crap and hard to chew/go down. I wouldn't recommend it at all and I'm a huge EAS fan.
1,EAS bars melted,I love the EAS Carb Sense Bars - Peanut Butter Choc flavor. I ordered through Amazon because I couldn't find them in my local store and the other store I used had melted version of the bars. I ordered from Amazon hoping they would have figured out how to circumvent the texas summer heat. I was wrong. The 3 boxes I order all came melted. I love the product but delivery seems to be a problem in the summer. I'm not ordering via Amazon until the weather turns in my favor.
1,Taste real bad,bleck! these are the worst tasting low carb bars out there - do not taste like peanut butter at all
3,Just OK,"These bars are low glycemic index controlled sugar, which is good, however they try and overcompensate to bring some sweetness with some products they have added and they are really weird tasting - too strongly trying to taste like sugar and they don't. I didn't like them and didn't finish them."
5,Great product,"It's a great protein bar! The taste is perfect and Myoplex is the best whey on the market, I really recommend this product!"
4,Tastes great,"i use a half of thebar pre workout, just to appease my hunger. Does the trick, and it contains good proteins."
2,Disgusting,"I bought these for my diet and they literally tasted so bad my stomach turned... I only had one and am going to give the rest away.. ICK... THere are other Myoplex lite bars I love, but these are HORRIBLE!"
2,Stale and Dry,"I originally ordered the Peanut Butter flavor, but had to substitute for the Fudge Brownie flavor when the supplier said they didn't have the Chocolate Peanut Butter bars. The product was dry and seemed old. It took a long time for the bars to be delivered also from the time I originally ordered them."
1,Do not buy!,"Do not buy this kit! It was awful. The glow-in-the-dark paint flaked off as soon as it was dry. Some of the planets are ridiculouly small (who cares if they're to scale!). The line was hard to tie, did not stay tied, remained coiled because the planets were so small and was unattractive (should have been more like fishing line). My daughter spent a great deal of time on this project and in her words ""It did not work."""
1,Not worth it,In the first 2 or 3 levels of the game are pretty fun. Challanging enough that its fun but still not to hard to pass. But on the 4 level it just got imposible. You have a ghost that chases you and takes your energy and you die about 20 sec. after the level begins. No instructions on how to get away or kill the ghost. So now noone even attempts to pass it. Waste of money!
2,originality doesnt make a CD good,"This CD only got bumped up from 1 start to 2 because the band is so original. It sounds terrible, but it give them points for doing somthing nobody else is doing...who knows, maybe this album will grow on me, but i severley doubt it"
1,Barley Pushing The Boundaries,"These guys lately have had many articles about how they are supposed to be pushing the boundaries of extreme music, but in the end to me it didn't seem like anything that hasn't been tried in the past five years or so. Especially the parts of mixing the hardcore and jazz elements, I've heard many bands do better. Perhaps if they learned their instruments a little better it would all come across better. Some parts even reminded me of really bad nu-metal bands, but these guys were still a step above those bands. Another reason I didn't get into it much was all the rapping, I'm mainly into hardcore and the extreme side of metal, and feel rap has no place in either style."
1,A Candiria fan frustrated,When Beyond Reasonable Doubt dropped in 97 I was in awe! Crazy metal/hardcore with breakdowns and jazz?!! And some actually decent hip hop wow! It was original and fresh. However it has been down hill since. A rehashed version of their former selves have become more apparent on their last two lps. Is it me or Carley's voice is getting more annoying as time goes on? While trying to be different they end up putting out the same shlock over and over again.
1,Disappointed,"I read so many good things about this album yet was let down by every song here, I'm usually a fan of hardcore and punk, and can be open to different things, but the styles these guys displayed didn't seem genuine. It also seems like they aren't good at just one style and hide it by playing many."
4,damn good,...300% density is a solid record and shows a good solid change in their sound. Old and new fans will definetly need to check this one out. You wont be dissapointed.
2,Nothing New,"The high level of musicianship cannot be denied...but I am left with the feeling that it is really contrived, and well just not genuine. The melding of different styles is nothing new and can be traced back as far as New England composer Charles Ives. More recently, John Zorn's Naked City was a much more effective and creative melding of different musical idioms. Ultimately the albums not bad, especially constant velocity.. but if you want to hear a more original and succesful mixing of the different genre's, check out Naked City's Naked City and Torture Garden."
4,Great CD for anyone's hardcore collection,"This CD is amazing. The drummer is nuts, so is the vocalist, and the mixing of many different musical styles is very cool. Beware though, at first, this album sounds chaotic and disorganized. However, after many listens you will find complex structuring that works very well overall. The guitar is reminiscent of Meshuggah's work. The only thing that could be better is more complex riffs and maybe better vocal placement, but those are the only gripes I have. This CD is great for anyone who's into metalcore or original music in general."
5,Unlike anything I've ever heard before,"I was watching television one day and came across an interview with a band called Candiria. I never heard of them and didn't watch the whole thing. A few weeks later i saw their CD in a store and bought it. I listened to it, and at first it seemed to just be a lot of noise, but after I REALLY listened, I was pulled in.Candiria are completely original, combining several genres of music into a genius sound. The singer has a lot of talent, as do the other members of the band. But the drummer is simply incredible.The CD itself is amazing. It has the elements of metal, hip hop, jazz and hardcore. This is pulled off beautifully by Candiria. The songs may not be catchy tunes, or aggressive yelling, but they are great to listen to regardless. I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for a new original sound."
3,Good L.I.D. but quality is off,"This is a good limited ingredient diet and most of the time my little Maltese likes it. I just purchased a second case from Amazon. The first had a few cans that were a soggy mess but most were of a normal consistency so I didn't think much of it. I'm on the 4th can of the second case and they all seem to have too much moisture and are a soggy mess. I have to refrigerate the can for a day before opening it so that I can portion out his food. My dog is less thrilled with the mess and I can't even warm it quite to room temperature before he'll refuse it. I don't know if the food was stored improperly at Amazon, if something happened in the shipping, or if Natural Balance doesn't have good quality control and ""bad"" cans seem go to Amazon but I haven't had the same problem with the cans that I buy at the Petco store."
2,Mushy and watery..all cans//,"Normally this is the only dog food our Boston Mandee will eat, however, when we open the cans the dog food is mushy with water on the top...very disappointed...not what we purchase from our pet store...more expensive but not MUSH at least..what's the problem!?"
5,2 Big Lab Mixed Dogs Love this stuff,"In the last couple of years, I have change brands a couple of times after extensive research. I ended up making homemade batches starting with my vet's recommendation and then modifying the ingredients based on further reading. The health of my dogs improved (11yr old and 7yr old). They were looking and feeling better, evident in their energy level, skin, and their coats. Personal schedules were going to be very busy for a couple of weeks and I knew I was not going to be able to keep up with the homemade batches. I switched to Natural Balance Duck/Potato for a temporary solution and the results have been terrific. Of course they love the stuff but they are more alert, bright eyed, and playful than ever. Although it is more expensive, it is great to know you can get excellent quality out of a commercial dog food product. I will be reordering for sure."
3,Too bad.,"My dog did not appreciate this food. I don't know why, although I suspect it is the potatoes. I misread the label as I was looking for rice. All three of my dogs have an aversion to potatoes, but after I bought it--well to late. I used it as back-up food. This may be my problem only but my advice to the company and the dog owner is scrap the potato."
4,Dogs did not care for it,I purchased Natural Balance duck and potato formula canned food. It is a great product with healthy ingredients but unfortunately my two Great Danes did not care for it. They get half a can along with their Fromm dry dog food twice a day and they took much longer to eat than with other high quality canned foods. Good product but my beasts are a bit too choosey.
2,Kate is beginning to lose it...,I was extremely excited to hear about ANYTHING new from Kate and couldn't wait to add this to my collection. The song Pi really threw me and I had to look at lyrics book to actually believe what I was hearing. It would have made more sense if it was titled PIE and she sang the recipe for an apple pie. As far as Mrs. Bartolozzi goes I can only wonder if she is saving her tomes on other household appliances for future release. If I didn't have a store credit and only paid $1.42 out of pocket for this work of 'art' I would have serious buyer's remorse.
1,I have tried and failed .......,"....to find anything worthy of Kate's past greatness on this release - God, I've tried but I've now given up.My level of disappointment is immeasurable. I have been a fan of Kate's work for 27 years and was so excited about this impending release.Everything has already been covered in the negative posts.I can only add that ""Aerial"" is the biggest load of old tosh I have purchased this year; and I buy around 5 CDs per week from many genres.I have EVERY previous Kate release - in the preceding weeks I reached for my copies of ""The Kick Inside"", ""Lion Heart"" & ""Never Forever"" (never far from my CD player).... and all crammed full of beauty, quirkiness, sobriety and madness .... just listen to the exchange between ""In Search Of Peter Pan"" & ""Wow"" .... it reduces me to tears.""Aerial"" reduces me to tears of a different kind; tears of abject horror that Kate's talent has gone down the domestic drain!She should now retire gracefully as she is no longer relevant."
2,I waited years for this horrible CD,"There are no really good songs on this cd. i am not writing an indepth review of each song because all are just self indulgences for Kate Bush. This is an ode to her ego. The only true great cd which I bought 3 copies were 'The Hounds of Love'. Nearly every song was great. And the video of 'cloudbursting' from the cd was wonderful with an apperance by Donald Sutherland as her father.Her next album , I beleive 'Ruberband Girl' had one good song written for an 80's movie 'She's having a Baby' called 'This Woman's work' as the only great song and a few were decent.But her new CD is frankly bad. But since I loved 'Hounds of Love' so much, I still have hope for Kate and gave her two stars. Just don't stay away fromm the studio so long. It's like everything else, practice and perfect your kraft or lose the talent."
2,A Die-Hard Wilts,"I was sorely disappointed as I listened to Kate's new release. I have always held out the highest of expectations for Kate and have been rewarded. Her growth as an artist and fascinating take on rhythm and imagery has been a joy to witness through out the years, but today, as I listen to my beloved Kate sing about her washing machine, and listen to the repetitive phrasing this cd, I'm reminded of performance art music, without the performance. Am I missing something here? I get the sense that Kate has produced this in a box, with no real breath to supplement her talent. Over time, I'm sure there may be one or two songs that I will assimilate into my personal world soundtrack, but for Kate, that's a real Tank."
1,"Come on, this album is a fake","As a long time fan f Kate Bush this album is completely boring, lack of ideas, very bad songwriting, and i ended up hating the kid. A warning for the Kate's fans, this album is a waste of money.Very very bad Kate, after 14 years you came to us with this? It's disgusting to read that most of the reviews give 5 stars to this collection of bad b-sides, you are no objetive anymore!I hope there will be a fans reaction against this album, we're completely disapointed with it, and it's our duty to say this for Kate to know."
4,2005 IS THE YEAR OF COMEBACKS!!,"Kate has been an inspiration for countless artists and after the failure of The Red Shoes I'm happy to see that Kate still has something in her. Aerial is in 2-disc format just to keep it old fashion (like records w/ the two sides and Hounds of Love had it too). I have been an avid fan of Kate ever since Hounds of Love & Sensual World, but this takes the cake. Aerial is one of the best new releases of 2005. Go Kate!!!!"
5,*****moving*****,It never ceases to amaze me how people expect their favourite artists to remain in the same place both musically and lyrically from album to album....static in other words.Yes Aerial is different from Kate's other albums but like us all she has progressed both as a person and in her writing to encompass how she now exists in this strange but wonderful world. What more can we expect from such a talented person?It is not my intention here to reveal favourite tracks from either of these two CD's as these too will change with familiarity. I urge any would be purchaser to pop on the headphones and listen with the heart as once again after many years Kate Bush weaves her magic.
2,Kate is lost in boring themes,"I was in love with Kate Bush' music, not in love with her. I want to make this point clear because I suspect the vast majority of people who declare that this is a great album are long-time fans that are in love with her and cannot listen to the record without thinking ""oh my God, in her first album in twelve years, it MUST BE good. I am sorry to tell you, but, the album is not good at all. It is boring and old-fashioned. And, when you listen to the songs, they remind you of other (and better) songs by Kate. The music of Kate I loved fishishes in ""The Sensual World"", her last album I can consider impressive. ""The red shoes"" showed signs of lost of creativity, and, in ""Aerial"" these signs are very clear. If you search for female singers and composers that take risks now, think about Bjork, Anja Garbarek or my last discovery, Hanne Hukkelberg, this is the music Kate shoud be offering now, not a remake of her previous days of glory. A real pity."
3,Missing the Old Kate,"Am I the only one that misses the old Kate Bush, the one that wrote some of the most interesting and compelling pop melodies you've ever heard mixed with dense, lush, complicated arrangements? I get it that she's grown (or outgrown) the conventional pop structure and mainstream arrangements and I respect that...BUT can't she throw us some of the beautiful and haunting melodies that are her true gift. I keep buying her discs, which granted are few, waiting years to hear another ""This woman's work"", ""under the Ivy"", ""Cloudbursting"", ""Night of the Swallow"" or anything from her first three albums. This disc is a collection of some pleasant songs, as usual, very interesting lyrics, and facinating arrangements, but without the melodies I know I won't be listening to this in six months. Kate, we get it, you're too good for mere pop music, but why waste your talent for beautiful melody? So few artists really have it."
2,Left Me Completely Disappointed...,"You won't find any of Kate Bush's trademark over-the-top vocals on this one. Kate has definitely taken a more mellowed out approach with softer vocals. I expected (and wanted) her to let loose on at least some of the tracks, but she keeps it calm the entire way. Too bad, I expected more after a 12 year(?) hiatus."
3,Trying hard,"To put it quickly: I love Kate Bush's artistry, however out of the two discs, I find myself only listening to one. I'd have to say it feels like she had difficulty marrying her new life with her old passion and it took her two discs of material before she felt covered. Overall it reminds me of how I feel when I'm painting a canvas using techniques and concepts that served me well before but just aren't getting me to 'new space' this time around. That said, there is a remarkable track where she laughs in conversation with a bird song."
2,Disappointed.,"I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to ""Hounds of Love,"" but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this."
5,"Pure, gentle, beautiful","Never has Kate Bush's voice been so clear, pure, and gently expressive. Her voice and piano are primary. . .other instrumentation provides color on the fringes, creating a feeling of space and breeze. She creates images one breath at a time. Truly sensational."
5,Bush in Fur Out,"The best songs on the new cd are: Pi, Mrs. Bartolozzi, How to be Invincible, Nocture, Aerial, Somewhere in Between, Prelude, and An Architects Dream.The cd set is well worth the wait.As for all of the wackos giving the cd bad reviews..go ahead and put in your Tori Amos and Hadgonna cd's. We know you you people are."
1,I waited 12 years for this?,"Sorry to buck the trend here, but this is not just bad, its bad Kate Bush, which makes it all the more tragic. I know fans have been starved for new music from Kate for over a decade, but this is not even remotely indicative of why I fell in love with her music back in 1978. Overly selfindulgent to the point of parody, this album cries out for a good producer. Maybe 6 tracks should have been kept, and the rest discarded. I hope she gets back on her feet for the next release - but when will that be?"
2,Bland,"I've owned this album for 4 years now. I keep meaning to get it off the shelf for another listen, but rarely do. Tonight I had another go and once again remember why this CD gathers so much dust. I suppose its nice enough, in a bland sort of way. A few nice songs on A Sky of Honey. Not much to say about Sea of Honey except 'yawn'. Kate's a fine musician and it still shows. Pity the songs are so boring."
3,Far from a slam dunk,"I admire Kate's talent, but had hoped for something a little more focused and melodic. I don't hear, for the most part, the songs - these tracks just don't work, with a few exceptions, as songs.The qualities in these lyrics some reviewers are calling personal just strike me as too willfully obscure, too airy- fairy.And, to indulge in plain-speaking, some of the cuts here are just, well, good old-fashioned boring.While I fully appreciate where Ms. Bush is coming from and what she stands for, I don't think she hit this one out of the park (it's sports metaphor day at the Bickle household). As they say so often (and truthfully) about double albums, there's probably a very decent and respectable single album in here someplace."
5,I love this CD,"I'm not going to get all pretentious and pretend to be a music reviewer, but all I have to say is those who gave this disk a bad review simply did not listen to it. The thing that I love about this disk is that Kate grew and did do the same thing. She's proven herself to be an arist for the new millenium. And as Kate say in Ariel...""I've gotta be up on the roof, up, up high on the roof...............You better go Kate!"
3,mothering heights,"i have ""kick inside"" and ""the red shoes"" right and the ""kick inside"" is a great debut album ""red shoes is an average album but this my fellow friends is no ""kick inside"" this is a mish mash of a album with nice polite piano and other stuff and the washing machine is included plus you may get the kitchen sink..what about the lyrics 12 years for them get away..i was hoping of some great subjects for kate bush to be talking about not washing machines and what not.."
2,Pretty Album Cover But...,"I have to say I'm very suprised that Kate is back in business. And I'm very happy for her. But this album is a disappointment. I have heard it and only two songs really stand out, King of the Mountain and Pi. Otherwise, it's just a really pretty album cover but a really bad album. I hope Kate is here to stay, but please do better than this."
1,"a grave, grave, and utter disappointment","Hello, there was a time when KB was really hot, an alternatively talented singer from Never for ever, Babooshka, Lionheart, Running up that hill, The kicking side, wow, all dreamy and kinky beautiful records cds and tapes that were unique and speacial but after this longed timed silence this horrible cd is just a grave, grave and utter disappointment.I even feel the sickening spirit of voodoo is distorting the woman's skull.very sad.0 stars"
2,Critics darling,"Kate Bush is a very smart woman.She always was.She knows exactly the amount of time and EFFORT she needs to put in all of her records.And this album sounds great,but she is just trying once again to hide her dirty little secret.Very,very poor songwriting."
5,An album for people who love music....,"This is the root of why a lot of popular female artists are so successful... This album is amazing, but not for casual listening... To respect this CD, you'll have to hear the subtle unusual voices; the background chanting, children voices, the laughing, strange humming, birdsong, Italian, and group laughing... It's not a CD for short attention spans, the songs take time to build, but if you are patient, it is some of the most beautiful and innovative music out there...."
5,Rapture has a new name,"If you are a true Kate Bush fan, and have been following her career from the days of Wuthering Heights, then this new installment will be a revelation to you. Not only has Ms. Bush maintained her status as a truly unique artist, but has also set herself to be a a master of trance music. The second disc in this two disc set is truly a work of genius. She has masterfully woven a tale of light, water and life into a marvel that any trance fan would hail.After my first take listening to this, I wiped my tears away and focused on the beautiful craftsmanship that she poured into this opus.Our Kate is truly an artist beyond anyone currently on the market. She will see fabulous sales in Europe, but unfortunatly the American audience will overlook her once again.Kate, some of us appreciate the work you have done!!!!"
5,Extraordinary...,"Not much more that I can add to what's already been said. I would like to defend Kate a bit though against some of the more extreme negative reactions.I think if you're not into Ae, fine, but if your reaction to it is so profoundly negative and angry that you feel the need to write uninformed comments with no backing, it really does paint you as some kind of emotionally stunted wreck of a person.Of course, you can hate it if you like, but when you say things like ""It's horrible because she can't write a song"" or ""She doesn't know what she's doing,"" etc. you're really saying more about yourself and your own limitations. Or, to put it another way, just because you have the advantage of the Internet where you can write so-called ""reviews"" doesn't mean you should."
5,a pop masterpiece,"Occasionally an artist will take some time off. They go and live some life, then return to their craft with fresh perspective. They are true artists who buck the system. Instead of riding the crest of a commercial wave in capitalizing on sales, they choose to assiduously mine riches for our listening pleasure. Artists who come to mind are: Edie Brickell; Bryan Ferry; Peter Murphy and Richard Butler (who will be releasing his amazing new work in March 2006).Kate Bush has really delivered a gorgeous one (actually two discs) in Aerial. This is quite simply a masterpiece of sound that is filled with infinite nuances, masterful songwriting and beautiful arrangements. The packaging is brilliant. This is one to be treasured always...a classic."
5,Amazing,"I'm not going to give a blow-by-blow account of the cd - it's been done by many others. I will just share a little bit of my experience. I was very nervous that the album wouldn't live up to Kate's previous works, all of which I love for different reasons. (Yes, even the 'Red Shoes', though my favorites are 'Hounds of Love' and 'The Dreaming'.) When I first heard ""King of the Mountain"" on the web, I was slightly disappointed. It was very subtle at first - it didn't immediately blow me away. It grew on me, though, a little more each time I heard it. I was so excited when I purchased 'Aerial', I couldn't wait to get home to open it, so I played it on the computer at work on crappy little speakers, and I was still instantly smitten! It is amazing - she has not lost her touch at all! The woman can make singing Pi beautiful, and I'm so not a math person. :)So, if you don't have it already, what are you waiting for??"
5,"gorgeous, brilliant, uplifting, powerful, inspired!","I could keep going and going, singing Kate's praises, because this album is beyond fantastic! Very few artists out there can bring tears of joy to my eyes, but Kate does it time and again. The first disc is a great collection of songs with a wide range of styles and moods; the second disc is Kate's new masterwork, with many of the songs being among Kate's all-time best. The closing sequence is so damn good that I honestly want to cry out the cliché ""I'm not worthy!"". Just... wow."
5,Exceptional,"Kate Bush is a musical genius, as any of her fans know. The long time between albums was not worth the wait, but this album is worth its weight in gold. I've been a big fan since her debut album, and missed her the last 12 years, but I believe this is Kate's finest work ever. It's a full 80 minutes long, and I love every minute of it. How many 40 minute albums can you even say that about? The intoxicating melodies, intertwined sounds and vocal magic create a masterpiece. It's the best album of any genre released in 2005. It's not likely to receive commercial airplay, but Kate Bush never had that in mind when creating her beautiful music. This is an album you'll want to play over and over, and tell other people about, which is exactly what's happened with me."
1,Awful,"I have loved Kate Bush for over 20 years but this release is just awful. I don't remember one single song, nor do I want to. Just boring mishmashmush. If it was at least interesting I could understand, but this is just a craptacular meandering dull mess. I just hope Kate has one more album in her because it would be a tragedy to end her musical career with this loser."
3,Ambient Kate...,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Kate Bush's log awaited new album had been releases. And with a string of glowing reviews from both fans and reviewers how could you go wrong?Er, well... I don't quite see it myself. Now I've been a fan for too many years (yes, I remember Wuthering Heights hitting number 1 in the UK). Gone are the thundering tribal rhythms, and where is the emotion. With the exception of the penultimate track on disk 2, Nocturne, none of the songs really build to any climax but just fade away without real closure.Overall I'm happy I bought the album, a few more listens and I expect I'll appreciate it more. But sorry, I don't see the 5 stars anywhere in this album (unless most of her other ones are 10 stars).Oh, and you may want to play disk 2 first- it's a more cohesive bunch of songs than the first disk."
5,Hound of Love part two,"This is an emotional album. If it does not get to you within three plays it never will. You just want to play it over and over and get lost in the dense fabric of nostalgia and joy for life. It is a work that comes with age, and all the reviews I have read seem to totally miss the point. An album to listen to with the lights out, to drift along like in a dream. Kate is a genius. At some point an artist creates the ultimate example of their art. This is 21st century Kate Bush."
1,The Queen (of the Drags?) is back,"and headaches,headaches and headaches.But at least she is not screaming so much anymore.Kate Bush always wrote these horrible songs that only her Pseudo-intellectual fan-boys can take.She was always the Cher for Pseudo-intellectuals.But she never wore the thong (thank God).She is not so loud and stupid anymore,but like it was said before,her poor songwriting it's evident.Washing Machine, really? Her fans-boys will say ""It's not about a washing machine"". Right...do yourself a favor and go read a good book."
1,Bought all her ablums and I say save your money,"Kate Bush was recommended to me so I went out and bought all her albums. Her voice is better than average, but other than that I heard no musical talent in the backround. It was just music with an empty feel for me. I took all the albums and pawned them off for other music. Save your money for a different artist. If you love music that has feeling, and makes you think deep you can't go wrong with the artist ""Eyna"". If you like to drive to music with a beat I've liked most of what I've heard from ""ATB"" and ""Enigma""."
5,A Musical Journey That Was Worth The Wait,"I am so fortunate to be able to still be alive to hear another Kate Bush Masterpiece. I thank the grace of God that my ears were able to take another musical journey to a world that Kate Bush takes me when she releases her albums. It's like awakening from a sweet dream, like giggling with over-joyness. I know this review is over-the-top hokey, but that's what I feel right now after listening to this album. In a word - WOW! ""It's gonna be so good now..."" K.B."
2,Oh Kate...how could you?,"I have been a Kate Bush fan since day one, and I NEVER thought I would be disappointed in a release by her, until now. It seems to be a mishmash of techno mumbo jumbo. I was just waiting for some diversity in this recording and it never seemed to change. The ambient beats OVER and OVER with very little change from track to track seemed more like an ode to ENYA than a true Kate release. Perhaps she should have taken another couple of years and rethought this. I hope motherhood has not destroyed her creativity."
4,Overall a good book for halloween,"This is a pretty good book of halloween-themed stories. Overall, it's a good book with effective stories, but the stories themselves differ very much in themes. Some are humoristic, some are like fairy tales and others are more ""classical"" horror stories, including one of Lovecraft's hand. If you want an anthology of stories that have similar styles and atmospheres, don't try it, you will be disappointed, but if your objective is to remind yourselves about all of Halloween multi-facetted meanings, then indulge yourself with this wonderful book. Just don't expect the story you're starting to read to be like the one you've just finished. You will have your favorites, and you will have your not-so-favorites, but all the stories achieve what their authors sought to do with them.As for me, I believe it's going to become an annual tradition for October."
2,Not for my puppy!,"For some reason, my puppy did not like these training pads. My boyfriend had to tape them down so she wouldn't carry them away! She eventually just scratched them up off the floor and tore it to shreds. I think they would work if your puppy is already pad trained."
1,Soaks through,"We purchased these training pads for our 6 pound dachshund puppy who we are having a terrible time housebreaking. The first time he peed on them, they soaked right through to the rug. So we tried doubling them and overlapping them, and they still soaked through. We've had to throw out several rugs in the two months we've had the puppy and we got these to protect our remaining rugs but they do not work. Our rug stinks of urine in the spots we have the pads. And we have to throw out the pads almost as soon as he goes on them because they do not absorb any urine smell. We would've been better off using nothing ad just letting our puppy pee on the rugs since we still have to clean under where the pads are.We're going back to the training pads we got at PetSmart, since they actually absorb the urine and there is virtually no leak-thru."
2,Not that pleased,"I purchased these pads for my pomeranian. He still has ""accidents"". I like Natures Miracle products and will try another pad that they sell. I hope it works better. These pads are thin and not very absorbant."
2,Not the best choice,I purchased this item for my yorkie and noticed that the urine goes thru the pamper. I have to use two pampers in order to avoid the urine going thru. I have a trick that if you put 1 pamper(white side) facing down(on the floor)then one on top(regular position); it's a guaranteed that nothing will go thru.
2,Together with the worst...,"I have tried probably half of the other brands. These are the thinnest and the price is up there.Better and cheaper are the ones you find in 99 cent stores and the Gridlock brand which are bigger, thicker and cheaper per pad.Enough said."
3,It was great until redesigned....,"I love""D"" this product. One of my cats refuse to use the litterbox and prefers training pads. I was buying this Nature's Miracle cases at a time. It ""WAS"" very thick. Every now and then, because I bought so much, I would have a pack with defected pads. Then one day in 2011 (?), I bought another 8 bags (2 cases). I was so disappointed with the change in the quality. The pads were so much thinner that they have a sheer look. It is so obviously that they were not as thick which affected the absorbancy. I no longer use Nature's Miracle."
4,Good compilation of Bowie songs,"This is the best of the Bowie compilations out there. It takes great bands covering a good selection of Bowie songs, unlike other compilations who only include ""Let's Dance"" and ""Cat People"". I'm impressed that ""Andy Warhol"", one of the best Bowie songs, was included, and Tree People do a good version. The Magnetic Fields also do an admirable version of ""Heroes"". All in all, the best Bowie covers are spread around in artist's solo albums, but if you're looking for a good collection of Bowie covers, this is the one to get.."
3,Crash Course Crashes,"At first appearance, this seems to be just another in a long, long time of David Bowie tribute albums. And, honestly, that's just what it is. However this time around, we have a collection of northwest indie bands paying tribute to the dame. As of this writing, i've had the album for a couple years now, and while there's nothing wrong with it, i haven't listened to it in ages. There just doesn't seem to be anything exceptional here that you can't find on one of the other dozen Bowie tribute albums.Recommended only for the hardcore Bowiefan who takes an interest in the interpretations of others on his stuff."
4,Kitty loves it,"My cat loves these herring steaks. They are one of his favorite treats, and some of the only treats he can eat. He has digestive problems and can't eat grains. These treats are nothing but dried fish, and so are perfect for him."
3,This edition is flawed.,"This edition suffers from two flaws. There is no table of contents, which means there is no way to easily navigate through the book. Also the included scripture references are frequently mistyped, meaning they bare no relationship to the text you are reading. It should be noted that this edition only contains part one."
1,Tab.of .Cont. N.G. Search also No Good. A junky version even for 89 cents.,T.O.C. N.G. Search also No Good. A junky version even for 89 cents. And I can't seem to return it. We need accurate statements about the quality of the Kindle versions so we can choose appropriately. I do better formatting the books and uploading them myself.
2,an opinion comieng from a true tejano collector.,"I have this album ,its ok . I understand its out of print ,but I wouldn't pay anything over 15 bucks for this album,just cause its out of print it dosent mean its a great cd,i collect tejano music by the tons,and I tell you this album is just alright. The best songs on this album are""pacto de amor"" and "" un amor a la vez"" he actually pulled out a new album about two years ago ,now that one is pretty good, the only thing that sucks the cd only has 8 songs. But over all yea its ok,not one of ur best in tejano artists."
3,not as comfy as i remember,"i've been wearing the saucony jazz shoes for the last 8 years and they've held up great. just got new black ones and i haven't gotten a new pair in like 5-6 years and i remember feeling like they were little mattresses on my feet and these don't feel that way. they are harder and after walking around all day in them, my heels ache a bit :("
4,cloud walking,I really like the Shadow and jazz sneakers. thank your including the dark navy laces-the white were a bit stark in contrast to the shoe. Wish the white on the sole was navy too. Do you still make the all leather kind of shadow /jazz sneaker?
2,Comfort Girl,"Although this shoe is really lacking in the comfort area, I gave it 2 stars for price as I purchased it for just under $25. I'll be sure to wear them when much walking isn't required."
4,AWESOME SHOES,"These shoes are sweet! Ever since I got them, I have worn them just about every day. They are comfy and look sweet. I've gotten a lot of compliments from people who like my new shoes! I would definitely buy this brand again-- heck, maby i'll get them in a different color...that's how much I like them!"
5,Great sneakers,"I wear these sneakers out til there's not much left of them, then replace them. I wear them to work out- they're very comfortable. They are a mainstay in my closet."
1,not up to par with the other Reacher books,"I have read 5 or 6 of the Reacher series and have enjoyed them all and always looked forward to the ""next page"". For the most part they have kept my interest right up to the last page.This story did not hold my interest after the first couple of chapters."
2,Conversational yet empty,"There's not much of a mystery here, but it is strong on descriptions of violence and the iron-jawed determination of its characters. It also has the subtlety of a soap opera, and it likes to beat us the readers over the head with victimhood, suffering, sadness and futility. Child writes exceptionally well in a simple, conversational style, but his book needs an edit and before he writes another, he should give these characters and situations more depth. Much as the plot in pornography is an excuse to get the clothes off, the plot in ""Persuader"" is a flimsy justification for violence."
2,Good + Too Violent,"I really liked Child's take on the ""just the facts ma'am"" tough guy prose. But -- just too violent, for me; too brutal, too much horrifying torture. I won't read another, and if I could take it back, I would unread this. Some things aren't meant to be put into the mind...."
3,persuader by lee childs,The book came in the mail in the condition dicribed. They mailing time was unexceptable. over i month. The cost of the book was deducted from my account in a week. If I hadn't been so ill I would have had to start the process of lost book. I could have driven to Pa from NJ to get the book. I'm not use to this deplorable type of service from Amazon suppliers.Lynn in New Jersey
4,A Winner Again,"Lee Child never disapoints. Jack Reacher again comes through with all the grit and strength he has shown in all his other novels. I have come to find even though he has a Rambo style about him, he works with a good investigative mind. I sincerly recommend this book. I have now read all of them and there is not one I wouldn't highly applaud."
3,Slow moving,I have enjoyed all of the JR books but this one was slow moving all the way to the end and more than a bit unbelievable that Quinn survived two direct shots to the head as well as a fall off the cliff 10 years before this saga occurred. Still looking forward to #8 though... Tom Cruise. ... give me a break...
4,Addicted!,"Each time I finish one of these books, I swear I'm going to take a break and read something different, only to go back and get the next one in the series. Persuader was one of the best so far, reinforcing my addiction! Hey, winter is for reading, right?"
5,ricks reviewThisbook,"This book is suspenseful and left me tired because I did not want to put it down. When I did put the book down, I was anxious to pick it up and read some more. I actually neglected some chores in order to get back to reading sooner. I think it is great reading."
3,persuader,"I found the story a little fragmented. Not Childs' best work. Quite a few areas where the background of situations not mentioned but would have given more understanding when reading the story. As we know with his following titles, Childs becomes more proficient at his art.Still worth a read."
4,Jack Fan,"I am a huge fan of Lee child and Jack Reacher. I have yet to be disappointed by his books, I find the character interesting, afraid of no one and a real man's man - someone that will solve all the problems and then disappear. The book is full of action and it keeps you hooked until the very last page. If you are looking for a HERO then Lee Child and Jack Reacher are your solution."
2,Bad Jack Reacher,I believe this is the lamest Jack Reacher novel I have ever read - and I have read quite a few. Usually they keep you on the edge of your seat and this one about put me to sleep.
5,"LOVED IT SO MUCH, I READ IT THREE TIMES","PERSUADER is the 7th book in the Jack Reacher series. I've have all the books with Reacher and have read them multiple times. However, Persuader is one of my favorite. I won't say how many Reacher kills in this book, but I think it's the most of all the books.Jack is in Boston, walking down a street when he bumps into a man from his past that Reacher had actually killed ten years ago. The man steps into a Limo and drives off. Reacher calls in favors and ends up infiltrating a drug dealer's business to help out the Feds.This book is packed with gripping suspense, fast-paced action, fighting and shooting. I highly recommend this excellent story."
5,Persuader,"I think Lee Child is a Master with his Jack Reacher novels. I am 72 years old and am a lifetime 'mystery' reader, I have 11 of the Reacher Novels and they are the best for mystery adventure and action. I'm more than a little dissappointed that there aren't lots more of them."
4,The best hero,Jack Reachrr is the best thriller hero around. Lee Child does not disapoint with Reacher. Reacher gives it his all every time. I love reading or listening to audiobooks in this series because there is never a dull moment. Something totally unexopected always happens. I hope Lee Child keeps on doing the great job he is doing and keeps on writing about the best hero-Jack Reacher.
3,could have told better story with less pages,"yes, the details are exhaustive at times. I really wanted to get to the end long before it was there. It's my first Reacher book, so I'd like to reserve author judgment until I read another. It was a page turner thru the middle."
4,Don't give up too soon,At first I thought the writing style was a bit clumbsy. But after the first few pages i forgot i was reading a book and just enjoyed the ride.
5,Jack Reacher,"WOW! This was my first Lee Child/Jack Reacher book and it certainly will NOT be my last! I couldn't put it down. I loved Jack Reacher from page one and that love only grew the longer I read. He's an incredible character! I've already pre-ordered the Kindle book coming out in May and cannot wait to read it! Lee Child has a brand new fan. Where has he been all my life?? I can't believe what I've been missing! Never again. Any book he writes from here on out, is mine."
3,VERY clever opening -- ultimately disappointing,"I've read all of the Reacher Series. ""Die Trying"" was my first, and Reacher and the plot intrigued me. I went back and read the earlier one, ""Killing Floor,"" and enjoyed it, too. In fact the first four were well above average for the genre. Reacher is an implausible, comic-book-hero type character. He gets into lots of interesting scrapes and intriguing situations -- always involving a beautiful young lady several years his junior with a very active libido. The books are action-packed but sometimes smothered in detail. The later books (especially ""Echo Burning,"" his weakest) seem even slower and less engaging. My advice is to start at the beginning and read until you no longer want to know what happens next. Yes, I'm through with Reacher. John Sandford, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Nelson DeMille, James Lee Burke, Janet Evanovich, Robert Parker's Sunny Randall, and Jeffrey Deaver are keeping me entertained."
4,"We know he's a killer, but he's OUR killer.","Jack Reacher is the prototype guy whose military career taught him that it's okay to kill people and hasn't been able to get over it. In real life, we try to throw such psychos in jail. Reacher's saving grace is that he kills only bad guys. Lee Child writes engrossing novels about Reacher, but they're a guilty pleasure because of their premise that it's okay to use a homicidal vigilante to straighten out your problems or misjudgments. This idea is not unique to Lee Child's books, but Reacher seems singularly unaffected by slaughter. In the hands of a less skilled writer, Reacher's amorality would just be a joke. In the current book, Reacher demonstrates his versatility by dispatching a houseful of thugs, using firearms, rocks, neck holds, and chisels. Despite the fatalities, I'm sure that I'll pick up the next Reacher novel, however."
4,persuader,"A little bit far fetched even for Jack Reacher. Not the best book that I have read but certainly not the worst. Fortunately I followed this book up with ""One Shot"" which once again raised the standard. As a new user of Kindle I find the concept very very good. I no longer have to carry heavy, thick books with me on the road."
4,Lee Child's books make for fun summer reading!,"I have become addicted to reading about the exploits of Jack Reacher in Lee Child's books. Sometimes it is pretty hard to lay the book down and get to sleep. Good writer, fun books"
5,My First,One of the best books that I have ever read. It only took this one book for me to be hooked with Jack Reacher He is an all American Bad ass. Great book.
4,Heck of A First Chapter,"If the reader is willing to suspend his disbelief quite a ways, PERSUADER will satisfy the action junkie's taste for thrills. The opening sequence is absolutely nails. It, alone, is worth the price of admission.What follows doesn't completely fulfill that promise. It's a complicated, sordid business with a massive body count. There are times when it feels like Child himself is lost in his own plot, painting himself into difficult corners.The location of most of the novel--a promontory on the Maine coast--offers no escape for the novel's characters but it seems a hindrance to the author, too. By the we reach the third act, the reader will be aching for a new setting. It doesn't come.Still, Reacher continues to fascinate. His single-minded pursuit of western-style justice makes PERSUADER very readable. There are a lot worse ways to spend a couple of days."
5,Rocking and Rolling Action Packed,"I chanced upon this terrific novel at the bookstore where I work. On a whim I picked it up and started reading--what a ride. It's probably the most pleasantly surprised I've been in a long while. The action is hot and super-fast paced. Reacher is a terrific hero who is the modern day equivalent of Dirty Harry. I could almost envision a young Clint Eastwood in the part. I've heard rumors that all of the Child novels have been optioned, so I'll eagerly await the next novel this summer and the movies hopefully to come."
4,Plenty of Suspense and Action,"I believe that Persuader is the seventh and latest in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Again, in this book as with all the other Reacher novels Mr. Child created a plot with numerous twists and turns. I found that in this story the author placed more emphasis on Reacher's combat skills. The story begins with a kidnapping and shootout, then as the story moves along Reacher finds himself infiltrating a smuggler's household where he could be killed if discovered. In summary this is a wonderful, suspense fill novel that I highly recommend."
5,Fantastic!,"The Persuader was my first Lee child novel, and since then i've been hooked. Lee Child has an incredible way of capturing the reader's attention and making every word count. I would recommend any Lee Child novel to anybody who's willing to give it a try, because i know you will not be disappointed."
4,solid,"There is not much of intrigue here but there is plenty of action, which surprisingly does not look stupid. It is a solid, entertaining read."
2,Stretches patience to the limit,"As much as I love Jack Reacher, Lee Child does him a disservice in Persuader. Child's ability to set up obstacles for Reacher is creative, but he is over his head when it comes to sustaining the thrill. No matter how compelling a scene, Child is uncanny in the way he can stretch it past a logical end, leaving the reader unsatisfied and, in some cases, bored. Had I not felt committed at page 409, I would have thrown the book across the room in frustration. While reading Persuader, I wondered who had the toughest time finishing this story - Jack Reacher or me."
1,3rd of three 1 stars from me,I've read 3 of his books - this is the worst of the 3 - not worth any more letters let alone words.One point - he's still doing the 3 plots woven together - see my other comments - it's still easy to jump over the filler. I'll not read another - even if free.
5,Persuader,"Since I've discovered Lee Child, I'm in the process of gathering up all he's written and enjoying all of them. He's rather unrealistic with his character but who cares? I read for the escapism from reality.."
4,Searching Far,"Child's creation of Jack Reacher was a breath of fresh air: a man who is not financially driven. The earlier books were intriguing and the reader wants Reacher to come out on top while remaining himself. The later books are as enjoyable to read, but Child is beginning to reach too far in giving Reacher almost supernatural strengths and ingenuity. I greatly prefer the honesty of Reacher remaining human."
3,Okay,"Lee Child - Persuader This was not the quality of writing that I have come to expect with Lee Child, felt like someone else wrote it. Good plot and story but not up to high standard of writing style I have come to expect. Will try the next book and see how it is. Corey"
4,The Jack Reacher series by Lee Child,"I highly recommend any of the books in this series! The plots are very well worked out and Jack is a very well rounded charecter (sorry, can't spell the word). They don't have to be read in the order written but it makes it more enjoyable."
5,Persuader,"I'm in love with Jack Reacher! Have been since I read ""One Shot"". Like all of the Reache rnovels, I has a hard tinme putting this novel down. A great read and lots of action."
3,Good Read,"Not his best, but a good read. I've enjoyed all of Child's books. I'm Looking forward to the next one..."
5,Persuader Best of the Best,"I love Jack Reacher and his violent novels. I have just finished my last Reacher book;, ""The Enemy"". It was terrific but Persauder was the best and the first I read,Now, in the space of 2 months I have hunted them down at Amazon.com and now I have the next on order for springtime.I have a new favorite smart, tough guy whose realism in fighting, killing, detecting and reasoning is spellbinding.I can feel the sting of the bullets, boot kicks and the throughness of an elbow in disabling an opponent or the head butt.As an ex Army man I can appreciate (many years but you never forget) the accuracy with which he persues his logic and power.It's exciting to watch a 6 foot 5 inch 220 ruthless good guy and I am a permanent convert. My wife is on her second one now.Thank you Lee Child for giving a lover of thrillers and cops/ robbers, assassians, lawyers, the underbelly of our world, a new hero."
3,Robert Ludlum in waiting?,"I loved ""Killing Floor"" and have recommended it to circa 100 people by now. But each subsequent Jack Reacher novel has been a disappointment. It almost seems like Lee Child ran out of gas.""Persuader"" is not bad but it lacks credibility. Lee Child seems to have set an ambitious pace. He produces one book every year or so. Lee, please slow down. Don't become another Ludlum !!!"
5,Persuader # 7,"Jack Reacher doesn't do things by the book but he does what's right and solves mysteries as only a high caliber investigator can. All of these books should be made into mini TV movies with one a week. And by the way, The folks who put Lee Child's Jack Reacher to film should have read one of the books before casting his part - there are any number of actors who would have looked the part better than Tom Cruise!"
3,improbable,More improbable than most of the Reacher series. More like a superman story with acts and deeds that are a real stretch
5,Jack Reacher,I love this series. Started with No. 1 and have just started No. 8. Thank you Lee Child for creating this series
4,Fast as a train,Moves very quickly. A diagram of the house and grounds would have helped. Very good 're a d none the less.
4,okay,"I like Jack Reacher and the book was good, but the ending left lots to be desired. Don't know if I'll read the next one."
3,Decent entertainment,"This was my first Jack Reacher book and it was so-so. I was entertained enough to keep reading and there were parts where I was hooked, but at times confused and bored.I knew nothing about the character so I was confused by who he was and what he was doing for much of the book. Perhaps having read others first would have helped. Also without much back-story of the main character, I found him rather boring and empty, particularly in the beginning, but as the story progressed, I found him more interesting.The ending was a bit bland and I finished wanting something a bit more spectacular for how long it took to get there.."
4,Another great one in the series,"I have read three other Reacher books.This is not the best one, but definitely comes very close.Child's writing style is fluid and very descriptive. He makes the scene come alive. Although sometimes the story gets bogged down in too many details about Reacher's movements. This story also moved slow in parts. It probably could have lost about 50 pages, and been an even better book."
3,Good but doesn't stand out,"Pretty classical Child: lots of action, suspense, with superhero Reacher. Story is ok but nothing exceptional."
5,Maybe the Best Jack Reacher Book!!!,"I have read four Reacher books till now.. but I guess this is the best of them.. Lot of suspense, action and each character is defined beautifully.. I loved the feud between Paulie and Jack.. Excellent book and great entertainment.."
5,"Exciting, mind blowing",Very well written. Lots of believable action! Held my interest from the first page. Lee Child is an excellent author and I will be looking for more of his books.Richard Ruppel
4,There were flaws,"It was still a good book, but there were some flaws in the flow of this book as compared to the other Lee Child novels I have read. The beginning was great, but as the book moved along, there were characters who were just cartoon bad guys and sometimes the storyline was a bit jagged. I plan to move along and read No. 8 soon, so it the flaws were not enough for me to retreat from all Jack Reacher novels in the series. It just could have been better."
4,My First Reacher Novel,"Very action-packed from beginning to end. Reacher is on a mission to seek vengeance for the death of a former female subordinate in the Army. As usual, he has many hoops to jump through and is working with the FBI to hunt him down. The FBI has an altogether different motive to locate this individual because he might be responsible for a missing undercover agent whose cover was probably blown.Really good story. There are surprises in this one until the very end."
4,"Great start, so-so ending",I was completely entranced for the first 3/4 of the book...it was fresh and different and suspenseful. But then the ending felt like a typical hollywood action movie ending.
3,Thrilling novel at parts,"This was my first Lee Child books I read with Reacher. At first I was engrossed in the story. Child has a good clipped, clipped action packed style that keeps the story going. Though, by the middle of the novel things definately slowed down and I had to push myself to get through it since I wanted to read the whole book. The end definately picked up again, going back to that gritty action. The ending was a bit abrupt and predictable. Overall a good rainy day read."
4,Good all around book,"This is my first time reading a Lee Childs, Jack Reacher novel but I was impressed. I found the book entertaining and difficult to put down. Mr. Childs writes as I would. Although I am not a martial arts or weapons expert, I had no problem visualizing the moves and weapons. I have also lived in Boston so I had no problem visualizing the New England countryside as well.What I did find was the mention of how to bypass the kitchen metal detector a bit disturbing since now I am almost tempted to try it out to see if this is true. If I am curious and I am not a bad guy, , , ,I felt sad that the side plot to find Ms. Teresa Justice aka, Teresa Daniel's only received about a page worth of information. I also have the impression that the son Richard and the mother Elizabeth will have a future role in Mr. Childs book since their final fate was never really explained.Otherwise a good book. I am going to put Mr. Child's name on my list of authors to read."
3,Persuader,"I'm truly sorry, but Child spent way too much timeon irrelevant details--apparently proving to himself that he was a master of research and facts--even if the book could have done without them. It disappointed me, which is the only Reacher novel that has. All the rest are fantastic."
4,Love me some Jack Reacher,Another good story and the Reacher stories always leave me wanting more. Fast paced with the normal twist. He is a believable hero
3,Get bored during some parts of the book,"I really like Lee Child's books, but this one specifically disappointed me. I got bored during some parts of the book, and when I get bored I have to struggle to continue reading. I don't really recommend this book, the history behind it is not that good... But it's a Reacher's book and by that deserves at least 3 stars!"
5,"Dated, but fun","I bought this DVD because of the amount of exercise per dollar I get with Christi Taylor's DVD's. For the money, this, and her other compilation DVD's are the best out there.The 3 step routines range from 30-60 minute sessions. The cueing is good and they all have a complete warm-up and cool-down.You can tell that this was made in the 80's. Some of the ""dances"", running man, cabbage patch, etc., are dated, but they make it fun for me, since these dances were out in my day.I recommend this DVD to all home exercisers from Beg to Adv."
3,size is not correct,I bought a LARGE reflector vest and was very surprise to find it too SMALL. I was not comfortable sending it back because I did not want to pay for more shipping cost. I will not do business with this company anymore.
2,"nice pattern, punching is no fun","Nice pattern. Punching is no fun, in fact if I had not (a few times) seen completed ones, I would think it's impossible. I think it must take a Lot of practice. I used the pattern & thread for a needlepoint instead, that came out nicely. The big problem is that punching looks & is described as ""easy,"" when it's anything but."
2,Okay for what it is.,"The Berlitz name was not earned by products such as this. This is a series of CD's that pronounce English phrases followed by the French, repeated. For what it is the sound quality is good and the pronunciation clear. If you are new to French and looking to learn French quickly, keep looking. If you can learn French quickly from these CD's you are smart enough to not need these CD's, an English/French dictionary would suffice."
3,found at cheaper price,"Truth, as the previous reviewer said, it is all audio cds. I went to their website download the script so I can make my own notations as I listen to the cd. It's okay and I only purchased it coz I went to the Barnes & Noble website and got it for $7.99 plus tax and $3 for shipping not the $59 listed on this page."
4,Dr.Hook alone is worth a four star.,"This DVD contains various artist, and the best of it all is Dr.Hook back when they really were Dr.Hook and the medicine show..."
2,"very disappointing ""live"" performances, mostly uninteresting","I am very disappointed with this dvd. As the other reviewer mentioned, most of these performances are of ""live"" performances at German Musikladen. If the packaging had reflected this, I certainly wouldn't have purchased this dvd. I was expecting vintage music videos/lip syncing clips. Almost all of these performances are boring to my ears and don't warrant a second listen, if you can even make it through the first.The only reason I gave 2 stars rather than 1 is that some of the clothes and hair-do's are funny."
2,Organized,"I bought this organizer for my 9 year old son. It only holds 10 games (which is not nearly enough to get him through adolescence) but it also came apart. The plastic piece on the inside that holds the drawer in fell out. I examined it more closely and noticed that it had been stapled in, and not very well. The staple had fallen out and the piece fell out. The drawer comes out and makes a big mess now. Because of the tight space involved inside the game organizer it is almost impossible to fix it and is quite frustrating to try to fix."
4,Game Case,"I bought this because I am currently buying a bunch of stuff for the N64. Overall this was a good buy. It looks like I bought it when the N64 originally came out. Also, it just has that gamer look i was looking for. Once again I will honestly tell you this is a very good buy."
3,who filmed this thing?,"I am a huge DOTN fan, but what is up with this home-made quality production? It's a music-video version of the ""Blair Witch Project."" The four band members are crunched onto a poorly-lit 6'x8' stage in what seems like a local bar, and the camera work is just plain dull. Travis sings with his head down the entire time, with his hair completely blocking his face and his beautiful eyes. The occassional behind-the-scenes footage helps to relieve some of the visual monotony. The nice thing is that this video does include some great songs that are not on DOTN's two albums. Also, the videos at the end are great bonuses. If you want to hear DOTN live, it's a great soundtrack. But don't expect any stunning visuals."
2,Cheap,"I was very disappointed when this tee finally arrived. The lettering was cheap looking and the tee itself is very thin and oddly shaped (wide and short). Definitely not worth the money it will cost to return, but not worth keeping it either."
4,"Not a work of art, but entertaining","I've never been a fan of director Adrian Lyne; I've always thought he treated his female characters badly. In this one, however, he seems to have mellowed a bit. Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a married woman who falls into a love affair with a hot young French guy. I've followed Diane Lane's sporadic career for years, and she gives the best performance of her life here. The complexity of her situation is reflected on her face and in her actions. As her husband, Richard Gere is more one-note, and turns out to be the real villain of the film in my opinion--you'll have to see the movie to understand why. The movie has no real moral or lesson to teach--it just presents a compelling story of adultery with a few genuine surprises. It's not a work of art by any means, but it's entertaining, thoughtful, and has some great performances. Worth the price of admission, which is more than you can say for most of the other box-office choices this weekend."
4,"Good Story, Good Acting","If you've seen the previews, you know the movie's setup: a seemingly happily married woman (Diane Lane) cheats on her husband (Richard Gere) with a suave, mysterious stranger. There is no apparent reason for her to do so other than pure pleasure and her lover's character is deliberately kept as a stranger to the audience. The writers did a good job of not turning the film into another ""Fatal Attraction"" where there's a lot of over the top drama, insanity, and stalkers. It is realistic in terms of the manner in which the characters deal with the plot's developments and the actors effortlessly carried them out. Grown-ups will enjoy but this film may have you thinking twice about your spouse's whereabouts -- just kidding. Hey, maybe..."
4,"Good ""Life-o-Meter""......","Bottom line: If you watch the scene where Diane Lane is on the train, re-living her intimate encounter with the bookseller/sex machine....and don't notice any personal physiological changes....YOU'RE DEAD!"
4,"Lovers ""Lane"".","Overall it's an interesting and steamy film that shows the possible consequences of an affair. To my point, I'd almost give this 5 stars just for Diane Lane. This movie confirmed my thoughts that she is one of the hottest women on the planet, and whether you watch ""Unfaithful"" for her amazing acting or body, it's a must for fans of hers."
5,Steamy and dark,"""Unfaithful"" combines mystery, erotica, and drama to create this unique theme. It starts as a happy theme, but once the sexy Olivier Martinez walks into Diane Lane's life, everything changes. The sex appeal steams, then the mystery stomps on it flowing to an unexpected conclusion. The producers, the director, and the writers wonderfully make ""Unfaithful"" more entertaining.Diane Lane deserved her overdue Oscar nomination for her role as an unhappy wife, the best role of her career. Richard Gere wonderfully plays her character's suspicious husband whose personality changes as his anger grows. Olivier Martinez needs to star in more movies like this in the future.Those looking to steam up a night should watch ""Unfaithful"". It'll leave the audience breathless and shocked."
5,One of my all time fav's!!,"Diane Lane is just gorgeous and this movie is hot! Show's both sides of the story, of the unfaithful wife, and the loving and suspicious husband. Great movie!! :-)"
2,"Good acting, bad plot","This movie started out great. Diane Lane and Richard Gere did fabulous jobs. I was really getting into the wonderful portrayal of how a marriage copes with infidelity, when Richard Gere goes and murders the lover, and the whole thing went downhill from there. The story became cliche and the ending was weak. Very disappointing."
4,Almost great...,"but not quite. Diane Lane's performance was Oscar-worthy, and Richard Gere was very touching as her heartbroken husband. The whole movie was great until the dismal ending. It was disappointing and left no real ending to the story."
2,Where's the rest of the story?,"The first half was very good, steamy as is typical with an Adrian Lyne movie. However, the second half went from bad to worse. The ending was very rushed and it seemed as if someone had lost half the script, so the actors had to improvise. I have never been impressed with Diane Lane and this movie didn't change my opinion of her. Richard Gere, a wonderful actor, wasted his talents. I had expected an all around much better movie."
4,Movie so elegant only Adrian Lyne could've made it,"The plot isn't much.. The title basically says it all. The WIFE falls for a LOVER, the HUSBAND suspects yada yada yada..But its worth watching if not only to watch Diane Lane (Who never looked better).. Funny she is portraying a woman in her mid 40s while she was 36 when she shot this picture, and all her friends in the movie who were clearly in their -real- 50s commenting on how good she looked for her age.Gere gives a good performance as the HUSBAND in a very non-challenging role.. I never saw the french guy who was the LOVER but he was adequate. Still, the movie is very stylish.. It reminds me of the great Kubrick's last effort ""Eyes wide shut"" where it was described as ""style over substance"". yeah thats it."
1,what a terrible movie!,"So here we are after having read all the oh so positive reviews and after seeing it, I now understand why the reviews are positive, there is almost no story, talk about the performances and the dialogues especially the ones from Diane Lane, and I want people who haven't seen it yet that for the ""thriller"" part of it, it doesn't start before about the half of the movie which is nothing but about sex; nothing wrong with it but I don't need to go to a theater to see this. Richard Gere's performance is the only one worth seeing, the other two being just about being laid and that's about it. What a shame that US directors came to pick up that awful Oliver Martinez from us in France as if we didn't see enough of him yet! This movie is nowhere to being a classic, and is just an excuse to film some more sex for the frustrated viewers! Useless movie!"
3,Could have been great,"This movie could have been so great. You almost wish they could go back and re-film the entire last third.... Up until that moment it was subtle, beautifully acted, moving, an honest and adult portrayal of relationships under the stress of infidelity - completely riveting and realistic. Then, the absolutely jarring, horrific and truly wrong plot twist.... The film gets yanked away in the most awful direction and can never get back. Too too bad... If they would have stuck with reality, we would have had one of the best films on the topic ever made. If you watch it, shut it off just when Richard Gere gets to the lover's bedroom. The rest of it will just make you sick."
3,This Movie is Hot,"I mean HOT. Make no mistake about it: It's Hot and Steamy; you'll get a rise out of it. But the reason I gave it 3 stars was because the plot is predictable, the resulting fury of her husband when he finds out goes unpunished, she herself goes unpunished, and the movie ends lamely. Quite honestly, after I saw this movie, I couldn't stand Gere's guts."
2,Unfaithful,"I thought the movie was too intense. I am very sensitive and that is why I watch most movies at home rather than in a theatre. The acting was superb but I didn't watch it all the way through because it was getting scarier by the minute, and my heart is tooo old for that."
3,"Lane brilliant, movie annoying","Diane Lane deserves all the accolades she received for this performance, which is both moving and daring. She completely transcends the movie, which is hemmed in by Adrian Lyne's misogynistic moralizing and a melodramatic and unbelievable second half. It's hard to believe that it's a coincidence that (SPOILER of sorts) in Fatal Attraction, the family unit is left intact despite the husband's infidelity; however, if the woman strays, apparently nothing can follow but destruction and sorrow. Lane's performance hints at the movie this could have been - a mature and fascinating exploration of the impact of infidelity on a loving marriage. Definitely worth seeing, but only for her."
4,"Mon, dooyer, zis is great!","See this for the fantastic scene where Richard Gere clobbers a smug French guy over the bonce. For a full minute you are given the pleasure of seeing the blood pore down his face before he collapses in a heap on the floor. I highly recommend this film. Unfortunately, I've had to knock off a star because the film portrays Gere as feeling guilt over the death of French man and decides to turn himself in. Let's get real, people."
2,Tedious,"It says something when, in a movie about a woman's torrid extramarital affair and the problems that result, the most interesting character is a seven-year-old kid. What it says is that the movie in question - Unfaithful - is a sub-par film.In Unfaithful, Diane Lane plays a ""happily"" married woman who with little reason starts an affair with a bookseller. Despite her occasional crying spells, she doesn't really seem all that concerned about who the affair is hurting until it is too late. Richard Gere is her husband who catches on reasonably quickly and eventually takes drastic action to deal with the situation.The biggest problem with this movie is that it is boring. Even the sex scenes - and there are several of these - are rather dull. Add to this an unlikable lead character who has complete disregard for her family and it is hard to enjoy this movie. While some of the acting and writing is decent, overall, this is a tedious event and easily earns a mere two star rating."
4,about the movie unfaithful......,This story is basically about infidelty. It is about an adulterous wife played by actress Diana Lane. The sex WAS hot and intense(should be explicit full frontal nudity- censored for sale in all Singapore video shops as VCD). This is a PWC film(pass with cut) based on MDA's censoring guidelines. This is another good movie to watch.
4,Disappointing ending,"The movie started out a little slow. Richard Gere a successful business man has a house wife and kid. The wife meets a guy on the street. He interests her and she keeps going to his house to visit. Then there was a lot of s e x, but not too graphic. Then richard is like, something is not right. So he asks this guy to follow her and take pictures while he's away on a business trip. So when he gets back he sees the pics and knows where the guy lives and pays him a visit. That's as far as I'm gonna go. And all I'm gonna say about the end is that I did not like it. ""Where do you think they're going to end up?"""
4,Fatal Attraction,"The first half hour of viewing, I was thinking I was going to see a millenium version of ""Fatal Attraction"", but fortunately, Adrian Lynne switches gears and mixes it up, directing a haunting and sad, forbidden love story. All of the acting was top notch, I was especially impressed with Richard Geres performance, he did a genuine job playing a downtrodden husband. I truely felt sorry for his character. I also enjoyed the acting by the italian lover (don't know his name). He's a great actor. This film also has one of the most disturbing, real life looking murder scenes I've ever seen in film, I couldn't even watch it, I had to turn my head away form the tv. The ending of the film was a bit disappointing. It's really hard for films like this to have a spectacular ending, but overall, this was an interesting film."
2,boring movie,Why did it take the director of this movie so long to get the point across that an extra-martial affair hurts everyone involved and in the case of this movie can lead to a violent death. Half of the scenes in this movie could have been left out and the point still would have come across that no good can come of an encounter with a stanger on a windy day. I didn't need a whole movie to figure that out. This is the kind of movie to watch if you have an afternoon to waste.
3,Not Good Til The Last Drop,"This was a good idea for a movie with good actors and great directing, but the end was a disappointment. Richard Gere was great as always, but the movie took a weird turn some time in the middle and I was never able to get back into the flow of it. If you have nothing else to do and you like Richard Gere watch the movie, but if your toenails need clipping or your car needs washing I would opt for that first."
4,Good most of the time.,"The movie was good,but what made me sad was Richard Gere's character killing Diane Lane's lover's character.When I was watching this movie I was rooting for Diane Lane's character more than anyone else and I wished the affair wasn't found out.I had watched love movies in which the one having the affair is never caught.One movie is a foreign flick,The Key which was great.I give this movie a good grade but I wished the plot was different."
1,"pathetic , a nonsense movie","Well , i sat on the chair , and all i could see was betrayal , sextual contents ,and broken hearts . I didn't find any sense to that movie , other than its a waste of time . And all the excitement in watching that movie was gone in the 1st 30 minutes ."
1,"this is a mopey ,chick flick","This movie stinks!Richard Gere portrays a loser ... An actor of his caliber and rep was miscast.Diane Lane has an affair but, big deal!The movie takes a ridiculous plot turn and the ending is anti-climactic and unsatisfying.One know what the movie is really about? A person that a woman elects to have an affair with is good for just the affair...he, like, really has no value (especially in this movie...he, meaning his life, is expendable)A very over rated movie!"
2,"Hmm, well, it's kinda ...","Act 1 : Let's watch Diane Lane get accosted by the windAct 2: Let's watch Diane Lane have sexAct 3: In case you missed Act 2, lets' do it againAct 4: Closeup: Wife guilt face, husband dope faceAct 5: Need some more sex to perk it upThen it gets really stupid. And dull! This movie is no thriller. It plays like and strong R rated version of a lifetime movie. After a while the sex is even boring to look at. Wait for cable, don't even rent it."
1,A FRENCHMEN?????,"I think Diane lane is one of the most attractive women in hollywood, but this movie was stupid it left me cheering for RICHARD freaking GEERE, please. She cheated on him with a frechman???? the only thing lower would be going to beastility. I was forced to sit threw this vile peace of garbage with my date, but when Geere smacked that cheese eating surrender monkey with the snow globe I stood up in my living room and cheered."
4,Surprisingly good,"Richard Gere and Diane Lane play an older couple whose marriage is shattered by Lane's affair with a seductive Frenchman played by Olivier Martinez. Director Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal; I guess he loves directing these types of films) makes Lane and Martinez' sexual chemistry believeable and erotic without being explicit, and Lane gives the performance of her career. Gere is in a welcome change of pace as the devoted husband who suffers the pain of being cheated on, and he gives a great performance in a role which I originally thought he would have been miscast in. Though the film may be a bit too long for its' own good, all in all, Unfaithful is a great erotic thriller that keeps you watching until the final frame of film."
5,Complacency Infatuation Infidelity Destruction,"This is a great tale of infidelity brought on by feelings of complacency. However, this film focuses and explores the notion of complacency foremost and not really the act of infidelity. Is complacency just a temporary state of mind or not? Does it take a catastrophic event to jar the person out of this temporary state that leads one to infatuate? Complacency leads to infatuation, which leads to infidelity. Infidelity leads to destruction and reality. This is an excellent film. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are brilliant."
4,Good But Sad,"I was not disappointed with the acting of any of the three main characters here. The movie moves at a quick pace and tells the story of a woman who is otherwise happy with her life, making a careless, stupid mistake.I'm sure this is the same scenario played behind closed doors all over the place, until the climax of the story. I won't spoil it for others here, but what happens is traumatic and sad.I would have given this 5 stars, but I didn't like the murkiness of the ending. However, I recommend it to those who want to get a glimpse into the reasons behind and terrible consequences of infidelity."
5,"a study in acting, if nothing else...","This is an excellent movie mostly because of the virtuoso performance by Diane Lane. Even Richard Gere is good as her sympathetic husband. The movie is somewhat weak on plot and is similiar to a movie like Kramer v Kramer in that it is more just a glimpse of a situation someone happens to be in. There are only a couple of ways a movie like this can end, and, without spoiling it, the ending is really no surprise. Still, because of the great acting and Adrian Lynn's steady directing, it's worth seeing as a very well made movie"
1,Unfaithful - uninteresting,"An incredibly boring reinactment demonstrating the pitfalls of adultery and betrayal. Thirty minutes into the movie and I simply didn't care about any of the characters. Yes, Diane Lane's performance is good, but it is surrounded by a story that is so boring and predictable they should prescribe it for insomniacs."
1,lame,"this is a chick movie and barely a thriller. Lane plays the part of the bored housewife, Gere the impotent husband. Then comes Martinez, the cute frenchman who says the right things at the right time. Straight out of a romance novel. I also thought certain parts of this movie was just sick and twisted. I mean the whole snow globe thing? Huh? And the mexico thing at the end? who wrote this? Lane, gere, martinez... good performances.. but the writing is just horrid. Unbelievable [...]"
2,Very disappointing and shallow,"To this viewer this movie, despite the good acting job by Diane Lane, was very disappointing, rather formulaic. The ending is horrible and could happen only in the movies. The characters just weren't developed well and were rather stereotypical, not getting much below the surface except for some maudlin moments thrown in for effect. Richard Gere's talent is wasted in this silly story. I must admit, though, that I liked the little boy and his personality."
2,Tedious and completely unbelievable,"Diane Lane is a beautiful housewife. She is not unhappy. She is not bored. She loves her husband and their son. But we are expected to believe that she would fling herself into an affair with an unattractive, scuzzy-lookin' French guy after knowing him for, oh, about ten minutes. Gimme a break! Lane's performance is pretty good, but Richard Gere is fairly awful as the wronged husband fighting for his self-control. The kid is played by one of the Malcolm in the Middle kids, who looks absolutely nothing like a child Lane and Gere would possibly have together. After long, boring tedium, the movie ends with -- ta daa!!! -- SYMBOLISM!!! Yawn."
3,Start with a Bang...Ended as a Flat Line,I don't get it...This movie (about a highly toxic love triangle) started off strong--it literally had me pinned to the television. Then it just tanked and FLAT LINED!In ending of this film was just way too soft to justify the initial explosion.
3,Didn't quite live up to all the hype...,"I really expected to enjoy this movie based on the hoopla surrounding Diane Lane's performance. However, when it was all over I wasn't all that moved and was left with several questions, such as: 1.) Why did she cheat? 2.) How will they ever get away with ""it"" when so many people have seen Diane Lane's character and the Frenchman together (Richard Gere's disgruntled employee, the private investigator, another female character I presume was the Frenchman's wife)? While I enjoyed much of the cinematography (the wind sequence was absolutely beautiful) and seeing Richard Gere playing against type, I still just didn't get what was so great. In fact, I saw this as another vehicle made to show gratitutious sex and then laud an Oscar nomination on the female lead. Anyone remember Halle Berry in ""Monster's Ball""?"
3,Made Me A Nervous Wreck! Not A First Date Movie,"I wasn't expecting a good movie, I'll admit it. I was expecting more Hollywood churned out assembly line garbage. This isn't garbage at all, it was refreshingly edgy.I was suprised to say the least. It takes a lot to put me on edge. This movie succeeded. I was a nervous wreck. Especially when Diane Lane starts acting shady and gives herself away. I was talking to the movie, screaming she was gonna give herself away, lol, much to the dismay of my date.Adrian Lynne does a beautiful direction job. It reminded me of ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" meets ""Fatal Attraction"".The love making scenes really are super hot too!My only beef is the deleted scenes are better than the scenes in the movie. Make sure you check out the alternative ending! Much better.This isn't a first date movie. If you end up giving the cheating wife pointers on how not to get caught, it may make you look like a pro, a-hem.I give it 3 1/2 stars."
1,good....and very bad,"(maybe spoiler ahead)I don't want to spoil anybody, but well, it is just an opinion, right?I don't know if this is a remake or something but I got to tell you, this movie was dissapointing. The first hour is ok, growing the intense atmosphere of infidelity by the wife and then without reason the movie it turns out in a crime (accidental), cold cover up. It is not credible. For me anyway. :)Well, YMMV."
2,"I only read in spanish, the movie don't have subtittles.","I like to wacht movies with subtitles in spanish, but movies downloand for internet don't have subtitles . You need resolve this problem."
4,Nice!,"For its age it is a really good movie. The stray, the lust, the lies, the cover-up(the attempt), the reckoning, the repentance, the re-unite it all was brilliantly put together. I mean some of the things was a little over board but hey, its a movie. That's what fantasizing is all about right! The actors and actresses all played their roles brilliantly. Regarding the streaming, there was only one interruption for buffering after that all went well. I will give the whole experience four and half stars!"
4,"Oh, this is just lovely.","This band kind of reminds me of a baby Collide - a younger and more underground version of that band's gothic and industrial fusion with powerful female vocals and a strong sense of spirituality and mysticism. What makes Ego Likeness stand out is the earnestness of their lyrics and delivery, and the Southern-tinged storytelling theme of the album. While they can be a bit overwrought at times, this music is beautiful, energising, and worth playing in many different settings. I greatly look forward to their next album. My favourite tracks include the title cut, ""Mandala"", ""Hurricane"", and ""Wolves""."
5,"An Amazing Band, Amazing Album!","Ego Likeness do it good. Real good. Definitely for rockers that like a darker but mellow edge to their music.Atmospheric, sexy, with both male and female vocals.Check out this CD, you won't regret it!"
5,Ego Likeness,"Ego Likeness is a good band, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes easy listening, trip hop, soft electronic, or the band Collide."
2,Dismayed by quality of product.,"Cons:Well I was not impressed by the reel at all. I passed on buying the exact same one as I received at our local ACE hardware as it's construction was chintzy. I assumed theMARKSMART TWINE REEL WITH 638 FT HEAVY DUTY NYLONreel would be of a higher quality. Also it is not the same design as shown in the pic. I kept it as it was it not worth the time and money of returning it. It will work, just underwhelmed by its construction.Pros: Did arrive in a timely manner and Collegiate Pacific did respond quickly with a Return Authorization should I have decided to return it."
4,Great Book!,"We often over look WWI due to time and Great Wars that followed, but WOW! War is hell, specially this one."
3,OK - but hardly a classic,"Mackin's memoir of his experiences as a Marine in the First World War was good, but not great. The experiences he shares are not uncommon to fighting men in any war, which makes the book seem a little cliched. I was also irritated by his references to himself in the third person (""the kid""). With that said, however, it is one of only a handful of memoirs by Americans who served in France, and as such is worthy of attention."
2,Great Idea ruined by lousy story telling .,"If you are expecting a shapechanger story - forget this one. Although we learn the hero can change into wolf, he never does! All we have is the heroine upset that he can, but other then that it has nothing to do with the story. Totally wasted as a concept. Another problem is that there is almost no dialog in the book. Everything in this book is described and usually after the fact.There is no drama whatsoever. Even when the characters talk, most of it is just description as in ""What's that?"", ""It's a ... This book is really inferior."
5,Worth having a sleepless night,"I started this book at 10 pm and couldn't let it out of my hands until 4.30 am. WOW! I loved Mrs. Dawson style. It is not like those cheesy books that are only good for being able to fall asleep or when you have a cold. This book transfers you into another world, another culture. If you like adventure, mysteries, archeologic explorers and the idea of hidden cultures (hmmm... and a wonderful love story) you will enjoy this book. I dreamed about the Black Mountains and started sketching in the morning - the first time since a year. Thank you Mrs. Dawson."
5,Do you have loose ends?,"The sequel to the debut ""Ties That Bind"" is wonderful. When I finished Ties, I just knew I had to read ""Loose Ends"" to find out what was going to happen to everyone. In this sequel Parks introduces a new character Kree who is almost strangely identical to Mia, Brice's ex-wife. This book has twists and turns and even after you read this book, you still want more. Just like Ties, Loose ends is also a book that many of us can relate too. Even thought this book is fictional, the drama that happens in the book is the same drama that most people go through everyday. I recommend this book to anyone that has had to deal with an abusing spouse or significant other and found themselves torn between love and self dignity and then finally finding out what true love is all about through someone else. Even if it is your ex-husband's best friend. A DEFINITE MUST READ!!!!"
4,Even Better Than The First One!,More drama! Man talk about a soap opera! I think I like this sequel better because SOMEBODY finally stood up to Brice. Loose Ends is a very compelling and engaging read. I finished this one in one day too.
4,You've gotta get both books at the same time....,"I bought both ""The Ties That Bind"" and ""Loose Ends"" at the same time and I am glad that I did. After flying through ""The Ties That Bind"" I jumped strait into ""Loose Ends"". With all the emotion, and suspense of the first book I couldn't help but need to read this one too. ""Loose Ends"" really completes the story and leaves you feeling satisfied. The characters that you grew to both love and hate in ""The Ties That Bind"" make ever more mistakes (never thought that was possible) and eventually get themselves together. Buy It!!"
5,Riveting Sequel,"This novel was even better than the first book but let me tell you Mia had me so mad at her choices in this book that I could spit. But like I said Electa knows what she is doing and does a great job telling the reader what happens five years later when Chritian, Mia and Brice meet up again. She even adds some new flavor to the story by the name of Kree. Well done Electa. Although this was the sequel I would like to see how these same characters are doing in five more years."
5,GREAT BOOK!,I first read The Ties That Bind... It left me wanting MORE... Loose Ends picks up where Ties... left off. I read it in 1 day. Very well written. Mrs. Parks has a gift and I look forward to her next book! THIS IS A MUST READ!Tabatha
5,Even Better the Second Time Around!,"Ms. Park's Loose Ends was even better than it's predecessor! She bought back some old friends (Mia, Christian and Brice) and continued their saga. She introduced us to a new character in the person of Kree.She tied up some unresolved issues and made some interesting new dilemnas come to light. Ends was a quick, fast and easy read that made you love and hate at the same time!Ms. Parks is an author whom everyone should include in their library. I look forward to future wonderful stories with interesting protagonists from her. WRITE ON MS. PARKS!!God bless you and may you continue to thrill us with your riveting stories!!"
4,Mia had to be crazy,"I liked this book. I could not beleive Mia cheated with Brice after all he put her threw. Christain was a good man, and I am glad they found there way back to each other. However, I do beleive she should have told us more about what was going on with them."
4,"It needs to ""click"" off/on","It's totally fine. I like the nite lite feature. But unlike our previous version, this must be clicked to turn off, versus a smooth glide. Not really any big deal. Easy to install. Works as intended."
5,HELP ME PLEASE!!,i am not really a fan of Punk rock but my husband is and i have been doing backfilps for two weeks trying to get a whole of this CD for a reasonable amount of cash. out anniversary is in a couple of weeks and he would just love nothing more than to have this CD in his collection. he is a true misfits fan and i please ask you to find me a copy so i could make his dreams come true.
1,How long is it??,"The length of the border should be included w/ the description so that parents can figure out how many to buy to go around the nursery. I have registered for this item, but have no clue as to how long the border is, therefore have no idea how many borders to register for."
3,"Sacred, Los Lonely Boys",This album was a bit disappointing. The songs just sound too much alike. The first CD they put out is a superior set of songs with more variety in the mood and tempo.
5,Here to STAY!,"Sacred finds the Boys in excellent form. This second CD does not disappoint at all. If anything, it surprises by the fact that the Boys have gotten even better than anyone thought possible, including those of us who had heard many of the songs in concert. Sacred has the same great guitar rifts, melodies and harmonies as the self-titled CD but with a deeper, more mature overall sentiment and the addition of new instruments. My personal favorite, My Loneliness, combines spiritual lyrics with a haunting melody to create a song of extraordinary beauty. This one uplifts the soul. The CD has a wonderful blend of fun, feel good songs such as Diamonds, Oye Mamacita and Texican Style combined with spiritual gems such as My Loneliness, Home, One More Day, Orale, and the defiant My Way and Living My Life. Sacred proves that these Boys are here for the long haul, Thank God!!"
5,Los Lonely Boys ARE Sacred!,"What a fine album from ""The Boys."" They continue their Texican style with wonderful lyrics and great performances. Wow!"
3,Good But Not Great,"The LLB's are at the crossroads. Do they do the more pop oriented material that made them famous? Do they jam, which the do a little more on this release. This effort is enjoyable and well worth it for the Texas Guitar style crowd. The songwriting is not quite as crisp however the musicianship is tighter. No Top 40 here for the pop crowd."
3,rare,"Los Lonely Boys released their sophomore album Sacred this summer. This texican band mixes Spanglish with blue-sy rock and Santana inspired guitars. The album didn't get as much hype as it deserves most likely because the single released was dull and cheesy. Though I have great respect for them and their music, Diamonds doesn't deliver. Songs that do are; `Oye Mamacita' and `Outlaws'. this album also includes a few live tracks which only prove their raw talent which is rare in the music industry at this point in time."
3,More good music,"Same uniquely Lonely Boys sound. Interesting mix of 50's, country and rock. I just happen to like the first album better."
5,"Sophomore blues? Yeah, right!","Los Lonely Boys (los Hermanos del Garza, if I may be allowed to practice my rudimentary Spanish) have a knack: combining expert musicianship with catchy rhythms/lyrics. The result is spectacular--their debut album was a knock-out, and their sophomore effort only continues to display their many talents.From heartbreak to eternal love, to divine devotion, SACRED is an album of...well, sanctity. These three gentlemen seem to worship their music, to thrive on their melodies...and we can only thank them for it. The songs here are just as enjoyable as those on the first (there's no instrumental this time around, but the guys get enough picking/playing room to display their versitile talents), and the duet with father Enrique Sr. and Willie Nelson is pure outlaw enjoyment (good thing the song is entitled ""Outlaws""). SACRED is a true rock/Tejano/Texicano/country/blues record...it is an album celebrating the virtues of music, by 3 of the most talented musicians today."
4,LLB - Sacred,"Before buying ""Sacred"", I had some fears that the album would be overly-commercial and might even scream ""sellout"", given the huge success of their debut. But thankfully it doesn't.Sacred builds on the group's debut album nicely. The Texican blues/rock/rock en espanol/Stevie Ray Vaughan touches are all still there. There's more instrumentation than the debut, which is a nice addition. The songs are all very catchy - but again, without being too catchy or cheesy. The lyrics and rhyming are somewhat predictable at times, but really, who cares when they sound this good?I give Los Lonely Boys a lot of respect for writing their own songs, playing their own instruments, and co-producing the album. These guys are very talented musicians. I would definitely recommend Sacred to lovers of ""good music""."
5,Bounce Bounce To Buy This NOW,"Ever since I heard Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz and Pastor Troy, I've liked dirty south crunk music more than any other form of rap. And Miracle is no exception. He holds it down with his tight beats and rhymes.Some hot tracks off it are 'Bounce', 'We Fittin To Do This', 'We Aint Scared', and 'Momma'. All of them are tight, those are just the ones I keep switching between now :-) Its hot!If you like Pastor Troy, Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, Drama, Dirty, Three 6 Mafia, or any of the Cash Money clique, you will love this! Buy it NOW!"
2,2 Stars for 2 Good Songs!,"Well to start, I'm not a fan of Miracle and Pastor Garbage, also known as Pastor Troy, and with this album it proves why they dont have alot of fans. This album brings nothing except hard knockin beats. Miracle cant rap. Just listen to his voice. That is irratating. It was in a interview that he said he made his album in 12 days. 12 DAYS! Come on now. You cant make a good album in 12 days. The 2 songs that get tha 2 stars are: We fittin to do this, and P & D. And that's about it. Miracle needs to give it up, cause whoever told him he can rap............THEY LIED! And ONE more thing. People who read this review might say that I'm a hater, but I'm not. I just know good music when I hear it and this aint a good album. But on tha other hand if you got a tight system in yo trunk, go head and pick this album up, cause it'll keep tha system knockin. If you want some quality music go and get that 504 Boyz. YA HEARD ME!~!~!"
1,"Buy Pastor Troy's CD ""We Ready I Declare War"" instead","This fool is just a biter of Pastor Troy... he acts like he's all boys with PT when the two have never even met.1 miracle stole pastor troy's style 2 miracle raps about the same topics PT does 3 miracle does the bounce remix and says PT contributed to the song when he didnt. Miracle just stole his verses and put them on his song so it would look like there were tight 4 miracle said ""F.U."" to PT on this album 5 every song title on miracle's album can be heard in PT's verses on his album ""I declare War"" 6 miracle got on BET acting like an a$$hole talking bout he started that sh!t when he didnt 7 on rap city he was saying all and i mean ALL of PT's catch phrases. 8 PT gonna rip in a new one on the new Pastor Troy CD ""I am DSGB""This rapper Miracle is just some fool doing an impersonation of Pastor troy... just buy ""We Ready I Declare War"" for the best CD ever."

4,Fast Microwavable Meal,"Only small portion of rice in this product is wild rice, and tiny flakes of dehydrated mushrooms represent the ""mushroom."" The taste is all right in my opinion. But I do agree that this dish is a bit on the dry side. It probably is not a big deal if you keep a bottle of sauce handy."
5,By cracky I LOVE this movie!!!,"I was just a year old when this came out. But since then I must have viewed it on my elbows more than twenty times. And I still get cold chills even now. Now admit it, if you can watch something that many times it has to have some appeal. Course it may be just me. But I'm sure my likeminded clones out there have the same feelings as I do. Don't you guys. See? You said yes didn't you?"
5,Great Classic Sci-Fi :-),"This is one of those timeless Science Fiction movies; no matter how many times I've seen it, I still enjoy watching it.If you love classic Sci-Fi, get this one. You won't be sorry. :-)"
3,Not Bad......,"Eat your vegetables before they eat you? Some parts of this film are a bit dull and the characters aren't too interesting (Title character exempt), but it's a great movie to sit back and unwind with. Take a trip back to those movies like this on Saturday morning TV. I would like to see this in the theater someday."
1,Overrated Letdown,This is a prime example of an overrated film which is essentially a letdown made up of an inane plot and near zero budget(which explains why there is basically no special effects worth mentioning and a darned cheesy monster costume in the show).Thankfully this film has been out of production for a really longggg time and that fact alone tells you that it does not deserve your moolahs.Stick with the 1982 version by John Carpenter. That is a -real- classic.
1,Downright boring.,"This film would only appeal to stubborn old folks 60 and above. Christ, this movie is 48 years old and it is not even true to the book it was based on! Instead, this film is fraught with a cast of forgettable characters, a big man in a killer carrot monster suit and overly-dramatic drivel as main dialogue.If you want a real scare and a far more decent adaption of ""Who goes there?"", try ""John Carpenter's The Thing"". It is lightyears ahead of its time and will send true jitters down your spine no matter how many unrealistic CGI monsters of today, or silly monster suits of the past, you have seen in cinema.Again, stay away from this 50's ""classic"" unless you are a senior citizen feeling downright nostalgic."
2,BIG Disappointment.,"what is good about this film?? With a big tall men acting like a maniac. Everyone's acting is also too comical. The only good about this film is I guess it is considered as a ""classic"". Nothing more. So, I guess I am FORCED to give TWO stars. There are TONS of better scar movies out there which were made in the 50s. Forget it....I was very disappointed."
2,Not that good IMHO.,"I don't like this film because of the unwarranted hype! I would probably have liked it better if I were not so fired up by those positive reviews at Amazon.com because this film is not even a fraction of what that have been described about it!!!! Sorry folks but truly none whatsoever.. Maybe my earlier expectations shot thru' the roof since I did not know better than to trust the questionable reviews here. But all I can say is this, this film may appeal to some and is actually not too bad but at the same time, it is not great either. I think the word ""cult"" is a great misnomer for this movie. Renting this movie would be a wiser move than buying it."
5,If you have ever read the original book,"--------- Then you will be shocked, to see that the remakes of this, are more faithful to the book, than this version. Yep, really shocked me when I read it. But I am of the mind to say, this first film version - remains superior for actually suspense and downright creepy chills. Very (!) well scripted and fans of older films will spot lots of familiar faces. Goes to show that CGI ain't what makes a film - acting/plot/music -- etc---for this film beats the CGI aspect and the story is done in a way, you can relate to it on a more visceral level -- so the creepy vibe, really sets in. You cannot tell it just by the cover, so rent and check it out but I won't hesitate to say for the price, buy it."
4,Excellent Horror Classic!,These classic movies had character. And the storylines are superb. Special FX are pretty good for it's day. I highly recommend this classic!
1,These people are lying to you!,"Don't believe the ""glowing"" reviews that some people have written here...this 'Thing' stinks! I would put this movie somewhere below 'The Blob', as far as overall quality and entertainment value. There's just too many holes in in the plot to be ignored! A lot good sci-fi movies that came out in the 50's, but this isn't one of them!"
5,THE THING,"IT WORK REAL GOOD. I LIKE OLD HORROR MOVIES THE OTHER 2 I HAD TO SEND BACK , IT JUST DIDN'T WORK TO GOOD , I HOPE IN GET ABBOTT AND COSTELL MOVIS"
5,The Thing,"This movie is a true classic. It's well written, directed, and the acting is superb. I love the light-hearted banter among the characters."
5,Better in Black and White,"After watching The Thing at least a dozen times over the years in BW, I thought I'd give the colorized version a try. Not bad; in fact, the creature looks pretty good in (guess what) green. Of course the direction and acting remain outstanding. So my rating is for the BW version with the color getting four because it distracts from the plot's tension and suspense."
5,Brings back memories of black and white late night creature feature.,"Loved this movie growing up....and still love watching it. Some movies just stand the test of time, and this one is one of the best. Watched it with my kids and they just laughed about the lack of special effects. I told them back in the days of Black and White movies, the actors actual had to do some acting, that most movies today are just smoke and mirrors. Buy this movie if you really enjoy classic sci-fi, you wont regret it.And yes, this is the Black and White version. Wish they did Black and White and Colorized version on same DVD."
5,Great Classic SciFi Movie at a great price.,"Great Classic SciFi Movie at a great price. Arrived really quick too. In less than a week. Classic 1950s SciFi. How often do you see Marshal Matt Dillion play a movie monster, and doesn't even get a speaking part."
5,THE 50s Sci Fi Classic of All Time,"I'll never forget that walk home in the dark with my cousin after watching ""The Thing."" This classic Howard Hawks thriller chills you with an idea rather than an image. Why the copyright holder is withholding publication and re-release is surely a mystery to me. From my and other comments here, it is quite apparent that there is a significant market for the film. Let's get it back in production!!!!"
5,The Thing from another world,The movie was good in color even better then when I first seen it in black and white on TV.Scientist on the north pole track what appears to be A UFO then crashes into the ice they set out to find it and when they do they accidently destroy it.But they do find A passenger from the ship who was frozen over after cutting it out.Well lets just say trouble starts for are human cast.
5,"Fun horror story, not much gore, but lots of love and friendship","A love story predominates in this movie, and The Thing is just thrown in for some chills and fun. The romance between Margaret Sheridan and Kenneth Tobey seems very real. I suspect Tobey really liked Sheridan off camera as well as on. The monster, played by Gunsmoke TV series star James Arness, is just thrown in so Tobey can be the hero for female star Sheridan. The movie makes fun of professors, some of whom are so stupid some of them get themselves killed, though off-screen. A fun horror-love story was common in the early 1950s. The picture is great if you like love stories with a little chills thrown in."
3,Comical and laughable in today's standards,"This movie may have been a thriller in it's day, but almost 60 years of Sci-Fi and Horror have managed to numb those of us that are hard-core horror fans. Having said that, it is an enjoyable weekend movie that's actually family friendly. It should be noted this movie scared my Father In-Law so much when he was still a teen that to this day he cannot and will not watch a horror movie. I can only laugh."
3,"It's O.K., for an Old Classic","For an old '50's Horror Classic, ""The Thing form Another World"" is still a good old ""Late, Late Show"" standard(if you can still find such on cable, anymore.) Since the advent of CGI and other special effects, ""Thing"" is definitely a relic of the past.I'm definitely showing signs of encroaching old age,and it's accompanying disillusionment; I saw this oldy at least a half dozen times as a kid, and was scared spitless at age 10, but now, compared to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", this one is barely a live action cartoon, sad to say."
4,Out of this world!,"The thing is classic sci-fi. Cold war fears at it's best. The remake has all the great visual effect, but you can't beat the orignal for 50's charm."
4,AN EXCELLENT CLASSIC,"This one is an excellent classic, and keeps you in focus with an original script. I saw it when i was a kid and now I enjoyed it again. !!"
5,Still Scary Today,"Remember when this movie was made, 1950's. What is unbelievable is that you rarely ever get a good look at the monster (James Arness), he is in and out of scenes quickly but he is ALWAYS THERE. Same thing holds true with the movie Jaws, you do not need to see the monster in every scene. Today's movies you need the monsters in every scene. The premise of the movie is that a flying spaceship lands in the artic and is recovered by a scientific team and air force people working there. The music is even creepy. Watching this late at night at home will give you the creeps, if you let your imagination run wild. Some of the lines in the movie are classics, ""they did not breed him for beauty"", ""watch the sky"", ""I didn't get a good look, do you want me to open the door again?"" The characters are great, especially Dr. Carrington and his staff who has many character actors who went onto other great roles. Very good movie for then and now."
4,More suspense than you might think and without gore,"This movie brought back many memories. It was suspenseful, did not have any real gore and was fun to watch."
2,Sub-par VidAmerica VHS,"THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) is a genuine classic sci-fier, however this VIDAMERICA tape is NOT, thus the two-star rating.VIDAMERICA dubbed their VHSs at slower speeds, which means picture clarity suffers.For a superior videotape transfer of this monster movie favorite, your best bet isWARNER's 1993 edition."
4,The Thing #1,A very suspenceful movie that leaves much to your own imagination. Infinitely better than the 1980's remake.
5,"Arguably, the best science fiction ever made","A masterpiece.The world anxiously awaits this movie to be released on Blu-ray.My favorite characters are Scotty and Nicky.It's interesting to watch this movie with children (over age 12 in my opinion).There's a scene where the men go door to door looking for ""The Thing"". Great suspense without the gore! Too bad Hollywood has forgotten how to make these kinds of terrific movies."
5,Not Anti-Communist Propganda,"It boggles the mind how anyone could see in this movie anti-communist propaganda. Anyone who saw this film knows that the ""thing"" was, in fact, a bloodthirsty, warmongerling, imperialist bent on conquering the world. That's the exact opposite of a communist--ask any liberal. By the way, since when has Hollywood made any anti-communist movies? Remember they also said the same thing about ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Are too many people who watched this movie a little paranoid themselves? Are they afraid that they and their ""fellow-travelers"" might be exposed as the fiendish alien monsters that they are?"
4,Wasn't it James Arness?,"I thought James Arness from Gunsmoke (and brother to Peter Graves, I'm sure you all know) played the creature in the original ""Them? Am I confusing it with another 50's sci-fi/horror flick? [...]. Thanks, Ted"
3,The Thing is the thing,"My wife has long enjoyed & sought The Thing. Oddly, it is her favorite Mother's Day present."
4,Appears good quality; big,"I haven't used this pack yet. Bought 2 of these. When they arrived I was impressed by the size. They appear to be good quality. Have loaded them up with 60 lbs so far and this pack doesn't seem even close to yielding no matter if I hold it by a single shoulder strap or the hanging hook loop.This pack is really only suitable for it's intended use: for hauling big loads: I say this because I saw a comment before I purchased stating that it collapses down small enough for a day-hike. Not true: this thing is huge: the waist straps alone would be an annoyance to anyone who wasn't using them to help support the pack's load; They are very broad and thick and one wouldn't want to deal with them if they weren't being used (unless you want an extra layer of insulation around your waist). Also: they don't appear to reduce down to less than a 34"" waist or so: not a concern for winter usage with a parker and layers on underneath that would increase your waist size."
4,great pack for the money,"i have used this pack twice now for long hikes and overnight camping out in the colorado rockies. my girlfriend got the explorer 55 and fits her perfect, so being 6'5"" i went with the larger pack. her pack fits me and the long trail 90 fits me too. the 90 has more pockets on the outside than the 55, and holds a ton more stuff, which makes it a lot heavier. i haven't used the water reservoir pocket yet except to put my flashlight in, not sure if all reservoirs will fit or not. had a sqeaking issue, but then just kept readjusting it while hiking and it went away. the zippers seem strong so far and the material is surprisingly stronger than it looks. both of the packs are super adjustable, so i think it really must come down to how much can you haul and how much do you WANT to haul. you can pretty much take the whole campsite in the 90, but it will weigh as much as the mountain youre hiking..."
3,Hiking the AT,"The backpack has lots of space to carry all the necessary items for a longer hike on the Appalachian Trail, which amounted to about 45 pounds.However, the weight caused the straps , especially around the waist and shoulder, to slide out of position, which made me constantly retension the straps....kind of annoying.....Luckily I had some duct tape with me(don't leave home without it), helping to temporarily solve the problem...I would strongly advise the manufacturer to improve/solve the overall strap problem."
5,High Sierra long trail 90,"Bought this for camping trips and maybe some fishing and backpacking trips. I picked it because it had a large capacity and fit the style I was looking for, came with a lifetime warranty. When it arrived I was pleased it had many pockets and loops and straps to put in all my gear, I fit my tent, sleeping bag and mat, fishing gear, clothes, and snacks in it. Also it seems to be good quality, I was excited with all the things it would hold and that I could attach to it!"
4,Appalachian Trail Pack it is NOT,"I am filled with mixed emotions about this pack. I bought it to hike the Appalachian trail this Spring after prep-hiking with a smaller pack.The SIZE of this pack allowed me to pack way too much weight, the pack itself is incredibly heavy for Long Distance Hiking. For a local Hike of a few nights it is great, but a Long Distance bag needs to be much lighter.The CONSTRUCTION of the bag is fantastic. I beat the stuffing out of this bag on the Trail. Not a single stitch was loosend. The zippers held up without pinching up. The bag held water out very well.I ended up using the sleeping bag compartment for easy access to stuff bags for food and my Jet Boil. Stuffing the sleeping bag into the main compartment."
4,Bug out bag,"The High Sierra Long Trail 90 will soon be packed full of survival equipment should the need arise. The main compartment is accessible through both the top and bottom. 10 of the 90 are from a fanny pack that is removable, but I will keep it on top of the bag because it will better protect the gear inside. This is due to the use of a drawstring rather than a zipper being used to close the top of the main compartment. Lots of places to hang tools or water bottles. Looks great, but gave 4 stars because it has not yet been field tested."
5,great pack,"Great bag! lots of space, easy to carry. Takes all the load off when you properly have it fit to you. Room for a week or more of gear depending on what you need. Great bag and strong materials."
4,"This is America, Charlie Brown",It's been an engaging way to incorporate music in our Social Studies. My students love the cartoon format and I'm thrilled with the educational content.
3,good item - but ridiculous price!,"This was exacatly what my wife wanted, so in that regard I was happy to find it for her - but the price charged was (and is!) ridiculous! When it was originally issued it sold for about $20 - $90 or so for this copy is highway robbery. I hope someone reissues it soon, so individuals who stockpile them and sell at outrageous markups when the supply gets low have to sit on their inventory instead of taking advantage of everyone!"
2,Not as fun as you'd think,"I got this for my fifth grade class. It's better than the social studies textbook, but not fun. I'll probably have to make worksheets to go with it. Basically a kid reads a history report as a voice-over while the Peanuts kids occasionally do something."
5,No one can fault this !,"I know there are people who barely remember these when they came out but since I am presently living in the U.K. with my hubby , it is GREAT way to teach the kids (youngsters) about the U.S.A. and keep them glued to the television. I forot alot of things about MY own history which were mentioned in this set, such as in the Apollo Space craft episode and that bit about good ol Charlie Brown and Snoopy bit ( ya have to watch it yaself) ...THAT took me back years in school rooms far away. It is a great deal for the price although it may seem out of date for the times we live in today it is a definite MUST HAVE for any Charlie Brown and Snoopy fan!! If it bores you than you are definitely NOT a TRUE die hard fan!"
2,"too little art, too many ads","I have subscribed to this magazine in the past along with other art periodicals. If you take this magazine and remove the advertisements, you will have 80% of the content gone. There are some good articles. But this magazine has lost its way. I no longer subscribe."
1,Would love to receive this publication.,I ordered and paid for this Art Publication on Feb. 10th. Apparently it takes up to 10 weeks to receive the 1st issue. Today is March 21st and I'm still waiting to receive.
1,clever but stupid,"Surely , other than Madonna, no act has shifted so many albums on the basis of so little talent. Like all of their output, this has all the excitement of a wet sunday in Rhyll. ( American readers can provide their own dull-town analogy. Newark maybe) A sustained exercise in clever promotion and sleight of hand. Musically of no interest. Cant sing or play anything? Never mind, Pick up the phone Neil and hire a top producer/ghost writer/musicians your artful weilding of your cheque-book will more tha compensate for any talent. Tennent and The Other One ( whose role can only be surmised) make about as much input into ""their"" records as Britney did into ""Toxic"", ie a little thin vocal somewhere in the mix. Kings not- very- new- clothes folks."
4,Good Fantasy adventure,"This book: ""Bloodspiller"" written by Isa Rodack, is a good example of fantasy fiction. With little of the classic ""hero"" plotline and some interesting twists, Bloodspiller is a sure bet. Now where is the next book in the series?"
1,From frustrated International Teaching Assistant,"I really do not understand the purpose of the book ""Language and Culture"" by Claire Kramsch. The author takes some rather basic ideas and obscures them with complicated terms that no one in the world except for some (to general public unknown) anthropologists care about. I understand these ideas - most of them are simple e.g., that a foreign student with a good comprehension of English can still misunderstand a text because of an unfamiliarity with the culture. But why should I as an engineering student, or any other student for that matter need to waste their ""precious time"" (as Americans say) learning little known or cared for terms with petty terminology. I could go on with other nonsenses that appear in the book, but I do not think that it is worth."
3,Non-technical look at Gates' view of the near future,"Most useful as a look at the distillation of Gates' thinking about the computer industry. Recent paperback revision is more up to date on the Web and Internet issues.Gates is a student of the industry, with a keen mind. He is in the inner circles that are creating next generation programs and hardware. Interesting (but not thrilling) to share his insights"
1,not as interesting as you'd think,"this book seems to be just an empty generalization with little real insight. for being written by someone who has had a part in revolutionizing the world it is actually quite dull. searching amazon.com gives one more idea of the direction the world is going and how the future might unfold. luckily gates gives us something far more valuable with MS Windows as a tool for finding ""the road ahead"""
3,ObliGATEd to respond,"It's rough being a billionaire. It makes others play free and loose with criticism. My hat's not off but I'm not wielding a cattle prod either. Bill Gates has a right to be somewhat proud of his accomplishments. His writing is straightforward and the tone makers him seem, so...well, normal! He says himself, this book was written to stimulate a dialog. I challenge The Merciless Critics to take him up on it and WRITE A BETTER ONE. I liked being told what I might expect in the future concerning the information highway because the evolution is taking place NOW as we approach the turn of the century."
3,Gates's View on Virtual Reality,"Bill Gates certainly understands Information Technology pretty well from a business point of view. But as for fascinating things such as virtual reality in the frontier of IT, he has a lot to learn from other visionaries. The book I am currently reading is, in my opinion, the bible of 21st-century technology. It leads us to see, with strict logical analysis and convincing argument, how virtual reality combined with teleoperation will change the whole foundation of our civilization. If Gates wants to be steps ahead of the rest of the IT industry, he'd better read this book or even invite this author to his mansion. The book I am talking about is titled: ""Get Real, A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality,"" by Philip Zhai."
3,This is not a biography.,"As Bill Gates mentions in the foreword, readers looking for an autobiography on him in the book will be disappointed. Road Ahead is very much primarily an easy-to-read IT textbook, except it doesn't deliver in a dry approach as textbooks do. The majority of the book deals with IT in general and is peppered with IT terms such as applications, enabling, reengineering, software, microprocessors, architecture, etc, in addition to dealing with critical issues and his own beliefs in the Information Age. Gates seemed to have written with an IT-illiterate audience in mind with the main objective of educating just such an audience, with only little insights into himself and his family."
4,Excellent vision of the future and how it may affect us.,"For those who can free themselves from the ""Microsoft Bashing Syndrome"", this book will prove to be a fascinating history of the past, present, and possible (or probable) future of the Internet. Not all of Gate's visions may come true concerning the directions it is likely to take and it's effect on our society; but it certainly gives the reader a springboard for their own thoughts. Written in easy-to-understand language by one of the major influences in the direction computers have taken us thus far"
4,Very well written for both the beginner and hacker.,"The time Gates spent on this updated version may havecost him plenty but was well worth it.An overview of what lays ahead from a man with realinnervision.The included CD contains all of the text as well aselectronic footnotes, videos and more. A great value."
4,Excellent vision on what the future holds for all of us.,Good reading to really understand what is currently happening withthe Internet and what the future holds for us. It is enlightningto get the view point of Bill Gates because of his excellentknowledge of all aspects of the computer industry. He iscertaintly in a better position than most to expound on thefuture of the Internet.Well worth the time for people who are into the Internet andwhere it might take us.
2,Interesting experience.,"If you want to read a boast about oneself - this is it. The book is Bill Gates patting Bill Gates on the back. It makes some curious and interesting forecasts but underneath it all, its a BOAST."
1,Review of Bill Gates book,I read The Road Ahead by Bill Gates and I think it is the most poorly written and thought out book I have ever read. Gates shows no support for his ideas. Terrible. I don't recommend this book.
1,As poor as the products he gives us....,"OK, where does he mentions network centric computing? Where does he talk about open standards? Bill Gates ego gets bigger as his wallet asfools rush out to buy his products without getting to know other products. If you want to read more about the future of computing, read about Java's WORA promise (don't know what WORA is, that's your signal to read more) and how Netscape turned the Internet into a household word. Gates theories are outdated and only reflect his desire to get into every business; and control it...."
1,Terrible!!!,Good ol' Billy Gates said nothing new is his book.The book was like a long advertisement giving reasons why you and I should continue to buy Microsoft's updated & unfinished products.The book itself sounded unfinished and now I am waiting for version 1 beta 2!
3,A farcical fiction,"Though Gates casts himself as a visionary in the world of high technology, his ghostwriters pretend that he has a far-reaching vision into the future. In fact this book has been through two editions. The first edition (written just a year earlier) makes almost no mention of the impact of the internet on the world. Only after the net reared its head did the writers of this novel revise it to include a ""vision"" of what the internet could be. A good fiction, but Gates the visionary who knows the road ahead? Not quite. Microsoft just wants to own the paving companies."
3,Consider its timeline,"Readers must keep in mind where technology was when this book was written. Many of the ideas discussed in the book have either come to fruition or will very soon!What is most interesting is the insight into Mr. Gate's thinking and the drive behind it. This more than anything has expanded computing into everyday life, from sophisticated applications to such mundane things as grocery shopping...An interesting read."
1,Waste of trees!,Bill Gates pats himself on the back once again in this book. It sounds to me like he did very little of the writing in this book. The writing style does not match the style that is found in Bill's other books. In one sentence...Complete Microsoft advertisement!Save your money!
3,"Accurate predictions, but....","Considering that this book was written in 1995, the predictions he made are quite remarkable in their prophecy. It would have been even more impressive if he had forewarned us that his software would control all of the desktop PCs in the world, and therefore his company would forever be producing overpriced cr-p that doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and there wouldn't be a da-n thing that anybody could do about it, because he's got all the money. And besides producing cr-p, all of his 'software engineers' would be overpaid egomaniacs who would not be capable of providing any useful technical support over the phone, so they would implement one of those totally useless and frustrating automated answering systems that would keep you on the phone for over an hour, and finally provide no useful information. That would have been some useful information. But other than that, I was truly impressed with his thoughts on the superhighway. Nice job."
3,Classic Gates-- Before the Internet was Invented....,Seriously this is Bill Gates talking about the future but out of 300 pages about 9 are dedicated to talking about the internet -- and most of that is buried with other information. Lots of talk about applications and appliances that did not materialize....one book you need to read because-- then you know that all the gurus DO NOT KNOW everythng !! Wonderful for entrepreneurs who dont' doubt their own paths on their road ahead......
2,The cover is the best part...,"All right, maybe I'm misjudging it. The CD is entertaining. This isn't a revolutionary tome written by a techno-visionary inventor, it's more a nice little pamphlet introducing people to Our Friend, Mr. Computer. Having read it 4 years ago, I found it just as vapid as Donald Trump's Art of the Deal: you find the same self-congratulation packaged as wisdom, but since Trump never claimed to be doing anything new, it's even worse. You get a techno-primer on such things as the binary system, a cute picture of a boy Gates fooling with a PDP-8, a lot of talk about his way-kewl house, and a CD-ROM showing off what life is going to be like in a Windows-centric future. Rereading it, it's amazing how much this ""visionary"" got wrong: stick to bridge, Bill, you're better off."
3,This 1996 book is starting to get a little dated,"Bill Gates and other Microsoft thinkers discuss the history and future of Microsoft and the PC. This book provides a good summary of the state of play and thinking at the time of publication. Much of the thinking is not particularly new or original, but coming from inside Microsoft it carries some weight. If you do not follow the industry, then this will provide a good overview -- although you might get the impression that Bill came up with all the ideas! The accompanying CD contains a version of the book's text and a view of Bill's famous high-tech home. The CD is really pretty unremarkable though."
4,A window to the future,"Great ideas from powerful people and thinkers like bill gates, the very people who are changing the economics and operations of businesses.What we can expect from IT in the future and how it is going to shape our lives and that of our posterity"
5,General technology planning guide for the next decade,"Planning to be around for another decade? Wonder where all the advances in communication technology are leading? Bill Gates offers a view of the next decade with enough substance to help the reader understand why life long learning will be expected and needed, why multicultural understanding will be expected and needed, why assurance of equity in access will be expected and needed, why wide bandwidth will be expected and needed and how individuals, households, schools and organizations will be expected and needed to evolve directly with the advances"
5,A book to whet your appetite for learning about technology.,"Bill Gates, the ""nerd"" who struck it big, describes technology of the past, present and future. For someone like me, who knew little about computers except word processing and e-mail, the book opened my eyes to the potential use of future technology. From information appliances to credit card wallets, I was amazed at the types of technology I have to look forward to. I teach business classes and have worked from the book in great detail. In addition, the CD Rom which accompanies the book is wonderful. One can ""read"" the book online and take hyperlinks to further definitions, or see videos of the people Bill talks about, people like Paul Allen and himself. One can even visit Bill Gates' home as it is being built. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants it all in a nutshell, learning about the technology while not being able to put the book down"
5,What is in the future and why we think it is.,"A very good book that helps you understand what is expected forthe future and WHY it is expected to happen. It also gives you a goodknowledge of the history of computer technology. It explanes how technology has affected, and will affect our lives. ^M --- The companion CD Rom is great. It has some awsome video of how our lives are projected to be in the future; as well as info about Bill's new techno-house (a prototype of how homes in the future may be) and the full text from the book. --- I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes computers and technology and wants to know what they'll want to watch out for in the future of the technology and the internet as it come closer and closer to being the true Information Super Highway."
1,Only If You Like Brain Dumps...,"This book is nothing but a brain dump. Do you like reading about wild ideas nonstop for a few hours? If so, you'll love it. Get your favorite beverage that will keep you up for a few hours and let Bill bombard you with ideas freeform.Are you looking for vision and a peek into the exciting future of the internet? If so, look elsewhere. You won't find it here.If you would like to know a little history of how the Internet came to be, the book ""Where Wizards Stay Up Late"" is terrific.Instead of investing more money in books that claim to give an overview of ""the road ahead"", I think I'll just dream of it myself and marvel at what others are accomplishing."
3,Personal insight to the growth of the cyber-man.,"But the cdrom doesn't work. Bootstrp causes a fatal error. The technical assistance number on the cd's instruction is no longer in service. But, call MS and after a 12 min wait you'll get another tech assist number which is also not in service. MS or Gates needs to get out an advisory to all. --Jerry Varela"
1,what a visionary!,"Here is a man so visionary he missed the entire point of the internet, and had to go back months later for a rewrite. Brilliant! He gives us such sage wisdom as ""the next big advance in computers will be a method of quickly factoring prime numbers."" Think about it. A prime means the only factors are 1 and the number itself. You need a fast way to get that?!?More great Bill wisdom:""I believe OS/2 is destined to be the most important operating system of all time."" -Bill Gates""If you can't make it good, at least make it look good."" -Bill Gates, 1994 (that explains XP then)""The Internet will never be more than a toy for hackers and gamers."" -1993 ""The internet is central to everything we do."" -1996Yeah sign up for his daily dose of wisdom..........lets not even cover the sad state of his companies stolen sowtware."
5,Interesting look back at what was supposed to be ahead.,"This is a great book to read and then ponder the question how could so much potential be held back by governmental red tape, policy and general fear? Look at the economic situation now and the failures of the dot coms and it's not hard to see why so many of them are failing! It's great to have vision, but that without execution is wasted. Most like Gates believe in what they can do, if we would only let them do it so the rest of us could benefit instead of trying to figure out how to keep them in check financially."
1,The Road in Bill's Head,"Bill Gates has accumulated the wealth that he has through being the most successful software pirate in the history of computers. From this reading it is obvious that he hasn't the slightest clue of how any of his products operate. He is the supremely luck 'Mr. Magoo' of the computer and business world, stumbling along into his riches.His accounts of where we came from leave out the glaring details of his 'black-ops'-like business style of bait and switch, the underhanded dealings with corporate America and the outright lies he has pushed upon the public time in and time out.His 'vision' of the future is one of near-perfect optimism, and in this I feel that he is correct. This is the direction that business, the world, the internet and the face of communications is heading. And no matter what he does -- pro or con -- it will happen."
2,Only for real fans of Bill. For MS advertisement lovers,"Although Bill Gates attempts to make a book of vision and technology, he falls into a commercialand egocentric approach.It seems that Mr Gates tries to make the ""newbies"" think that he and his company are the one and only computer technology providers (mind wash). He don't mention his real plans that include monopolic practices.What else could you expect from the owner of Microsoft?Only advertisement!.Jay Leno's Show was not enough.If you are looing for a real book about Microsoft, Technology, and vision this is the worst option.A must have for Bill's Fans only"
1,RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED.,"Self-serving. Boring. Wrong. He's not even looking aheadon the cover -- he's looking back to the days of over-priced,constantly-crashing, Wintellian PC monopolies, not forwardto the days of universal communications, content, andcomputing (i.e. network-centric computing)."
4,The road ahead and beyond in the field of computing...,The future is limitless; Bill Gates documents his visions in this excellent book. The Road Ahead offers answers to our fears and expands the imagination in the field of artificial intelligence.
2,YOU WILL WORSHIP MICROSOFT,"That is the only message within this book. It only enlightens you as to what microsoft has to offer as opposed to what there is out there. It refuses to acknowledge that microsoft will not be everything to everyone. Endorses Windows 95, stupid advertising"
3,Gates in the Road,"Having read this book when it was first published I decided to revisit it given the recent happenings with the Dept of Justice. The accuracy of Mr. Gate's predictions strike me in retrospect including (a) The role of computer (b) The role and cost of the Internet in our lives (c) Hardware predictions -- Smaller, lighter, adaptable.While some of Mr. Gate's predictions have yet to come to fruition (wallet PCs, digital intelligence which ""follows/tracks"" the individual), the ability to think outside the box is unbelievable. There were times however when Mr. Gates apparent arrogance does show through."
5,Piano Perfection!,"Saw it on TV and thought the music was beautiful, but forgot to write the information down... but managed to buy it online (now I see it frequently at the music stores)and I absolutely love this album -- all my favorite pieces! (I'm not big on writing comments or reviews, but was compelled by the artistry and passion I heard throughout this CD!)"
2,Not the best recording,"The songs were played flawlessly, however, it's really quiet. When you turn up the volume, you will hear hissing in the background."
4,This Is a refreshingly awesome movie!,"God Help Me is an awesome movie. You need to watch this DVD if you want to experience a very refreshing time of laughter and learning. Why is this a refreshing movie? Simple! There isn't any foul language, sex scenes, or violence. In addition to the lack of immorality, the movie contained a great comedy/satire plot. God Help Me will keep you laughing as it teaches a very important lesson in life. I highly recommend it to everyone, well, everyone who has a sense of humor!"
5,Required and Redeemed,"I had to read this novel for a college English class, and I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it very much because I didn't, for the most part, experience the angst and alienation that Holden experiences. However, I was a teen, and I did recognize that people lied all the time, about things big and little, and that politics lied, also, mouthing platitudes about our all being free and equal -- in the days when African-Americans were not permitted to ride the same busses or drink from the same fountains or sit in the same waiting rooms as whites. So, despite my initial skepticism, I began to feel great empathy with Holden, who wanted adults to be responsible and honest. I think the reason this book appeals to so many, even today, nearly 60 years after it was written, is that it addresses what teens feel about hypocrisy and lies."
5,Catcher Again,"I read this in prep school over 50 years ago. I identified with Holden as I was the same age when I was reading about his view of the world. Tried to read it again about 20 years ago, and could not plow through it...I am going to try again soon...yet I still rate it most highly as being a book that has never left my memories.W. Stewart Tittle"
3,"Good, but overrated","This book is generally considered a classic, and I can understand why. The plot elements are great, but the main character/narrator is not. Holden Caulfield is one of the least sympathetic characters in literary history. His voice is hard to read because it is so annoying. It is hard to imagine any real person speak or think like that, regardless of the time period. For most people, this book is very ""Love it or hate it""; I think it is a must read for that reason. Everyone should make up their own mind about it."
2,Want to read a knock off?,"if u want to read a huge knock off of ""The Catcher In The Rye"", then read ""King Dork"" by Frank Portman. Its really funny if you have read this book."
1,Wretched,"Absolutely positively the worst book I have ever read. It took me well over three months to get through this because I had to keep putting it down after reading a few pages at a time. I get that the main character is unbalanced, but his story was just so bizarre - much ado about nothing. I certainly do not understand why this is a classic. Just horrid."
3,Setting But Not Character,"It would be unfair to expect this book to react to Peter Jackson's film ""Heavenly Creatures,"" inasmuch as it was written before the film was made. As a companion piece to the film, however, it fleshes out the New Zealand of the 1950's and gives the murder a societal context. Unfortunately I found it difficult to be engaged by the book's distance from its subjects; Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme seem rather remote from the author's concerns, and the focus falls rather on the case's impact on contemporary and later lesbian politics and individuals. While I have no particular quarrel with the authors' politics, the title would suggest a closer examination of the girls themselves. In particular I question the authors' decision not to attempt to contact the grown-up Parker and Hulme for some comment. All in all, although this book places the events in context, it fails to illuminate the girls themselves."
3,Parker & Hulme,"In 1954, two New Zealand girls, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, killed Pauline's murder. This book explores the social and economic status of the girls, the Christchurch society and the overall conditions of the time period. It explores why children or women murder and discusses the anti-lesbian hysteria surrounding the trial. I picked up this book in order to read more about the case. Overall, the book contained few details about the girls life. It was more of a social commentary about the time period than about the girls themselves. Overall, I was a bit disappointed, not because of the writing style, but because I wanted to know more about the girls backgrounds, interactions and the murder itself."
2,Meh,"This is one of two books I found on the Parker-Hulme case. It approaches the story from a strictly lesbian point of view, which is interesting and somewhat valid; however, I think the writer misinterprets homoeroticism as strongly based love. I never did make it to the end of this book, mainly because I had to mentally edit the text for hyperbole. Once you've found the Parker-Hulme case you'll want to look for anything remotely associated with it, and there isn't much to find. Read this with a grain of salt."
2,More photographs would have been better.,"I believe the book was written in 1991, perhaps it could be looked at again seeing as so much new information has come to light ie/Juliet Hulme as Anne Perry, like a second edition with additions. Not bad as a whole, but more photographs of those involved like the Reipers and the Hulmes would have made it a bit more exciting. I give a two and a half stars really."
3,An earlier version,"The Evil Friendship (1954) was the first book about this case, written by VIN PACKER. It will be reissued by Stark Press in 2006. This book came many years after, but it is a fair read, just as Heavenly Creatures was okay. Marijane Meaker"
5,Lesbian Focus aside,"This is to my knowledge the only book out there exclusively about the Parker/Hulme case.Its a little shocking that another book hasn't been written about such a well known murder case, and in light of the fact that Juliet Hulme is now known to be Anne Perry,the famous mystery writer.I do agree that the lesbian angle was focused on a bit too much, even though that is a big part of the book.But it gives a lot of info about the case I hadn't heard before and a pretty clear picture of what happened.If anybody wants to know more about the story behind ""Heavenly Creatures"", read this book."
1,what?,"After reading and studying this particular case, I find it almost offensive that ANYONE would write a book about this infamous crime and focus on lesbianism. Yes lesbianism was considered a disease and those who engaged in it were considered insane. Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (Anne Perry) were NOT lesbians!! So why focus on that when this story is NOT about lesbianism. Get OVER your lesbian persecutions. If I could give this book no stars, I would."
1,Parker and Hulme,I think everyone who's seen Peter Jackson's move Heavenly Creatures ( 1994) and wish to learn more about the 1954 case should get this book. There are some basic information of events such as the trial and so on. As for the research and work you'd probably will be disappointed. I think the book should be updated too since there are a couple of errors.
1,quiescent,"Ugh. Waste of time, waste of money, waste of press. This book was drawn out to three days. I didn't think I was going to get through it. Throughout the whole book the authors are habitually telling you how ""inaccurate"" 'Heavenly Creatures' was without backing any of that up. This book is poorly written, and I learned miniscule amounts from what I already knew from the film and web sites. I felt like I was dragging a 50 ton anchor with each word, forcing myself on the next page. I was near dead by the end. The one point they managed to get across is that not every lesbian has a psychopathic disorder waiting to be cooped up in a ward. Weird, I always thought myself they were stark-craving mad. Thanks guys. I suggest the true crime (gender-bending) book 'All She Wanted' well over this."
2,CD-ROM doesn't work if you have a MAC,"Well, the book really is helpful though the main reason I bought this was for everything that is on the CD. SO this has proven to be useless to me. They need to be more specific about compatibility, it is a 2005 product."

2,"Great science fiction, horrible transition to KINDLE","Very poor transition from print to eBook. Multiple character recognition mistakes. Publisher's software handles italics badly and their proofreaders either can't read or don't care. For those of you familiar with the work, 'rilla comes through as Villa, fem as fern.Very annoying.Since I had similar experiences with SUNDIVER, STARTIDE RISING, and BRIGHTNESS REEF, I make the assumption that this is a publisher issue, not an AMAZON issue.I wish there was a method for sending proofreading mistakes back to the publisher directly."
5,2nd Best Hard SF book ever written :-),Second only to StarTide Rising. Read that book first tounderstand why all the aliens are so jumpy. That get will get you hooked...
4,Thought-provoking,"I read the Uplift Trilogy in a mixed-up order. I started with Startide Rising (2), then went to Uplift War (3), then finished with Sundiver (1). It's not a big deal to read them out of order, although I would read them in order had I known. In any case, this is a good one. The trilogy's imaginative concept of species ""uplifting"" one another is a fascinating one that is front and center in this book. Quite a lot of Galactic civilization is discussed, satisfying a thirst from Startide. I did deduct a star due to its length, however.Read this one last. You'll love it if you like the universe Brin has created."
