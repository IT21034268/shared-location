5,Works perfectly with slot loading MacBook Pro,"I was having trouble reading some DVD's, and looked into ways of fixing it. This laser cleaner came up a lot, and I decided to give it a try. When I received it, I was scared to use it with the slow loading drive in my MacBook Pro because it is literally a CD with 5 or 6 little brushed on the bottom, and I feared it would get stuck in the slot loading drive. Inserted the disk, it made some crazy noises for about a minute, popped the disk out, and the drive reads the previously unreadable disks PERFECTLY now. I recommend this product 100% to anyone with a slot loading drive on a Mac that is having trouble."
1,Rip-Off,Get an air jet. It will do more. This waste of time and money would be better spent throwing candy to children
5,it works,"It worked on my Mac powerbook superdrive. Pretty easy. Not really sure what else to say, except that it works."
4,Brilliant!,My dvd player was so dirty it has stopped reading dvd's (although it continued to play music cd's). One clean with this product and I'm back on the couch watching movies!
3,CD/DVD Cleaner,This product arrived promptly and in excellent condition. My husband still uses a multiple-disc CD player in his office for background music of his preference. The Memorex lens cleaner worked perfectly to clean out dust and debris when the CD player was opened.
2,Nothing special,"As far as cleaning, I wasn't impressed and that's what I really bought this item for. The portion dedicated to proper set up of your sound system is pretty good. If you have a CD/ DVD player that doesn't get much use and you just want something to run through every now and then, this may work fine, for my truck's CD player, it's not cutting it."
1,Did not clean my DVD player,DVD player stopped reading disks. Tech support suggested cleaning lens. Tried Memorex but it could not read the disk either. Either DVD player is shot or cleaner does not work.
1,Piece of poop,"This was inexpensive, arrived quickly and did not work in any dvd/cd player I own. Beware if it seems too good to be true it is."
2,Didn't Work,"It did not correct the problem. DVDs skipped no matter how many times I cleaned, finally just bought a new DVD player"
1,defected item! do not buy..,"this product ruined my expensive onkyo 6 disc cd changer, i put the product in the changer and took it out when it was done, and my cd player failed to register any cds or hope them in the splindle which cam ajar, due to the cd cleaning process of this product. i bought this through amazon, they need to make ammends and replace my cd player.. me, my husband and children have been loyal customers and we love doing buisiness with amazon. i purchased this product for my husband for christmas."
1,it didn't work for me,I hoped this product would get my car CD player working again. I ran it through several times but the dang thing still won't work.
2,Works Part of the time,Tried this disk on 5 different CD/DVD drives and it only worked on three. Four drives were on computers and one drive was on a surround sound system. All drives work with CD and DVDs. Two of the drives could not find any files and subsequently would not proceed to clean the drives. I cannot recommend this product.
1,may have made things worse,"So my dad's dvd home theater system would take a long time to load the movies, it would just say ""reading"" and then it would try to play the disc (by going through each chapter and not playing) and then stop. On the few occasions it would play, the movie would start freezing and then skipping to later scenes. There were no smudges, scratches, etc to the discs which worked well in other devices so I knew it was the player. Going online almost everyone said that it was due to a dirty laser which could be cleaned by products such as this one. So I ordered it, played it, followed the instructions word for word, put in my disc and now it won't even recognize the disc. It doesn't even say ""reading"" anymore, nothing happens. So I'm pretty sure the disc actually made things worse and instead of wasting any more time or money on cheap garbage like this, I'm going to go buy a new A/V receiver and junk the Dvd player/receiver that this disc dealt a final blow to."
1,bought 2 from walmart...neither worked,"i was tired of paying so much for these cleaner products and just happened to be in walmart cruising the isles..when i saw these...and they were a product i normally trust...memorexnow, unless these two i bought at the same time were both lemons...don't waste your moneyneither of them worked ..nothingin fact when they finished loading..my dvd recorder told me to take them out..loli would have given them no stars...but you can't do that here"
1,Worthless!,"I have a Toshiba SD-1800 DVD player, and at first it was able to play the first and second track of the Memorex disk, but then it stopped functioning and my player won't read it anymore. I tried to select track 13, which is supposed to be the cleaning track, but it doesn't appear to have done anything, since my player still freezes intermittently whenever it plays disks."
2,Didn't work for what I bought it for,The device only worked in some of my CD drives...but not the one I bought it for which is the primary one we use for the kids DVDs. So still have a problem playing DVD's
2,Meh,"This Laser-Lens cleaner works fairly well, depending on your DVD player. It helped resolve some issues I was having with my speaker system set-up. However, I bought a new Toshiba HD-DVD player about a week after getting the cleaner, and it will not operate at all on the new equipment. Guess I'll try it on my computer DVD to see if it works. If not, I'm returning it."
4,better than replacing the DVD ROM drive,"I used this on a MacBook Pro, but it's pretty common on all slot-loading drives that they get clogged with dirt and when people take them in to be serviced, the company just replaces the whole drive at a huge cost. I've fixed 4 out of 5 of these ""broken"" drives by just cleaning them with a DVD lens cleaner like this. This one worked pretty well but I wish it didn't have all the on-screen junk, because it doesn't fully clean the lens without going through the steps, when one of the problems is that your lens can't read the DVD anyway. I wish it had more brushes that spun over the lens for longer. I usually have to use a bit of solvent on the brushes (even though they say you don't need it, you usually do), either lens cleaner, white board cleaner, or good old vinegar. I run it about 6-10 times and it does wonders. Then I use a vacuum to suck out the drive and then run the cleaner again just in case any more dust got on the lens."
5,Great buy for the money,"I was having skipping issues with my CD player and was contemplating replacing it with a new one. The CD player cleaner saved me alot of money by not having to do that. What a great investment. Not only did it clean the player and stop it from skipping, it was so simple to use. It also helps you to calibrate your speaker system as well. Everyone who owns a CD player should invest in one of these."
2,didn't work with dvd player,I purchased this laser cleaner as I have 5 cd/dvd recorders and do a cleaning about every month. It worked fine with all the players except the Panasonic recorder. It wouldn't recognize it so couldn't use it........what's up with that?
1,Defective,"Out of three DVD players this disc would not load, with various error messages for each dvd player. On cd player, disc would not eject requiring me to disassemble unit to remove dvd cleaner. So not good luck for me"
1,I was hoping this would clean my old DVD player; Not So Much.,"I looked on Amazon to see which DVD cleaner was the ""best"", and this one was rated highly. So I invested the $9 on this item and took it home. Easy enough to use, just open it and play it in your DVD player. Unfortunately, it didn't fix my problem. I was having disk read errors and lots of skipping while playing movies, and afterward I was able to load a disc it was having trouble reading, once, and then it would freeze again. Another disc that loaded to the menu and then froze immediately upon playing the movie, and after that it was consistently giving me a ""no disc"" message. Ultimately I have to give this product a big Thumbs-down."
5,Memorex CD/DVD Player Laser-Lens Cleaner - highly recommend!,"I was about to throw out this DVD/CD recorder/player as it had stopped playing many of my favorite old CDs. After using this product (which is pretty simple to do), the player now plays ALL the CDs that it had stopped playing (clearly because of a dirty lens). For some 8 bucks (cost of this product with free shipping), I saved myself from buying another DVD/CD recorder/player. Great value for the money and I would highly recommend it!"
1,Waste Of Money,My DVD Player stopped reading about half of my discs. So I bought this thing to try and fix that problem. But guess what? My DVD Player wouldn't read this disc either. So I sat there like an idiot for 30 minutes ejecting and inserting but no luck. And the best part of it all is my DVD Player is also a memorex. Obviously it's not worth returning it for only 6 dollars.
2,Did not work on half of my players,"I bought this because several of my DVD players were starting to take a noticeably longer time to load any DVD's which I inserted, and in the case of scratched up rentals struggled to play them in certain sections while my newer players could.I have a total of 7 DVD players in my home, counting those in my computers and gaming systems, and this product did not work in 4 of the 7! 4 of the 7 players just couldn't read the disc at all.Considering they all read every DVD, albeit slowly at times, I have to blame it on this product.I ordered a different brand, theDVD Dr. Optical Lens Cleanerand it worked perfectly on every single dvd player I own.My recommendation to anyone looking at this product is to pass and order a different brand. I rate this one 2 out of 5 stars; I'd reserve one start for one that didn't work at all on any of my players."
4,Good Laser Lens Cleaner for the price,This is a very good cleaner for this price. It offers a very easy and simple to follow format. The DVD has a narrator that walks you through the cleaning process and tells what it doing as well. It also has a feature to assist with setting up your surround sound system.
1,Doesn't do a d*mn thing,My Panasonic DVD Player/Recorder does not recognize this as a valid DVD and won't let it spin for more than a second. None of the 'features' will work. I'm taking it back.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Never worked. Have tried on several computers, and none will recognize it as a CD. Buy another brand, don't waste your time or money."
2,Didn't work in DVD player - unreadable disk,"I trust Memorex, so I bought this to use in my DVD player, which is a pretty expensive Panasonic model. I put the disk in but the DVD player couldn't read it. I got ""unreadable"" disk errors. Just to test it, I put it in my CD player. The CD player could read the disc. I let it run through one test, but it gave me some pretty lousy results - the program incorrectly identified which speakers were front, center, rear--indicating that I had my system mis-configured, which I did not. I put the disk back in the DVD player to try again. Still unreadable.I returned it and am looking for a better quality DVD lens cleaner."
2,Roll the Dice,I tried this product on two DVD players. It seemed like it was working from the audio portion of the program. I was unable to get the associated video portion to work on screen. It was unable to clean the DVD players for them to work.
3,getting my CD player to work,The item I purchased after being told this would cure the problem did not solve my problem. In other situations it might have worked just fine but my difficulty was different.
4,Exactly as advertised,"My 5-disc CD player was having problems with skipping and repeating on tracks for a variety of discs, especially when in ""Shuffle"" mode. In troubleshooting the problem, the first step in diagnosing and fixing this problem (other than ensuring the problem doesn't lie with the discs themselves) is to clean the laser lens with a disc cleaning kit. I purchased this cleaning disc, and in one pass, it cleared up the problem. I'm happy that the skipping and repeating problem wasn't more serious (there are a number reasons for this problem), and this disc did exactly what it was designed to do. Highly recommended."
4,Will buy this again when it wears out,"Will buy this again when it wears out. In tiny tiny print it says it is ""good for approximately 30 uses.""It ""fixed"" the ROM in my computer, so I am very happy!NOTE: The computer does not recognize this disc, but the tiny brushes on the disc seem to have dusted off the optical reader anyway."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"This disk does not clean DVD players, only CD players or possibly a home unit combo CD/DVD drive (not a computer drive). The package clearly states ""Laser lens Cleaner for CD and DVD Players"". Insult to injury: the seller, SAA Investment di not make good on my complaint - first time I've been burned on an Amazon purchase."
3,Not sure it helped,"Did not really notice a differance after using this products, so what is the point?"
1,It didn't work for me,This product wouldn't read in my DVD player so I dropped it in the waste basket. It wasn't worth the effort to return it.
2,Doesn't work in my DVD player,"The instructions say to put it in your player and press play. When I put it in my player, the player spins and spins for a while and then says the disc is not readable. Maybe just by spinning it did some cleaning (I can't tell), but whatever other functionality it is supposed to have, it doesn't have."
2,Disapointing performance overall..,"I tried this memorex DVD, LENS CLEANER ON BOTH MY DVD PLAYER AND STEREO CD PLAYER... THERE WAS A SMALL IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOUND FROM MY CDS AND THERE WAS NO SKIPPING...I TRIED THE CLEANING PROCESS ON MY DVD PLAYER AND THE OUTCOME WAS WORSE, THAN THEN IT WAS, BEFORE I CLEANED IT.I HAD TO REPLACE THE PLAYER."
1,Poorly constructed wheels,I would expected better from Samsonite. I have had this model for only five months and the wheels are almost bald and on top of that they make a terrible noise. It sounds as if I put a piece of plastic in a bicycle tire's spokes while its spinning. I would suggest you get a bag with real inline skating wheels and trash the soft wheel bags.
2,Great bag - pathetic wheels,I strongly agree with Becca B on the wheels. The bag itself is indestructable but the wheels are pathetic. They seem to last about 6 months for me. I have had the wheels replaced by a Samsonite repair center three times at my expense - the last time I asked them to use harder rollerblade wheels. I'm not sure what they used but they didn't last any longer. That repair center is no longer available and not the closest one is over 350 miles away. The wheels on my garment bag are wearing like iron so i just don't get it. Do not buy this bag if you plan to roll it much.
2,I Was Expecting Better from Samsonite,"First, the space allocated for the personal travel items is very small and not compartmentalised. There are no zippered pouches to hold toiletries or small items. Second, the quality and the workmanship is pretty bad inside the bag. This buyer is dissapointed."
3,"A GOOD MYSTERY,",I'M AN AVID CHRISTIE FAN AND I COULD NOT WAIT TO DEVOUR THIS BOOK. WHAT GOT ME WAS THE TITLE AND AS I READ ON THE BOOK DID NOT DISAPPOINT UNTIL CLOSE THE END WHEN THE KILLER WAS EXPOSED.IN THE USUAL STYLE OF AGATHA CHRISTIE IT WAS A TOTAL SUPRISE! IF YOU LIKE A GOOD MYSTERY WITH LOTS OF SUSPECT THEN YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK
3,I've read better,"Well, it was a good book (just as I find most Agatha Christie novels), but I've read many of her books and it didn't even compare with, say, ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."" That title, in my opinion, is a work of genius, and this one I didn't find one of the more exciting ones. But it's worth your time nonetheless, and the solution is clever."
3,AVERAGE POIROT MYSTERY,"AFTER THE FUNERAL was written in 1952 and first published in 1953. This Hercule Poirot ""all in the family"" mystery is, in my opinion, not one of the best Agatha Christie mysteries of that period but I appreciated it anyway for its implacable portrayal of a British family of the high bourgeoisie. Incidentally, if the members of the Abernethy family hadn't been so self-conscious of their belonging to their social class, there wouldn't have been any mystery at all. The solution of the mystery is, one must admit it, very improbable and strictly lies on the fact that people of a peculiar social class completely ignore those from a different background."
4,"Twisting and turning, you can't resist trying to solve it","The revelations from chapter to chapter will take your mind twisting and turning down many possible paths. While After the Funeral is not in the class of Murder on the Orient Express or Death on the Nile, it is a captivating effort none the less. Recommended."
1,Junk,"I've had this a few weeks now. CD play function stopped after a few days. Radio volume, even when set to max, is barely audible. Changing batteries didn't help. A waste of money."
3,poorly made - did not last long,"I was initially very happy with this cd player for my teen daughter to play her cd's wherever she wanted in the apartment. However, it did not last long. It was treated well, but the cd player broke within a year, and other buttons stopped working as well. It was not heavily used either (she has an ipod). It was cheaply made. This is disgusting. I hate the thought of tossing it in the landfill."
1,Only if you want a disposable one,"It's cute, but crappy. Even when it worked, the interface was confusing and it had no volume. With good care and limited use, it lasted less than two years. It died on me yesterday - the buttons stopped working entirely. I recommend that this model be avoided."
1,Don't buy this--it's garbage,Buying this was a waste of money. It won't play any tapes or CD's that have been copied or burned even though it is advertised to do so. It hangs up when you play tapes (has eaten two new tapes already) and also hangs up when playing cd's. I haven't tried the radio but I am definitely throwing this junk in the garbage. It is not worth the time and effort (and postage) to return it.
2,Picks up a lot of static!,Getting a lot of static interference if I leave it on the CD setting for too long. The problem can be solved by grounding the metal connectors on the volume dial (need to open it up). This shouldn't happen with a company like Emerson. Piece of Chinese junk!
1,Malfunctioned cd player,Cd player didnt work. Havent received return label yet and the last day to return item is the 20th. Sent emails company said they sent one but i havent receivef it and i emailed them several timedNo reply to my email.
1,A Real Shame,There are no words to express how much this product sucks. It sucks so bad! There really are no other words. Don't do it!!
2,"No cord, No sound.","The product review doesn't mention that my player would come absent a cord to plug it into the wall. A space for a jack exists without precise info as to which jack to buy. Otherwise pre-order batteries, which I did not do."
1,Garbage CD Player,"I bought this item intentionally as a ""cheap"" CD player for my daughter's toddler music. Well this is an instance where you truly get what you pay for. I don't recommend this product, unless you are looking for a disposable CD player. After 4 months I finally have to throw it away. I currently have drink coasters holding the lid down. Mind you, the two year old never touches it. All the internal plastic bits are falling off left and right... This really is garbage and I'm alarmed and how poor the quality is. I wasn't expecting trash, but that's what this is. Spend a few more dollars and perhaps you can spare yourself this disaster!"
3,Worked well for me,I bought this for my toddler to play music on. One the plus side the sound quality was pretty good for the price. One the negative side the battery life was terrible: 6-12 hours on rechargable C-cells (since it was a toddler toy I didn't wan't to use the AC cord).I used it for about two months with no problems but later replaced it with a different model with poor sound quality but better battery life. I think someone looking for a bedside CD player would be happy with this.
3,"Basic Player, Good Price","For the price, it is fantastic! If you are looking for a basic player, this is it! Works great, easy to use."
3,She needs to work on her spiritual angst,"Ok, done with Taltos. The woman (Rice) is crazy. She needs to do some serious work with this spiritual conflict of hers. She sounds like a pagan at heart and fighting it with all the illogic of Catholicism. Of course, Catholicism is all pagan, anyway, but she is making herself insane trying to find a common ground, which isn't going to happen. The final half of this book was so whiny and soul-screaming with it all, I skipped through most of it."
3,Light of Day,"Taltos is a more-than-decent conclusion to the Mayfair Witches cycle. After the dark, depressing Lasher, this novel lightens things up considerably, and provides a sunny sort of ending to the series. It is not her best work, but a more cohesive and interesting plot resides in Taltos than anything else Rice has done lately. In this novel she seems to reconcile a lot of the dark associations her writings has with femininity... she's gone from Rowan's murder of her own daughter in ""Lasher"" to Mona and her own daughter Morgan, in a loving, warm relationship, where the child does not die again. It's a wonderfully realized work of imagination and one of her best books."
5,This book is awesome,"Its very detailed but its still awesome. Wish it came in hard cover but its ok. Overall, this book is awesome"
4,loves to read,"Altho this is the third book of the Mayfair Witches, the enjoyment of this book does not depend on having read the first two. Ann Rice has a knack of bringing a book to its conclusion completely but leaves the possibility of more to come. In this book a whole new set of witches are revieled and manage to create their own set of problems."
4,Good summer reading,"I enjoy reading this series every so often while on vacation. The imagery helps me to relax and unwind. The plot and characters are enough to keep me engaged without over-taxing my brain too much. A good series to read on a long flight, or a quiet beach."
2,Not her best effort,"I agree with another reviewer on this list that Rice should have stopped while she was ahead. She told a wonderful and gripping story in the Witching Hour. This installment paled in comparison. I usually love Rice's rich detail and the epic scope of her stories, but here it just dragged. If you like Anne Rice, you probably will not hate this book, but there is little here to love."
3,Poor end to the saga,"Although very interesting as any of Anne Rice's books, I think Taltos ends the Mayfair saga without the glamour of the other two previous books, specially ""The Witching Hour"". I just didn't like the idea of turning a very interesting and mysterious character as Lasher into one of many of this strange race. An I also missed some ""Mayfair History"" along the way."
4,Taltos by Anne Rice,"Taltos concludes the Mayfair witches trilogy and ties up a lot of loose ends about the family, history and what's to come. The Taltos, thought to be bad get a complete explanation in this book. Anne Rice spins quite a long story incorporating many of the characters you've already met by telling the history of the Taltos and their ways as well as sorrows.I fitting conclusion to this trilogy with a rather abrupt ending. All in all, a good read with a weak ending."
3,Taltos,I was expecting this book to be as good as the first two. It hasn't measured up so far for me.
2,disappointing,"The Mayfair Witches is one of the best scary books written. Lasher was a great follow-up. Taltos was a big disappointment. I began reading the books back in the early 90's, found out I was expecting, and quit reading. Old Southern folklore--don't see or read gore! This is too ingrained in me not to believe! Anyway, now I have plenty of time to read and wanted to finish the series. Somewhere along the line I think Taltos lost the stream and the action wasn't as immediate and did not link back to the immediate family. That being stated, would love to do the series as an intensive book study focusing on genealogy and the significant part it plays in our characteristics."
3,Anne Rice Taltos,I really enjoy the writings of Anne Rice but unfortunately after following up on the last edition to the Mayfair Witches Taltos.. it really didn't intrigue me as much as the first two.She started to lag with the character Ash who was revealing his past life. Overall she took the essence of what she created as the Taltos to be a bit ehh when it come to this story. Ash account of his life was a bit all over the place for me and it lacked the depth that Lasher had. I guess what I imagine it to be didn't necessarily fall through.. maybe the Taltos vary differently one from another. Towards the end it seemed she was just trying to hurry and finish just jumbling situations in it.But it is a good read and definitely leaves you wondering.
4,Very fine book by Ms. Rice,"I still think it's impossible to top ""The Witching Hour,"" which was one of the most complete books of Anne Rice's long career; everything in it worked, from the characters to the storytelling to the setting. But ""Taltos"" did surprise me with its freshness and its narrative drive. Not my favorite of Anne's works, but definitely a great read."
1,This book should never have been written.,"Ms. Rice tantalized and mystified us with probably the best work since the first two ""Vampire"" books when she wrote ""The Witching Hour"". Following, ""Lasher"" could have, and should have, been the conclusion. Nothing more need be said about Rowan, Michael, and the Mayfair family. The climax had been reached and passed. We were entertained by horror and mystery well in keeping with Rice's best. But, for some reason, the author felt compelled to write an encore where none was needed. What was mystery turned to absurdity; what was enticing and teasing became tedious and dull. Ms. Rice needs to know when to leave well enough alone and move on"
5,Taltos,This Anne Rice series on the Mayfair Witches was awesome. At first I wasn't going to read the last book but OMG I'm so glad I did. It really brought it all together.
2,At least I didn't have to buy it,"Unlike other books by Ms. Rice, I found Taltos to be tedious, ponderous, dull, and in need of editing for both content and context, not to mention grammar. Come on, I stayed up late to finish a book that fell completely flat.Ridiculous, rushed ending. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Not one of Rice's best,"I love Anne Rice. She writes in great detail and creates rich, beautiful characters with the Mayfair Witches as well as the Vampire Chronicles. This book is not one of her best to say the least. I'm not that sure it's even an ending the Witches series because the ending leaves you in the air. There was less excitement with this book. I suppose that is due to the fact that the treachery in the Talamasca is resolved very early in the book, leaving little to become excited about in the remaining chapters in the book. I feel that she tried to do too much in this book, resolving past issues from the Witches series and going into more detail on the Taltos species. All in all, it wasn't a bad book because Anne Rice is such a superb writer and it is entertaining to read but in comparison to The Witching Hour and Lasher, this book falls short."
3,hmmmmm......,"I was a little put off by some things in the book to truly enjoy it. Namely, a thirteen year old's pregnancy. Not too ""tasteful"" imo. That Taltos breast milk fetish is ridiculous to whine about since we are talking about a different species here and to put my own standards on that is silly. But come on, a pregnant thirteen year old? Now of course Anne Rice can sure write and her novels are characteriscally sensual and uninhibited. If you don't like the idea that of a same sex relationship(take a pick), eunuchs(a Cry to Heaven), or spanking(the Claiming of Sleeping Beauty)Anne Rice isn't for you. But seriously, a pregnant thirteen year old?!"
4,Decent end to the Mayfair trilogy,"While Witching Hour remains the best in this trilogy, Taltos was thankfully better than Lasher. While some things felt a bit implausible to me (how could a Taltos grow so quickly after being born when it has no food/vitamins/etc to nourish its growing flesh - a scientific impossibility when you consider just how quickly they grow - within the hour after birth!), this was a very good book and answered questions about the Taltos and where they came from. Mona was an interesting character, she is a far better character in this novel than she was in the atrocity that is 'Blood Canticle'. The ending surprised me, but it was a fun one. Overall a solid and decent Anne Rice book."
4,good,"This book although a little late in coming, was in very good condition. Would buy from this seller again."
3,Wrap-up,"This book was sort of a let down after reading the previous two. I felt that it was a bit anticlimactic when compared with the other books in the story arc. However, I felt that the book did an decent job of wrapping up the story, so for the most part, I enjoyed it."
4,Well Um...,"Being an Anne Rice fan after reading this book I have to say I was a little dissapointed. I was really expecting something a little more...not what it was. The first two, ""The Witching Hour,"" and ""Lasher"" were definetlly something good. But I dont quite know what happened here. It seemed to drag on forever then the ending was a shocker, but hey what do you expect from a witch. It wasn't that bad, it was quite interestring, especially what happened to Mona. I would read it but just don't get your hopes up, and don't rush through the book expecting some wild ending, it'll be what you expect from the Mayfairs."
1,"Normally I love Anne Rice, but...","Rice was definitely at her worst while writing this novel. I usually find her descriptions rich with her abundance of details, but here, I found it just plain boring, tedious and excrutiating to read. I felt as if she wrote this novel because she had to, not because she wanted to. Don't bother to read this book unless you like to be tortured."
1,Can't believe I wasted my time!!!,"I enjoyed the first book of this series and praised it to all my friends. I liked _Lasher_ as well, but _Taltos_ is just plain bad. It is way too long and the dialog is inane sometimes. Only Anne Rice would write a paragraph to describe a color. Sometimes scenes were halting and seemed to be thrown in just to set up another, bigger scene. And the ""I love you, but I hate you"" idea was already old by page 100. I found I didn't care for the characters as I did in the other books. They were just *talked about*, not really explored as before. After reading 3/4 of it, I gave up, threw the book on the night stand and started reading _The Meaning of Quantum Theory_, by Jim Baggott. I found it much more interesting *and* exciting."
2,Ehhhh....,"I fell in love with ""The Witching Hour"" - the first book of the trilogy. ""Lasher"" was fast-paced and afterwards left me highly anticipating ""Taltos."" However, with this novel being the conclusion to the previous two, I was disappointed. Rice's focus of the novel is not on the Mayfair Family. By the last 50 pages or so...I kept thinking...""how is she going to end this?"" I was left with that terrible feeling that nothing was going to be explained properly and this story was not going to end as I had anticipated. As another reviewer has mentioned below, the ending is very rushed - this is very true. If you have enjoyed ""The Witching Hour"" and ""Lasher"" you will of course want to read this book...but be prepared to be disappointed."
1,"If you must read this book, try the library! Save your $$$!","I absolutely loved, loved, loved ""The Witching Hour"" and could not wait for more! Ha. Then I read ""Lasher"", and thought okay, every author has a bad novel now and then, so I was eager to see if ""Taltos"" would improve the series. NO, NO,NO. Just when you think things couldn't get worse... I dearly hope the next book finds that Ash and Morrigan rampantly have bred and overpopulated the earth. An interesting concept(family of gifted humans) turned ludicrous!!! I would prefer it if Anne would take the time to write a sequel to ""The Mummy""-one of her best books ever!"
5,excellent!!!! anne rice is brilliant!,I have read the witch chronicles completely and am on taltos for the 2nd time. Anne Rice is brilliant! Her one-of-a kind way of giving descriptions of things is very unique and exciting. It's like you are actually there secretly watching.
2,Rice shouldn't have written this one,"Its a pitty... a story written by Anne Rice with a happy end ????? Not only that, but I saw it already coming when I had only read 50% of the book. What I also want to say is that I think it is a pitty that the mystery of Lasher, the gost, is broken down to the mystery of a biological being in the book 'Lasher', and that with this book she also demystifies the specie itself : the Taltos. Anyhow, I'm happy that I've read the book (just to have read the whole serie of the Mayfair Witches), but on its own, the book certainly can't reach the level of the other two books"
3,not what I expected,"Is it me or does did the book seem to end on a very anti-climatic note? I've read Anne Rice's the witching hour, and Lasher. But when I finished reading Taltos I was disappointed in how the story ended and I was also disappointed with the three young female characters. There constant whining destroyed any hope for me to have any interest with them at all. I found myself skimming over their sections in the book to find out more about the history of the taltos and the trip that Rowan and Michael were taking in London. Over all the book turned out okay. But I wish the ending didn't seem to just flop out all of a sudden."
4,Thrilling and suspenseful!!!,"One of Rice's best books. Most of it held me in complete suspense, and it thrilled me to the bone!"
3,It's just aching for a sequel...,"I found _Taltos_ to be incredibly mediocre. The first two books in the Mayfair series were very detailed and proved a lot of insight into the family, Lasher, etc. This book seemed mostly worthles to me, and very predictable. While I enjoyed reading it because of Mona, Rowan, Michael, etc, I didn't enjoy the direction this book went. ""Mr. Ash"" was a lovable character, but not lovable enough to dedicate a whole book to. Mona's struggles were almost completely overlooked and seemed secondary. It also seemed like the ending of the book was written to make a very easy entry into a sequel ( just as _The Witching Hour_ was ). I'd buy the sequel, but if it had too much Taltos in it, I'd never get to the end."
4,dead confusing if you haven't read the first 2 books,"I think it would have helped to read the first two books, before attempting this (although it was a present). It took me a very long time to absorb the characters--she introduces too many, I think. It was a long time beofre things actually started to make sense, and I could see that it was a good book and that Ann Rice lives up to her reputation, but it requires concentration to read her books (something which I did not know)!! Not a bad read."
4,a little slow but excellent nevertheless,"I've read all three Mayfair books in a row and Taltos was my least favorite, though it was still a great book. The only problem was there was not as much Mayfair history as in the other ones, no Julien, no Stella, no Marybeth. I've come to fall in love with all of these characters. And like most of Anne Rice's books, the ending leaves you wanting for a sequel, but I believe the reader must decide for himself what happens here."
5,Suspenseful!,"Ive enjoyed The Witching Hour, and Lasher as well as every other of Anne Rices novels...theres nothing really bad to say about this book...it was everything i thought it would be!!"
4,Marriage of Reggae and Electronic,"Pretty good CD all together. A little more on the Reggae side than I expected but I liked the Noiseshaper cuts on some of the Late Night compliations so I thought I'd give it a try. There are some very good cuts here and the more I listen to it, the more I like it on the whole. But, it's ot a disc where every track is a masterpiece and you should be a fan of Reggae in general before parting with your cash of this disc wjust won't appeal to you."
2,Do we really need to know all this period detail?,"I found this a tough book to finish and did not enjoy it. The wealth of presumably accurate period detail is certainly impressive and adds some verismo. However it is really only wallpaper and did not paper over the very significant dramatic cracks in the work. Events are in very short supply. We have inklings of adultery, incest and lesbianism but there is little true development of these themes beyond introduction and elaboration. One yearns for confrontations, conflicts and resolutions but there is only the cloudy malaise of pre-war England. Mrs Howard is clearly fascinated by the world of children and we have endless descriptions of their emotions and play. Actually the depiction of childish thought process is very well done. But at the end of the book little has happened other than the birth of a child."
4,Settle in for a while--you won't put this one down!,"I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the rest of the series. The characters are well done and true-to-life--there aren't really villains and heroes--each person has his ups and downs. There were times when I felt the pace of the book was a little slow, but I bought the other three anyway just to see what was happening with the family. The book reminded me of Jan Karon's Mitford series, and I hope the rest of the series is as good!"
1,RETRO FANS UNITE!,"Midway has officially changed the title lineup on this collection, show your anger and write them a bad review!!!!THEY REMOVED STUN RUNNER, STEEL TALONS, and the original MORTAL COMBAT....Once again, the only way to play STUN RUNNER at home LEGALLY, NO MAME, is to buy an Arcade JAMMA, or the only console version, which is pretty good, ATARI LYNX..."
4,Enjoy Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 !!!,"I've bought this game, because I'm a Mortal Kombat-fan. Midway Arcade Treasures 2 has Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 and I enjoy these games. Other games are not interesting I only play Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 on MAT2. Also the graphics are very good. And both MK-games run very quickly. Buy it !!! Only in Mortal Kombat 2: If you want to know Kitana's ""kiss of death""-fatality; press and hold LK (low kick) then type forward twice, down, forward and release LK."
2,"If you want this for Mortal Kombat II or III, think again.","If you want this title for Mortal Kombat II or MKIII, think again. Upon receiving this game, I was immensely excited with my anticipation of being reunited with the classic Mortal Kombat II. The game looks great. The controls are there. But the one huge turn-off is that this game is so unplayable in 1-player mode. The CPU opponent is so ridiculously cheap and difficult that you are lucky if you can even get passed the 3rd fighter. I used to beat the old arcade and SNES versions of MKII, but cannot barely pass the 3rd or 4th opponent.If you want to play against other people then the game is great. But if you plan on just enjoying the game for yourself and want to play the CPU? Good luck. Because you will need a ton of it."
4,This is The Best Compilation Arcade game ever!!!!,"This game has pretty good graphics and a good amount of games and variety on one disc. I like, Total Carnage, MK 2,3, Gauntlet 2, Cyberball 2072, Pit Fighter, Arch Rivals, Xybots, Championship Sprint, Primal Rage and Rampage World Tour. But games like Wacko, Hard Drivin, Xenophobe, Kozmik Kroozer, APB and Spy Hunter 2 arent worth your time. This game also includes interviews about the games on here which I think are cool and interesting. I would Pay 20$ for this game. If your seeking more compilation games, see my reviews on the following games, Midway arcade Treasures 1 and 3, Atari Anthology, Intellivision Lives, Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2, and Taito Legends 1. Also coming soon is... Namco Museum 50th anniversary, Taito Legends 2, Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 and Sega Classics Collection and/or Sega Genesis Collection."
5,good,I recommend the supplier and the product coincides with the bid. Not damaged and specifications are correct. Appropriate and reliable
5,Damn Good Dudes!!!,"This CD is awesome!!! I listened to it a few times to really get the feel!! Boy did I start to feel it!It takes me back to the 70's when I was that dancing,laughing,happy little giddy girl ;)P.S. Justin Strauss is very, very YUMMY!"
3,Undecided,"We used this product on our four outdoor/indoor cats; they hated getting sprayed so it was a two-person job, and not one I'd like to attempt again for awhile. Plus, I'm not really sold on how well it is touted to work; it seems like my cats stopped scratching right at first but then within two weeks they were beginning again. This could be from the flea life cycle, but I'm not sure. Nothing really solid on getting rid of the problem with this product, so I won't be buying it again. I was so hopeful as it was natural and smelled good. I will keep looking."
2,Not a good purchase,"This does not seem to work on my short haired dog. The spray nozzle also frequently ""sticks"" and I have to pry the lever bar out of the squirt nozzle with my fingernail. Very frustrating!"
2,Not so effective,My girls are still laying and digging in my flower bed as soon as the next day after I've sprayed.
2,Did not enjoy this book at all,"I did not read the first book in this series and after reading this one i don't plan to. It was told in first person by someone Other then the characters described on the back of the book. There was very little in this book actually about Mary and Cloud Walker. It was mostly about Hannah and Shadow. I do not like books writen in the first person and this just shows why. The book goes back and forth between Hannah and Shadow, Hawk and Valarie, and Mary and Cloud Walker. This story had potential. and this is the only book by Madeline Baker that I do not like."
4,Way t o go Kim!!,"How good it is to see one of Third Street's own makin' in the ""Biz"" without having to compromise her integrity or personality!! Way to go Kim!! To those of you who are thinking about buying this album, do so!! It'll keep ya hummin' and boppin' for a long, long time! Great music from one of Newfoundland's great artists!"
5,"A practical, user-friendly guide for parents, student, and t","If you are a parent, then you know (or you will soon learn) the agony that accompanies standardized tests, and worse, the day the results arrive home. Firstly, the scores themselves are not easy to understand, and what is worse is when you child wants you to explain them to him or her!I found this book to be a saving grace for me and my family. It is a practical guide for preparing, understanding and explaining the tests and the scores. I highly recommend it to any parent who has a child facing standardized tests."
4,Have to have those!,"Call me stupid, because I tried them on in purple when I was in Boston last month, but didn't buy them... And now they're nowhere to be found in a size 9.5 or 10 anymore, I'm SO sad!"
4,Not at all bad.,"If you enjoy Star Trek books, you'll probably enjoy this one. It did a better-than-fair job of portraying the established characters, puts them in a situation that is novel and moderately interesting, and has them interact with a fairly interesting and well-thought-out alien culture. And if I could have done without Data being an annoying twit, that's pretty much par for the course; he was no worse here than he was in many of the TV episodes, especially the early ones. Still, somehow despite all of the positives that I have to say about it, it just didn't grab me enough to rate a five-star review; on a purely subjective basis, I drop it a star. Still, it was a pretty fair read.Of course, if you don't like Star Trek stories in particular or genre fiction in general, you won't want to read this. But you already knew that before I weighed in with my opinion."
2,Don't bother!,"It's not often I have to force myself to finish a book. But that was the case with ""Tooth and Claw"". I found it to be a weak story, the characters uninteresting and/or annoying, and plain and simply totally boring. This is the first time I have tried this author, and I won't be in a hurry to try her again if this book is anything to go by. If you want to read a new trek adventure try something else. No adventure to be found here."
2,The Apocalypse,im so upset about that dvd of that movie provide no cc i dont know what is all about it is not fair for any deaf people to see this movie without cc what if it is important info that we should know beside i didnt see any point in that movie so far i watch it but missing info what it says ... it suxs!!!
1,Unwatchable.,"I thought his movie might be an enjoyable B movie, but it was completely unwatchable because they hired an incompetent to do the sound mixing, so half the time you can't hear the dialogue. Don't waste your money."
3,Book therapy,"Sometimes I Like to Fight, but I Don't Do It Much Anymore: A Self-Esteem Book for Children With Difficulty in Controlling Their Anger (Our Sometimes Series)This is a good book, however it has more to it than my 4 year old needed. I was looking for a book about handling anger. We are dealing with impulsive anger and ""I want to have things my way"" anger. This book is dealing more with family issues and councillors at school. It seemed to imply there were psychological issues but didn't specify. It seemed more like dealing with violence instead of anger. Still it is a well written book and something to think about."
3,teerex,"No room for error when throwing this disc. Im a pretty good player, and the only consistency when I throw this disc is the inconsistency. I think this disc would prove very good in the hands of an ADVANCED player, but not someone like me who thinks he is better than he actually is. Take my advice on this."
1,Don't buy this one!,"If you like Moe Bandy's hits you don't want to buy this one. It is remakes of his hits & he doesn't have the voice he once did. Moe shouldn't have even rerecorded these songs with his failing voice - it is a slap in the faces of his fans! What a waste of money! It was so bad that we threw it away! I wouldn't even give it 1 star, but 0 stars was not an option."
1,Don't bother,"I read the first two chapters and put the book down. Now it's filed away in the ""do not bother to read"" pile of books I will give away for free. The story is blah and it doesn't make you want to read more."
3,Lighthearted Read,"This is a casual time-travel romance with a lot of jokes centered around the fact that the cute (and cuddly?) hero is actually a 10th century Viking warrior brought to the 20th century on the back of a killer whale. (Yes, it is a bit ridiculous.) I think I'm out of my element in reviewing this novel, since it's more informal and jokey than I prefer my romances. (It wasn't steamy or intense by a long shot.) I'm rating it a 3/5 even though I put it down halfway through because Sandra Hill deserves credit for creating such a playful hero with whom the other reviewers seem so enraptured."
5,Sandra Hill has done it yet AGAIN!,"Every time I pick up a Sandra Hill, I think it can't be better than the one she wrote previously and she outdoes her self every time. This book about 'Joe' and Maggie was everything I could every hope for in an entertaining book and more. Every one of Sandra Hill's books are on my keeper shelf! I eagerly look forward to her next book."
2,Disappointing,"The best cd is the first one. Didn't care for the 2nd disk at all. Third is okay, at best. With all the great goth and industrial songs out there, this disk was very disappointing & a waste of money."
5,"Absolutely Amazed, One of the best CD's of 05 period","This album is absolutely amazed. I liked VR before this CD came out but now I absolutely love them. The source material for the CD can be disturbing if you dont like horror and torture but how can you deny this cd? Amazing vocals, amazing guitar work, wicked vocal transforms (shiver, the great castration) and the breakdown at the end of the great castration just did it for me. Either way I cannot get this CD out of my head and I cant wait for the next release."
1,What Is The Matter With You People?,"Sure this band sounds good but in the world we live in now, who needs to here about murder,rape, and satanism? Everyday you hear about people getting murdered or someone got raped, and do you really think this music helps make things better? No it doesn't. The lyrics cover everything from violence, to devil worshipping, to telling people god isn't real, to having sex with dead people. This is disturbing. There are definently better bands out there that have way better, and more positive lyrics. I recommend Killswitch Engage. They have very good music, and they don't have to cuss and use explict lyrics to impress people. I'm sure people will hate this review....but that's just the world we live in."
3,Into the Cuisinart of ideas,"If you put Nabokov's ""Pale Fire"" into a blender with Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot stories and Mary Renault's historical novels set in ancient Athens, you'd probably get something like this. It is an engaging read, but not a great one. If you want a good, intellectually stimulating romp through the labyrinth of reality and illusion, I'd recommend you read ""Pale Fire."" If you like your reality-illusion puzzles with archaeology, read Arthur Phillips's ""The Egyptologist."""
4,just a shade too derivative,"I should warn you now - coninue reading this review and it might just spoil your reading of The Athenian Murders. And I don't want to do that, because this novel is a cracking read that kept me engrossed till the final page. Both Heracles and the Translator are finely-drawn protagonist's who offer an intriguing point of view on the unfolding narrative. However, around the halfway point I began to suspect I had seen all this before. And eventually I figured it out. As the movie buffs say, The Athenian Murders is The Secret History meets Sophie's World. Still, there is no such thing as a new story in this world. If neither of the previously referenced novels are familiar to you, you will greatly enjoy Somoza's classical whodunnit. If you are familiar with both those novels - why are you still reading when I warned you not to in the first sentence?"
5,Sandy Schreier Gives Us Another Fabulous Book!,"This book happened to be published at a time when several of my friends were getting married and it makes an excellent bridal shower gift for the friend who loves old movies. This book is similar in set up to Schreier's other great book ""Hollywood Dressed & Undressed"" in that there are photos of movies with a bit of text and director and costuming credits. It is a simple set up, but it lets you view the fabulous wedding scenes in films through the years, such as ""Haystacks and Steeples"" (1916) or ""Show People"" (1928) up to newer films like ""Where The Heart Is"" (2000) or ""Runaway Bride"" (1999). Scattered throughout are photos of real celebrity weddings such as that of Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg (1927) or Shirley Temple and John Agar (1945). Great book by this great fashion historian who owns the largest private collection of 20th century couture!"
5,This is not a wedding book-it's Hollywood and movie stars!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the stories and studying the pictures. Hollywood Gets Married focuses on a very important aspect of the movies and movie stars-weddings and all the trappings that go with getting married and unmarried. You can enjoy the beautiful pictures of brides, but all along you know that the real stories are what happens to the people, both as film characters and in real life.If you are a film buff, get this book. Its focus on Hollywood weddings is lively and informative. If you love movies, you will love the book."
3,It wasn't what I thought it was.,"I guess I didn't read the description carefully enough. This is a book of weddings from movies, NOT a book about the real weddings of movie stars!!"
5,It works and looks nice to boot.,"It works pretty well. The included filter lets finer grounds through, so you either have to use a rougher grind or paper filter. It's surprisingly light and easy to clean. I've cleaned it in a dishwasher about a dozen times already and it seems to be perfectly okay with that.It's faster, cheaper and cleaner than a coffee machine and the results are better too.The only complaint I have is that it's a little hard to pour from, at least when you've just woken up and haven't had your coffee yet."
2,Extremely Delicate,Its a beautiful product but the first time I put it in the dishwasher it shattered. There were no instructions to the contrary and I had written to the manufacturer asking if it was dishwasher safe but received no answer to my inquiry. Presently I am just using a typical insulated carafe and #4 paper filter and funnel to brew my coffee. It works fine but would be nice to be able to see how much water is filling the carafe instead of having to lift the funnel.
1,UPDATE -- Got one intact and love it,"I'd originally bought this from Amazon and it arrived broken. I did receive credit, as Amazon's customer service is terrific. Now for the review.....UPDATE: I bought this and was finally able to use it, because I didn't have it shipped. It is really nice to use, but I'm not thrilled about the look of the silicone around the neck of the beaker. It feels clinical. Being a scientific lab junkie, I really do love the shape of this and find that the insulation does work rather well. I also am happy with the glass funnel and reusable filter, so no paper filters are required. As will all of my Bodum coffee makers, I wash them immediately and have had no problems with staining or residue. Amazon seems to be packing things better now, so I'd give it a chance."
1,Shattered dreams.....,"I was really looking forward to trying this set up for making coffee. I have a Chemex which uses paper filters so I like the idea of the gold filter. I also think the idea of having the double wall construction is a great for keeping the coffee warm. Alas, I have to give it a one star because it arrived with the inside chamber completely shattered! But I give Amazon 5 stars for ease of returning the item and refunding the price. If the fragility cam be addressed then I see this as an ideal coffee setup."
2,Just a matter of time before it breaks,"I have to concur with the (Bodum stock holder?) review above, it is a cool looking pot which should impress your friends while it lasts. The real deal is that it is not a great performer when it comes to keeping your coffee warm for any length of time. As well, mine shattered while sitting on a (wood) table, 10 minutes after brewing a pot, with no real cause. Pop, shatter, that was it. It's your money. Good luck."
4,Guess I was one of the lucky ones ..,"not only did I get mine for $19.99 but I've had it for over a month with no problems at all - I love it. It makes an awesome ""pot"" of coffee and looks cool too. I prefer to use a relatively fine grind and while I can deal with the bit of sludge in the bottom of the cup, I'd prefer not. Just bought some #4 unbleached paper filters and problem solved - but make sure you put the paper filter inside the gold filter when you do it. My first attempt without the gold filter in place blew the paper filter right out the bottom into the carafe. The ""double"" filter also slows down the drip brew time a bit which is a good thing - more flavor."
4,"Elegant Design, Smooth Coffee...but FRAGILE!","Similar in design to the classic Chem-ex coffee maker, the Bistro by Bodum makes smooth, delicious coffee. The insulation works well and the rubber gripping ensures ease of use.I adored this coffee maker, but give it just 4 stars because a very slight bump while washing it caused the glass to crack."
1,Not Recommended,"I can't recommend this. As much as I love Bodum's designs, the glass carafe on this coffee maker shattered the first time I used it. I made a pot of coffee, poured myself a cup, turned away and heard a 'pop.' The thin glass at the bottom of the carafe had shattered - I can only assume because of temperature as there was no impact."
2,Would have been a nice item....,"I would like to review the item itself but after receiving 3 broken Bistro'sAmazon e-mailed me that ""the problem is more widespread than they thought""I am a big fan of Bodum and really wanted this coffee maker but not now that I know how fragile they are.Maybe Bodum will make a newer and thicker version later on. Then I will review the product.Looks and design an A+ Quality and durability well you know the rest.Kudo's to those of you that got one in one piece!"
1,shipping problem,"I never got to try this product because during shipping the flask was broken, twice.Bistro Double-Wall 30-Ounce Pour-Over Drip Coffee Maker with Gold Filter"
2,Fragile Funnel,"My Bodum arrived intact despite Amazon's woeful packing. Everything came through the dishwasher intact. I was able to brew 3 times until a slight tap shattered the funnel. The coffee I was able to brew was weak- indeed as one person has pointed out, the funnel does not hold the water in the grounds long enough to properly brew. So now, for $20, I have a nice decanter. I can use it to pour coffee from a french press pot and reduce the sediment a bit. If I'd paid more, this would be going right back to Amazon. Such a disappointment from an otherwise great company- Bodum.added Dec 2008: The decanter didn't last long either. At least is was deeply discounted at the time of purchase. The only lasting piece is the gold funnel. I would not recommend buying this item. I'd give it a no star review now."
2,maybe a good product,"I order it because it's charming outlook. But, I didn't get a chance to use it because its broken when it arrived."
1,Another pair of broken units,"Two more broken ones sent my way - first from my original order, second as the replacement. Carafe appears to be extremely fragile."
2,bistro bodum,"I purchased the bodum double walled drip coffee maker and used it for a couple weeks. I loved the look of it, the feel of it and it made great coffee but the outside wall cracked straight across the bottem for no apparent reason. It was set on a cold stove top and the protective bumper was in place. The vessel had been preheated with warm water, I poured the hot water into it and a minite or so later. . . the outside wall cracked. Very dissapointing. Now what do I do?"
4,Pleasant fast read - steamy romance,This book has a very nice flow -- it is a quick read -- very nice characters. The only negative -- I felt that the man (Austin) was a bit too victimized near the end. He insisted on the marriage and then spent a good portion of the rest of the book trying to talk himself out of it... Well the ending was very happy....
4,good blade,I used this in my circular saw to cut expensive veneered plywood. Very little tear out even when cross cutting. This blade if slightly thinner than other thin kerf blades. Recommended
1,Not as great as advertised.,"This is a so-so cleaner.As for repairing scratched CDs or DVDs, don't waste your money.I tried it on 5 different disks with varying levels of scratches.This thing didn't repair any of them."
1,Worthless,"This thing is completely worthless. Tried it on a few discs, and it didn't make a bit of difference. The cleaning also didn't do anything, I still had to clean by hand after running it through the cleaning cycle. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have!"
3,Regular,"El equipo es bueno, sin embargo las felpas de limpieza se caen de los circulos donde estan pegadas.."
1,Find another way !,"Can only rate this as one star...This unit leaves small semi circle scrathes on my dvd's and cd's.I am trying to experiment with it cause there is not much out there. But looks like it will go back to where it came from.I have owned a discwasher cdstealth cleaner for years. Nobody sells replacement pads for it, otherwise I would still be using it... Even though it was a pain to operate.The Memorex unit would be the ultimate system. However there is no sense speaking of its ease of use if it damages your collection. SHAME on Memorex."
1,Ineffective repair,"The manual CD repair products do a far better job than this one. In fact, I couldn't see that it did anything at all. It does a fair job with mere cleaning, but who needs to spend this kind of money to clean discs when you can clean them for free with water and a soft cloth?"
1,It's a scratch kit,"When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before. The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home. After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods. In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair! What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable. I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize and steer clear of this particular Memorex product."
1,Does not repair scratches!,"Did nothing to repair my nonworking disc! No less scratches, no nothing! In fact, it seemed to made it worse..."
1,Worst CD doctor product I've used yet,"After getting tired of having to Hold the other CD Doctor type products out there, I decided to try this one as you can put the CD in and wait. Well I brought it home and opened the box, and low and behold the repair solution bottle was already open. Went back out and bought another bottle and tried this out. After it was done ""repairing"" the disc, I pulled it out and looked at it, and saw absolutely no difference in hwo the CD looked before I put it in. With the other skip doctor, you can see that it's made a difference. Figured thats how it worked and tried it out. It changed nothing in my CD. Same skips at the same places. Tried it a few more times with other scratched up CDs, and nothing. I felt scammed on this one, as it didn't do a thing to my cds. I will go back to the other CD doctors, as I never had an issue with them. I suggest you stay away from this one, unless you have money to blow and want to try something different."
1,Not worth its weight in sand,"I bought this product for $20. Tried to repair a couple of CD's with it, but this device created more circular scratches on the disc.Please dont ever buy this item."
1,Junk. Avoid this. It does not work.,Unable to repair the simplest scratch for repair. Bad cleaning job. Repaired nothing. Avoid this.
2,cd/dvd scracther,It kind of worked just not enough speed .Did not even touch med grade defect and left behind smaller one.Did do a ok job on cleaning off finger prints.You further ahead finding a commercial cleaner for your cleaning needs..Or better yet a ounce of prevention sure beats the cure.
3,Use Optifix along with Digital Innovations,"First , I put the disk through the Digital Innovations repair tool, then put it through the Optifix. The DI resurfaced the disk but left scuff marks of it's own (no ill effect to the disk) so I put it through the Optifix and buffed it up real nice.......the disks look and work as good as ever. I also make my own fluid with 50/50 steril water and 90% Isopropyl Alcohol. Extends the time of use on any disk. It doesn't do a good enough job on it's own to rate anything higher than a 3, and that's only cause it does do a decent buff job."
4,Cleans Great; DVD Repairs Need more,"I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are. However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks. [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.] I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it. If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away.My main complaint is that I can't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid. I hate to have to pay $7-$8 for stuff I don't need.[My collection is now at over 1800 different DVDs, so I have some experience with cleaning them.]"
5,it works if used correctly,"I bought the memorex cd/dvd cleaner- after I bought it I saw some bad reviews. If you use it like it says -I worked great. My 5 yr old daughter ruined 3 dvd, One the Wizard of Oz. I used the fixer and then the cleaner (household medical alchol also cleans well)as discribed. I fixed,then cleaned the DVDS. then repeated the steps one more time. Clean the DVDs and there will be no film residue. DVD were as good as new"
1,Lame,"I got this as a gift. I already had a hand-cranked scratch remover that works great! Except you have to turn it forever, and I was happy to get a motorized one.I put a minorly scratched CD in the machine. It's noisy. And after a while of noise that annoyed everyone around me, I took the disc out....and it was exactly like how I put it in there. It didn't do anything.The repair wheels and the cleaning wheels seem to be made of the same fabric, which is barely abrasive. They're just different colors is all.For cleaning, it might do a different job, but why get a machine to do it when you can use a t-shirt like everyone else does?"
1,I WILL BE RETURNING THIS TO WALMART,"We Bought This Yesterday to repair a gamecube disk, that keeps stopping in the middle of the game with a disc error read, there are alot of scratches but we thought this would help-Wrong. I ran it through the repair process about 6 times, testing the game after each try, also tried the cleaning process. Well the end result is that is does not work. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this item,( I actually went to purchase another brand, but this was all the store had),We were desperate, so we tried. We will be returing this item today-I will try another brand,hopefully I get the game fixed ,it is cheaper than buying a new game, Now if I can only find the right repair kit."
1,be warned about lead,"I was really excited to get this product. I unpacked everything and noticed a label on the cord. Imagine my surprise when it said: ""This product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""There was no warning on the box, and customer service did not seem to be concerned that their products contain lead!!! There must be something else out there that can be used. I have a three year old who puts his hands on everything, I am returning this immediately."
1,dont buy not worth a cent,got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it -100 good thing i could return it.
1,No like...,"There was found to put the comments, but I became more familiar with the product and now take the opportunity to comment, very weak, did not work as I expected, I did not like."
1,NOT AS GOOD,"This product came with broken pieces, havent used it yet, don't know if i should. i might make my disks worst. over all i guess u get what u pay for."
3,So what now?,"So far, I have attempted to repair and clean four discs and this product is not working as described. It's easy to use, but I am waiting to see the results show!"
1,Not a SONY,"Do not be tricked! Even though the image and description is of a true SONY VAIO battery - an offbrand one arrives. The Brilliant Store ( not really very Brilliant!) blames the ""mistake"" on Amazon. The seller was clearly aware of their own deceptive practice and did not care."
3,"Works fine, but it it's not Sony.","The product works fine in my notebook (Sony Vaio PGL-V505DX) but as the other customer said, the battery it is not a Sony original, so I suggest that the BrilliantStore changes the picture and the announcement."
2,Read by the whole of class 2.2 (St.Albans School),"The Guardians J ChristopherIt's 2053, and Britain has been split into two different areas (the conurb and the county.) The conurb is a hectic urban area, full of bright lights and `lumoglobes.' There is a great demand for blood sports and the streets are full of rioting conurbans. The county on the other hand is a peaceful country area. Everything is made in `Victorian style,' and people (instead of driving around in modern electrocars,) ride horses and `take afternoon tea with the rest of the gentry.' The main character is Rob Randall, a young orphaned boy. Rob decides to cross over to the county and the trouble carries on from there. I didn't really enjoy this book because it wasn't very fast moving. I myself prefer more action packed but for a less action orientated this would be a good book to read. I myself did not enjoy the book and would have to give it a, poor.... 4/10 Sorry John Christopher!!!!!!!!"
2,read more about this book!,"THE GUARDIANSThe good points of this book are that the contents are generally good however in the beginning it starts rather slowly. This is a novel of debate; it has very little action and will not suit all readers. Where the novel falls down is that it has nothing to please anyone who wants action, This is a specialised book for debate. It would have been better if the author had put more into the book than he did because it seems to stop short of a full book in several areas namely fast paced action."
1,Am I on dope or what??,"This is presented in dialogue style with an introduction by theauthor. Both were a waste of time, at least for me, so thatif you intended to transmit some sort of knowledge or learningit certainly was not done by this book.Just from looking at it, I was sure it would have some pieceof meat that would make my life easier, but alas, I becamebogged down trying to determine what was being said, was it true,or was someone pulling my leg. If this is the source of thestory of Atlantis, I sure would not be looking for that placebased upon this writing.I did not like it, mainly because it did not transmit anytype of knowledge or learning for me. Maybe I'm stupid, but then...well.....maybe."
3,moon cake mold,"Purchased the product for mom to make moon cake, the mold was a little spendy, but thought would give it a try. Discovered there are other molds to make the cake which would be easier to remove from the pan, and the shapes turns out better. We used mini-cake mold shaped like roses, it is a mold with 6-8 cakes in a pan. Worked out really well."
5,Silent Braking,"Finally OE quality pads for an aftermarket price. Once past the initial break-in of the new pads/rotors, these pads have provided a very firm pedal feel and are the first totally silent aftermarket pads I have ever found. They're worth every penny and then some."
5,Awesome!,This is a must have for WWII or Vietnam fans! The multiplayer is very fun. The single-player is OK. I would greatly recommend this game to anyone who likes war games.
4,a good collection,"these games are somewhat time sensitive. I bought them in 11/06, and while you can still find enough people playing, the numbers are going down. BF2 is out as well as bf 2142. All the games have a single player mode, but it is really just a way to learn to play. You really want to play against 15-30 other people to enjoy the games. There are also some large free mod's for bf1942 which can extend the usefullness of the game. I recommend getting a joystick (I use a saitek evo) for use with planes and helicopters. You can fly without one but it helps.If you are thinking of buying this and more time has passed, you might try to use gamespy or xfire or some online tracker to see how many servers and players are still playing. As of 1/07 I would still recommend it. FYI: this is more of a serious shooter game and will require some effort to learn. I would not pick it as your first game."
3,Ok but nothing special,"I went through a phase where I played WW2 games quite a bit. I loved the Medal of Honor series, and Call of Duty was decent but not great. So I decided to try out Battlefield, and I saw this collection at the store. There was a lot to install, so it took a while to get it all onto my computer. I actually enjoyed playing it for awhile. I did, however, become rather bored in a short period of time. The AI is not the greatest, and whenever I died my character had to run FOREVER to get back to the battle. I became bored mostly because of this. After running around fighting, then dying, then running back again, I felt like my character was getting a good workout but not really accomplishing very much.If you have a lot of time and patience, this game is decent. Otherwise, I would pass on it and play something a little less frustrating."
3,"Nice game for slower computers, poor multiplayer experience","This is an old game, as you probably know. This bundle is just the CDs from the original releases packed into one box; installation very tedious and awkward. I wasn't able to install BF Vietnam, I get some weird error, but did not mind it because I was never interested in it.The multiplayer servers don't have much people, and will get more desolated every day."
1,Don't waste your time,"I bought this, not thinking and hoping it would be similar to the Battlefield 2 compilation. Not even close! The Battlefield 2 collection is so much more advanced, the graphics are 1000 times better, and the movement and attention to detail is also incredibly better than the 1942. Besides, I like playing online and I couldn't find anyone, ANYONE playing Battlefield 1942. There are thousands of people playing Battlefield 2. Do yourself a favor and look past the Battlefield 1942. It may have been top of the line at one point, but now, it just sucks."
1,Battlefield 1942,"The graphics and action may be very good, but it is the customer support behind the product that is most important! EA Games seems not to want to work with customers regarding simple problems.. such as inverting the mouse action. The game is totally unplayable unless there is a way to invert the mouse function. The default status is totally against logic for forward equals up, and backward equals down. All other game programs have the option to invert the mouse. Or, it can be added to the configuration file.It would be near impossible to operate a plane or construction equipment in such a manner with a joystick or shuttle control. Obviously, the EA Games programmers have no sense of reality."
1,BAD interface. No fun. Bad games,Don't buy it. It failed to pass me on to the next level even though I had beaten the level. The interface is badly designed and the game is not really fun.
4,Great Value,"Great value for all these games. Games are fun to play, this series really pioneered the whole co-op multiplayer online war games thing."
4,Great,"First of all, you cannot get a better deal for this amount of warfare. The graphics are very good with fun missions and good challenges. A good thing to know that I did not was that there are only campaign modes on Battlefield 1942 and Vietnam. The two other games only have missions. They did not mention this in the instructions. I sent a series of emails to EA before they told me this. Besides that these games were a lot of fun and provided hours of entertainment. This game also works on Windows Vista. Have fun."
5,Gets my blood pumping!,"One of the best games back in the day! I get soo hooked on it when I start fighting, my blood starts pumping and the adrenaline rush is awesome. I get shot and the only thing I think of is getting back in and killing the guy who shot me! I use this as a stress reducer at the end of the day.One of the best games for any pc gamer, the online play exceptionally well. Well worth the buy! Have FUN!"
4,"Good Shipping, Alright Game",The Shipping was timely. Arriving on the day it was predicted. The game its self is a fine game. The campaign is lacking but the multi player online is wonderful. There are updates available and modes to change up the game. Updates are necessary to play online.
3,Awesome deal,"This has all of Battlefield 1942's expansions, patches, etc - as well as Battlefield Vietnam! It even has the map editors and server applications. You WILL have to get the latest patch from the official game websites or you will NOT be able to play on a lot of online servers, as you will get an ""incompatible version"" type error when you try to connect. Surprisingly, there are still a fair amount of people playing this game online, which is what always made this game franchise so great - playing against real people instead of robots. For the price, this pack cannot be beat. I bought it, though I had 1942 and all of it's expansions, just to have the disks in one easy place, and Battlefield Vietnam. This game will also play on ""outdated"" computers, as the requirements are pretty low. See you on the battlefield!"
4,Great Bundle,"Battlefield is the granddaddy of World War Two shooter games. This phat set bundles all three and the less interesting Battlefield Vietnam. Played this game for a year and it never got boring. I have only two complaints. First off, it's silly to force the player to constantly adjust the pitch and yaw of an aircraft--it's a shooter game, not a flight simulator! Second, the bundled sets (Road to Rome and Secret Weapons) should have had a campaign structure instead of merely instant battle status. How hard is it to save your game results?Over all a fine bundle, grousing aside!"
5,Battlefield is great!,"This is a great game for PC. The regular 1942 game is great in itself. The expansion packs are pretty fun too. Battlefield Vietnam is basically the same, but with different weapons, vehicles, characters and terrain. The game is more realistic than most because you never make it through a whole mission as just one person. The only bad thing about the game is when you get stuck without a vehicle on a large map. The graphics are pretty good, but not the best."
4,Great Game,Like the fact it has all the games in it. Hours of fun. Great purchase and the price was something I could afford.
3,Single player,"Not enough single player sections which is only what I'm interested in, but at $9.99 will give a few hours of interest. Glad I did't buy it at full price."
3,red dog,"The book is alright. It give a good list of fats and carbohydrate calories, but it has a limited appendix, and not enough information. It is a very dry read."
4,The Sky-liners: Sackett,"I happend to like Louis Lamour in general. He wrote in an era that can be a bit dated for attitudes (some of his female characters are a bit 2-dimensional), but he had a good turn of phrase and usually a good plot moving forward quickly. I have especially enjoyed his work on CD Audio, although David Straitharn is the best reader of the lot who record Lamour. (This book is done by Jason Culp, who is not bad at all). This is a short novel and not necessarily one of his best, but still fun. Most of the Sackett novels are centered around Tell and his family; this one picks up on two of his cousins."
4,The Skyliners,"I'm just starting to read Westerns, and this was my first read of L'Amour. I found it to be quite entertaining. Humorous in parts, serious in others, L'Amour is a good storyteller, and I'll definitely try some of his other books."
4,Great coverage.,"Nice product, but the control top is very restrictive and uncomfortable. Would be great in a non-control top style."
2,Surprisingly unsophisticated,"Somehow Nick Leeson ended up with the reputation as some kind of whiz kid but reading this book you get a different sense. The derivatives Mr. Leeson was trading do not seem particularly sophisticated (don't compare this to LTCM). But you wouldn't learn much about them from this book. I got the sense that Mr. Leeson was grappling with very basic financial questions. As a consequence, the book tends to be repetitive in a description of losses getting out of control and the soap opera building around that. You also have a nagging feeling that you never get the full story. However, the book is interesting where it describes the complete breakdown of financial and management controls."
4,It could happen to anyone but like the lottery it never does,"Nick is a young normal intelligent guy that gets caught up in a web of deciept that he created. One should not feel sorry for him, for as this book explains he had the starring role in this play. His insights into what it like to be the star in a real life play that has a Shakespearean ending is interesting reading."
4,A real life thriller,"A great summer read. I (and probably most other readers) would have benefitted from a somewhat clearer and simpler explanation of the complicated financial transactions, however."
5,"Losing control, and losing money","A lot of people lose control of something in their lives but eventually they cut their loses and walk away. Nick Leeson on the other hand loses control and keeps trying to fix the problem by virtually doubling down, until things spiral completely out of control. It is an interesting account how this man lost control over the 88888 account and brought down one of the world's oldest banks while upper management had no idea what was going on underneath them."
1,Don't read this one unless you also read a companion account,"A shallow story by a shallow deceiver: this book by itself isn't worth the time. I intentionally read this back-to-back with ""The Collapse of Barings"" by Stephen Fay (but one of the other available accounts would have done as well). Neither author recounts the actual account manipulations by Leeson nor the Japanese market situation leading into this time frame. So at least a third book is needed to round out the picture, such as _The Bubble Economy_ by C. Wood (1992). The message seems to be that we are awash in globalized Big Money and globalized Big Crooks! It's 10 p.m. Do you know where you savings and investments are?"
5,Better Than A Backstage Pass,"This book is better than a backstage pass and an open bar. Wood has been hanging out with country stars since Willie Nelson had short hair and visible signs of ambition. While lesser reporters asked their questions, got their stories and went home, Wood stayed on to ride the buses, drink the whiskey and share the hangovers. Wonder of wonders, he kept notes on everything! Neither a muckraker nor an apologist, Wood views his subjects like an unobtrusive documentary maker. But he displays a wicked sense of humor, a virtue he sorely needed when he found himself trapped on Conway Twitty's grim and rule-bound bus. My favorite story, though, is the one in which he, Jimmy Buffett and Jerry Jeff Walker get drunk in New Orleans and ill-advisedly hop a train to Nashville. From then on, it's Hee Haw meets Animal House. Virtually every country star who's emerged during the past 35 years finds a place in these thoroughly absorbing pages."
1,Weakly written by star struck guy,"Sadly, this book disappoints on many levels. It is poorly written, even sounds like blather into a tape recorder otherwise unedited. Too, the writer clearly wishes to attach himself to as many stars and to live off their fame. There is a name for that which starts with star f...... The offhand exposition of ""look who I know"" gets tiresome fast. Also, ""look who I am photographed with."" Sad little book."
2,Interesting but dated in many ways,"This edition has some interesting aspects of model rocketry for the hobbyist who is ready for some new ideas and directions. Unfortunately many of the chapters retained from the first edition are now seriously dated. The photographs are also dated and in at least one case, in the wrong chapter. Most notably missing are any websites for sources, organizations and companies which would expand on a hobbyists knowlege of these advanced topics more effectively than the limited coverage in the book."
2,Collection of articles and advanced ideas for model rocketeers,"While the book covers some interesting aspects of mid and high model rocketry, it is not as comprehensive as other books and dated given the advances in the hobby of the past years. If you are looking for a book to complement your model rocketry library, this will be a useful addition. If you are looking to take the step from basic model rocketry into mid or high power model rocketry, there are other books that better describe ""how to""."
2,Second Stage: Advanced Model Rocketry,"Good for general information, but not specific enough to seriously build a high power rocket."
2,a good book but not for me,I was the commander of my highschools AFJROTC Rocket Club so my godfather bought em this book it is very informative but if you are just building basic este kits then this is way to advanced for you as it was for me and the other cadets in the club but if you are really into rockets this book is for you
4,This is how you make the metal record of the year...,"Birds of Prey is a fantastic metal record. Equal parts sludgy, speedy, squawky, foggy, and throaty all at once - adding up to one hell of a fun head banging recording. The subject matter is about as tasteful as i can imagine an inbred-mutant orgy. Consider this album a monster heaping of smoked sweet leaf garnish, and fully awash in smokey mountain whisky and moonshine. Sit back, drink and smoke up and listen to the magic."
1,Very Poor Educational Toy,This toy is supposed to introduce spanish to toddlers but it includes incorrect information. Just look at the alphabet; it's incomplete! Giving this toy to your child would be a terrible way to kick off their spanish language education.
5,Absolutely correct - Real Academia de la Lengua Espanola,"The letters that this version is ""missing"" are absolutely correctly not included in accordance with the Real Academia de la Lengua Espanola (the institution aimed at monitoring the proper use of Spanish language). In the 90's the letters ""ch"", ""ll"" and ""rr"" were deleted from the Spanish language alphabet. Therefore, the only difference between the English and Spanish alphabets is the ""n"", which is included on this toy.If that is not how you choose to teach your child, and prefer to use a more historical alphabet, that is fine. However, the toy is not currently academically incorrect at all."
4,Great Activity for Baby!,"My 8 month old son loves this table. He likes to stand and use all of the functions on the table. His favorite is turning the ""page"" which is also the toggle between spanish and music. I have to say that the music is his favorite and the spanish may confuse him. However, if you plan on teaching your child spanish, this is a great tool."
4,A must for seniors as well as csregivers,"The book is a gresat resource for seniors, living on their own, as well as for caregivers. It is easy to read and there are tips that I never would have thought of."
5,A big help,Ordered this book from seeing it online. It was an easy read and I got a lot of tips from it (I started helping take care of my mother this year). Definately recommend.
1,Unfortunate Shipping,Item was not wrapped properly for shipping and arrived chipped. Decided to return and order from another seller.
3,Not as good as the previous three,"I've just started reading the Honor series. I haven't been able to put them down....until I got to this one. I felt like the first half of the book really dragged (Give it 2 stars). However, starting around pg. 250 things really got going (Give it 5 stars)! I like the way that Weber keeps things interesting by focusing on different aspects of Honor's universe. It keeps the books from being just Honor killing another Peep ship. I think it was a good idea for Weber to explore the impact of Honor on Grayson's society, but the execution of the idea could have occured at a faster pace, or been less predictable, or something. However, I still look forward to every book about Honor with anticipation."
4,Honor Harrington5 : Honor Rides again,In Flag in Exlie Honor has settled in on Grayson. Her Steading is prospering things are going well for awhile. Then it happens! Again Haven returns and Honor get the chance to go back into space. Not as a captain but as an Admiral. Haven is only one battle she must fight. Her enemies on Grayson Plot to have her removed in many ways. and through one Cowardly act(That the author comments on since it's parralells somethng that happens years later in our world.)Honor must defend herself again losing more friends Honor must take the field of Honor again. I have read the first Five HH books in a row now and She Grows more as a person. if you like a strong characters and exciting storyline this is a great addition to the HH universe.
4,Good action great adventure,As with all David Weber stories this was a well-written and well thought out continuation of a long tale that has not yet seen its and I look forward very much to more from this author
4,Honor Harrington #5,"David Weber continues to create exciting, well written stories. The characters are well developed and continue to grow. You should start with the first in the series, however."
1,Flag in Exile,"The copy of this book that I received has internal damageto the spine. I am afraid it will not last past very manyperusals before it disintegrates, unfortunately.Sincerely yours, Tony Racki"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Despite being a naval officer, Honor Harrington is now playing the roleof a Baroness, basically, on the planet of Grayson. After the death ofher boyfriend in the previous book, she is working on the ground.Yet another conflict looms, and she is commissioned as an admiral for the fleet of her current planet of residence."
3,Pimps N Hoez,This little documentry here is sorta nice some females in it and the focus on the pimps can get boring at times but this is a good video to watch. Ice tea also makes his pimp appreance but if your looking for a tape full of females try Luke Freakshow vol 3
4,2nd best Pimp DVD,"This film makes a good combination to own with the American Pimp DVD.AP is more polished bling-bling presentation and more educational interviews with Pimps, whereas PUHD is lower budget and seems to catch the Pimps just showing off to the camera, spouting cliches and not go as in depth in knowledge with interviewing them. So what does PUHD offer?But PUHD has plenty of footage of the men and women in action and is a MUST HAVE along with American Pimp DVD, Pimp and Naked Soul by Iceberg, Space Age Pimping by Paradise, Gentleman Pimp by Stonewall."
2,Ho's Up and Pimp's Down,"First thing, I saw all three parts, and still this movies was just another excerpt for American Pimp. If you have American Pimp you have seen enough. You have some of the same characters and same mind-set. Okay, is has real footage, so, but I can go see that anywhere.I wanted to know more than just some comments from pimps. I wanted to understand the mindset of pimpin."
1,Dissapointing,"Judging by the name of the movie, it should have been interesting. But all you get is an hour and a half about how hard it is to be a pimp. (Pimpin' ain't easy!) I don't know if the filmers had this in mind, but everyone came off as being amazingly stupid. I mean I'm dumb for renting this movie, but the pimps and the ho's are really, really dumb. Complete morons. I guess that probably doesn't suprise you though, huh?"
1,Poorly Done,"This ""documentary"" on the game wasn't well done at all. Most of the macks don't even seem credible. (See the lesbian pimp who gets engaged to one of her girls; Mr. Whitefolks - 'nuf said) If you want to see a documentary with some historical context and some legitimate pimps, I would recommend ""American Pimp"" by the Hughes Bros. rather than this home video/film. The only bright spot of this film was the scene where Don ""Magic"" Juan spots a teenanged reader of his autobiography, and frankly tells the young man ""Don't do this to yourself... be a doctor or a lawyer..."". Overall this film gets a D-."
1,"Pimping Is Easy, And No One Should Do it","This is a complete and total waste of footage. Anyone who feels the need to glamorize pimps, who are ALL women hating, lying losers, needs to take a belt off and beat themselves with it. I saw this once on cable and it left a bad taste in my mouth. There is NOTHING glamorous or attractive about a group of ugly, unintelligent males parading around bragging about how they abuse these women. This movie stars the biggest assortment of losers ever to be assembled onscreen. These pimps are ridiculous. If these morons can be pimps, then it MUST be easy. They couldn't get me to sell a pack of gum for them, let alone my body.I actually give this crud zero stars."
3,Good not great,"Hoped this was going to be all that I remembered it being. Haven't watched all the episodes but the ones I have seen are a bit hoeky. Good but not great, so far anyway."
3,Would have been 5 stars but...,"Lovers of the original Bonanza will like these episodes. The video is good, the audio is loud & clear, you don't have to turn the volume up like other dvd's but....That wonderful theme music is missing both at the beginning & at the end - that cost this one starBUT EVEN WORSE !!! ... (and costing another star)The Platinum Video people must think it's OK to put their name and a logo in the bottom right of the screen. I DON'T !!!I hate it on broadcast & cable TV and I wouldn't have bought this if I'd known about the logo.Platinum Video in on my ""no buy list"" because of that logo policy."
5,Bonanza: Second Season Volume 1,"Thank you, Andrew Klyde, Paramount and CBS for putting out Bonanza (finally) on DVD. I can't wait for Volume 2 and so on. These beautifully put together DVD's are a joy to watch especially since TV Land cuts these episodes up. It's wonderful to see them again uncut. I recommend Season 1 and Volume 1 of Season 2 for anyone who's interested in the show, in westerns or just good entertainment. Thank you again and keep the seasons coming. I'll be first in line to buy each one."
2,Bonanza: 8 -DVD Pack,Why doesn't someone put out ALL of the episodes? Especially the comedies like Hoss and the Leprachauns!! This collection is okay though.....
5,Enjoy the Oldies,Never realized how easy it must have been to make a series back then. Makes me want give it a try. Classic a young Michael Landon.
5,THIS IS A GREAT SHOW.,"I'M SO GLAD THIS HAS CAME OUT, IT HAS SOME OF MY FAVOURITE EPISODES LIKE THE RESCUE, THE GIFT, AND SAM HILL JUST TO NAME A FEW. HOPEFULLY THEY KEEP RELEASING THEM AND IT WONT TAKE SO LONG FOR THE NEXT SEASON TO BE RELEASED."
1,BONANZA's great; this collection stinks,"Simply put: Do not buy this or any other bootleg set. BuyBONANZA: The Official First SeasonandBONANZA: The Official Second Season vol. 1released by CBS Paramount; these are the ONLY seasonal sets licensed by Bonanza Ventures and NBC Universal. You'll get all the episodes in this set plus more episodes from the first two seasons, plus great extras including photo galleries, trailers, interviews with creator-producer David Dortort and more. And all the episodes are un-cut, have the original music (including the classic theme song) and look great because they are re-mastered from the original film elements. BONANZA -- the Real Deal -- Rocks! And if you still want official BONANZA for less money -- avoid the bootlegs! -- and getThe Best of BONANZAput out by Artisan several years ago. No extras, but the episodes have great picture and sound quality and are complete and uncut."
3,"Season 2, both volumes","I have discussed this with others who bought season 2...the sound is not satisfactory. The dialogue is so low I have to increase the volume then the music or sound effects come on too loud and I have to decrease the volume. I do not know if anyone else has complained, but several fans and I have discussed this...Season 1 was just so awesome."
5,MORE please!!!,"Wow! These look GREAT and the wave of nostalgia just washes over you! This is when television was a FULL season...not 13 episodes called a 'season' like it it today. Here you have at least twice as many episodes for a REAL season.PLEASE...keep putting these out on DVD, FASTER if possible and please consider FULL seasons in one set instead of half season sets."
4,Pretty good lunch replacement when watching calorie intake,"I've used this line of meal replacement shakes for a few months when working on losing weight (read: fat). It's amazing how well something like this can make you feel full with so few calories, yet still give you the energy you need to make it to the next meal without snacking. The Bavarian Chocolate flavor is great, though you need to let it sit for a while after mixing with the liquid or else it has a dusty flavor. Compared to most other products this is an excellent deal at well under $1 per serving. Careful of the other two flavors, in my opinion the vanilla one is just awful and the strawberry one is bad, though tolerable."
5,Perfect!,"This was perfect for my needs which was not as a phone cord. I bought a 9ft table umbrella net in the beginning of summer, it was great, but the string at the top of the net became fragile, probably due to wind, rain, heat, etc. My idea was to find a cord to thread through the top of the net so that it would be every lasting and it works perfectly. If you're looking for a 50 ft telephone cord it would be perfect for that too:-)"
5,Perfect...,"After moving my home office to a different section of the house I needed a long enough cable to connect my fax modem and desktop phone. This was the right choice for price, size and features. Worked perfectly on first connect and I'm happy with the whole purchase... Great seller!!"
4,Problem Solved!,"Ok, so I was trying to cheap it out and just use an old cord in my office to have a hard wired connection to my office internet..... which the wire connection is on the opposite side of the room from my computer. (isn't that the way it always happens?) Ok, so anyway.... I had been having connection issues, and my old cord (which the tabs were broken off of) apparently was the issue. You see.... those tabs are IMPORTANT, because they help keep a solid connection. *lightbulb moment*. So... in the end why did I wait so long? Especially.... since this cord was SO inexpensive.... and was delivered swiftly.So...if you're wondering if you should get a new cord. the answer is YES."
2,Used for DSL,This cord should not be used for DSL. It says you can but my older cord had a stronger signal and transfer rate.
2,Marginal,"This cord may work for many applications, but its conductors have an incredibly high resistance of 0.65 ohms per foot. That is about 15 times the resistance of high quality cords. I am sure it will fail in some uses and work poorly in others."
5,It's a phone cord,It is a phone cord and works as a phone cord is supposed to. The length is really nice and I would recommend this to a friend.
4,Great!,Its a cord. Its a long cord. Its white. Its inexpensive. It worked for my needs! Would purchase again if needed.
3,No complaints.,Needed a cord to run from the front of my house to the back. This does it and it's pretty good quality. The white gets a little dirty though.
3,GE phone line cord,This cord was purchased as a replacement for one chewed by one of my dogs. It connects the phone with a direct tv 'box' for phone and ordering. It has worked well so far.
5,Phone Line Cord,"What can I say, phone cords have been around for several decades now, they do a good job at what they do and they just work. I needed phone cord to connect to a phone in another room and this did the trick. A fifty foot phone line cord for 5.39$(at time of writing) on Amazon with free prime shipping is a killer deal. Do I recommend this? Yes, a good cord for a good price."
4,line cord,Cheapest way to have a phone in another room. Just worked perfectly to extend my phone lines into another part of the house.
2,Not what I expected,"As usual I jumped into buying something without reading the fine print or these reviews!I thought I was getting a label maker that was easy, that could ""read"" the cd and list the songs automatically, after I pick the style. It doesn't. I have to manually type the tracks and information. Also, it is not adapatable to any other paper than their own memorex.No thanks."
1,Terrible!,"First of all, despite the claim that it works with MacIntosh, it definately does not. There is a template that you can use in Mac with Word, Claris, and other photoshop software, but there are no instructions as to how. Once you think you have it figured out (on the page) it doesn't print the same as pictured. The technial support people have no idea how to make it work with Mac, and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers. In any case, they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the Word template for MacIntosh. Don't waste your money. (I gave it one star only because no stars is not an option.)"
2,Don't bother using the software that comes with this kit,"The main reason I bought this kit was for the label applicator, the software was secondary. Good thing that I didn't care about how good the software would be, because the software for this is, in a word, deplorable.It doesn't have support for ANY other label sheets other than the memorex brand, which leaves you stuck with their labels. Its got some nice features in the software, but their poorly implemented. For instance, it can automatically resize an image to fit a CD/DVD, but if you've rotated it before that, the rotation is lost. It has a lot of minor quirks like that, and they add up to an annoyance to use this.If you get this product, find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator."
1,Bad Compatibility,"I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS LABEL MAKER NO MATTER WHAT!!!,"This thing is horrible. The software ""installed"", but doesn't run. It locks up my computer...can't do anything until I go to the task manager and close out the ""not responding"" program. Tech support is USELESS!! My system meets all of the requirements, but they have no clue what's wrong. They just say ""your computer doesn't work for some reason"". I KNEW THAT ALREADY!!! Duh! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. I promise to NEVER buy another Memorex product for as long as I live. Their product sucks and their customer service/tech support sucks. In this economy, how many customers can you afford to alienate?"
1,Garbage,"As usual, a ""Christian"" book is disguising itself as an authority on something about which it obviously knows little. This epistle twists everything around to make it look like every goth kid is doomed to a life of debauchery and decadence. I grew up a goth kid and I dare say a good share of them are the Hello Kitty crowd and wouldn't hurt a flea. I admit some are lost in this world, but that just makes them intelligent and without an outlet for change. Is that such an awful thing? I think you could read pure fiction and get more out of it than this book. Don't waste your money. Sara Trollinger is a frightening woman who I wouldn't let within a million miles of my child (no matter what their problems). And since when is a tattoo an inherently evil thing? A butterfly, a heart? Jeb Bush and the Campus Crusade for Christ may think she's great, but beware of this one. I think she's nuts! Why do they all come from Florida?"
3,Nice Recording,"Good recording of Middle Eastern tunes, although it didn't strike me as all that dynamic. Professionally performed, but, it seems to me, without an obvious zeal or spirituality. The tunes are mostly subdued, but some are very nice. Nothing too bold here, however. I get the sense that this is more or less just a going-through-the-paces recording destined for the Western esoteric market. Likely not a purchase that I would repeat."
1,Total and utter nonsense,"I cringe when I think about the picture that the Non-Indians must be getting about India after reading this garbage. The things the author describes in this book DO NOT happen in India, might have happened when my grandmother was 16 (even that, I am not sure). The author has no clue, absolutely none whatsoever, about the mentality of Indian parents or the arranged marriage system. I feel like suing the author and the publishers for printing this rubbish. And all those who feel that you are getting a glimpse into the Indian marriage system after reading this, please wake up. This is NOT what happens, this is NOT how indian parents are, you are getting a glimpse into NOTHING except the author's idiotic imaginations."
3,Chic - Lit at best,"Overall the book isn't one of the better ones, the most accurate description I could come up with was Chic lit. Its written well enough for you to keep moving through the book. Has some rather hilarious situations that I could, as an unmarried 30 yr old Indian woman, could relate to... or foresee happening if I came from a family that believed in arranged marriages. I wouldn't reccomend it to someone looking to get to know Indian culture or authors, or someone expecting another Juhmpa Lahiri, but rather for a good beach reading book.By the way why is it that EVERY Indian female author seems to get compared to either Jhumpa Lahiri or Arundhati Roy? Do none of you know of any other Indian authors? By that rate should every American author be compared to.... say Mark Twain, or Toni Morrison, or any other poet laureate? Not every one is going to write a Booker Award winning novel... and to pick up any Indian author and expect them to match the quality is just plain silly."
4,Every Indian Girl has these moments!,I liked this book.Every girl has a moment in their life where they feel like they might never meet that special someone.This book gives proof to the saying someone where is out there for you.Also it teaches about timing is something that only fate controls!!
3,indian chick lit,"There don't seem to be too many Indian chick lit books out there that are not depressing. This one is light and an easy read, while giving us american-borns a peek into the fascinating world of Indian dating and marital customs. Worth your while to read."
4,laugh out loud,"Any Indian girl that is of matrimonial age and has gone through the experience of having her family and community try to find her a husband will love this book. There were so many elements that I could relate to and times when I just couldn't stop laughing because it described my life so well. The main character is torn between the life she was born to have and the life that was given to her, and like many of us she does everything she can to make everybody else in her life happy; while thinking of herself last. This is a quick read but still a book that makes you think, and one that will stay with you even after you turn the last page."
5,Can totally relate with the book!!!,"I picked up this book from a bookstore in Mumbai on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised when I read it. It surpassed my expectations and the more I read it, the more I got involved with the characters of the book. The central character of the book - Anju is so much like the new-age, evolved Indian woman. Independent, intelligent and will not settle for second best. The book is about a one-woman search for the perfect Indian husband. The story is spread over two continents - India and USA. I could not put down the book, till I did not find out what sort of mate Anju finally landed up with... Kudos to Kavita Daswani for writing about such amazing characters..."
3,Eh...So what's the point?,"I'm an avid reader of almost any type of fiction (a really wide range, believe me). Lately, I've been into fiction revolving Indian/South Asian culture. Alas, this book takes the subject of arranged marriage and sort of mangles it. The protagonist is considered an ""old maid"" for still not being married at the age of 33. But this entire story is all about her search for ""the one"" to marry (as arranged by her parents, relatives, whatnot). She even moves to New York not because she wants to better herself, she moves there to a) try to find a husband; and b) escapes people's criticisms of her. She find a great new life there, but no, she's still whining about not having a husband.The book goes back and forth into time but it's all about the same thing. ""Why can't I find a husband?"" Well you know why? Because the protagonist is a whiny, self-pitying, spoiled lady! I recommend you borrow this book! Don't buy it!"
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"To sum it up, this book is another example of a lost opportunity to realize the potential of an interesting theme, namely the juxtaposition of two cultures and its effect on one individual. The writing is simplistic and cliche-ridden, and the number of references to pop culture will give the book the shelf life of a BenLo movie. Superficial and manufactured, this one will take little time to read and even less time to forget."
1,"Mildy amusing at best, trite at worst","Overall this was a read-it-while-you're-at-the-gym novel. It's more like watching a mindless sitcom than reading a book. The story was painfully cliched, both in terms of the Indianisms and Americanisms. Fashion industry in New York? Puhleaze. Visiting a swami in Bombay? Whatever. As an Indian, I found it rather alienating reading about an Indian lifestyle I have never personally encountered. As an American, I felt much the same.There are a few amusing scenes in the book, but not enough to make it a ""must read"" as other reviewers have recommended. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, pick up this novel. Just don't expect to be wowed."
5,Wonderful!,"As a desi born and raised in the US and still trying to maintain the culture, this is a wonderful book. It TRULY tells the inside thoughts of desi american girls today and insightfully describes the very real matrionial process. KUDOS!"
4,a fun read! lighthearted and lovely,"This bubbly book was an entertaining and lighthearted read. Readers who criticize the main character for being superficial are missing the point. Similarly, those who criticize the ""unrealisticness"" of a character being into fashion and work, while at the same time longing for tradition and comfort, underestimate the multi-layered potential of the human life. I found the main character, Anju, to be very realistic, and even though I have no firsthand knowledge of Indian culture, I sympathized with the common feminine dilemma of wanting to please while at the same time wanting to be self-actualized. That being said, this is not a serious book, so don't get too deep in the analysis! Enjoy it and have fun! Great insight into Indian culture, by the way."
4,Loved It!!,"I loved this book. This is a must read!1You feel the character's pain,you understood her family life, i also cried in some parts. Very sad that the book ended. Must read!!"
4,A Delightful Book,"Kavita Daswani's book ""For Matrimonial Purposes"" will make you smile throughout as you keep reading. Well written - this book will give you insights into arranged marriages among the upper middle class Hindu community in India and make you chuckle.This book takes you on a journey between India and the U.S. and find out for yourself ""Will Anju find herself a husband or will her parents find one for her"". This is a must read book for all Asian Hindu women in the U.S. - how they can be independent as well as retain their Hindu marriage culture. A must read book for all women who are curious about arranged marriages in India. Well done Kavita."
4,Not Disappointed,"Anju, the protagonist, is searching for a husband. The practical side of husband searching can be appreciated, as Anju is not altogether pre occupied with love. Anyone who enjoys a degree of personal freedom from their parents stands to be utterly frustrated by Anju's overbearing, overprotective parents. As an American I enjoyed reading about all the different aspects of a culture with which I've had limited experience. However, I just couldn't help but wonder the whole time if Bombay parents truly act as Anju's had or if hers was an isolated case."
4,An engaging read,"The themes of this story ring true for everyone. Living up to the expectations of your parents and family vs. doing what truly makes you happy. I enjoyed the glimpse into the Indian culture and the caste/class society. I found the story's herione, to NOT be a spoiled brat, but a young woman searching for a sense of self first within and then beyond the cultural expectations of her family. A good choice for a rainy day read."
1,What a waste!,"A non-resident Indian ""Successful"" woman living in USA does not a good writer make. This book is a clear example of this. The novel revolves around very trite and caricaturish characters. There are no original thoughts or ideas which would be even mildly amusing or thought-provoking. The language and the formation of sentences is amateurish, the characters uni-dimensional. Even the main protagonist - Anju is a character whom you couldn't care less for. The book can at best be viewed as a weblog on any of the numerous expatriot Indian diaspora websites. AVOID IT."
3,Only if you are desparate,"The beginning was great ...the middle was boring (I skipped chunks of it)...and the end was ok. The author keeps going on and an on, and after awhile i just got too annoyed with the fashion name droppings. Yes, the main charachter is in the fashion industry, but do we HAVE to know the brand name of every pair of shoes/t-shirts/handbags she owns?"
1,Boring,"I usually like books in this genre. However, this one was boring. You will be skipping pages just to get to the end. The character of Anju was too conflicting: she acts as though she's this totally cool, hip New Yorker, but she is also perfectly content to marry whomever her parents wish. The ending was terrible! What a pathetic cop-out!"
2,"dies fast, but OK if cheap","cheap battery cells, but if you get it cheap, like $2-3, worth it; otherwise, its GE junk! I doubt it is really 1300mAh. Probably more like 700mAh w/ a short life."
3,UNFORTUNATE 'MASCULINE' TRAITS IN OUR BOYS,"Myriam MiedzianBoys Will Be Boys:Breaking the Link Between Masculinity and Violence(New York: Doubleday, 1991) 337 pagesA comprehensive attempt to understand and correctthe enculturation of boys to be: macho, tough, dominant,callous toward women, eager to seek danger and to fight.Boys are not naturally hard, violent, insensitive,ruthless, militaristic, competitive, & power-hungry.We train these personality characteristics into our boysthru team sports and the glorification of war.The absence of sensitive, empathetic fathers--from the home and from the media--leaves boys without such role-models.Television super-heroes succeed thru violence.Heroes who mediate rather than heroes who fightwould help our boys to grow into better men.If you would like to discover other such books,search the Internet for the following exact words:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
2,Don't bother,"It's true that a covers album doesn't mean that every band has to sound exactly like the original, but they should capture the spirit and essence of the original songs while adding their own unique sound. Unfortunately, the only tracks I really liked are Luca Turilli's ""I'm Alive"", and Dark Moor's very ambitious cover of ""Halloween"" (enjoyable if you don't mind the Spanish-accented female voice).The covers by Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica, and Secret Sphere sounded decent, but the rest of the CD is just bland or plain awful (e.g. ""A Little Time"" by Heaven's Gate is atrocious). Even Labyrinth's ""Future World"" was disappointing. And everyone in Cydonia should be turned into big, fat, half-priced pumpkins for creating such an insipid version of ""Save Us""."
5,Amazing,"An amazing revelational account. It contains lessons that are sure to enhance business, social as well as personal relationships. I recommended this to my sister and she agrees that it's a must read."
1,Don't bother getting this book!,This book has so little useful information such as when a person has their arms cross their closed and to their self(already know that!)Sure this book gives you pictures and not decent pictures a the least.After reading this book the only single use of information I have gained from this book is when a guy puts his hands on or by his waist he's trying to attract someone.Don't waist your money.And if you see the other reviews about how great this book is (like I fell for)and are tempted to buy it go to Borders bookstore and read it there.
3,Not Bad,"I recently entered the sales world. I realized during my short tenure how important body language is. This book does a good job of getting me started in at least one area. Being aware of my own body language, so others see me as more friendly and open.It is an easy read with ok pictures. If you know little or nothing about body language, this is a good book to start with. Just don't expect to know everything, because body language is not black and white. I do recommend the book. Yes, I do read reviews and have been fooled by them often. I sometimes wonder if some of these people are paid to give these outstanding reviews or if I just have higher expectations. Good reading."
3,A must read for radio buffs.,"The concept is new and exciting. Fans of radio will enjoy reading about charactors one hasn't heard from in awhile. I really enjoyed the ""Ma Perkins"" story as we don't hear much about this truly great show. This book is a great way for non radio people to be introduced to the lost art of radio soaps.A must read."
3,Interesting concept,"Overall, it's an interesting little book. The negatives are that because it is a new concept there is nothing to compare it to and about half of the shows written about are rare shows that even OTR enthusiests have never listened to (Ma Perkins, Tom Mix, Clyde Beatty Show, Candy Matson, Pat Novak). I just say that if you are going to make a book of OTR fiction, they need to make the fiction from shows people have listened to like Suspense, Lone Ranger, The Shadow, Escape, Gunsmoke, etc. The book does have some stories from popular shows like Quiet Please, Inner Sanctum, Johnny Dollar, Dimension X and Our Miss Brooks, but the story quality is a toss up. I did like the Rouge's Gallery story, the Johnny Dollar and the Dimension X (""Willoughby Goes And Gets It"" was a gem!). I will also say that the Our Miss Brooks story read more like an episode than any other story.I liked the author's ""The Great Gildersleeve"" a little more than this one, but recommend both to the diehard OTR fan."
4,Stout's somewhat snobbish bypath,"In this book Stout presents his other notable character besides Nero Wolfe: Tecumseh Fox, a self-made man who is quite a benefactor for a detective. Double for Death does not quite match the well-balanced rhythm and urban atmosphere of his better known Wolfe series. This book underlines a little bit too much how its plot relies on the nuances of the English language. The solution is obvious if the reader happens to have an eye for spellathlons; if not, too bad. Still, the story is readable, and definitely a must for any serious Stout fan just in order to help appreciate the discreetly designed Wolfe-Goodwin setup in most of his books."
4,One of my favorite mystery writers,"I have been waiting for the Nero Wolfe series to be available for Kindle, it seems like forever. I'm not as big a fan of Tecumseh Fox as Nero Wolfe, but a Rex Stout mystery is a Rex Stout mystery.I'm glad I purchased and read this book. It's a solid mystery with a good ending. I would expect that from Rex Stout. What I didn't expect, and really enjoyed, was the glimpses of Wolfe and Archie I got in Fox's personality. I found myself thinking, Wolfe would have said that or Archie would have done that.If another Fox book becomes available, I will definitely buy it. In the meantime, I am reading and loving ""Over My Dead Body"" featuring Wolfe and Archie."
3,Not a Nero Wolfe Story,"This is an interesting book because it's not a Nero Wolfe story, but it's a murder mystery that was duplicated in the Nero Wolfe series, but in this story, the same murder is being solved by Tecumsah Fox, Stout's other detective. It's the Tingley's Tidbits murder, where someone is putting quinine into Tingley's Tidbits.I much prefer Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin to Tecumsah Fox, but this is still a good book."
2,No Wonder They're Sold in Combination,"The almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring, which is subtle but nice. The cashews, on the other hand, are hard to believe. The taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi-pervious containers in the paint-and-finishing room of my high school industrial arts class. They are REALLY awful, and any lover of cashews will be appalled."
2,Contents Didn't Match Carton Label,"After opening the box and one of the inner containers, I realized that despite the carton being labeled as almonds and cashew halves, the inner containers were an assortment of peanuts (dry-roasted, cocktail and honey-roasted).Amazon did give me a partial credit (since I had already opened one of the containers), but I wound up paying for a lot of peanuts I didn't really want."
1,buyer beware,"Read the fine (or missing) print carefully. This is not a general purpose vacuum purchase. You need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets (another $100). If you want to return this item, they charge a restocking fee of 10% and also deduct for the shipment (even if you got ""free"" shipping) AND you pay to ship the thing back. We ended up buying locally from Sears and are much happier with it than from Central Vacuum Stores - which is where the Miele came from."
4,Great vac,"I've never had a high end vacuum before, so I don't have alot to compare it to. That being said, I am very happy with this unit. It's much smaller than I expected, relatively quiet and works just as advertised. The carpet attachment works fine for me. Between the attachments, it's light weight and long tube, I'm cleaning much more often and better than I ever have before. It's a very well designed, very well made vacuum."
2,forget carpeting,"I really want to love this vacuum based on reviews and the price I paid for it. Yes, it's lightweigh. Yes, the bags are small but you can find very good knock off ones sold here on Amazon. But honestly, it's just ok. I have some area rugs and wall to wall carpeting on the stairs and it is just the pits. Forget about anything with any pile on it. So after spending $400 I need to spend another $129 for a turbo brush attachment? This just does not seem right."
2,Pricey but not impressed,"Just having new wood floors installed,Ineed a vacuum that would do both wood floors and carpet. It was an expensive vacuum but I thought it would be worth the price if it could both floors well and last a long time. I bought the antares model. It was $479. It had good suction,was quiet and light-weight;however, I would have had to purchase the power nozzle for another$249. to do the carpets and the parquet brush to adequately do the wood floors for another $50 dollars. Much too expensive for my taste!!"
5,Like a German sports car...,"This is a great piece of quality craftsmanship and engineering. It is a joy to use. Everything is simple and intuitive, from the suction control to the silky smooth swiveling attachments that allow you to pilot your way under any piece of furniture with ease. The power is great, but I do agree with T. Bullard that you should do your homework before buying one. The turbo brush is great for my low pile carpet, but I don't know how it would perform on thicker rugs.Highly recommended."
5,competetn gynocologist!!!!!!!!,i revewd fisher price Anjelica makovr doll and i siad we were having a baby.well we are!!!!!Anjelica is pregnant and this is our gynocologist!!!!!hes very good.i think you need to see him.he gives her good examshe knows are baby is savehes going to deliver himhes a great doctor and we think hes nice.anjelica relly likes him and thats all that matters!!!
2,Borders on show tunes,"The audio quality is great, as is most often the case with Reference Recordings. However, there are far better chorales and compositions than represented on this cd. The content strikes me as saccharine. We're not allowed to mention other recordings in reviews, but I put one idea of some good choral music (chorale la) in the recommended instead section."
2,Didnt fit my phone,"Even tho I checked the manufactures fit guide as Amazon suggests, this battery still didnt fit my phone. (Note: the batteries are AA size, and my phones are AAA size)."
1,Didn't fit my At&T coreless phone,Bought two of these but didn't fit my AT&T phone. The description on the product is misleading!
3,cute but a little light on content,"If you're looking for a humorous quick read this book will suffice. However, its not going to make you go ""yep that's me"" or ""I recognize that"" as much as others of the genre might"
2,Schmaltzy love letter to Canada,"This book could have been a lot better than it was. I thought it was going to have at least a little bite to it, but instead, every page broadcasted the same (incredibly inoffensive) message: ""I love Canada!!! YAY!!!""I love Canada too, but there are a lot of silly (and stupid) things about the country as well. If this book had shown more of the silly things, this would have been a much better buy."
4,Good book but too short,"I am really interested in exploring the option to live in Canada - that's why I purchased this book in the first place. The book references to life in Canada in a humourous manner and is practically intented to familiarize Americans with the Canadian facon de vivre.. It was a fast and fun read though I wished it had more information on everyday Canadian life basics and differences between cities like Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa."
4,A nice distraction,"This is a cute little book with charming illustrations and bouncy writing. I think it would make a great gift for any American visitor to Canada.That being said, I must admit I frequently found it to be a bit nauseatingly self-aggrandizing at times. There's very little humor, it's mostly just ""rah rah look how great Canada is."" To the extent that anything is critical, the ""criticism"" is usually something along the lines of ""we Canadians are TOO nice.""Ah well. At least the book is not anti-American, unlike much literature of this sort. And I guess the self-aggrandizing Canadian attitude is just as much a part of the modern Canadian cultural identity as hockey or beavers.You can learn a lot about Canada from this book in more ways than one."
2,Not so much after reading this book...,"So I realized I don't want to live the rest of my life on Cape Cod, I like the cold and the ocean, so maybe a small village in Canada? Not as funny as I had hoped, and way too much emphasis on alcohol and drugs. No thanks Canada, I won't fit in up North."
4,Fun Cute Book About a Cute Fun People,"The authors of So, You Want To Be Canadian (it should by all rights have an ""eh"" at the end of that sentence) have hit on all the essential topics in their humourous attempt to explain Canada to the rest of the world. Maybe it is not much more than beer, hockey, and beavers that make us so special but maybe that is more than enough if some combination of those three things make a people set up universal healthcare, be very polite to one another, and wear toques. After a long time in the United States, this book was a sweet little breath of cooling Arctic air and a chance to laugh at and with my homeland. A few mistakes pop up here and there but for such a slight book it provides a number of laughs and that is a good thing, eh."
3,"It's worth a blog post, not a book","The text is OK and funny most of the time, but in my opinion it's worth a blog post or webpage, not a book. It lacks deepness and more ""meat"", being just a collection of short sentences mixed with lots of ilustrations."
5,Pathway to Roses-Eternal Wisdom,"This book was written almost 100 years ago and still serves as a light in our information drenched world. Love, faith, and abundance weave their way through the pages of this book to create a tangible plan of action for the inspired. So often esoteric topics leave you with a feeling and not a plan, yet this book let's you know that in no uncertain terms, ""That faith without works is dead"" and life without love is a charade.Beautiful poems, phenomenal thoughts, provoke a sense of urgency for the reader to move past hope to the combustionable effects of faith filled activities."
2,the pathway of roses review,I own a hardbound copy of this book and I love it. This new paperback which I purchased as a gift for a family member had so many spelling errors in it that you couldn't understand its content.
2,Kindle Version Flawed,"I would give this book 4 to 5 stars on content, however the Kindle sample is absolutely FULL of typos, bad enought to render some words and phrases completely indecipherable. The page breaks and page numbering are also poorly done with page numbers showing up in the middle of paragraphs and no breaks between chapters. Until the publisher fixes this I would recommend the print version only."
5,Highlights of Freddie Mercury's solo material,"Like Queen, Freddie Mercury as a solo artist cannot be pigeonholed into one category. His catalogue is too broad and styles are too diverse to classify him as merely a rock artist. This collection puts onto two discs numerous highlights of Freddie's solo works, which range from the Queen-esque ""Mr. Bad Guy"" to duets with opera star Monserrat Caballe. Those who love Queen will find this a worthy addition to their collection, even if it is slightly heavy on remixes and remakes. All in all, this is a great introduction to Freddie Mercury, solo artist."
5,Freddis Mercury,Got this cd for my boyfriends who ended up loving it! It has his fav. songs and listens to it all the time!
4,Not as good as with Queen,"I was somewhat disappointed. I love Freddy Mercury's voice, but was not as good as his recordings with Queen. Some songs were great, others were hard to listen to."
3,Not a lot of songs I love as much as I love Freddie w/Queej,"Love Freddie's pipes, but find only a few of these songs as pleasing as when he sang with rest of Queen. I bought it, but doesn't add as much to my collection as I'd hoped. Still go back to Radio GaGa, Who wants to live forever, Barcelona, Bohemian Rhapsody, etc."
4,Great product!!!!,"I love the CDs the music is great however the second CD has the same song in a slower mode, good but get repetitive afte while. I still recomend it the song are classics great great great music!!! ;-)"
3,This is a fair sample of the Geto Boys' work,"Most of the songs are from other Geto Boys albums, some are remakes, others are just copied and pasted in. Bushwick Bill is the comic relief in what tend to be dark musical works. Scarface comes from the perspective of a paranoid manic depressive drug dealer. Willie D comes off as a part time hustler. This album has many of the classic tracks of old school hip hop."
3,About the Korean War,"A novel of American prisoners of war in Korea. Details the psychological and physical torture were they subjected to. The author, a Navy helicopter pilot who was a prisoner during the Korean War, was the model of the helicopter pilot in Michener's ""The Bridges of Toko-Ri"".SERGEANT WOLFE WAS AN AMERICAN SOLDIER ON HIS WAY BACK FROM THE COMMUNIST PRISONS OF KOREA SURROUNDING HIM ON THE TRUCK WERE OTHER AMERICANS--SOME JUBILANT OVER THEIR APPROACHING FREEDOM, OTHERS MISERABLE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD BETRAYED THEIR FELLOWS AND THEIR COUNTRY. WOLFE, AND MEN LIKE HIM, KNEW FROM THE DEEP CONVICTION OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES UNDER ""BRAINWASHING"" THAT THE COMMUNISTS WERE NOT IRRESISTIBLE, THAT ALL MEN DID NOT HAVE A BREAKING POINT... ."
5,"An Excellent Resource, And A Great Read Too","A fantastic book of quotations, and the most comprehensive collection of humorous quotes I've yet to come across. The organization is excellent, with an adequate list of themes serving as the table of contents. Further aiding discovery of the perfect quote is an index of authors/sources, and a very well developed keyword index. Both of these supplemental indices are a bit confusing, but not overly so. They list the applicable theme and the numbered entry under that theme; there are no page numbers given. It's a bit confusing on the first few uses, after that it is simple.The book is a fun, quick read as well, dense (with its relatively small print) with goodies from John Updike, Cheryl Tiegs, Henry Kissinger, Frank Zappa, George Foreman, P. J. O'Rourke, etc. I heartily recommend it."
4,A Great Quote Book,This book was great. I loved every quote. It had a lot of excellent ideas. I will make you laugh and teach you life leason's at the same time. One of my friends loaned it to me and I had to go out and get my own. If you like quotes then you will love this book.
2,"Could have been a good book, but","This book is written so poorly. Anthony should have spent a month or more actually reading through the book and questioning things, instead of writing it and leaving it at that. Is it even remotely believable that after Quality falls in love with Ernst that she tells his former fiance, ""Oh, I know a perfect guy for you, (who just happens to be my former fiance) if only you could meet ..."" And of course, they do meet, oh-so coincidently. That is just one example of things working out too neatly to be satisfying. Half the book reads like poor journalism, the other half like an adolescent attempt at literature. I hate to be harsh on Piers, but dang it, I want to see him go back to writing REAL novels, with real characters, real conflict, and a real plot."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I must agree with DKW. This is a bit of a missed opportunity. It's bad enough the compilers missed dance classics like ""I Can't Help It"" and ""I Want You Back"", but to not use the SAW 12"" of ""Love Truth and Honesty"" is a major disappointment. It's one of my favorite tracks from the girl group and it's represented here in an overlong and dull mix that zaps the Euro-NRG appeal of the original.I'm happy to have this compilation but considering the wait, I wanted much more."
3,"Ok, but I had hoped for more...","If you like Banaanarama then you may find a few remixes you like here. For me, well I had hoped for more. There are a few songs you've heard on the radio, but the remixes could be better. Bananarama has a new album out with new 2006 remixes (Drama) of their new songs, a much better choice for your money."
5,"The best ""girl group"" of the 80s made the best club music....","And the evidence is here as a collection featuring their 12"" singles on CD here for the 1st time!The Go-Go's were/are the best female rock band to emerge from the 80s new wave/punk movement, but across the pond, Bananarama emerged the best girl group. Their sense of fun, style and great pop songs remain untouched. The mixes of some of their best shine here, esp the 90s songs from their ignored, fan-fav album ""Pop Life"". Get it! And let's hope for a second volume w/ ext versions of ""the Wilde Life"", ""Hotline to Heaven"" and B-sides like ""Mr. Sleaze"" & ""Live Now"" surface. While you are at it, get Keren & Sarah's new CD ""Drama"" as well!"
4,GREAT CD BUT WISH IT HAD MORE HITS AND ORIGINAL MIXES,"OK, THIS IS LONG OVERDUE AND I'M HAPPY WITH IT. BUT WHY IS JACQUIE DEAD CENTER ON THE COVER - I MEAN, SHE ONLY SANG ON ONE ALBUM. I DON'T GET IT. SIOBAN SHOULD BE ON THE COVER."
2,"Perfect fit, but broke!!","I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation. This one is still perfect. I love the rubberized plastic feel, helps with it not sliding around on your hand.Update: Had the cover for less than a month, and one of the tabs on the side that holds it on snapped off. I am not rough with my ipad, and it does not get dropped. I take very good care of things. Now it's useless.Update 2: Seller shipped me a new one to replace my broken cover, and within a few more weeks, it broke as well. seems like stress fractures at the corners. I do not drop my ipad or be rough with it at all, and it still breaks."
2,Cheap,"This iPad cover is very cheap.It may not seem like,but one drop and the edges of the cover break off and it doesn't snap onto the iPad.I mean even if you accidentally dropped on CARPET!! Now I don't use the cover anymore and it was such a waste of money.My iPad is better off without a back cover.Although this is the same exact color as the front smart cover, overall, 2STARS."
1,It taste like vinegar,This is my second product that I purchased from vintner reserve. The first was white wine and it turned out very delicious. The merlot on the other hand turned out terrible. And I followed the directions to a 't'. I've emailed thecompany and I'm waiting for a response. I was hoping to find a helpful review of the product here that could tell me if perhaps I did something wrong or if there was something I could add to fix the wine. I hope I don't have to trash the whole batch cuz that's a giant waste of $$
4,Excellent overview of alcoholic families and the dysfunction,"This book was so relieving. To find reasons for ways my family functioned as a child and functions today as an adult. Sharon writes in a very objective way which is easy to understand and relate to. She has such vast experience, both personal and professional, in the field of family alcoholism which she shares in a well thought out and organized way. I could not wait to finish this book and move on to another one of her books, ""Another Chance"", which I am currently reading and becoming even more educated on my own co-dependent issues."
5,Great center piece,Kids love this item on the dinner table or in the kitchen. Its a fun and whimsical way to add a dash of fun to dinner time for the young and old alike.
5,Very Nice,I ordered it for Christmas for my sister because my family has a long running joke with S&P Shakers (My grandmother has over 200 sets easy) so since my sister just got married the family has decided to continue the tradition with her. And her nickname is frog because she's always so bouncy and hyper so I of course bought this. BEST thing ever. It comes very safely packaged and looks just like the picture.
1,Poor Quality Automated Copy,This book was automatically generated by a machine scanning an old version and attempting to convert the scanned pages into text (called OCR). Unfortunately the publisher doesn't proof read what comes out of their machine so the book is full of typos. So far about 20 in the first 10 pages.The publisher justifies this by saying that you can get access to a downloadable copy of the original which doesn't have typos. If I wanted to download the book I would have done that. I actually wanted a printed copy without typos. Is that too much to ask for? Apparently it is for this publisher.
4,Get Ready for a Spook,"Jackson Rutledge and Sabrina Osterling are total strangers but an ad in a newspaper for a house ""musty, dusty, and guaranteed haunted"" sends them both rushing to the real estate office. Both have their own personal reasons for their interest in the house. Jackson's easy going personality instantly makes him a likable character. He doesn't believe in ghosts but sees the House as the perfect setting for his future plans. Sabrina is different, weird, more aggressive and obsessed with the past. Her belief in the supernatural has brought her to the House for answers. But the House has other plans for Jackson and Sabrina.Time is the essence in The Butterfly House. T.K. Sheils will spook and horrify you with his story line and picture-painting description. You will realize just how precious time is and yet how we all take the present for granted. The evil of The Butterfly House will grip you, pull you in, and glue you to your seat while scaring you beyond belief."
5,Deserves Its Awards,"No wonder this book won the Independent Publisher Award for Best Horror, and the EPPIE Award in the same category! BUTTERFLY HOUSE is an entertaining read from page one to the finish. Part mystery, part horror--with the occasional quirky joke to break the tension--BUTTERFLY HOUSE is a great novel. This book made me surprised to find out that I like horror novels."
2,Butterfly House Promises But Disappoints,"I read every glittering review, thinking wow this book must really be worth $20. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The prologue was very promising, but immediately after that it changed its tone and became just another mainstream novella. The two main characters are sketched out only slightly, and there's not enough description of the house, events or ancillary characters to keep it interesting. By Chapter 14, more than 1/2-way through the book, I kept waiting for something to happen. If you want a good old-fashioned scare, stick to the master of the genre, Steven King. I will be selling this book on Amazon to try to recover some of the money I wasted on this book."
5,Good Read!,"A+! This is a really good book for anyone who wants to know more and indepth about Mary Magdalene. Great for bible studies,too!"
2,Tell me the truth but...,"I bought this book to have a better insight on her life and story. The first part of the book is about Mary M. if she lived today. It was a good story, but that is not what I bought the book for. The second part of the book is nothing but the writers view of religion and not about the life of Mary M. Oh well, you can't have it all."
3,Nice book!,"The book was well written presenting Mary Magdalene from our times as an outcast.I just did not like the ending of the story. Story was a bit predictable. I was hoping more from Liz. She is an outstanding writer. That is why I have raised a bar higher.Overall, it is a great way to give a closer look of Mary Magdalene from the bible. Liz followed the bible and brought it to our daylight."
3,A little weak,"I bought this battery as a backup for the LG battery that came with my phone. The LG battery wasn't lasting as long as I thought it should, but this one needs charging even sooner."
5,Good product,"This batery was new, come on time this shiptment is fast, the product is in good conditions thans for senden quicly."
3,ok battery,The battery has a lower life shelf life than the stock battery in your phone. Typically the battery begins losing charge quickly around 6-8 months. So far I've purchased 2 from this seller.
4,Replacement battery for LG CU500,"I decided to return to my LG CU500 after some frustration with my newer LG VU920. One of the reasons I bought the LG VU920 was that the battery packs I had for the CU500 just were not holding charge like it was when new. This battery I rate a a 4 because I still do not get the battery usage that I did when the phone was new and maybe it is the phone. Even when I keep Bluetooth off, I do not get a full days service. It indeed may be the phone and not this battery."
4,Good transaction!,The product seems to be as good as the original. It was delivered in a timely fashion. I would recommend this seller to my friends.
1,Lousy battery;,"It's thicker than the original LG battery, with much less capacity. I couldn't measure the claim of 700mAh, but I believe it's substantially less. The charge lasts only about a day, about 26hrs. That's WITHOUT ANY talking whatsoever; standby only. I ordered a total of three (3), they're all identical in lasting power, so it's not a fluke, they're all uniformly lousy."
3,Brand New LG CU500 Standard Lithium-Ion Battery,"These batteries appear to be working but they don't hold a charge throughout an entire day. The time they hold a charge has increased over the first two weeks, but they still don't last an entire day. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have bought a different phone."
2,Not for me.,"This was just not for me, everyone has different beliefs but I just could not agree with most of these."
1,"This is for Jehovah's Witnesses ONLY. It's a fake ""bible"".","No one on the ""Translation Committee"" could speak, read, translate, or interpret Hebrew, Aramiac, or Greek. The cult's leader reluctently admitted this under oath.Passages were changed for the purpose of lessening who Christ actually is and to hide why Jehovah God sent Him to earth. AVOID this work of fiction and the poor, mistreated people who carry it. They actually changed the Word of God. Could there be anything more offensive to God than that?"
1,NOT ACCURATE !,"If one studies this so called translation they will find it is NOT a translation at all. The man who was in charge of this work, admitted in court that he could not even read the Greek alphabet let alone understand the Greek language. They have ADDED and TAKEN AWAY to make the Holy Scriptures say what they desire them to say. I have over 30 different English Translations of The Holy Scriptures, and I would rate this one the WORST, by far, of them all."
2,New Wortd Translation is a sad commentary,"It is indeed unfortunate when someone publishes a supposedly accurate translation of God's Word but the many other translations that have been offered over the ages (King James, Revised King James, New American Standard, etc.) reveal an entirely different meaning of God's message to the world.The Jehovah Witnesses created this version of the Bible to support their cult beliefs and it distorts the true meaning and understanding of the Doctrine of the Trinity, as well as other theological precepts.It is sad that the Witnesses have spread this false teaching to so many over the years. Those who study this translation of the Bible should compare key passages (John 1:1-2) to see the false claims offered in the NWT."
1,False witness,"This is not a true translation, but a perversion of the truth. The texts have been changed to make the words say what the Watch Tower wants to convey. It is a dangerous thing to add to or take away from the true Word of God, But it is more dangerous to read and believe this perversion of truth.If you want the truth, read the King James Version. The New World Translation should not be allowed into your library. It's like letting the devil run loose in your home.Aren't there enough lies, and deceptions coming from the tube in your living room? Only the truth can set you free. Read the KJV."
1,Anti-God translation,"A book that twists scripture, distorts the Word of God and uses the word 'Jehovah', which isn't even found in the Jewish texts - should be YHWH (Yahweh).Despite the fact that the Bible warns against adding to and taking from the Word of God, the NWT has managed to do just that. An atrocious and dishonest translation.Contact me for furhter information at rogmaministries@tiscali.co.uk"
1,II Corinthians 11:14,"This translation denies key words of Life that pertain to everlasting life in glory with the Mighty Creator -Grace by faith in the only true Saviour Who redeemes us from the sin nature, Who died and rose again with a body on the cross, Jesus Messiah: ""Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."" (Luke 24:49)God's Love is HUGE. He made it readily available to bring many to glory. Don't let anything take this from you. Jesus died for us all. It's True Love in righteousness."
1,"Well, yes.","I don't know that I would say things like ""demonic Bible"" and ""vomited forth from the Pit"" like the previous reviewer, but ""deliberate distortion"" and ""mis-translated purposefully with a serious agenda,"" are things I would say. This version of the Bible continues to be an irritant and a darkener of counsel abroad in the world, and I think the best thing that serious, honest, legitimate scholars of the Bible and/or of Hebrew and Koine Greek can do is just say so every chance they get. Like now. Rather than read this ""translation,"" your time would be better spent learning to read Greek and Hebrew for yourself. Go."
3,Mostly for the difficulty in reading,"I'll leave the debate on the accuracy of this translation to scholars. My complaint with this book is that it is sooo dry to read. The NIV is a great example of a bible that was translated with both accuracy and beauty in mind. I'm not sure about the accuracy of this book, but the beauty has been thrown out the window. Just try it yourself. This bible is not a joy to read."
1,"A biased, deceptive, most dangerous book ever invented by man.","This entire translation was created to ""prove"" the doctrines of the Jehovah's Witnesses sect. Look at it this way, Charles Russell(the founder) had his crazy ideas when he started his cult in the late 1800s. After many, many false prophecies of impending Armageddon, the Watchtower needed a way to prove some of its lunatic proclamations because they were losing so many followers from year to year. Enter the New World Translation. Translated by a handful of people, which only one of them had 2 years worth of college in Greek and Hebrew - hardly enough to understand the ancient scriptures. So in 1950, they decided to invent a Bible which has absolutely no scholarly knowledge of the original text. Don't be deceived by this heretic translation, it will lead you down the path of destruction."
5,New World Translations Bible,I am very pleased with the New World Translation of the Bible. The book looked almost like it never been read. And the price was reasonable.
2,Too many contradictions!!!!!,"This ""Bible"" goes to show that the Jehovah Witness have false teachings in their cult! There are too many contradictions in their ""Bible."" I warn everyone to be very cautious with Jehovah Witness and don't be fooled by their false teachings."
5,Thank you Josef,"I read a few reviews saying that Jehovahs Witnesses will give you a bible for free, though that is absolutely true they no longer print them in paperback. They still have the deluxe. So thank you Josef, even though it should be free I was happy to find it. The seller is reliable and delivery was slow but what do you expect for USPS. I am very satisfied and the additional little something was an added treat."
1,Far more paraphrase than translation,"I have had the pleasure of spending time with Jehovah's Witnesses, but the displeasure of being introduced to this Bible version. Even at a casual glance I found that the verb knowledge in John 17:3 was translated as a noun! The use of Jehovah in the new testament is founded on Hebrew translations of the Bible beginning in the 14th century. Why ignore the reliable Greek scriptures that are from the 1st to 4th centuries that do not use Jehovah? Very biased with no real support. There are many other faults, but even without them, I simply found the verbiage to be awkward and simply not true to the Greek manuscripts claimed to be upheld."
2,NWT,I purchased this in order to better understand the JW sect. It was only a few bucks used and I figured why not. The book itself was as described however and quality was better than expected for cost.It's odd how so much of the Greek text has been changed and reworded. It takes only a small amount of knowledge of the Greek to find problems here. This particular edition most surely has been revised because it contains very obvious contradictions to the teachings of watchtower. I'm not even sure if the JW's will agree with this one but at least I'll have their bible to address issues with when they knock on my door.
1,Check the Accuracy of the Jehovah's Witnesses' Bible!,"I encourage anyone that really wants to know the claims of the Bible to use any translation OTHER than NWT. But don't take my word for it. Find an online translater from the Greek or Hebrew(from which all Bibles are based), which is easy to do and research scriptures like Hebrews 1:6, among numerous others. Then you form your own opinion about the accuracy of the NWT. IF this interpretation is indeed accurate, then there should be no deviances in meaning from the Greek or Hebrew!This item deserves 7 negative stars-promotes lies."
5,You received free...give free!,"That some people have placed this book FOR SALE on Amazon is a travesty, because it is available free of charge to ANY person of ANY religion who would like one. The Word of God is a gift to mankind,and yet many publishers have been selling Bibles at exorbitant prices for years. Jehovah's Witnesses donate the time, paper, ink, and shipping costs to make sure that every individual who wants to read the Bible can do so without cost. Can you imagine Jesus Christ asking for money for a copy of the book about the religion that He founded? Look up Kingdom Hall and/or Jehovah's Witnesses in the phone book, call them and ask for a copy delivered to your door. If you don't want to talk, just say so...we will respect your wishes and be glad that you got the Bible."
4,Great for the price,"These speakers sound great, especially when you factor in their size and price. My only complaint with them is that they really should have come up with a different speaker for the center channel. The satellite speakers work great for surround, but do not do the job when used as a center speaker, especially when mounted as directed which is pointing straight up. I remounted my center channel speaker so that it is pointing straight at the couch. This has helped a lot with understanding what people are saying, but when I get the time and money, I'm going to buy a proper center channel speaker. Overall, I am very happy with these speakers."
2,Surround system,"These speakers are well suited for a second set somewhere that is not the primary entertainment focus in your household. While many reviews categorize these as awesome, unbeliveable, etc., I found them far from high performance and miles away from any of the stellar reviews found here and elsewhere.Pros:Nice sizeEasy installationQuality designAttractiveBrackets includedReasonble size sub-woofer that is well poweredFlexible setup (based on your driver config)Cons:Performance is lackingSound resolution at various volumesDo not handle all types of music wellTo me, the cons heavily outweigh the pros in this case; and, if I had the chance to audition them before buying, I would have bought another product.Overall I would say, if you want to use these for a small scale setup in a guest room, or spare AV setup that is for the kids, these are great. If you are any kind of even semi-serious audiophile, or a music fan that knows music and enjoys a wide variety of listening, keep shopping."
2,"Informative, But Boring","I was only able to get through approximately 200 pages of this book. It is very informative and seems to be meticulously researched. However, it is also very boring. Its descriptions of even the most interesting events are dry and a chore to get through. Further, it does not follow Louis's life chronologically. Instead it covers his life by topics, e.g., The Dutch War, Life at Court, etc. I would certainly not recommend it for the casual reader."
3,Decent CD a few stand out tracks,3:33 is a decent record from a band who mix rock and music like ICP. The lyrics can be a little rough but the music is great. Fans of Zug Islands other CD's will enjoy this album.
3,Solid hard rock.,"I liked ZI's previous album ""Cracked Tiles"" and I think this may be better. I probably wouldn't have given much thought to Zug, as I generally don't listen to modern hard rock(I do like Guns'N'Roses and Alice Cooper). I am a hip-hop fan and a Juggalo, however, so I gave Zug the benefit of the doubt since they're with Insane Clown Posse's Psychopathic record label. In my opinion, what makes Zug unique is frontman Syn and his sandpaper, cigarrettes & coffee rasp of a voice. He can carry a tune better than many rockers on the radio and even when the lyrics become too self-important, he makes them worth listening to. Bottom line: If you're a Juggalo or you want an album that's loud and rocks hard, this is good stuff."
2,Boring,If your interested in the inner workings of trudeau this is not your book. The essays tend to drivel on and on.
2,The pictures save!,Very nice and emotionally pictures! But where is the text for these touching pictures?? It's a pitty!
3,Functional,"It does heat the entire 175 gallons of water, though I have to set the temperature SEVERAL degrees higher than the desired temperature. Meaning if I want water at 70F, i need to set the thermostat to 78F. I actually purchased 2 different Catalina heaters to compare the differences, and I much prefer the RF 1200 for my big tank."
4,Worked good,"Worked well to heat my 250gallon tank, but one of the two i bought barely lasted a year before it started leaking electricity into the water. I'm buying another one as it did do its job when it did work, and hoping it lasts a couple years this time."
5,Legendary Book,"I purchased this book when first published some 20 years ago and read it through about 5 times. It was inspirational and the book holds near legendary status amongst the type and design community. As does its author, who is now sadly passed away. If you have any interest in typography, this book is a must read."
4,This is Excellent Product for this rate,"Hi,I brought this product 5 months ago it is working in excellent condition. I had got no problem in using this product and also it is upto mark with other brands.If you are looking camcored for family functions, this is excellent camcored with required features.With me i told another 4 friends who had purchased, they had no problem in the use and also the product is excellent condition. This experince i am giving after use for 5 months."
2,you get what you pay for,"My first disappointment was that the camera is much bulkier in reality than it looks on all pictures on the net, so don't be fooled by the favorable angle used while making the shot of the camera. When you hold it feels cheap, according to the price. Vague VCR playback controls that also are controlling LCD menu navigation don't make the experience better. I give a credit for nice Canon lenses and killer 26-x optical zoom. Picture quality is OK, not more. I'd probably be satisfied with the overall package if the camera didn't start to garble the picture after 2 hours of use. I'm going to return it. Never trusted Sharp and likely never will..."
4,Great Camera,"This is a great digital camcorder. I took it to the Grand Canyon. The camcorder was able to record in freezing conditions with no problems. The battery lasted approximately one hour. I used the digital camera mode and I was able to take plenty of pictures, with the help of the 26X zoom lens. Overall, I'd say this is a great buy! Also, Amazon is the only store that I trust when I make important or general purchases on the internet. So lets keep buying and supporting this great online store! OR else we are going to have to buy from many not-so-reputable stores."
2,HOW TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE!,Well.... I've had the same problems as you guysplayback recording etc... well I got it from bestbuy online.and they recommended accessories as SONY miniDV tapes.Well... DON'T USE SONY with this camera!It broke mine. I brought it in service and they recommendedeither SHARP or Panasonic. To tell you the truth...I don't think you will have ANY luck finding sharp miniDVanywhere. Unless you work with them and have some for testing purposes heheheh. :) Well use Panasonic. I could not returnmine because 15 days trial period was over. So now I am usingPanasonic. :) Good luck people!
1,Nice Camara that does not work,"I do not recomend buying this camcorder. With my first tape it started to fail. The playback was garbled, the picture quality is terrible. Also, the service center was located 600+ miles away from Kansa City. I have see letters here from others having the same problem and suspect it's not just that I bought a lemon. Its been 4 weeks since I sent it in for repair and they are still waiting for parts..."
1,Don't buy it !!!,"I used to like Sharp before I bought this. I only used it 4 times for about 2 hours total. Still pictures at 1/2Megapixcels is not worth anything these days. From day one, playback sometimes broke up. After 6 months, all I got is 50% broken pictures, and I only playback 3 times. The quality isn't as good as VHS (go figure). I planned to make Dvd discs of my video and it's not worth the VHS tape. It only gets 3 months coverage on labor so I don't think it's worth anything to fix. Reliability [is terrible], picture quality [is terrible], even my VHS cam gets much better outcome without the broken pictures. It will be the last thing I buy from Sharp. I just threw [my money] out of the door, just like that."
4,"Don't be swayed by bad reviews, the camera works great!","I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews, having already ordered the camera, but not receiving it yet. But once I got it, I was able to charge it up and get it working very quickly and easily! I haven't had any tape problems (using TDK tapes) and all of my recordings and pictures are perfect! I gave it four stars instead of five because the menu is a little hard to navigate, and I had a little trouble with the power switch, but once I got used to it, it works great. Great price right now too."
1,Verry inconsisted performace,"The first camera I got started flashing the icon to clean the heads right the first time I used it. After cleaning the head I recorder about 55 minutes and when I tried to play back the video all I got was noise and a blue screen. I turned it off and after 20 minutes I tried to play the tape again and it played fine. I did another test again recording about 5o minutes and when I played back noise and blue screen again. I returned it for an exchange. The second camera suffered from the same symptoms, noise and blue screen after about 45-55 minutes of recording. Strange that after letting it off for about 15 minutes the tape played fine. This is not what I was expecting. I returned it also and will buy another brand"
1,to good to be true,"I strongly recomend not buying this camera. The one I purchased started to fail in two months. The playback was garbled and when it did work, the picture quality is terrible, defeating the purpose of a digital dv recorder. Also, the service center was located 300+ miles away. I live in Phoenix AZ, not the boonies. I have heard of others having the same problem and suspect it may be systemic. Spend the extra money, this one is to good to be true."
1,Don't waste your money,"Sharp's warranty stinks. They have 90 days on labor, 1 year on parts. But if you need parts after the 90 days, be prepared to fork over a [amount] labor fee! Plus, they only have one service center, in New York, so you have shipping fees, insurance fees for shipping it, and the [amount] return shipping fee that Sharp tacks on. Do it right the first time and spend the extra money to get a quality camera so you don't have to deal with this."
1,Don't buy it !!!,"I used to like Sharp before I bought this. I only used it 4 times for about 2 hours total. Still pictures at 1/2Megapixcels is not worth anything these days. From day one, playback sometimes broke up. After 6 months, all I got is 50% broken pictures, and I only playback 3 times. The quality isn't as good as VHS (go figure). I planned to make Dvd discs of my video and it's not worth the VHS tape. It only gets 3 months coverage on labor so I don't think it's worth anything to fix.Reliability [is terrible], picture quality [is terrible], even my VHS cam gets much better outcome without the broken pictures.It will be the last thing I buy from Sharp. I just threw [my money] out of the door, just like that."
4,Sharp VLWD450U Digital Camcorder,Its a good value for the kinda money you pay.I shud say better than anyother brand for the clarity and cost.
1,What's the deal with the playback problems?,"Yeah, just like everyone else, I'm getting the pixelated playback problems on my FIRST tape. If it weren't for that, this camera would be awesome. The nightvision recording is fantastic. I'm using TDK tapes. I'm going to return this camera like everyone else has. It's COMPLETELY USELESS without being able to use the playback!"
3,Something is wrong with this camcorder,I have it a few days. Features are great but picture qualitu islike mu 5 year old Panasonic analog camcorder. What can be the reason? If there is.
1,Don't Ignore the Reviews!!!,"Don't Ignore the Reviews!!! I read all the reviews about the problems with this camcorder. I figured that they were just a few cases. I ordered one -- and it had all the same problems that other people had stated (fuzzy sound, pixelization, dirty head). So, I asked Amazon for a new one. It came in the mail, and it had all the same problems. This WOULD have been a great camcorder (it has lots of cool features that I really liked, and a really easy to use menu system), but it doesn't work."
2,Distored playback,"I love this camcorder...ONLY if it works. Unless you want to take a chance because of the price (thats what i did), stay away from this camcorder. I worked for a few days. The playback function started NOT working. It became distored and garbled.I love all the features this camcorder has. I even bought a extra 64 smartmedia card for this camcorder. .....I just requested a return from Amazon. The UPS guys just picked it. Will see if i get the full refund or not. The nearest Sharp servie center is 175 mile away in NY, none in PA."
3,Pretty Good Camera,"I searched for months for the perfect video camera, and this was it. It has every feature I wanted except the external light, which isnt necessary since it can record very well with cats eye in total darkness. I never had a pixellation problem, and I used Panasonic miniDV tapes. I've had this camera for about 5 months, and just recently it started having a problem. When I put a tape in, it says ""Eject the Cassette"" and will not play or record a tape. ...Also, it would be nice if the camera were about half the size, and had microphone output."
1,wish it worked,"I'd really like to recommend this camcorder, but I can't. It has a lot of very good features at a great price, but the old addage, you get what you pay for applies here.The first one I had lasted a couple weeks. I only used it a couple hours when it started having problems playing back recorded video. First, random pixels all of the screen, then lines through the video, and finally it would not play back anything.So I returned that one and ordered another. While waiting for that one to arrive I found the reviews here and noticed simular problems listed. As soon as the new camcorder arrived and set it up on my desk and started play back and recording. Within 2 hours of use (just sitting on the desk) the camcorder would no longer play back anything. It just gives you a blue screen.Tech support has not answered my email request. This one is going back too, and I'm going to look for another brand."
4,Using iMovie with the Sharp VL-WD450U,"The Sharp VL-WD450U has a firewire port, but you need to go to the computer store to get the cable. I have a Mac with the iMovie editing software. Apple doesn't list the Sharp camera as one that is known to be compatible with the iMovie software. I plugged it in and it works fine.Also, the software that comes with the camera is PC Windows oriented, so I couldn't use it. But reading the still images onto your hard drive via a serial port is not a great idea anyway. I went down to the computer store and bought a nice little USB device that plugs into the keyboard USB port ... You insert the 8MB SmartMedia card into it and it acts like a floppy drive. Each image is a .jpg file. Just click on the image and it pops up on the screen.The camera is working fine so far. The 27X zoom is great. (Use a tripod) The only problem is finding a local source to buy a backup lithium battery. They don't sell them at the drug store or Wal-mart."
1,Bad warranty policy,My collar stopped working after 3 months. Innotek doesn't honor their warranty unless you buy from an authorized dealer (which doesn't include Amazon).
1,Beware Innotek,"Innotek tells me that Amazon is not one of their authorized dealers, so they will not honor any warranty. I bought one of their collars and it stopped working after two months. No warranty service if you don't buy from one of their authorized dealers."
4,Good price for a good prduct,"We have used the more expensive collars, and it is fairly comparable.May not have the ""extras"" that the more expensive ones have, but not really needed for one dog, and enough extras to suit your needs. Works well for my akita."
2,Questionable Remote Durability,"This ""training"" collar works relatively well if you are in line-of-sight, otherwise it's hit or miss ... and the 300-yard range that they claim is pretty ambitious. However, the major problem with this product is the durablity of the remote. I have owned this unit for about a year, and have nearly worn-out my second remote. The first remote was replaced by warranty (I bought it from another site).Filing a warranty claim was relatively easy and the replacement was sent within a week. However, the service rep I spoke with told me to keep all of the non-electronic components as back-ups for the entirely new unit they would be sending. It was a good thing that I did keep them, because they only returned the remote and unit."
4,Innotek ADV-300P,"Is the gray rubber plug necessary for the waterpoofing of the dog collar or is it just to keep dirt, etc. from entering. These are always lost in the woods or streams especially when the dog scratches herself. If they are necessary where can one buy these?"
4,"Same Album as ""Skyscrapers""","It is another fine Deodato album but may not have the funk and rhythms of Prelude, Deodato2, First Cuckoo, and some of the others. However it is worth mentioning that this album is almost impossible to find but for those who really want it can get ""Skyscrapers"" because it is exactly the same record. ""Os Catedraticos 73"" was the name used in Brazil but internationally the album was issued under the title ""Skyscapers"". The songs are all exactly the same and both albums have the same number of tracks."
4,Bossa Nova with brass and hammond keyboard sound,"I actually bought this album, thinking that it was by another Brazilian bossa nova artist, Joao Donato. When I realized my mistake I still wasn't disappointed. This cd is something I keep returning to every so often. The only way I can explain the music is like this: Imagine a hot summer day in Los Angeles in the mid-1970 when everyone is wearing sideburns and bellbottoms, and big hair. Then imagine driving your car down to Tijuanna and the groove is happening. Big brass and organ keyboards and samba. Bossa Nova..."
2,8000 Perfect Grade BB 0.12g Polished for Best Accuracy and Velocity,"Wish I had not ordered so many of these, as I hate the SIG Sauer P226 Spring Pistol airsoft gun. This was just a waste of money for both products."
5,Buen accesorio,indicado para usarse con el High Collection 1/16 Scale Custom Paint Radio Remote Control German Tiger I Tank Air Soft Rc Battle Tank Smoke & Sound ......cumple con las especificaciones
1,False item description,"They advertise 8000 perfect grade, polished bb's but, what you actually get is 2000 perfect grade, polished bb's in the plastic bottle and 6 bags of 1000 junk bb's with indents and plastic nubs sticking out. Not polished or perfect."
2,Uh bags?,"Ok for starters,if you think its ONE whole thing of bb's in a container,its not.actually,its 1 container of 2000 polished bb's in any color,i thought orange,and 6 bages of 1000 bb's.its weird.I dont know if the ones in the bag are polished.mine were entitled UK'BB's For electrict airsofting and gun.i think they didnt translate right.either way, i think you should just go to a near by Sports Authority or any orther convient store"
3,Not worth it,"These are cheap, Chinese .12g BB's. First, mine came in two different colors: the speedloader bottle came in yellow (2000) and the other 6k are UKarms BB's. Mine were blue (each bag was 1k, 6 bags) First, the BB's in the speedloader bottle are better. The are seamless, and polished. The bottle isn't well translated (0.12g Electricity Vapor Gun appropiantion 6mm BB bullets, Participate of tint 6 mm BB Bullets) but they work fine. However, the UKarms are terrible. They have craters, are seamed, and aren't polished. Spend the extra 3 dollars for 10k Crosman Camo Ammo. It's worth it."
5,great shipping time and quality!!!!!!!!,these came 2 days after i ordered them. they are very high quality. mine came blue and green though
1,Misleading,"I ordered over 30,000 bb's and none of them where like what the description said. Instead I ended up with 30,000 cheap yellow bbs that break in my AEG. My whole Airsoft team ordered some and all of them ended up with cheap bbs as well. Don't buy."
1,Had to cancel,"""Never got order. Had to cancel. They said address was wrong,but i had 3 other orders from different suppliers shipped to same address."""
1,Hot import toys NOT RECOMMENDED,I was very unhappy i got 4 bottels of low quality ukarms bbs they suck they are in no way polished they are low end bbs order good DO NOT ORDER THESE!!!!!!!!!!they jammed my spring pistol and i would never put them in any gun but a junker
2,Okay but break in half and chip,These are fast but inaccurate and break easily bet bigger and more accurate bb's
1,Not at all what was listed.,"I was fully expecting to get something like in the pistures. Nothing remotely close arrived. What arrived were a bunch of UKArms regular unpolished, BB's. You can cleary see where the BB's were taken off a lattice of some type when being maneufactured. I wouldn't put these BB's in my gun without first sanding down the little leftover plastic on each.I'm so mad about this, they basically lied about what you are ordering. DO NOT order these you will be highly disappointed, I wouldn't recommended ordering from this company if they are going to pull a switch like this either. I know I'll never buy from them again."
3,okay for springers,the shipping was great same day as listed on the estimated arrival but they are not completely polished and they are certainlly not perfect yet the product is the same as in the picturei give props mostly for a punctual arrival
3,lied to,"well these bbs are all florescent not white, black, or red there all yellow and i get alot of wind age with them"
5,They last forever!,"I love spring pistols and seriously, these last forever. Some seams on some BBs so don't put these in a tightbore 6.03 barrel. Then again, who uses .12g for AEGs? Your springers will love these though."
2,"""Perfect""? Yeah, right","I know that if I was looking for fantastic BB's, I should have spent more money on them. However, these BB's are barely functional. They jam up in my AEG and are only accurate to within 10-15 ft. So, yeah, I definitely would never use the words ""Perfect Grade"" to describe them."
2,low end,"these bbs are terrible in any aeg. first of all you should almost never buy .12 gram bbs. you should at least purchase .20 bbs or higher. Second, there is no way these are even remotely polished or seamless. These bbs or no where close to perfect. DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!"
2,These are bad,"DO NOT buy these if you have a mid-to high end airsoft gun (electric or gas run and cost $150+) Cyma is a ""clone"" brand, which means they design their products to imitate other higher-end brands, but with much cheaper and lower quality parts. Another problem is that these are .12 BB's. you should NEVER fire anything less than a .2 through any airsoft gun, as the lower weight not only makes it less accurate but can break the air seal on your gun, making it just about completely useless if you're planning on shooting things 15+ feet away or have any speed behind the BB.. .12g bb's will also put a lot more stress on your gun's internals, as there's not much weight to transfer energy to. I would suggest sinking an extra $5-10 on a higher-quailty brand, or at least buy some .2g BBs..."
3,Looks better than it cooks,"The pluses here are price and ease of assembly, even for me. The smoker has an outside heat guage that is convenient, if general: the settings are warm, ideal and hot. So, it's not a thermometer but useful enough.Some negatives have to include cheesy material and insecure fittings that result in any number of leaky spots, even along seams. The smoker has a vent, but you don't really need it because of the ill fitting parts. My biggest complaint, though, is the material itself, because the thing is so lightweight that cooking in a stiff enough wind might be an invitation to a conflgration.Ok, I guess, if you are an occasional enthusiast, but for those who are serious about outdoor cooking, skip this and step up and spend some money like I'm fixing to do."
2,Reads like a young adult book,"I am a big fan of historical fiction, especially those books that take place in ancient Rome. While this book tells an interesting story, the writing is a bit simple, almost like a young adult novel. If you're looking for a Roman mystery, stick with Steven Saylor."
3,OK but not his best work.,I have read several of Paul Doherty's historical mysteries and I have enjoyed them. This book fell a little short of the quality and readability of his other works.
5,My favorite movie of ALL times!,"A wonderful movie that shows us how our faith in God can inspire us to change our hears and lives! God moves in very precise, very specific ways...which is what I love about the ""accounting"" scene. Jay Austin Motors promos are just icing on a very delicious cake!"
5,Very good for all ages,"I really like the way they did this show it is a real life experience and I think good for all ages, it helps you really see the full picture of what our actions could lead to and how real God is."
4,Great Movie on a Low Budget,"I really like this movie despite its being made on a nearly zero budget. I will concede that many will find the story contrived and the acting substandard. Nevertheless, for me it is an enjoyable and uplifting story that lays a good foundation for their next movie, Facing the Giants."
5,The little movie that could,"This movie will strengthen the hearts of men to do what is right in spite of what the world demands. It teaches that we are to follow the Proverb which states: Trust in God with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding. Accept and follow God's guidance and he will direct where you should go (My paraphrase, read it from the source of all understanding in Proverbs 3: verses 5-6). This is a great family movie, as long as dad is watching with the family."
1,BAD DVD cannot watch it,i received this but it won't play in any dvd player because the dvd is bad. i am incredibly disappointed and have no idea how or even IF i can return it.
2,Should not be on Amazon,"Although we always welcome clean, family friendly movies with uplifting messages, a minimal standard of artistic quality is required to credibly convey any story. The screen writing and acting in this film was sufficient for small town community theater, but falls far short of a commercial feature length film. Come on Christians, we can do sooooo much better than this!"
3,Positive Message,"about righting wrongs. The writing is not bad, it's the performances that fall very short. It's obvious they had very limited time to rehearse and film. some of these scenes really should have been redone due to very bland and monotone delivery. The pregnant wife seems to have the most natural acting talent. The heavy set car salesman has the least. This is what happens when you cast your pal instead of the best actor in your church."
4,"Great storyline, above average acting, average video quality","This was a small budget film so it is not going to have the great sound and audio quality of a large studio film, but the story is a great one.This movie is very appropriate for children and adults. I had seen it as a rental and enjoyed it so much I purchased it.They have made another movie which is scheduled to hit theaters on September 26th, 2008 - FIREPROOF."
5,Great Movie,"This is a wonderful movie. It is refreshing to have movies that the entire family can watch together, without worries of inappropriate material. The movie also creates a good opportunity to talk about your faith. We also loved Facing the Giants and Fireproof. We are looking forward to The Grace Card. Thank you to all the people involved in bringing these movies to us."
5,Flywheel,Awesome movie. My entire family watched this movie. It was so great to be able to watch something that even my four-year-old could watch. It is refreshing to see a movie that shows people living their lives with God as a priority.
4,Engrossing and relevant journey of the heart,"Amazing to learn this gem was made on only about $20,000 budget with volunteer actors. I agree that due to film quality it has the cinematagraphy feel of a TV movie--but certainly no less than that. And at times the acting is slightly stiff, but at others is simply real-life, convincing, and extremely moving. You feel like you are peeking in on reality (and after all, ""reality TV"" is in).The storyline, however, is engrossing as you follow a corrupted Christian man on a spiritual journey and how that journey impacts others. Call it a ""morality tale"" if you wish, but it's a sophisticated and and very true to life one, somewhat like the Robert Duvall movie ""Tender Mercies.""Please don't deprive yourself of this film. This is the kind of film Hollywood should be making. And if the Kendrick brothers did this on a $20K budget, they are geniuses that stand up to any talent coming out of UCLA film school."
5,Excellent Message,A great movie with a valuable lesson. To those whose hearts are open to God you will receive a blessing.
3,"Good Message, Poor Film Quality.","Okay, the story line could get a better rating but the film quality was pretty bad. I've seen made for TV movies that were better. I am aware of the budget and original inteded audience though, so for that I have to give it a thumbs up still.The ending seemed to be played out a little too much. I thought the same thing about Fireproof too. He made good with God and his family, so did we really need the scene with the reporter at the end?"
4,FLYWHEEL,I was really entertained by the movie Flywheel. It seemed to me to be a down to Earth movie which taught a great value lesson. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who believes in having a conscience mind of honesty and having faith that there is still humans out there who want to live the way we are supposed to do.
4,Better than Hollywood's current crop,"If you are tired of the gratuitous sex scenes and filthy language of most Hollywood productions these days, try this out. These brothers are just getting started in the film industry, but each production is better than the one before. If we put our dollars behind good movies, they will continue to grow in quality and themes."
4,Not a bad first effort...,"Considering the entire movie was filmed using an all volunteer cast and crew and a $20,000 budget ($15,000 of which went to pay for camera equipment). It is well acted, and the story is well written and well told. It does not get boring and holds the viewers attention from beginning to end. The bonus features are worth the price of the DVD. The lessons learned from the filming of this movie were applied very well to the subsequent films made by this same church, including Fireproof, Facing the Giants and Courageous.I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a good family movie with an uplifting message."
4,Faith Builder,This was a wonderful written movie. Don't over bearing and pushing religion on the unsaved. It will cause any unbeliever to rethink their relationship with the Almighty Savior.Flywheel (Director's Cut)
5,enjoyed,"I liked this movie & would recommend this for all families to watch. faith based, good for all ages. Have shared it with my family & friends."
4,Great message,"I originally saw this movie on TBN and I had to buy it because I love supporting christian projects. While the acting is off (no paid professional actors) and the quality of the film is low budget (no funding from a major film company), the message is wonderful. Take into consideration that they made this film on their own using members of the church and the help of the community, this is a good movie. And with each movie, they got better. It's not only an inspiring message on screen but the off screen message says that when we work together as a church and as a community we can change people. It shows a man being a man but yielding to God and that's what we need more of. You almost feel the real pain of Jay Austin in some scenes which Alex Kendrick brings to life. I am a huge fan of the Kendrick brothers and Sherwood Pictures. We need more of these types of movies to help teach us practical ways to live out the christian faith."
3,One Major Flaw And It's Theology,"Flywheel is the first major film released by the creators of Facing the Giants and Fireproof.This church down in Georgia has a pair of brothers who enjoy making positive faith-based films.In Flywheel, Jay Austin is a used car salesman who will do anything to make a profit on selling cars. And because of that, his life is turning to trash.Once he turns his life over to Jesus, and changes his business habits, things start looking brighter.You can tell this film was made a while ago. And the technology used wasn't up to par with the rest of major motion pictures. The acting is a little stale and the message is a little skewed...As with Facing the Giants, we're taught that if we just give our life to Jesus, we'll get everything we've ever wanted. Everything will be amazing from then on out.This is so far from the truth. Giving your heart and life to Jesus will not make you rich."
5,Thoroughly excellent and thought provolking - including production values!,"This film should be seen by all - often. Like ""Facing the Giants"", it is a look at how we often attempt to plan and direct our own lives but, as is written in the book of Jeremiah:""O Lord, I know it is not within the power of man to map his life and plan his course-- so you correct me, Lord; but please be gentle. Don't do it in your anger, for I would die. Jer 10:23-24 (TLB). Enjoy..."
4,Flywheel Surprise,"This was a lot better than I expected! It's the first of three films produced by a small church in Georgia. The story makes sense and flows well. A car-dealership owner has a history of cheating customers to make a profit and he trains his two salesmen to do the same. After he accepts Jesus as his Savior, he realizes he can't do that any more. He's faced with foreclosure and his two salesmen quit. How the Lord helps him is a real encouragement. One black woman who he cheated and tries to make amends to steals the show in the last part of the movie. Great story!!"
4,Awesome!,"Shipped regular came express, especially for the time of year!The movie is a wonderful inspiration to those who are relying just upon their own decisions on where to turn and what can happen when they do! A must see for those who are fence sitters and not sure how to get off the fence to make sure their lives are going to go in a right direction.Camera angles can be noticed in this movie but for a beginning director's movie, very well done!"
5,"A $20,000 Movie?",I have seen worse movies that took a lot more money to make. What a great starting point for this group of people from church to make such a wonderful movie. It is well worth the time to watch; without any dead spots in the story. These people did a great job.
4,"A good compliment to ""Facing the Giants""","The movie was enjoyable, and certainly along the same lines as ""Facing the Giants"" as far as a faith-building movie and a reminder that God can and still does work miracles. Execs at AIG, Wall Street, and any business owner should watch this movie. Non-believers may be skeptical about some of the events that take place when the main character decides to give control over to God on his business, but believers will be able to relate."
2,"God is fair, but not the Fairy Godmother","Salve-God-oola-menchicka-boo-la Bibble-di-bobbidi-booLet's pray together and what have we got?Bibble-di-bobbidi-booSalve-God-oola-menchicka-boo-la Bibble-di-bobbidi-booHe won't do magic, believe it or notBibble-di-bobbidi-booNow God will be there for you, whenever you ask Him to,But you've gotta move your arse as well toBibbidi-bobbidi-boo!Salve-God-oola-thanksalot-too-la Bibble-di-bobbidi-booGod's got more serious things to do thanBibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!"
5,Excellent movie,"This is a very inspirational movie - the first one that a church put together that also produced ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fireproof"". It talks about living for God in everything we do and the consequences of that. The director's cut helped the sound and color so it's easy to watch. I highly recommend it."
5,An amzing true story! A must see movie!,"Flywheel is a true story about a man not making good life choices. An incredible story about God and the power of love and family and that goodness prevails. It will make you laugh and cry. A must see, good for all ages."
4,See my review on Facing the Giants,"See my review on Facing the Giants - though this movie is less polished (hence my 4 rather than 5 stars), the general observations / recommendations are the same!"
5,movie,great price and fast shipping. my daughter gave me a list of movies she wanted. this was so much easier than going to look in stores for each movies. thanks
4,Flywheel Flies!,"Although an early attempt at movie making left some areas of the film a bit choppy, in other ways the choppiness made the film seem more real. The story line was excellent. My family thoroughly enjoyed Flywheel. Our son has asked to watch it again, which is evidence that it's a winner."
3,Food for Thought,"I liked this movie. It is NOT a Hollywood blockbuster. In fact, it is kind of hokey. HOWEVER, if you watch this LOW budget film for what it is (Food for Thought) you will walk away with a good feeling and find yourself looking at how you handle your daily life. This is a Christian film and I am a Christian, but if you are not a Christian you can still walk away with food for thought on how you conduct yourself in the daily grind of life. I gave it only 3 stars because of the quality, the obvious low budget and script/acting - but loved the content!"
5,Flywheel,Love this movie and all that have been made by The Kendrick brothers. They are educational and heartfelt. I wish that church was near my home. I'd love to attend the services if his messages are as touching as his films!
4,Well done and amazing for the budget this picture had!,"A refreshing movie that you will want to share with your kids and friends. This movie while not a blockbuster gives you the same good feeling as the successful, ""Pay It Forward."" I hope this group continues to be successful in making wholesome movies that have a positive message."
1,Terrible,"I saw it in the supermarket for $6, so I thought 'hey, it's got Deniro in it, so it can't be that bad'. It was that bad. It's old, unclear, and a terrible movie. Deniro is not even the main actor. Stupid plot, lousy acting, and a horrendeous ending. Don't waste your time and/or money!"
3,Halfway decent pirate romance,"I am not going to go into detail, I see this has already been done. This book had a really good story, I was not impressed with the level of passion and need reflected in the writing and the sex was not all that either. I do not recommend this book if you are looking for a scorching romance. However, if you are an avid pirate romance reader check this one out."
4,Beautiful story!!!!,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Jeffries. Haven't read all her books yet, but I am working on it.So far she hasn't missed the mark once. At times this story tends to get a bit draggy, but it does pick right up.I did enjoy ""The forbidden Lord"" which is the next book in the series a bit more.Still a wonderful read!!!"
1,I was so bored,"I normally agree with the reviews that books get on Amazon. But this book was so boring the heroine complained too much, I didn't see what could possibly be considered romantic. Also the concept was too bizarre even for a book. I put the book down several times finally I reached the point were I couldn't read one more sentence. Please don't waste your money on this book get it from the library."
5,"Shiver me timbers, a great story!","Aye,... and what a great story it is! Especially the final chapters, I was floored by the outcome. It was so poignant that I could actually visualize it in my mind's eye. It blew me away! I do not want to give the plot away, but what I will say is this: Gideon, the hero's, back story should not be taken at face value. Great chemistry between the main characters, the secondary characters were memorable too."
3,Great Author - is a re-release from 1998,"This is a re-release from 1998 and over all this author is amazing writer and I hadn't read this one before but I got to the last few chapters and thought I know HOW this will end I don't care to finish it. I did finish it after a few days on my shelf and over it was OK.This story is a strong-willed women heads out of female convict ship uncover how poorly the women are treated and attempt to bring to this to light back in England. While on the ship a famous Pirate Captain Horn kidnaps the women and takes them all her his private island to have them marry his men....If you are looking for some excellent novelsfrom his author check out these series;A Dangerous Love (Swanlea Spinsters, Book 1),In the Prince's Bed (Royal Brotherhood)andNever Seduce a Scoundrel (The School for Heiresses, Book 1)."
3,He Should Have Stayed At Sea,"A pirate captain with a crew of pirates looking to give up their wayward life and settle down; a ship of female convicts bound for Australia and shepherded by a crusading English lady; a not-so-bright idea by said pirate captain of capturing the female convicts and providing brides for his crew - all together a recipe for disaster. Or so some would think.I enjoyed this story for its escapism mostly. I didn't find it overly romantic in spite of the fact that said Captain Horn spent a lot of his time shirtless. It seemed strange to me that any pirate, even one trying to woo a female convict, would put aside his gruff ways and court said female convict(s). The heroine, Miss Sara Willis, was a bit too demanding for my tastes. She seemed to keep wanting more and more concessions before she would acquiese to the Captain.A nice change of pace, though, from the usual swashbuckler or Regency period romance."
3,For most of the book it just dragged!,I love Sabrina Jeffries and thought the Forbidden Lord was one of the best books ever -- really expected to like this one too. But even Jordan was totally annoying in Pirate Lord. Sara was way too high and mighty to actually find warm and captivating and I have no idea why Gideon claimed to be so taken with her from the very beginning?? Gideon was the most boring pirate ever and nothing like the rogues and rakes that usually epitomize true pirates. The plot dragged for much of the book - I actually picked up and began another book while reading this - which I never ever do. The book did get better more than 2/3 of the way through which allowed me to finish. And I would have to say that the twist of the plot at the end was a rater saving for me and I did find myself loving the end and totally tearing up!! I see that most have rated this book very high - although the few that rated it lower seem to share my opinion of it being a very slow moving dry book!
3,cute romance,"Pirate Lord didn't live up to it's reviews. This does not read like a pirate story that follows the alpha male pirate kidnaping thing - rather, a lighter than light (boderline boring), bring her to a remote island thing. We'll eat banannas and live happily ever after. Cute, and thanks to the scene where he baths himself (hold me back) this wasn't completely flat. The couple had sexy vibes they didn't do enough with. I don't think I'll be hunting down the others in the series."
5,"My first Sabrina Jeffries book, it won't be my last, either!","This book is PERFECT, or extremely close to it. I've been reading romances since September of 2004, and this would be in my top 5 so far.This book had everything you could possibly want in a romance.It sure did not seem like a first time book for an author, it seemed very well seasoned.The cover is beckoning, but don't buy the book on that premise alone. The characters are all well drawn & even the ones not soloveable have their pluses.In addition to liking the main characters, I also liked some ofthe sideline romances. Even though Petey & Ann were cute together, my favorite sideline couple had to be Salinas & Louisa.They started out together, for convenience purposes, but found out each was capable of more than they had originally bargained for.There isn't much I can say here that other reviewers haven't already said, but I mean it when I say this must be among thegreatest romance novels of all time."
3,Too fairy tale,I bought this book after I read some of the other reader's comments about it. I was disappointed. It starts out very promising but then slides downhill. The ending was a bit much for me to believe. In fact I found this book to be too fairy tale like for my tastes. If you like books that are 'oh-so sweet' then this book is for you. I doubt that I'll be buying anymore of Ms. Jeffries books.
5,Arrrrrrg,"This man is seductive and handsome, so much so that any woman would wish he were real. This story along with the other's in the series are amazing and heart stopping."
5,Information on Biblically Responsible Investing from an industry insider,"I liked this author's style of writing, with the mixture of facts, anecdotes, and faith. Entertaining reading, and useful for understanding the differences between socially responsible investing (SRI) and value-based investing (VBI)."
3,very retro md,"my granddaughter had rented this from the library and wants to be a doctor (you go girl), so she loves it, and doesn't consider it old..."
3,Secrets,"A different look at life from a disadvantaged and hard done by child , but a strong girl who is a survivor"
3,One of her better books,"I enjoyed this but as usual with Lesley Pearse, I felt the story dragged and 100 pages less would have worked better.Light, undemanding reading with no surprises."
2,Buy the other version -- the Tai Seng release,"I would like to give this version 5 stars, i love the movie, but this is the Dimension release which only offers an English language dub. If that's OK by you, then this is the cheaper version, but if you are a purist like me, you'll want the Cantonese/Mandarin version with English subtitles."
2,BEWARE THE SUBTITLES,"OK, the cover to my DVD is slightly different from the one picture on amazon, but I imagine that this is the same release. THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE AWFUL! Yeah, dubbed versions of Hong Kong crime are bad, but at least you can follow the action. The English subtitles are godawful- broken english, badly timed, often confusing, and it gives me the feeling that I'm missing half of the movie. My recommendation is to rent a dubbed copy of this film before seeing the subtitled version. That way, you'll know what's going on, and be able to enjoy the film as it was intended. I give the DVD 2 stars only for the subtitles- it is a beautiful adaptation to DVD from an image perspective..."
1,Do not buy this dubbed edition,The information available in one of the reviews (referring to the better subtitling in the Disney edition) is incorrect. This editon only has the dubbed English language sound track. What a waste.
1,Fun film-awful DVD!,"The one-star is for the hack job presented on the DVD not the film itself. We get a nice enough looking anamorphic transfer, but with an awful 5.1 English dub, completely new titles and music, and no original dialogue. If you want to see this film you're best off to track down a foreign edition. This is just painful to watch."
4,Still better than Reservoir Dogs,"""City on Fire"" far and away is much better than Tarantino's movie ""Reservoir Dogs"". City on Fire is not like any of Chow Yun-Fat's other movies in that it contains less gun play and less violence. But one thing that is intact is the great story. This is one of the best undercover cop stories there are and no American film company could do it better, they could only copy it like Tarantino. As said before, Yun-Fat is an undercover cop who must bust thieves who are going to pull a big job. One of the thieves is Danny Lee from the Chow Yun-Fat movie ""The Killer."" If you want to see a smart action film then you must get this one because it actually makes sense."
3,Get the version in the ORIGINAL CHINESE,"Technically, great. I love this film. But, I HATE the English dubbing. I still find myself watching the VHS version. No one has so far managed to translate the inflections, and emotions, of a language, once they dub it..."
4,good film...,"this movie is most notable for being ripped off by quentin tarantino when he made 'his' film reservoir dogs. quentin=hack. this movie is much better, but don't watch it if you like reservoir dogs or quentin tarantino because you'll never view him or the movie the same way again."
3,city on fire....,"city on fire........this movie inspired Tarantino's Resvoir Dogs...but honestly i don't see how that happened. this movie was not as good as the killer or hard-boiled.Movie starts at a stree market of Honh Kong, an undercover cop is killed by some Triad when they discovred that he's a cop.Inspector Lau,(plays Chow YunFat's Uncle) wants Ko Chow(Chow Yun Fat) to finish the job.Chow Yun Fat was not as slick or genius in this movie copare to his other movies. there a scene where he;s buck naked.Action was horrible,there are only 2 actual shoot outs,one scene i say is genius is the scene where gangs point guns at each other not knowin who to trust....that scene was awesome....but the movie...ehhh... not so great.i recommend watchin better tomorrow, god of gamblers, the killer."
4,Great throwing axe,"I bought two of these on amazon.com because theyre like $20 cheaper (each) than if you order them off the Sog website. I gave one as a gift to a friend and kept one for myself. So when I got it in the mail, the first thing I noticed was how nice it felt. Just the overall quality was great but I was disappointed to find out the handle isn't made of wood like I read in another review. Its made of fiberglass and after a couple of throws the handle broke. Same thing happened to my friends. You can still throw it because the actual handle is steel but just the fiberglass grips cracked. Other than that I'm pretty happy with my purchase. Its easy to throw and gets stuck almost every single time and I'm no pro."
1,It broke!!,This item broke after only a few uses. And now I can't figure out how to return it. That doesn't seem quite right. :(
5,An Excellent Daily Devotional,"Praying with the Psalms is an excellent way to start the day! Eugene Peterson addresses the major issues of life and our relationship to the everfaithful and loving God through thought-provoking meditations and heartfelt prayers. This is a book I would recommend to anyone who would like to get to know God better but has trouble with the discipline of daily Bible reading. The daily readings don't take long, yet within one year all of the 150 Psalms are covered. Throughout the generations the Psalms have always been considered a place where one is able to clearly see the heart of God. Praying with the Psalms helps us in this endeavor. It is also a good book to give as a gift to a friend or a loved one."
2,dougv,"Psalms are wonderful to help you pray. They tell more about God (His characteristics and what He'll do for you) than anywhere in the Bible.I expected a lot when I read the reviews and saw the title.Unfortunately, the prayers don't touch the heart of someone who's close to God and committed to Him.Finally, the comments about the verses don't say much.I don't recommend this book. A far better book is Each New Day by Corrie Ten Boom. She has so much to say after enduring a Naziconcentration camp and having her family killed there. Do check out her other books. She has a wonderful way of saying much thattouches deeply you in a few words. I've read many of her books."
1,ARIA - Classic Lost....,"ARIA is a wonderful film. Each director chose an Operatic Aria to work with for interpretation to the screen.The new DVD release is to be avoided. I pre-ordered this a couple of months ago and upon arrival, was totally dissapointed by the quality. It's not 16x9 as advertised. It's not even full frame as it was filmed. Very poor transfer from an old answer or release print. Poor sound, doesn't even look good with a 1080 upconvert DVD player.I have this film on VHS tape. Three years ago I transfered it to DVD. My VHS tape copy is far superior to this release.In short, it sucks......."
1,Another Bad Anthology Film,"If you don't like opera, ""Aria"" will not appeal to you. If you love opera, ""Aria"" will not appeal to you. I had been warned about this anthology film, but wanted to see it for the Robert Altman segment. Out of respect for the great director, I'll just say that his segment is no better or worse than any of the dreck that surrounds it. The movie is pretentious and dull, almost unwatchable save for Franc Roddam's interesting Las Vegas episode."
1,Horrible!,"Most of these little ""stories"" are poorly done and just make little sense. There is no imagination here. This has all been done much better many times before with more intelligence. Spend your money on something better."
2,Maybe I'm missing something????,"just watched this movie twice through....maybe I am missing something, but I did not like most of it.....I would say that I sort of hated it, with the following exceptions....the music was nice, therefore I gave it the 2 stars.....I thought the two best vignettes were: die tote stadt; scenery inside and out was very good, but not the actors, the music was nice, and depuis le jour; scenery again, plus actors and music)....didn't care for the liebestod segment with bridget fonda...thought it was gruesome...I did like the one with the kids in it, la virgine degli angeli (music and the photography was interesting)...the rest of the segments I did not care for and would probably not watch this again."
2,This film is not a movie...,"but a series of different opera parts with a short film trying to represent each part. Each chapter has nothing to do with the rest, leaving a feeling of total disconnection. The actors try to move their mouths as if they were singing but again the disconnection is totally evident, it seems it was done on purpose, but not sure why. Elizabeth Hurley is not the british model/actress Liz Hurley so don't be confused."
4,I couldn't get it right,"This was the first flavor I attempted making lollipops with and I couldn't get it right. I burned the sugar, or I would add too much or too little oil. So I can't say whether it was the oil or me, but I didn't LOVE it."
4,Works great!,"The smoker was easy to assemble. Went together without much problem. It worked well and did a great job of smoking a chicken! Well worth the $ for home smoking. Would be nice if the ashes could be cleaned out without having to unscrew heating element - but, not a big hassle."
1,Piece of CRAP... Don't buy it!,"Cheap workmanship but i was willing to live with that. It worked ok the first 3 or 4 times. The owners manual did say to put the thermostat to HIGH as a general cooking tip, this should have been a clue. After 3 or 4 uses i found it was taking longer and longer to smoke whatever i put in the thing. At this point I don't think the thing is generating 150deg and as i am writing my family is starving while waiting for the ribs to finally become somewhat tender. I live in the Bahamas so outside temp. is not an issue, in fact i think if i were to remove the top my family would be enjoying our ribs sooner.I can't tell you what to buy, but I CAN tell you don't buy this piece of Crap."
1,"Great Smoker, Just Doesn't Hold Up","I have had 2 of these smokers within the past 2.5 years. On both units, the adjustable power source broke within 1.5 years of purchase. On the first unit, the heating element that attaches to the power source was also ruined.The warrantee was 12 months from the date of purchase, and no luck with the manufacturer after that period (I called). 50 dollars to replace the broken parts. I bought another unit instead, just 13 months after that, the adjustable power source has broken again. This unit was kept under a cover, indoors, when not in use.I love the ease of use of this smoker, and the final product it produces, it just doesn't hold up."
3,Fair weather smoker,"Wasn't too hard to assemble. Body was manufactured a little tweeked, the top dome has to be on just right or there is a gap. It does a pretty good job. I've smoked salmon, pork spare ribs and a tri tip (not at same time). The heat element isn't very powerful so if it's cold or windy it's hard to maintain 225 degrees. That said, when it's warm outside it works well. I like the fact that being electric you don't have to add fuel. It cleans up pretty easily too."
4,Meco Grill/Smoker,I successfully have smoked a variety of meats with this smoker. I had issues at first but got an immediate reply from Meco customer service which solved my problem. Be very sure that the extension cord you use is of the proper amperage.
2,Electric Element,"This was easy and fun to assemble and the finished product is impressive, however, the electric element does not heat up (when the element control is plugged in) the red light on the control lights up, but no heat.I am thinking about having an electrician look at it, otherwise I'll return it. Any suggestions?"
2,Ok but would not buy again.....,Smoker came missing parts however after faxing in all paperwork to prove purchase they sent missing items out and received in a couple days. Real issue with the smoker is that it does not hold heat well. Took double the recommended time to cook. I have stopped using after a couple trys and now plan to sell at garage sale in the spring.I am disappointed with the product and would not recommend it if you decide to buy buy with low expextatations. The service with the seller was good and fast. I would work with this seller again..
1,Junk!,Total wast of money. Will not heat up enough to cook anything unless you plan to cook it over the course of three to four days. Because the heating element it soo cheap and the fit of the rest of the smoker is loose - it will not hold even enough heat to generate smoke. The design of having a smoking pan at the bottom that is also the base for the heating element just does not work. It even has a hole in the middle of the smoking pan for ???What??? I dont know. Its a water smoker and has a water pan between the element and the meat - so it cant be for a drip cup. Just an all around aweful thing. I went out to Lowes and bought a Brinkman $89 electric water smoker that does a MUCH better job. Amazon should not even sell these as they really are not fit for use. Total garbage and now in the garbage!
3,I had higher expectations,"Like others I purchased this smoker based on the Cooks Illustrated review. Some observations after smoking a turkey. The owners manual is poor. It gives cooking instructions for charcoal. That's important because the promise with an electric smoker is to set the thermostat and it will maintain a constant temperature. Unfortunately, the manual doesn't help.No problem, I turned it up as high as it would go and put a thermometer in the hole at the top. Well, it got hot enough for ribs or pork shoulder but not hot enough for a turkey. It then began to rain and the cooking temperature dropped way too much for comfort, so I ended up removing it from the smoker and putting it in the oven for the last 30 minutes. I'm not sure why the thermostat wouldn't allow the element to get any hotter but it is a little disappointing. I am going to try ribs tomorrow and see how that goes."
1,I'm returning this smoker today,"I'm returning this smoker today. After 3 hours, it wasn't able to get up to 200 degrees. Poorly designed, poorly executed."
2,What you see is not what you get.,"I bought this smoker because I did research on it on web and it is supposed to be one of the better ones on the market.Meco Model 5030 Electric Grill and Combination Water SmokerWhen I got my shipment and started the assembly the instructions were either vague or skipped over. The barrel was elongated, the lid does not fit well,(I have to bang on it to close it), the manufacturer incorrectly installed the pop rivets. The Temperature gage was way off.Would I buy this again? In a word ... NO!"
2,Faulty Rheostat Design,"I have had this smoker for 8 years. The tank and operation is convenient and does a good job smoking food. The electric element however, i.e., the rheostat that plugs into the heating coil, burns out every two years and it costs me $50 to replace it. I have gone through four of them. You would think they could design one that holds up. Anyway, that's enough for me. I'm going to another brand."
1,Quality control stinks,"The first shipment arrived missing the heating element. The replacement arrived with a damaged bowl. Fortunately I had not yet returned the first one so I managed to cobble one together by combining parts. Assembling was not too bad, given that the manual did not have step by step pictures but only a picture of the overall assembly.I really can't comment on the smoker's performance yet as I have only used it once. At least it didn't blow a fuse and given the poor quality control exhibited I had my doubts about that.I will probably keep it unless it fails to perform correctly but I cannot recommend anyone purchase it given the quality control issues."
1,"Very poor quality, cheep junk!",This unit is very poorly made of cheep flimsy materials. The top doesn't properly fit the body of the smoker so it does not hold heat or smoke. I would strongly urge anyone to consider a different smoker of better quality. I was enticed by the low price. I paid $69.95 and that was way too much. I absolutely do NOT recommend this smoker.
4,Smoker is very productive,"This smoker was a purchase I made after my last smoker died.The smoker holds a lot of meat to be smoked.I have smoked Salmon and Ribs. Both come out well with good smoked flavor.While four stars is a good rating, it means I would like a few changes in the smoker if I could.1;Would prefer that there was a wood chip pan on top of the coils. At times it can be tough to get the wood to burn due to the wood lays ""beside"" the coils.2: No auto-shut off. I prefer some type of auto shut off, helpful for loading the smoker and if anything happens, your meat will smoke but not burn up. Some times I like to load the smoker with meat and chips, then go to bed. With no auto shut off, that is not a option.The above are minor, I still give 4 stars"
3,"Works OK, construction pretty flimsy","Had to be reshipped, as first one was so out of round it couldn't be fit together. The real trick to cooking is marinate or brine and smoke..makes succulent chicken and perfectly done beef. Internal thermometer would help."
3,Grill smoker,"The unit could seal better, and it came a little banged up. However the metal was weak enough to reshape it back to near its original form. The lack of the lid sealing well can be rectified by putting a space blanket over it.. I've only used it as a smoker, and it did an okay job. I don't know if the more expensive ones are better made, but this one does an adequate job for the price. Jim Marshall"
5,This is a MUST for any library!,"I am a retired teacher. I retired early (age 25) to stay home with my first baby when she was born in 1989. We now have three children who love to read. I love children's literature and this book interested me. It interested me because entangled in the pages are history, family, friendship, devotion, loyalty and patriotism. The author had me glued to the pages and I, literally, did not put the book down until I finished it! She made the main character so real and I was cheering her on, feeling her pain, and could remember being a little sister to a big brother whom I loved and adored. My daughter is reading the book now - it is beside her bed. These are the kinds of books that I loved as a child and love passing down to my children. It's a wonderful book. I hope the author is inspired to continue to write more children's books. She has a gift and we are fortunate that she shared her gift with us, the gift of writing."
4,took some getting used to,"This is my second camcorder, and it did take some getting used to. I guess I was used to my older one, even more so than I thought. Once I played around with this camcorder for a couple hours I got the hang of it and started to really enjoy it! I love the photo shot effect, as well as the fact that I can shoot in black and white. At first, I missed my old camcorder, but now I love this one!"
2,"Returned, too big. Have NOT gotten my refund yet.","Great shorts, but I needed to get a smaller size, so I returned it. Several weeks later now, I have NOT received my refund."
1,Naxos Audiobooks did a terrible job,"Naxos Audiobooks should not be allowed to create this type of product. The abridged version of The Brothers Karamazov is an unethical, unacceptable, and simply evil joke that will kill any interest in Dostoevsky's novel. My advice, pick up a real book, full version and enjoy this outstanding novel.Naxos Audiobooks went as far as putting a portrait of a famous Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko on the cover of this CD. I would like to know what does Taras Shevchenko have to do with the Brothers Karamazov? Any educated individual will laugh at this publisher's stupidity and absolute lack of knowledge of both Russian and Ukrainian literary heritage. What disrespect to Russian and Ukrainian cultures! Before trying to make money on using those authors, they ought to at least make a basic research... Outrageous!"
4,The Wordsworth edition is NOT the Avsey translation!,"Based on one or more of the reviews, I ordered the Wordsworth edition of The Brothers Karamasov thinking that it must be the Avsey translation the review raved about. It's not. It's is the old Constance Garnett translation. Avsey's translation is available through Amazon, but this is not it. What happens is that the reviews for the Wordsworth edition and the Oxford Press edition get mixed together. The Amazon page for the Wordsworth edition does not mention who the translator is, so I guess it's my fault for being taken in by the review. Careless shoppers, beware. If you Amazon booksearch for Ignat Avsey, his translation of the novel turns up. Spend a few dollars extra for a book you're going to spend some serious time with!"
1,Taras Shevchenko on the Brothers Karamazov' CD???,"Those Naxos Audiobooks should have paid more to those who did the cover of the CD. Why did they put a portrait of a famous Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko there ??? They have nothing to do with each other. I think the Naxos just liked the portrait, which is, btw, is a very famous one. I think it is just publisher's stupidity and ignorance of the Slavic heritage. Totally unacceptable!"
3,Assumes teens have the attention span of a peanut,"Although the information in this video is good and the style engaging, I was dissapointed with the way it talked down to students. Several times one of the performers says something to the effect of ""Don't worry -- we'll give you plenty of examples to explain it."" My 9th grade students prefer to be treated like adults when discussing complex topics like symbolic art. It is also just a little too ""fast-paced."""
1,Will be waiting for Region 2,"Not really a review, but I have purchased both Season 1 & 2 in this excellent series from Amazon.com, BUT if they are switching to double sided ""flipper"" discs for Columbo, I will wait for the Region 2 release in the UK. A bit longer to wait I know, but at least the British market has wised up and know that the customers there will NOT put up with substandard quality releases. The public refused accepting these flippers a long time ago. Make your voice count with your wallets."
3,worth watching once,"worth watching once, but as we were great fans when originally aired, these shows do not merit repeated watching.Get real tired of the dumb approach of Colombo, only to turn around as Einstein in the end."
3,"Good movies, bad media",It's was shipped within a week of purchase.Columbo has been my favorite.There are two disks dual site in the box. Disk 1 site2 is defect.
1,"I love Columbo, But the DVDs are terrible!","I love Columbo, but I hate when DVD companies cheaply make DVD sets and do nothing about it.I bought my first copy and Candidate for Crime froze and was unwatchable. Then my second copy did the same thing and also the third. Finally I went on Amazon U.K and Season three and It worked perfectly. The U.S copy is on 2 double sided discs, the region 2 version is on four discs. In my opinion if you have a region free DVD player, go with it."
5,X-mas Present for friend,I bought this for my roommate for Christmas; he already has the Complete First Season. He enjoys these episodes immensely.
1,Double-Sided DVDs - watch out,"I agree with previous posters about this set not playing. I am unable to get through a single episode. These double-sided DVDs should be illegal. I don't think I've ever gotten a series with double-sided DVDs that I've not had to return to the store several times. Luckily for the Columbo series, this third season is the only one that's double-sided. It's a shame because it's a great season. If I could PLAY the DVDs, I'd give this set a 5. If you got this set and it didn't work, please write to Universal about it."
2,Columbo season 3,"This was not very good. The dvd's were skipping and the sound track did not match up very well. I was not happy with this set, but I like Columbo so much will keep it."
2,Discs Hang,"These are on two-sided discs. One disc had a side that would not complete the play of the movies. It would come to a point and then hang. No visible defects on the disc, so I assume that it was not properly burned."
2,DVDs are inferior quality,"The shows on the third season are great. My low rating is because the double sided DVDs don't play right. They skip, stop and malfunction. This was the only season that was issued on double sided discs -- as others have mentioned in their reviews. I suggest that single sided discs of better quality be manufactured and sent to all buyers of this set."
1,A Monument to the Idiocy of Entertainment Corporations,"My enthusiasm for the opportunity to finally own season 3 of this fine show was more than equaled by my disappointment and anger when it arrived. Not only did the suits decide to put season 3 on 2-sided discs (which defeats the whole purpose of a dvd-changer) but, to add injury to insult, poor manufacturing quality made 2 of the 4 sides un-readable and the other 2 sides only partially readable. I could tolerate the poor manufacturing as an anomaly, but the decision to make 2-sided discs is unforgiveable."
3,Very good shows but not a beautiful edition,"Five stars for the shows.Minus one star for the ms columbo episode bonus.Minus one great star for universal customer concern :-for the first season, universal had produced a beautiful 4 dvd digipack with french and spanish subtitles.-for the second season, digipack has been replaced by 2 standard keep case each containing 2 serigraphed dvd. French and spanish subtitles again.-for this third season and still for the same price, it is now 2 sideA/sideB dvd in keep case and only spanish subtitles.I hope the next season is not a vhs version !Rémy"
1,Amazon reversed reviews for seasons 2 and 3,Amazon gets 1 star for creating confusion.Some of the reviews included for Season 2 are about the shows in Season 3 - in fact even the title of some of the reviews says Season 3. The reviews for Season 3 are placed in Season 2. Someone trying to decide which season to order to get certain shows is in trouble unless they check the complete chronological list of programs in one of the conversation links.
1,Warning: Defective two sided dvds,"Universal needs to clean up their act. These discs freeze up on all my machines. Do I have any recourse? The third season of Columbo is great, but I only wish I could see it. I wouldn't mind my money returned, either."
2,Awful double sided disc quality,"I wish I was giving this 5 stars. I would be if I could actually watch the discs. But, each episode has glitches and problems. The discs lock up, pixelate, and jump around. They are awful."
5,"WOW - Like Interpol, only so much better!!","I don't write reviews generally, but since this one doesn't have any and I'm blown away by this... I haven't received this cd yet (I just ordered it today), but since you can stream the whole album from the bands website, I've heard it all... a couple times.This band is fantastic and I can not believe they aren't all over the place. They have a sound not unlike Interpol (which is used too much these days, but it's true). The difference is the music has more power, emotion and is just plain better. Until Amazon has clips to play, go to this bands website and stream the cd (then you will buy it - now).I hope mine arrives soon :)MP"
5,Can't wait to read this book,Can't wait to read this book. Loaned it to Pastor who is currently using it-
5,Fantastic Teen Fantasy Comedy!,"As a young teen, I really enjoyed this film and I have awaited it's DVD release for a number of years.This is a low budget teen comedy with a twist!Personally, I like the oddball music and have always thought that Lezlie McGraw was positively beautiful!A leprauchaun helps a nerd to get his dream girl!He, however, helps to get him in trouble too!Check this rare comedy out!"
1,"I got the 1st edition, not the 2nd.","This order ended up coming in very late for me. I needed it for a class, so I was left without it for awhile. When I finally received it, it ended up being the 1st edition, not the 2nd edition, like it says. Needless to say, I was pretty mad about the situation. However, my professor was understanding and actually said he prefers the 1st edition to the 2nd, but it threw off a lot of discussions."
3,Interesting read,"From the last chapter of the book: ""The unifying theme of American history between 1885 and 1914, so many historians have argued, was a popular attack against corporate wealth...This analysis accepts, uncritically, the popular ideas of the Populist-Progressive Era. It is a far too simple explanation."" About the popular movements of that era: ""They comprised a reaction not against the corporation alone but also against industrialism and the many ways in which it affected the lives of Americans...they attempted too cope with industrial change in all its ramifications...they centered their fire on the business leader, but he was a symbol of change which they could conveniently attack, rather than the essence of change itself."""
3,The Response to Industrialism 1885-1914,"I can't say I thought it was interesting, but that was mainly due to the fact that I bought it only for a school assignment. I would like to note that it goes in depth into industrialization and I think it was a great learning tool."
1,Stay with 9...or 8,"As a long-time Freehand user, MacroMedia continues to disappoint. Hardy anything new, yet commands are different and it is much slower than the previous version (which itself was slower than the previous version).MacroM has abandoned the print market anyway; I believe this is their last release of FreeHand. Its too bad, since it used to be a fine program."
1,Amazon change order policy,"Dansk Precision 20-Piece Stainless-Steel Flatware Set, Service for 4I ordered this patern by mistake ( wanted Bistro patern) and immediately tried to change the order but got an error message that it can't be changed because it is in the shipping chanels though it shows it won't be shipped for about 1 week. I can only wait until I receive it and then return and reorder. I certainly will not reorder nor will I ever purchase from Amazon in the future!"
1,Save yourself the dough,"Do not be mistaken, this is not RATT. For those of you that revel in the sound of one of the 80's most crunchiest of bands, this album is not for you. Stephen Pearcy is but a shell of his former self and his feeble attempt to resurrect hits from his heyday, crashes like a midget highjumper wearing cinderblock track shoes. Because of this album, I will now attempt to find all of my old RATT cassette tapes and listen to them on my crappy 80's Sony Walkman knockoff, just so that I can get stench of RAT ATTACK outta my head."
1,lackluster and boring...,I felt the movie was boring and very lackluster. The acting is very poor and the script is weak. The lighting is dark at times which makes it difficult to see what is going on. The short synopsis of the film on Amazon is more interesting and entertaining than viewing the film in its entirety.
5,Season 6 is one of the best!!!,"A great Season 5 sets up a brilliant Sixth Season. Just about every episode in this season will make you laugh! ""The One with Unagi"" is probably one of the funniest Friends episodes ever, not to mention ""The One With the Routine"" where Ross and Monica do their dance that they made up in high school! It's just classic! It's arguably the best season of all! Going by how the others were, I'd say that this DVD set is a must have with good features. Can't wait until January! Buy it!"
2,for packaging/Warner Bros.,"every time Warner puts out a Friends season, they get cheaper with the materials(thinner cardboard, etc). This time it's GLUE. I had to return mine TWICE cos the trays would come unglued because they weren't in the right place for it to stick to the cardboard(guess those automated machines arent too accurate). In the previous seasons, there were 8 places with glue on each tray, this season only has 4. So to anyone who works for warner: MORE GLUE. Take a hint from Columbia/Tri-star(Good times, What's happening, etc)...they do a good job. For a big show like Friends they sure are getting sloppy with their quality control."
3,great show bad delievery,the reason for the 3 stars instead of 5. is that i got the show fast but between citys the case got totally destroyed .but got lucky the dvds werein great shape .no scrathes or cracks . but seriosly the show is great take the chance
4,They should have ended in 1999,"I love friends and watch old episodes every day but they should have ended in 1999..... Here's what I think about all six seasons.Season 1 8/10Season 2 8/10Season 3 8/10Season 4 9/10Season 5 9/10Season 6 8/10and then....Season 7 4/10Season 8 10/10 for some episodes otherwise 4/10Season 9 8/10 for episode 1-8Season 10 1/10The ending was bad, sad boring and short."
2,"reply to ""Why do people like these guys? "" by Ziqzira Bundun","Dear Ziqzira BundungaThe above mentioned review may be ""shocking"" to diehard Friends fans.. I lost my ""smile"" at first glance...but on repeated reading the thoughts sunk in..This could be the best profiling of friends characters after the now famous outburst by guest star Fisher Stevens - ""dysfunctional group dynamic ... co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse and you're all like, 'Define me, define me."" (The One with the Boobies)If you think about it , you could find faults about all your dear ones (in real life). But we still love them inspite of their shortcomings..I really liked your opinion but i still love my ""Friends"""
5,I can't wait!!,"Forget the SuperBowl, I am going to be watching this DVD!! I can watch Friends over and over again, and still laugh!"
5,Terrific season,This is one of my favorite seasons of my favorite TV show!! Some of the greatest moments of the show are in the 6th season. The last episode never fails to make me tear up when Monica and Chandler get engaged. This is a must have for Friends fans!
1,Angry..,"I love this episode, but was hugely disappointed that I can't download it to my computer or tablet. I bought it so I could watch it away from home but I can only do that if I buy an apple product or a kindle."
5,It's joey!,Love the show. Love the actors. Love the characters. Now I can watch them when they run out of sindication with the bonus material.
1,This show is lost on me,What's so funny about friends who do nothing & sleep around. Score this another one for the lemmings.
2,Doesn't measure up,"Really, with shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm, the Simpsons, and Seinfeld (yes, even the reruns are better than today's prime time sitcoms) who needs Friends. It lacks the sharpness, and smart snappy dialogue of the aforementioned shows along with original subject matter and edgy material. Not to mention the annoying characters, off-putting romantic storylines, etc. etc. that makeup Friends."
1,People you've tried to avoid your entire life.,"Friends is immensely popular. No doubt. And I guess I understand that. The characters are very much like the ""populars"" you find in high school. Maybe a little bit smarter. Definitely a little bit funnier. But they're are the same shallow, repulsive folks that--if you had a little on the ball--you tried to avoid. Like the plague. You know the type. The girls who were more attractive than average, usually really skinny, and way too chipper. And then the guys. Kinda clunky. No depth at all. Smug.As you might have guessed, I find it very difficult to watch this show. Far from making me laugh, these characters make me want to leave. And the writing is so flat, so corporate, so uninspired, that it amounts to junk-food humor, with a carefully orchestrated laugh track so numbed viewers know exactly where to laugh.It's because of stuff like this that I've stopped watching TV altogether. Try it."
4,great season!,"This season had some very good episodes, such as The One That Could've Been (alternate universe) The One Where Ross Got High, and The One with the Proposal. I especially loved the gag reel on this DVD! (Maybe they'll make one with the first five!) Very good season for any Friends fan!"
1,order cancelled by company or Amazon without my consent,"I ordered this product, and found out a few days later that the order was cancelled without my consent either by the company or by Amazon. I'm not such a big fan of that."
5,How does the relationship between chandler & monica work?,"are they happy with this relationship?are they romantic infront of there friends?central perk is the place where they hang out, so do they romance over there too?well it's romantic and hot if they do ... infront of everyone, huh.4 childrens i cut the bad word, but learn it as soon as u get 15,k.i'll have to buy season six"
1,Just another once funny show,The sixth season just goes to prove just how funny this show once was and no longer is. It only gets worse from here.
3,"Great, but a little outdated","This is a great book to get you started in electronics, but it's a bit out-dated now.I say this because two of the transistors the author uses to build the power supply are already listed as ""not recommended for new designs"". They are also pricey at $6 and $10 each. Also the 4400uf 50V capacitors used are $44 each and you need 2 of them. I'm using 4x 2200uf at a dollar each instead.Also when looking for the radio shack PCB, take out the A from the end of the part number or you won't find it.Just as an FYI, the parts for the power supply will come out to close to $100.Although it would be great to skip ahead and order all the parts you will need so you can build it as you go, I recommend reading all those sections first so you can better understand what you can order, then re-reading them as you build it.I'd love to see a 2012 edition of this book...and without trying to use $44 capacitors."
3,Maybe I am just a blockhead...,"I like the idea of this book explaining things in such a way that a 10 year old boy could understand them. It does not do this. Terms and concepts are introduced kind of fast and you keep reading ""Now that all that theory is out of the way..."" only to turn the page and slam into some more equations. Personally, I could use a little more breathing room. A 10 year old would be discouraged by this book for sure. However, I will say that this book is one of the easier-to-understand books that I have come across in my quest for a rounder head. If I read it about 50 times then I think stuff might start clicking. Explaining the practical applications for the current concept being discussed would've been helpful. For instance, what is this circuit typically used for? Perhaps I haven't given it a fighting chance. These are my initial impressions, though."
2,not very helpful for a beginner,"I think this book is the worst of both worlds as a text or reference manual in that there are no real-world analogies in the first two chapters, and there aren't any really good tables for reference either. Also, in chapter two the description of capacitors (and their markings) makes no sense and the first page of chapter that ends with ""this is why all common household current is AC"" also makes no sense because it is preambled by a description of AC and no transformer action.I read chapter two a couple of times but still lack a good understanding because I NEED (as I imagine many do) some connection with the real world. The water pump example is good but it stops there. I dove into this text with an excitement and desire to diagnose and repair some old audio equipment that can see new life. I think I'd better find a better book before i get completely discouraged, or start working without good knowledge."
3,I hit the wall with the transistors chapter...,"Chapter 6 is where things get hard. I hit the wall at this point. The theory and usefulness of transistors is not explained well and is difficult to understand. Diodes, okay; transistors, not. Collectors, emitters, base? PNP vs NPN?I've read this chapter three times and still don't feel comfortable with these concepts. And understanding much of the rest of the book -- anything not related to digital electronics -- depends on mastery of this.The rest of the book is satisfactory and some of the projects are actually rather illustrative and cool. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to buy a second reference book in order to get over the transistors hump.This could be the nature of the subject matter, I don't know. Nonetheless, it's my hope that chapter 6 will be rewritten for a future edition."
5,The Good Guys,"Being a Canadian, this series (Corps) answers many questions why so many Canadians voluntarily enlisted in the US Marines - cameradrie, esprit de corps, courage, a sense of belonging to a unique and brave bunch of men. The only spot on the escutcheon is how one officer who was a liar, gutless and managed to survive in teh Corps. But the good guys make up for it - MacCoy, and all the others. I think this is the best Griffin series, next coem Cletus Frade."
2,A big scratch in the Back Cover.,"I received the book last week and it has a big scratch in the back cover. This is because they used only a Postal evelope, so it has this scratch and some other hits in the corners of the book. It arrived on time, but i suggest that it would be better if they use a cardboard box insted of an envelope."
2,ok,"He's ok. He is pretty but he's easy to break. My little sister got a hold on him and broke his lifted leg off, she scratched him, and broke off an ear. I'm disappointed."
3,OK,"Bought this product cause it LOOKED as if it was made of copper, not the case. Good product anyway.RoyHouston, Tx"
5,one of top ten books for kids,"My grandmother gave me this book when I was a kid-I loaned it to a lawyer friend who swore he never borrowed it.(never got it back...) Anyway, here is a first-quality reprint. Glad I found it! This is one book you would be proud to pass on to your grandkids. These animal stories are the best-realistic and they teach some rather important life lessons-all life forms die-it is how they live that determines their legacy.I will give this book to my grand-daughter in a few days. Real-life animal stories such as these are priceless in the lessons they convey to kids."
4,Chocked full of metaphors,"""Happy Valley"" is by no means a western, and truly does not need to be categorized as one. The book is a philosophical fantasy filled with characterization of metaphors, involving the basic struggle of Good versus Evil. Max Brand, the author, just chose to use a somewhat western setting to this story of fantasy. To enjoy the book, a reader certainly has to have full appreciation of the various analogies used by the author. As for entertainment, I really enjoyed Chapter 23 in which Chip Lander describes his excitement for the newest female to move into Happy Valley. Overall, reading the novel is certainly not a waste of time."
2,Less then comfortable,I really like Anne Klein shoes and have bought some in the past. I purchased these shoes thinking that they would be as comfortable and fit the same as the other Anne Klein shoes I have purchased. These shoes turned out to be very uncomfortable in the heel area and I have not been able to break them in. Everytime I where them I get blisters and can barely make it through the day wearing them. I am not sure if it is because I need a half size bigger or if the heel is so stiff that it can't be broken in.
4,I'm likin' it,I bought and installed this wall furniture last month and am very happy with it. Installation was a snap and the build quality seems good. I like how it doesn't take up a lot of wall space but still looks good. You can also get a surge protector in the back if you buy the right one. In fact I'd like to see Omnimount make a custom surge protector that mounts to the back area.
5,"Easy installation, looks good, good value","The OmniMount 2 shelf wall system is very easy to install and it looks great. It took less than an hour to figure out the instructions and complete the installation, including hiding all the wires in the cable management system. You'll need to purchase a pack of ties to secure the wires, which are not included. A few basic tools are needed to complete the install, but most people already own a screw driver, drill and level. The system is very sturdy and will easily hold three or four components. I have three components so I stacked my cable box on top of my DVD player. The cable box is light and the DVD player is vented in the rear so stacking is not a problem. The wood panels that cover the metal frame are made from plywood covered in an attractive and thick black wood veneer. The fit and finish are excellent."
3,"looks pretty sharp, but does not install exactly as specs say","this actually looks pretty decent (even with the parts somewhat separated as they are--no easy way the product manufacturer could have avoided that anyway)anyway, i used the first configuration to install (i think ""A""), and i actually followed the instructions as they showed. i am a contractor (additions, electrical, etc.), so i am a little better equipped than the average homeowner (tools, experience) in general, and i found the only way i could make it work as shown in the picture was to un-fasten the bottom (of 3) steel brackets (which are good and strong/rigid) from the other 2 and space it out (down about 2 inches or so) to fit the right cover piece on it--wasn't terribly difficult, just not exactly what the install instructions showed."
5,Perfect,"Looks great on the wall. Has plenty of room for everything (i.e. receivers, dvd player, etc). Easy to install. It came with a few extra bolts which was no problem to me. I was able to install it within 10 mintues. Hides all wires just as I was hoping. Highly recommend."
4,As advertised,"MWFS works as advertised. Fairly easy to install. Very nice soloution to the problem of multiple wires and cords when mouting a flat screen. Bought one of OmniMount's flat screen mounts as well, that was easy to install too. Very impressed with the company and their products."
1,Arrived broken twice in a row,"Ordered this product based on positive reviews.However, the product has arrived broken (the plastic anchors that were supposed to hold the top cover were smashed to pieces). Ordered a replacement. Got it the next day, opened the boxes and saw the same problem. Will get a refund and not buy it from Amazon."
4,Everyone loves it,"A bit pricey but it was well worth it. Installation was easy especially if you already have your TV mounted in the wall studs. Just follow the same studs. This is mounted below a 40"" Sony and looks great. The color is a dark wood brown. Not exactly black but you can hardly notice unless you have a spotlight in the area. Anything smaller and the mount may look too big (my opinion). Anyway, it looks great! As far as the WAF (wife acceptance factor) it rates very high! Four stars because of price. If it was a in the $150 price range it would earn 5."
4,looks great...,"This product is very sturdy and strong. The construction quality is great. The instructions are very poor indeed, but you should be able to figure out the assembly pretty easily on your own if you're handy. Would give it 5 stars but it is a bit overpriced in my opinion"
4,Great book for mythology lovers!,"Seaton's translation of the ""Argonautica"" is well written and easy to read. Because the work was completed in 1912, some of the language is archaic but not unreadable. The content of the book is enjoyable. For readers who enjoyed Homer's ""Iliad,"" they will enjoy the ""Argonautica"" especially since it delves into the heroic deeds of the Homeric heroes' forefathers. Additionally, the book is enjoyable in terms of mythology. (The relationship between Jason and Medea in Book 3 is thought to be a precursor to the story of Dido and Aeneas in Virgil's ""Aeneid."") Overall, an excellent book."
5,Fantastic Addition to my Library,The Loeb Classical Library is a wonderful source for classical literature. It has the ancient text in Greek on one side and Latin on the other. The introduction and notes are by reputable scholars that always add to the understanding of the text. They make a lovely addition to my library! I have many books from the Loeb Classical Library and they are all excellent!!! This copy of the Argonautica has a clear prose translation of the text and is well-written.
3,CAUTION!!!,"I have mentioned in a review of volume one that unfortunately these new titles are not the remastered 35mm material available in the UK.I have given 3 stars because of the content but they are not comparable to those available from Amazon.co.uk.Go multi-region with your DVD players and explore the world via Amazon (make sure you have a TV that can handle the UK PAL system - most modern sets will)Don`t forget the `Lost films` series of the boy`s early work remastered in the US, they are outstanding and from 35mm negatives.If anyone needs asistance on multiregion information feel free to contact meRemember as Stan said ""A horse can walk to water but a pencil must be lead""."
2,Not Up To Standards,"I bought this DVD because I was going to sell my 16mm copy of ""Way Out West"", however after watching this copy I desided to keep my film copy. I will say that ""Block Heads"" is much better than the other two."
1,I want a good copy!,"""Way Out West"" is my favorite Stan & Ollie film. It is consistantly clever; the horse on the balcony, the head under the pail, the bodies in the piano, and of course, the delightful dance sequence. Alas, I sold my really fine VHS version, expecting someone to eventually give justice to this fun romp. When do you think someone, even Criterion, will wake up and realize that quality entertainment cannot be compromised, and a loving public will not settle for mediocrity?"
2,"Eh, a so-so novel","Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I wanted more. This is the 3rd Sparks novel I've read (just to see if maybe I've read a couple bad apples) but I have yet to be compelled to stay up all night reading one of his books. My interest was peaked by the movie trailer for Rodanthe, so of course I picked up the book knowing it would be better instead. It was an easy read, which is what I was looking for seeing as how I was flying out of town for 3 days. But I just couldn't get into the characters' heads/shoes so much. I felt for them, but not on a very deep level. I don't find the characters in his novels to be all that dynamic. I feel somewhat teased by the lack of depth & development regarding storylines and characters. I keep giving Sparks the benefit of the doubt, but I'm let down every time. I don't understand how so many people find him to be so moving."
2,Cheesy and highly predictable,"I have to say the beginning of this book gave me a big warning that the writing was going to be very elementary and to top it all of a sappy love story. I like love stories which is why I picked this book up, but the writing was horrible! I can't believe this is a best selling author. I remember a few year back I read the notebook and a walk to remember and I at least liked those. I was disappointed and I wish he would have done a better job selling the reader this story."
1,Never Again!,"I have wasted my last dime on a Nicholas Sparks novel. After all the hype I finally purchased a copy in hopes that this time I wouldn't be disappointed. No such luck. The story is incredibly thin. The characters never capture the reader's heart or imagination. And, worst of all, why is Sparks seemingly incapable of writing a love story that lasts beyond a few days? I am sick and tired of woman (who life has treated a bit roughly) meets man (also battered by life); fall madly in love, but need to clean up one more thing before they can be together. Man dies during said clean-up and woman spends rest of life living on memories. Get a new formula or stop writing!"
4,Nights in Rodanthe,This book really moved me. It brought to life the love and trials that these two people experienced. In the telling of her story to her daughter it teaches that even though children may not realize that their parents may be very similar to them. Amanda is pushing her mother away because she believes that her mother does not know how it is to lose a lover without choosing it. But little did she know. Her mother had experience the deepest love her live and was never able to develpe it when it came to an unexpected end. This opened up a connecting between Amanda and her mother that would have never been possible had she not been told the story. This also teaches that love shows up in some of the most unexpected places and that you cannot resist it and you must follow your heart at all time. It is better to have loved and Lost than to have not loved al all.
4,Emotional & engaging,"This is a very poignant story, told in an engaging way, that I read in 1 day. I always enjoy Nicholas Sparks' writing, and to me his stories are very hit-and-miss-- while I always like his writing style/voice, sometimes the stories don't do it for me, other times they seem to reach right to my soul, such as The Notebook (all-time favorite), and Message in a Bottle.Nights in Rodanthe had a few weaker parts here and there; the daughter character could have been more developed for instance, but the romance and passion involved were so pure and honest. It was not a happy book, and after having read more about Nicholas Sparks' life in ""2 weeks with my Brother"" I understand more the losses he has had to deal with in life and how he can very accurately express those feelings of loss in his writing.Tearful but passionate-- you decide if that is for you or not."
4,Going Home!,I was born and raised in Pamlico/Craven/Carteret area so these books are always a wonderful walk down memory lane for me but i have to admit.... the plots are starting to blur. But .... I continue to read them for that rich landscape and drama of Carolina weather!! and the walks on the beach!!!
4,"Never read ""Romance"" but . . this one was worth the read",I NEVER read romance novels. This one caught my eye. Nights in Rodanthe is worth the read. It has a story within a story and keeps you turning the pages.
1,TOO PREDICTABLE,"First off let me start by saying I love Sparks and own all of his books. I just read this one, and it was awful. I knew what was going to happen after the 5th page. The book was too short, and there were not enough pages devoted to the weekend at the Inn. BORING!Of all books of Sparks to make into a movie, I can't believe they chose this one. There are others that are much better, such as A Bend in the Road or At First Sight."
3,Nights in Rodanthe,"I am not surprised that this novel is going to become a movie. Sparks is a good romance story teller. Sometimes his stories are a little too predictable.Adrienne, a 60 year old, is divorced and a mother of 3 children. She tries to help her daughter cope with the recent death of her husband and then we are thrown back into time.Adrienne at age 45, just recently divorced - meets Paul, a surgeon - divorced, who is on his way to try to reconcile his relationship with his son. Paul worked too much and had no relationship whatsoever with his wife or son. Paul's world is ripped apart when he loses a patient.Paul stops at a bed and breakfast in Rodanthe. Adrienne is working there. The love affair starts and Adrienne takes us on a journey into the past, almost making you feel like you were there - watching. However, I must say that I did expect the story to end the way it did. It was obvious how it would end."
4,Nice love story with a message,"Nights in Rodanthe is a typical Nicholas Sparks book, a satisfying enjoyable love story & a quick read.Don't expect this book to impress you beyond your wildest dreams and you won't be disappointed. But one thing about Spark's books, you can always count on a read that will take you away to another place & a story that will inspire you. And most definitely, you'll cry!This is the story of Andrienne & Patrick who fall in love over a weekend they spend together. They fall in love during a time in their lives that they're most unhappy and alone. Now, years later Adrienne is telling their story to her daughter Amanda, to help her with a difficult time in her life. Thus, the lesson is revealed.I truly enjoyed this book. I enjoy Spark's writing for a bit of the break in the heavy dramatic novels or crime stories I usually read. This did the trick! Not as good as Message in a Bottle or the Notebook, but still a wonderful read."
3,Least favorite.,"This was my least favorite written by Sparks, but I still was amused by the plot. It seems surreal for a women and man to fall in love so quickly. A man comes down, meets this women who works at an Inn. I don't believe in this love at first site ordeal, but I guess it could happen."
4,Love found--love lost,"Nicholas Sparks is back at doing what he does best--writing about lost love. Adrienne Willis, the divorced mother of three, is looking back on her life and realizing that she needs to tell her love story to her daughter who is grieving over the death of her husband. She surprises her daughter by telling her of her meeting with surgeon Paul Flanner who is seeking solace in an old Inn on the Outer Banks which Adrienne is tending for a friend. Of course a big storm comes and they discover a love for one another which is to change the course of their lives. Some of this is entirably predictable, but Sparks has a way of writing which captures your heart."
3,Cute Story,"This is a short book that is really easy to read. You can see where things are headed before reading it, but it's still cute nonetheless."
3,"Got a new book, ruined in the mail","When I got the book, it was brand new, but the packaging bent it out of shape and now it's permantely damaged and the hard cover itself has bent lines in it showing that the book was forced into a small opening."
5,Have A Box Of Tissues Handy!,This is classic Nicholas Sparks. Heart warming and heart breaking all wrapped up in a nice little package. You don't know whether to hate him or love him because of the way it all ends.This is also one of my favorites from him. a true testament to live life to the fullest and like every day just may be your last and to hold on to love with all you are worth.
1,"Three Strikes, You're Out!","Adios, Nicholas. Another repetitive, predictable story with manufactured emotion. There are so many other new writers who write with depth and originality. Nicholas will have to earn back my loyalty. Skip this one and reread The Notebook."
3,More fresh voices,"I still really enjoy Nicholas Sparks' works, though I admit my passion for each successive book has waned. I agree with many others here who are looking for fresh voices. Both Mary Alice Monroe (Beach House) and Kirk Martin (Shade of the Maple) write stories with great meaning that move you deeply, without the predictability of a Sparks novel. They paint pictures with words the way Nicholas does. I would recommend both highly, they have become my favorite authors."
2,Sooo Disappointed!,"I am a longtime fan of Nicholas Sparks, but I am so disappointed by Nights in Rodanthe. I had hoped he would be able to come up with something new this time. I liked the past couple books, but to be honest they have been getting pretty monotonous. And nothing is new with this one. It's the same old story - a man and woman who have painful pasts meeting in some unlikely situation that just seems made up. And of course they fall in love and help each other get over their pain. I felt like I knew what was going to happen before it happened because I have read this same story before, just with different characters. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was hoping Nicholas could have come up with something different."
2,well below his bar of excellence,"It is obtuse to belittle an author for writing in the same style and genre that has been so successful for them in the past. When you buy a Nicholas Sparks novel, this is the kind of literature you will read---it ain't Hemmingway. However, formulaic writing doesn't mean knocking off your own best efforts and that of other successful authors. This book could rightfully be called ""NOTEBOOK IN A BOTTLE IS FOUND UNDER THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY."" The one sin that installment writers must be chastised for is: Predictability. To Mr. Sparks then I must say, ""Shame; shame,"" and ""Tisk-tisk"" for this novel."
1,Nights in Rodanthe,"Meaningless drivel. The characters are flat and lathargic and completely lacking in chemistry. The book goes on and on, but the people never actually do anything. Characters generally reveal themselves through their actions, but these paper thin people just sit around thinking about themselves and their terrible lives."
2,Nights in Rodanthe,I had problems with the continuing shifting of the time line. It seemed that each initial flashback either had another flashback or another shift. I pressed on and found a formula plot and wished this message had been stuffed in a bottle. The writing was definitely heavy handed and contrived.
3,An Unlikely True Story,"I find the stody to be very well written. Nicholas Sparks takes you through the facets of life in one short story. The beginning of the book had me wondering where he was going with the story, but when the storytelling began, it all fell into place. The story reflects what a lot of people go through in life. We all walk around with so much joy and pain that it is surprising we are not zombies.I recommend this book for anyone going through twisted emotions to which Nicholas Sparks did a fine job describing."
4,A nice love story that is believable,"The best thing about this love story was that it seemed realistic. It wasn't too sappy or overly romantic.You get to know the two main characters very well and feel like they are real people. They are not perfect, but the delicate way they deal with each other is touching.This story is nicely written with beautiful descriptions. I could clearly envision the house, beach, and town (etc).Obviously, this is an emotional book (as I guess all N. Sparks books are), so be prepared to shed a tear or two. I don't think one will regret reading this book. It is sad and uplifting all together."
4,Just What I Needed!,"Ahhhhh, another tender romance!! I can always count on Nicholas for a heartwarming story and a good cry, too! I can't wait for his next one. Like many others have mentioned, I also really loved Shade of the Maple and The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin and The Beach House by Mary Alice Monroe."
5,it warmed my heart,i couldnt put it down. i fell in love with each page. i was sad when it ended. great read.
3,The Shack & Nights in Rodanthe,I received the books from 2 different sources. No problems as usual. Thank you.
2,A complete rip-off of Bridges of Madison County,"I was looking for something light to listen to while I run, and I was familiar with Sparks's simple writing style, so I put Nights in Rodanthe on my Ipod. It's completely unoriginal, though, aside from the fact that the two main characters are both divorced and since neither is cheating on a spouse as in Bridge of Madison County, the story is less scandalous. Other than that, everything is the same, from the fact that the story of the affair from years ago is now being related to an adult daughter to the outing to dance at a roadside bar. I was very disappointed."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and I've read just about all of his books. I have to say I was definitely not impressed with this one. It was somewhat short and unrealistic. Although Sparks usually writes about love stories that are just too good to be true, this one definitely takes the cheese over the top. It's still a good story, but I think he could have gone much more into it and created a better plot."
2,Not his best work,The plot seemed to lack direction. I've come to expect really great stuff from Nicholas Sparks but this time I felt disappointed.
3,Sappy Story,"This was the first book written by Nicholas Sparks that I have read. Didn't care for it. Predictable, boring. I won't read another of his books."
1,Overrated,"This book was a major snooze. I only felt compelled to finish it because I paid for it. The characters had no depth and I found I didn't really care what happened in the end, I just wanted it to be over!! And, worst of all writing sins, the ending was totally predictable."
2,Disappointing,"Is Nicholas too full of himself now? What used to be an exciting event awaiting his books has become too disappointing. This story is predictable. You know what the characters are going to say and do. It seems like he keeps recycling the same sympathetic men and women, just placing them in new situations that are themselves predictable. Yes, I expect more from Nicholas Sparks, especially when he is making millions off his devoted fans and offers us one more disappointing novel after another. Most authors write better over time, Nicholas seems to have gotten worse."
1,"Boring, Unrealistic and Insulting to Middle-Aged Women","This book was not particularly well written or imaginative. It was totally predictable. My major issue with this book is that Nicholas Sparks does not know how to realistically portray middle-aged women. His idea of describing Adrienne is going on in detail about how ""like most women, she never lost the weight after having children"". He makes her pathetic, insecure and a door mat to her husband and children and then bitter and stupid about her divorce. Ater her transformation in Rodanthe, she becomes a saint, valued counsel and miracle worker. The transformation is too drastic and without any realism. Don't bother with this book. Like another reviewer, I bought it looking for a good read while traveling. Nicholas Sparks is manipulative of the reader's emotion but can't entertain the reader like a real novelist. It's a shame he makes money from writing such dreck."
3,A tender love story,"After the break up of Adrienne Willis's marriage, she absorbed herself in the task of rearing her children but was left with a feeling of worthlessness. She agrees to run an Inn for a friend for 5 days and is agreeably surprised by her only guest, a noted surgeon, Dr. Paul Flanner, with whom she feels an instant attraction. He is just as drawn to her and they share 5 days of love and warmth.He explains to her that he is divorced and admits to being a work obssessed and negligent father who would now like to make things right with his son, also a doctor, and working with the poor in Equador.They agree that after Paul spends his committed time in South America, he will return to her and make a life together. Things don't work to plan and Adrienne is forced to conceal her grief and to reassess her life once again."
2,Too much like Bridges Of Madison County,"I've like Nicholas Sparks novels since 1999 with Message In A Bottle,but this one as to be the most dissapointing one of them all.I was like ""Been there,done that.""Read The Notebook or his new one The Guardian instead of this one."
4,A Well Written Love Story,"I almost gave the book a rating of 3 but there were some good qualities in the writing that bumped it up to a 4. I like the way the writer was able to reveal the love between Seth and Drucilla without all the vulgarity found in some books. The story was told in a way that the reader could use his/her imagination as to what when on between to lovers.I do believe that the story was told to Amanda to help her get through the grief of loosing her husband. But, I think the mother got much more out of it for herself."
2,Disappointed,"Nicholas Sparks usually writes beautiful love stories. He blew it with this book. The plot is an inplausible knock-off of Bridges of Madison County. Change the names and occupations and you've got it covered. One weekend of romance transforms into the love of a lifetime that sustains her for the rest of her life? Yeah, right."
4,Nights in Rodanthe Review,"After reading the latest Nicholas Spark's novel, Nights in Rodanthe, I was not disapointed. I ventured into the novel looking for a romantic love story, and that is exactly what I got. I do not feel that this was Spark's best work, but it is not worth passing up reading the novel. The age of the characters is shifted from his earlier works, to that of middle aged individuals, which people may find interesting. As always, I enjoyed the quick pace and recommend this great novel to all who are looking for romantic read."
4,More Sparks,"Another touching story from Nicholas Sparks - I read through it in one sitting! Cannot wait to read The Wedding, the follow up to The Notebook. In the meantime, for Sparks fans hungry for a great read, try Shade of the Maple and The Garvel Drive by Kirk Martin and The Last Promise by Richard Paul Evans."
1,Too Predictable,"I was so excited to read a good love story, only to find I had to FORCE myself to finish this book. We never even get close to having feelings for these characters, I could have cared less about Adrienne, the first words she said to Paul used improper and unladylike language. Like she's not going to be alittle creeped out about staying in a B & B alone with some strange man she doesn't even know!!! How stupid! This was by far one of the sappiest, predictable books I've ever read! Sorry Nicholas, I won't read you again!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I have been a BIG fan of Nicholas Sparks ever since I read the Notebook. I anxiously await all of his releases. He really disappointed me on this one. I found the story line to be lacking. I kept waiting for the story to ""get better"", it never did."
2,I Really Wanted To Like This Book,"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this book, since I have loved his other books, The story between Adrienne and Paul to me there were not believable as a couple in love, it did not keep my interest. I even feel bad giving it two starsHappy Reading Lisa : ) Smile"
2,We've Read This Before,"I am a huge Sparks fan, but this is the last straw. Each of his novels keeps getting more and more predictable, and the writing just doesn't seem sharp anymore. Has success made him lazy? We've seen this story a thousand times. I hope he does something original next time."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I feel cheated having pre-ordered this book, spending my hard-earned money, only to find a lackluster story written by the man who is supposed to be the preeminent storyteller of our time. Sure, it's heartwarming, but I could read a few Hallmark Cards and feel the same thing. I feel manipulated now and taken for granted. The characters are predictable, the circumstances contrived and the story so obvious it lacks any power. I think Nicholas has lost his way. Maybe it's time for some new authors who respect their readers to emerge."
1,DON NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,I ordered from this seller and it is now an month and a half later and still have not recied my book or any contact from the seller that i have emailed.
1,NO BOOK,so i ordered that book back in FEBURARY and it was supposed to get to me by MARCH 16. it is now MAY 25. and still no book. so can i please get a refund of my money?
1,liked it better when it was called Bridges of Madison County,"Just an old story. I think Sparks got tired in writing this story. The book is shorter than most and i felt no connection to the characters. None of the characters were well defined. The story has been told before. I have never been disappointed with a Sparks novel, but this one did. I hope his next one returns to the wonderful work I am used to seeing."
1,Unbelievable Story,"Can you really imagine meeting this renowned surgeon at a b&B where you are the acting owner and this guest starts chopping vegetables, putting up storm shutters, picking up plates from dinner, making his bed, etc. Get real. Our own husbands would probably not do this at home although we might want them to. I felt this was total fantasy reading, which is great if you want something to read before bedtime. Once you start the first page you can imagine the ending. I know I did. Maybe this story fulfills a need in 40+ women who are searching for that perfect man and, as usual, the hero gets killed so it remains a perfect relationship."
3,An in-between read.,"This book was a bit Peyton Placeinish, but this type of literature historically reads well, so you can't blame Sparx for perpetuating his formulaic success. This book reads pretty well, but you would dump it if a better book came along."
3,Another Heartwarming Read,"Nights in Rodanthe is another heartwarming read from Nicholas Sparks. Predictable and short, yes, but still a good read. I am afraid he has grown a little complacent in his writing, but fortunately there are other writers like Mary Alice Monroe, Kirk Martin and Lisa Wingate who move me with deep, inspiring, and original stories."
3,Not his normal page turner...,"...but ""Nights in Rodanthe"" was enjoyable. The love story followed the formula that Sparks always uses, but the focus seemed more on the mother/daughter relationship than the love story. This was a nice twist, but Nicholas needs to stick with what he knows.This was a BIG letdown for Sparks' followers. The book is short and not as exciting to read as his previous romances.Read the book, don't expect anything outstanding."
2,I've read better,"The best description I can give Nights In Rodanthe is 'Good'.I've read far better than this. I must say that as a faithful Nicholas Sparks reader I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was with, 'The Notebook', or 'A Walk to Remember'. Those two books were my absolute favorites by Sparks in terms of love and inspiration, but this one really wasn't all that grand!If you like his writing style read 'The Notebook', and 'A Walk to Remember'."
4,One of Sparks' better stories...,"I have to admit the following: I am not a Nicholas Sparks fan, and my preference for this book probably stems from my current life situation.That said, while predictable, this novel was a page-turner and also full of more memorable quotes than any of the previous Sparks books I have read. If you are a fan of his, I suggest giving it a go; even if you dislike him, I think it's worth the day or two it will take to read it!"
2,Disappointed Read,"Nights In Rodanthe by Nicholas Sparks was a disappointing novel for me. I usually enjoy Mr. Sparks books. My favorites have been The Notebook, The Rescue and A Walk To Remember. I didn't like the characters, especially the narcissistic surgeon Paul. It's hard to believe that he could change his entire personality in just a few days. Adrienne, the woman who falls in love with Paul during a hurricane, seemed lifeless and bland. I liked her better 15 years later, as she was telling her daughter the story of her love affair. However, it does seem that Adrienne and Paul found redemption in their lives without each other. Not one of Sparks better books. I don't intend to see the movie.Mary J. McCauley"
4,My First Sparks Novel,"This is the first Nicholas Spark novel I have read. I've seen the movie version of ""The Notebook"" (one of my favorite movies) and ""Nights in Rodanthe"", which I enjoyed. I saw this book selling for fifty cents at a used book store and figured I'd give it a try, as usually the book is better than the movie.I was surprised at how quickly I read through this book. I haven't read a fiction book in a long time and found myself inspired to pick it up two nights in a row. I probably finished it in about 4 or 5 hours.Even though it wasn't all that deep, I really enjoyed it. And though I knew the ending before I even picked up the book, tears flowed freely at the end (I did however, like the ending of the movie better. The scene where she sits waiting for him after cooking an amazing meal was so sad and I was really surprised at the ending.)I liked it enough that I want to read more of Spark's novels. I am definitely going to read another one very soon."
4,I have read the book and the seen the movie,"I read the book twice. The second time was when I discovered a movie was coming out and I needed to refresh my memory. Viewing the movie was okay. It was a tearjerker in the end. Very good acting on Diane Lane's part. I can say, however, that I liked the book better."
2,Enough Already...,"same predictable story, circumstances that are forced and contrived, just the names have changed. i fell in love with the notebook, but i feel like nicholas sparks takes his readers for granted now. i never wanted to admit this, but he's just not that good anymore."
2,"Bring the tissues, all right...","The quote on the front of the book claims that I will be reaching for the tissue box. Well, I did. This story was so sappy-sweet that my eyes watered up due to sugar shock.I had to remind myself that I wasn't reading Bridges of Madison County, the story lines were so similar. The characters, Paul and Adrienne, are likeable enough, but the plot is just too predictable. From the first chapter, this book's plot can be perfectly mapped. There are no sudden twists or turns or anything all that compelling, really.I have had so many people recommend Nicholas Sparks' novels to me, and now, I have to wonder why. I like a good romance as much as the next person, but I also would like a little plot. I give the book two stars because I did enjoy the characters and some of the dialogue; however, most of this novel lacked ""sparks."""
5,Nights in Rodanthe,Very interesting as only Nicholas Sparks can do it. He is one of my favorite authors. The price is ok for me.
4,Realistic and enchanting,"Nicholas Sparks has a way with words to bring the characters alive. The romances,keen observations of the settings, twist and turns in the plot keeps ones interest as the story unfolds. I have read many of his books and plan to read more."
2,Did not enjoy reading this one!,"This book was not as enjoyable as Nicholas Sparks'previous books. I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""The Notebook"", and ""A Walk to Remember."" Now I have mixed feelings about reading the most recent book."
2,not my fav,"Love Nicholas Sparks, but I was not thrilled with this book. It seemed to drag on and jump around a bit."
3,A good one nighter...,"If you are in the mood for a quick read, it took me just a few hours to complete the book, then this might interest you. I'd say this book isn't any better than a made for T.V. movie, or prime-time episode of your favorite t.v. show. Although, it isn't that great, it isn't horrible either. Nights in Rodanthe is a very typical Nicholas Sparks book with all of the same style and writing techniques. Love story, flashbacks to a time when all was right in the world yadda yadda yadda. It's a good way to fill a night where not much else is on the horizon."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and I was thrilled when I found out he had a new book out. This book was an old-fashioned love story about 2 people finding true love with each other. The two main characters, Adrienne Willis and Paul Flanner were both extremely likable characters and I found myself rooting for them to be together forever. I don't want to give anything away but I will say the ending was predictable and not a complete surprise. I still really enjoyed this book and felt fulfilled when it was over. Nicholas Sparks has such a wonderful way with words and is a true romantic. I can't wait till his next book!"
2,He's Lost It,"The Notebook is my all-time favorite novel, but it seems Nicholas Sparks books have gone downhill since, especially lately. They are basically the same story retold with predictable storylines. I used to overlook his simple writing, but looking back I realize for the past few books he has written nothing more than strings of cliches and stereotyped characters.I used to look forward to his new releases. No more. He needs to earn back our loyalty."
1,Nights in Rodanthe,I could not finish this book. It was too predictable and the characters had no depth. The writing style is boring to put it mildly.
2,Not believable,I picked up this book wanting to love it but finished it with disappointment. I find it truly unbelievable that the main characters were able to fall in love in such a short time with such superficial conversations and a couple of nights of sex. Life changing? I wasn't feeling it. Obviously something occurred between these two characters that Nicholas Sparks failed to clue the reader in on. Hopefully the screenwriters for the movie were able to fill in the blanks to make it more believable than the book.
3,"It's a short love story, That's about it.","My title is probably the same way Nicholas Sparks described the book to his wife when writing it. This is my first Nicholas Sparks book to read, but I'm sure like alot of other authors he writes basically the same book over and over again. The good thing was that it didn't take long to read, so I didn't have to wait long to start my next book."
4,"Very good, however, follows Sparks' general format.","I read Nights in Rodanthe last night in two hours and really did enjoy it, however, I can't help but notice that all his books are seeming more and more alike to me. I mean, one of the lovers always dies at the end...after reading nearly all his books, it's getting kind-of old and very predictable. Overall, a good book with a heartfelt message and I do recommend it."
2,"Ok, but not his best...","I'm a big Nicholas Sparks fan and adore A Message in a Bottle. Rodanthe is a pretty fast read, but I was somewhat disappointed in the story. It just didn't have the same intensity or charm that some of his other books have. It was also similar in some respects to Message in a Bottle but without the passion or longing. Although it's not the worst book I've ever read, I found it to be just ""ok."" In fact, I took it on my vacation to a cabin, and although I usually keep all my good books to re-read again, I left this one there in their guest book stack."
2,"Unfortunately, not his best work","I hate saying this, being a big fan of Sparks' and all, but it wasn't good. At all. It's my least favorite novel of his. The storyline was boring, and overall it was just a pain to get read. Nicholas Sparks can do MUCH better than this. If anyone is wanting to read a few of Sparks' novels, put this one at the bottom of your list."
4,Nights in Rodanthe,"Being a women of almost 45 I found this wonderful, most books make women of 30 sound boring, not sexy and undesirable but Nicholas Sparks description of Adrienne and Pauls relationship sound romantic, sexual and fullfilling."
2,I just didn't like it,"Sorry, Nick. It's not you. Maybe you had a deadline or something. I have loved every other book you have published, but this was a disappointment. For his fans and collectors of his works--of course you will want to get it anyway. For those who are just learning of Nicholas Sparks, hold off on this one. Try the Notebook (of course much better than the film) or A Bend in the Road instead."
4,excellent book,"I found the book to be very well written. Had I not seen the movie first, I would definately have gone to see asap. The book had me in tears when they had their mother and daughter talk about lost love."
3,Predictable but enjoyable,"Nicholas Sparks is a reliable writer, always delving up heart-warming and gut-wrenching moments. Nights in Rodanthe was predictable but nonetheless entertaining. Read this if you want a good romance."
2,Here we go again,"Here we go again... another depressing book by Nicholas Spark. I wish I were a psycologist to try to understand why he is always writing about the very same things. It is always the same characters in the same sad plot. Let's see: The Notebook (not too bad), A walk to remember (didn't we see this before?), The True Believer (sounds interesting at the beginning and becomes very boring...). I thought I was done with Spark; however, since I was in the airport waiting for my boarding, I bought the book... I should have borrowed from the library. Oh, dear."
2,lame,"I like a well-written romance...but this one isn't even up to Harlequin standards. Tissue-thin plot + wooden dialogue + phoney-feeling situations.Sample dialogue (p.70):""Do you like wine?""""What kind is it?""She set the chicken on the counter, then pulled one of the bottles out.""It's a pinot grigio. Is that okay?""I've never tried it. I usually go with a chardonnay. Have you?""""No.""I sincerely hope the movie is better. Don't waste your money on the book."
2,A Night of Disappointment!,"By page 7 we know the ending. The romantic scenes are cliches without depth. Nicholas never established a real connection between Paul and Adrienne. So they had a couple nights together at an inn, but that doesn't translate into a life changing relationship. I am a romantic, but I couldn't buy it. I am afraid that Nicholas has grown accustomed to pulling our heartstrings with the right words and scenes, but he has lost his originality."
2,Predictable as a blonde joke,"I list A Walk to Remember as one of my favorites. Wept over Message in a Bottle. Kept my nose in The Notebook until the bitter end and recommended The Rescue to everyone I know. But this? Are we SURE is is by Nic Sparks? Could have fooled me. I could have written the next chapters as I went along. Maybe he just needs a break, b/c he has an amazing talent, and this wasn't worthy of him."
3,Nicholas Does The Same Story Again :(,"I enjoyed Nights in Rodanthe. It was touching and Nicholas Sparks pushed the right buttons again, but I felt I had read this story already. Sure I know others have complained that he's corny and sappy, but I don't mind that, sometime's it's good to just get away. But every story now is basically the same. I feel a little cheated, like he's just churning these stories out because he knows we'll flock to pick up the next one. I am going to wait for paperback next time. Anyone want a slightly used copy?"
2,"""Bridges of Madison County""....enough said Mr. Sparks!","Cliche' and shallow characters. The story line gave out before I was convinced of anything happening between these two characters. ""Cookie cutter"" book. Painful at times to read. Has Robert James Waller spoken to his legal people about this copycat? P.S. Bridges of Madison County was WAAAAAYYYYY more believable!"
4,Nights In Rodanthe,"The Nights In Rodanthe was a really good book. I enjoyed reading it because it was really romantic, just like all of Nicholas Sparks' books. The way he writes the characters makes you feel connected to them as if they were your own friends. I recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a good love story."
5,A Beautiful Love Story,This is one of the best Nicholas Sparks' books that I have ever read. It is a beautiful story of two people who learn what love is later in life only to have it ripped from them. It is also a story about a mother giving her daughter the strength needed to survive after the death of her husband. I would reccomend this book to every romantic who loves reading.
4,sweet,"I typically do not enjoy the romance genre but I actually really enjoyed this book. Unlike some reviewers who thought this book insulted their intelligence, I think the plot is plausible- you have to accept the book on its own terms. I totally believed that two souls can encounter one another and change each other- even in one weekend. I have known people for whom this has happened. Granted, the novel is occassionally predictable, but it touched me.I especially liked that there is an emphasis on the idea of grief and having to go on for children. Not orginal but the author really deals with it in a positive way. He is a good writer and one that I will try again."
3,Too predictible,I used to love Nicholas Sparks books but they are are now predictible. When I finished this one I just sighed and was left with what I was going to read next. Usually when I finish something I love I can't wait to read another from the same author or have fun just enjoying the moment. Not this time. Sorry Mr. Sparks.
3,Read the book first,"Richard Gere & Diane Lane were convincing in their roles. Having recently read the book, I was disappointed in how much the storyline of ""telling the story"" was changed from the book. I thought that the movie lacked the romance of Nicholas Sparks' book. If you like to read, read the book first, then watch the movie. If you don't care to read, watch and enjoy the movie as it's a good story!"
1,NO BOOK,IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SINCE I NEVER GOT THE BOOK BUT THEY GOT MY MONEY. I HAD TO GIVE THIS BOOD A STAR ONLY TO GET AMAZON TO PUBLISH THIS REVIEW THAT THEY ASKED FOR AMAZON WHAT GIVES?
2,Bridges of Madison County Part 2,This book proved to be rather boring and extremely predictable. The book is extremely similar toThe Bridges of Madison Countywith the unhappy wife/ex-wife and the charming gentleman that writes love letters.There was nothing creative in the book as it seems to pull heavily from Bridges of Madison County. I did not think this was that good of a book compared to Sparks other books. It is overly melodramatic with long damatic pauses and overly dramatic talk.
2,"Too predictable, even for Sparks","A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite."
2,same ole same ole,"I have read all of nicholas sparks books. After a BEND IN THE ROAD...i was feeling that they all seemed very similar. I felt that even more so after NIGHTS IN RODANTHE. It seemed a repeat , in many ways, of his other stories; some things so familiar......the growing romance while fixing dinners and eating together, lovemaking in storms, unexpected death of one of the romantic charachters. A WALK TO REMEMBER was the first Sparks book i read, and thought it was the most charming and inspirational story i have read in a long time. I had seen MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, but decided to pick up the book and read anyway, and couldnt put it down. But since THE RESCUE, it seems i am reading the same story over and over again. I want to love Nicholas Sparks, but the predictability is causing me to lose interest.sheila shepard, richmond va."
4,Bookwalker,Loved the story. It is definitely suitable for holiday reading. Enjoyed it immensely. Thanks.I have purchased a number of Nicholas Sparks stories and love his style.
2,Not Sparks' Best,"Let me just start off by saying that I absolutely LOVE Nicholas Sparks's book, but I just couldn't even like this book. Maybe it was because I had already seen the movie, but I didn't care about any of the characters. I felt like all they did was talk about the same things that are wrong with them over and over again. When I saw the movie I cried but when I read the book I just read faster, trying to finish it sooner. Also, I didn't really enjoy reading about 40 year olds in love. It may be because I'm a lot younger, but I just didn't care. I would have liked to read more about Adrienne's daughter and the husband she lost than Adrienne herself. It just lacked the chemistry and full-blown romance that I'm used to from Sparks. Nights In Rodanthe is probably Nicholas Sparks's worst book, but I know that I'll never stop reading his stuff. I've gone through his worst, so there are only good things to come from him!"
2,Let Down,"After devouring Sparks' other books, I seen this one and purchased two copies before the book was even released. One for my sister and one for myself. It took me a while to get into this book. Even then, I had to force myself to finish it hoping that it would get better as it went along. My sister read through it faster than I did, which doesn't happen normally. We both agree that this is definitely NOT one of his best books. However, we are still holding out hope for his next book ""The Guardian"". Our fingers are crossed."
2,Very Disappointing,"If you have read Message in a Bottle, then save your money as this reads almost like it. I have both Message in book & video & LOVED it & as I read this, I kept finding overlapping story lines. Man is alone, woman falls into picture, they're alone, love hits, fall into bed, one of them doesn't make it to the end of the book (will let you find out who on your own) & the one left behind is left with memories. Oh, Message in a Bottle just kept replaying over & over in my mind as I read it. C'mon, Sparks, I expected more from you than this. I know most love stories are along the same lines but change ""something"". All you need to do is skip to the last few pages & you know the outcome. Basically, a start of a story & an end...nothing in between."
5,Nights In Rodanthe,"This book has received a lot of mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. I am a SUCKER for romance so NIGHTS IN RODANTHE was just my cup of tea. Break out the economy size box of Kleenex because this one's a tear-jerker. The last time I cried over a love story the way I did with this one was about 6 or 7 years ago when ""Titanic"" came out.Nicholas Sparks is a great writer. The progression of love between Adrienne and Paul was so overwhelming; I had butterflies in my stomach. I sat on the train on my way to work just smiling as I read. I felt like I was a part of the story, literally feeling every iota of emotion expressed upon the pages.Yes it is sappy and syrupy sweet, but aren't those the key ingredients for the perfect romance novel? Aren't you supposed to feel like (if you're not already) falling in love?The end was so poignant, and I still can't get over it. NIGHTS IN RODANTHE will touch your heart and warm your soul. This is a story that I will ALWAYS remember."
4,Well written,"Sparks is a very good writer. And this book is well written and short. But so far it has been my least favorite of all his books. With this, his latest love story, he tells us the story of two shattered people. Both sadly scarred by past experiences. Who find each other late in life and realize they are soul mates.The story takes place in a small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina where Adrienne Willis is tending to a friends Inn as she re-thinks her life. Her husband had left her three years earlier for a younger woman. And the Inn's only guest, Paul Flanner who has just sold his medical practice and has come to Rodanthe to escape his own shattered past.This meeting of the two takes place within the midst of major storm. Which brings these two people closer together. And we share their weekend together. A weekend that will change them. As well as affect the rest of their lives."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"This is one of the best books I've read in a while (last one: ""Girl With A Pearl Earring""). Actually I don't read as much as I should or want to, but since I have a ""touch"" of ADD, the storyline really has to grab my attention. And, this one did a good job. I told a friend of mine about it and I traded it for one she had just finished.....""The Guardian"". I had already bought ""The Wedding"", but since now I see that ""The Notebook"" is a prequel to that, I'll go ahead and read ""The Guardian"" before I start ""The Notebook"". Whoa.....I'm all ""sparked"" out!! Another reason I liked ""Nights"" was that it was fun reading about familiar names, places, etc. since we lived in Raleigh, NC for 10 years and went to the beach a lot in the summertime. I think I've finally found an author who can hold my attention,"
5,Wonderful easy read!,"This is the 3rd Sparks novel that I've read and as the others, this one was too beautifuly written. I finished the book in 2 days. Although it had a somewhat sad ending, it was an excellent read. I'm not sure why this book only received 3 stars. It deserves more credit."
3,Not Sparks' Best Work,"I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks. So when I picked up this book, I expected a truly touching love story that required an entire box of kleenex.Unfortunately, I did not need any kleenex. I found this book to be very predictable and not the least bit emotional. If you are really bored and want to be entertained for a few hours, then pick this book up. But if you are looking for a true tearjerker, I encourage you to pick up A Bend in the Road, The Rescue, or The Notebook (all by Nicholas Sparks). These are some of my favorite books, and I gaurantee, after you read them, you will never forget them."
1,La junque,"I was looking for the ""Hockey song"" by Jughead.Couldn't find it by them.Found the same title on this album and decided, ""Hey! I can spot the 20 bucks: I'll get the funny ""Hockey Song"" I was looking for; I'll get introduced to a new Canadian folk artist!""Result?Wrong hockey song. Just a dud. Awful artist. Worse than a dud. This guy shouldn't even be allowed in the studio. Don't waste your money. This album is not good funny folk; good serious folk; good Canadian folk. It's just not good. Period."
4,If only I had this with my first...,"Definitely suggest this book to anyone with pre-teens...just to get prepared. I have a nearly 20 year old, a 15 year and a 10 year old and it will definitely be used with the 2 youngest."
2,Raising Teenagers,"This book had a minimal amount of plausible ideas in it. There were however a few points that could be used to motivate teens to cooperate with their parents, but as far as being ""Brilliant"" I feel that is a stretch."
5,Vibrant and sensual prose brings each step of the saga alive,"A Time To Reap is a spiritual, mystical novel of one woman's search for love, self-understanding, and fulfillment. The trials of three generations of women culminate in Maureen Manley's quest, and her journey leads her to rediscover her strength within. The vibrant and sensual prose brings each step of the saga alive to all five senses in this enthralling and uplifting story."
3,Rented Movie - Guzaarish,"Rented Movie - Guzaarish. Cost was reasonable, process to rent was straight forward. Video/Sound quality was alright, but I was expecting it to be very high definition. Overall no major complaints."
2,Weak Bushnell Instant Replay,"My review for the will be short and disappointed for the Bushnell Instant Replay 8x30 Binocular 5MP Camera.Pros: compact and light, binocular optics are good, video is of middle quality, added SD card capableCons: camera optics very poor, it is not a true through-the-lens camera though advertised as so, relies on a separate focus free separate camera for photos and video, very hard on rechargeable batteries (mine lasted only 9-10 minutes), and LCD screen is too small (which is needed for many adjustment settings during shooting) and easily wasted out in sun light.I cannot recommend this binocular and camera combo. I ended up sending it back, which the seller promptly refunded all but 10 percent of purchase price. I justified my return by stating, ""The item had too many negatives to justify the expense."""
1,Instant Disappointment,"I purchased these binoculars as a gift for my husband. We attend a lot of hockey games, and I thought he would get a kick out of the camera/video features. Right out of the box, it became clear that something was not quite right with the product. Only the second time we turned it on, the display indicated the (brand-new) batteries were low. Then, the whole thing started locking up, to the point that none of the buttons (including the power button) worked at all. We had to take out the batteries to get the thing to shut off. The product itself may have been defective, but based on the other reviews here, I will not be buying another set of these binoculars to replace the broken ones. I'm going with a different product next time."
1,Robin from Brooklyn NY,"I read all the reviews and they were right. The Technology is not perfected. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. I wanted to return it, but he wanted to keep it. He was just being nice. The camera doesn't take good pictures. I am not an expert but I do have eyes."
5,Great movie,"I had seen the movie years ago and wanted to share it with my wife. It arrived on time, new and we enjoyed it very much.Cost was a little high I thought but then, I could not find it anywhere else."
4,High Spirits,I love Peter O'Toole whether in this flick or How to Steal a Million he is one of the best English Actors. Darrel Hannah had a lot of fun in her role along with Beverly D'Angelo. A lot of silly fun.
4,Unknown classic,"I remember watching this movie as a kid, and it's still pretty funny. A lot of well known actors in this one, including a young and dashing Liam Neeson. It's not going to win any awards, but you're kept entertained in every scene. Special effects are '80s style but so what? Go ahead and watch and you'll wonder why you haven't watched it sooner."
3,Cute old school movie,It was a cute movie I had watched when I was young. I can't believe how far movie magicHas came in the past 20 years!
5,"Wonderful movie, I'm glad it is on DVD!",A lot of great 1980s movies are finding their way onto DVD lately. It makes my heart smile to see that a good DVD copy of High Sprits will help this movie live on through the ages. This movie is a wonderful comedy with some spooky twists. This one is a must see for ghost enthusiasts. A+
1,"The movies is a classic, but the quality of the video was awful.","I love this movie. It's one of my all time favorites. I was sorely disappointed by the quality. It skipped, stopped and I didn't get to finish watching it. :("
2,Soso,"I admit, I did not know what to think of the movie as I began to watch it. It is a light humored story about a group of people who live in a castle. The thing is, the castle is going under bankruptsy and the owners are trying to find a way to keep it. So they plan several events ""plays"" to make this castle haunted. A group of vacationers stay in the hotel to endure the fake gohsts and hauntings. But, as it turns out the castle is actually filled with real gohsts. So, I wouldn't watch this movie again on my own accord because it was kind of dumb. But it does spark a few laughs."
4,A prequel to it all...,"This book gives you the beginnings of J. Falkenbergs story....his first real commmand on an isolated backwater with a scratch BN of recruits and jailhouse refugees. You met for the first time many of his companions of the Legion and how they first begin to form the team he takes throughout the Galaxy. The battle scenes as usual are well written and cover the use of misinformation, small unit tactics and the inevitable politics of the CoDominion. A really good read."
3,Simply A Gift,"Quality was good, but not the stuff I read personally, it was a ""gag"" gift . What can I say except that it is Donald Goines."
1,"Ran good twice, now no support. Poor power quality.","Bought this at Walmart for $300. It started easily the first 2 months. A year later the carb is leaking gas when I open the fuel shutoff valve. I work on cars all the time and checked the usual items. It is the carb, not the hoses or clamps. I went on the Devilbiss website and it is not listed as a current model. They have nothing like it now. I'll buy a Honda next time. Update - still have it 2 yrs later, runs after lots of carb cleaner (run it dry, don't trust STABIL alone)...I now have problems with poor power quality, voltage swings, poor grounding even with ground rod, and no voltage to safety ground, only 105 volts from hot to neutral. I think it fried my refrigerator computer board - I won't use the generator anymore for anything electronic or valuable."
5,Greatest knight and vampire? It's possible.,"In the first book, Keeper of the King, the reader was introduced to Richard d'Orleans, who would become Lancelot of the Round table. Before that, he meets Sabra, the lady of the lake, who Takes him under her wing, so to speak, and makes him a vampire. Now It's 1990's Toronto, and he's still around. So how does the greatest Knight function as a vampire in modern times? Easy, he adapts. But when an old friend is threated, he must come to the rescue. That's what happens in this novel, His Father's son. Being the Knight in shining armor he was born, in both lives, to be. This story is handled with lots of suspense, trists and turns, and plenty of blood drinking. If you love a good vampire, who's romantic and funny at the same time, but also very vengeful, then here's the vampire for you."
5,Richard Rides Again,"This is the second novel from the Nigel Bennett / P. N. Elnod collaboration. The first being ""The Keeper of the King"" where the character Richard who bears a strong resemblance to Nigel Bennett is introduced. Fans of the ""Forever Knight"" tv series will recognize Bennett as LaCroix from the series. Although both characters are vampires, this is where the similarities end and this novel series is NOT a tie-in from the ""Forever Knight"" tv series as the reviewer from the Publishers Weekly incorrectly stated in his review.""His Father's Son"" appeals to the reader of many genres. It is an entertaining tale with a delightful mix of supernatural, Arthurian times, and mystery. There is plenty of romance, history, action, and vengeance to go around. The story takes the reader on an adventure from Arthurian Britain to modern day Toronto and Texas, while Richard confronts dilemmas from the past and present.I look forward to next and so will you."
5,The best pie crust on Earth!,"This is the best pie crust in the world. I have tried others but this one is just the best. I can't find it in the stores anymore so I get it on Amazon. When I can't buy it at all anymore, I'll do homemade because other pie crusts just don't cut it."
2,Not what I expected,"This set of Dansk Bistro Cafe flatware was not as heavy, nor were the knives the same size or shape as the other Dansk Bistro Cafe flatware that I own. I did not compare the forks or spoons with the set I already owned to see how they compare as the knives were enough to convince me that this set was not what I expected, and therefore, returned it."
1,Buyer beware---not as advertised,"I ordered this single for the extended album mix and the extended club mix, which are not on the domestic release featuring Janet and nelly on the cover. But THAT'S the single I received! I don't know if these alternate mixes actually exist. If anyone orders this and gets a single with this cover and these mixes, please post a review! Thanks."
4,My Best Friend Is A Vampire dvd,"My Best Friend is a Vampire (The Lost Collection)This is a teen comedy from 1988, starring Robert Sean Leonard and David Warner.Jeremy Capello (Robert Sean Warner) has a date with a difference..he becomes a vampire !But theres no carnage or brooding involved,is a sweet,funny and entertaining story,not to be taken too seriously.Well worth a look for an evening of light entertainment."
4,Definatly Not Your Typical Vampire Flick!,"The acting may not be top notch, and the cast isn't allstar, but the premise is cute...and pretty darn amusing. The soundtrack features songs by Timbuk3 and Blondie. I can't think of a good way to describe the film, so you should see it for yourself."
4,"Super Cheesy, but love it!","If you remember this movie from 1988, it's just as good (and bad) as it was then! If you are new to the movie, then sit back, relax and enjoy this 80's version of what it means to be a teenage vampire..."
3,enjoyable,A comedic movie about vampires. Where a teen in bitten by a vampire while bringing her her groceries. And in the comdic way we find him reacting towards his new life.
4,Mindless entertainment,There is nothing really great about this movie.Yet I find myself watching it over and over.It is paced perfectly and never gets slow.Overall it is a good teen comedy that does not takevampires seriously.If you were a teen in the 80's it is evenmore funny to watch this movie.I would wait for a dvd version.
3,"Good, but far from reality!","it is a very, fun and WEIRD film. Would i see it again? Yes but only is i was 9 years old!"
1,NO !!!!,"I have waited for years for this movie to come out. I love it,....but fullscreen ? Does Lionsgate seriously think that we're that dumb that we'll accept fullscreen ? Even if we don't have a widescreen tv, we can still watch widescreen movies....that is, those of us that have more than two brain cells watch widescreen and hate fullscreen. They only time that fullscreen is acceptable is if it's an old tv show or pre-50s movie when widescreen wasn't invented yet. *blows raspberry*"
2,good story but bad come out,"this is an interesting story but it sorta blows out awhile in the run in. Robert Sean Leonard is a great pic as Jeremy Capello but the other supportees like his parents and Rene Auberjoinis(Star Treak DSN fame), that fat guy and David Herman(Ninja Turtles: The Secret Of The Ooze) sorta downwash his performance, but luckily his friend played by Evan Mirand(Fight Club) helps this movie along the way. Cheryl Pollack(Pump Up The Volume) also starts, and what the hell happened to her anyway, I dont see her in movies lately, that is a bummer because she is hot. good 80's music and some good atmosphere also boost it up one star. just dont find some logic in here"
2,Product not as described,"This product says it has 8 watts output so it can power devices that require 8 watts but it is a standard USB charger that does not output enough power to charge a device requiring an 8 watt charger.When I connect it to my Motorola Xyboard it says ""slow charging rate"" because it is not putting out the stated power, and if I use the tablet in the car the battery level actually goes down while the charger is plugged in and operating."
1,Too much engineering terminology...,"This book has some good info, but it requires a lot more explaining. It tells you how, but not why? Like, why should i use this book? I should good ahead and enroll in some courses @ Georgia Tech. Every example given has a pro...then, a con to CONTRADICT the pro. I didn't feel like i could use any of the info."
1,Misleading Title,"The title may be ""Chassis Engineering"", but this is really just another suspension tuning book, with almost no real information about vehicle chassis (frame and frame reinforcing). I purchased this book looking for something about reinforcing the frame of a unibody vehicle, and found that the first 85 pages and last 36 pages are the same shock, spring, aerodynamic, and weight distribution stuff as every other suspension tuning written in the last 25 years, basically rephrasing everything from Fred Phun's ""How to Make Your Car Handle"" (1981) (And Mr. Phun presents the material a lot better). There are only 12 pages about the ""chassis"" or non-moving parts of the vehicle, and those really present the subject with such lack of detail and depth that anyone beyond the age of about 10 is going to be disappointed and feel talked down to. I suppose the good news is that it was only $12, which minimizes the waste of money."
2,Save your money,"Book goes over a lot of information in a very short time, but not much of that information is worth anything unless you're building a circle-track or drag car. Took the hit and ordered Stanforth's Competition Car Suspension."
2,Not for engineers,"Maybe it's a good book for the Nascar and other North American race car fans to know how those cars are tunned, but it is not really a Chasss Engineering reference book."
4,Chassis basics,"The book is very easy to read. You can improve your car suspension, it's explain all about that.The chapter about frames is good, you can understand all aspect to stiffness and strength of the chassis, and you can design you handling chassis using a model.Es un libro de fácil lectura, explica los aspectos básicos de las suspensiones de vehículos.Es posible mejorar e incluso diseñar una suspensión. Explica como medir la resistencia torsional de los chasis y como mejorarla.Explica como mejorar la maniobrabilidad (handling) de un vehículo."
4,A good balance between theory and practice.,A good book that has an excellent blend of the theory AND practice of the subject. I particularly liked the worked examples and the fact that it gave actual values to the concepts discussed. The diagrams and explanations are clear and easy to understand. The book is not too race oriented but also very applicable to those wanting to make their road cars handle better.Two (small) criticisms: 1. Far too much space is given to the characterisrics and setting up of circle track cars ( left/right turn only ) which cannot be of general interest. 2. Pictures are included that do not add to the content in any way.
2,solid rear axle only,This book is useless for anything other than info about setting up solid rear axle systems. everything else in this book is either incomplete or filled with editing errors. A whole book about chassis engineering etc that at no point whatsoever mentions Ackerman angle is unbelievable. Mr. Adams says that to find the C of G position is difficult so he doesnt tell us how he tells us to assume where it is based on other cars hhhmmm Then how come in race and rally car source book mr staniforth explains how in less than a page. Save your money or buy staniforths book and see how its really done
3,Not what you would expect,"I recently purchased this book and have read it twice from front to back. It had a lot of good solid information, however the title is decieving in the fact that it has the word ""engineering"" in it. This book touches lightly on the subject of engineering, however it stops there. This book is mainly designed for those with Camaros or Corvettes and doesnt really give much information regarding independent suspensions or anything else besides what may be found on those two vehicles. I am by no means an engineer but I do know a thing or two about mechanics and this book does not help me to understand the complete dynamics involved in a vehicle chassis. It barely goes into detail about shocks or springs and the only information that seems relevant to that is ""How to cut your springs"". This book is written more for the back-yard mechanic than for the aspiring automotive engineer."
4,Good for the non-engineer,"Chassis Engineering, by Herb Adams is a great primer. When I bought the book it was exactly what I needed. Not too theoretical, more on practical. There are many rules-of-thumb that I thought were very helpful in guiding my decisions. The book provided me with about 80% of what I need to know about designing my own suspension. Don't expect everything from this book, it's the size a magazine. I was perfect for me, however, as I knew very little about the subject and I didn't want to get bored learning from a 400 page textbook. Very high recommendation for $14."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I've really enjoyed this series and was anxious to read the latest installment. What a disappointment.The plot was extremely confusing and uneven. It seemed to flop back and forth between two separate crimes and a totally unrelated situation while attempting to tie all them together...of which the author did a very poor job. And the conclusion was very lame, being we knew nothing about the person and had no reason to care about them. None of the characters were well-developed, including the ones we've met before in previous installments. I finished the book last night, and I'm still trying to put together in my mind all the pieces in this jumbled mess.I do recommend this series, but don't start with this one...and don't worry about skipping it entirely."
3,The worst Jaw rip of ever made.,"This movie is okey it lack some stuff. One the shark is way to big and when you she it does not look realistic. The younger version of then Megladon that kills the main characters parents at the begining looks real. But the adult Megladon looks fake. She is like 2 time the size of the Shark in Jaws 3.This movie reminds me of the Original little shop of Horrors because it has and awful ending. If you want to she some Jaws rip of I recomend Shark attack 1 2 and 3 Red Water, Creature. The best of the Jaws rip off was deep blue sea. I have not watche dit in a while. I plan on purchising the dvd version off it."
1,Don't Waist Your Time!!,"This is one of the worst movies ever. It is just all around boring and the ideas are old. It is very low budget, so the specials effects are very bad. The DVD has no special features or sound options. You can only watch it in stereo sound (no 5.1) This movie is a waist of time and money."
1,Don't even go there,so in the end nobody knows what happends and nobody knows about the huge shark!Come on people cant you do anything better!If I could I would feed the cast and crew to the shark if they had acually convinced me that this was a movie!There should have been a love story in it that didn't end in both of them dying!
1,what next?,"what happends next, all of them died! EVEN THE MAGLADON! If I could I'd give movie no stars.I would like to take the movie and play pin the mivie on the fat ass!"
3,SOOOO much better than Shark Attack 3!,"Finally an actor I recognize! ASJ from General Hospital fame. Well. This is SOO much easier to follow and higher budget than that ""other"" megalodon movie(SA 3) ! There was plenty of shark footage and arguments over whether to kill it or study it. Well, getting it back to study it before it kills them is the problem. I did not have high expectations for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The ending wasn't the happiest greatest idea in the world, but Deep Blue Sea had a stupid ending too.Don't forget a new Meg movie out this July. If you want to avoid other bad shark movies, steer clear of Red Water. Yes, I know it's about a bullshark, but the movie is really hardly about the bullshark. see my review."
1,Really a 5 Marianas Trench film,"This odd apparently joint Bulgarian-US production is quite astonishingly bad. It has all the appearance of being an attempt to cash in on the forthcoming film of the novel ""Meg"", also based on the idea of the survival of the very large prehistoric shark Carachodon Megalodon in the deepest depths of the ocean (imagine a semi-trailer full of teeth where the driver usually sits and you have the general idea). Poor plot, bad acting, terrible visual effects and a joke of a shark. What more could one not want?"
2,A little different,This is a lot different from Deep Blue Sea or Shark Attack. I sort of liked the way that the shark just floated around the underwater base like a dirgible. The computer effects are better then many similar films but you don't see as much. If you like this kind of movie you should check this out once with the fast forward nearby. It's nice to see a pessimistic ending for a change.
3,COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL IT JUST DOESN'T CUT !,"Film director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson have returned to the screen again to create a sequel to the most successful horror film of all time. This being a sequel, Williamson includes a scene where film students discuss the fact that sequels never quite match the inventiveness of the original - quite true. To be fair No.2 does avoid a few obvious pitfalls, by concentrating on the victim and not the demonic killer/s, and ensuring that all of the characters have in some way moved on. However the plot does not move on, instead it is stuck in a repetitive cycle, where, despite a few clever twists and turns, we pretty much know what's coming. Compared to contemporary horror - fare this is intelligent and frightening, but compared to the original it just doesn't cut it."
4,Package Deal,I thought it was great that when ordering this product it brought up similar DVD's that I would be interested in that could be bought as a package deal! Also shipped as soon as it was available ahead of other items!
4,Just as I ordered,"Good price for this Blu-ray; ordered it for my teenage son for Valentine's Day and he was very pleased. Fast shipping.....Amazon is good for ""discreet"" shipping so that no one knows what the package contains which was helpful with this item since it was a gift for someone in the same household."
3,Very Good Audio / Video Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I am writing the same review for Scream, Scream 2, and Scream 3.These movies all have a 2.35:1 (or 2.40:1) aspect ratio. The video quality of these movies is very good to great. I rate it about 9.3 on a 10.0 scale (I have never rated a Blu-Ray below 4.0).All 3 movies have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is adequate to very good.I thought the movies were okay, but not great. I don't know if I am going to ever watch them again - I may sell them."
1,Not Worth A Sigh,"I started watching this psudo-horror flick the other night and turned it off after about 45 minutes. Completely unoriginal (so called) horror courtesy of Hollywood. What ever happened to real horror flicks! This movie was about as dull and prosaic as can be expected from a sequel. If you truly want to be terrified, rent or buy the Evil Dead. Now that's a classic, low-budget or not."
1,Not good,"This movie isn't worth watching a second time. This movie was predictable and didn't have to be made in the first place becuase it was just like the first one with different characters, Its not a well done movie"
1,unnecessary,"The first one was bad enough, but they had to make a second one. Too violent, too freaky, and too disgusting. Only good point is seeing Neve Campbell get hurt."
1,not as good as people say,"I think that this movie is not that good, its one of the most overrated movies I have seen."
4,Scream 2:better than the first,"Scream 2 is far better than the first Scream because the movie is more in depth into Sidney's life and Gale and Dewey's romance. Yes of course there is a killer running loose and killing everyone in sight and we try so hard to guess who that killer is, but once again, the killer is usually someone who we don't guess. I do hope that Scream 3 is better than Scream 2, so that way the trilogy is a classic horror hit."
4,More of the same but still entertaining,"Scream 2 is not as good the original but atleast Willliamson and Craven are intelligent enough to acknowledge that few to no films surpass the original . The intelligent commentary on horror films is still used but the film has a less original plot. Despite this, I still found the film very entertaining."
4,"It was okay, but Scream was better","The plot to Scream 2 was pretty good, but could have been better. I liked how they throw Cotton as a suspect for the killer and how he got put in jail for being accused for the murder of Cindy's mother's death. The reason I gave this DVD a ""3"" is because it's not as scary as the original, the sequel is never better than the original. I also like how the boyfriend isn't the killer. The only bad thing about all the Scream movies is that the killer knows Cindy. But over all it was a good scary movie."
5,Action Packed Sequel Lived Up to the First One,"I'm amazed at how great this movie was. We know that Billy is dead but another copycat shows up right after the premire of Stab which was about the original Scream. It introduced Cotton Weary the man who went to jail for murdering Sidney's mother. He was to eager to get his fifteen minutes of fame. Also back was Dewey, Gail, and Randy. I was suprised that Dewey didn't bring up the fact that his sister was dead. I liked Randy a lot because he knew a lot about horror movies but sadly he died. Dewey really can take a punch I thought he had died in the first one. Gail really changed and she started caring about other people for a change. This movie was great and it is a must see for all horror fans."
3,WORKED OUT A LOT BETTER THAN MOST OTHER HORROR SEQUELS,"VERY SHORTLY AFTER ''STAB'', A MOVIE ABOUT THE KILLING SPREE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FIRST MOVIE, IS RELEASED IN THEATERS, A COPYCAT KILLER CONTINUES THE RAMPAGE. BETTER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT OMAR EPPS AND JADA PINKETT SMITH COULD'VE USED A LOT MORE SCREEN TIME THAN WHAT THEY GOT. CAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WERE THE FIRST TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED. THIS MOVIE BENEFITS FROM NEVE CAMPBELL, WHO RETURNS AS SIDNEY. IT'S AN OK SEQUEL. IT SHOULD PLEASE FANS OF THE ORIGINAL, ALTHOUGH IT RUNS OUT OF STEAM TOWARD THE END."
1,Not a horror movie,Just another slasher flick attempting to be hip. It will probably appeal the most to people who think that talentless 'hotties' from 'Party of Five' or '90210' can act.This is NOT a horror movie. Horror movies have the elements of suspense and the supernatural. Watch movies with Vincent Price or Christopher Lee if you want to see horror movies. Scream2 is devoid of suspense or acting talent.
2,ahahahah,"so bad it's funny, no punch at all ahahahahahaha i cant believe it wow. so so so bad it's so so so so so funny"
2,THIS ISN'T WORTHY!,"A really bad sequel. Do not rent this, you will only waste money. The acting is horrendous."
3,The Sequel,"Scream 2 could of been better. It was not as good as the orignal, and it is not as good as Scream 3. Of course it was very predictable. Scream 3 is the best Scream sequel, Scream 3 is funny, scary, and completely different form the first two. Scream 2 could of been better."
3,Not as good as the first. But then what horror sequel is?,"Scream 2, released one year after it's predecessor was a film in great anticipation. The target audience the teenagers, got what they wanted to see. This film is full of scares, with plenty of humour and plenty of nailbiting moments, the car scene with Sidney and her friend to name but a few. Written once again by Kevin Williamson the story takes place 2 years after the murders began. Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now in college and trying to put her life behind her. The other survivors are also with her. With the production of the new movie Stab... a killer is once again on the loose trying to make some sort of sequel to it... to kill once again. Only question is...who is it this time? With loads of suspects Williamson keeps us guessing. A great film followed by a disapointing end... but I won't spoil that for you."
4,good sequel,"A good sequel. Rare ""good, almost better, than the original"" sequels. Fun. Score: 97/100"
4,3.5 Stars,"Wow, this is a shock, this one is actually better than the first! Fully aware of its status as the sequel to the surprise hit thriller of 1996, this lively follow-up trades freshness for familiarity, playing on our affection for returning characters while obeying--and then subverting--the ""rules"" of sequels. Once again, movie references are cleverly employed to draw us into the story, which takes place two years after the events of Scream, at a small Ohio college, where the Scream survivors reunite when another series of mysterious killings begins. Scream 2 does a lot better job in hiding the killer, and has a few good jolts, and has what the first film didn't have...SUSPENSE! I now have respect for this movie series, and I will see the third one. This one has a great story, great acting, and a smart killer, all of wich the first one didn't have, so see the first one then see the next one, wich is even better!"
3,"Better, but not good","After ""Scream,"" it is impossible to make the sequel any worse. And, the sequel is an improvement, but still not good. All of the no-talents from the original are back, along with some new no-talents, to make this movie better. But, some of the scenes in the movie are so predictable is just made me angry. ""He's not here!"" screams Neve. ""What?"" screams her friend, standing 100 feet away, next to a dark alley. You do the math. But some scenes were intense, like the escape from the car. But other than that and some plot twists, this movie is still not scary. Buy ""Halloween"" for some true horror."
2,The Most Awful Ending Ever Filmed,"Aside from a suspenseful sequence with Courtney Cox trapped in a recording studio, this movie is just terrible. Jerry O'Connell tries valiantly, and Courtney and David are fun to watch together, but this sequel forgets that it isn't satire if it's just as bad as the thing it's satirizing (like.. oh.. Friday the 13th Part 5). But worst of all is the ending: beyond stupid, it drags and drags and drags... how can any of the fans of this movie bear to sit through yet another LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG ""Why I had to do it"" explanation by the killers? It's not funny, it's just plain BAD."
2,"Sequels DO stink, but this ain't too bad","This sequel to the 1997 slasher/thriller has some scares and the end is perfect. However, since the first one was so good, I expected this movie to be a little bit better, but hey! it's good. Campbell is a little less convincing, but Cox is getting more convincing. The plot cooks up in many parts, but as scary as it was, I didn't jump once. On a final note, the movie was somewhat predictable. From a scale of 1 to 10, a 3."
1,This movie sucks,"When this movie came out in theatres, I made my dad go out so Icould rent SCREAM 1. I loved it. So I was really anxious to see SCREAM 2.I wanted to see something scary and funny like in the first one. The beginning was good and scary, but then the whole movie sucked after that. I didn't laugh ONCE in this whole damn movie! The only good thing about it is that MASTER P & SILKK song on the soundtrack."
2,This Movie Is The Worst Sequel I Have Ever Seen,Scream was a fantastic movie by itself. Scream 2 was so corny. I mean..the movie was good until the end when you find out who the killer is. The end was a disappointment. This movie had some funny parts in it. You can't help but laugh at Dewey..he's so funny! But it still wasn't as good as the first Scream. I saw it with my sister and cousin in a theater and the whole time i just kept rolling my eyes at some of the stupid parts they put in there. It's a shame they spent money making this film. The original movie *Scream* would have been just fine without it.
2,BOORRRRRRRRINNNNNNNNGGGGG!,"Just like the original, the first 15 minutes are great. Then .... the rest of the movie has to start. Just another boring slasher movie with no real plot or developed characters. The 2 stars are for the first 15 minutes."
2,no more sequels,"this movie wasn't nearly as good as the first one, which wasn't scary either. it was more of a comedy than a horror movie. neither of them compare to I Know What You Did Last Summer."
2,I think STAB would have been better,"Campbell and friends are in college and trying to get on with their lives when a kopy kat killer strikes. A totally unnecessary sequel with repugnant jokes, dead laughs, and what has to be the worst musical performance by an actor in all of film history! Some good suspenseful moments and an improvemence by Cox make it better. The sorority twits are kind of funny too."
2,Totally 70s,"This is the sequel to the classic 1996 hit that parodied the cliches of slasher horror films. A typical updated slasher film, yet the brilliance lies in parodying that which it is, a chessey slasher film on a low budget. David Arqutte is a Clive Barker look alike. I gave it two stars because my tastes have changed since I was the geek rooting on the killer. At one dollar, you can't go wrong for cheap slasher flicks, except it lacks the drive in aura of Halloween or even the classic icons of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. As a straight slasher film series, this would be great, instead it's poking fun at the slasher film cliches. A joke it is."
2,"I Only Saw It Once, And....","THAT WAS ENOUGH. I was actually expecting something out of this movie. I guess I was wrong. The final identity of the killer wasn't very surprising at all because it's not noticed that they are revealed somewhere in the middle of the film. I'm glad some of the people who died, died. {Many of them deserved it anyway}. I can't remember the plot, but it wasn't all that great to me. A few scenes were alright, but overall, this just does not make my day."
2,Still the same recipe that the public eats blindly...,"Scream 2 is the SAME THING than the first one. Same plot, same stupid actors, same boring directing and same conclusion. Frankly, this is one huge mistake of cinema industry. When I say the same thing, it's the SAME THING! Some parts are so unrealistic that I was laughing...the characters are dumb and the worst mistake they made in this sequel is that they killed the only interesting character: Randy. You can still see some not-so graphic bloody images, and the killer wearing the same suit. Watching these cute little teenagers getting stabbed in the back isn't very entertaining, but, maybe it's just me, but they made a lot of money with this film...and that's a mistake. The whole thing is a mistake...and it seems that they don't understand that, because they made a third episode...4/10"
5,really good but a little unrealistic! i enjoyed it,i thought that it was almost better than scream but it was quite unrealistic and the end was not as good as screams. .I recommend it but not if you haven't had the chance to see scream yet!
4,Not as Scary as Scream but the suspense is killer.,"I thought Scream 2 was an excellent film, though it did lack the scariness of the first but not the suspense. In all actuality it was more suspenseful, Kevin did a great job with this movie. I knew it wouldn't be as scary as the first, movies can rarely b; but it sure keeps you on the edge of your seat till the exciting conclusion. A definite must have for those of you who love a good thrill ride, and you Scream fans."
5,Even better then the first Scream!!!!,Scream 2 was fantastic! I personally liked it way better than the first one. The only thing lacking was Skeet Ulrich. Boo HOO! Still it was exceptional and I love Neve Campbell and David Arquette and especially Jamie Kennedy! They work wonderfully as a cast. A truly funny and scary horror movie definitely one for the home library. I just hope that a Scream 3 comes out quickly.
3,THIS WAS BORING AND NOT AS GREAT AS SCREAM,"This was exacatly the same as scream but less blood and not as off the edge as scream.I heard that their going to make scream 3 but why?Are they going to turn this into a series of screams like they did with halloween?This gets really boring after a while.I hope scream 3 is way better than scream 2.I think anyone who will watch the same thing over and over again should see this,but if your in for a more exciting film wait untill the summer thats when the good ones come out."
2,KICKING A DEAD HORSE?,"Some films, sequels particularly, can be overdone. The sequel to Scream is not really bad, but it is not really great either. It does not equal the originality of its predecessor nor does it really provide the same sense of urgency of the first film. In addition, the characters are not quite as interesting this time. When an original premise is overworked, we are left with what could be considered cinematic leftovers, so to speak. Meatloaf, anyone? The only really interesting parts here are the over the top performance of Laurie Metcalf and also the performance of Liev Schreiber."
4,"Scream 2 is GREAT,- but not as original as first.","Scream 2, starring Neve Campbell (like usual), David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and featuring cameos by modern 'Scream-Queen' Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, and more... is a great modern, '90s horror flick (although it's not exactly really terrifying), and has an EXCELLENT cast, - but Scream 2 just doesn't have that exciting, original, and fun feeling that the first one is filled with. The third Scream is better than this one I thought, (although it is even less scary than this one), but the first one remains at the top! See Scream today, - it is a great, fun film to see at sleep-overs, parties, etc. - But do not be in any rush to see Scream 2."
3,A REPEAT OF THE ORIGANAL,"Basically a complete repeat of the origanal but far less scary, totally predictable and often more unintentionally funny than frightening as intended to be. Entertaining is the best way to sum this film up as it does have its moment along the way but basically a rather pale reflection of the origanal. Scripts are overly melodramatic and quite often just plain silly but performances are acceptable. Worth a look. Recommended."
3,"Funny and ""scary"" for teenagers","I don't know how I've watched it twice! Well, my friends forced me doing so. At least the film is better than I Know What You Did Last Summer (yes, I saw it. I feel guilty, ok?)- which will probably follow with the sequences I Still Keep Knowing Ever and Allways What You Did Last Summer - but which film isn't, right?I've enjoyed Scream, The First, it was a good film, but this one, please! It has, as the tipical teenage movies of the 90's, cinical jokes while they are getting thriled by a psycho. I know the film isn't supposed to be taken seriously, neither did I have this kind of thought, but it's too foolish, predictable and boring - but that's my opinion!If you like Armaggedon and The Bone Collector - brainless and trashy movies in general - GO WATCH IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT! For the few others who don't match with them, stay REALLLY away from it, as I think you have already known."
3,"Good, not great","I waited months for this movie. I counted down the days to opening, and when I saw it on that opening day I left the theater wondering why I even bothered anticipating it. Don't get me wrong this is better than such recent horror flicks as ""Idle Hands"" and ""The Haunting"" and was a better sequel than ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"", which had an even worse ending than this one, but it just didn't live up to the name ""Scream"". If you liked the first, get this one, but don't expect the level of its predecessor."
3,A fairly decent sequel!,3 1/2 stars. Though not as good as the original this still is a very decent sequel. The story now takes place at Sidney's college where many of her companions are killed by a copycat killer. Who could this be we all ask? Well I suggest you rent or buy this film and enjoy. I must say though the ending kind of dissapointed me but that's not to say that this movie is bad it still has the suspense of not knowing who's the killer. Above Average compared to most sequels.
3,Another scream. 15th april 2004.,"If you have seen the first and not the second, you would probably prefer the 1st, it is way better than scream 2."
3,Actually better than the first film,"More violent and character driven than the first film, Scream 2 manages to improve on most of the first film's short comings, but is still only an average horror/thriller. Picking up where the first film left off, a familiar ghost faced killer is stalking Sidney (Neve Campbell) once again, and the film also features returning cast members Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schrieber. Scream 2 is full of tense moments and plot twists galore, but a majority of the film has a ""I've seen this before and I've seen this done better"" feel to it. Released only a year after the first film, Scream 2 was a smash hit like the original, and like the original, helped spawn a never ending wave of trendy teeniebopper horror films that just about all failed to impress. The rest of the cast includes Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett, Jerry o' Connell, Laurie Metcalf, and Timothy Olyphant; most of whom give memorable performances."
5,Run Cici run!,"This movie was great, i belive it was the best of the series. They brought in my obsession, Sarah Michelle Gellar to play the roll Cici Cooper. She was great, but i cried wen she died... :( hehehe. Courtny Cox and Neve Camble were funny too! if you love seeing the best scream queens (like SMG) run rampid, then go out and buy Scream 2!"
5,Cool movie...,"The same plot... sorta.. Syd goes to college, and there's a whole lot of blood and gore. Just as good, possibly better than ""Scream""... Really cool ending, too. Everything about this movie is extremely well done. I can't wait to see ""Scream 3""!"
3,"Good Movie, Poor DVD Package","We look at the recently released Cruel Intentions and we have about four hours worth of goodies. Deleted scenes, director commentary, music videos - the whole megillah.We look at Scream 2 and we have color and widescreen. Oh Joy. I know for a fact that there are some deleted scenes running around (a lot of magazines that have promoted both Scream 2 and 3 have pictures of another scene involving Cici and the other sorority sisters).Anyway, I saw this DVD at a friends house and I can guarentee I won't be buying it until there are some nicer extras on it."
5,Did you SCREAM again?,"A worthy sequel with another twist ending. Now SCREAM 3 is on the way, I'm hoping that, that one will be as entertaining if not more so."
4,best sequel I've ever seen,This is one of my most favorite scream in the whole series.The 1st time I saw this I loved it.It was better than the 1st one.I say its better than Halloween.So if your reading this you should bye it.
4,"Scream 2 is GREAT,- but not as original as first.","Scream 2, starring Neve Campbell (like usual), David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and featuring cameos by modern 'Scream-Queen' Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, and more... is a great modern, '90s horror flick (although it's not exactly really terrifying), and has an EXCELLENT cast, - but Scream 2 just doesn't have that exciting, original, fun , and chilling feeling that the first one is filled with. The third Scream is better than this one I thought, (although it is even less scary than this one), but the first one remains at the top! See Scream today, - it is a great, fun film to see at sleep-overs, parties, etc. - But do not be in any rush to see Scream 2."
4,A decent sequel that is entertaining and gradifing,"This is not has good has Scream and the first 2 Halloweens but is still entertaining. i didn't like how gory it was compared to # uno but not has bad has your jasons, freddies, and later michael myers.I would have gave it ***** if it wasn't for the lack of interest williamson put in to it and the fact my favorite character died. But it still tightly bounds the orginial characters and newcharacters that made the orginal scream a classic."
5,What's Your Favourite Scary Movie ??? SCREAM 2,"100% scarier, 100% gorier, 100% cleverier, 100% Sexier, 100% funnier, what else can I say, Scream 2 is 100% better than any film I've ever seen END"
5,Scream 2 rocked,"Scream 2 was just as amazing as the first one! It had just as much suspence and was increadibly scary. If you are getting a movie, then this is the one to get! END"
3,An Improvement,"I think Scream 2 was a great improvement from Scream. It had more suspense. It was formatted well, and the death scenes were more detailed. And Sidney was tougher. This movie certainly showed it's first OFF!"
4,very good characters and diffrent happenings,Scream 2 was really good but the problem is too many people died in this one its very thrilling jada pinkett could of died in the third one bucuz sideney [ neve campbell] has only jada pinkett her friend and needs more funny stuff lot of horror movies these days need comedy or laughter these days so i think the movie is good to go :)
1,BAD ACTING + BAD PLOT = SCREAM 2 THAT'S FOR SURE!!!,I saw SCREAM 2 and I hoped it might be better than the original how wrong I was. NEVE CAMPBELL and the rest of the cast act like a bunch of novice'es in this movie plus you can guess who the killer is early on. So my advice is avoid SCREAM 2 you won't soon regret it.
1,BORING,"Exactly like the fist. Recycled dialogue to match the word SEQUEL instead of SCARY MOVIE. JAMIE KENNEDY shouldn't have died. And why for the love of God, Allah and the Winds Willing to they NEVER get TEENS to play teens. This always ruins it for me no matter what the content of the film."
1,Yuck!,"You remember the saying about movie sequels, don't you? That they are never as good as the first one? Well, that is an understatement in the case of this sorry excuse of a movie. Maybe my expectations were way too high after the first Scream, which I loved, I don't know. But take my advice and don't bother with this stinker."
1,Typical trendyass Kevin Willamson movie,Neither Scream 1 or 2 are true to the horror genre but they do help to defile it. Watching this movie for free wouldn't even be worth it.
4,Sidney returns to find another set of copycat murders.,"""Scream 2"" is defintely not the original but it holds its own among horror films. This time around the story revolves more around the rules. Althought this sequel is much of the same and it pulls out and throws some unexpected twists and turns, that will make anyone scream. Neve Campbell is the main attraction to this movie and Kevin Willamsom's storyline, that is once again great."
3,"""Scream 2"" is better than the first one","What makes it so much better than the first is the story, and it is not cheazy like the first. Possibly the reason why I liked it is because, Sara Michelle Gellar is in it. Don't worry Neve & Courtney, because I happen to be a fan of you two also."
3,Okay,"As far as sequels go, this movie was okay, but it was not nearly as good as the original. Hollywood should stop making sequels and give audiences what they hunger for, more originals."
1,la luz,Je n'ai pas vu ce film mais je pense qu'il est pourri sauf peut etre l'actrice qui est physiquement bonne.
1,Yaaaaawn 2,"Neat, Scream 2 is out. Better go watch it then I thought and went to a cinema to see it. About 2 hours later I came out, stunned. Not by the quality of the movie though, but rather by the lack of it. This movie is soooo boring. It's not scary either. How can it be when its so predictable to tell where the killer is (""Hellooooo. I'm in the closet. La, la, la"") If this girl in the seat next to me hadn't screamed her guts out I would most likely have gone into a deep sleep."
2,Scream 2 Practically a Duplicate,"Scream 2 was almost the same thing as it's first. The usual:mystery phone calls, blood, gore, etc. This time Sydney Presscott (Neve Campbell) is in Windsor Collage and suddenly it starts again in the patern in Woodsboro California.See Scream 1 before Scream 2 because you wont get it."
4,love a good mystery/horror story!,"i watched the first scream movie awhile back and thought,""i need to see what happens in the sequel!"" In scream 2, a new set of murders are being played out at local college based on the fictionial movie 'Stab',which is the basis of the first set of murders in woodboro. sydney from the first movie goes to school there to start fresh after learning that her boyfriend and another friend killed her mom(they might've raped her or made it appear she was raped), framed her mom's lover cotton weary, savagely murdered their friends, including their principle and a camera man. oh, they kidnapped her dad in attempt to frame him for their crimes. but now, a new killer is taking up the ghostface mantle. who is the killer this time around? i not saying anything but all i can say is watch it from beginning to end."
3,Could Take it or Leave it,"Personally, I thought that Scream 2 was NOTHING in comparison to the orginal SCREAM.The first Scream was clever,entertaining and had humor in the right places.This Scream I thought was pretty cheesy with the jokes, the script and the acting. It almost seemed to be mocking the original movie.You never really got to know the characters in this movie so you felt nothing through all of the ""tense"" scenes.They could have done a great job with this movie but it just turned out to be pretty mediocre.If you're even a little critical of movies then you probably shouldn't watch this.Though I gotta give them credit for the slight twist at the end."
3,could of been better,After the sucess of Scream i bought scream 2 straight away as it went on dvd.It wasnt as exciting as the first.I think it could of been better.Its not scary and like it says on the front cover its not gory or funny.The worst of the trilogy.
3,"More scream, less theme","Just as they did in the first film, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson have some witty, metacognitive fun with the conventions of the horror genre in this tale of survivors from the original ""Scream"" facing off against a copycat. Points made include how African Americans are thought to have a more realistic responses to horror situations yet are always among the first characters to die, the need for sequels to be gorier than originals, and the commercialization and packaging of spectacular cases of real-world violence. Unfortunately, the rule most effectively dramatized is the one that tells us that sequels are never as good as the original. All of the wit is packed into the first 40% of the film. By the time we get to the end, it has degenerated into a lot of running and stabbing and pointless plot twists."
3,"Average sequel. Exciting, but lacks the richness of Scream.","Maybe a good sequel, but Scream 2 was very mediocre. I mean, it has good thrills but it didn't raise the bar any higher, which is expected in a sequel. I have a few good things to say. The suprise ending was really chilling. The characters seemed to deepen more than in the original. Overall the death scenes were pretty fresh and new, but they weren't as nail biting as the first. It was predictable, and mediocre. See it if you are a fan of the trilogy, and definately do not see it if you hate sequels."
2,Don't waste your money.,"I was a big fan of the first Scream movie - and consequently, Kevin Williamson. However, with this and other projects like Dawson's Creek, he's proved himself what he really is ... This movie is just a retread of the first film, except what works there doesn't work here. Williamson's writing has the feeling of an intro creative writing workshop. Much has been made about his young characters being too smart - in actuality, they're exceptionally dumb...they just have a thesaurus. In Scream he found a gimmick, in Scream 2 he's beating a dead slasher."
1,What is a collector,"Not a review as such more of an observation.having bought Scream 2 already and the box set what on earth is there to get now. Surely a collector is the person who buys the movie when it first hits the stores ? Maybe not - maybe a collector means they know you will buy the same film again and again and can keep releasing different editions. Maybe that's why I now have two copies of Seven , terminator 2, Scream (trilogy ) and the Exorcist... naughty naughty"
2,Disappointing sequel lacks the style of Scream I,"Sidney is back, and being persecuted again. The best thing in this film is the opening sequence starring the fabulous Jada Pinkett. From there however, the film goes steadily downhill. Even Rebecca Gayheart can't save this one. One of the main problems I had with the film, was the casting of Sidney's boyfriend. He is completely unlikeable fratish jockish dull, I could go on. His character is completely unlikeable. The killings are more elaborate, yes. But the film goes on TOO long, and the play within the movie really sucked and just detracted from the film. There are a few tense moments, such as when Gail Weathers is being chased by the killer, but overall, not much tension. I won't reveal the end, but believe me the identity of the killer this time is completely ridiculous. A weak effort overall."
4,FOR A SEQUEL THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE.,"MOST SEQUELS DON'T MEASURE UP TO THE ORIGINAL, BUT THIS ONE IS ACUTALLY VERY GOOD. IT PICKS UP A FEW YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ONE ENDS WITH NEVE CAMPBELL BACK WITH DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTNEY COX. THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SCARY MOVIE?"
3,What were they thinking?,"All I have to say about the ending of this movie is WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING? I am a true Scream fan! I loved the first movie, it was like a wake up call to horror flicks, and it began this chain of new comers such as I know what you did last summer. But really, I loved Jerry O'connels singing scene, but umm where do they get off throwing details every which way. Don't get me wrong though, i loved this movie, but only because i love like every horror movie, all i'm saying is the ending is a bit cheesey and they could've spared us all the ""Why did you do it?"" details."
3,"You need to see this movie, if only for","The whole Sequels are worse than the original thread running through the movie. Also there are several very funny parts if you saw Scream.The movie is scary, a decent slasher flick, but the best part of this movie is that it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Now it's nowhere near as good as _Army of Darkness_ which is the ultimate self-mocking horror movie, but it is still quite good."
2,A little better than the first.,"The screeneplay actually is not quite childish like in the first, and the directing of the film is better. If anything is watchable in this film it might as well be the acting or the gory special effects. I saw this one in a dollar theater, and no one there was scared that I know of, but like I said slasher films I not meant to be scary they are meant to be a gory good time. Check out my summary reveiw on this site on the DVD version of this site if you want to know my opinon about the frist scream of my review titled as ""cheaziest slasher film I have scene."""
3,Your basic sequel,"(3.5 stars) A different psycho rampages through town after Cidney, the survivor of the first movie, ...guess what happens next. Still, it's entertaining and clever, ...with humor."
3,"The weakest of the series, but not bad overall.","Neve Campbell is once again stalked by the Ghostface killer, this time on a college campus. Sequel to the highly popular original has some mildly clever moments and is fairly engaging with a few suspenseful moments. But Kevin Williamson's script is a little often too inane (Particularly in the finale) and Craven's attempts at jump-in-your-seat shocks are far, far too obvious. Mostly middling fare.** 1/2 out of *****"
3,wonderful christian messages - poor judgement in girl's clothing,"I want to give this 5 stars for the wonderful messages that are packed into each message. Awesome!! However, the one thing that bothered me about this dvd set is that the female actresses dress in such tight fitting clothing. Granted, they don't show much skin, but their clothes are painted on. They are beautiful girls. They would look just as beautiful in more modest clothing. I think that any man or teen boy watching this series will have a hard time concentrating on the wonderful messages of the series because they will be watching the female bodies. I feel I can say this with great accuracy because I know that my attention was often pulled from the storyline due to the provocative images on the screen."
3,Good historical movie.,"The movie is black and white but still verey enteraining. Being from Chicago, it was nostalgic. However, some of the audio was out of sinc with the video."
3,My husband liked it,"Again, this was for my husband and he enjoyed it very much. I am not a fan of this type of movie so did not watch all of it."
4,Al Capone (Rod Steiger) DVD,"This 1959 version of Al Capone with Rod Steiger is well written and well made, with Steiger excellent as usual. The anamorphic widescreen picture is very good."
3,Al Capone (and just Al Capone),"Review for the 1959 film Al Capone, not the documentary:The Amazon reviewer hits the nail on the head: this film is really a Rod Steiger showcase. Watching this charismatic actor bring Capone to life, while occasionally chewing the scenery and spitting it back out at his on-screen enemies, makes for an intriguing two hours. Watch as Capone borrows a move from Shakespeare's Richard III and woos the distraught widow of a man whose death he was responsible for.Unfortunately, Fay Spain (who looks a bit like Jolene Blalock here) gives a weak performance as the widow. For that matter, fine second-fiddle actors Martin Balsam and James Gregory don't really get to strut their stuff. That fault probably lies in part with the unimaginative screenplay and with the equally unimaginative direction. Witness the lame letdown of a conclusion for examples of both.A mediocre movie with one great--or at least very interesting--performance."
4,how music moves people,"Rebeccasreads recommends THE SECRET OF TEACHING SCIENCE & MATH THROUGH MUSIC is a short & curious read, in need of editing & layout work, which offers compelling evidence that music & scholastic motivation are intrinsically entwined.THE SECRET OF TEACHING SCIENCE & MATH THROUGH MUSIC delves into lives of scientists, mathematicians, engineers, physicians & educators, Dr. Frank offers insights into how music can help your children & students with their learning.MUSICAL NOTES ON MATH by the same author is also an excellent teaching book."
4,A GREAT STORY,"While not as good as SJ's ""The Forbidden Lord"" (5 plus stars!), this is an entertaining story. A spunky heroine and a dashing hero. The story delivers plenty of what all romance readers look for. The love scenes sizzle! A keeper!"
2,A disappointment,"After reading the excerpt and several of the reviews, I expected an highly engaging read. Ian's need to marry and produce an heir provided the necessary tension, but the rest seemed contrived and a patchwork of scenarios from other romances. The humor was rather flat and I didn't get very interested in any of the characters. I kept reading to find out about the great mystery that darkened Ian's soul - it was certainly a tragedy that could warp a young man. If this was the best of Ms. Jeffries as some of the reviewers suggest, I probably will not be looking for more of her books."
3,Least interesting of the series,"I gave this review 3 stars instead of 2 because there was enough there to finish the book. The summaries all cover the plot points so I will say is that I did not like this heroine at all. There wasn't anything about her that felt interesting or sympathetic. Also the gossip column story in fantasy and secrecy is okay, but to have her be outed and it's okay with everyone was ridiculous. Reading Gideon and Sarah's story was great and Jordan and Emily's was very good, I think maybe she ran out of steam writing this one."
3,Stubborn vs... Stubborn,"Two bullheaded characters trying to outwit one another. There is so much time spent on that, it's a wonder the couple ever fall in love. Cut out about 100 pages of that and paste in some romance. The couple has chemistry but there are too many misunderstandings and Ian's ""BIG SECRET"" was not even worth being a secret. His reason for having to marry would have been enough. Felicity is clever but she played just a little too hard to get. For goodness sakes, she's penniless and has four brothers to provide for, why refuse the Viscounts' proposal. If you can make it through the first 225 pages, the last 150 pages are pretty good."
5,Wonderful story,"This was a terrific book. The characters Ian and Felicity were complex and witty and therefore very interesting! Ian was such a mystery, and not like the normal arrogant rake. Felicity was much simpler, she was just trying to hold her family together no matter the cost. I really liked that about her. They both had issues from the past which shaped them, but didn't weight down the story. The chemistry between them ignited right from the start. They were both passionate people and were well matched. I liked them both very much and this book was highly enjoyable!"
2,Not practical,"I always try to live as healthy, sustainably, organically, etc as possible. But, I also lead a practical life. I gave up toxic cleaners long ago and typically only use baking soda, vinegar and a few essential oils. I make my own detergent (laundry and dishwasher), my own cleaning supplies, shampoo, etc. This book was mostly fluff and it ranged to the deranged. Too new age-y for my taste. I live in the real world and require real solutions, I found this to be an unhelpful resource. (I didn't just read it, I own it...I've read through it multiple times and still find it to be a waste) Much shorter books with much more useful information exist out there...don't waste your money on this one."
4,Giant!,"This is a huge book, lots of info...almost too much. Lots to read...too much. Not an easy or quick read."
3,"Good, but...","This pulls some serious electricity -- it runs off a 1000-plus-watt element -- and in my house, it causes breakers to switch off. I eventually converted this to a charcoal smoker (Meco sells a kit to do this). This really shouldn't be a problem in newer houses.At this price, though, I'd have to look hard at a Weber Smoky Mountain cooker. It's not stainless but it is enameled steel and it comes with a cover -- it should last for years and years, if not decades and decades. It also has superior heat control (this Meco unit, like many water smokers, has no controllable vents). I've made some very good BBQ with this Meco but it does require a lot more attention than my Smoky Mountain. I use this at big BBQs when I often will fire up this, plus a Weber, plus a big barrel grill."
2,Leaks like a sieve,"Got this smoker as a gift. Looks very attractive but isn't very well-built. Lid is ill-fitting and smoke leaks out easily, which is particularly bad because it's an electric smoker and you need the smoke from the wood chunks to hang around. Also uses so much power that it kicks out my circuit breakers."
1,Defiantly Not Worth $190.22,Pros: StainlessCons: Took extremely long to receive it.Flimsy BoxBody bent on both the original and replacements.Loss parts in a sack. This caused damages to water pans.Instruction Manual is awful. Can't clearly see parts and were they go on.Instructions are unclear.Manual has two different models in it making it confusing.Parts were damaged.The electric cord is very loose that plugs into the smoker. Needs two screws not one.Replacement parts took a long time getting to me. From Meco.All-in-All it is not worth the trouble or the money spent.
1,I would NOT recommend this product,This product never made it to the fully put together state. I took it out of the box and started to put it together per the instructions when the wood actually split in half. I was so glad there was not a child on the chair when this happened because the remaining wood shard was sharp and could have easily punctured a lung on a toddler seeing as it almost cut my finger off when it split.
2,No Value,This is more like a T-shirt. Nothing special. Compared to other name brand products this item seems to run on the small size. You can probably get an equal value by buying a $15 T.
1,Biggest waste of money ever...,"This item is clearly the biggest waste of money I've ever committed, and that's saying a lot... The images are not big enough to really see what you're buying. The keyboard is difficult to use, for me at least. Nowhere did it say whether the Hebrew text would be vowelled, and it is not -- I suppose it's my fault for not figuring out that if it were, they'd say so."
5,Tyrone Power -Forgotten Matinee Idol,"Tyrone Power was from a reknown acting family. This collection focuses on movies not often showed on tv. Girl's Dormitory was merely a walk-on at the end of the picture but it was enough to catch the interest of the female preview audiences and set Power on his way as becoming the top male star of 20th Century Fox Studio. Both Johnny Apollo and This Above All showcase Power's acting abilities that were often not used by his studio. These films have great supporting actors, such as Loretta Young, Linda Darnell, Dorothy Lamour and Joan Fontaine. This is must for any Power fan."
4,I'll Never Forget You...,"Since the dawn of man the thought of time travel has been both mind boggling and fantastic! But this one is unique in the fact it took 50 years to get it in DVD! With actors Tyrone Power, Micheal Rennie and Ann Blyth in the cast - this one is GOLD!Being very accurate in its own science, it depicts physics of fifty years ago.Its ""Wizard of Oz"" black and white to color are well done in its story telling.Take ""The Time Machine"" and you may go back ""Time after Time""...See this ""Love Story"" in its most unusual splendor.Thank yougary's movies"
5,tyrone power matinee idol collection,tyrone power great actor...the mark of zorro still a classic for me...among others he played the black rose etc.
4,Ty Power matinee Box-set,"At least Fox give Mr Power his place as their biggest male star of Vintage Hollywood. This box-set may not contain his greatest movies but it is most welcome and does contain some of his rarest performances.Tyrone Power was not the best actor but he was a great movie star and a very competent actor. It is great to see him here alongside Gene Tierney , Loretta Young, Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine, Dorothy Lamour, Anne Baxter and Ann Blyth + mnay familiar Fox character actors.All the film transfers are good and it is a pleasure watching these films which have not been available before on DVD."
5,Tyrone Power Matinee Idol Collection,"Great movies for the fans of Tyrone. My favorite, which is why I purchased this collection is The Luck of the Irish. A sure winner for me!!!!"
3,Very enjoyable movies,"A great retrospective of the movies of Tyrone Power, and why he was so popular during his time. The constant smoking in these movies too is a reminder of the commerialization of the genre in order to sell cigarettes, and of Power's untimely death from the consequences of smoking."
3,Old school,"C'est du vieil Hollywood, des comédies qui ont très mal vieillies. Les femmes sont belles mais les intrigues sont insignifiantes. Ou bien il s'agit d'un couple marié, et ils se disputeront durant une heure avant de se réconcilier à la fin, ou bien ils ne sont pas encore mariés et ils le seront à la fin du film, après bien des quiproquos sans intért.C'est laborieux, c'est très ""bourgeois"" et si l'on évoque l'adultère, on ne franchit jamais le pas. Quant au sexe, il n'existe pas.Reste le charme de Tyrone Power, ses beaux cheveux noirs, son beau sourire, sa prestance physique. C'est bien peu vis-à-vis de scénarios indigents et tous plus prévisibles les uns que les autres."
5,Left Alone,"When I first listened to Left Alone, I thought this song is kicks butt. The sound and beat made me buy the CD. Its great! When I got the CD, I put it in and the first song ""America"" came on, The riff in it is awesome. I recommend everyone to listen to Quinton's songs and if you love it like I did, Buy It Now!!! Every song on the track is great-really!!"
5,Simply The Greatest French Film I have Seen,"I saw this film years ago on Canadian TV by accident while a student living in Buffalo. The two children are incredible, and the adults are equally strong. I found the whole coming-of-age story very touching and completely believable. One of my all-time favorite films... I will add my vote for a DVD or HD DVD release as this one is about as deserving as a film can be."
3,"Final album with some good songs, but ruined by the majority","Listening to _Milk and Kisses_ almost makes one happy that the Twins split when they did, as their songwriting was beginning to run dry after a 14-year career. Although this album has a few excellent songs, ""Tishbite,"" ""Treasure Hiding,"" and ""Seekers Who are Lovers,"" the majority of the album is uninspired, uninspiring boringness. ""Half-Gifts,"" which in its first version on the ""Twinlights"" EP was an enthralling, glorious song, is in its _Milk and Kisses_ version ruined by a goofy sounding calliope. ""Ups"" and ""Eperdu"" are so dull that they are actually difficult to listen to.This review gets three stars because, when the Cocteau Twins are in fine form as they are in the three good songs of this album, the Twins deserve applause, but I certainly wouldn't recommend that anyone pick this one up as a first CT album."
1,GET THE REMIX IMPORT VERSION,"it may be hard to get, but its worth it. the import version is one of the best electronica records i own. its lush ambient emotional sound scapes totally accent the vocals. the u.s. rock version of this record is crap radio grunge. not art."
3,One of the most disappointing records ever,"I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews of this album, since I found it to be one of the most disappointing purchases ever. I give it 3 stars anyway because I love the band so much, but this pales in comparison to all of their previous work. The songs are good, the melodies are pleasant, but the magic seems to be gone. Where is the mystery? Liz Fraser still has the best voice ever, but she has definitely lost something over the years, and her attempts to sing lyrics subtract from instead of add to the album's mystique. Guthrie, meanwhile, seems to have run out of magical soundscapes to sweep us away. It is all old hat, and while it makes for very pleasant background music, I never thought that would be the best thing I'd have to say about a Cocteau Twins release."
1,This is the end,"It's unfortunate that a band as great as the Cocteau Twins had to go out with such a disappointing record. This is their least inspired work in an extensive catalog of many sublime moments. When you listen to it you get the feeling that they are just going through the motions. Nothing here is *bad* mind you -- just boring and uninspired. When you are used to having their music take you somewhere else you can't help but feeling disappointment. Absolutely unessential twins. If you are a new fan start with Heaven or Las Vegas, Blue Bell Knoll or their best ep Love's Easy Tears."
5,Au contraire on TH,"Not so much a review but a response to the last person. In my opinion, Treasure Hiding is the best song on the album.I love the way it just builds very slowly and majestically and then, bang, its there. And those swirling guitars just get me right here ( there, follow my finger)Have to agree with Seekers who are Lovers. A truly great song and yes, it has elements of eroticism about but then I've always fancied Liz Fraser!! Oooh, that voice.Buy this, this is real music for the soul"
3,"Inconsistent, but still has some magic","It's unfortunate this album was the last studio release of the Cocteau Twins prior to their disbanding, because it doesn't do the band justice given their previous work. 'Ups' is far too saccharine for my taste, and they ripped themselves off with the track 'Treasure Hiding,' which sounds remarkably similar to the live version of 'Pur.' 'Half-gift's contains some emotionally powerful lyrics, but the production is too mundane. The live version found on the 'BBC Sessions' disc is far superior.Despite the lack of coherance, the album has a few strong songs, including 'Calfskin Smack, 'Serpentskirt', and 'Seekers Who are Lovers.' 'Seeker's Who are Lovers' is an extremely romantic, haunting track which conjures images of looking for a long-lost lover on a rainy, dark night."
3,Not as bad as some people say,"I have one of these, it's been played with by kids a LOT and used for staged pictures with model horses, held up just fine other than the buttons on the jacket popping off a couple of times. I'm actually shocked at how terrible some people say these are. I definitely wouldn't say it's as high quality as Breyer's tack and model horses, though."
2,"Not as pictured,","We are satisfied with the quality of the doll so far. My daughter added this to her amazon wish list, I purchased it, both of us thinking it was a set, as the main display photo is of the doll on the horse. The product should be shown by itself. After s&h the doll alone was near $20."
1,so disappointed,"I bought this doll for my 9 yr. old daughter on her birthday. The first time she played with it, the arm broke off. My daughter had really wanted this doll for her birthday, and is very careful with her toys. For the arm to break so easily is very frustrating and disappointing."
1,Poor Quality,"We bought out daughter quite a bit of Breyer for Christmas. One doll arrived broken, another broke as we removed it from the packaging. Breyer uses weak, overstretched elastic to hold the legs together at the hips. Very disappointing. Oh, and one of the horses arrived with a chip out of the ear. Poor QA/QC. Cannot recommend Breyer."
2,Broken Arm,My daughter too has several of these dolls. At least two of them have broken off arms. We have tried everything from hot glue to tape and they won't stay on. We just refer to them as her handicapped dolls. Not politcally correct but then again how do you explain it to a young girl? They are made from cheap materials and not worth the greif they cause when broken.
5,A Must for all Star Wars fans!,"This book is the bomb! The art is amazing and facinates the imagination, the quality of the book is perfect, The cross-sections are the best and are getting bigger... and better than the last book and I can expect the next one to be the best of them all. Excellent job, Curtis J. Saxton. I am most pleased. Star Wars rules and may the force be with you!P.S. This book is DEFINITLY WORTH The money! Bye!"
4,"If you enjoyed the movie, you must have this book","If you are a tech-fan of Star Wars, you must have this book. It brings a lot of information on the ships that appear in the movie.The only thing I missed is some pictures of the ships without the cross-section, to compare some details."
4,Excellent.....but...,"I bought the second in concert dvd first because it was the newest one out there. I wanted to make sure that the tracks were still realtively fresh. I was totally blown away by it so I got the first one. Although there is more content to the dvd the second concert destroys this one. It's just to outdated. Both discs have some excellent material, the second one just has the better track listing."
4,5.0 is the only downfall,"It's an amazing DVD with a breathtaking tracklist. The only thing I have to say against it, is that it should be 5.1. Instead of that, you get Dolby 5.0, and with my system I don't get to appreciate it fully. I just wanted to point that out because that was the only surprise that I found when I got the DVDs. Anyways, I repeat, great tracklist!! I wish I was there!"
4,Still worth it - part of history,"I short, the DVD was more eyes than ears. The DVD is somewhat dubbed so that the performances dont look as real as they could be. However the Video (in high def) is amazing, they really make you fell like you were right their --- next to Tijs. I still think the sound should of sounded like it came from a stadium (it sounds like they ripped the songs right off of Nyana!~!! and etc)but still more than worth the money, very important buy. (history anybody>?)Why four stars and not Five?If someone had to decide between Another day at the office or TiC, I would tell them to take Another day at the office, I like it better recording wise."
4,Decently good concert DVD for Tiesto,"Overall i would have to say that its a great DVD. If you like Tiesto/Trance then this is the DVD for you. Although i think he did try a bit 2 much to involve different styles of music from around the world, a bit like a circus. I would skip through those tracks. But its a good DVD to come home and watch after a long night of house partying with your friends and just drift into a deep euphoric sleep with Tiesto controlling everything."
5,JUST TOO GOOD,"Having been fortunate enough to have seen tiesto numerous times before ,I really thought that knew what to expect from this dvd.I mean I knew that the track selection would be amazing but the whole show just blew me away.I truly believe that this takes the term of DJ'ing to a whole new level and just goes to show why tiesto is number 1 in the world right now.He always pushes the boundaries and keeps setting the standard.His interaction with the crowd and the amazing light displays just added to the whole spectacle.It was'nt just a mix set but a sublime performance.I would recommend this dvd to any dance music lover or to anyone who wanted to find out what the scene is all about.It's dance music personified.......tieso kicks ass!!!"
3,dissappointing,a great concert DVD annoyingly spoiled by fluctuating sound levels-just when I am really getting into the groove the sound would suddenly die down and then swell at other times in a way that was definitely not in the concert.Very intrusive and dissappointing.Just bad sound recording.Pity.
1,Perfect DVD for Attention Deficient Disorder suffers,"My recommendation, play the DVD and watch something else at the same time, unless you like every 2 seconds a different camera shot of the concert. Note to producer - Just because you have a bunch of cameras it does NOT mean you HAVE to use all of them and show us what they are viewing every 2 seconds! This video is almost unwatchable just because of non stop camera switching. The concert itself was very well done, not just your typical DJ spinning records like Sasha and Digweed (the WORST concert I have ever been too). Plenty of visual affects and lighting, too bad we do not have the opportunity to actually enjoy any of them any longer than 2 seconds. This DVD will now probably end up in my rarely watched pile. In the mean time I'll be watching Paul Van Dyk's ""Global (Bonus DVD)"" and Underworld's ""Everything Everything"" DVD."
5,Beautiful Book,"This book was first introduced to me by my daughters preschool teacher. This book not only has a nice story for young children, but has beautiful illustrations. My children enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoy reading it to them."
4,Anther Cute One from Audrey Penn,"Little Chester Raccoon survived his first day of school in The Kissing Hand with the reassurance of his Mother's love. This time around Chester has something else to fear--a baby brother--and his own jealousy.It is a cute and tender story that kept my little guys' attention. Not to mention the nice illustrations that accompanies the story. It reminds little ones that just because you are no longer the ""only"" one doesn't mean you are loved any less.I received this book free of charge from Tanglewood Press through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
4,"Good information, a little dry; but a fast, smooth read.","Bear Basics gives you some of the same information that you've read from other sources, but it breaks it down in simple terms. The writing is clear, concise; Dave Smith knows bears. He presents the information in a totally unbiased manner. The book is a smooth, fast read. If you have fears, it helps to alleviate them. Recommended to anyone who is entering bear country."
5,Backcountry Bear Basics,"I reckon I won't be encountering any bears in my neck of the city anytime soon, but I thought I give this book a read anyway. Well-written, concise and informatives, this book seems to give you all that you need to know. It debunks certain myths such as bears being attracted to menustrating females and the usefulness of climbing a tree (if you can make it there) to avoid an irrate bear. So if you are heading out into bear country and are not an experienced hiker, reading this book would be a good idea."
2,Not the best one out there,"The information presented in this book is very biased, as well as outdated, Mr. Smith seems to be living on his past experience which has been on most points, been proven inaccurate based on peer reviewed reports from scholars...he always harps on his experience in Alaska, which I am sure was valid for Alaska, but has little to do with a completely different population of bears in the lower 48, I am afraid, after reading this a couple of times, he is out of touch with what is going on in the real world, Mr. Smith it is time to actually get back out in the field and stop living off your past, we need a new updated book that actually addresses the bears that most of the country might actually have an encounter with.."
3,Would make a good pamphlet,"This books has good information, but not a lot of it. It would have made a good pamphlet--maybe even a booklet.To fill the rest of the book we get opinions. Opinions on just about every other bear book ever written, opinions on magazines and magazine articles, newspaper articles, the Parks Service, various research experiments, hikers, cyclists, snowmobilers, how to resolve land use issues, etc. etc.The author seems to value his own opinions greatly.The result was like listening to a series of endless arrogant rants from that co-worker you wish would just go back to his desk."
2,BEAR BASICS,"Just finished this book but took me 3 weeks cuz it didn't hold my attention. Bear Basics has some decent info in it but the author challenges every controversial point without following through and proving his case. Example, Are bears really unpredictable or are we just to ignorant to be able to predict them? Several times, he goes off the subject to gripe. Example ""I'd hike in a Scottish kilt and cowboy boots before I wore bear bells or walked with a group of people that talked nonstop for 8 hours straight."" The only other bear book I read was Bear Aware and I think it wins - its a quick to read book and has a lot of facts without a political or personal agenda. It also explains how to use pepper spray."
4,nice touch,"I love this border, it is very cute. However, I needed wall paper glue the get it to stick. The instructions only called for warm water. Now, a few months later, some of the edging is coming loose."
3,cute but difficult to put up,BEWARE! This item does not stick to the wall if you just follow the instructions on the tag. You have to use wall paper glue or it will not stick! Make sure to wipe any excess away to avoid runs or it staining the wall.The border added to the overall theme of our room. It looks great with the upper wall painted blue and the lower wall painted green. We can't wait to get more items for the nursery.
2,Put it up twice and it's fallen down both times.,"I've put this border up twice and both times it's fallen down about an hour later. The first time I thought it was because we didn't follow the directions very well. The second time we followed them to a 'T', and it still came down. We're going to try one last time with clue, but I do love the pattern, and it goes with both the peek-n-pooh pattern and the soft and fuzzy pooh pattern. We're doing most stuff except the border soft and fuzzy pooh, the new pattern that just came out."
2,not very sticky,"My wife and I purchased this border to go with the rest of the nursery....We love the design, however, as with the other reviewer, the border did not stick to the walls at all...We followed the directions to a ""T"" and an hour later, it fell off the wall in a crinkled mess....We were able to put it back up with wallpaper adhesive, but it was quite a hassle. You would think that at fifteen dollars a strip, the self adhesive would be a little more reliable....."
1,Cute border - if you have LOTS of time & patience,"We thought the colors were gender neutral, we painted the ceiling blue, the walls yellow, both a shade darker than the border and all white furniture and figured we would add pink Pooh accesories if girl, blue if boy. ALAS, it took my husband 4 trys to get this border up. Following the directions didn't help, then spray adhesive and then finally roll on wall paper glue. Buy 1-2 extra rolls, you are going to need them. For the price we paid you would think it would go on easier. My husband only had 1 week vacation to get the room done and the majority of it was spent running to Home Depot and pasting on the border. If we had to choose again we would not get this border. It wasn't worth our time."
5,Adorable but problems putting it up!,"My husband and I bought the comforter set that goes with this border. We love the border so we painted the nursery pink and yellow which we matched to the border. The problem was when we put up the wall border it had glue running down the paint and it fell down an hour later. We followed the directions so I am not sure what went wrong. We were able to buy a wallpaper paste and get it on the wall the next day. However, my husband had to paint the bottom of the wall again to cover the glue marks left on the wall.We love the way the border looks so I gave it five stars. However, if we were doing it again we would have just used wallpaper paste to start with instead of the messy glue that came on it. We are excited about how cute our daughters room looks with the Winnie the Pooh set though."
2,Winnie The Pooh Wall Border,"I liked the product, but as the supplier sent just one (I ordered 2) I face a problem. It doesn't cover the whole wall. I checked the internet site of toysRUS but they do not sell it on internet. So it is an unpleasent situation."
3,Review Title,"Pretty good overview of basic cosmology. Rees makes everything very accessible to anyone perhaps not familiar to the subject. However, his conjectures about a multiverse and his arguments for a multiverse are quite brutelike. This is a good example of why scientists need basic lessons in logic and philosophy. His a priori rejection of any sort of other explanation leaves his attempts at ""examining"" these other theories as feigned at best"
2,Read one of his other books,"This book seems to have been ""thrown"" together quickly. There are many editing errors and/or incorrect words used or words used in the wrong context. The subject matter is not far off of ""Just Six Numbers"" or ""Before the Beginning"" (both of which I loved). He seems to have written this book to appeal even more to the lay person than his other texts, but he is a little heavy on the so-called ""multiverse"" toward the end of this one (a hypothesis that I don't buy). It simply was not as enjoyable as his other books.If you want a relatively easy read on cosmology than this is a start, but I suspect you will enjoy his other books more."
3,Great Summer Look,"Nice looking slides for summer, good price (on sale). Slightly wider fit than I expected, otherwise, good!"
3,Comfortable Slide,"I liked the Sesto Meucci slide, after only one use the beading on the top of the shoe started to loosen. The beads are not attached securely and they looked like the majority would fall off after you've worn them a few times. I had to return them and got a refund, maybe the pair I got was defective in the beading work. They were comfortable and cute but did not last."
4,Good backup,"They make the best pumps and these replacement membranes are a must have if you lose them. The pump won't work without them so keep some handy. My wife loves the hospital grade pump, which we rent for about $60 month. Well worth it if you want your baby to be breastfeed."
1,Grossed Out,I ordered this product from Rymatt Wellness LLC assuming it would arrive in the packaging that is pictured in - absolutely not true. It arrived in a ziplock baggie which makes me think it's used and it's definitely false advertising. Gross!
3,a poor necessity,A much needed part for the pump but its such flimsy materiel. They always rip during washing or get swept down the drain. It's best to always have a few spares on deck.
5,So glad that they sell these,"These little membranes are so easy to lose, I don't know what I would do without this little replacement pack."
4,like them,Like the medella but they didn't seem to last long and lost suction pretty quick. I went through the whole set in just a couple months.
3,Overpriced,"There's not much to review here - if you have a Medela pump, you are pretty much stuck buying something like this. I find that paying about a dollar per membrane seems a bit much, but it's not like you have much choice."
2,Tears easily and Very expesive,These are just rubber membranes. There is no reason for them to be so expensive. But you have to buy them because you don't have any other choice for the Medela pumps. Another annoying thing is that they tear very easily. After every use you have to clean them and if you are not careful they will tear. That is why I guess they have a 6-pack as opposed to 2-pack which is all you should really need. I am giving 2 stars but really what other option do you have?
5,What I needed,"This is the product that I needed! Have to have it in order for pump to work, I had misplaced the ones provided with pump."
1,"Despite Recommendation, Doesn't Fit Specialneeds Feeder","I was trying to buy replacement parts for our son's Haberman bottle, and found the nipples easily. Amazon recommended these membranes to go with it. Since the product description doesn't specify what product these are compatible with, I ordered it, but they are completely different. The seller's retun policy is such that it isn't worth the effort."
3,Product in good condition,"The product was in good condition, easy transaction. The only thing was that I ordered the wrong product by this company and they don't carry what I was really looking for. Otherwise, the product was in good condition."
1,Kind of sketchy,"Just received my Medela membranes in the mail. Was a little nervous bc of the mixed reviews. The membranes I received did come in Medela packaging. However, the package is opened at the corner, so it looks like the product was tampered with OR non-Medela product was placed into Medela packaging. Sold by Linen Manor LLC. Comparing the product to my previously store-purchased Medela membranes, they look identical but not sure if that means anything. Still debating whether to send it back."
1,not pleased,"i recieved this product in the mail and all of the little pieces are all bent, they are not flat inorder to fit on the pump. It looks like they had been sitting around a long time, had been exposed to heat, and then curled up. Very disappointed"
3,"Erika, Erika , Erika","Ok, this was a good book. I was really disturbed with Cara. It just shows how wanted a young mentally challenger teen can be. The 'jocks' sickened me .... at one point I liked Scott I thought he was sweet to Laura Jean (and that is one of the things I liked about this book how Erika twisted with his image) it just shows how much a minority can effect everyone. Joe, I love him, he is just great. He stuck up for himself (what he believed in) and was descent . Laura Jean, geez, after she learned what had happened she still helped Scott? Sick, he should have gotten what he deserved. This is a very controversial issue about rape and at some points I favoured with the jocks and others with Cara.....she did incourage them but still they did take advantage of her...a fair piece of work not like I am one to judge but that is my personal opinion on this novel."
3,incomprehensible,"If you want to see examples of the variety of Celtic design, this book is a good resource. If you want to reproduce any of it and you aren't experienced, it's not very helpful -- there's too little comprehensible instruction. I've tried to draw by the diagrams but without luck. If you're a beginner (as I am) this book won't be of much help. Perhaps for artists with more experience and understanding of Celtic art this book would be of value."
2,His techniques are overcomplicated,"Bain's techniques are excessively complex. His knotwork is based on ""draw all the lines, then erase the parts that shouldn't be there"", which gets pretty messy. For more reasonable (and probably more period) techniques, see Aidan Meehan's Celtic Design series."
2,Celtic Art: The methods of construction,This was not what was advertised. I was looking for a book that broke down the steps todraw the celtic patterns. Wery hard to follow.
4,"Classic, but Difficult","Ian Bain was perhaps the first to attempt to create a ""how-to"" book for the ""average"" artist to learn Celtic design. This is a classic treatise, and no Celtic artist's library should be without a copy. That being said, his explanations are not always as clear as he thinks they are, and if this is your only source of instruction, you might walk away feeling frustrated. For the beginner, I find the books by Aidan Meehan to be easier to follow and more likely to produce early successes. I am NOT not recommending this book; there are areas that Bain investigates that cannot be found in Meehan's books, but for a starting place, I recommend the latter's books instead."
5,Very Informative,"As an amatour artist I had been wondering how to constuct celtic art for some time. This book not only shows you how to constuct them, but also takes you though it step by step. I recommend this book to all artist No matter what your level. Begginner or advanced, it's a wonderful book."
3,Mellow,Not as good as their first album.A more mellowed out tone focusing on vocals and political views
5,Slab Bulkhead!,"""Space Mutiny"" is a train-wreck, but the kind of train-wreck that does'nt make you wrench in agony (Catwoman), but the one you can watch time and time again and applaud it's efforts in looking as over the top and cheap as possible, from casting to sets, and even continunity (can the person behind that be legally arrested now)THIRLL as a Woman dies, and then is miraculiously ressurected only minutes later as a scene shot before her death comes AFTER it, MARVEL at ""Slab Bulkhead"" Dave Ryder defends the Battlestar Gaalctica...I mean, the Southern Sun from the evil forces of the evil Kalgon and Robbie Robertson, annd SCREAM as you watch the forces of good and evil fall from UNBELVIABLE HEIGHTS from railings that infest the ship.Bear witness to the greatest GOLF CART CHASE OF ALL TIME, (I mean ""Space Buggy"" chase), ""Space Mutiny"" is a classic that can appreciated either through MST3K or without."
1,That goofy laugh,"I can see why Mystery Science Theater 3000 used this as one of its featured films; the acting is just over the top. I couldn't tell if they were all trying to be that bad or if they thought they were really doing a good job, I guess we will never know. All the space footage was stolen straight from battle star galactica, the bridge personnel were dressed in swim suits, jump suits and sleeveless costumes, nothing matched. Now for the interior of the ship it was nothing more than the inside of a factory which they didn't even try to make to look like a ship, I'm surprised they took the time to cover the windows.If you just want to laugh at a bunch of morons, buy this film and get good and toasted."
3,Spaced out Mutiny,"This has got to be one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever tried to watch and that's why I loved it. It's only fair in acting and special effects are non existent but it's so lousy that you have to watch. It's gained the title honestly and isn't the worst I've seen but is in contention. I don't want to ruin the surprise ending but I was wondering if they were fool enough to think a sequel was in the offing. For the true collector of b movies this is one you will need, for the critic...choose something else. It's one I am glad to own but I'm kinda sick that way."
1,"Horrible movie, hilarious episode of MST3K","This is the kind of movie which makes a man want to remove his eyes with rusty spoons. The girl who comes back from the dead for one scene, Captain Santa, the evil Calgon, Big McLarge Huge's epic scream during the golf cart race; this movie is the content of nightmares. Do not watch this movie around pregnant women and open flames. Unless it's the MST3K version. Then show it to the Pope. It's that funny."
5,"""Exciting as exciting can be, I must say!""","This a stupid and boring movie, but when you see it as part of the show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", its HILARIOUS. They make up all these funny names for the hero like ""Hack Blowfist"", ""Bulk Vanderhuge"", ""Stump Junkman"", etc... In conclusion, ignore the original version, but if you can find a tape of the MST3K episode of it, then buy it, I must say!"
2,"Very funny movie, but i don't think that's what they meant","OK this movie is BAD,BAD,and BAD(hence two stars) but it really is funny and very silly. Reb Brown(the hero) flexes his muscles and shouts a lot, the heroine is at least 10 years older than the hero(she looks like his mother), and the bad guy comes across like silent movie bad guy(only he does have the evil laugh down pat, really, he uses it every 10 mins.).The story is some mess about the title event and it has some of the worst chase scenes (on floor sweepers and tricked out golf carts) ever put on screen. If you enjoy poor film making this piece of rotten mess can be great fun."
1,Every bit as awful as expected.,"One of the worst Sci fi movies of all time.So I had to have a copy.Legendarily excoriated by Mystery Science Theatre 3000, Space Mutiny has cutting edge special effects. Cutting Edge when they were in Battlestar Galactic that was.This movies only redeeming point is how humorously bad it is."
1,Humm...MST3K anyone?,"Um, this is so bad. It's got no plot, no acting, and terrible special effects. MST3K Made this film better, but I warn you to never watch this with out MST3K. So what is this film? A bunch of stock footage ripped form other movies, an old industrial building, and lots of railing kills. It has some bald greasy guy for the bad guy, and a huge bulky guy who'd throughout the film, squeal like a little girl which was quit odd. It also doesn't explain what the mutiny was about. It also has some weird people that dance around and worship plasma balls. Oh and the ""amazing"" technology looks like a bunch of old apple compuers and some graphics of an atari game system. Yes this is totally a cheese fest. Only watch the MST3K version."
1,This one deserved to be on MST3k,"I can only hope that everyone who gave this movie five stars was joking. Why is it that everyone here reviews the actual movie on the MST3k episode page, and then reviews the MST3k episode on the movie page? Murphy's Law really got into its element here. Everything you could possibly think of to make a movie worse is here. I don't care if Cisse Cameron really is Cameron Mitchell's daughter, she looks like his mother! Many times, the spaceship looks like a factory/boiler room, and sometimes you can even see light coming through the windows! To top it all off, the crew must have had not nearly enough material to make a feature film, so they added the bellarians, who do absolutely nothing yet take up more than half the screen time. This movie was not a total waste though, it was one of the best MST3k episodes of the Sci-fi era."
5,great horror punk,"this is an awesome c.d. with bands like mister monster,blitzkid,gotham rd.,ghoul squad and dr.chuds x-ward horror punk is alive and kicking!"
2,Not that good,"Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid!"
1,garbage,"the vocals on here are horrible, sounds like a cheap danzig impression. the music is ok but the lyrics are just as bad as the vocals, stupid lyrics like i wish i could make out with her. amy sue is a terrible song. this album would be alot better with a different vocalist and with different lyrics. dont waste your money on this."
2,What the hell is Boo-Wop???,"Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a ""re-worked"" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years."
5,One of my very favorite books,"Even though the characters in the book are very different from my own family, ""Mazel"" affirmed many of my personal feelings about being Jewish. It brought to mind many of the stories told to me about Eastern Europe by my parents and older relatives, while at the same time opening up my mind to new aspects of Jewish life. And it made me want to find out more about my own family history.The way the three generations of women view the world and Judaism is fascinating, and totally believable. I have given this book as a present many times, and have reread it more than once.I wish I could read more about this fascinating collection of women!"
3,Ok gift item,"Biggest disappointment was how the item arrived. Packing tape covered the circular plate box. Seemed like my shipment had been returned, taped up and sent out. This was a gift (thankfully to a close friend), so she didn't care that the box was destroyed by the wonky tape all over the plate box. Plates themselves are a bit ""busy"" in their design, but fairly interesting. I'm not rating this 3 stars because of the packaging. An overall simple design would have been preferred. Ad I saw (in Real Simple) only showed the red/mustard-y plate which is not completely representative of the other plates."
3,So elated!,I was once given a set of 4 as a gift from someone returning from Paris or a Cheese factory. I have to say I am elated to see that these are back in stock. They are sensational little plates for afternoon tea or for heavier appetizers at a cocktail party. I cannot wait to receive them. I have made two mistakes before and ordered the dessert version (also very nice) and am thrilled to see these little beauties available.
3,Not a Set of 8!!!!,"These plates are very nice, but the title is misleading. There are two boxes of 4 plates, and they are identical. And ""Gift Boxed""???? The inner boxes are just regular ol' cartons. Buyer Beware!!"
3,A pleasant read,"It is an very touching story and an enjoyable read. As the reader I felt for the characters. It is truly a ""My Fair Lady"" version but the setting is early American to England. William Woodville is escaping from his father's strong and family title hold by going to American to discover America's wilderness on a canvas through paint. He and his friends come upon indians trading a white woman, Margery Mackinnon, that has been raised by indians as a slave. Feeling for her he trades for her- only to be used by him. He marries her and takes her back to England humiliate his father and show his father that only he controls his destiny. Deserting he and going to back America, he realizes that he has love for her and slowly makes his way back to England to claim her heart which takes a couple of years to accomplish- only to find her transformed into a beautiful, well trained, lady with a surprise (or make that 2 surprises) of her own for him. I say read it for yourself, but it's not a keeper."
2,Disappointing compared to the earlier Mackinnon books.,"The plot of ""If You Love Me"" is basically the same as that of Ms. Coffman's earlier novel ""Heaven Knows"". Although I highly recommend ""Heaven Knows"", I find ""If You Love Me"" incredibly disappointing. In ""Heaven Knows"", Coffman explores in great depth the profound love that the heroin, Elizabeth, has for the hero, Tavis, and the resulting pain over Tavis' betrayal. In ""If You Love Me"", however, Coffman barely scrapes the surface of the relationship between Margery and William. For this reason, William's abandonment is much less realistic, much more painless, and much less heartfelt. In addition, the characters in ""If You Love Me"" remain utterly undeveloped. Read ""Heaven Knows""; skip ""If You Love Me""."
4,very good book,"The book does read like a novel as many have already commented. My primary gripe is the book bogs down quite a bit at the start as it provides the biography of each of the main characters. So the reader is really grinding away on the bios before the story begins. Once the story begins, however, this is a very gripping true tale. Abe Baum and his team are definitely heroes for what they did and attempted to do. These mass-market paperbacks tend to be excellent values. The price is right and the publishers have usually separated the wheat from the chaff when selecting what to publish."
2,Pleasant but extremely drying!,"I have combination skin and mild rosacea. This product smelled wonderful, was pleasant to use and calming but left my skin extremely dry and flaky. I purchased it because I use and love other Dermalogica products, especially the Multi-Vitamin Eye Lift treatment. I've returned to Dove for Sensitive Skin at a fraction of the price."
4,Great for Sensitive Skin,"This cleanser is the best for sensitive skin. Although I wish it removed makeup better, if you have sensitive skin, then this is a must especially in winter."
2,The graph is cheating,"Update: I believe they have corrected the graph and description. Still it doesn't justify what they did when I purchased it. - Jan. 23rd, 2013I received this moon cake mold as a gift. My friend suggested me to add this to my registry, and we both believe that it comes with two molds. However, there is only one in the box I opened. I checked very carefully with the description, and found nothing like ""the photo contains one more item which you won't get in your package""!I believe it is intended misleading. Since I got it as a gift, I have no receipt and can't really return it. I definitely don't want to disturb my friend by telling him ""you are cheated"". However, I can still write this review here to show my angry!I checked all the similar items sold by this seller. I believe they all have the same problem. Make sure you want to pay $20 for ONE mold before you actually order it!"
4,nice mold,I like it because it is deep and big. Easy to use. The result is very impressive. It is a little pricy. I wish Amazon would sell it so that we can save the shipping fee.
1,mooncake mold,"This one is awful.Every time I used it to make moon cake, I had to pound it so hard on the counter in order to make the cake come out of the mold."
5,"Looks great, Not bad to install, very affordable","Great product to install on your old trailer bunks. I just ripped and cut the old carpet off, removed any staples that were sticking out (hammered in the remaining ones) and then glued and stapled this carpet to the bunks to make my trailer look brand new again!"
3,too short length does not match specs!! Beware,"Carpet is ok quality. The length varies and was not the 144"" as described ab out 8-10"" too short. Had to use other carpet to = 12'"
1,Cheap carpet,"I bought this carpet for trailer bunks and its so thin that the glue seaps through it. Also its not 12"" wide either its 11&3/4 wide instead. I would not buy this carpet, it just ruins a project."
4,Great way to restore a trailer,Good delivery. Looks greatmaking my trailer seem almost new. Could be a little wider for 2X6 bunks but otherwise a great buy at about half the price of the national marine chain store. Will be buying another for my sailboat trailer.
5,Good Quality Carpet,"I was very happy to get this carpet to cover the traioler bunks. The carpet has been durable, it did not fray at the ends, and the boat slides nicely on and off."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. Really fun and easy to cook with. After steaming your couscous, try flavoring it with [[ASIN:B0000DJFEN Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa], it really adds a great middle eastern kick."
3,Music and Lyrics by Cole Porter vol. 1,"Good tunes, but I'd rather have a fake-book version with just lead lines, lyrics and chord calls of the songbook and save a lot of page turning."
1,Little more than a poorly implemented gimmick,"I ordered this with an open mind and a genuine desire to use this product. Regrettably however, I must say that this application is, at best, a poor implementation of an interesting concept. If it were less expensive it might be an amusing novelty but I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to you at the price that they are asking for it. Here is why:The interface is clunky and a distraction from the real work at hand. The nonstandard interface is not the least bit intuitive and the amount and quality of the information provided is not relative in value to the time wasted to achieve it.I found a product named Ultralingua that is fast, easy to understand and lets me find what I am looking for quickly and get back to the business at hand: writing. Take a look at it. You might find it to be useful."
3,Interesting product,"Visual Thesaurus (VT) is an interesting product to me. It falls in the middle of the review pack, neither a scam nor software heaven. On the plus side it seems to only have the right words in its dictionary, no dumb words, and adequate definitions. Note that the database of words is a bit small. On the minus side, if you're a Vista user, it will take you out of Aero mode into basic mode when it loads. But overall, it is a product I use."
5,Innovative software product and a comprehensive thesaurus,Visual Thesaurus is an innovative software product with a friendly graphical interface. It redefines the process and improves the effectiveness of using a comprehensive thesaurus dictionary. Visual Thesaurus is so much fun to use that I often find it hard to stop tracing the word links long after an appropriate word match has been found.
2,Audio,"May 9 2010, I have just purchased the Visual Thesaurus and found it to be very visually playful, however it needs plenty of work done to make it stronger. I compared this with Encarta's Audio Dictionary and Webster's Audio Dictionary. Both have audio without the use of the internet. I don't think this company Thinkmap Inc. wasn't thinking too much on this project. I trully believe this software could have a favorite section and a word category section for your words. Also, a tool to enter or saves some words that's not included in the Thesaurus. Compared to the other two dictionary, this thesaurus needs work. Today's technology shouldn't have to be skimpy on including ALL--ALL the pronuciations without the use of the internet. If this problem isn't corrected with a PATCH UNDATE. I wasted my money."
4,good productive,I purchased this product because it seemed interesting. Originally I thought I would use it for my creative writing. But it has become a daily tool for many things. It is very good
1,This product sucks!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, I don't claim to be a computer wiz, but installing software is pretty easy. I bought this piece of junk and am greeted immediately by a message that tells me I cannot install Visual Thesaraus unless I am logged on as an administrator. Do I know what that means? NO! Is there a number to call where I will no doubt have to trek through an hour and a half of various phone trees to get help? NO! There is no assistance. If you go to their website there is no prompt where you can get help? NO! So I am left with a disk I paid $40.00 for that doesn't do what it promised. So, if you are someone who struggles with computers, you might just stick with the paper edition. If there is anyone-perhaps someone who is affiliated with the company who made this program-who can explain to me what 'logging on as an administrator' means on my own computer and what I need to do, I'll retract this review."
3,Not Bad,"If you are into Slow Roosevelt then you could probably do without this cd. The production value is pretty low and well they just don't sound like they do now. Not that the music contained on it is too bad, just that the production value sucks so its kinda hard to care. Get Weightless, great production value and GREAT hard rock/metal. Also, Amazon has the original release date on this as 1991 when in fact it came out 1996 (that's from the cd itself)."
4,Con guitarra y voz,Fue mi primero obra de Silvio y todavia es mi favorita. Si busques una sonida muy folklorica sin demasiado acompamiento...Lo sera un buen eleccion. Las melodías son importante pero las palabras son las mas importante aqui.
5,reviewed by wsbu,Goofy and jangly folk songs with the feeling of Beck's One Foot in the Grave and Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica (note: Captain Beefheart has avant-garde influences and gives an absurd side to usually basic forms of music) mixed in with sound clips from several 80's video game classics. On the verge of insane genius!Recommended tracks:> > 10. 10 Ft. Coffin> > 1. Fake Violin Solo> > 13. Cyclone Took My Baby> > 11. Steamroller
3,Merely an introduction,"This book's exercises are far too shallow and easy to really teach the language. The most useful exercises are those that ask you to write down something you hear in Portuguese. To get the most out of this book, after completing it listen to all the Portuguese dialogues and transcribe them without looking at the book.This book is an introduction at best."
1,Heresy,"This book should be called The Lost Heresy of Satan. It is clear that this humanistic liberal kind of theolgy is the reason why people easily reject the gospel in these times. Essentially the Author Cherry picks a few texts on love and builds up a false view of the Lord. He Recycles all the old dead 19th century theology that God is not a God of Holiness and Wrath. That man is not, as the bible says in his very nature an object of Gods wrath and the infinte Glory, mercy, love and Grace, which God then shows to us is cheapened and many biblical doctrines ignored. If this author really wants to spread christianity he should expound the whole counsel of God."
4,"Worth a look, but nothing too groundbreaking","Four stars might be a little high, but not too much of a stretch. This book will not present a lot of new ideas to those familiar with Brian McLaren, NT Wright, and the like. It is, however, an easy read and presents a few interesting ideas.The basic theme here is that the kingdom of God is available right now through Jesus Christ. Chalke delves into his own ideas and experiences in an effort to inspire a viewpoint of Christ that is not filtered through our Western culture. There are a few debatable interpretations, but Chalke mostly plays it safe. It's a good short read, but nothing that will knock your socks off."
1,"One word for this movie : ""Crap""!","I am a true die-hard science fiction fan, but this movie is stiff and contrived. Lacks real kick-but action and the plot is absolutely implausible. I really wasted my time on this one; so will you."
1,the new milla?,"for those elect few, now become many, who compulsively dredge the absolute bottom reaches of cinema for whatever debris they can find, outerworld shows unusual signs of endurance...for those who dwell at the near, flat end of the quality curve, illegible subtitles translating from out of synch urdu, is regarded as the perfecting combination of one of several gourmet subgenres ...the female brain courier is a comer...expect to see more of her as an occasional addin of sitcoms...then on to staring roles in movies no one will watch (such as king lear and the seagull; that's TWO titles), and finally big tyme parts in serious cinema, at the level of such classics as death song of an alderman, and staring up my mother's dress...sophia loren and madonna both began as hookers, which is actually a step up from outerworld, but i am seeing possibilities here...ciao."
2,Hoo-boy,"It's kinda like a bad porno .. except without the nudity and sex .. Just the cheesy bad acting, It does have some unintentional comedic value ... hence the two stars."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"OLD, VERY BAD sci-fi film SLIGHTLY updated with computer generated graphics. The acting is laughable. Looks like someone decided to make a film with their video camera. Do not waste your money on this one. The quality of the box is better than the film."
1,Very very cheesy,I could not get through even 15 minutes of this very very low budget film. Even the acting was bad..!
3,Outerworld,Fair movie with some entertainment. Actors sounded like they were just reading their lines. I don't think I want to see it again.
2,"Portuguese sound and pronunciation, terrible.","1) The sound from this machine is not very audible (ie. it is pretty soft, even with the volume on high).2) The pronunciation of Portuguese is a joke. For example one of the most commonly used verbs in Portuguese ""fazer"", is butchered by the verbal announcer. ""Fazer"" is just one of many mispronounced words. The machine's bad pronunciation has nothing to do with it being programmed in Continental Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese or regional accents, it is just plain wrong in many cases. Etaco, you need to do a complete makeover on this one...3) I don't want to drop this machine, it appears fragile.4) A lot of money for a little bit of product."
5,A real lifesaver,"I use this mostly for Portuguese to English and am finding it very useful. You can say the voice is a bit strange in both languages but you get used to it and it really does put the accents clearly where you need them to be. In fact, when I try and speak just like the machine everyone understands me without a problem - which I guess is the true test of its usefulness."
5,Works great in the Tundra!,"I bought this pen to leave in my car so I could complete mileage logs for my job. One morning recently, I got in my car and realized I hadn't entered the previous day's mileage yet. The temperature was -17 (yes, that's in Fahrenheit!). I tentatively pulled out my new Fisher Space Pen, knowing that none of my other pens would work until the inside of the car warmed up at least 50-60 degrees. The Fisher Space Pen worked great, with NO warm-up required! Now, if I can just get my frozen garage door to work!"
4,Wife takes it EVERYWHERE!,"My wife loves this little pen, she does a lot of moving around at her school and has to do paperwork constantly. This pen writes well and the customer service was great. We noticed a small crack in the base near the silver band that was flexing when she would write with it and didn't look like it would be good in the long run, so we sent it to the Fisher Company in Utah and they sent us a brand new pen within 3 weeks!"
2,Useful Info but beware,"Many of the reviews state this book is for advanced learners. That's true, but one can't necessarily trust that the example sentences are correct.An example involving the usage of ""dürfen"", given as an example in the section for ""behandeln"":1) Sie durfte das Kind, den Hund nicht behandeln.The author uses dürfen as though it means ""to allow sb/sth"", but it means ""to be allowed"".""behandeln"" just happened to be the fourth example I went looking for, so I found this example sentence rather quickly, and that makes all other examples suspect, in my opinion."
3,A Beckett play that has had grown men (and women) in tears.,"Probably the most famous of Beckett's last works, 'Rockaby' features an old woman rocking mechanically on her chair, listening to a recorded poem evoking a life perhaps similar to her own, solitary, staring out of her window at the shuttered windows opposite, yearning for a glimpse of humanity to justify a life she is close to cursing. It reads like a skittish remix of a story from Joyce's 'Dubliners'.Like most of Beckett's late stage works, this doesn't really work on the page - the rhythmic combination of words, images, lighting and the mechanical rocking of the chair create a startling visual-aural effect that can only be incompletely imagined. Many believe it to be staggeringly moving, though."
5,Spankophile's Delight,"If you like erotic spanking, chances are you will like this book. It doesn't really cohere as a novel, since it was originally published as short stories in a magazine. And it doesn't intersect with reality all that often. But as fantasies, Ms. Howard's vignettes definately worked for me."
5,A Spanking good read,"From the first page of this wonderful story I was hooked. I would stay up late to read it afraid to put it down as if the words would vanished and I would have this yearing left to see what happen to Susan or Micheal Flag. To see Damarias grow and learnin the lifestyle and to see the rather conservative Laura do some mighty big changes. In two days I read the whole book.I have always been fasinated with BDSM but was kind of scared with stories of Anne Rice out there... This book was homefed and real... I felt I heard the answer to my call. Thank you Eve, you are a goddess and the book was the best"
1,Worst read ever,Uninteresting charade of uninteresting characters. Flimsy storyline. Scenes that might have been intended to be erotic were the absolute opposite of erotic. I do not understand any of the positive reviews I have read.
1,Awful,Incredibly awful dialog and very unbelievable plot. So bad that I couldn't let myself go and fall into the story. Surely there must be something better in this genre.
3,His originally out of print book is better,"Not a bad book, but nothing spectacular either. Use the MAF formula (180-age pluses for other factors) and exercise with a HR below that. Okay, that is the summary of the book. If you are injured and tired all the time, this book is for you. If you are fast and can't seem to go longer distances this book is for you. If you are slow (sorry exercising at easier intensities) and want to be fast, this won't work."
1,Nothing High Performance Here,"This book doesn't hold a candle to Heart Monitor Training For the Compleat Idiot. If you're 50, sedentary and haven't worked out in 20 years, this book will be fine for the first 4 or 5 months."
2,Not Really a Book,"Our family loves Mo Willems' books, especially the pigeon books. However, this one falls far short. There is really no story, and it is only a few pages long. My son loves buses and trucks so I had hoped this would become one of his favorite books, but even he finds it boring."
3,Short on the Pigeon,"My daughter loves to read almost as much as I love to hear her read and it helps when we get to laugh in the process. The Pigeon books have become some of our favorites as the pigeon always seems to find a way to make my daughter laugh. The Pigeon loves things that go! (like The Pigeon has feelings too!) is a bit short; in length and in humor and I will be looking forward to another (longer/better) addition to the pigeon series in the future. I recommend that you take a look at this book at a local library, but avoid the buy. But please give Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!, The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog!, and Don't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late!a chance. You will be glad that you did."
1,Huge disappointment and rip-off for Willems fans,"This is not a board ""book,"" as another reviewer obeserved, but a collection of random drawings from other Willems books - and darn few of them. I wouldn't mind that there is no story, since I bought it for a 1-year old, but he was disappointed that there were so few pictures and pages. Willems and Hyperion should be ashamed of themselves for this shoddy, lazy piece of publishing."
3,Love the Pigeon,"Book is a ""smidgeon of pigeon"". A short book on things that Pigeon loves. Great for a beginning reader."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"My daughter is almost 3 & we already had 2 books by Mo Willems she LOVES- Don't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late & Edwina, the Dinosaur That Didn't Know She Was Extinct & I thought I couldn't go wrong. I did. I knew it was a board book & expected it to be short, but geez. Not much there at all. I still love Mo Willems' books & highly recommend the 2 above as well as Leonardo Was a Terrible Monster (which I ordered with this one). Skip it, you could do a lot better with another Willems title."
2,Why a board book that doesn't stand on its own?,"It seems to me that the board book format is designed for younger children than the original Pigeon books. Therefore, this book (and its companion, The Pigeon Has Feelings Too) should be able to stand alone and be read first. However, neither book makes much sense if you don't know the stories told in the originals.I am a librarian who ordered these board titles for a public library. My fear is that someone will find these books first and be turned off before they can discover the entertaining originals."
3,Very disappointing,"My young son and I are huge pigeon fans, having loved the first two books. When I saw that Willems was releasing two new pigeon books, I was very excited and ordered them immediately. Perhaps if I had waited, I would have seen that these are ""board books,"" i.e. only a few ""pages"" long. My son enjoyed ""reading"" the ""things that go"" (a bus, train, airplane and...hot dog?), and laughed at the appearance of the little duck in connection to the last item, but it was very short and forgettable. I guess it's a cute enough book, but know that it is just a ""smigeon of pigeon,"" not a full book."
2,boring,great bed time book its so boring it put us all to sleep - not a cool as the hot dog or dont let the pigeon drive the bus.Those are the only 2 titles worth buying
2,Wrong book every time!,"I ordered this book twice and Amazon sent me the wrong Pigeon book each time. Finally I gave up. I was reimbursed for the book and didn't have to send the second copy back, so I guess that was good. Someday I'll pick this book up at the book store and find out what I think of it!"
2,Board books are supposed to be for babies,"I am a fan of the larger Pigeon books, so I bought this one for my 18 month old who loves books. This was a disappointment as the play on words at the end makes little sense to a baby. This is a waste of money. The longer books are much more enjoyable."
2,"The Best in Help, Hope, and Healing!","As a former fallen pastor, I wish this book would have been available a decade ago. After doing years of research and helping other religious ""restorees,"" I believe ""Restoring the Fallen"" is the most comprehensive and insightful book on the market. The writers (multiple authors) convey workable truths obtained from practical experience. Every ""nook and cranny"" of restoration is dealt with in an easy-to-read and understandable style. These authors believe that there is life after a fall - and for religious leaders hurt by sin, it is needed help, hope and healing."
4,Helped save our marriage,"This is a very practical book for those supporting a recovering person. I should make clear that it is only for supporting those truly committed to their own recovery. The authors have experience in this area first hand as both recovering addicts & as their support team. As far as I am aware, this is the only book of it's kind. I highly recommend this book for after the initial shock of the addiction is out in the open when those involved are ready to take those next difficult steps toward getting better. My husband & I were able to share this book with our committed support team as a guideline for how best to help us reconcile. Though it was only a part of our recovery plan, this book was invaluable. Almost 4 years later, we are still in active recovery & still meeting with our recovery team on a regular basis. Huge thanks to the Wilsons for sharing their story!"
4,Interesting and helpful read,"This book will be very helpful for any one planning to be involved in a restoration group for someone who has fallen sexually. It reads like a case study from the perspective of the person being helped, Earl Wilson in this case. Although it has many authors listed, all but two chapters are written by Earl Wilson.The book is not very well written, but the story is compelling and some of the insights are like gold nuggets. The second appendix is an interview with Wilson's counselor, who is not a Christian, and is painful to read, but also insightful.Any church looking to use restoration groups to help those wrapped up in sexual immorality should definitely read this book."
3,Old stock,"Edit: Amazon refunded my money without any questions. I am happy I got it from Amazon! :)I am a regular user of Guess. I've been buying it on perfumania so far. This is my first time on Amazon.I received the perfume, and my favorite Guess had a pungent odor. I sprayed it on my hand for a second, and when I sniffed at it, I was stunned for a second due to its STRONG pungent odor. Its clearly been on the shelves for too long! And guess what? You cannot return this item to Amazon since you cannot ship back flammable stuff."
5,Awesome!,"One of my favorite colognes, but for my wife, it's her absolute favorite. Drives her crazy. It's a fragrance that isn't overpowering, yet can stand out within a crowd. Amazon's price is a little more than half off of what Macy will charge her."
4,Great Guess,"I like this product from Guess v much, this is my 2nd bottle. Lasts till end of my work day."
4,Excellent scent. Refreshing AND not too boring!,"This scent has the perfect amount of balance in my opinion. Its fresh, but not so fresh that it smells like Axe spray. Its also got the perfect level of musk which isn't found often in colognes. This leaves you wanting more and more without being overpowering or having a foul or unfamiliar scent. This decisively masculine scent is a perfect balance between unique taste and refreshment. However balanced this scent is, it doesn't last as long as I would like, but its cheap price almost makes up for that."
2,read it before purchasing,this product was not as i expected it to be.this perfume has very light smell which wont last more than 30 minutes...u can hardly smell it fragnance...so i wont recommend this product....
3,It's ok to me,"This fragrances is ok to me, although is not the best that i had buy. Smell strong and have good price."
2,Just get a single perfume,"Make the purchase, the debited from my credit card and I get just a perfume of the two that came in this package."
3,My wife liked it,"Smells nice and its not too strong, stays subtle. It doesn't last throughout the day though. Overall a good buy online compared to the local stores."
5,Top Quality,My wife likes using wooden kitchen utensils and she tells me this is one of the best she's ever seen.I do cook also and I'm not a fan of wooden utensils but I will say that this is a good heavy duty spoon that you will never find in a discount store. We should get many years of use out of it unless it's abused and I think it could stand up to a bit of abuse.
2,Crack in spoon after one use.,"The spoon developed a one inch crack after only one use. It is still useable, but I'm disappointed in the quality."
1,"Basically, it's just JUNK","Unreliable electronics that 'locks up' and requires removal of the batteries to free it up for use. The camera part takes a picture that is offset from what you are looking at through the binocular: i.e. look at a building through the binocular that fills the field of view and take a picture of it. You only get the top half of the building and half a frame of sky. I returned the first pair shipped due to this defect, and the second pair is just as bad. Will return for a full refund and find another brand.Peter"
1,Bushnell Imageview is junk,"I can't believe Bushnell put their name on this worthless junk. The eye pieces do not close far enough for either me or my mate. It takes pictures so slowly that they are all blurry. If you are so lucky to be taking a still picture using a tripod and a release cable, you will get a fair picture. It eats batteries about every 20 pictures. It will only accept an out-dated 1 gig SD card - Very hard to find today. The picture is NOT taken through the binocular's optics. The camera portion uses one simply (and tiny) lens focused at infinity. I am not sure what to do with my pair - garbage or simply keep them around to remind me what junk Bushnell will label as their own. Amazing!"
2,Not worth it,"There is no excuse for cutting out every other important scene. I have seen most of the 1st sesaon, however since I only got univision (not telemundo) on my antennae and it aired a 2pm, I did miss some inbetween. Go to best buy and look at any Season DVD of a TV series (i.e, CSI, Friends, etc.) they cost more than 20 bucks. I would have been happier paying more and getting the whole season than what i got. each disk is a stream of scenes from the show, that while in order, miss important events, etc. If they didn't want to charge people more than 20 bucks for the disks, than they should have split up the season into 2 dvd packs, i guarantee people are going to buy it.About the english subtitles, yes they have them and they are pretty well done."
2,i'm disappointed.,"I am giving this a low rating because it has too much missing from it, too edited and cut scenes.I would rather watch this on Youtube or wait until I go to Mexico to buy the full series.It is difficult to follow the storyline and I do not recommend buying this unless you remember the series by heart and don't care too miss a lot.The episodes never end and you don't know when a new episode starts or ends."
3,Not as good as the normal novela.,"Season 1 was the longest of all the 3 seasons of Rebelde and in order to fit it into 3 CD's many scenes were taken out. This makes it harder for someone who didn't watch the novela when it originally aired to fully understand the plot line, since it jumps around and skips some character intro's, etc. It jumps around skipping parts in the the ""Logia"" plot, the whole Teo make-over, Nico & Lupita's relationship just to name a few."
2,I did not get this exact product,"My biggest gripe with this DVD set is that I did not get the product that is advertised in this ad. The product I received had no english subtitles. In fact even the front cover is different.Aside from that. My other gripe with this is that it is too edited, I did see the original airing of this show and it is amazing how liberal they were with the editing and cutting."
3,English Subtitles?,"Not a review-but a question/comment-Is this dvd subtitled in English, I can't seem to find the info. If it isn't-Why? I'm sure there are quite a few people that would buy this and possibly other tv novellas if they were available in english subtitles"
4,Broad view of job search,A nice book if some one wants a broad view on the acad job search..worth the money..
3,A little disappointing for my needs,"Some will find this book a help, but for finding a job in a hurry, I think it was a bit lacking. If you have plenty of time, it is ok."
3,Replacement part,"Worked as expected. Not much else to say about the product, except that I now have a new shaver - another remington."
4,decent replacement!!!,"Good replacement head for this model razor. Really sharp at first, but as with most of this style it gradually loses the keen edge feel. better to order 2 or more to have them available"
5,Perfect fit,The cutters were a perfect fit. It took me longer to open the package than to install the new cutters. They give a nice shave.
1,Very Disappointing,"This is the first review I've written but I find I need to warn readers interested in this book. I have to agree with Suzanne Kelly's review. I can't believe any woman who had been drugged, abducted, impregnated, manipulated, treated as a pawn, and betrayed in every way imaginable by her boss, friend, doctor and protector/lover (4 different people) in order to save a handful of people from a virulent virus would forgive and forget. Even for such an important cause. I guess there would have been no story if they had just asked for her help instead of removing all her free agency and rights. As I was reading the book I just knew the person orchestrating this manipulation couldn't be her love interest. I suffered through the whole book and was thoroughly disgusted by the end. I had purchased 2 other Forster books with this one but returned them without reading them. I won't be reading any Forster books again."
3,Forster Fizzles,"Ok, I admit, I bought this book because of the cover. Those eyes on that guy said...""Pick me up!"" After that, I found the plot interesting but the cut & paste aspect of the writing & editing let me down.In ""Morning After"", Ms. Forster gives us Temple Banning and her new life of marriage, pregnancy & evolving danger. Temple does not remember it at all. Is it hers? Or are there demons at work here? Again the plot is good. If you like a quick summer read with intrigue & some romance, this is for you.if you find my comments interesting, please click the ""yes""--thanks--CDS"
2,Lack of sizzle and a flat story,"Temple Banning awakes in a strange hotel room to find that she has a husband she does not recall and he has disappeared without a trace. She hires wealthy and powerful investigator Mark Challis to unravel the mystery, and is soon taken into protective custody when several attempts are made on her life upon discovering she is pregnant.Secluded in his home with a strange housekeeper (shades of Mrs. Danvers from ""Rebecca""), Temple starts investigation on her own as well and finds that her predicament may be related to a deadly African virus which ravaged her parents, but she miraculously survived. As Mark attempts to keep her at arm's length, Temple is not sure if he is her savior or someone to fear.Forster flat story never really catches much momentum. It is not difficult to figure out the identity of her ""husband,"" and the lack of requisite Forster sizzle keeps this story from making much of an impact, and is difficult to retain the reader's attention."
2,"GREAT STORY LINE, BUT.....","I read this story in one night only to find the end disappointing. The book begin with a great mystery. The herionwakes up in a hotel alone and married. she does not any memory of the night before. From there it's too much to believe that she is a 30 year virgin who is now pregnant, doesn't remember how, and never goes to the police. When she is referred to Mark for help, she trusts this stranger with her life even though she has doubts about him. At the end when she finds out who was behind everything and why, she forgives what every women would find TOTALLY unforgiveable. This book reminds me of a 19th century romance novel right down to the castle."
1,So Disappointing,"The first part of the book was very interesting. The premise was intriguing, and I wanted to know what had happened to the heroine to put her in such a predicament. However, the second half of the book was an incredible let-down. The plot spun wildly out of control, I completely lost touch with the hero, and I thought the heroine completely unbelieveable - particularly her turnaround regarding the hero at the very end of the book. I'm more than willing to suspend my disbelief if the story is good, but I want it to make sense within the parameters of the world you have to buy into for that to happen. The characters completely lost me, the love-hate thing with the hero's father was completely incomprehensible, as were the hero's motivations regarding his actions toward the heroine. A definite wall-banger."
2,"Interesting plot device, uninteresting book","The idea of a woman waking up married and pregnant with no memories of the events resulting in those conditions was an intriguing plot line. Unfortunately, Suzanne Forster's book does not deliver the promised intrigue, mystery and romance. The book is slow. The reader wanders, bewildered, through the opening events, and understanding comes tediously, at glacial speed. The hero seems to be a strong sexy character, but, in the end, is disappointingly weak. A number of plot elements, tiny clues that seem to have meaning, are not explained. The entire premise of the book, when all is revealed, is unrealistic. The book was a chore to read, and does not make me eager to read more of this author's work."
1,Premise was great...unfortunately the story went nowhere.,"I was going to give this book two stars, but it didn't live up to that. Sorry. It had a great premise. Amnesia has been over-done, but the cover blurb and advertisements seemed so exciting.....Plus the fact that I had enjoyed Ms. Forster's Previous books. Blush for one. Unfortunately this book, ""The Morning After"" did not stand up to some of her previous books.It was barely suspenseful and somewhat confusing. It actually bordered on irritating. The mystery dragged out way to long. As for the Romance...where was it? When the couple, Temple and (sorry, I can't remember the hero's name) finally do get together during the last quarter of the book, Ms. Forster does a fade to black...What happend? Ms. Forster usually writes wonderful and sensual love scenes. The only love scene in the book, and we are left wondering! I really wanted to like this book. I love a good Romantic Suspense. This was not a good one, in my opinon."
4,Exciting but confusing,"While this book was very interesting, I felt cheated after I had read it. The story was confusing, contradictory, and the ending uncomfortable."
3,"Some good information, bad structure","This book has some good information on money supply, various views on economic stimulation, margins affected by commodity prices and more. The problem with the book though is a big one: the author is literally all over the place. His thoughts are not structured enough to make an argument in a compelling rational way. He consistently says things that sound like ""you too can make money, here's how!"". Then he contradicts himself by claiming that others discount the event-risk based news that he spends so much time talking about in the book.This book is unorganized, but has some interesting information, although you really need to get through his tiring writing style and structure in order to get to it."
3,Decent once Gomadic finally gets a working product to you .....,I have to say that this is one of the worst brand names i have bought from. First they send me a a defective charger. Also in the shipment was a tip that went to a Dell laptop computer that I didn't even own. Then they ship me a new charger and then i find out from them that my tip is non function because of a firmware change Creative just did. Well just great.... They then send me a new tip works then they send me another one of the same type!?!?!?!? After this huge mess i finaly got it working and I have to say its pretty good for what you get. It does charge much faster than the PC. Average PC charge is approx. 3-4 hours. Wall charger is 1-2 1/2. So it is good and it is portable but man does this company need to get their shipping management worked out.
5,Skywalker Walks Tall,"Three cheers for the new David Thompson book. As an afficianado of NBA history myself, it is great to see some of the top players of the past getting their due. David's story is one to learn from...about how a person can raise himself up from almost nothing to a premier position in life, only to see it all evaporate. Yet he has risen up once again to find a new beginning and a willingness to share his experiences. It goes a long way to taking away the self-created tarnish from his star.Besides the personal narrative of David's, I enjoyed the prologue by Bill Walton (can almost seeing him deliver it on air) and the excellent photos.I can recommend this book to basketball fans everywhere.Enjoy."
3,Nice Basket For 4,Nice basket but very expensive. I probably would not have spent so much if my grandchild did not have her heart set on a basket for four.
2,Needs dozens of holes to choose from,"The designers of this product are massively overly optimistic about how consistent attics joists are placed. In my ""24 inch OC"" attic some of the spacing's were 21 inches and others were 25+. (It's the nature of an attic - it's not that critical to get them perfectly accurate). Why don't they put drillable holes all in the product so it can be more flexible??? Seems like a no-brainer, but you only gave me 5 or 6 holes to use. Grrrr. I tried to submit a comment at the Manufacture's webpage but it seemed broken. (Kept saying I needed a subject when I had entered a subject)"
4,Attic tire review,Simple to use and install. Very effective and light solution for maximizing space in an attic. A little pricey.
3,Attic Dek 24 x 16 review,"Great product, but not worth the price. The 8 pack of Attic Dek 16 x16 inch panels has more value in my opinion because of the amount of added space it provides. The 4 Pack of 24 x 16 Inch Attic Dek panels does not add enough space for the price you pay."
1,Not a good idea to use your Attic for Storage,"Don't use your attic for storage. It cuts down your blown insulation ""R"" value. It will reduce the insulation because you are compressing the insulation down, and that brings your ""R"" value to a lower value."
3,"well-presented, no concepts","The techniques are described only in terms how to move, not why. None of the concepts of hung gar are introduced. Even the most basic principles are left out. The structure of the form isn't discussed. Combinations are not highlighted. Although there are ample ""applications"", in many cases they are fairly obvious. Fu Hok deserves a deep and detailed publication. Once again, this is not it.All that being said, this book is a good, inexpensive reference for the the outward gestures of the form. Although without details regarding these gestures, its usefulness is severely limited.I've heard that the video doesn't include the form, so ""caveat emptor"""
5,Comedy,"Never saw this when it first came on tv, but have really enjoyed it since purchasing it on Amazon."
5,A blast from the past,"Oh, how I loved to watch SOAP when it first aired. My entire family would congregate in the living room and laugh away. Recently, my family discovered this dvd series. I was thrilled to see the show stands the test of time and still enthralls my children as much as it did me. The show has also triggered intelligent questions from my children regarding sociological issues dealt with in SOAP. It is also just a hoot!"
5,Where is Season Three?,"I have both seasons and my family really enjoyed all the episodes. Now we are left hanging for the next two seasons! C'mon people, publish Season THREE!!!!"
4,Fondly Remembered Show and Season,"As a thirteen year old in 1978, I discovered Soap thanks to the hype in TV Guide towards the end of the first season. The recap episode before season 2 helped me catch up on what I missed during the summer reruns. But it was season 2, the season on this DVD, is when I first started watching faithfully each week.At the time, due to the mature content (tame by today's standards but very mature in the late 70's), the show aired after 9pm EST. Since this was after my bed time, I would pretend to go to sleep. When air time came, I'd turn on my portable black and white TV (in the dark with the volume low) and sit close to take the show in. I was hooked!This show is both very funny and very touching. Susan Harris was a master at the scripts. The cast was talented and multi-faceted. This is a classic comedy whose storylines are still very viewable and enjoyable today.Can't wait for the rest of the seasons! This is one show I'll be happy to own the entire run for."
4,GILLAN THE GOD!,"Ian Gillan: an endless source of musical creation, not only in the hard rock genre, but with a lot of its subgenres. The guy is involved in all the compositions for his various different catalogues (DEEP PURPLE, IAN GILLAN BAND, GILLAN, IAN GILLAN, GILLAND & GLOVER); the guy can sing softly and can scream terribly loud; the guy performs live with confidence and inspiration; he never sold out to openly mainstream music.Introduction gone, I must say GLORY ROAD is a masterpiece, along with MR. UNIVERSE. His band here is at full speed, full of confidence and brilliantism. Perfect."
2,Not his best...,"GLORY ROAD is not the best GIllan hard rock album. Its sucessor, 1981's FUTURE SHOCK, is a lot more mature and is better.Also, the bonus tracks here are a waste of time, it only serves to destroy the atmosphere of the original album, theatmosphere of a band that was reaching its peak and beginning to headline arenas all over Europe."
2,Too many typographical errors,"I purchased this book several years ago. The book is well thought out and presents the syntax in an easy to understand way. However, the book was not carefully proofread. There are too many errors in the Greek and English text. Many Greek words are misspelled and some of the illustrative sentences are incomplete. The text suddenly ends when there shoud be more text to complete the translation from the Greek cited. I teach Biblical Greek and would not recommend that my students purchase the book. My edition is 1995."
3,Can be helpful in addition to Wallace,"This is a fairly simple Greek grammar. In comparison to Wallace, he briefly describes the function, or case, and then supplements it with many examples. There are a plethora of references cited, so it is probable that one could find a reference to a difficult passage which one struggling with. It is not only beneficial for that but also to reinforce what one is learning in Wallace.You still would want to purchaseD. B. Wallace's (Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics [Hardcover])(1997)"
2,SMALL BAG,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE BAG ARRIVED, SINCE I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT THIS IS REALLY A 'SMALL BAG'. AND THE COLOR, THE PINK IS QUITE DARK.."
5,A Classic,"An absolute classic. No praise can do justice. Suffice to say, if you're here, you'll buy this book. It's just sad that so few people have even heard of anything written by Alan Moorehead apart from the two books on the White and Blue Nile."
3,But it works...,"If I had been able to see one of these smokers in the store I would not have bought it. It seems poorly made and doesn't fit together very well. But since I bought it and went to the trouble of putting it together, we gave it a try. It works! We've used it every weekend since we got it - ham, chicken, sausage - everything is great. I don't know how long this thing is going to last, but I'm going to use it until it falls apart - then buy something else."
1,Meco 5031,Product is made from cheap materials. I have used three times and it does not meet any of the stated model. I would not recommend anyone try this. The cheap models from Home Depot work 100% better.
2,Poorly Made!,"I have not yet used this smoker, so I can only comment on the aesthetics of this product. It was easy enough to put together, but extremely poorly made. First of all, it arrived damaged. I'm not sure whose fault that was, although I saw no evidence of damage on the box and I read at least one other review that stated it arrived damaged. There was a huge dent on one side of the smoker. My husband had to knock the dent out with a hammer, since I intended to use it for Thanksgiving and wouldn't have had time to send it back. Although as it turned out, I didn't use it. The material it's made of is very flimsy and the seams didn't match up on one side, making insertion of the screws difficult. As another reviewer stated, if I had seen this smoker in a store first, I definitely would not have purchased it."
2,Am I missing something?,"I cannot believe this book has received an average of five stars. Am I missing something? I am a huge fan of romance novels and very discriminating when it comes to a story line. The main characters are at least somewhat feasible, but Conrad and Thelma? Come on! They didn't never have really talked to each other and then suddenly they supposedly fell in love with each other in about a week? And the similes! Dear god, if I had to read one more simile I was going to tear my eyes out. Maybe it's just me (after all, I am a northerner), but I find it hard to believe that such phrases as "" hotter than a june bug in july"" and ""happier than pigs in mud"" are tacked onto nearly EVERY sentence spoken by a southerner. Maybe I am wrong about that, but I didn't think this book was that great."
5,Wonderful Romantic Comedy!,"Ryan O'Fallon and Effie Wilson deserve this delightfully sexy story! A fast-paced book, laugh-out-loud funny, and must go on your keeper shelf! I look forward to more of Dianne Castell's books."
3,I'd give it 3 1/2,"Fun, quick read. I liked the characters and the storyline. My problem was with the motivation. Parts of the book read like an outline. If it was time for a character to change his ways or his mind, he did. No struggle, no looking back. When one guy learns that his best friend for over thirty years is gay, he is surprised. Then the story moves on without discussion. When it's time for the bad guy to be good, he is."
2,Different,"I read the other reviews that this was the wrong photo. Frankly, i did not believe the feedback form other purchasers. Well I received my chlorinator. It is NOT what is pictured. I must say though, that it is the Hayward CL100. Although I believe a CL200 is pictured. That is what I thought I was ordering. I installed the unit anyway as my old unit was shot. It seems to work ok. However, it is difficult to load 3"" tablets in the bowl. They are hard to gently insert. Time will tell just how well this unit works. I think it will be ok. Thus the 2 seat rating...just ok."
