3,"Don't expect another ""Braveheart""","This movie stars Mel Gibson leading men to war, but it is noteven close to Gibson's masterful ""Braveheart."" I know hedidn't direct this movie, and that may have been half the problem.There are no stellar battle scenes in ""The Patriot,"" thekind that make you just shut up and take in the action. The scenesinbetween the action are many. Too many, in fact. The effect theRevolutionary War had on family life is interesting, but not enough tosustain 2 hours of story telling.The backdrop was good. Thecostume designers and set designers deserve attention, almost as muchas the set/costume designers on 2001. This isn't as bad as mostHollywood tripe, but with a few changes could have had been nominatedfor some major Oscars."
5,The best Movie I have seen in a long time,"This movie was incredable. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger give outstanding performances in this movie and truly pull your heart strings. The plot is basicly Mel Gibson hates war (we learn the reason why later in the movie) and is outraged when his eldest of 7 children, Gabriele, in lists in the revolutionary war. He later comes back with a flesh wound and is recooperating at home when the enemy attacks the Martin home. Mel's second oldest son Thomas attempts to save his brother from severe punishment and is killed. Now Mel Gibson seeks revenge on the enemy. I cried laughed and really thought while watching this movie. I would reccomend it to anyone."
5,I liked it!,"It is hard to seperate yourself from the main character emotionally, after he is thrust into the conflict. Having grown children, made it easy for me to feel this man's anguish. I have watched this several times, and have yet to not shed tears when he beats the British brutally in the first confrontation, in front of his children. It isn't about politics or Patriotism at all. It is about being pushed to ones limits and reacting as would be expected when your family is miserably and deleberatly slaughtered. It is about the darker side of humananities instinct.Yes there is violence, it is about war after all. The sound of muskets firing is as realistic as the machine guns firing and casings dropping to the ground in Saving Private Ryan. It was very realistic and demonstrative of the evils of war. The lesson to be learned, is that violence is a sacred sacrafice that should only be used when there is no other alternative! It is well done and very interesting at all times!"
1,Not Just Bad But Indecent,"One of the most immoral movies of recent memory, not simply because it distorts crucial history and manipulates emotions in a way that cheapens them, but because of its breathtakingly gratuitous violence. The protagonist, whom we are supposed to admire, in front of his young son hacks to death another man and continues hacking until he, the protagonist, is himself covered in blood. This is not heroism but psychosis."
1,The most biast and historically incorrent film ever made!,"The acting is poor, the story is both historically incorrent and increadibly bias, and at times the film is so cringing corny that you have to either turn away or be physically sick. Mel Gibson (australian) seems to have some sort of issue with the British looking at both this poor excuse for a film and braveheart. He tries to exibit them as an evil empire comitting constant atrocities (which never actually happened). Seeing that most of us are from british origins and also from the same gene pool, along with the fact that their probably are only real allies, we should really give them more respect, obviously films like this dont help..."
1,Mel's second attempt at the Braveheart formula.,"This is such a blatant attempt to recreate the boxoffice success Gibson had with Braveheart, a second-rate film in itself. The formula, as Gibson obvioulsy learned from Braveheart, is to make an epic-looking flick with a good buddy system, eternally constipated seriousness, and a lot of shouting. Presumably, all these measure the manhood in Gibson's dictionary.Come to think of it, it's not a Gibson-specific phenomenon. Rather, it's a Hollywood-wide mentality. If a particular theme works in one movie, then let's do it over and over and over, and over, till it rots and stinks.Sorry Mel, gotta to be a bit more original than this."
1,Laughable!,Any student of American history will be alternately cringing and laughing through this movie...if you can sit through the whole thing! Should be called-How Mel Gibson Single-handedly Won the American Revolution...not worth the tape it's printed on...
1,Sickening,"Glory, pride and an easy win, Typical! Like any other history loving person this film just makes me wanna gag, not only is it incredably inaccurate as far as every historian is concened, it also (as usual) makes us brits look like butchers! We had the most highly trained and well diciplined army in the world, the only reason the Americans won was because of the fact that we were already fighting a war with France, spain etc and as a result only a quarter of our army were actualy over there.I am 15 and considered gullable to this yanky propaganda, well i say anyone who is taken into this film should be considered dumb or racist as we are portayed as nazi type figures and its so WRONG!!!!! Please send me your thoughts on this review."
1,An Embarrassment and a Waste of Time,"I've had conversations with hand puppets that have been more stimulating. I love the PC-correct slaves ""our master pays us"" and the mute daughter ""Poppa!"" The scene where Gibosn makes the faulty chair while all the slaves and family watch thru the slats is truly sad. Ridiculous, redundant and reprehensible. Remember when Mel Gibson made good movies? Where have you gone Mad Max?"
2,"It just isn't Braveheart, it shouldn't try to be...","Another movie where the best part happens in about 30 minutes, than its all downhill from there. It would of been alot better, if they'd knocked off that hour of boredom, they really went over board with the plot development."
2,Independence Day + Braveheart = The Patriot,"This movie really disappointed me! First of all, I am not an american citizen, and therefore this movie doesn't manipulate my national feelings...If you put ID4 and Braveheart (the fighting scenes) together, then you end up with ""The Patriot"". I love ID4 and Braveheart, but I didn't like this one. Why Mel Gibson in this movie?? They could just as well have hired Steven Seagal or Arnold Schwarzenegger, 'cause this would be the perfect role for them. If you're american, then you may like this one, but I guarantee you that you easily will forget the movie within those nearly 3 hours it lasts. It's just TOO american, and that is NOT a compliment for a movie nowadays..."
2,A Bad History Lesson,"Director Roland Emmerich and Producer Dean Devlin? Do you recognize those names? They brought us Independence Day and Godzilla. Two of the worst movies of the nineties in my humble opinion. Now they are giving us a history lesson in the form of The Patriot. This movie has good sets, neat costumes, and good computer graphics. This movie does not have originality, good acting, or the convictions of it's own plotline. The movie is similiar to Braveheart, another Gibson movie. Again Gibson plays a man of peace turned savage when a loved one is murdered. As for the acting, forget it. Yes, Mel Gibson is a likeable screen presence, but he cannot carry this film. The rest of the actors are horrible, especially that broad who plays Heath Ledger's love interest. In thier defense, the actors can only do so much with bad dialogue and a hack director. If you want an intellingent historical movie, go for the 1989 movie Glory. If you want a Mel Gibson historical piece, watch Braveheart again."
2,Not one of Mel's better movies ...,"I think I'm one of the few people who found this movie incredibly boring, cookie cutter, and lacking imagination. I got up several times during the movie, left the room, and came back, to find that I didn't seem to miss much at all, except some pretty poor dialogue. I'm sure the actors did the best they could with what was given them, but the writing was just awful."
4,The Patriot-review,"As the Patriot himself was based on at least three different colonial frontiersmen I believe it calls into question the historical accuracy of the story. The story itself is well written though, and the movie is well acted,the cast was well picked, and Mel Gibson actually made me feel as if he were fighting a battle inside himself up until he was pulled into the fray. The movie was well directed, and the cinematography was excellent. Again the quality of the picture as well as that of the sound was excellent."
4,Blu-Ray Quality (Short n Simple),I recently added this to my Blu-Ray collection. The sound is 5 stars. The video quality is 4 stars. Some of the extended scenes had quite a few black specs that were distracting. The detail in 85% of the film was spot on though. Worth upgrading from DVD.
4,loved it!!!!!!,"I loved this movie. I mean one or two of the parts of the movie were kinda corny (The slave island,the ink tea). But all in all this was a really good movie. The music was good, the acting was good (almost all of it anyway) the story was good IT WAS JUST A GOOD MOVIE!!!! Would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,Just decent,"While I am a huge fan of such epic movies, I was rather disappointed with this movie. This obvious Braveheart take off was completely unvelievable from a historical view and all the characters seem to be either entirely good or evil with no middle ground. Only purchase this film if you already have Braveheart, Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, Last of the Mohicans and every other decent similar movie. Otherwise, this is a definite rent first film."
4,"Good Movie, Good Price","This story is akin to Braveheart in that it stars Mel Gibson in another epic movie, and that they go whomp the English. Also like Braveheart, that acting is quite good, the visuals are amazing, and, of course, all of the nit pickers out there found something wrong with it. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not 3 hour long documentaries!I really like this movie. The only thing I would have changed was the pacing of the film. It still could have been very good if the director had chopped 45 minutes or so from the film. There were some scenes that I thought were uneeded.At ... (which is one of the cheapest new-movie DVD's I've seen) The Patriot is a very entertaining war epic worth buying."
3,Braveheart Redone,"Yes, it was. Braveheart taken to a different century and country. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same movie. -Shrugs.- I think Mel has something against the English.Oddly enough, the best part of this movie was the English, vilified character of Colonel William Tavington, played by one of my top two actors, Jason Isaacs. Isaacs has always been a phenomenal actor, and this time, I think, he saved this movie from flopping.The coolest thing about this movie was Tavington's Green Dragoons... or was it his long silky brown hair... or was it his accent? Hmm. It's a little of everything, I think.Anyway. Great movie for the sake of seeing Isaacs in another awesome role.Gibson? Not so much. See Braveheart."
4,The movie is great...not so sure the extra 10 is worth $15.,"First of, The Patriot itself is a great movie with a captivating story...no doubt did it make an interesting story around the events of the revolutionary war (And a partly true story at that)...However, If you ALREADY have The Patriot on DVD...you probably don't want to pop $15 over for this. Why? At only 10 extra minutes (Some scenes are extended by a minute, some have a few seconds added here or there), it's not much of a leap. It's not like they took all of the deleted scenes from the actual first DVD and threw them in. But, if you have seen ""The Patriot"" before and want it on DVD...why not go for this? This is a nice edition to your collection. But if you already have The Patriot...it's best avoid this. As for me, I used to own the original, but lost it and stumbled across this, and figured ""Why not"". I'm happy to have it, but learned if I still had my original and bought this...I would be wondering why I did."
3,"Presentation 10, Originality 0","""Formulaic"" might be the word to describe THE PATRIOT.All the elements of BRAVEHEART are present. The death of a loved one by an Englishman, the revenge, the capture, the escape, a bit of cunning, a lot of bloodshed and, oh yes, Gibson manages to win the war.It is sad that the comparison comes so easily, because in it's own right THE PATRIOT is a passable movie; Gibson fans will delight at his usual tough-yet-cute-as-a-baby characterization of the protaganist and action lovers will thrill at the excellent battle scenes.But the bitter truth remains, THE PATRIOT is little more than a rehash of BRAVEHEART."
4,Great war movie,"This was one of the few movies made about the revolutionary war. I think this film ranks right up there with ""Braveheart"" This is a true epic movie from start to finish."
2,The Patriot,"The movie itself was not very good. It was very cheesy and did not follow a constant theme. One minute it is love story, war story, or revenge story. I was half-way through the film and turned it off. If you like corny and cheesy movies this is one for you. I take Gladiator over this one 100 to 1."
1,As inaccurate as Braveheart,"I was very, very disappointed by ""Braveheart"" - magnificent as a piece of cinema, but a disgraceful mangling of the real story of my country's greatest hero. But ""Patriot"" takes the biscuit - Gibson confuses the 18th C. British Army with the Waffen SS!One star is one too many."
1,Skip this movie,"This movie is like Braveheart ""Lite"". I'm a big Mel Gibson fan, but this movie was boring. You can appreciate the depiction of what it may have been like to be internally conflicted over going to war with mother-England, but that is about it.The battle scenes don't make it interesting. The love stories and all characters are undeveloped so you don't really know why they are doing particular things or even care. Of course, historically, you don't gain any insight either. (Braveheart at least made you want to read more about the actual people and compare the movie's depiction of them.) Overall, it is really shallow and not the least bit believable. Skip this one."
1,what is wrong with the murkiness of real life?,"Why does hollywood have to be so black and white. Would it not be more interesting to try to understand the ambious nature of conflict. Instead we are treated with a ridiculous pantomime that should only fool a child. Apart from the Slavery issue, there are too many inaccuracies; where are the Scottish and Irish Soldiers in the British ranks - they were the majority in this era. If Mel Gibson could dispatch British troops so easily, why then did the war drag on for nearly a decade. Why is it that counter-insurgency conflicts are so muddy, brutal and full of civil conflct - except for Mels? Grow up and learn to deal with the real nature of war."
2,Not Worth Much,"Combine the sacarine of Little House on the Prarie with the bravado of Braveheart and you get the Patriot. Manipulative, lacking character development, it results in a big 'who cares?' Compared to work like Glory or Gettysburg, this is totally forgettable. Gibson's stilted portrail of 'Braveheart meets the British' is astonishingly poor...I don't for a minute believe in his limited romantic interests. John Williams' worst music score in years does not help (he really has no clue how to write for the battle scenes in this film); it should win an award for the ultimate in pretentious, clueless scoring. They could easily have removed an hour of boredom from the film, which remarkably builds up to nothing at the end."
1,The Most Racist Film Ever,"Ridiculously racist and historically inaccurate anti-English rubbish -aptly describes The Patriot. As a even more anti-British remake of Brave Heart this deeply offensive film should be made illegal on the charge of racism.The actions of the Nazis have been transposed onto English in a typical Hollywood distortion of history.In reality the British lost America, the Americans did not win it. As a result of the madness of King George III.More to the point the British soldiers-much more well trained and elitie than any Americans- were outnumbered 10 to 1."
4,Not for the kiddies...,"Beautiful Sets. Wonderfully acted by Gibson, Ledger, and many others. One of Ledger's best. Seemed very realistic, but I was not there, so what would I know? :) Gibson played the parts of a father and a soldier very well. I would recomend it for anyone who can watch innocent die, blood and guts. Enjoy the movie!"
3,Not So Good,I think the Patriot is the worst war movie.The acting is awful.The war scenes are terrible.The whole movie is so Boring!
4,The Patriot,The product arrived in very good condition and it arrived in a very short period of time. I would buy a product from this seller again
1,Miserable,"If your buying this DVD as a gift, or if you haven't seen the film, I would strongly recommend that you rent it first. Unless you can detach yourself from the characters in the film, you will not enjoy it, because everybody suffers painfully. The films demographic is definitely male 18-35, with graphic violence, digitally generated imagery of arms, legs and even heads being blown off by cannons, and the depiction of the burning of helpless women and children. Although well acted this film is devoid of tenderness and many will feel they've just wasted 2 hours of their life watching it."
3,It was ok,"This movie was ok, but was certainly no blockbuster or 5 star flick. Mel Gibson is a fantastic actor, but got too emotional in this one. His oldest son was annoying and didn't really make me care if he died or not. I also didn't understand how the rebels could even put up a fight. For most of the movie they only had like 8 soldiers. There should have been more action on the battlefields in this move if they werent going to have any characters or dialogue worth watching. Don't get me wrong, it was somewhat entertaining, but shouldnt be on anyones favorite list."
4,one of a kind,this was a great movie...the best civil war movie i have seen in along time...mel gibson was great...
2,Laughably Silly.,"Viewed: 6/05Rate: 36/05: The Patriot is a cheesy extension of Braveheart. There is too much emphasis on ripping off Michael Mann's Last of the Mohicans, David Lean's works, William Wyler's Ben-Hur, and Edward Zwick's Legends of the Fall and Glory. It is so easy to identify the poor copies when comparing the action scenes to Last of the Mohicans. The story is boring. The acting is laughable. Well, everything about this film is totally laughable. I laughed literally when they burned down the church. Why not substitute Tim Roth for Tavington character? I could believe more. Heath Ledger is so poor in this film, resembling much of a cardboard-like kid. Mel Gibson, I know he can do better than this lurid piece of work."
2,You gotta be kidding?!,"This movie has so many flaws that it makes it almost a joke more than anything. The dialog is horrible, the acting is second rate, and the plot is so bad that you can tell exactly what is going to happen the entire 3 hours. Not only that but the movie is horribly unrealistic. Really, do yo think that Mel Gibson's character could take down 30 guys with about 5 shots and a hatchet? It's bad enough this happens, but it happens over and over again. No one has this many lives. Sure the movie Die Hard did the same thing, but it was meant to be funny the way he couldn't die, and he joked about it too. This movie has some redeaming points in the fact that the full scale battles are fun to look at, but the other 2 and a half hours are just a waste of your time. you're better off renting this movie because chances are you won't want to watch this 3 hour bore more than once."
2,God bless Australia,"Plucky and unusually enlightened Australian farmer saves downtrodden Americans from villainous Brits.To misquote Henry Ford ""Hollywood History is bunk"""
5,My Favorite Movie,"No matter how many times I watch this movie,I never get bored with it. There are enough little things in the plot that you will notice something new every time you see it. While not completely historically accurate, the plot is still compelling. The acting is great! Each person is completely in character. I fell in love with this movie and I hope that you do too!"
3,Historical Garbage plus Braveheart,"This film was historically inaccurate.... Although war is horrible and many atrocities and war crimes take place, it is wrong to place them into a movie you portray as historical. The action scenes were good and at times unpredictable, but the story was a little too like ""Braveheart."" Mel Gibson was the only reason this movie made money.See the movie but don't purchase it."
4,Good times,We decided to make it a tradition to watch this every fourth of July. Still pretty sad about Adam Baldwin though.
3,More action than accuracy,"The patriot is another huge scale, high budget film done by Mel Gibson. This movie is comparable to Braveheart because it seems that it uses the same type of formula Braveheart did. They just applied it to the Revolutionary War period of time. The movie (just like Braveheart) contains a good mix of action, battle scenes and compassion. This movie can be enjoyed by males and females alike. Beware.. this movie is not for Revolutionary War buffs. The historical innaccuracies will turn this enjoyable movie experience into a game that consists of picking out everything that is wrong. This alone will extinguish any entertainment value for that person and anybody watching it with them."
3,"A Good movie, but a bit long",I enjoyed the Patriot. It was a good movie but a bit long. I always enjoy the costumes for the period as well as the special effects in the battle scenes.
2,American Braveheart,"If you liked Braveheart, but thought the ending was a downer, then get this dvd. It's the same movie, with a happy ending."
2,Trivialization of U.S. History,Mel Gibson is a great actor. This film unfortunately inserts him into an cheapened cornification of the events surrounding the U.S. Revolution. Heartstrings are tugged and formula spills over into annoying puddles of sentimentality.
2,ROLAND EMMERICH...,"OK, i do not understand THE PATRIOT,a pale copy of BRAVEHEART and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS. So i advise you to buy theses two last one rather than THE PATRIOT. Because BRAVEHEART and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS are TWO MASTERPIECES, and by copying them, THE PATRIOT just wanted to becomes one, but roland emmerich did not succeed, sorry roland, we know the originals."
1,Self-indulgent !,"I am in agreement with the vast majority of the UK in saying this movie provides about as much entertainment as a mild case of influenza. Predictable throughout, unimaginatively directed by the same guy who did the abominable 'Godzilla'. Mel - what were you thinking? Avoid this one unless you like slipping your brain into neutral - may cure insomnia!"
1,I Wish I Could Give This a 0,"Anyone who thinks that this movie has any basis in fact or any remnants of reality should read a few books. I recommend ""The Birth of Whiteness- Race and the Emergence of US Cinema"" by Daniel Bernardi for starters. Films like these only promote a blind ignorance of American history, one which contributes to the racism, bigotry, and nationalist superiority sentiments which are at the root of all our domestic and international troubles. This movie attempts to be a feel good film for anyone who has ever felt disenfranchised because of their race or economic status. If you fell for it, that's too bad."
4,A SOUTHERN VICTORY,"It is a shame that Americans are taught that the American War for Independence was fought only in the northern part of the country. It is even sadder that Americans believe that the war was WON in the north. Thank you, Mel Gibson, for educating the United States of America and the world. Independence was fought for and won in the Southern Colonies. The outstanding point of this movie is that it is about the forgotten war of the Revolution that made this country's independence possible. The movie makes me proud to whistle Dixie."
4,Good Movie,"I liked the movie very much and thought the acting was very good by all involved. Of course, Mel Gibson is strikingly handsome and the hero of the film. It shows what people has to go through back in those times. I highly recommend this film for the whole family."
5,good movie,i thought this movie was great! I saw it twice and loved it each time! But the movie was kinda bloody so if u don't like that kinda stuff you might not wanna see it! I think Mel did a great acting in this movie! I think it is great and recomend you go see it!
3,Oh give me a break,This film has so much sap in it I could pour it over my hotcakes. Mel Gibson was ridiculous in this.
1,Contrived Plot; Soap Opera Movie,"The plot has all the depth of a college freshman's fantasy. The film production is soap opera melodrama at its worst.One example among hundreds: The patriot's son's wife (and everyone else in the village) has been burned to death in the church by the super-evil British officer. So by this time it is all too obvious that the plot can now dispose of the son too. And sure enough, even though the son has shot this super-villain at point blank range with a rifle, the guy is not only not dead but not even wounded (just like in the horror movies). And Mr. Evil rolls over and shoots the son who dies making closeup grimaces into the camera.It is a poor highly over-contrived story plot. And it is poor film making. It is not worth wasting your money on it."
3,Braveheart in Red White & Blue,"Wonderful historical extravaganza with a major drawback. If you saw and loved (as I did), Braveheart, you've already seen this one. Once again, Gibson, this time as The Ghost, instills fear in the hearts of the enemy with his raggedy band of volunteers. Predictably, his loved ones are killed by the enemies of freedom. And Gibson gets his revenge. Some tender moments and terriffic acting keep this Braveheart remake moving but the similarities of the films are just too much to overlook. (If you didn't see Braveheart, you'll probably love it.) Sorry Mel."
4,Patriot,"Ir has been a while since taking American History, but if I was a teacher, I would show this movie as an example what a significant part the Militia played in our history."
5,"War is not pretty, but this film was Grand",While it is a little graphic (scenes of head and leg being blown off by cannon balls - this was a war you know) It is beautifully filmed and edited. I love the way it sounded on my home theater surround sound. I let my 10 year old son watch it with me. I thought it accurately portrayed the real cost of freedom and war. Well made and highly recommended.
1,NOW ......WAS IT REALLY NEEDED???,"With just 11 minutes of unseen footage, the film makers found an excuse to cash in with an ""extended edition"" of the film. I'm absolutely losing count of the number of films being re-released as extended editions.At least in this case, i see no reason to upgrade."
1,Bad History,"A hilariously bad film, very loosely based on the experiences of Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox. The film wishes to avoid the obvious hypocrisy of slaveholders fighting for (their own) liberty, so planter Marion here becomes farmer Gibson, who has freed his slaves. At the time, the colony of South Carolina was sixty percent black, but here the region is virtually all white, with the exception of a single slave who fights in the state militia in exchange for his freedom. (In reality, the SC Assembly banned free blacks or slaves from serving in the state militia.) Following the burning of his plantation, Gibson then arrives at the plantation of his sister-in-law; she too has freed her slaves. Evidently they are the only two whites in SC to do so. The screenwriter, who wrote Saving Private Ryan, knows better. In fact, this film is so inaccurate that one might fairly regard it as racist."
4,Good movie,"This was an overall good movie, but not the best. I thought the storyline seemed to take some expectred turns and frankly I wasn't surprised by the outcomes of some of the battles. If you want a movie with surprising twists and turns this isn't the movie for you, for everyone else, this is a good movie to see."
2,God bless america my arse british arse!!!!,"What a surprise another hollywood film where the USA is a poor defencless country and the Brits ,Japanesse or the Germans are demonised. In this films case its the brits turn to be baby killers.Sure the film is patriotic but sure its just an excuse for the US to win another battle, no wonder the US goverment is so arogant its because films like this come on the scene. The US aint invinsible and its about time they realised it. Anyway the films alright fairly violent the only reason i gave it a 2 is because MEL Gibson and John Issac give a very good performance."
4,Above average content and excellent DVD technicalities,The story and acting is above average.The DVD production is as follows: 1) video: above average 2) audio: excellentThe scene where the fighting was nearing their property produces a pretty accurate sound map. The sources of the artillery firing was accurately positioned and you can actually tell which direction the distant rumbles were coming from. That sort of heightens the tension and realism of the situation.
1,boo! boo! hiss! boo!,"I am a mel gibson fan. Have been one since mad max days. As you can tell by my stilted language, it has had a profound effect on me. Let me give you a quick story. Man is asked to fight the british (who are ruthless). Man says, no, wants to farm, and raise his family. British kill member of his family. Man kills lots of british. Man forms group of inspired fighters, and without any real support, wage battle against the ""ruthless"" british, beating the heck out of them. Now, tell me, was this ""Braveheart"", or ""Patriot?"" Kinda hard to tell, ain't it? Look, also, for similarities between Frances Marion, the Swamp Fox, and Benjamin Martin (last name, headquarters, state militia, left behind to harass the british, etc.) If you want a better movie, same story, get Braveheart. If you do get this one, then use it to throw at the British the next time they are picked as mel's mortal enemy."
1,What were they fighting about?,"Can't recommend this movie. They never make it clear what the fighting is about. The director never really figures out whether he is making an action movie or a chick flick. So he tries to do both and does neither well.The first 45 minutes or so are at least somewhat interesting. But after that the fun is over. The British are portrayed as caricatures. The reasons for fighting are never really explained, beyond the fact that one British officer is a mean, nasty fellow.The best line in the movie, where Gibson states that he sees no reason to prefer 3000 tyrants one mile away to one tyrant 3000 miles away is wonderful. But I am sure the point is lost on 99% of the audience.Yes, some suggest that we have to ignore the historical failures of this film. Fine. But simply as a film this movie was not very good. Rather typical of all Roland Emmerich films. BAD"
1,As the world turns - plus violence-no stars,Finally borrowed this from the library. Wandered off after about 8 minutes-what execrable writing. Screen writers should really give viewers more credit for intelligence. Pity the poor actors whose names and careers have to be associated with this drivel. No stars from me.
1,Weak,This was a weak movie for the fact I found the acting very wooden and Mel Gibson let me down after scaling the heights with Braveheart.
2,Good Movie,"This item was ordered used. It had writing on the box in marker. I was not pleased with that. I almost returned it, but the movie quality was very good. Thank You!"
4,Patriotic Americans,While the movie of course was a hollywood creation it was never the less pretty historically factual. It depicted accurately the horrors and hardships the Carolinians suffered in order to achieve America's independence. My great grandfather was one of them.
5,COULDN'T STOP WATCHING IT!,"This movie was awesome! With HEATH LEDGER-Oh my GOD! I loved him in this movie. I will have to say that it was a little gory with alot of blood, but very much worth it. You guys should definetley get this movie-it's awesome!!!!!"
4,Mel Gibson vs. the British...again,"What did the British ever do to Mel Gibson? This film may be a rehash of ""Braveheart"", but there is one important difference...this one is entertaining. Enjoy it as an exciting adventure film with a good cast and some great action scenes, but be forewarned: if you have strong feelings about the misrepresentation of historical fact, you will not like this film. It is definitely ""History for Dummies"", with black hats on one side and white hats on the other."
3,OK but.......,Great depiction of time and place with good acting but a bit cliche ridden. First could anybody ever have been as evil as the British officer portrayed in this film? Even Hitler? Second if I ever have to see the climactic hero versus villain fight scene where the hero appears to be beaten but somehow pulls it out in the end and kills the bad guy again I may lose my cookies.
2,Blehhhh.....,"Well, I suppose I should be happy that any major studio is daring to touch American history as a subject again; in that way I did actually look forward to seeing this film.The rumors are mostly true: it is in essence Braveheart transplanted to the American revolution. The English are still either effeminate fops or sadistic monsters, and the sole French character is also as stereotypical as ever (but in a slightly humorous way). The entire issue of slavery has been evaded, tearing gigantic holes into the plot. I shudder to think of this movie being used as history education---as much as I thank its creators for taking up this perenially neglected era.Despite all this, The Patriot is still significantly better than, say, Mission Impossible 2. I was curious enough to see it through to the finish (although I fast-forwarded liberally)."
4,Very good entertainer,"Brought tears to my really. It shows a different side of the war, that we didn't know. We never trough in the war as something really violent as the movie showed us. Realistic really. Mel Gibson was great, in fact, all the actors were great. The movie rocks! Too bad that they showed us the British as a very violent and cold-blooded people and the Americans as big hero's, honest and kind people. That was unnecessary and unrealistic. Buy it. You won't regret it."
4,Really Good but not Amazing Movie,The simalarities with brave heart are going to be drawn no matter what. However even with those comparisons it is a very good and entertaining movie. Mel Gibson shows the great passion that has made him the actor he is today. This movie is one that I would and do plan on buying.
3,What happened to historical accuracy?,"Visually impressive but Gibson reprises his sensitive hero shtick. In the movie the British kill injured American troops, Gibson offers to free the slaves if they will fight forthe Revolution and the British burn civilians in a church. HOWEVER, in reality the only documented massacre of injured soldiers was BY the rebels OF loyalist troops, the British offered to free the slaves, a move received with outrage among the slave owning rebels (including Washington and Jefferson)and the burning of civilians in a church by British troops never took place (although the Germans did do this in France during the Second World War)."
2,Absolutely horific,"This was a film worthy to be on on a saturday night at 11pm! . The plot relies on history which obviously the director decided to ignor and they managed to insult almost every English person in the world , depicting them as cold blooded killers . The main character (Mel G) managed to defeat the British army on several occasions seemingly with little effort . The final fight , showed the poor American Colonial militia out numbered by the british but yet they managed to hack there way through 3 battalions of Red Coats ! , an astonishing victory for the people who had been losing the war untill (Mel) joined in . Unless you are a patriotic American you wil not find this film any good , if your British like me then you will probably find it either laughable or insulting ."
5,GREAT BLU-RAY MOVIE,The Patriot is another reson why one should buy a high definition BLU-RAY player. Patriot is exclusive to BLU-RAY and it displays magnificent picture and uncompressed surround sound-GREAT picture and Sound.The Patriot is a vastly entertaining and moving film that gives a glimpse of our fight for freedom from England. The performances are excellent and so is John Williams stirring musicaql score. Get this one-if you have a HD TV I highly suggest you buy a BLU-RAY player-they have an offer now with 5 free BLU-RAY movies-Check out BLU-RAY Players!!
5,A FINE NEW CUT!,"As everyone can guess, most of the extra footage incorporated into ""The Patriot"" is not new, having been on the original DVD release as special features. However, there is some very fascinating new footage during the first half an hour that gives us more insight into the Martin family. But overall, the film is neither better nor worse. The new scenes don't add much to the actual film, but it doesn't take away FROM the film either.The extras on the DVD are the same as on both the Special Edition and the Superbit DVD editions, but the film is given picture and sound that's even more dynamic than on the original DVD's.Overall, I would recommend this DVD to those who don't own the movie yet. For the others, I recommend they find a place to rent it before making a final decision. But it's still a great new DVD edition of a fantastic film.Movie Grade: A+DVD Grade: B+Overall Grade: A-"
4,Wonderful historical film,"Mel Gibson does a nice job as a man amidst the Revolutionary War. Overall, great attention has been paid to historical detail, such as Heath Ledger's character being sewn up in a 'coccoon' - this was done back then when a young man stayed at someone else's house to make sure he didn't do hanky-panky with the young women in the house - I laughed at this and thought it was great, it showed that research had been done. The story itself is riveting with quite a few emotional scenes and some sadness, so be ready to have your heartstrings tugged at. The camerawork and action scenes are also nicely executed, so two thumbs up!"
3,Could have been better,"I purchased this movie because I am a fan of epic-saga movies, I like Mel Gibson as an actor, and am interested in the War of Independence. If you don't share the same interests as me I couldn't recommend that you buy this movie. The effects were excellent insofar as the cannonblasts, and the story was able to hold me. The acting was a bit below the standard for an epic, but not as bad as some out there. All in all, this makes for a good friday night on the couch movie.If you liked Braveheart then I think you should make this movie a part of your collection...if you didn't, then you shouldn't."
3,"DVD quality great, movie mediocre.","There are about four very fine scenes in this movie, but I'm not sure it's worth sitting through the whole film to see them. The revenge plot is insubstantial at best. As for historical accuracy, the real shocker is that advisors from the Smithsonian helped, and still it's full of errors. So much money was spent on this thing, why not earnestly try for some realism other than in costumes? It's a strange world we live in."
4,A movie driven by passion .,"This is a terrific movie that captivates with the energy and drive portrayed by the characters - a rare movie that links experiences with personality and passion. It is a movie which does not reveal all but gradually as you begin to understand the characters and their history the truth begins to unravel. Highly nerve wracking, gory but very moving and dramatic."
3,Braveheart in America,"Although a fair film on its own, if you've seen ""Braveheart"" I recommend staying away from this one, its basically the same without the bite of seeing something original..."
5,Awesome,I remember seeing this in theaters when I was a kid. Loved Mel Gibson's acting in this flick. Could watch it whenever.
4,great performance,"seeing them perform this album live defintly gives you more insight on the story rather than just hearing it, the sound quality and picture are superb. and the costume and props totaly made this one of the best performances ever. making it worth the money to buy this on blue ray over dvd."
1,"If you truly care about live performances, this is not for you.","When i buy DVD's i mainly care about the performance of the musicians, i care about watching them play the guitars, the drums, etc. I just hate this DVD because everything is focused around Tate's cheesy acting. I couldn't really enjoy the concert cause i felt very annoyed about watching him, like i really couldn't stare at him.So yeah, if you care more about the performance, this Blu Ray is not worth the money."
4,"Farflung - 'So Many Minds,So Little Time' (Cleopatra)","I had recieved this CD by total surprise,as I've heard of Farflung before.I've apparently met a member of the band before as well.Turns out that guitarist Tommy Grenas had been out on tour with Nik Turner before.My guess is that Grenas had probably picked up a few tricks along the way.'So Many...' is a way-out-there sounding compilation CD.I am VERY impressed with what it has to offer.I remember hearing ""Vision Of Infinity"" on some Cleopatra label various artists disc.My other favorites are ""Landing On Cydonia"",the Can cover of ""Future Days"",the ass-kicking ""Mother Orbis"" and ""The Way The Sky Is"".Top grade modern day space rock/industrial release."
4,Lebanese pop music with spice,"Catchy tunes and infectious rhythms combined with an interesting voice. The sleeve notes give the lyrics in Arabic and English. The lyrics are more reflective than is usual in this genre, perhaps they give a hint of her personal experiences. My favourite track is Byehku 'Annak which has an exotic sound combined with a driving rhythm."
5,Truth or Fiction? Who Cares!!,"Fact? Fiction? Real author or pen name? Rampa Cult Alert?? What else matters but the CONTENT and how well it was written. A few reviewers on this site are so enamored with discrediting the author, they never once mention the VALUE of the writing. Relax! Lay down your arms. Go ask doc for a calm-downer perscription. Then go back and read the STORY this time, OK?I read the whole series of books 30 years ago and even today, clearly remember the impact they had on me. I never really knew - or cared - if it was all fact or fiction. The Rampa tales are among the most compelling and memorable books I, and millions of others, have ever read.So there!"
4,"Unforgettable and exotic, but a hoax?","I read this book (probably my first about Tibet) back in the early seventies while under the influence of the Rocky Mountains. It was my passport to an unforgettable world. The exotic images influenced me to the point of naming all my cats with Tibetan names! The image of the little boy leaving his home at the age of seven traveling to the monastery alone was very powerful. With the current fascination of Tibet and the Dalai Lama, especially, by Hollywood, decided to give this book another reading. My original copy deeply buried in storage, I was very glad to find a copy here at Amazon and am enjoying it almost as much as the first time. However, I am disturbed by the claims of a hoax. A British plumber? Where does this come from?"
2,Rampapapa,"I was introduced to Rampa at an early age and have read most of his books. As a teen, I found them fascinating. The Third Eye was the better of the lot.Now, I find Rampa difficult to believe. His writing style is overly simplistic and does not evoke the spiritual in me.Can you believe his books were once banned in Great Britain?If you are interested in astral travel, I would suggest you check out Robert Bruce and J. H. Brennan."
1,Nonsense,This book has about as much to do with Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism as any book you might pick up on flying saucers. Read it if you want but don't kid yourself into thinking there is one truth in it.
2,enjoyable read..but not much enlightenment here,"After reading this and as I recall, 2 or 3 other books by Rampa in the mid 70's I was left with an indelible impression of a whining would-be guru, blaming people for not believing him. Even at the time in my callow youth, I couldn't help but think that such behavior was profoundly inconsistent with even a minimal evolution of consciousness, and this guy was supposed to be a master! In my opinion, truly enlightened people don't blame, and they certainly don't whine: Rampa totally blew his credibility (with me at least) when he did that. The story's entertaining though, and I liked it. It is even has mild historical and perhaps even spiritual interest but overall, the work is just light entertainment. As such, it certainly is not significant enough to even merit a debate as to whether or not the author, and the story, were fake or real."
3,Plumber in Tibet,It is well known that this book was written by some one who never went to Tibet. Still makes good reading though!There definately is a pre-ocupation in the West with Eastern mysticsm.
2,"Fun escapism, but little else","I read this book first when I was in my late teens, and I thought it was lots of fun. At no point could I take it seriously though, but it was almost as enjoyable as an Indiana Jones movie. The bottom-line is: Read it as an adventure novel, and it is fun. If, on the other hand, you are tempted to take it seriously, you might like to start devoting some time and effort to developing your critical thinking."
3,Good Read....But No Real Insight,"This book gives you a history channel like walk through on the Tibetan way of life and their goal to achieve oneness. Page after page, is nothing but some guy rambling on about how hard life was for him as an intiate, and the experiences he's had. There is nothing to learn from this book. However if you are a person (like me) that loves to read, then this book is worth the five hours."
4,A charming nostalgic 1970's Fellini Film,"Fellini's film 'Amarcord' catches glimpses of the directors' genius in a series of events tied together in poetic fashion. The Film has enough cinematic gestures and symbols to keep film students busy for years. The charm of this film, although it excells in so many ways, falls short of making it as profound as some of Fellini's films of the 60's. It did not have the same astounding feel of La Dolce Vita or 8 and a half.The style of the film, however, is flawless and the cinematography by Rotunno is beautiful. I am sure many people will like this movie and rate it as a masterpiece - it just did not give the 5 star punch I so wanted to get from it."
5,I Remember Amarcord,Fellini's homage to his family and the town he grew up in never looked better than in this Criterion Blu-Ray edition.As charming and bittersweet as it ever was! Not to be missed!
4,Brilliant in Places,"This is not a coherent or particularly complex portrait of fascism, as some would have you believe. It's a collection of childhood memories that TOUCH on and occasionally illustrate aspects of fascism.It's a clever idea for a movie; others had made similar films, but this one takes it ""all the way"" into being a disconnected series of memories, dream-like. Woody Allen's ""Radio Days"" and Spike Lee's ""Crooklyn"" would be two later films, both quite good, that follow a similar path.In places, the film is absolutely brilliant. For me, the series of scenes that show the boys jerking around in school and wasting their days are extremely briliant, subtle, and effective."
5,My All Time Favourite. A Fellini's Masterpiece.,"I suspect this is one of those love or hate movies depending on whether or not it strikes an emotional cord within the viewer. To those used to such absolutes as plot and action it will be a bust. To those who love the David Lean directorial approach of each scene being a visual image that could stand alone, then this is a treat. I believe the title is Italian for I remember, and this is what the movie is. Fellini's reminscences of growing up in pre-war Italy. They are presented as a series of linked vignettes populated with an extravagant and eccentric collection of characters. Wonderfully evocative, lewd and bawdy, funny and sad, it's a languid walk through one man's memories. I don't collect movies but this is one I own and love to dip into once in a while. It's a treasure to be savoured when the world gets too heavy and we begin to take ourselves too seriously. I love it."
2,The Great Sea of Retarded Sexuality...What a Snoozefest.,"Viewed: 4/12Rate: 44/12: So, let me get this straight: Amarcord is basically about the woman with large breasts? Is that all there is about the film? As the meaning of the title Amarcord means, ""I Remember,"" Fellini forgot to add a couple of words at the end: ""How Bad The Movie Was."" Although the film has many unusual, appealing shots, it is still stuck on glorification of retarded sexuality, overdone nationalism, and abundant release of corny feelings. Here lie scenes: one after another consistently...all random...all have nothing to do with anything else, I was bored to tears. I paused the movie one too many times and couldn't believe that not much of time had passed by. All in all, Amarcord is a waste of great shots. Boy, these women are ugly as sins."
3,ejem...,"im sorry, but i disagree a little with everyone out there. i mean, i recognize some merits in this film, the structure is splendid, its a film bout the town as a character rather than a person or gruop. but theres something about it i dont like. its really naive (too naive sometimes) and really pretty. Antonioni once said that every good story is about something ""bad"", sufferting or something like that. Amarcord is about people being happy for two hours. and when theyre not, everything is filmed in a happy manner. sorry, but i cant like this film (altough the scene of the family at lunch is superb)"
1,WAY overrated,"Too many fart jokes, too many urination references and just an overall bore. I love all the other Fellinni movies I have seen, but this one just was not up to his others at all. Skip this if you can..."
1,Doesn't Withstand the Test of Time,"What may have passed for great art in the narcissistic seventies must today be seen for crude, overbaked claptrap by a once-great cinematist who was just treading water by 1973.I took this dvd out because some reviewers somewhere wrote that it was better than ""La Dolce Vita"". It is far worse, in truth, despite being in color while only black and white film was available in 1950's Italy.I also listened to the ""learned"" commentary on the Critereon Collection dvd, trying to derive some meaning from the disjointed and often offensive scenes I was viewing (movie is obsessed with backsides and flatulence). Whatever those guys were seeing, it was in their own minds, not on the screen. I suspect they had no more idea than I what Fellini was trying to say with this mess, but to admit it would never do for professors of film studies. So they pontificated about feminism and the role of women for two hours--topics in which Fellini was not at all interested!"
4,TITLE ?,"Why do I like this movie, in 1000 words or less without sounding pretentious? Bicycle seats, Mussolini's floral bust conducting an imaginary wedding ceremony, Uncle Tio in the tree screaming,""I need a woman"", the preist and the young boy philosophizin' about masterbation, etc., etc. I swear, buy this movie which is much better than Roma or Satyricon or hell even La Dolce Vita for that matter and you won't be disappointed, and after you've enjoyed this fine, fine, film you might as well enjoy The City of Women."
4,Watch it and learn!,"On the surface, a very messy and vulgar film with no apparent narrative. Watch it more closely and you will see that Fellini is attempting to make a very good point about the oppressive years of fascism. Many think it is an autobiographical film, but Fellini himself denies this fact, stressing how the name Amarcord is the name of a local aperitif. The sexual repression of the young boys, the constantly foggy surroundings, Titta's suffocation by the buxom tobacconist lady - all trying to say something, don't you think? Please don't be put off at face-value, because much more lies under the surface. Enjoy."
5,Gorgeous edition,"Fellini's Amarcord always ranks among the best 100 films in any critic's list, and rightfully. It is middle of the way between his realistic films and his most symbolic ones, that is why I think it can be available for all audiences. It's a beautiful color film.The most important thing to say about Amarcord is that it is funny, in a mild way, not critical, not hateful, just detached.It's characters are re-created after Fellini's cartoons, or stereotypes (some based on real characters in Rimini), some comlpetely imaginary, all most funny and entertaining.Exceptional package by Criterion.Recommended as an exceptional example of the best European cinema."
2,Lousy as usual for Fellini,"There are some funny moments here, particularly with the dysfunctional family around a dinner table, but aside from that, this movie is awful, a bore, stupid, moronic, like most of Fellini's work."
4,Michael Feldman,"Always treating his subject with humor and a bit of disrespect, Feldman tackles trivia and oddities found on the roadsides of Wisconsin. An excellent book to keep in the glove box when you're traveling around the state, or to keep in the house for fun reading any time."
2,An unfriendly collaboration,"I am a huge fun of Tabea Zimmerman's playing, but I could not believe how much I didn't enjoy this recording. Her pianist seemed to have very fixed ideas about the work, and he didn't give Zimmerman any flexibility. Ensemble and phrasing were a problem throughout. This recording did nothing to draw me away from my favorite recording with Michael Tree and Richard Goode (Nonesuch)."
2,The smell is terrible,"We purchased two of these, one for the family room TV entertainment center, and the other for my desktop computer. Both of them are emitting a very strong electrical/burning smell. It has been two days, and so far the smell is just as strong. If you buy this item, keep everything because you may need to return it. We are giving this about two more days, and then they are going back. I will revisit this review. May 16, 2008: It has now been more than four days now, and the smell persists in both units. We called the company, and they said that they had not had this complaint but that we should return the units, which we are doing today."
1,battery cannot be replaced without an extra long screwdriver,No philips screwdriver in my large collection could reach the screws to open the case.Just junked the unit.
3,Works well while it lasts,"This worked for about 18 months before the battery died without warning. I was using this in my home office and I'd come home with the UPS fully powered off. I have other UPS which didn't seem to have this issue. I finally noticed it die when I was in my office; no surge/drop in the rest of the house, but the UPS would just power off.I think the best warning sign is if the battery charge display shows 3 of 5 bars. The battery is dead or almost dead. It's also not as simple to change batteries as APC or CyberPower."
2,"bought it for my aunt, she didn't like it much","My aunt wanted Vanilla scented lotion to please her boyfriend, but he didn't like this one. Happy Birthday, dumpster diver."
1,Not A Sensible Choice,"Fans of the Captain beware. Although this album's title suggests these are original recordings, most of them are from live performances. If you're looking for the brilliant and hilarious original studio versions of songs like ""Glad It's All Over,"" ""Smash It Up Part IV,"" and ""Happy Talk,"" this is not the album to buy. Cleopatra Records ought to be ashamed of itself for such blatant false advertising."
2,"Oh well, at least Captain got some cash for it...","It's a truly unfortunate state of affairs when this is the best collection of Captain's early work on CD.Since I'm not too big a fan of the newer stuff, I bought this for the old stuff and was left wanting for it. The sound quality is awful and the songs mostly unrecognizable. At this point I'm about ready to buy a CD-Recorder and a turntable so I can put my old Captain vinyl on CD-R.Too bad too, as this way, no one really comes out happy..."
5,I said 'Captain....',"'He said, 'wot?'We heard this song in Amsterdam played over a channel selection guide on TV and it literally took me years to track it down. Yes, the rest of the album is bizarre, but this song was in my head for so long. I'm thrilled/relieved/deliriously happy to finally have it on disc to play endlessly. And relive Amsterdam."
2,No purge valve,"For the price, should have included a purge valve. Mouth piece not very comfortable. Poor design."
4,"incredible story, average writing","It is an incredible story and is well told. However, this writer for Business Week over-doses on obscure vocabulary words. While my vocabulary is strong, I had to read it with my dictionary by my side, and for zero added benefit to the story. I would have given the book five stars if it wasn't for these interruptions. There is a time and place for pedantic language, not here.Having an commercial real estate appraisal background, I wish the book would have provided a proper presentation of the project, its cost, and its income pro-forma data. Business writers for magazines like Business Week, Time, etc., have a tendency to provide only one-half snippets of financial data, and you're left guessing the other variables. This book suffers in that regard too."
2,A Lesson With Steve Earle,"I've bought and used many video finger picking lessons in country, blues and bluegrass. All have had merit. The lesson in this instance should be save your money. I did not enjoy it, the directions or explanations were non-existent or poorly done. The dialog between Happy Traum and Steve Earle was dull. I will not use this video to learn anything. It will be shelved to gather dust."
3,"Not bad, I never saw the series though","This book contains three short stories that detail the surreptitious invasion of Earth by aliens. The cover declares it to be ""... based on the smash ABC-TV hit"". I happened across it some years ago and recognized the space ship on the front cover as a model flying saucer I'd built some years before. I now have both on display in my library."
4,Bob Keane on Clarinet,"Bob has had an illustrious career!Producer to Richie Valens...First benefactor to the Fifth Dimention,David Gates,Bobby Fuller Four,.......He began his career as a clarinetist.......He's in fine form on this recording!!!!!!This is a quintet recording, check him out with the big band.(I believe he led the Artie Shaw Band for a time.)He is the Founder of the Del-Fi label, which should secure his name in Rock and Roll history..............I attest to this on 4/28/05......SPIKE"
4,THE 4 FRESHMAN,"I think my library contains all of their recordings; vinyl LP, compact discs and DVDs. If you appreciate their vocal and musical talents, add this one to your collection. If you are just starting to collect The Four Freshman, this is a good one to start with for you library. I have been fortunate to sing in a quartet using their style of harmony and their charts. GREAT STUFF !!!"
5,Product reviews you can understand,"If you are looking to purchase model railroad equipment, this is a good resource. The content concentrates on performance reviews of rolling stock and accessories. Many of the articles are in the bylined ""column"" format, that is they are recurring features in the magazine. They cover all gauges. This is not a scenery building, layout design magazine, but if you'd like to know about, for example, the latest DCC equipment and how well it works (or doesn't), this is the magazine for you. I find every issue has something for everyone, whether a beginner or old hand. I am a subscriber."
4,Fantastic!,"Every song has some personal and poignant message for nearly all types of life choices and experiences. The song ""Cherokee"" especially moved me. I enjoy her music more each time I hear it."
5,vampire themes!,"this cd ""VAMPIRE THEMES"" IS TRUELY that and is aBAT the best cd of the 1990's!it's a mandatory compact disc."
2,It was decent ...,"... but I've only listened to it a couple of times in the 4 months I've owned it.It was the 3rd or 4th CD I got that has 'Bela Lugosi's Dead' on it (that starts to get pretty tedious after a while). And none of the other songs really appealed to me.ah well.you win some, you lose some."
4,Wonderful!,"I loved this book, good story line, I loved Brent and Emily. They were good for each other, Brent kept surprising her at every turn. Emily thought him to be a ""greenhorn"", not knowing that he was from Texas. I loved it, it was great."
4,"Treatment of Water, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Disorders in",Effectively written to encourage learning and referencing. Content is accurate and understandable for clinicians and students. This book covers an area of information that is not frequently studied by clinicians in depth. The material is provided through research and experience by the authors. This book is written to be a pocket sized reference for casual and direct reference. Very good effort. I have found it useful as a continual reference for over 10 years.
3,A solid collection of the sweet science's highlights,"This out of print collection of great boxing matches was published in the early 1980s, but that's no barrier to enjoying the historical treasures herein. The obvious great fights are included: Ali/Frazier, Tunney/Dempsey, and so on, but so are many legendary bouts that deserve a new airing. I personally didn't see what was so memorable of Jose Napoles' one-sided mauling of Curtis Cokes in 1969, but it was certainly good to become acquainted with past masters like Benny Leonard, Henry Armstrong, Carmen Basilio and Barney Ross. Great rivalries are also revisited, such as the trio of bouts by Tony Zale and Rocky Graziano.The collection is authored by many different sports writers, some of whom were present at the fights they write about, and is edited by ""The Isaac Asimov of Sports,"" Bernard Sugar. A knockout!"
3,Another Bowie from Pakistan,"This particular knife comes with a wood handle as well as the BONE handle. Who knows what kind of bone, perhaps Camel. The knives are generally finished fairly well but do not come with a serious edge. The entire knife, including the blade is covered with a clear coat of some sort of laquer ( perhaps to prevent rust during transport). This is a hassle to remove but once done, you can polish up the knife quite nicely. The ""leather sheath"" is screaming for better quality materials as usual from Pakistan. All in all, it a good knock around heavy duty first Bowie and will take a lot of abuse. I gave up on sharpening with a stone on these knives but a small file works wonders and will produce an edge sharp enough for most chores. A good knife for the money as these sell from 12.00 to 15.99 depending on the retailer. A great camp knife without the expense. Every knife is different to the degree of finish so expect a wide variation if you purchase 2 or more of the same model."
2,Ok to check out from library,"There are essentially twelve chapters in the book. The first six and the POSIX specification at the end should not have been included, while the rest should have been written more concisely. In other words, the 500-page book could be boiled down to 150 pages worth reading.The book is also showing its age. First, the code style is not up to the final C++ standard (say, using such older header files as <algo.h> and <stddef.h> instead of <algorithm> and <cstddef>), nor up to the standard of moden C++ design (see code examples in ""Accelarated C++,"" ""Modern C++ Design,"" and ""Efficient C++,"" etc.). Second, although the term ""object-oriented"" is part of the book title, the code presented is still a mixed bag of toy C code and C++ classes tied together in long-winded, procedural main() and thread() functions.In spite of the negatives, one may still learn a few tricks by reading chapters 6-12."
2,somewhat useful until a more concise book comes along,"The book is repetitive indeed -- sometimes with paragraphs copied VERBATIM from one chapter to another. The occasional words of wisdom get buried deep in the page fillers. It does get you started on the subject though, albeit slowly."
5,Absolutely the BEST!,"If you're doing Posix threads in OO and in C++, this book covers the intermediate concepts and builds to more advanced issues. Well thought out. Well designed. If you're doing (or going to do) a distributed, multiThreaded applications, you will thank God every day that you found this book before you started. Unless, of course, you wrote another book on Posix threads. I didn't so I did. :)"
3,A somewhat dated introductory level overview,"This book really has two parts, the first 6 chapters is a fairly simplistic overview of multi-threading concepts, the second half is a rather light-weight treatment of design patterns that are useful in implementing the concepts. I gave this a 3 because as an introduction it isn't too bad if you ignore the C++ coding conventions which are somewhat dated. The code samples are also a bit dangerous since some compilers and linkers will get confused by the use of <algo.h> and <algo> in the same compilation unit.If this was 1997 this book would get 4 or 5 stars, although the concepts are good, the code is now a bit archaic making it a three."
2,Disappointing,This book does not deliver what it promises. Very difficult to read. Some useful information is there but that could be accomodated in 20-30 pages tops.
2,A poorly-written book.,"I was really put-off and distracted by the abysmal quality of the writing. The superabundance of grammatical errors suggest that large sections of the book escaped proofreading. There is some useful technical information, including a thorough comparison of thread and IPC APIs for different OS's, for anyone who can tolerate the grating prose."
3,"Great Songs, but remakes","There seems to be a trend lately with all the legendary Country artists recording remakes of their original songs and the labels releasing them as the ""hits"" (Conway Twitty was the first in 1981 and those are still being released over and over, then Merle Haggard in 1995, and the same with those). As in those other cases,these too are all great songs, and very well performed, but I miss that ""sound"" that only comes with the original recordings... I also miss that spread out 1960's stereo effect that was on the originals.This is a good CD, and it is worth the [price], but don't be like me and buy it thinking you have the original Decca releases."
4,bought the second edition which was edited,"Apparently the first reader bought the original version which di have several typos. I noticed the book was under construction so I bought the second version and thought it was great. I didn't find it to be repetitive at all, and thought the ending was a refreshing surprise."
1,get an editor...,"Honestly, I ordered this book because of the title. I should have learned my lesson long ago. The story is predictable, and at times repetitive. What irked me most however, were the numerous typos throughout the book. Spelling errors and a confused third person limited narration, in which the author alternates between the two main characters, and yet at times it seems even she is confused since the wrong name is accidently substituted. Spend your fifteen bucks elsewhere."
4,black and decker complete guide to painting and decorating,this book is written so one can get many interesting ideas and easy to follow instructions. a varity of ideas for everyone pocket book pictures demoastrate beautifully the techniques i really enjoyed this book and recommend it to everyone redecorating thier homes and or giving a room a fresh look
2,not a mask bag,this is not a mask bag. this is a rope bag. no felt on inside to protect the mask......going to ues as rope bag........
3,"A very basic, not that informative read","Good, short read - would have liked more detail on the various types and history but a good read for the money"
4,If you like Slate you will love this,If you read Slate on a daily basis you will have seen some of what is contained in this book but this is still an excellent choice. Great book to take with you when you have just a short time to read because each article is self contained. You will find things you missed and be reminded of the interesting people that you read about in Slate.
1,Only 6 minutes long.,"This video consists of some people telling short, mostly uninteresting stories of their shark encounters. It lasts for about six minutes."
1,6 min I can't get back,"No sharks in 6 min of a video? Well, at least I fast forwarded.OH!! And it dumped a bunch of popup ads on me."
1,a sad waste,"The science is fascinating, but the people are undignified. It's hard to watch. GO GO GO!!! MOVE MOVE MOVE!!! I hate that self-conscious playing to the camera ""reality"" TV crap. It's an embarrassment for all involved. They actually brought an actor on the boat? Yuck.Why not a dignified narration by a serious person?"
3,Enoyable read,"Murder on Cue is the first of the O'Roarke series. It is an easy & enjoyable read, one you can finish in a day's time. Despite the amateurish mystery approach, the blend of interesting characters with their theatrical lines make up for any shortcoming(s) the book may have."
2,DIN? LIN?,"Dr. Tavassoli, unfortunately, employs classification schemes which are not widely used or accepted. Elston and Ellis or Page's upcoming new addition are better choices."
5,Unrelenting Pleasure,"Galuppi is pretty much new to me, as is probably the case with a lot of early music lovers. It didn't surprise me when I read that he learned composition from another presently little-known master, Lotti. Both offer an abundance of melody and invention. Galuppi's music may not often approach profundity, but that's what we've got Bach for! This disc is rewarding and captivating from start to finish, and the expertise of and commitment from all involved is unquestionable. If you are in need of a little catharsis then don't hesitate."
2,I'm Sorry It Was Dull,"Eugene McCarthy and his 1968 campaign were dramatic, fascinating phenomenons. This DVD captures none of that. Plodding, self-indulgent and more focused on McCarthy in retirement, this is a rather depressing affair. Hopefully someone will eventually make a first-rate documentary of the man and his times that will do both justice."
3,Study group material.,"This is one of those books that you have to take your time with. It is of average readability and best suited in my opinion to a study group. The subject matter is interesting but dry, I found it hard to focus after a while. The lessons are applicable and challenging and the premise cannot be denied, we've certainly lost something over the centuries since Christ lived on earth. Getting us Christians back to obedience is noble and certainly needs to be said, hence the book.Although I found this book at times long in getting to the point, one can certainly come away from the reading with a desire for reverence to God. Therefore, I suggest that should you decide to purchase this book, find someone to share it with and take your time, you will then not be disappointed. Even more important, learn to follow the advice and be patient in doing so, for this subject does not come quickly to most of us."
3,Not for Pre-60 single barrel carburetors,"This manual does not cover the early Rochester single barrel carbs on 235 and 216 Chevy inline 6 engines. I suppose I could have figured that out if I check into it more carfully. When I saw ""single barrel"" on the cover I assumed wrongly that it would cover the model B carbs used on Chevies in the 40's and 50's. For what is does cover it apppears very will written but didn't meet my needs."
3,Half the story,The book is descriptive with lots of pictures and diagrams. There is no doubt that after reading it you come away with a lot more knowledge and know how regarding the Rochester carburetors. My disappointment stems from the fact that the 1977 model that I bought the book for comes with an extensive emission pre-computer controls system. In this regard I did not find the book adequate. A Chilton's repair and tune-up guide covered that topic far better. Certainly a terrific reference to have in the workshop.
4,Food for thought,"Personally, I liked Phillips' First edition better. I gave a copy to a close friend decades ago and the seed fell on fertile ground. My friend Don took an early retirement from a job he had come to hate and traveled the world with his wife Virgina for many years. They found the perfect place for themselves in Thailand, where they now live and base their travels from.The book is small but the advice is valuable, if you use it."
2,misleading title,"completely inappropriate title. i was hoping for a practical book that gives techniques and wha to expect, since the author has exoperienced awakening of kundalini , i expected rich descriptions of his experiences. instead his experiences are confined to a few paragraphs. the book heavily quotes others , and it is done professionally , with all references quoted mentioned. if you are looking for a scholarly book , then this would do. but if you are looking for a how to book rich with personal experiences, this isn't a good choice. i am looking for a ""how to"" book written by a snsible author (the author in this book is sensible i must say ...not over the top like some others ...)"
2,eh...,Alma Lynne is a prolific cross stitch author. I have several of her books and leaflets and this just doesn't do anything for me. There's not one I would take the time to make.
1,Another marketing book hiding behind a branding title ..............,"Quote, ""When I was named director of brand management and marketing at Hallmark, I was given two primary objectives: ...."". The author has used ""I was"" twice in the same sentence. That tells me that he is far more important in his own mind than he deserves to be. And that is the way the book reads.This book over-intellectualizes and over-complicates branding. If you are ever tempted to use his consulting services, please just read one of Al Ries' more recent books first. He briefly quotes Al here on page 245, but just in passing to make a point of his own. He complicates, Al simplifies.You might think that, hey, branding and marketing is a complicated business. It has been made complicated to justify big consultancy fees, like just about every other business. But it doesn't have to be."
5,most helpful marketing book I ever read,"Most helpful marketing book I ever read. It had information I never knew I needed in a brief,descriptive format that I put to use while finishing the book. The reference materials were also very helpful."
1,DO NOT BUY,I question the authors authenticity and the survey mech... I do not doubt cosmic consciousness.. as I am one of these evolved humans... bucke writes of... I am however a defender of this experience and doubt that there are still more than a few that are alive today that have truly been transformed... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! it supports mediocraty and delivers a blow of negative credibility to Bucke.I do not doubt that others have this experience.. the volume of which the new reviewer claims is know to me to not be so.. by the nature of my connectedness with the light... even buke himself claims that there are few in the world of his time that have experienced CC... have we evolved much as a global culture in the last 75 yrs... well based on all my research and intuition the answer is NO!!!!!!.... we are becomming further entrenched with maya...however i give you all a key.. one that can lead to the light for the committed.... at the rise.. GAZE!
3,Not enough durability,"After having played around with EXP/composites/LPs, these regular strings feel to wear out just terribly quickly :( After 10 hours of playing I feel like I want to replace them already, tried 2 sets in a row. Probably to get a proper (pleasure/price)*time I need to switch back to more durable strings."
1,these snap on the stand,"I know about expansion and contraction and take good care of my little GS171 YAMAHA flamenco,(well kept humidity level room and away from sunlight too) I have been disappointed with these strings, They must have a very short shelf life compared to other brands. Over a period of three years using at least three three set boxes.. I experienced that every replacement set , one of the low silverplated strings will break /pop/snap on the guitar on it's own just sitting on the stand. I own many acoustics and electrics and playing for decades, no set a strings break this fast. I would not recommend these after having this problem for at least six sets of three packed strings over the past few years."
5,snappy & clear,"D'Addario has always made the best strings, in my humble opinion. The tone is, to quote one of my own songs, ""hard & clear as November sky""."
2,Not for my 95 corolla,"While the item fits it is not a match. The pump had a different electrical connetion then the original one, so i had to use the original pump - and the tubing which came with it was not usable because it was sized for the pump that came with it. So basicly i paid for the container which i has to adjust to fit because it was a little smaller then my original."
1,window still dirty,I was very un-happy with this product after all this time i just found some-one to put it in for me and its the wrong one i open the box and instead of tacoma tank its a corolla tank not what i ordered.wondering if i can exchange it.hope so...
3,It's okay.,"The jewelry is not as attractive and well-made as the photoIt looks cheap., the mounting of the roses are very cheaply done.No, I would not recommend the earrings to a friend.they look cheap, not elegant."
2,NOT THE SAME BARK-KAY JAMS AS ORIGINALLY RECORDED,"I LOVE THE BAR-KAYS.. THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE ALL MY FAVORITE.. WHAT REALLY DISAPOINTED ME WAS THE ALTERATION OF THE SONGS.. THE SONGS WERE GREAT JUST THE WAY THEY WERE PUT OUT IN THE 70'S AND 80'S .. WHY TAMPER WITH THEM? I LOVED THEM EXACTLY THE WAY THEY WERE..I NOW LOOK TO MAKE SURE THEY ARENT ALTERED BEFORE I BUY.. I HAVE TO SELL THAT USED CD.. THEN TRY TO FIND A REAL BAR-KAYS TAPE THAT ISN'T RE RECORDED.. DONT MESS WITH HOLYGHOST OR MOVE YOUR BOGGIE BODY OR BOGGIEBODY LAND.. I HATE THE TAMPERING.. CAMEO ANTHROPOLOGY WAS EXACTLY THE WAY THE SONGS WERE ORGINIAL PUT OUT AND THAT TAPE IS BUMPIN.. SO WAS CONFUNKSHUN.LAKESIDE,SLAVE.. BAR-KAYS DESERVE BETTER."
1,BEWARE!!!,"These are re-recorded versions. I bought this mostly for ""Holy Ghost,"" and the version here does not even come close to the mind=blowing original. It's as if all the life has been sucked out of the groove. I am not familiar enough with the rest of the songs here to know how they compare to the originals, but my overall sense is that this is some ex-band members going through the motions, and with cheaper production values. There is no reason for this to exist."
4,Oral History at Its Best,"Jacquelyn Dowd Hall and the other writers of _Like a Family_ created a tour-de-force study of cotton mill towns in the American South. It is a very rare book that captures such a clear, complex sense of history; Hall balances a careful sense of detail with a sweeping picture of life in the cotton-mill South by using a combination of oral and written sources. This book is perfect for scholars and non-scholars alike, and richly conjures a full picture of this period in American history."
2,I really wanted to like this unit but....,"The good: It plants pretty far into the ear. The plus sides are it's a snug fit (you won't have to worry about it falling out with normal usage), you can hear very well, it's very small and light.The bad: Since it's so small you can lose it very easily. That's no fault of motorola, but something you should be aware of. Now the major bad... this picks up all kinds of background noise, whether it's there or not. If you're in a crowded room then forget it. However even if you're in a quiet room, then there's all kinds of background noise such as buzzing and what not. I'm not sure how the headset is picking up sound and I don't care. It's picking up extra sound, even if it isn't there.This is for you if you don't want to have conversations and are only checking voicemail. Otherwise....."
2,Star Trek it is NOT,"At first glance this looks like a great idea, but the reality is that inserting this device in one's ear reduces the ability to carry on personal conversations when not in use and it also becomes uncomfortable in a vert short time. The incoming call quality is good, but everyone I call comments (complains) that they are unable to hear me or the quality is so bad that I have to call them back after I disable the device and use my handset, which defeats the purpose of this purchase.I do NOT recommend this product, and at the current list price please select another product, you will be happier for it."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"I'm a self employed 55 year old and just received my H9, charged it, and paired it up. This is the 7th or 8th (I've lost count) headset I've bought since becoming obsessed (obviously) with the notion of finding one that works right outdoors. I'm happy to say that I'm over that fantasy.As far as the H9 goes, it is without a doubt, the worst headset I've owned. It's absolutely useless outdoors, even in low wind, unless you just want to irritate whoever you're talking to. When you answer a call there is a 3 or 4 second delay while it connects; another shortfall. If anyone wants to buy this piece of junk, it's fifty bucks plus shipping. On the plus side, it's cute. So what!"
1,Disappointed and left hanging,"The product was identified as in stock from this vendor [Electronics Expo]. After waiting the full delivery time + 1/2 a week, I finally got a response from the Vendor,""Oh yea, by the way, we don't have any and we've cancelled the order - You're refund is on the way"" Makes me wonder how long I'd have to wait for notification if I hadn't kept calling. I'll never buy another thing from them again - their stocking claims can't be trusted."
2,Didn't last long,"Sorry gang, H9 looks great and is very comfortable but it didn't last more than 13 months.According to Motorola they stoped making the unit, I wonder why. It continued blinking after placing the base unit on recharge.They claim the base unit was bad.Don't buy one if you would like it to last past 13 months."
2,Motorla H9 earpeice,The earpeice is very convient and small. It works very well and is very clear. My only issue is that it has a very short talk time charge.I really am not very emperssed for the cost of the product.
2,Think twice before purchasing this item!,"I purchased the Motorola H9 because of it's size and appearance but the large and middle sized ear pieces were too large and the small ear piece was too small which resulted in the device falling out of my ear! It also constantly repeats, ""Command not recognized...."" or it would ask, ""Did you say? then give a name not even close to the name I ask it to call.I'm very frustrated with this device!"
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Had to return this product. I really liked all of the features, and got a great deal on it. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have enough power to be any distance from the cell phone without breaking up."
3,Anti-Social Form and Function,"I was excited when this headset finally hit the market and was eager to ditch my over-the-ear style earpiece. I was impressed with the sound quality and volume levels, but what made this a deal ender was the way it excluded all other sound but the headset's. Wearing this marvel of technology turned music into the days of AM radio with one ear taking in all the sound from the outside world. I could not hold a conversation with any one positioned on the side I was wearing the device. In traffic it would cause me to not recognize the direction from which sounds were coming from. Nice idea, but not safe for what it was intended - hands-free talking while doing things like driving. Additionally, I fly aircraft that require the use of EAR and three-pronged ear plugs and headsets every day, and yet I could not get on with this in-ear device's intrusion into my ear canal. A great design, but in the end I went back to an over ear headset."
3,Gail VanHorn,I really like this earpiece I just wish it had more than a three hour talk time and that is all it will last then it will die on you.
1,wouldn't buy again,"Fast reliable company, but these caramello bars were kinda hard and the caramel didn't string like normal. Seemed like they'd been melted and refrigerated or old or something. They were edible for some, just not great. We did order zero bars and skors at the same time and they were great!"
1,caramello or BUSTED,"Received the package, packed in bubble bags, outside of box is A-1, but every bar was broken and it was a sticky mess, every bar was mush-What a mess-caramello everywhere when you opened the wrapper. I was really upset, one bar after another, anyway I did receive the stuff, thats my review!!!!!"
5,A cute story with spinning shapes babies love!,The book is very easily read. Not many words so pages turn quickly (which my baby likes). Storyline involves reader with interaction of spinning shapes. Teaches shapes and colors.
5,THE BEST OF THEM ALL!!!!!!,BOUGHT THIS MACHINE AROUND LAST JULY AND PUT IT AWAY FOR AN AXMAS GIFT AND HOOKED IT UP ON XMAS DAY IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES.BOY WHAT A DIFFERENCE FROM THOSE RIBBON TYPE... THE FAXES AND COPIES ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND THE PAGES COME OUT IN SECONDS.IT CAN ALSO BE USED AS A LASER PRINTER FOR YOUR COMPUTER.IT HAS BOTH USB AND PARALELL CABLE HOOK UPS!!!!IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY AND AMAZON HAS THE LOWEST PRICE ON IT.THIS IS A GREAT MACHINE FOR A OFFICE OR HOME.ITS A COPIER TOO.IT CAN COPY TEN PAGES AUTOMATICALLY IN ABOUT 20 SECONDS.YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MACHINE!!!!
4,Reflective novel on marriage and freedom,"The book is not for someone looking for a dramatic plot line, but someone interested in human nature and character development I think will find something substantial in ""The Brimming Cup"".""The Brimming Cup"" is a look at marriage and the meaning of marriage and desire.It's also a pleasant view of rural Vermont life around the period of the early 1900s.Dorothy Canfield Fisher has an enjoyable down to earth writing style that is evident in all of her books, as well as a sharp mind for tackling serious intellectual issues of the day.The contemporary issues that the characters struggle with in the book are somewhat outdated but the underlying fundamental human issues are not.I enjoyed the combination of philosophical and moral issues with the characters that seem rather like people you might like to know."
2,Not original recordings - terrible sound quality,"Contains the songs we were looking for, even though there are not the original recordings (which we would greatly preffer)it is O'k; but the recording quality is poor at best, very unpleasant to listen."
2,"It's okay but, it's not great","It's not Ismael Montes singing, that's why this is not the best. Los Angles Negros have had many vocalist thru out all these years. Even at present time. Althought Germain was the one that gave then international fame, he left and Ismael Montes came in the picture in 1974. Ismael has a more natural, and easier to listen to voice. Germain is more theatical. If you listen good you can tell the different and will agree that Ismaels voice is so much better. Just take advantage of the option to listen to the songs when available and you will see for yourself. I bought other option for under three bucks for a double CD, and it is very good. Amazon has a few execellent options."
2,Totally Disappointed!,"I have to say reading this book was disappointing to me. As much as I love true crime stories even over a hundred years old, the story and case around the crime of the century in Post-Civil war New York City with a journalist killed by his lover's husband was so disappointing.The author encloses letters among the main characters involved in this bitter love triangle but without explanation or passion in explaining why we should read about this case.The author also encloses newspaper article accounts from the time period. Again, there is a little explanation. I was truly dumbfounded that I just read the book anyway even though I didn't enjoy it. I felt that Abby Sage's horrible marriage and love affair went totally undefined by the author. There were bits and pieces about her abusive marriage to her husband but I never understood her or her husband or her lover.I just felt that this book could have had so much to offer and fell too short."
4,I Wish I Had it 6 Months Ago,"I wish I had this book 6 months ago before my company blew money on cruddy software. The front end was absolutely horrible, but being an amateur I couldn't place my finger on what it was. My company bought the software and I bought this book. Just simply looking through the book, I now realize just what the problem with the front end was. Every single ""don't"" the book tells you to avoid, the software does! It blew my mind just how bad the software was. Too bad Jeff Johnson didn't do the work on the software :^( Why four stars? Some of the concepts, in my opinion, were a little difficult to work with. He gives wonderful ""don'ts"" for examples, but some of those ""don'ts"" don't seem to always have a solution for a work around. (Especially when dealing with large amounts of information.) Despite the four stars, any person who writes any code should at least look through this book, or steal a friend's."
5,Great combination of theory and application,"As a web designer with no software development experience, I found this book to be very helpful. I would recommend it to all web designers who have ever found themselves struggling with making site navigation and web applications user friendly. I've spent a great deal of time with some of the classics (Edward Tufte's books and Alan Cooper's About Face), but this book offers an ideal combination of theory and examples. Very glad I found it!"
4,Good pratical advice,"Overall I liked this book. It has many practical guidelines, that you can apply immediately. My only problem was there were many trivial bloopers and many bloopers which may not be bloopers. Again and again he refers to his reviews of client software. He rarely refers to his user studies or other research. This makes me question if some of his bloopers are really bloopers or just his opinion."
5,Experienced developer opinion,"I've been a developer over the paste 13 years so I am, as one said, the main target for cryptichism (from the author's point of view) in this book. But I've got to admit it, he is almost always, right. Never, in my life, i've found such an amount of good advices compiled together. If you want to improve usability this is a good choice.Congratulations Mr.Jeff Jonhson! You are one of kind."
1,Too old,"Don't buy this book, it refers to applications written in early '90. Today it is completely a different story."
3,"A Very Good Book, Slightly Flawed","If everybody who creates Web sites took Jeff Johnson's advice in this book, the Web would, for sure, be a better place. My only problem with it is that the advice could be better.I was at the session at the Computer Human Interaction conference in Holland where Jeff Johnson spoke. But another Jeff, Jeff Raskin also spoke and showed how some of Johnson's examples could be improved.Raskin also introduced a book, The Humane Interface, somewhat deeper than this one, that helps you to really understand Web design. I'd reccomend reading and understanding Raskin's book so that you can see the few places where Johnson's ideas don't quite work. Then you can use this book, which is 95% right."
2,Difficult and without solution,"This book make a review about all statistics for undergradute students, but the author haven't a solution book.Many exercises are so difficult, and I feel it so hard."
2,"Um....not what I expected, and to be honest it was not good","After reading these other reviews, I was psyched to get this album and give it a listen. I loved Love Spirals Downwards, and figured it is basically them anyhow so it should rock. Well, from the first song on I forced myself not to turn of the disc player! It is a totally different vibe then LSD, so if you are expecting anything like the other LSD albums it is not. The vocals are similar for the women, but a guy sings now, if you can call it that. It had 1 or 2 songs that were OK at best, but it was not worth the price I payed. I would return it in a heartbeat if I could. This sounds harsh, but so does the album."
2,not real LSD!!!,"Being a fan of Love Spirals Downwards' last few albums, it was very exciting to see that the project was releasing something new. Before I bought the CD, however, I found out that Suzanne Perry was no longer in the band. So without even hearing ""Windblown Kiss,"" I knew that I didn't want to get it. I don't care about musical growth or change -- I want LSD to stay the same always!"
4,Fun memory and strategy game,"My daughter got this game for her fourth birthday and we have been playing it several times since then. You have to memorize where certain symbols are hidden in order to go forward, and how many of the animals are in the hidden pictures. It is pretty straightforward and she picked up the rules really fast. The kids have to realize that they can move around the volcano much faster when they find more of the animals they are looking for, but that it may be wiser to go only one step forward instead of turning an unknown card and risking to go backward (dragon pirate). The materials are really nice: good quality card board for the cards and the board, and wooden dragon figures to move around, so it should be very durable. It's certainly an educational and fun game, and my daughter likes it well enough, but there are other Haba games that she prefers, so I'm giving four starts instead of five."
1,You can buy cheaper and better,"The only good thing about it is that it is a good width. However, competitors often include several connection tubes, this only has one. The manufactured poked 3 large holes in the middle of the edging to keep it rolled up. Through the holes were poked hard plastic rivets which were difficult to remove and which left multiple holes in the edging. The reason those rivets are there brings up the main problem. This NOT-PROFESSIONAL edging is made of very stiff plastic which is very hard to adapt to whatever edging needs you might have. Even getting it to hold a straight line is difficult because it wants to return to the packaging curve. Because the plastic is so hard and unwieldy apparently they just cannot keep it rolled up for shipping with simple ties, and must resort to poking those damaging rivets through the middle. I have purchased edging from multiple sources in the past and this is definitely the worst."
3,"Some decent material, but not as strong as the debut","I had no idea this band was still around until surfing around I found this release in addition to their debut. Having had the debut since it was released back in the 90's and knowing how solid it is, I bought this without having heard a track. I agree with the other reviewer that states the strengths here really lie with vocalist Nikki Lamborn. The material and production actually sound as if this was demoed together over several sessions and possibly years. Nikki's voice is still very much first rate, but the songwriting on many songs is not the caliber of the debut record. Especially frustrating is the songs sung by Catherine ""Been"" Feeney which to me are not very good at all. Maybe the other reviewer is right in stating Nikki might be better off to start over with a new band/songwriter. 3 stars mostly for Nikki's vocal performances."
3,an unusual cross-over,"The story takes place in the days when Silver Surfer was still Galactus' herald. Darkseid amasses a force against Galactus unlike when the latter came to Earth and all there was to fight him were the Fantastic Four. Good premise with the promise of a big showdown between Galactus and Darkseid. Only problem is that the story and characters just seem to go through their paces and the art seems lumbering toward the end. The status quo is changed back to what it was in the beginning. There are a few surprises like Silver Surfer rebelling against Galactus and the New Gods stepping back and hoping that Galactus destroys Darkseid and his world. This book should shine but doesn't but would be a shame to ignore it, either. A must for fans of Jack Kirby's characters."
2,Disappointing,"I had really looked forward to this. When this first came out, Byrne was near the top of his game and he was combining the New Gods with Galactus and the Silver Sufer. Unfortunately, the final product proved to be kind of sloppy. First, the Silver Surfer's entire purpose is to find worlds suitable for Galactus to consume and for some reason he couldn't tell that Apokolips didn't meet the basic criteria. That just sort of ruined the whole thing for me. Second, and less important, is that the Surfer is portrayed as too powerful for Orion to defeat. Based on my familiarity with both characters from years of reading comics, I'd have done it the other way around, with Orion pretty much mopping the floor with the Surfer.Artwork is very good, which sort of makes up for the glaring problem with the story I mentioned above. Worth having on the shelf, if only for Byrne's respectful treatment of Jack Kirby's amazing creations."
5,SPACE THE FINAL FRONTIER.,"The work is wonderful because it uses characters created by the late great Jack ""King"" Kirby. The creations are rendered my the master John Byrne. The work shows how dastardly Darkseid really is and how powerful Galactus is in the universe. Please try to find this book. It incredible."
3,Super High Paramedics !!,"I have to start saying that this is a serious movie involving Paramedics doing drugs while they're working (and of course, in their own time too).It is very disturbing at times and makes you feel sorry and angry for the characters because they are completely out of control and this is a kind of work where the people's lives depend on this two persons...This movie will leave you thinking and will stay with you after its over."
3,Spiraling Straight Into Hell,"This is a indie film about two EMT's. One of the guys is a rookie and all around good guy. The other guy is a veteran and burn out. Basically it's a story about how the veteran EMT corrupts the rookie. Drugs, voilence, more drugs, TONS OF DRUGS. Basically it's a sad story that's hard to watch. No one likes watching crackheads do drugs. The story is kinda weak, but it's still entertaining."
5,The only good music is older music,With the cRAP they try to pass off as music these days Croce's music shines brighter than ever.There will never be song writers and musicians this good again. I suggest anyone who loves reallygood music to collect these gems while they are still around. BTW -This CD seems to be digitally remasteredbecause the audio quality is better than the originals.
5,Greatness,This is absolutely the best collection of Jim Croce's stuff. If you are into any sort of classic rock or just want some music that you can unwind to this is a great collection to get. This collection along with Harry Chapin's Gold Medal Collection are perhaps the greats song compilations ever created. Cant say enough about it. Just buy it and enjoy.
5,One of the best albums you will ever hear. I have listened to this album for more than 30 years and never get tired of it.,I have listened to this album for more than 30 years and never get tired of it. It is amazingly smooth and engaging. Roberta is so easy to listen to.
4,good no frills treadmill,"Does what I need, basic functions, speed and incline controls and timer/speed displays are all set up well. Noise level is low allowing me to listen to the TV or radio easily.2 Negatives - I don't like what are supposed to be cup holder/remote control bins. Very poor design. I tie-wrapped an improvised remote control container to the handle. Static shocks have been frequent. Is there a good way to preclude this such as a specific grounding technique?Overall very satisfied."
4,"Good, basic euipment",There are other treadmills out there with a lot of extra features that are nice but they are also massive. The TR 2000-HRC does everything you need quietly and with a minimum footprint. I love that the motor box is not in front as I alway bumped into that with my last machine. I wish it had an MP3 jack but I am thrilled with the choice of this machine. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of an MP3 jack.
3,Goldfish ice bucket by Wild Eye,This is a really cute gift idea and is excellant in quality But be careful to look at the size.......it looks like it's normal size but in reality one beer can will fill this container.
4,One of punk's finest,"Good punk album elevated to great due to the new remixes. Personally, I feel this is right up there with ""Rocket to Russia"", ""Blank Generation"", and ""Talking Heads '77"" as a classic American punk album. There is a certain joy to the rock 'n' roll sounds that are captured on this album, and it is certainly the best post-Dolls Thunders release. I had heard a few of the original mixes, and quite frankly they were below par. The guitars and lyrics sound blurry. Thankfully, someone decided to show us all how it was truly a great album despite it's sound imperfections by remixing it. As the story of the band goes, the album failed to make a good amount of money, and they broke up. I guess the song ""Born to Lose"" is a little prophetic."
1,Drivel,"This book is nothing but a sorry rehash of old newspaper articles about the band. She doesn't interview any of the members & it appears that the closest she could get to DMB was interviews with ""old fans"" who remember them from day in idyllic C-ville. Nothing new here, just a lame attempt to cash in on a ""hot"" band. It's really too bad, because a more in depth book about the band would be right on."
4,It enLIGHTened me,This book gave me a good amount of DMB info. It kept me very interested from beginning to end. I think Morgan Delancey did a wonderful job writing this book and I especially liked the way she told about all of the band members past experiences etc...and how DMB became the phenominal band that they are today!!!
2,Snoozer,"I am a huge DMB fan, but this book bored me to tears. It is full of historical information that may please many fans. I, however, just wanted a little more ""story"" from the reading experience."
2,I spent money on this?,"Okay, I love the DMB. I'm a fan. But this book is so poorly written, that I could barely stand to read it. Sure it has some cool info on the band. But I already knew all that. Sure it has interveiws of people. But not of the band. Wow. She interveiwed Dave Matthews' neighbor. Jeez, that was so interesting. Don't waste your money on this crap. Go surf the Net a bit, and you'll find out a lot more, and it'll be better written. Actually, if you want a copy of the book, I'll sell you mine, real cheap. It's in good condition. I love the DMB, but I do not love some money hungry no talent author scrambling to make a few buck off the band. How uncool is that? The only reason I gave this book any stars at all was because it's about the DMB"
1,Complete and utter claptrap and boring to top it off,"Being the Dave Matthews Band fan I am, I bought this book....that was a huge mistake.....I have never read a more dull, mundane, tedious book about a musician in all my life. Ms. Delancey must have been writing this as her term paper for whatever college that had the misfortune of accepting her. There are no first hand accounts from the band members themselves. All that is here is a basic rehash of some magazine articles and stuff that any average joe who knows how to use a search engine can find...Needless to say...this ""book"" was a complete waste of the paper it was printed on...Trees were cut down for this???? Ms. Delancey, if you read this, do us all a favor and make this your first and last foray into the realm of ""literature""."
5,Better than I expected,"Anyone who likes the Dave Matthews Band is going to like this book. I was impressed with the amount of interviews Delancey had with all the people who knew DMB way back when. You definitely get the feeling this is the real story behind the band, not something pieced together from gossip and hearsay. The photos are excellent."
1,Author's 1st Book?,"This book is an intellectual masterpiece -for a third grader! Where did this guy learn to write? Honestly, I can't believe this Morgan kid actually found a publisher. I read quite a bit in my spare time. I couldn't even stand to finish his book.A friend of mine recommended that I check out The Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People. Reluctantly, I did. It was great!I did some research and found out that Nevin Martell is quite a writer. In fact, he used to work for one of my favorite labels -Atlantic Records. I was especially impressed with his gigographies and list of bootleg recordings. I highly suggest his book, The Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People."
2,Not Bad,"This book lacks any real soul. Sure, it certainly contains a great many words, but there's not a whole lot else to be said for it. If you're new with the Dave Matthews Band, you'll learn some neat things. The writing is neither good nor bad: it is merely there. Still, it has its moments. Alternately, you could read the DMB FAQ."
2,I could have written this book.,"This is a book that quotes every other book written on Dave Mathews Band. There are no original interviews. The author takes from interviews done by other writers and radio stations. The author does a tacky thing when he quotes the band's songs when he is starting sentences. That is really tacky. It also repeats itself and worse of all, it even quotes from some bad reviews the band has had. That is no way to show a band in a possitive light. Find a better book on the band to buy. This is a waste of money."
3,blah,"When I first read this I wasn't too thrilled with it. It reads like an essay, albeit a good essay, but an essay nonetheless. I'm still not impressed with the book, but there is a lot of info in Step Into The Light, if you know where to look. It leaves off before the release of Before These Crowded Streets, so it's not the most up-to-date thing out there. For the DMB newbie, it's a good place to start. And for the diehard Daveheads it's a nice-looking addition to the collection. At least the pictures are good (and some are even in color, oooh)."
2,"Although an informative book, it leaves a whole lot to want.","Even though this book give a rathe comprehensive history of the band, it has to be one of the single worst written books ever written. Instead of getting an interview, the author quotes every other interview ever recorded."
3,"Lots of good information, but just to repetitive","This book is definately a nice addition to any DMB collection, but it just repeats things to many times."
2,She has potential,"This was the best book that I have ever read that was written by a second grade student. Morgan Delancey is well on her way to become an above average english student for the remainder of her time in grammar school. I don't know how she came up with those big words, such as ""wrote"" and ""concert"". I'm looking forward to her next piece of bogus literature because it should be a bit more creative and insightful and maybe, just maybe, it will include an actual interview given by the author."
5,Loved it!,"What a great book. Morgan Delancey's interviews with the people who were there from the start-- including the missing 6th member of DMB, Peter Griesar--really rock. There are at least 30 original interviews here conducted by Delancey--like Griesar's: from people who were there from the start, including Stefan's dad! You can really tell that Delancey traveled to C'ville to write this book. The newer book (from Simon & Schuster) is a ripoff of this one. And I mean, totally. From the language and everything! It's almost word for word this book. Don't be fooled. It costs more. But STEP INTO THE LIGHT is the real deal. And has awesome photos. Plus taper acknowledgements in the end..."
1,"CrashHeads like it, true fans know better","Anyone who had been listening to the Dave matthews Band (or has an appreciation of literature) knows that this book is just plain lousy. The information was trite and repetivtive, not to mention the fact that most of us who know the band knew this anyway. I was looking for interesting interviews or quotes by the band and I found none. NOT EVEN AN INTERVIEW CONDUCTED BY THE AUTHOR! FYI, if you're going to write a book about someone who isn't dead, interview them. It'll be better that way. This book is just plain bad."
3,A couple of kids are kidnapped on a busride home,"Its okay. Not excellent, because the idea isn't original and could have been much more developed. Not much suspense. More of an adventure. But, its still worthy enough to be mentioned. One thumb up."
4,I,I thought the book was pretty good but I agree that the book had a simular plot as many other books I have read. I also have read some other books by Lois Duncan and I enjoyed them but other authors books that I have read have been better. Over all I enjoyed the book and I look forward to any other books Lois Duncan puts on the market.
3,"Good book, but the plot has been used before","I thought that this book was well written, but I wish she had mixed up the plot a little more. I have read a lot of books that have basically the same idea and process of action.Alexa Mossbrook"
5,captivating book - a must read,"The book ransom is a very good book. It has kept me interested through the last word. The moral behind the story was great; the grass is not always greener on the other side. The moral is a common one, but in this story you see it in a different way.The kidnappers plan the whole thing out. They would kidnap the kids that lived in valley gardens, a place thought to be all rich people. The kids are riding the bus home from school unexpectedly as they do every day, then all of the sudden they go past their drop off spot. They go farther and farther until they have no idea where they are.Five kids are kidnapped as each of their families are forced to pay a very large ransom. What the kidnappers don't know is that the ransom is as hard for them to find as it would be for anyone else."
4,Ransom by Lois Duncan,"Ransom By Lois Duncan was a thrilling book full of twists and turns. Different personalities make all the characters unique, along with complex egos. The book was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to people, who like books by Margaret Peterson Haddix."
3,"It's okay, but so many questions left to answer","The first half of this book is excellent. The author sets up the story and shows us real characters, giving us an exciting, suspenseful story. The second half of this book, however, was a let down. Not only does the story rush through to the ending, but the reader is left with many questions. The author suddenly introduces complex characterization of the characters that, while interesting, never get resolved. It is almost as if the author got an idea and then backed off of it or was unsure how to resolve it. The ending is sudden and abrupt and the reader is left hanging. I would have liked to have seen more through the parents' eyes. I would have liked to have read something about the crew say a month after the kidnapping. The idea is there, but the whole story lacked for me."
4,A Good Read,"This is a good book to read. The concept is very original, the plot is good, and the characters are interesting enough for the reader to follow. The only problem I had with this book is how obvious it is that it's set 30 years ago. The girls are expected to be terrified crybabies, and everyone is surprised when one of the female characters stands up for herself. Despite this, ""Ransom"" is definitely a good book to read. Would I buy it? No. But I'd definitely re-read it."
5,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat!,"This book is one you can't put down. It tells the story about 5 kids who get kidnapped right of their school bus, and how their families are struggling to get the money to get their kids back. It also tells the bravery of the kids, and how they try to escape danger. The ending will suprise you the most. The last one who you think can save the 5 kids, does. If you want a book that will keep you in suspense, on the edge of your seat, and one that leaves you with a cliff hanger at the end of every page, this is the book for you."
4,Ransom,"Ransom, by Lois Duncan, is a very good book. It is a realistic fiction book.In Ransom five kids from a rich neighborhood are kidnapped and kept for ransom, but only a few families are able to stretch their money and use it for the ransom. This book is about what the kids, and parents, go through when the kids are kidnapped.Ransom was a very good book and keeps you interested throughout the whole entire book. If you like exciting and exhilarating books you will love this one."
3,"Good, not great...","""Ransom"" is a worthwhile read, but it falls a little short of Ms. Duncan's high standard. If you want a really good kidnapping story, check out ""The Solid Gold Kid"" by Norma Fox Mazer."
4,pretty good,"This book has a lot of cliffhangers. Five kids were kidnapped for ransom. They learn to become friends with each other. They learn things about each other no one else knows. A ""hero"" becomes a not so great character. The wimp is awesome in heart. The strong guy isn't so strong after all. The boring girl falls in love. And the beutiful girl with big beliefs finds out they aren't true. Who is who? You have to read the book to find out."
4,Confusing *^_^,"This is a story about five kids kidnapped for Ransom. Their names are: Mark, Dexter, Jesse, Bruce, and Glenn. I got confused with each persons profile... it's a very exciting book, with adventure and mystery. The parents get involved (at least one of them). If you like mystery, this is a good choice."
2,"Okay, but...","I really liked this book until I got to the end. The ending really put me off! I don't really think there could have been a happy ending in this book, and the one Lois Duncan picked was very unrealistic. If you want realism I suggest you read Robert Cormier's books, he is very realistic."
2,like most people say plot is used to much,I did injoy it but it just got to boring. I'm also a reader of Joan Lowry Nixon and any one who reads this should read one of her books. She never uses the same plot over. Lindsey Mullnis aka Rainbow
1,Ransom,"This is the worst Lois Duncan Book I have ever read! The plot was well, and the characters were secure, but the way she kept the story going as if it didn't even have an end, made me want to stop reading it. I seriously FORCED myself to read this.Lois Duncan is my favorite author, and I have read fantastic books by her such as: Locked In Time, Stranger With My Face, and Down A Dark Hall. If you love reading suspense and thrillers, read these. But if you enjoy being bored and hate having to finish a book because you started it, read this."
3,Awful,This book is about a group of teenagers who get kidnapped on the shcool bus.There taken to a remote cabin in the mountains.The problem is the story drags and the characters are boring.It gets alittle better at the end when the rebel Glenn trys to escape.One of the kidnapper's Bruce goes after him there's a car accident someone's shot yet who? Read The book
4,"I liked it, but it was a little hard to follow.","I think Lois Duncan's books are very good and then is a very good one, but I thought it was a little hard to follow. It would have been better if she used it from one person's view...like Jesse's, Dexter's, Bruce's, Marianne's or Glenn's...even Rita would have been good. It makes the story seem more realistic.."
4,One and a Half thumbs up!,Before I wrote this I read all of the other reviews and as many people have said this plot has been used before. But Lois Duncan has thought it out carefully and it is a good book.
3,It was OK...,"This story was all right, but I found it kind of boring. I've read much better ones by her, in which there are more surprises and mystery."
4,Ransom,"-This will be my secound book of Lois Duncan that I have read. i really like her work. This book, Ransom, could happen anywhere! Thats why I like it so much. It is so true. The people in the book sound like some people I really know. The way the kids are kidnapped is so real that I wouldn't be surprized if it has happened somewhere before. These 5 kids were vey brave. I don't know if I could do the same thing that they did or for that matter HAD to do. I would reconmend this to almost anyone I know."
4,Ransom,"Lois Duncan is well known for her mysterious and suspenseful books. Ransom is not an exception of the great novels written by Lois Duncan. If you have read and enjoyed her other novels, you will like this one as well. This novel is in particular one of my favorites. Duncan allows the reader to read the novel from different views. The novel is written in a way that each character ""says"" what they see. The five protagonists are interesting and high school students will probably relate to one of them in some way. The characters learn more about each other, and realize how they really are. For example, Glenn Kirtland; the popular handsome guy, football captain and president of the student body , turns out to be the most selfish guy anyone would ever imagine. I would recommend this novel to anyone that enjoys suspense, specially teenagers."
4,Ashley's review,"I liked this book because it was an on the edge of your seat kind of book and I love those books.Five children get kidnapped and the people who kidnapped them are calling for ransom! The kids are in high school and are wondering why they were the ones chosen. The parents get a phone call and have to gather $100,000 to pay the ransom or they will never see their son or daughter ever again. They can't call the police or their children will get killed.If you like books that are nail biters then I encourage you to read this book!"
2,barbie corvette,"I don't like fact that the barbie corvette cannot turn while going forward, it can only go straight. Also, it can't even go straight backwards. It only turns one way going in reverse. I wish it had a little more maneuverability."
3,fun but disappointing,"Indeed the car only turns when going in reverse. My 5 yr old daughter badly wanted a radio controlled car, but was insistent that it not be a ""boy"" car. So we got this. Out of the box I was very disappointed and still think its a shame that Mattel feels they can dumb down a girl's car to this extent (the remote only has 2 buttons). That said, my daughter does enjoy driving her dolls around in this and hasn't lost interest in 2 months. She will play with it for 30 minutes a time, once a week."
1,"Don't waste your money!! But hey, atleast its PINK!","The only thing they got right on this product is the color.... My daughter received this as a b-day gift and I tell you that I would return it in a heart beat if I could (no receipt and it's been taken out of the box). The only good thing my daughter said she liked about the car is that it's pink. My daughter just turned 5 and it is way too slow for her, she would rather push it across the room herself than waste her time driving it. The slowness of the car along with the steering problems of the car ... make it impossible to cross a small room in less than 5 minutes. She says it's boring so I give it 1 star for fun!! Educational, definately 1 star because if anything it's confusing having to go in reverse to turn in one direction only. Who knows about durability, it won't be played with that often to even find out! Sorry, thumbs down on this product."
3,Great Car Nice BUT....,"Everything is nice, it is nicely built and durable, and yes the seatbelts work fine, AND the tires are good quality, the the remote has no steering device! What the heck!! How do you steer this car, my kid cant figure it out... what a shame that its deficient in this regard."
1,WHAT JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS TOY. MY DAUGHTER'S HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN. YOU DIDN'T EVEN NEED THE REMOTE TO MAKE IT MOVE. SOMETHING WAS INTERFERING WITH IT. THE LIGHTS WERE ON CONSTANTLY. I ACTUALLY HAD TO TURN IT OFF SO IT WOUDN'T DRIVE ITSELF OFF. THEN WHEN IT WAS ACTING NORMALLY, IT ONLY GOES FORWARD AND BACKWARD.WHAT A JOKE. MY SON HAS R/C S' THAT COST LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE THAT GO IN ALL DIRECTIONS. WHAT, GIRLS DON'T DESERVE TO GET A CAR THAT GOES LEFT AND RIGHT? I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SO UPSET AT A KIDS TOY, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO SEE YOUR KIDS CRY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP A TOY THAT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT, I REALLY GET ANGRY.HEY MATTEL CHARGE US AN EXTRA $10.00- $15.00 FOR A VEHICLE THAT GOES LEFT,RIGHT,FORWARD AND BACKWARDS. I'M SURE A LOT OF PARENTS AGREE, AND WOULD SPEND THE MONEY.HOW ABOUT THAT IDEA FOR 2004 CHRISTMAS???????????????????????????"
1,J.U.N.K.,"I wish I'd have read these reviews before we wasted our money. This thing is junk! It doesn't steer....it claims to turn in reverse, but it doesn't even do that. It takes off going when we're not even touching the remote....just unbelievable. DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,lousy quality - - -,This is the worsed of a quality DVD I've ever received. Just too many distortions and misses within a picture on the screen. Also the DVD was loose in the cartridge and has various of scratch marks. As I've already mentioned it is just a very bad item and it is to me rather amazing how this kind of an item is sent out to a customer - on top of it all it is not a cheap item either. Please let me know where to send this DVD for an exchange or a CREDIT? Please send to me the INFO as quickly as possible as I'm leaving for Europe soon. Thanks.
4,A nice TV,"I like this TV so far. The standard definition programming scales quite nicely and looks a lot better than on some of the other TVs I compared it to. I have only done over-the-air high definition broadcasts, but I can tell you that those look great! With the right settings, our DVDs also come through quite nice and it is just enjoyable to watch.A couple of things I don't like: the built-in speakers generally perform well, but can cause an annoying sound at medium-loud volumes when the deep base vibrates the plastic housing. The other annoying thing is for OTA broadcasts; if you lose a station's signal for very long, the TV erases it from its memory and you have to redo an auto-channel scan to get it back (or know what its true ""channel"" is and not the remapped one).Overall, I would highly recommend this television."
4,"So Far, So Good","I've had this Panasonic for three weeks now and am very pleased. It looks beautiful even when turned off. I'm still waiting to purchase a HDMI DVD player and cable to see how it really works, but I'm happy. If you're going to purchase this TV, make sure the stand comes with, because some online sellers won't tell you the price doesn't include the stand...unless you directly ask.The non-HD channels look kinda bad, as do the DVDs playing on my non-HDMI DVD player. But since this TV has a built-in HD tuner, the HD antenna I purchased makes all HD channels look amazing."
1,Bubbles a bust,"These were not good at all, the bubble dispenser apparatus makes a loud noise which scared my dogs, and there is no discernable bacon scent. If I have a guest with a small child I guess it's something they could play with, otherwise it's a bust."
5,Outstanding work,"Of all the Authors dealing with historical fiction, Avid Williams is my favorite. He has a knack of telling history in a way that actually puts you there. His books are written in such a way that makes learning history both enjoyable and interesting and should be a must read for students of all ages. I have read all his books and they are all 5 star.Outstanding WorkThanks Arvid"
4,The man who couldn't tell a lie book review,"Have you ever done something horrible and had to think of something so the person wouldn't think you were responsible? Well Juan Verdades did.There is a plot on Juan saying that he can't ever tell a llie and this other man and his daughter thinks they can make him tell a lie. Juan is a worker for Don on his ranch. He tends to the cattle and Don's wonderful apple tree. Don is the owner of the ranch that Juan works at. This story is set in mexico how I know that is that they speak spanish. This is a fiction story that has been retold by Joe Hayes. Joe Hayes really used some good descriptive words to get a picture in your mind. I would recommend ths book to young adults and little kids because its a fun book.All in all ""the man who couldn't tell a lie"" was written very well for both young adults and kids in kindergarden threw first grade. The book has a very interesting ending and I think you would enjoy reading it to."
2,Huge Pietasters Fan and Very Disappointed,"I've been a big fan of the Pietasters since middleschool (I'm now a grad student!). This album was a letdown. The reviews before me indicate that it is more ""old school"" than turbo, and they are right, but to a fault. This sounds like it was recorded in a garage, and the band is back to day one without practicing. The horns are flat, there nothing that hooks you in. Pietasters, I'll see you guys whenever you come to Boston, but don't play stuff off this album at the show."
1,ummm.....this pretty much sucked!,"As an avid fan of the cure, I must say that this was an extreme let down. It probably started off as a good idea and then somebody booked the wrong bands to cover these songs. There are some okay moments, albeit fleeting, but generally I was shocked and horrified by the sounds I was being subjected to. It was definitely too good to be true when I found this album for $3 at a used music store. Somebody was smart and got as far away from it as possible. Don't buy this album unless you need a coaster on your coffee table."
1,Terrible,"This an awful attempt by goth and industrial bands (for the most part) to cover the cure. DO NOT waste your money. Look for some obscure bootlegs, but don't plunk down $15 for this!"
1,This doesn't do RS justice.....,"This CD is a major disappointment. It definitely does not do The Cure justice. The only song worth listening to is ""Sinking"" all the other songs are butchered beyond belief."
1,Ohhh the agony,"I'm disappointed to say that this album is awful. I love the Cure, and it's totally sad to see the beautiful masterpiece original songs screwed up and ""modernized"" by today's industrial/goth bands. Plus, the Cure's songs are way awesome in the first place not only because the amazing poetic lyrics, but also due to Robert Smith's unique and groovy voice which further defines the moods of the songs and words. Without his voice the songs seem to be missing their souls. As a Cure fan, I bought this album just to have all the Cure's CDs, but I advise everyone not to waste their money on this and get Standing on a Beach- the Singles, or The Cure's: Galore (both are Cure cd's that anyone will love)."
4,"""gothy"" covers of some classic cure","I admit I wasn't expecting much from this tribute. I bought it mostly out of curiousity. It is actually a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge fan of goth but hearing cure songs covered by some straight-forward goth bands was actually pretty interesting. This album does help prove Robert Smith's contention that the Cure was never a goth band. I've always been drawn to the Cure's darker element, though I do love the ""Kiss me"" album. Most of these songs stay true to the original versions while adding a bit of the cover band's personality. Not as bad as some of these reviews would lead you to believe..."
5,A Necessary set,"I work in industrial settings, and this is one of the few set of drill bits that have used that is long lasting. Most drill bits after a short period of use, are dull. These on the other hand are long-lasting."
2,Milwaukee 48-89-1105 1/16-to-1/2-Inch Titanium-Coated 20-Piece Twist Drill Bit Assortment (Tools & Home Improvement),"Very disappointed with the Milw. Titanium bits. Break easily, don't maintain sharpness. I agree that the case is definately the best thing about the set. I've been picking up various other brands (also in Titanium) to replace the broken or dull ones and they all seem to be equally lousey. Even the big ones are not very good. Biting edges breaks off way too easily. Will be returning to carbide tipped bits."
2,Made in China with Milwaukee name on them,"Sorry to say these bits are poor quality. Very soft inside and bend quite easily. May work for the homeowner, but you get what you pay for. A set of bits sold for profit alone. No shame!"
3,They are ok.,"I'm not sure what the grind angle is on these but they are not what I consider to be a really good drill bit. They do not do very good in wood, a which is what I use them for around the house. I will probably bring them to work and resharpen them on our drill sharpener when I get the chance and check the difference out.Pat"
5,Really nice set for the price!,"I think these drill bits are really worth the price. Nice case also, dropped it several times and haven't had any problems with it opening or with bits coming loose. I have drilled several holes in 1/8 inch steel with the 5/16 bit and it is still running strong unlike a different set of drill bits I paid the same price for. This set is perfect to carry with your portable drill so you have what you need where you need it."
2,Dullsville!,"I didn't expect much with bits at this price, but realized yesterday trying to put a pilot pole in a simple piece of hardwood that these are some of the dullest bits I've encountered in many years of bargain-bin hardware shopping. Shocking to have the Milwaukee name on it... if their Sawzall was of this quality a lot of remodel projects would never get done.On the plus side, the case is solid and easy to open/close and the bits are easy to get in and out. Two stars just for that. I'm going to swap out some of my drill bits from better kits and I think I will be happy."
2,disappointed so far,"My first disappointing experience with these was drilling a door jamb to relocate a striker plate. Needs a little precision, right? Not with these bits, which walk like a dog right out of a punch mark. Second job, pre-drilling nail holes in oak trim, on the bench in my workshop. Simple job, right? Not for these bits, broke one in two pieces with surprisingly little effort. Of course, the other bit in the same size finished without any problems. Both of these things tell me there's a quality control issue. Be warned! It's like putting cheap tires on a Porsche, these bits are the most vital but weakest link."
5,Combo Set,"This is a nice set of bits, which everybody nows Milwaukee is the best in the line of product. The case keeps them strait....Thums up!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not impressed,"After reading all the reviews in favor of this unit, I didn't hesitate to spend the $100 (a lot more than the other options) to buy one. The sound quality was ok, and the portability was great. There is NO bass in the music though, and you typically have to turn the volume up really high to hear it clearly.Now the problems. I ordered it direct from DLO. 2-3 months after I got it, the unit quit broadcasting in stereo, and music would only come out of the left speakers, and sometimes it would just cutoff completely. I contacted DLO about it, and the response was ""tough luck, we only offer a 90 day warranty"". They were really rude about it. $100 and you only get a 90 day warranty??? So now I have a $100 paperweight. BOOOO!"
2,Save you money,I went with this more exspensive product to avoid getting something that would have static. I wasted my money. I live in a small town in SC and I can't find any stations that don't cause interference while driving for more than 5 minutes.
2,DOESN'T FIT ALL IPODS,The unit does not have the right fittings to fit the 30 Gb Ipod 5.5 generation. It fit's in very loosely and the contact is spotty.
2,Maybe I got a lemon,"I was really excited about this product and couldn't wait to install it. Having done so, I don't have a problem with sound quality (except as other reviews have said, higher volume produces distortion) but what is driving me crazy is the automatic turn off feature. Even with the Ipod playing, i.e. it is not on pause, etc. it is actually playing a song, it turns off after 2 minutes no matter what I try with it.I assume the feature is defective on my unit and wil have to take it back."
2,What Happened?,I thought I was doing a good job of shopping around for a decent fm transmitter but I still got something that didn't work for me. The Transpod worked fine but the inserts for the Ipod nano didn't fit my Ipod. You can still plug in the Ipod but it is a loose fit. I thought I would like the extended arm and placement of the Transpod but I found it to be in a dangerous spot. I drive a Jimmy and I had to look down too much and too long to change the music. I am returning this product. I am thinking of buying a hand held transmitter so I can keep a better eye on the road. Either way you are at the mercy of the fm stations in your area. Be prepared for static whether a little or a lot.
5,"Wow, Just wow!","Well, I must say that is a great little gadget! I am in NJ where I get both Philly as well as NY radio stations. I have had NO trouble at all getting this to work.The music comes in clear and crisp. Well worth the 100.00 I spent!This is seriously a good product! I would recommend anyone to purchase one!"
2,Transpod DLO 009-3031 review,"The item requires the dc outlet in your car to be located in a spot that is convienent for your iPod. There is no cord which does not allow you to operate the iPod from any seat. While this is fine for some vehicles, this is unusable for other vehicles, such as minivans where the outlets are on the floor in in hidden areas."
1,Limited waranty where one is really needed for this item,"Worked OK for 3 months of average usage, then broadcast was so bad it was unusable. No matter what frequency, it just basically quit working. Guess I could be more upset if I'd paid full retail. Should have listened to the multiple reviews stating connections that go bad easily, also see poor reviews under same version in white. Just past the 90 day waranty which I should have expected from this manufacturer. There are other options, even some not FM transmitters such as iPod speaker systems for around the same retail price. Be warned about the 90 day waranty."
4,Best of it's Kind.,"Well, this is an excellent product. Out of all of the car-mounting, charging, docking, transmitters, this one offeres the highest quality and best performance available. It however, is not perfect. The only issue with it is that the volume is preset inthe machine itself, so it will only go as loud as your car stereo will allow, not as loud as the ipod AND the stereo. That's still respectively loud without distortion. So all in all, it's a quality product, a little on the pricy side, but as far as this arena goes, ya get what you pay for."
4,Not Bad for the money,"I first tried the iTrip for my Ipod and wasn't impressed. There was too much static and the least little touch caused noise. I've been much happier with the Transpod. I don't know if it's because it is plugged into something metal in the dash or what but the reception is much better, and it makes a nice dash mount holder."
2,Okay...,"My husband and I had some old DLO transpod's that we purchased when they first came out. They were awesome and lasted for about 3 years with tons of use and being left in cold and hot vehicles constantly. My husbands transpod started to sound a little funky, so I purchased this new one for him. Since day 1 the new transpod didn't work properly. The sound is ""off"" and only plays in 1 speaker of our truck. He started using his old transpod again, and it actually sounds better than the crappy new one! We are sending the new one back and we are hoping that the next one has great results like our first couple of transpod's had. Good luck!"
4,its very good,"the quality of this product is great, we live in central kansas so big surprise its easy to find a blank station. and the soound quality is great. but be prepared to send it back when you get it. they sent me the wrong one, so I paid 145.00 for a 80.00 gizmo, and that was a mess it connect easily, no wires and no mess, very clean. although it doesn't automatically find a station for you. thats the only down side."
3,Weak FM transmission power,"It is a good product. My only observations are:1. The FM transmission power is weaker than the Griffin, as I recently was able to compare.2. The connector extension arm is flexible in the sense that it is long enough to reach the most difficult 12V sockets. But, it's not robust enough, as it shakes too much, especially with the heavier IPod or IPhones."
1,Shorted out my click wheel!,This unit shorted out the click wheel on two of my iPods. DLO only offers a 90 day warranty and will will require me to ship both the iPods and the transpod unit to them to verify the defect at my expense! According to the customer service rep even if they confirm that their unit caused the shorts they will not refund my money for the transpod and likely will not replace either of the iPods. Customer service was curt and abrupt at best.Thanks for nothing DLO.
5,Transpod Rocks!!,"I own several ipods and needed a solution for my Dodge Dakota Truck. I was looking for a solution that would mount my pod in a location where I could easily see it since like to change the song often. This fit the bill perfectly. The Transpod fits my Nano and my husbands Video Ipod and our older ipods also. It charges the battery which is really nice. The sound is excellent, and I've never even had to change the radio station it's set to even when traveling to all differnt parts of the state (AZ). Only thing I don't like is my pod would fit much better if I took it's case off, I just don't want to do that each time I take it in and out. So when we go on bumpy dirt roads it sometimes pops out. It doesn't fall out, but it disconnects from the transpod enough to stop playing."
4,Didn't have high expectations,"Actually this works much better than I expected. 100.9 gave me clear, if not hi-fi, music all the way from Santa Barbara to the Bay area.The mounting system leaves a bit to be desired. I would recommend the unit."
2,Really useless here,"Though the product does what it is supposed to, there are just too many FM channels wherever I travel and the quality is not good . It is now my expensive ipod charger in my car."
5,Great for your Car,I bought this for my son-n-law and he is very pleased. There isn't any static and he is able to get reception anywhere. Good price and product.
2,Too much noise,"I'm still looking for a good solution to a car MP3 player without forking over hundreds to get one installed. This was better than the Griffin products I tried, but you still cant' listen to classical music without being annoyed by all of the static. It was OK with the more rock, punk, hip hop stuff when I was driving in my somewhat noisy Jeep, but in a quieter car like my toyota camry it was unbearable."
3,DLO Transpod Review,"The sound quality is good, but the main drawback is the entension arm. On the first day, I was fiddling around with the arm and its screws (there are about five of them) and I accidentally turned a screw too loose. I went to go put it into my car, and realized one screw had fallen out. I looked for it for two hours, and even thought about going to the hardware store to buy a generic one, until I found it on the floor of my car, underneath the seat. Definitely be careful as to not lose any key components on the first day you have the Transpod."
3,DLO 009-3031 ipod FM transpod,"Does not work very well in my 05 Canyon, my radio picks up something on every frequency in the Chicagoland area, but...it works part time in my 06 Pontiac andit works very well in my 02 Dodge."
2,Not as happy as I had hoped,"I don't enjoy this equipment at all. I thought it would be a nice, clear, static-free way to enjoy my IPOD in my car. But there's such a layer of static over the songs, it's hard to make the song out even with the volume all the way up. I wouldn't recommend this. But I don't know what I would recommend. I think they probably all are the same."
3,Quick Review,"Good when you can find an empty station. Unfortunately there are not many empty FM stations in the East Coast. Traveled from Miami to DC, it was a pain trying to listen to my music, constant adjustments."
2,Unacceptable performance,"Bought this to replace the previous version of this because I cracked the arm on the old one. I was pretty happy with the old one, but this one is a different story. The transmission is much weaker than the old one resulting in heavy static. Bass and treble sound very fuzzy. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone."
3,good reception but poor durability!,I purchased this item as a christmas gift for my boyfriend and within a week he complained that the cigarett lighter part detached itself from the transpod! He also complained that the screws within the ipod extension were coming out. Sadly apart from these two major problems the transpod played clearly with no reception problems (we live in New York). If you decide to purchase this item just be careful on the way you handle it because it seems very fragile and unsteady.
1,Horrible,If it was just the static sound you wanted me to review I'd say it was okay on par with many other type of devices. I felt truly ripped off by the rest of it. First of all there was a cord thats needed to connect both the itouch to the dlo and it didnt come with it and I had to go out and spend 10.00 with tax to buy the cord. It cannot charge and play at the same time it messes up. Super flimsy as if it moves around a little bit it would break. The back part where it goes into the car came easily apart the screws fell out somehow and it disfigured itself so I could see the wires. I really would NOT recommend this to anyone. Im disappointed I paid $60 for something like this on amazon...
1,Don't waste your money,"Poor sound quality, I tried it for a two weeks could not get the quality any better."
5,Just what I wanted.,I've always had these types of ipod docks in my car and I will not buy anything else. It charges my ipod (which is great so that pretty much no matter what my ipod never dies) and plays it decently loud enough in my car. It's not cd or radio quality 100% but it does the job.
1,Never worked correctly,Product did not work correctly right out of the box. It wouldn't save the presets. It lasted two weeks and then totally quit working. Replaced the fuses multiple times like the manual said and it still didn't work. I am currently waiting on a replacement.
2,Akward Positioning,"This product doesn't work so well in my mitsubishi eclipse. The plugin for my car is sort of in a akward position for this transpod to fit nicely. Also, the ipod music comes across with a lot of static in some places while driving I have found. And because i had to use both arm attachments instead of just one, the transpod bounces up and down and is unstable...the ipod itself has fallen off of the transpod a few times...BUT if you have a car with the cigarette lighter plug as shown in the picture - it would probably work better. But for a sports car, not so much."
1,DLO TransPod All-in-One Car Solution for iPod (Black),The sound for this Ipod Transpod was absolutely horrible. I sent the product back and I'm still waiting to see if I'll get my refund. I'll never buy electronics from amazon again.
5,Great product,I highly recommend this product! Does exactly what it says it will. Make sure you have plenty of room around your power outlets!
1,Junk,"3 days and it quit working !!! My Jam cast lasted 3 months. Both Cheaply made, I would not buy this brand again. I haven't found anything suitable FM listening. I guess I'll Keep looking !!!"
2,Not good if your dial is full,"This device was easy enough to set up, and was solidly built. It fit snugly in the 12V outlet on my car and was a sturdy base for the iPod. I found 4 good channels in front of my house but then found that when I drove even a mile or two from the house that those four channels didn't sound very good. I live in a city and the FM dial is almost completely full and there are also several small college stations that have very limited range, so when you drive closer to them they start to interfere. I had to send mine back. If you live in a less dense area with plenty of open channels you'll probably be fine."
1,Worked Great for 60 days then fell to pieces,"This is my second iPod to radio transmitter. The first, a Road Trip survived a 3 week road trip and heavy usage before and after. It got stolen, along with my iPod.I got this one when I replaced my iPod. It worked fine, but seemed to turn itself off when I was not using it. I would pull it out and put it back in and it would come back on. Which I thought was a ""feature"" - not a bug. Yesterday, when I pulled it out, the entire top part of it came apart. Some of it even was stuck in the lighter cavity, which I'm not sure how I'm going to get out. I'm guessing it was simply faulty, as the turning off would indicate. I am appalled at how quickly my DLO Transpod self-destructed."
2,disappointed,Tried this for Ipod 160GB. Compared it to a cassette adaptor. Did not want the cassette wire and liked the concept and look of this unit. Unfortunately the sound quality did not compare to the cassette adaptor. Tried it on a Honda Odyssey and Mercedes S500. Also found the unit to be very unstable when using the additional extender. Hard to overcome the laws of physics as it became very top heavy and would not stay securely in the power receptacle. Will be returning the unit.
5,Works great. Sits lower than is safe to view while driving,"In brief:-Very easy to install-Looks pretty good in my car. Clean installation. No wires exposed-Sounded great during my 35 minute commute. Excellent quality FM radioOne thing however is that with this type of FM Transmitter the iPod sits pretty low (below the A/C unit for me). It is really unsafe to take your eyes off the road to operate the iPod at that low a height. Some other transmitters allow you to hold the iPod in your hand to operate, which would allow you to hold it higher up and closer to your view of the road. Also hard to share the iPod with the passenger because it is attached to the ashtray.Overall I gave it 5 stars because it was a simple elegant solution to the problem of listening to my iPod in the car."
5,Great product!,"After finding the Griffin iTrip completely worthless, I tried the DLO Transpod in my '97 Civic. I use it with my iPod 30GB and regularly travel all over the San Francisco bay area, and with rare exceptions I can leave it on one channel and get a clear sound. For those few times when I have gotten static, it's been very easy to use the presets to switch to a clear frequency while I'm driving. The arm connector isn't super sturdy, and sometimes falls over when I take a turn too fast, but for the most part it does just fine. (It seems much sturdier than the white 1st generation version.) It's easy to unplug it and stick in the glove compartment so it's always there when I need it. Overall, I've been extremely happy with this product and definitely recommend it to others."
3,So so,"This product is decent, but anything with bass (rap,r & b, etc.) will not sound good. I listened to my friend's transdock and it sounded much better. Should have gotten that product."
2,broken xmission,"Works great in my '01 chevy workvan, but sucks in my chevy s-10 and volvo xc-90. monster cable is more versatile(as far as consistent in diff vehicles), but the plug got loose with use and cuts out badly, which is why i tried this product."
2,"Starts promising, doesn't go anywhere","A friend picked this book up from the library based on reading the first two pages - I bought it based on the same. It had me hooked for a while as having so much information packed in each sentence kept my interest; however, while that format works for an intimate scene between two people it has the opposite effect when it takes three pages to do simple tasks like getting dressed. Often, the action feels like it's extremely slow because so much information goes into every meticulous detail.There's also a section where we get to see what went on during the protagonist's childhood. Again, I was intrigued as it offered a view into what crafted Iago into the man he is, but then I was disappointed to find out that it became to BULK of the novel.Ultimately, this book had a lot of promise but the character never grows and the story (whatever there is) gets lost in the details."
2,Unsympathetic Main Character Makes This Book A Trial To Read,"I considered waiting until paperback for to read this book, and how I wish I had! Not only is Golding's writing style needlessly verbose (even the dialogue swims amid multi-page paragraphs), the main character, James/Iago is a snotty spoiled brat which makes it difficult to sympathize with his plight. The book also cuts between the adult James' experience with a male prostitute (which bookends the story) and his entire life as a student from first grade to high school. Did he exist during his 20s? A total snore, and not highly recommended."
2,Another first novel,"Mr Golding's first novel chronicles the life of Santiago Moore Zamora. He was born in Spain where he lived until he was sent to boarding school in England. Certain passages in this novel are of real interest: Santiago's affection for his nurse Mam?zelle, his solitude in the company of others, his disgust for physical activity, his perception of the futility of social behaviour and his attachment to his teachers which leads to the loss of his virginity. The reader may freely skip parts one and five of Mr Golding's novel, unless he needs to learn that some homosexuals are obsessively preoccupied with their own body and clothing and that because one of their major concerns in life is sex, their bound to be unhappy, their life being an abomination indeed."
4,Crabb Family CD,Very nice CD. It has alot of the Crabb family music. Has great songs. Also bought this for my mother and my CD is already worn out from use.
4,Just as pictured,they are cute but i could tell any diff. from reguar dishes - then again all my dishes are nice. the price is fair and they are still in great shape 6mnths later. (no chips!) im not real cautious with dishes either. they soak clean super fast too. =)
3,"Response to comments made by Margo Rice ""Rai Fan""","Margo, the reason why some of the tracks on this newly released album are mis-mastered is because these tracks were copied directly off of Khaled's way too old tracks that were recorded in his home studeo in cassettes back in Algeria in the early 80s. They are not professional, state-of-the-art productions or recordings. But back in the days they were like top notch. Remeber, studeo productions in Arab countries in the early 80s was extremely poor. However, there has been some drastic imporvements. Why Khaled to decided to re-produce his junky old tracks? We really don't know. But may be he wanted to offer his fans an idea about how rough his early days were."
3,Let the Buyer Beware!,"This three-CD compilation set includes some awesome ""Cheb Khaled"" songs - and I mean AWESOME! However, a few tracks were mis-mastered; they are either too slow or too fast, and really distort Khaled's voice. In fact, some of the tracks are too painful to listen to (ouch! ouch! yikes!). An example is a live cut of ""Ya-Rayi,"" ---just plain bad. Another one, equally nightmarish, is ""Alech Tomouni."" From what I understand, ""Spirit of Rai"" is just one more on a growing list of the ""cheaply engineered"" compilations Khaled has been releasing, this one having been pressed in Portugal. Let the buyer beware."
2,"More athestic looking than baseboard, but noisy.","We had these heaters professionally installed 2 and 1/2 years ago. I thought they would look better than the baseboard heaters, which they do, but the noise they make far outweighs their asthetic looks. I wrote this review because we are looking to replace them as one of them still heats, but the cage blower stopped working, of course making it quite a fire hazard. I think we will change to the in floor heating and would not put these in again, unless they came up with a quiter model."
4,Works Well. Easy to Install,"We bought this together with a King thermostat as an additional heater for our kitchen. The existing baseboard heater was very insufficient.We are very happy with the heater and the thermostat. The heater puts out a great deal of heat and gets the temperature of the room elevated very quickly. It is a little noisier than we would like but not really unacceptable.We built our own enclosure for this. We made a little door that opens up, and matches the rest of the surrounding woodwork. So we did not use the white grille that comes with the heater. King sell several configurations. You can get the heater with the grille and motor but without the wall can (which is a necessity) but you cannot get the motor and the wall can without the grille. I think King should offer that configuration."
1,"Yep, Not for me!","What can I say about this book! Learn Marathi in 30 days, I have had this book for 6 years...and still know nothing! And this is coming from an American woman who married a Maharastrian man; this is his and his family's native language. So I have to and want to learn to communicate properly with his family. This book is meant for people that have already learned a slang of Marathi or any other language. The book breaks everything down into their vowels and consonants and how to recognize the written language...etc...there are phrases, but it doesn't show you how to pronounce the words at all. I have been searching for something that would teach me correctly, but I guess the best way to learn is actually being there in India and conversing with the people! Hope this helps!"
2,It's an over priced adapter,You can get the same results from a 1300Ma computer/digital camera ac adapter for a third of the price.
5,amazing!!,"I saw this group in Barcelona and they have such an amazing energy surrounding them that kept the international crowd interested and hopping as well as infusing their music with influences from hiphop, techno, and jazz! awesome group live and on cd!"
5,bomb,I just saw them live and it was one of the best performances I have ever witnessed. It was their first in this country - GO SEE THEM!!! The energy was fantastic! The music is so good - international trip hop. WOW.
3,Beautiful start but the rest...!!!,"Actually, I bought this CD for the first song imagining that the other songs would be as good as the first one. However, they are not even close to the quality of the first song. The album does not have a consistent melody or unity in it. Also, African flavors do not go well with the Latin tunes!"
2,NOT A GREAT SHOW,"As someone who has heard many Nico shows and is a big fan, I don't really like this one. First off, beware of duplication, this is the same show that is the 2nd disk of the Aura Anthology. You might as well get that if you want this show. The main problem with this one is it's badly recorded. The vocals are up front and too loud. This is not the proper way to hear Nico's voice. You can hear every flaw in her voice and it also takes any from the rest of the band. Her voice needs the echo of a club or hall and it needs distance. I would highly recommmend Do Or Die. This is great. It was properly recorded from the audience and not a line feed. To date Do or Die is the only Nico live release that properly captures her live sound. I think Nico knew this as Do or Die is one of the infamous tapes that she herself sold at shows. There are others I'm sure and hope to see more of these former cassette tapes released."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I bought this book hoping it would be something I could share with my son after his recent suicide attempt. First and foremost, this is a very educational book, but most of the stuff were things we already learned while he was in the psych ward. Secondly, I just did not find their solution realistic. The book makes it sound like the best thing possible for depressed, suicidal teens is to send them away to a rehab program. Great for those who can afford it, not so inspiring for those of us who can only offer what's available locally. Overall I was disappointed by it's preachiness and lack of depth and sincerity."
4,Enjoyed,"I enjoyed reading the book and felt like I was right there with the family going through this crisis. I rooted for Will all the way through and couldn't wait to hear of his improvements. But, in the end I was a little frustrated though at the fact that he never does appreciate all his parents do. They spent $5,000 a month on a therapy school only few can dream of. I was hoping to see in the end that he truly saw a light and I guess I just felt like the book ended with him still being depressed and immature."
4,Finally from the Perspective of the depression patient,"When I first bought this book I didn't expect much. But, as I read the book and followed the amazing journey Will had to make in the steps to keep control of his depression and not get the better of him the more I enjoyed it. This young man is a true inspiration for kids and young adults who suffer from depression that there are things like hope and a better quality of life awaiting us if we just keep holding on a bit longer to realize it ourselves."
5,One of the best of the Gooseberry patch,"I usually like to tab the pages of the recipes that I would like to try, but I would have to tab this entire book! I recently made the apple cinnamon bars for my daughters 5 k class and they were such a hit! ( They were for Johnny Appleseed Day 9-26)I just cant say enough good things about this particular book! So many different ideas & recipes, so little time!"
2,save your money,"This book manages to list 150 things you should know in the form of a question. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell you the answer. I was left with the situation of having 150 things I should know but still don't. If I had purchased it myself, I would have sent it back."
4,Great Photos,A wonderful reference book on Maine Coon cats. I loved learning so much about this breed.
2,A good book...for ADULTS,"This is a very good book but I am highly disappointed in... age recommendation...ages 9 to 12? Parts of this book include attempted rape scenes and masturbation scenes. Although well written and a good case study for adults, it is not for children."
2,Save your money,"This CD was done on the cheap. The sound quality is poor. There are absolutely no credits and only a date of the original recording, not even the title of the original LP release. Much of it comes from Take 10 and Desmond Blue.The first 5 tunes are with full orchestra (dub'ed in and souding awful). The last are quartets (Jim Hall is also on many tracks).Desmond was a fine musician and deserves to be heard, but if you're looking for a place to start almost anyplace else would be better. Try Take 10 -- but don't take this one."
3,works but is it better?,"I purchased this because I really like eating protein for a snack, especially hard boiled eggs. I was expecting a 5 minute cook time (I really had no idea) and that is not what I got.This is easy to set up, it is three parts, you put water in the bottom, place the eggs on the tray, put the top on, and throw it in the microwave.The only issue is that for me to get hard boiled eggs in my microwave (Samsung Over the Range 900 watts) it takes 13 minutes to cook. If I just throw a pot on the stove it takes 20 minutes to cook four eggs.Since this is a three piece thing that recommends hand washing (top shelf dishwasher safe), I am having a hard time with thinking this is actually a time saver.I think this will be a product that goes into my donate pile...."
1,It fell a part and it's too hot to handle.,it worked the first 4 times I used it (I used it once a week). Then the metal cap on the inside cover came out and it wouldn't go back in flush with the top of the egg - which caused it to spark in the microwave.Even if that hadn't happened the egg is hard to handle out of the microwave as it's really hot. Some sort of handle or at least a pull tab at the top would have been helpful. You can't get the top off until it cools down.
2,Don't use when you're hungry,"OK, I'll be the lone voice of dissent for this product. I think the design wasn't well thought out. After you cook the egg(s), you can't use over mitts to twist open the top because it's very round and very smooth and oven mitts don't provide enough traction. I ended up putting on rubber gloves so I could get a decent grip (bear in mind it is very hot inside). After many minutes, I managed to separate the top from the bottom to retrieve my cooked eggs. The recommended times in the instruction pamphlet were way off; the soft-boiled eggs I was looking forward to turned out to be hard-boiled. I will grant that cooking times are usually trial-and-error; it's just the design that I have a problem with. Really, an egg cooker doesn't have to take the form of an egg!"
5,Convenient!,"I bought this egg cooker on a whim and, surprisingly, am very satisfied with this purchase. It does what it claims: Per my microwave, it will cook four eggs in 10:00 minutes nearly perfectly every time. Although a stove top pot will also accomplish this cooking feat, this egg cooker removes the worry (of overcooking), the inconvenience (of having to be mindful of a boiling pot), and the mess (of needing to wash a sizable pot afterwards). I highly--and unexpectedly--recommend this product."
2,poor quality and boom boom go eggs,Used this 3 times before the 2 piece plastic and aluminum top separated and wouldn't snap securely into place. Top and bottom of cooker don't seal together well. After 10th use experienced eggsplosion which was a total bitch to clean up.
5,Loving it.,"Simply put - Eggs made easy. Loving it so far, Easy to clean makes perfect eggs every time. Takes about 10 minutes and the eggs are ready."
5,Perfect eggs,"Just got the egg boiler and decided to try just two eggs, in case it didn't work. I had to find out the wattage on my microwave and then followed the directions. The eggs were perfect-none of that dark color you get around the yolk when you boil them too long , and no undone area in the yolk. It's so great to buy something and have it work so perfectly the first time."
5,Perfect for soft boiled eggs!!,This is the greatest for fixing eggs at work. I love a good soft boiled egg and this product makes it easy. It is so simple yet works so well.
4,Works well,"I've always been somewhat skeptical with these microwavable items, but this is a GREAT little item to have! Fast and easy! I received mine yesterday and had to test it right away. 8 minutes for medium cooked centers (using jumbo eggs) and 10 minutes for hard. The bottom is hot, so use a towel or something to handle it once you are ready to remove it from the microwave."
5,Microwave Egg Boiler,"It works great, and it's small (6"" high, 5"" diameter) and easy to use. May require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave. For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9-10 min for hard eggs on high power (700W microwave).It does get very hot, so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel. I place the whole thing under the cold tap, then remove the top, and cool the eggs under running water for a minute before peeling."
5,Makes perfectly cooked eggs!,"I've used many egg cookers and this is the best! It works so easy - fill with water, add eggs, and microwave for 8 minutes. The eggs come out perfect every time. Its very compact and easy to store."
5,Great egg cooker!!,"This is my 3rd Nordic Ware egg cooker, I still use my first and the other 2 are for my grown children, we all love hard boiled eggs on salad or for making egg dishes and just for hard boiled eggs to eat plain, it is great, make soft boiled eggs too!"
3,Eggs break all the time,"My microwave is 700 watts. I put 4 eggs in this egg cooker and microwaved for 6 minutes, the eggs are still medium raw. I then microwaved for 10 minutes, the eggs were perfectly done:the yolk is solid but orange. However, about seventy percent of the time, one or two eggs would break and the egg whites came out and sticked to the aluminum holder, otherwise, it works."
5,"I call it ""a good egg""","Three parts to this little wonder: a bottom, middle, and top. The bottom has a fill line that you fill water to. The middle is Nordic Ware's egg-cradling tray that supports the 4 eggs you position into their nuking vessel. The top snaps into place to provide the thermo-dynamics that surround and help to cook the eggs.This product is dishwasher safe and easy. I like hard boiled eggs, so with my 1000 watt microwave, I warm eggs for 8 minutes. The directions chart also shows the times for soft and medium boiled with a few other wattage settings.This is not the first Nordic Ware kitchen product I've purchased. This is probably the most used. I recommend the Minnesota based company to anyone for their standard of quality."
2,Not safe,"I purchased this to support my high protein diet. Set my microwave for 9 min, one of the eggs exploded after 7 min messing my entire microwave.The other thing is this product not made in USA as amazon product description says, it's made in Taiwan. I wouldn't buy this if I knew, I'll give it a couple of more runs and if not working will go back to good old school boiling eggs."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Usually 2 out of 4 eggs get cracked. I stopped using it. I have bought electrical Egg Genie which is for 7 eggs and very happy with it, just use vinegar to clean the inside metal part."
5,I'm Having An Egg Salad Sandwich for Lunch Today,"I used this product for the first time this morning and had absolute success. I read the other reviews about having to finesse the time to get the perfect egg, well, I guess I lucked out. I put four eggs (Omega 3, not that it matters to the cooking of it, filled the device with water up to the convenient water mark, and set my micro for 10 minutes. I waited 2 additional minutes before taking it out of the microwave. I dumped the eggs into a waiting bowl of ice water, because I was making my lunch to take to work with me. When the eggs cooled, they were easily peeled and cooked to perfection. How easy is that?I plan to include more eggs in my diet as they are low in calories and high in protein. I also plan to eat the yolks because of the high nutrient content. If you use boiled eggs, I highly recommend this product. As Julia would say ""Bon Appetit!"""
5,love it,I love the microwave boiled egg cooker - I put 2 in the microwave while getting ready for work and they are done in 7 minutes. Absolutely love it.
3,Bad shape - Needs a handle!,"The smooth egg shape is difficult to handle because there is no convenient place to grip it. It takes two hands to move it around. It gets too hot to handle and if you use a towel or pad to lift it out of the microwave, hot water leaks out of the seam between the top and bottom, soaks into the towel and burns you anyhow. Other than this problem, it works well. You still need to allow for the initial temperature of the eggs and the size of the eggs, of course."
2,Broken after a few month,Poor quality. The up cover was separated from the inner metal cap and make it dangous to use in microwave oven.
1,Fabulous but only for a while,"I bought a Nordic egg cooker for a friend, and she raved about it so much that I got one, too. It cooked eggs perfectly for a while and was easy to use. Unfortunately, part of it is a band that helps seal the product in the microwave. My cleaning lady threw mine out, thinking it was a rubber band, and that was that. My friend's product warped slightly shortly thereafter, and she could no longer use hers either. So it's back to boiling on the stove. The plastic needs to be more durable for long-term use, and the band should be part of the product--that is, attached to it."
2,Short-lived,"This thing is great in theory and I did get a couple of perfectly done medium eggs out of it in the beginning. I used it twice and then found that the lid stopped ""snapping"" on to the bottom half. Not that it ever even really snapped tightly but now it's simply ill-fitting and nearly falls off which could result in exploding eggs if I decide to risk it. My microwave isn't even particularly powerful and it seems to have caused the plastic to warp. Not worth the price no matter how cheap."
2,Erm...,"I bought this because it had such good reviews... I got one and used it a few times perfectly without problems. until it blew up in the microwave. yep, BLEW up. Now Im sure i did everything as i was meant to.. so i really am being objective about this review..what can i say? this was my experience, ive decided to buy a more reliable egg cooker which does not involve the microwave..."
5,It works! It's brilliant!,"8.5 minutes in a 1000 watt oven does the trick. No mess, no huge quantity of boiling water. Read the instructions-- it's easy!"
4,Nordic Ware egg cooker,Have used it a few times and it hard boils up to 4 eggs in microwave without any problem. Its a good product however it gets hot to touch and using oven mitts its tricky to twist open as the oval surface is very smooth and difficult to get traction. Will have to devise some technique to open it after use. Maybe run cold water on the entire unit to cool it off or something.
5,No more boiling eggs on the stove!,"Open the egg cooker and remove plate. Fill bottom of cooker with water to the line where indicated. Place the egg holder plate back on the bottom half, put four eggs in the holder, place cover on top and microwave for 7 minutes. Perfect boiled eggs every time. *Note: be sure to fill bottom with water to indicated line. Not enough water can cause eggs to explode."
5,Great Eggs,"For a fast easy to use egg cooker at a fair price, this is it. An excellent gift your friends & family will enjoy."
1,Not a good choice,"The product is a waste of money. It is cumbersome, takes up lots of room on the shelf, and is no quicker (or more reliable) than cooking eggs the old-fashioned way by boiling in a pot on the stove!"
3,I succumbed to kitchen gadget disease.,"This is easy to use and does what is described. Easy to clean. Super hot when you first pull it out, so be careful- not for young children to be using. If you don't mind it taking up shelf space then I would go ahead and purchase it, but if you are at all cramped on space skip this."
4,Boiled eggs almost a cinch!,"I've always enjoyed soft and hard boiled eggs but they've always been a bit tricky or labor intensive. You've all been there, hard-boiled are soft or soft-boiled are hard. The water takes forever to boil and you turn away and presto it's out of control. I've even used special thermometers for preparation. Until I broke it. This microwave egg boiler takes a lot of the guesswork out. I have found that paying attention to the egg size and number of eggs can make a difference in the outcome. I can't soft boil a large egg the same length of time as a extra large. So pay attention to the manufacturer guidelines. Be careful too about picking it up or removing the top; it's hot. All in all a very useful device."
3,No advantage,"Nordic Ware 64802 Microwave Egg BoilerSo what's the big deal with a gismo that can burn your unsuspecting hand? A small saucepan with eggs from fridge starting with room temperature water over a gas stove will boil eggs to required degree (2 min for soft, 3 min for medium, 4 min for hard."
5,"Amazing Product, very effective.","Awesome, really works! Order with confidence. I tried it on my 800w Panasonic microwave, perfect results at 7 minutes. Could you believe cooking perfect boiled eggs on a microwave oven? I didn't until I tried this product."
4,Great little Gadget!,"Used this for the first time last night and WOW! Its works beautifully. My egg cooker doesn't ""snap"" closed, just kind of lays on top but it still worked. I had to microwave 2 min. longer (10 min) and was simply amazed. Other than the pieces not fitting snug - its wonderful!"
1,didn't last 6 months,"This product was AMAZING at first! I was eating boiled eggs every morning for breakfast. So easy and fast. After about a month or so one of the eggs would crack or burn every now and then. But I thought no biggie, it's not like it happens all the time. The last time I used it both eggs exploded in my microwave. The explosion forced the microwave door to open and the inside was a complete mess! I was so disappointed, mainly because I loved this little thing oh so much. And the price was great! Time to find a new one :("
4,Wow!,"I just wanted to add another positive review for this great gadget. It works very well indeed. I love hard boiled eggs but hate leaving half the white inside the shell when I peel them. My Egg Boiler showed up yesterday and I followed directions and boiled two free range organic eggs. I peeled one hot and it came out perfectly, not sticking to the inside of the shell! I refrigerated the other one and peeled it for breakfast this morning. Came out just fine cold, too! I am impressed.My only problem with it is that even after letting the unit sit for two minutes it's still too hot to open with your bare hands. I used oven mitts and ended up up ending it in the sink to drain it. So it's not 100% perfect, but it does boil a very good egg!"
2,Works but can be dangerous,"We've used this for a long time, and while it works and is convenient, it has a couple of design flaws. Over time, the top of the egg has come to fit more and more loosely on the bottom, so that you have to be very careful it doesn't fall off. Added to that--and more seriously--the cutesy factor of having the model shaped like an egg means that it isn't very stable. If you aren't very careful every time, lifting this out of the microwave can be dangerous, with superheated water in the base that that spill out far too easily from rolling of the tiny base... as the huge blisters on my leg prove..."
2,Good concept,"The concept of this is good. However, I have limited hand strength and this was very hard to open and close. I couldn't use it because of this. For most, it will probably be fine."
3,Takes some tweaking,"The unit comes with directions for 600W, 800W, and 1000W microwaves. So I adjusted the time for my 1300W monster. Two eggs for 6 1/2 minutes were just shy of hard boiled. One egg for 6 minutes 40 seconds blew up like napalm all over the microwave. I think the time has to be adjusted for the number of eggs you're using. I'll just keep experimenting."
1,Misleading product description and a safety concern!,"The product description says ""No more hot water and delicate maneuvering ..........."". This isn't accurate in my experience. This is little more than a giant thin plastic Easter egg that you must load about a third full of water, then remove scorching hot from the microwave. I don't find the egg shape with no handles easy to maneuver, and do find it too easy to burn oneself."
3,"works well, but difficult to open","Nordic Ware products are generally well designed, but this one has a big flaw. It does soft- or hard-boil eggs as promised--though you will have to adjust the timing according to the strength of your oven--but it is very difficlt to open once the eggs are cooked. The surface is smooth and slippery, with no grips or indentations, and too big around the circumferance to hold firmly while twisting and lifting the top. The device must be kept level while opening or you will spill boiling water on your hands while trying to retrieve the eggs. I like the speed and convenience of using the microwave to boil eggs, but opening this device is a pain."
1,Lid Became Loose After Few Uses! Unsafe!,After only using this cooker about six times a section would no longer stay securely attached to the bottom portion and after cooking I had the misfortune of having to deal with just-boiled water leaking out of it as I tried to remove it from my overhead microwave. I discarded it due to this because it was unsafe and I hope it does not happen to others or cause injury. Very frustrating to say the least.
5,Easy to use and the eggs turn out perfect!,"I was hoping that this would work well and it does. I got perfect eggs the very first time I used it.All you do is put the water in, add the eggs, put the top on and start the microwave. I was skeptical but it really does work.The only scary thing is taking it out of the microwave. I'm always a little afraid I will somehow drop it or spill the super hot water. But, that hasn't happened. I use an oven mitt when I remove it from the microwave because it is very hot. The whole thing goes in the sink under running water and when it's cooled down a bit, I can take the eggs out and start peeling them. They always peel very easy, too.The eggs come out just like I like 'em! Soft but firm with a nice yellow yolk."
2,not so easy.,"At first I was so impressed with this item, found in walmart for 4$, I love soft boiled eggs but it always is a hassle for me to cook them the way I like, so this one worked fine in my microwave, then we moved and sold everything, started looking for another one, found it in walmart for 7$, the construction was bad (aluminum parts came off), but I kept it ( didn't know that there are better ones in the market), also even with practice I am still unable to control the softness with my different micorwave, the time, after how long to cool them, it is hectic, they never come the same everytime, also the risk of burning your hands with the spell ( especially with high microwave), the only good thing about it is the very cheap price, but I will pay extra to get something easier and more predictable..."
1,I couldn't even open the thing...,"Don't waste your money....could not open. Not a good design. If they put something on the top to grip, would be better idea."
5,Best darn egg cooker this side of the Mississippi,This little device cooks white eggs fully without the crumbly effect you get when you boil them in water and try to peel off the shell. They peel just great! The only time I've has a probelm is when the egg shell is cracked to begin with. They sometimes blow the top of the plastic egg off the device. But never a mess in the microwave since the egg contains any potential mess! Just put in 4 eggs and drop an english in the toaster and less than ten minutes later you have a great no fuss no mess breakfast. Worth their weight in gold!
5,Careful its hot!,"as in it's a hot item. I had to cook the eggs a little longer than the 10 minutes for hard boiled eggs to turn out and the eggs have to sit for a bit to cool down to harden completely. But beats having to buy a separate plug in device. It's simple to clean and stores easily. It cooks 4 eggs at a time, so great for a single bachelor like me. No more burned eggs left on the stove. It's worth the $9 bucks to give it a try. I'm about to make some deviled eggs right now."
5,Cooks a Great Egg!,I read all the reviews before I bought this and I agree pretty much with what everyone said. It cooks a great egg and it's easy to clean up.
2,not consistent,"Once I cooked the eggs at the exact time according to the manual, one egg burst and the entire lid popped off, each of the remaining eggs were all cooked differently, and not to the consistency I wanted. Poor quality egg cooker!"
2,Explosions,"This worked well for about two weeks, but since then the eggs explode. I mean REALLY explode! I can't figure out how to stop it. It's a pain to clean up, because the entire egg disintegrates. I suggest the egg genie. I have that one at work and it makes perfects eggs with no explosions."
1,dangerous product,This egg shaped cooker gets very hot and since it is shaped like an egg with a very smooth surface one has to use both hands and a potholder to lift it out of the microwave. Even this way it is slippery and possible to spill boiling water. Taking the top off and dumping out the water is also risky. i am throwing mine away.
1,Worked three times then failed - dangerous,"Like some others, this lasted for about five uses before the lid started to pop off during heating. I thought at first I hadn't put it on tightly, and reattached it. It popped off a couple of more times before one of the eggs cracked.Like others mentioned, this is awkward to handle and gets very hot.Great idea, terrible execution."
2,Perfect at first - DOESN'T LAST,"I was happy with this item and used it frequently (once a week) for about 6 months. The silver parts were discolored after first run through the microwave, but continued to work. In the sixth month of use, the top would pop off after 4 minutes of microwaving. I would put the top back on and restart the cooking. Finally today it popped off twice in 4 minutes. The third time it popped off and then the eggs exploded all over the microwave. It has become unusable.Also note: Very hot! The top, the bottom, and the eggs cannot be handled for at least 10 minutes after hard-boiling."
5,Microwave Egg Boiler is perfect!,So fast and easy to hard boil eggs. I look forward to using it in the summer when it is hot and humid and it won't add extra heat from the stove!
5,This thing is awesome,This Boiler works amazingly good. My breakfast is done as fast as my coffee and best of all the boiler remains clean and is very easy to wash.
2,Egg cooker,It cooked the eggs after the second try at the top cooking time but this product is very dangerous!! The base has water in it and when you remove it from the microwave it is boiling hot. The top of the egg cooker is difficult to get off and I almost scalded my hand. I was fortunate that I used cooking mitts and the hot water got on the mitts and not my hands!! I do not recommend this product.
2,Explosive Cooker,This cooker worked well for about a year. Once it exploded; blew the door open on the microwave and shot egg out on to the stove below. Some egg was lightly cooked so I know I didn't overcook. I used it a couple more months and again another explosion about 2/3's into the cooking time. I threw it away because it could cause burns if the flying egg hits me.
3,Ok product but i still havent gotten exactly what i want,It worked only ok because i havent been able to get the hard yolk that i like with it yet but so far so good.
2,Explosion,"Not as easy to use as I thought it might be. I put one egg in just to test it and it exploded all over the microwave. Maybe I didn't get the top on tightly enough, but it is just as easy to cook an egg in a pan because it still takes 10 minutes in the microwave."
4,AT LAST,"Just got this item via Fedex. I am a lover of soft boiled eggs on toast. Always trying to guess the exact time etc, detered the old way.First use was right on. I filled the bottom with 374 grams of water, and added 30 sec to the cooking time to compensate for my 950 watts microwave [...], and the result was great. Make sure you fill it to the line exactly. I use digital scales which may be a bit excessive, but I'm retired and don't have that much to do on my off golf days. Highly recommended. The only problem I have found is that whites seem to stick to the shell, much more than the old way."
1,Does not last,"It worked well for about 9 months. Then eggs starting cracking and the lid didn't close. After about a year it is useless, eggs explode and the lids does not fit anymore.A poor quality product. Good idea but needs re-engineering."
5,It Works,"Seems to work as advertised. It is not just a plastic housing. There is a metal shield molded in, presumably to prevent the microwaves from directly reaching the eggs, and relying on the steam to do the cooking."
5,Works great for fresh eggs!!,if you have hens then you know that trying to peel FRESH eggs that have been hard boiled is next to impossible. This works great now i can peel the eggs beautifully and enjoyed deviled eggs produced by my own chickens
5,Super Super,I thought it wouldn't work but it works!!!!!! I bought 3 because a lot of my friends told me to buy then one. :D This is so easy to use 5/5 stars!!
4,kind of fun....,"I love hard boiled eggs, but I am not a fan of making them. I thought this egg boiler would be fun to try. It worked well, but you will probably need some trial runs to find the best cook time for your individual microwave. The suggested times were close, but not quite how I like my eggs. I also had a little bit of trouble peeling the egg shells off at first, but overall it was still easier than expected to remove the shells.Overall I really like the product, and I went back and bought another one for my mother. I would say its a good idea for people who don't need to make a lot of eggs at once (4 at a time is the max) and who don't mind using a few eggs to optimize cooking times. Mine will certainly get a good amount of use."
2,Better to hardboil eggs the old-fashioned way,"I was excited by this product - it got good reviews and I thought it would be great to be able to hard-boil a couple of eggs without getting out a pot if I just wanted some to cut up and put in a tuna salad or whatever. This takes just as long, maybe longer, than cooking them on the stove. The results are variable - it's hard to figure out how long to cook them depending on the egg size. I don't remember that ever being an issue with eggs cooked on the stove.So, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product."
5,it replaced my $40 electric egg cooker.,I have used several different electric egg cooker.Some broken some still working.I think this one will be my last egg cooker.Easy to use nothing can go wrong and it will last forever.
4,Easier than doing it the old fashion way!,"I hate having to wait for boiling water, toss my eggs in, then lose a few because they crack. This makes it way easier, the clean up is easy, and the eggs are cooked perfectly."
1,Horrible! Eggs blew up twice!,"I've been using this product for about 3-4 months now.. and eggs blew up twice. Seems you have to keep with the same brand/size of eggs or if you buy another brand (even if the same size), they'll take less/more time and then blow up in a microwave. Very scary to hear the huge BOOM and extremely unreliable! After the blow up, the microwave is very hard to clean - but the worst is the top part of the egg cooker, blown up egg sticks to it and nothing will scrape it off.. i finally threw out mine!"
2,Eggsplosion!,"I've used this product for the past couple of months and I absolutely loved it! ...right up until this morning when it exploded in the microwave. My cats ran for cover and the KA-BOOM! sound nearly gave me heart failure... and then instead of breakfast I spent the next 45 minutes cleaning up the mess. There were eggs everywhere--on the counters, the stovetop, the floor -- every surface within 2 feet of the microwave got pelted with fine egg particles (and the microwave door was still closed). Well, it was nice while it lasted. I won't be buying another one though."
4,This thing is wonderful!,"I love boiled eggs and I love egg salad but I've never been able to boil an egg consistently well. It seems like I always undercooked or overcooked. Even when I got it just right, peeling the shell ripped chunks out of the egg white. That problem is now solved. I have a 1300W Panasonic microwave and cooking 4 eggs on high for 9 minutes yielded PERFECT results. I could not be happier. However, there is one flaw in this device that prevents me from giving it 5 stars and that is opening it after it's done cooking. This baby is seriously hot coming out of the microwave so you MUST use oven mitts or something similar to handle it. Trying to open this smooth egg with oven mitts is like trying to trim your nose hair with a weedeater, it can be done but it's not easy and will likely be painful. I'll have to invest in some fairly thick rubber gloves to be able to grip this thing well enough to get it open while it's hot but other than that I really love this little bugger!"
5,Absolutely awesome!,"Love it! Love it! Love it!Best innovation! The glowing reviews and (their) methods to 'cook' the perfect hard-boiled egg inspired me to purchase. I'm having eggs almost every day since it's so easy! I just leave the components in the drying rack for next 'cooking' time.Highly recommend this no-fuss, energy-saving (electrical & self) semi-wierd device."
5,Works Great!,"I bought this product several years ago & have used it many times to hard boil eggs in the microwave. It works great & you can ""hard boil"" up to 4 eggs in the microwave at one time in less than 10 minutes depending on how ""hard"" you want your eggs. After they are done, let them cool a few minutes or you can put them in cold water to cool them quicker. I have used it for company at breakfast & they were so impressed they wanted to get one too. The directions for this product are very easy...fill with water, place eggs on the holder, put on lid & put in the microwave for however many minutes (depending on the wattage of your microwave) let sit one minute (be careful when taking it out, it's VERY hot)...now you have hard boiled eggs! (I put them in cold water after so we can eat them quicker.)"
2,I prefer just using a pot on the stove.,"This is no easier or quicker than a pot on the stove. I love kitchen gadgets, but this one wasn't worth keeping. The only reason I'd suggest buying this is if you don't have a stove. If you live in a dorm or want to make eggs in a hotel with just a microwave, this might be good.If you have a proper kitchen with a saucepan at your disposal just boil your eggs the old fashioned way:5-steps to Boiling Eggs:1. Place eggs in saucepan with water about 1""-2"" over the eggs.2. Bring pot to a boil, no lid.3. Turn off the heat once boiling, put the cover on the saucepan.4. Set timer for about 12 minutes.5. Drain water and run cold water over the eggs to cool them down.Done."
1,Nordic Ware Microwaye Egg Cooker,This is not worth the cost at any price. Much easier to cook eggs in a pan of water. The only advantage of microwave cooking is it takes less time. I tried it twice and then threw the product away.
2,Flimsy,The whole egg cooker will not screw together properly. It keeps coming open. Just another gimmick.
3,A basic start,"I was excited to get this book, but it turns out to not quite be what I was looking for. I wanted more activities and less explanation. The text is really simple, but long and without many pictures, which makes me wonder who their audience is-- you can't really read this to kids and it will bore adults, most of whom will know all this anyway. Ah, well, at least it's a jumping-off point."
5,you cant do any better for the price,"a must have, i have had hand me downs going on 26 years now, my girlfriend bought faberware about the same time i was getting all my relatives old sets, they were great , but looking very aged, she has has farberware swears by it all these years, still looks like new, just now bought the 16 quart pot, wont buy anything else, i too, since i have bought my set, i will not go any where else but to faberware, cooks great, cleans easy and looks classy on my stove. buy it , you wont be disapointed."
5,Social Work Values,A must have for any Social Worker. Well written. Approachable. Organized. Clear and concice. Frederick Reamer is one of the authorities in Social Work. Along with his exerience on NPR this book is a must for any student as well.
5,Heart to Heart Stories for Grandparents,This item was received on time in great condition. Thank you for your prompt service.
3,A bargain - sort of,"This is a reprint of design procedures circa 1919. They knew it all back then, so if you are still designing transformers by hand, go for it."
5,What was hoped for with Glastnost,"Some of us still do like watching thriller movies with a moral. This one doesn't seem to have lots of awards but it was suspenseful, with a fine cast. I'm glad it expressed appreciation for something as meaningful as Gorbachev's efforts, and gave some fine performers the chance to do that."
1,Hardly Korean...try gibberish,"This book was a gigantic disappointment. I expected it to provide me with insight into the beauty of the Korean Language. I was entranced by a comment describing wonderful articles and distinct chronologies. Overall, however, I found myself angered and annoyed with what was a rude awakening to one's woman's desire to embarass a rich culture with trite. I think Ms. Kim-Reneau needs to spend less time boring the reader, and more time researching her material."
5,Best London Guide,We always make sure that our overseas visitors have a copy of this book. It is really well written with lots of practical information - plus great pictures. I really recommend it to anyone touring London.
2,Pretty useless,I bought this battery as a replacement/backup for the battery included in my new Nokia 6126 from AT&T. The one shipped with my new phone lasts approximately 12 hours with about 1 hour of talktime before requiring recharging. WELL the one I bought on Amazon is exactly the same. As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
1,Nokia battery,Do not buy it! It's waste of money. It's a junk. I got it for my husband's cell because his other Nokia battery that came with the phone was not good. But... what a dissapointment. It had a very short life just like his other one.
1,DISAPPOINTED,I can not rate an item i did not receive or use.THE BATTERIES NEVER MADE IT TO ME EVEN AFTER THE MONEY WAS TAKEN FROM MY ACCOUNT AND I HAD WRITTEN TO SAY MY ORDER DID NOT GET TO ME.I have placed order with Amazon and they were delivered.
1,Not a real OEM battery,the nokia bl-4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 04060407030000420323
3,cell phone battery,Batteries arrived in good shape. Not sure they were 100% new. The battery life does not appear to be much more improved than the replacements.
1,Nice recorder... Sony formatted files not helpful,"The recordered has some nice features, like being able to select ""folders"" that you want to record the sessions into. However, the sound is recordered in a proprietary sony format. You need to download software to make Media Player play it. What makes things really annoying is there is no clean method by which you can save it into a ""normal"" format for sharing with other people. Why on earth didn't Sony use WAV or MP3 format is beyond my comprehension.Recording quality is decent when you are within 6 feet of a person and have the recorder in plain view. However, if you are further away and want to keep the discrete (like in your pocket) the sound quality is terrible."
1,"Exclusive, not Mac compatible, Sony failed","Proprietary format and although it is a FAT16 flash drive when plugged into a PC, for some reason it cannot be seen on a Mac. Sony exclusivity is a big mistake. Don't buy this -- it will just be a big hassle trying to read, process, share the files. (You might smash it with a sledge hammer and send to sony with a note.)The buttons, layout, etc are nice -- typical of Sony -- and solid, well made, although the unit is big by current standards. 1 AAA battery.As an external drive (""storange device""), it is useless as it is not Mac compatible."
2,Save your money,"I was excited about some of the features of this product, along with the price for what's offered. (Said features stopped me from giving this a 1-star rating.) Unfortunately, the sound quality is HORRIBLE compared to others I've heard, many of which are less expensive. And the format of the created file isn't very versatile either. Such a shame... Save your money for a different product. Sony, what's up?"
1,Sound quality extremely bad compared to competition,"I bought this recorder 10 months ago. Afterwards I have had many devices with voice recording ability and this is my ranking of the sound quality.1. edirol r-9 field recorder2. iriver T-10 mp3 player3. Olympus ws-320 voice recorder4. Sony icdu 60 voice recorderThe sony recorder is actually very bad compared to the other devices, also the iriver mp3 player that is about the same size. The sound quality is amazingly bad and is a misuse of the sony name."
1,what a POS,"I have never bought a bad Sony product until now. This is an embarassment to Sony - The deveopment team for this POS should be assigned to a ball bearing factory. The speaker has no resolution, so there is no quick play back capability and the overall interface is cumbersome at best. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Enchanting and educational,"My husband and I listened to this audio tour while on a road-trip. The commentary was informative and pleasant, the music very soothing. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with local people. The entire experience makes us want to visit Kashi soon.Shyamala"
5,Great!,"First, the other person with the ""cruelty"" review is foolish and silly. Come on. Get real. Go protest against things that matter, eh? Like stopping the killing of babycows for veal. ;)This stuff made my skin is soft and smooth. I love burt's bees!"
3,"useful, if extremely basic, intro to modern media","This is a good book about the evolution of the media, written at the undergraduate or even high school level. The core idea is that there is a potential serious conflict between the necessity to make a profit and the mission of news providers to seek the public good, the truth, etc. This is a worthy question to ask, particularly in a semi-textbook, and the author comes down in favor of regulation and independence from the whims of owners, e.g. Rupert Murdoch.There are 4 trends: 1) growth via M&A; of media corporations; 2) integration of different kinds of media in some companies, e.g. print, TV, internet; 3) globalization of offerings; 4) concentration of ownership. The rest is historical detail.I can't say that I learned all that much, but this is a useful resource, presented systematically. Recommended."
4,Great read for students and all interested in media and the media industry.,"I purchased this text as part of my required reading for a graduate course. The text is clear, concise,and provides real world examples of how the media indsutry has changed and continues to change. I'm almost mid way through the semester and I find that this book provides a clear analysis of both the media indsutry from an economic standpoint and with the social and theoretical material. I'm not going to sell this book back."
5,A Great Gift for Girls!,"I gave this book to my little cousin, who at five is already a budding makeup artist. Her parents tell me they haven't been able to pry it away from her since! Obviously, this is the kind of book any young girl would love. The illustrations are darling, and the text is quite charming--and also age-appropriate. A real find!"
5,Excellent condition!,"This book was in just incredible condition when I received it. It came in a timely manner (within 4 days) and I am very pleased, overall! Thank you!"
2,somewhat disappointed,"I bought this CD after hearing one of the songs at a funciton that I attended and was really moved by the song. However, after recieving the CD, it was a different version than the original one I heard. That was very disappointing to me. The CD overall is only OK-I would not have purchased it if I had heard it prior to my purchase."
1,What the...,This might be just another of the well paid efforts of the Venezuelan Goverment to improve its international image with the nation's taxpayers money. This country is on the verge of civil war thanks to its communist and authoritarian tendencies. Anyone who likes dictatorship should back this holdum we have as a president.
2,"Decent, but has facts wrong","This video is about 50 minutes long. The first 5 minutes cover the history of the automobile before covering the Corvette. It does not go too deeply into detail on any of the models, and some of the information presented is wrong. For example, when covering the C4 corvette, it talks about how an auto club in France loves the Corvette and they have a 1983 that they drive around. The only 1983 in existence is in a museum in Bowling Green. Then, it talks about the custom paint job on a 1982, when the car is obviously a C4. Because of these errors, I questioned all of the information presented. They seem to stray away from the subject and then back onto it. It's worth a few bucks, but no more..."
3,Ok Dvd..,I am a Corvette Buff..So.. of course Some of the footage there was already available from a VHS i have called Corvette 1988.. that vhs had some mistakes as well..and so does this dvd. The only update being a different announcer and some facts left out. and of course the C5. (its up to 1998) Its also basically the same America's Favorite Sports Car VHS 1998 Corvette(RED COVER). Nonetheless.. Cheap and Ok Dvd.
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I bought these castanets for a flamenco class and am very disappointed. The castanet string included with these is an ineffective synthetic which does NOT work all and is not recommended for playing.I have to buy a new pair, and the return policy of the seller is ridiculous. Do NOT NOT NOT buy these castanets. They are terrible and unplayable.Having said that, I think these were the cheapest ones I saw advertised, so once again I learn the hard way that ""You get what you pay for."""
1,Couldn't even use them,"I'm a flamenco dancer and use castanets a lot. I throught I could use these temporarily before I got the good (and expensive) ones, but it's better to just save up for a good pair. I couldn't even use them, and eventually I just tossed them."
5,Outstanding photo album,This is a very good photo album on the Battle of the Bulge. There are various pics of both German and American soldiers during this epic battle that helped define the outcome of the war. This is one of the best photo albums I have viewed on this particular subject and it is easy to handle and navigate. These are some outstanding photos and they are well captioned. Anyone interested in the Battle of the Bulge should own this book.
2,Not much of a read,"I had a number of problems with this book. The good parts were that it contained much information on the regulation of gifts in a small community over a certain period of time. This is the kind of contextualization that really should be apllied to any anthropological work. Unfortunately, an eye towards the readers is something I also believe should be included. Specifically, I don't think there should be much line between literature and science in a field that cannot possibly hope to perform like a physical science. Trying to gauge human interaction on a scale does not work in my opinion. Since that's what this book attempts to do, it bugs me. As a piece of anthropology concerning gift giving in rural China, it is actually quite good. But only if that's your bag."
5,Radikal Techno,"Track: Komodo - Mauro Picotto I heard this song at bestbuy and realized once I heard it i had to have it!!!! i went to one of the salesman to ask where it was located... When I did, I realized there was a line of people behind me requesting the same song because they also heard it on the intercom. Of coarse the geniuses at best buy did not know where the song was in their own store. So I bought it through Amazon ... . The CD is a hit... If you like trance and eclub music than this is for you.P.S. TO ALL THE RECORD COMPANIES... AFTER I HEARD THE SONG I WENT HOME AND DOWNLOADED THE SONG ..., THEN I BOUGHT THE CD."
2,Poor selection.,"I was referred to this product by amazon when I purchased a Darude CD. I bought it because I had a gif certificate and needed to blow some of it. THe techno is not exciting and there are a lot of lyrics, which I am not usually a fan of. If you like pure techno and house, go for somethign else."
3,Schizoid Dimension needs a little more schizoid and more dimension,"I read over other reviews of this tribute album. I feared the worst upon spinning my copy. I'm a ""Crimhead"" but I don't find it objectionable when others attempt their takes of Crimson originals-- slavish, good, bad or indifferent. I find it interesting to listen to someone else's attempt at a familiar piece. Of course experiencing a cover taking the original to new heights and directions is a delight. This is a tall order for much if not all of Crimson's work. While I don't think that the majority of the cuts on this album altered King Crimson's sonic map, I found even the more slavish takes worth listening to. I liked the version of Neil and Jack and ME; I talk to the Wind; Exiles, A Sailors Tale. 3-1/2 stars-- maybe 4."
2,Average Tribute Album,"Ok stuff. But doesn't stand up for itself by itself. Similar to the ELP tribute album - the bands are a notch below the original in spirit and skills. Perhaps that's deliberate? Get it if you're a diehard - else just wait until it appears in a bargain bin. Better to spend the bucks on the new released master of Album #1 (In the Court of the Crimson King) - can really hear the quality remastering job done by Fripp. But alas, Moonchild is still on the album with it's Sinfield-ish Elmo-Sings-Hippie lyrics."
1,Never buy a tribute album,"I just goes to show... never buy a tribute album. I heard nothing but second rate stuff. Oh, don't be fooled when you see Brand X on this. Brand X in fact is a band with very talented musicians and has been around the block quite a few times.... doesn't mean they can capture what Crimson did. It also doesn't mean they will play what you really want to hear... King Crimson. The One and only... CRIMSON."
3,"NOT AN ACTION MOVIE, IT'S A COURTROOM DRAMA/SUSPENSE FILM","DON'T BE MISLEAD BY THE COVER FOR THIS MOVIE. THERE'S LITTLE ACTION TO BE SEEN IN THIS MOVIE. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THREE YOUNG BOYS WHO COMMIT A DOUBLE RAPE AND ASSAULT WITH INTENTION TO KILL. NOW, THEIR CASE IS BEING PLEAD BY AN UNDEFEATED ATTORNEY [ERIK ESTRADA, IN ONE OF HIS BETTER PERFORMANCES] WHO'S KNOWN FOR HELPING GUILTY CRIMINALS AVOID GOING TO JAIL. BUT, HIS EX-WIFE IS THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WHO'S ALSO UNDEFEATED IN THE COURTROOM. SO, WHO WILL WIN THE CASE? AND WILL THESE THREE BOYS GO TO JAIL FOR WHAT THEY DID? WELL, YOU'LL WANT TO FIND OUT WHEN YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE, WHICH HAS SOME DECENT ACTING AND A SUPRISINGLY DECENT STORYLINE."
5,Excellent movie about real happenings,"This movie has some great acting in it andlots of action in that the three young menwho did the dirty deeds make it miserableon all involvedvery moving and shows how real life couldbe harmful to those involved including thethree young menErik Estrada, Joey Travolta, Kathrin Lautnerwere great in this moviewas good to see Eric Estrada acting againrecommend this movie to all who like a great storychfancierfancier of fine movies"
1,"Poor User Interface, Poor Quality","Unfortunately, this phone was a complete waste. Mine worked as intended for just about two months, and the died completely.Even when it was working, using it was frustrating. The user interface is the most counter intuitive one I've ever come across on a cordless phone. Even dialing can be frustrating. For example, every other phone I've seen allows you to dial the number _before OR after_ pressing the Talk button. This phone requires you to press the talk button before beginning to dial. Consequently, everyone who picks up this phone ends up confused.Anyway, this phone was a complete waste of money. Buy at your own risk."
1,surprise,"Specting a discography. a confuse documentary instead. old images, scattered songs. the informations are not in good sequence. maybe for very well informed fans."
5,Great clips show evolution of Talking Heads,"As a long time Talking Heads fan, I thought this collection did a great job of showing the growth of the band as performers in the late 70s and early 80s. You can see David Byrne turn his awkwardness into his own quirky kind of performance piece. You can see Tina Weymouth grow from musical skills that were merely adequate to becoming a real artist on the bass and keyboard. And, the additional interviews give some great insights into the band's philosophy. Finally, just seeing Talking Heads interviewed by Dick Clark and performing on American Bandstand was worth the purchase price."
5,A book for all the hopless romantics out there.,"One of the best books I have ever read. A great love story for the romantic in all of us. Chronicals the ups and downs of a relationship on the sly with a love that would last a lifetime. Very sad, yet a love we all wish we could find. I couldn't put it down."
3,Very intriguing.,It was filled with great information about Katharine and Spencer - seperately and together. It is unbelievable that they existed in a 26 year relationship and nobody talked about it until Katharine started talking about it herself. Amazing.
2,Entertaining reading but lots of inaccuracies.,"This is an entertaining book but for those who have read previous biographies of these two stars, they will notice that several pictures are labeled wrong and some of the information is inaccurate."
4,It was actually pretty interesting,"I ""found"" this book by accident. I thought I would get bored with it, but it turned out to be pretty good. It's amazing how times have changed. Now adays, I would think Spencer would have divorced Louise and taken ""his Kath"" as his wife instead of living with her ""in secret"" for some 25+ years. It's sad, but then there are fun parts. Katherine is a women way ahead of time, but still very much in love with her ""Spensuh"". The book is not bad, easy reading."
4,Star-Crossed Lovers,"This novel opened up a world that I knew nothing about. The world that only Katharine & Spencer lived in, together... I've been a huge fan of the acting duo for years. Now I feel like I almost know them. Reading this book is like taking a quick peek behind the scenes. It gives details into their lives prior to their initial meeting. Then continues describing how they had to sneak around in order to keep their affair out of the papers. This novel is heartwarming & also tragic. I loved it. If you're a romantic, you'll love it, too."
2,Exiled from Crimson collections,"Hackneyed mix of new age, progressive rock, and metal largely misses the mark of this violinist's ex-Crimson contributions, working best in short Fripp cameo guitar work and hardly letting listeners remember with a barrage of high-minded jams and vocal embarrassments."
3,Using in Afghanistan,"Let's start with the good, gloves fit very nice. The double velcro straps are awesome and fit very nicely. The padding for the knuckles sits right where it supposed to. The material used to make these gloves is very soft and flexible from the start. Now the bad, all the finger lengths are perfect except for the thumb. Maybe I have big thumbs but I have 3 other pairs of gloves and don't have any issues. The thumb length on these gloves is really small. My thumbs come right to the tip and feel like there being pressed on the whole time. The area between the index finger and thumb is stretched to the max and looks like it's going to tear. I've used these glove for multiple things like building a tent, lifting some weights, and maintenance on Helos. These gloves are not made for cold weather but good gloves over all. The reason for the 3 stars is the poor fit on the thumbs and a little pricey."
5,A masterpiece!,Dr. Troy's work is a magnificent treatise that takes the art of presidential scholarship to a new level. He is the new Neustadt of our age.
4,JUNG IS A MUST BUY,ALL N ALL JUNG IS A ENTERTAINING FILM.MITHUN AND AJAY DEVGAN ARE SUPERB IN HERE.BUY IT.
2,Not for 2 toddlers!,I bought this stroller for my 2 1/2 year old twin boys who have outgrown their Graco DuoGlider. My son who sat on the back jump seat looked somewhat comfortable but there is no back/head rest. My son who sat in the front seat was very uncomfortable! His feet kept touching the wheels and the seat is VERY shallow! I would only recommend this stroller for short rides and the front seat only for infants.
5,Very happy with purchase,"I just recieved my Joovy and after putting it together myself with no help from hubby I tested it out with my 2 and 4 year old girls. They absolutely loved it! I love it as well it is light and very easy to push them both, easy to stear. I am fine with the basket placement and size. I do wish it had a cupholder but I just plan on ordering one.I bought the apple green and the color is very nice!We do a lot of zoo, seaworld, airshow type outings and this will be perfect because although my oldest is 4 she still needs to hitch a ride once in a while even on the many walks we take.I think that bad reviews on here are people just being way too picky it really is a wonderful product!!!!"
3,Great stroller but don't try and fold it,I bought this stroller for my 1 month old and 3 1/2 year old. My 3 1/2 year old fell in love with it in the store so we assembled it there and then but when we went to put it in the trunk of our fullsized car it did not fit the the attachment on for the care seat. I had to return it to the store and it took 2 young men 10 minutes to get it off there is no way I could do that in a parking lot with 2 childen. Otherwise for the 10 minutes we owned it seemed great.
1,Dont like it.,"The wheels lock when I put it into my SUV and its hard to get the stroller in. When I get it out of the trunk and lay it on the ground, the food tray is directly on the ground and I have a hard time trying not to let that happen. The pockets in the infant seat are way too small. Its very hard to push when both kids are in it. The baby doesnt seem to confortable when she falls asleep. My toddler seems to like it, but I honestly wish I never purchased it. I wish I hadn't given away my Graco stroller."
3,Light weight and easy to fold,"Very convinience to carry everywhere, folds very easy, back sit needs better adjusment to avoid to hit the back of the fron sit specially when using the carier for small baby."
1,Max height problem,I soon as I saw this stroller I fell in love with it. I have 2 kids. My son is 3 and my daughter is 1. I have a Graco Duo Glider and my son does not always like to ride it anymore he prefers to walk. So this would have been perfect for when he gets tired of walking. The only problem is that the max height for standing child is 40 inches. My son is already 41 inches. I have read reviews with people saying they put there 4 year old in them. Maybe my son is tall for his age?
5,Love this stroller,"I bought this stroller to accommodate my 3 year old as well as our new born. It has been a huge help, it is easy to open and close, while holding one baby in one arm as well as a diaper bag. The seat does not recline that much but kids fall asleep in the oddest places anyway. The backseat also has limited room for sitting the child in the back will have to sit very upright. My daughter did not mind it at all, and now she is four and still has no problem with it. She enjoys being able to see her sister in front of her."
1,Don't buy it,"- It's a heavy stroller and doesn't fold up easy. The worst thing that your toddler will not fit in the rear seat, my 3 years old daughter had to bend forward all the time when she sat down."
4,Great for theme parks!,"I bought this stroller because I have a 5 and 3 y/o and a baby on the way. We were planning a trip to Disney and I thought this would make our trip a lot easier, and it did! Great investment even if I only had bought it for the trip. I have not used it as an infant carrier yet, but it was great for the toddlers!Bad part is that the mesh underneath is where I stored all of our water bottles (about 7)for day 1 at Disney, by the evening the snap on the mesh would not stay closed and was dragging along the ground. I was able to improvise a solution to keep it up for day 2, but definitely not ideal for even remotely heavy storage."
4,nice,wish they were not too cheep to put in the bottle holder in with the total package or that the back seat didn't slide back and forth between a range of four to five inches... otherwise like a lot. Fantastic buy and would recommend to a friend!
4,Great stroller,"I used this stroller for the first time this past weekend in Chicago with my 3 1/2 year old and 4 1/2 month old. Folded down easily, lightweight, and strolled smoothly. When front seat is reclined it takes away from room in the back for the older child. Only problem is that older child would often drag feet, otherwise worked well and is a lot less bulky than a double side by side stroller.Love the green apple color!"
5,Love this stroller!,"Very durable and sturdy, and perfect for carting around my 3 year old and infant. It is a bit big when folded up, but that is to be expected with a stroller for two. Highly recommended!!"
4,Good fot two!,"This sroller is great. It is easy to push and turns easily in small spots. My only concern is that there isn't a lot of head room for the child sitting in the back, when you are using the car seat attachment (and a car seat) up front."
5,Joovy Caboose Stand on Tandem Stroller rocks!,We previously borrowed this stroller from a friend for a trip to chicago with two grandkids... It was fabulous for the airport and the zoo... Plenty of space for the two of them with a little storage too.
4,Quality tandem stroller,"We bought this stroller for our 2 year old and newborn. Right now we use the car seat for our infant and our 2 year old sits in the back. I was surprised that my toddler enjoys sitting in the back facing us. I was worried he might want to face forward to see all the action. The stroller steers/handles well and is well made. There are a few reasons I gave it 4 stars - 1) the toddler seat in the back can slide back so that the toddler's back is running into the car seat; 2) the canopy is low for use with the car seat - if it's intended to provide coverage over the baby, it doesn't quite accomplish that; and 3) the stroller is heavy and awkward to get into the car - I know, I know... I didn't purchase the Ultralight but feel it's still worth mentioning. Overall this is a nice stroller and solid and at $147 (what I paid in Nov 08) I'd definitely buy it again."
4,Great mobility with this stroller!,"I had a Graco Duoglider, and found that it was difficult to manuever when shopping. I saw someone with the Joovy Caboose at the mall, and thought it was worth a try. It is wonderful! My 2.5 year old loves being able to stand or sit. It is much easier to fold and to take in & out of the car than the Duoglider was. It is also much easier to steer in general (my husband said he felt like he was driving a BMW), but especially in tight spaces, like clothing stores and fitting rooms. There are 2 cons to the Caboose:#1 is that it has much less storage space than the Duoglider, so a traditional diaper bag doesn't fit well, and doesn't leave room for much else. #2 is that your toddler/preschooler can put his/her feet on the wheels or even on the ground when sitting on the bench, so you do have to instruct them about keeping their feet on the platform. Overall, I am really happy with this purchase!"
2,Poorly designed,"I just tried this stoller in the store and I have to say I was very disappointed. The concept is great, but they still have some work to do. The seat in back for the older child slides back and forth. Also, there really isnt much room to sit comfortably. My3 year old daughter, who is little and only weighs 26 lbs, didn't have much room. She had to lean forward when she was sitting. I asked her if she liked it and she said no, she wanted out. Also, who wants to sit facing backwards. All she has to look at is me!It really wasn't much better in the standing position either. Even though I know she really might not want to use it that often I would rather pay the same money and get the Graco double stoller. At least then when she wants to sit she can do so comfortably. When I put her in the Graco double stoller, she did not want to get out. She asked me to please take her for a ride around the store."
1,No napping in this stroller.,"My kids are 32 months apart and this stroller did not work well for us. My 2 year old hated sitting in the back seat. The front seat poked her in the back when the car seat was in it, she hated riding backwards and she had no where to nap if she was tired...running errands was awful!! The carseat converter was hard to take on and off (I pinched my fingers all the time). The front seat hardly reclines and is not soft at all...which means no napping in this stroller! It is bulky and heavy. I sold it after 6 months and bought the maclaren twin triumph stroller (which I love)."
3,"OK Stroller, but inconvenient","Stroller is OK, not bad, but not great either.so the good:very nice looking in pictures and live as well, can stroll 2 kids, one sitting, other sitting or standing.the bad:very heavy,wobbly when pushedwheels scrapingthe ugly:I don't know who and how designed this product, but weight distribution is terrible! if only one child sits in front seat, stroller rolls very much into pavement decline/incline direction. i.e. on the road where edges are slightly declined stroller just does not go straight, chooses to roll towards edges instead. due to this it's very hard to push and maintain it not to roll off the sidewalk or not bump to curb (when sidewalk is not available and you stroll on the road). however that is not the case when second child stands or sits...I have not tried other sit'n'go-s so I would highly recommend just to stop by to any local shop try it, see if you like and if it fits your needs; then back to amazon, cause nobody beats their prices 99.9% of the time."
1,"Good stroller, bad company service","On my first use, the stroller restraining strap stitching started to unravel. This curtailed the use of the back portion of the stroller during the remainder of the trip (safety issue). So, I proceeded to called the company about the possible exchange of the stroller. The warranty on the back of the instructions says ""satisfaction guaranteed"". Apparently this is a small time operation because the same person handles all the customer service inquiries. The person is insistent on having everything repaired regardless what the warranty says. They don't care who repairs the stroller stitching. They referred me to a shoe repair shop they never dealt with before. Apparently satisfaction guaranteed means repair at all costs even when you get a stroller with poor workmanship. It says something about the company. I would never buy a Joovy. Imagine what kind of service you get once you are out of warranty. Beware."
2,Major Design Flaws,"This is a great concept for an innovative stroller. I love that my [...] old can fit in the same stroller with out dragging out the double stroller. However, after using this stroller for 3 months, I returned it. There are several design flaws that were driving me crazy. First off, the front footrest was horrible. It has a flip-up design that does not allow my son's legs to rest on anything when it was in the down position. The footrest had to either be up at all times or my child's feet would flop over because there is no room for them. In addition, the front seat is very shallow and my son needed to be belted at all times or he would slide right out. Also, the tray is very difficult to remove and the stroller didn't break-down with ease (it was stuck opened several occasions). So, therefore I returned it and found another brand (same style) with out any of the flaws."
1,NIGHTMARE!!!!,"Where do I start???? My 3 and 5 year old complained the whole time in it. Front foot rest too short, front seats can not recline when my daughter is in the back, Front tray does not come off easily, storage hard to get to, Stay away!!!! Sending back...."
4,almost perfect,if this stroller came with a cup holder I would have given it 5 stars... I dont want to buy extra pieces - it should come with it!
2,it's ok,"this item is ok, i was so excited after purchasing it, then when i received it i thought it was way too heavy, the description is that it's light but in fact it is the opposite. it's very heavy and takes up a lot of room. i read that it was convenient and light and fits very well, but in truth it doesn't. it takes up too much room and is too heavy to tag around. it's comfortable for my daughter and son but not what i expected."
5,this thing saved my life,"okay, who isn't on the quest for the perfect stroller... this may be close- esp for the price. i have two kids who aren't crazy about the stroller- they are 19 months apart- currently almost 1.5 and 3 yrs. we have a bob and a double bob- both of which are perfect for the terrain where we live and the running we like to do. however, to travel with either of those strollers is usually really inconvienent. the joovy rocks. it folds up super flat and latches so its easy to pick up and put in your car. the kids love it- my son can sit up and eat snacks the whole time, and my daughter loves the freedom to jump in and out when she feels like it. its easy to manevur and super narrow so i don't feel akward in stores or when i go downtown. also, the price is great- with amazons free shipping - i got in 2 days! i searched the internet and this was the best price i found. i love the joovy and you will too!"
1,Not worth the money,I got this stroller as a gift along with the baby trend sit and stand. When I put them both together it was clear which one was the better stroller. The Joovy leaves very little room for the toddler to sit once the car seat is in place. However the sit and stand has plenty of room along with cup holders for the parent and child as the child gets older. Even the person at babies r us said he returned is because of the same problem. I live in the city and need something that isn't as big as a double stroller.
5,Wonderful solution for a tired toddler!,"I purchased this stroller a few weeks ago when my three year old started preschool. We walk to and from each day and his little legs would get tired on the walk. Now he is so excited to go because he can walk, stand, or sit in his ""big boy seat"" on the stroller. His little sister rides up front and loves to see big bro behind her. She enjoys talking to him in her babble as we stroll. This stroller folds flatter than most standard strollers I've seen. Its really durable, wonderfully made, and has a nice tall handle that even their 6'5"" Daddy doesn't have to bend to use! Huge plus for us!!"
4,I love Joovy,"This is my second Joovy, we already have the Kooper but needed this double when baby girl came along. It moves great and folds down very flat. The easy fold to close it is nice too. I wish it had an area for hot beverages like some other double stand on strollers, but that's not a huge deal. My son loves sitting on the back, and acts like it's more of a ""ride"" for him, than a stroller, he gets on and off with ease and it's great for not having to lift him in and out of a seat."
2,"Hmmm, not so satisfying....","I got this item thinking that it was the best thing on the market. while it can be nice for short jaunts, it is not a good choice for long days at the zoo or other amusement park. the basket area is too small, we wound up having to tie things to the sides to keep them on. If the baby carrier is in the front, the child in back sits awkwardly. So we set the baby carrier on the back (somehow), but this was an unsafe way (thank goodness the cart didn't get away from us, and you can't use the canopy if the baby carrier is in the front. Additionally, I don't like that there isn't a real seat for the child in back. Again, this is a great stroller for short trips, but when your two year old gets tired...they are not going to be able to sit comfortbly in the jump seat. I am going to shelve this stroller and purchase a sit and stand deluxe. The baskets are bigger, there is the second seat option for the child in back, and I think overall...a better stroller."
1,I really hate this stroller,This is a great stroller for 1 child but not for 2It was impossible for my 2 year old to sit or stand in the back with my 1 month old riding in the front which I thought was the entire point of this strollerIt is only a good buy if both of your children are old enough to ride in the seats only the infant carrier part is completely useless !!!
1,"if you want to ruin your back, buy this stroller","I have had this stroller for 3 years. It is heavy and ver hard to manuever once our children passed a year old. For two years I have been highly annoyed at having to fight with my stroller everyday. Now in year 3 I am having serious back issues - which I attribute largely to this stroller. Save your back and a lot of chiropractic $$$. If you plan on doing a lot of walking or will be putting this stroller in/out of your trunk, buy yourself a good stroller that is easy to push and light enough to lift."
4,we like it,"as stated in previous reviews, the brakes are placed in an inconvenient spot such that my older children engage them while standing on the platform....I also wanted to add for the people who said that the bench slides, it does in fact snap in place....there are two snap buttons under the bench to secure it in place, solving the problem of the bench sliding. Hope that helps!!"
3,Not the greatest for big toddlers,Bought this for my nanny so she could take her 4 year old and my 2 year old to more outdoor events; my son is a very tall 2 year old and the front of this stroller doesn’t recline well or adjust back so you can give the front passenger more room. I don’t recommend this stroller at all if you have bigger toddlers.
2,Not quite,"The good things: the price, the stand on platform, steering, the length. The bad: the storage underneath is TINY and not accessible at all, to use a car seat in the front you have to use an adapter which does not fold up with the rest, and the seat for the older child moves (which might be a plus for someone, I don't know, but my daughter was sliding all around knocking her head into the car seat).I drove it around and tried to use it for all of an hour before packing it back up and returning it for the new Baby Trend."
2,"Great Idea, poor design.","I bought this stroller because I found it on sale for almost the same price as a ride on board attachment for my stroller that I already have. I ended up selling it 2 weeks later. My 4 year old and 7 year old did like the back seat..but did not fit under the canopy. My 3 year old fit in the front seat..but the tray does not come off easily so I had to lift him in and out..and that gets old fast!! The basket is nice, and the fabric is high quality, but I went back to my bob revolution duallie and used the money from selling this to just buy the adapter to the duallie that I am very happy with."
3,A Big Fat OK,"This stroller, I am hoping, will ease my problems of my 3 year old refusing to ride in a stroller and running off in every mall and sidewalk around. When it arrived, it was super easy to assemble. However, one of the back tires was split and I had to call customer service for a replacement. The hood is a bit cumbersome. Overall it is an OK stroller, but I would not recommend it to others ONLY because of my split tire. What a headache!"
3,Pretty Big - Thought it Would Be Smaller,"This looks like it will be a good stroller (just pulled it out of the box) but I just wanted to point out to readers that this is as big as a tandem double stroller. I thought it was going to be closer to the length of a single stroller with a little stand on the back for my older child but it is really quite large and I wonder if I wouldn't have been better off with a regular tandem stroller - I'm not planning on returning it and I have no complaints - other than it's not quite what I thought it was (which I admit I could have figured out if I had just compared the dimensions with other doubles before buying). So, my 3 star review is simply because I had in my mind something different so I'm not as excited about it as I thought I would be but for someone who is fine with something on the big side I suspect you'll love it."
2,Too small for an infant seat and a toddler,"I bought this stroller in March just before the birth of our little one. My older daughter has just turned three and is pretty small for her age. When we finally put the stroller together to use we realized that with the infant seat attached, there is no room for our daughter to sit or stand (which is the purpose of the stroller am I wrong?) The basket is almost inaccessible once the little ones are using the stroller. I might hold onto it for use once my newbie is old enough to sit up on her own, but really seems WAY too small for two kiddos."
4,The perfect solution!,"After lugging around the 40 pound Eddie Bauer all terrain double stroller, this was a god send! Its very light, my 2 year old loves to sit or stand in the back. My 1 1/2 year old loves to sit in the front with plenty of room for her toys on the tray. If you have a toddler and an infant this is the stroller for you. There are only 2 problems with this stroller. 1) No parent organizer tray. But there are mesh pockets on the back of the seat. Joovy is also supposed to be coming out with a tray very soon. 2) The basket is a little hard to use with a child sitting in the rear seat.All in all, this is a great stroller. If anything the two above mentioned problems has taught me how to travel lightly."
4,So far so good,I am loving this stroller so far. Very easy to open and close. Only complaint is that is is hard for my toddler to sit on the seat when I have my infant in the car seat in the front. But when he is out of the car seat it is going to be perfect for the both of them!
4,Great Stroller for the money,"My husband calls me a stroller addict! The Caboose makes the 5th stroller for us and I really like it! I got this one for as it's perfect quick trips to the mall or running errands. It's to open and close, not overly heavy. My one major complaint...the back seat slides back and forth while my little one is sitting. It would be great if it had a lock to keep in place."
2,"Great idea, but it not quite there yet","I tested this stroller in the store with my 2.5yr old son and infant daughter. The stroller is nice and light for a double, however it has one major problem.In order for an infant seat to snap in the front, the front seat needs to be reclined all the way. If the front seat is reclined, there is only standing room in the back for a toddler. My son loved riding around the store sitting and standing. I was extremely disappointed when I realized he wasn't able to sit in order for his sister to ride in the stroller too!"
2,Only good for small kids and on flat surfaces.,"We bought this stroller for the Summer knowing we would be out for long periods of time and my older children would eventually get tired of walking. Very quickly we found that we were on the grass a lot visiting parks, festivals and fairs etc. This stroller performs very poorly in these conditions, is hard to push and we can only push one child, our 2year old, in these conditions. Even on flat surfaces it is hard to push with 2 children, our 2 and 4 year old, in the stroller. I love the concept, but does not live up to my expectations."
3,Too heavy,"This stroller weighs about 30lbs empty. Once I got my 3 year old and her under 1 year old brother into it, I was pushing almost 90lbs. Way too heavy! And also a bit bulky to store, though that may be true of any double stroller. I never tried any other sit and stand strollers, so perhaps this is just a problem with all sit and stands, but I only used it maybe 3 times and then I got rid of it in favor of a used Phil and Ted Sport stroller with doubles kit, which is much lighter and easier to use. I actually bought it used for the same price this Joovy stroller is listed at, so for the same money I got a much more functional stroller that can be used either as a single stroller or a double."
2,Hope you have muscles!,"This stroller moves and handles ok, but man is it heavy!! Folding it is quite large and barely fits in my crossover SUV trunk. We are using the infant car attachment and it won't fit in my trunk unless i detach that part. The sit-on part is pretty teeny when the front seat is reclined, which is how it has to be when using the infant seat. I would not recommend this sroller."
3,White gloves are hard to get wrong,"They were meant for a costume and came late. White gloves are white gloves. You're not going to do anything heavy duty with them, they're usually just for looks, and that they cover."
5,white gloves,"Love them - they are great with my clown outfit. Thanks for the addition to my clowning around, I will use them often. Thanks"
2,Boring and dated,This book is simply a list of things you can do to promote your salon. It is hard to read and boring. Don't waste your money on this book.
3,Maybe needs updating,"Bought this as a gift for one of the owners of the salon I go to. She and two others had just opened their first salon, but were experienced in the beauty industry. I thought many of the ideas in the book were interesting since I have marketing experience, but I don't think the salon owners still get the value of marketing. I would suggest the author offer an update, since a lot has changed with social media, texting, web sites, etc. in the past 6 years."
1,outdated,I wish I would have looked at the date it was published. The information is outdated and obsolete. I was looking for more current marketing strategies using the web.
3,It's a pretty cool collection,"48 songs, for like $20 , is not a bad deal. Not the greatest mix of live and studio performances though. Skinhead Girl is a real standout dance tune."
2,"Mediocre and Flat, Thought Not Without Merits","Glad to see that the awfully incestuous publishing industry can you fool sometimes, but not all of the time... This writer has been hyped to death and death itself is what this collection of mediocre, flat short stories amount to: death of the imagination, of originality and plausibility in prose. However, the writer isn't without talent and, perhaps, if she'd been given room to develop instead of taken for publicity as a 'type' and hyped to the height of skyscrapers, then maybe she'd been able to produce something worth reading. Sadly, this book isn't."
1,Failed to spark my interest...,"I picked up this short-story collection because someone had gushed about how wonderful it was. However, I was not able to get into any of the stories. The situations failed to spark my interest and the author's voice did not capture me the way other short-story writers have enthralled me. The only story I was able to finish was ""The Tutor."" There was nothing special about the story, but it was the only one out of the five stories I was able to read from beginning to end without wanting to close the book and never open it again. This does not mean that Lucky Girls is a bad collection -- I was simply unable to get into it. And judging by some of the reviews below I was not the only one who had trouble enjoying it."
2,You can do better for your money,"Simply put, this book is fine. It won't stay with you, however, nor will you find it particularly moving while you're reading it. I mean--well, it's fine. And that's not exactly what I look for in a book, and I doubt you do either. If you're interested, my advice is wait for the paperback."
1,Pretentious and dull,It's funny everyone keeps talking about the hype I hadn't heard any of it--have I been living on a different planet or something?--but I did think this book had an attractive cover and I generally like short fiction so I gave it a go. Well it failed to engage me in any significant way. The narrators and characters are completely stock and the writing is self-conscious and pretentious and precious. For short fiction I recommend Lorrie Moore.
1,It was a waste of my time,"I am not at all pleased to give bad reviews but I agree with winfieldscott to the fullest. At the end of each story I was left wondering...what the heck was that story about? So I would actually sit down and read the story again, thinking that I hadnt caught the *boom* I thought maybe it was so subtle, in a word or single sentence...disappointingly there was never any *boom* just a whole lot of ""what the..."" It took twice the time to read with no pay off. Perhaps even if her writing was beautiful I feel I couldve overlooked the poor story lines. The writing was not beautiful, but confusing and rather weak. I am so sorely disapointed. I couldve used my 14 bucks to buy underwear or something."
2,"merely ""okay""","This book presents an interesting dilemna--not good enough to be something memorable, but not bad enough to be a complete train wreck. The author has clearly spent time researching and revising. Although meticulous, her writing is not strong enough to carry this book without the ""spark"" of something like a plot, deeper insight, more humor, etc.These stories are all about expat, young, upperclass women living in Asia. I'm amazed by how stories set in the most exotic (At least from the perspective of a middle class person living in the US) places can be described in such an uninteresting manner.Many reviewers seem angry that this book was offered a $500,000 advance, when it of such an average, writer's workshop quality. These reviewers should remember to review novels solely on their merits, not over any bitterness or anger towards the author. For a truly interesting and well written novel about expat women, read ""Interesting Women"" by Andrea Lee."
1,Stands up in comparison??,"Lucky Girls stories stand up in comparison to Interpreter of Maladies? You must be smoking whatever the author of this awful book was. I dont have anything to gain by giving a bad review. I just did not enjoy this book. The characters were not likeable, the stories were not exciting, some didnt even make sense. To compare Lucky Girls to Interpreters is ludicrous."
1,don't believe the hype,"I knew the author in college and enjoyed her fiction for the Harvard Advocate, admittedly against my will.I read this collection hoping that the spark she had shown back then had developed into something more substantial. Unfortunately, ""lucky girls"" is as unimpressive as she was--mediocre, pretentious, run-of-the-mill with a passably attractive cover.My advice to Nell: Better luck next time (though perhaps her luck has run out--much has been wasted on this overhyped collection). There's talent in there somewhere....but these stories ain't where it is."
1,way over hyped drivel,"don't waste your time. This author would be a great tween novelist - you know, coming of age stories for 15 year olds, stuff like that. Like the Sweet Valley High books, that's what she should be writing. i didn't get a real feel of any depth from any of the characters and I found the sex scenes gratuitous and boring. Also, having been to Asia myself, her little infobites about the locations of her stories seemed to be taken straight of guidebooks to Asia. (Details from the 1st story in the book for example -yes, the taj is closed on Mondays and there may have been a twin black Taj built across from it --- I bet the author read that info in the same place I did- the Taj chapter in the Rough Guide to India!) This is pop stuff, pretending to be high art. so, two thumbs down. I bet her publishers feel pretty dumb now!"
1,Not good,"I'm heartened that most of the author's Amazon reviews are so poor - they average barely over 2 stars - because this proves to me that you can't fool the entire book reading public all the time. Despite the book's critical acclaim, it is apparent that many readers could see how awful this book was and were disappointed enough to write a review to express how they really felt and warn others off of it. I will be curious to see how her sophomore effort is received, which will soon be published. Instead of reading it I will reread the excellent Epicure's Lament by Kate Christenson. (5 stars on Amazon)"
4,Chance Chanel,"Quick delivery. I received it before Christmas Eve. Very small bottle, but I understand it is expensive perfume. I was happy with the item."
2,Be careful,"The gasket is made of some kind of plastic, if you over tighten it WILL break the seal and the entire hose will be ruined."
3,Psychedelic Space Rock,"This is one of their better efforts, although I miss the wordless female vocals present on their first two albums. Still, this disc has a lot to offer in the way of spacey, psychedelic rock in the Ozric Tentacles or Steve Hillage vein. And ""Spheres of Mystery"" is probably Melting Euphoria's best song ever."
5,Beginner's Guide to Braiding,I found this book to be an excellent guide for the rank amateur....which I AM! It is very easy to understand with good photos and drawings. Perhaps the best part is that it tells you how to make your very own tools and spools (just in case you don't want to go buy everything before you even know if you have an affinity for it).
5,Great introductory reference for Kumihimo,This book offers beautiful step by step pictures how to make great variety kumihimo braiding. I used it at school where I taught Japanese culture and my students benefit greatly.
1,YAWN,"Yet another con job. What are Sterns cedentials??????????? I have tried to read Sterns sophomoric attempts of realationship enlightenment: ""Loving an Imperfect Man"" and ""He just doesn't get it"". Now she attempts to make a buck claiming she can help you sleep. Stern must be well connected to get this drivel published."
5,Monette's Yoga Series,Monette really is the Yoga Diva of Hollywood! Great series. Very easy to follow instructions. Beautiful music and animations. I highly recommend it.
4,Looking good,I have used the phone hand set for a few months and the quality of the voice communications is very good.
1,Good phone - Bad Mac driver,"For the first three weeks I was in heaven with this phone - it worked almost flawlessly. Then Apple released an audio update to OS X via Software Update. The free.2 software on my MacBook Pro now does nothing but unexpectedly quit. I contacted Ipevo many times via both email and telephone requesting that they update the free.2 Mac driver software, but they repeatedly and callously replied that it was something I was doing, or something having to do with my computer, when the real issue is their driver software.So now my free.2 phone is useless - the free.2 software quits unexpectedly every time it's plugged in!Advice: If you are a Mac person, don't buy Ipevo products - they will not be supported."
4,Enjoyable,If you liked the first movie then you'll like this movie. Po's trials and tribulations make for an amazing story. The choice of voice actors for this are wonderful. The animation is beautiful.
2,Much less interesting than the original,"Nowhere near as good as the first one.The first one was funny, witty, clever, and fun.This movie is just a lot of animated kung fu, and fight scenes that seem endless (not in a good way).I rarely write reviews, but I was truly anticipating watching this movie with my kids - we had so much fun watching, and re-watching, the original Kung Fu Panda. Sure, there's a little back story about Po, but there is none of the newness of the first. In short, skip it - unless you are really into the kung fu - in which case you'll appreciate the long long long fight scenes.For my money, I'll re watch the first one, or any of the solid older films in the genre (Incredibles, Madagascar (1 or 2), Ratatouille, etc)..."
2,Lame sequel,"They took a good story and made it a low budget follow up. I mean, a chase scene in broken carts? Not without it's moments, but there's a reason Pixar is consistently better!"
2,Boring and Trite,"If you take all the martial arts cliches, and carbon copy them to the Nth degree you would get ""Kung Fu Panda 2,"" which is to say that this is the most pointless martial arts movie ever made. I really don't understand what the producers were thinking. Were they thinking along the lines of: well, this movie is based in China, and it's about Chinese culture, and so we need to be as trite and cliched as possible in this film?"
5,Better Than The Original,"How many times have we all seen sequels that pale in comparison to the original; too many times to count for sure. Thankfully, this is NOT one of those times! This is a fantastic movie, and good as the original was, this one is even better. If you can believe it, somehow they managed to make it more exciting, more action packed, and yet, sweeter and more sentimental and touching too. The bonus features are a hoot. Lots of fun stuff to look at. It's just a shame this movie didn't do better in theaters. We don't recall what it opened against, but recall that this never hit #1. It's a shame, since maybe it didn't get the audience it deserves. But here's your chance to catch this new classic at home. It's really a good one! Hope they make a third one. Could watch this on again and again. Stunning visuals and animation too. Really top-shelf."
5,as good as the first,It's hard to find a sequel that matches the first when expectations are so high but this movie delivered just as many funny and cute moments as the first movie.
4,3.5 stars,"I would give this movie 3.5 stars, if that were an option. I didn't think it was as good as the first and it was way too much fighting and kung fu. I think it should've been more of a story and kung fu, which it was but the frist was all story combined with kung fu. It's about how Po, now the dragon warrior, is doing lots of fighting but he wonders where he came from. If you saw the first you might like the second, or like me you might rather just stick with the first."
5,REview,Thanks for the movie we do enjoy having it. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
4,Loved it!,I loved the first movie so I definitely wanted to watch this one too. It didn't disappoint-- very cute animated film and good storyline. I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it.
4,cute movie,"me and my children really enjoyed this movie (2 & 4) and it shipped fast, came in excellent condition so i was really happy and have no complaints."
4,"Incredible picture and sound, good movie","The 3D is some of the best I've seen in a while. A very nice mix of pop-out and depth, the 3D disc is spectacular. I found extremely mild ghosting on background objects when viewed on my active 3D set. It's not distracting in the least. The 3D darkens the image in some night scenes, but not nearly as bad as other 3D I've seen.The 2D is crisp and clear, with great color and detail. Sound is great, this disc (like the 3D) makes very good use of surround sound.The movie itself is unexpectedly charming, and more mature than I expected. Not mature in a way inappropriate for kids, just more sophisticated in humor, action, and character development.Overall, I recommend it highly, but don't feel comfortable giving it 5 stars with the minor issues on the 3D disc."
5,Marvelous!,Marvelous! A wonderful followup to Kung Fu Panda. It very much joins the story of the Dragon Warrior with the Fantastic Five!
4,Good sequel,"Jack Black is back as a Panda. If you like how that sounds, rent or buy this. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one. The villain isn't as interesting, and several bits are just stupid, but minor problems associated with movies made for kids aside, I liked this movie more than the original. Loved that the super-style is tai-chi :)"
5,Funny and entertaining for the whole family,It's a movie any family can enjoy together. There is no uncomfortable scenes like some disney movies. Funny movie and interesting film. Story line is easy to follow.
3,Jack Black makes the movie,"I think Jack Black's comical style and identifiable voice makes this movie more engaging than it would be without him.Not one of my personal favorites, but the boys have liked the orig. Kung Fu Panda AND the TV show.Got this for the long road trip to FL -- would have been just as happy to rent it.Movies like Toy Story, Ice Age, and Incredibles have more well-developed story lines, filled with humor, sarcasm and witty dialogue that make it more widely appealing (kids to adults).This movie is not of the same caliber...but, it is a decent show."
4,Skidoush!,"A GREAT sequel! This one will definitely make you laugh! It does feel a little different than the first one, them chasing down the villain seemed to be the focal point in it, but it does tell about Po's history of how he came to be adopted by a goose. Very entertaining movie, a must see! Good for all ages!"
3,Panda 1 was better,Watched this as I thorouhly enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 1. The second movie is not as good and could not keep my attention.
4,To Sequel or not to Sequel?,"This film was funny! I have to say in the land of sequel this film was a MUST purchase.My children loved it.It captured the same elements that the first one captivated you with, a simple yet unprepared hero who is taking on the world and finding out about himself.As a family who is seeking to adopt this film was great for our kids to see the story of an adoptive family helping a child.Great film!"
4,"Good, but not as good as the first.","I bought this for my little brother, but he didn't really like it too much. I also bought him Cars 2 and he really enjoyed that one, but it was actually an OK movie. So it all depends on what your child is into. I liked Kung Fu Panda 2 better than Cars 2."
4,Skadoosh!,Bring some Zen to your life and kids. This is an enjoyable sequel to the series that your kids and you can enjoy.
1,disc wouldn't play,"My dvd player simply can't read the disc that was sent to me (The player reads every other disc just fine). I didn't bother trying to return it though (since I purchased it 6 weeks before xmas, and didn't figure it was worth the trouble given we didn't realize it was bad until a full 2 months after purchasing it), so I can't comment on how this company would've handled the problem, but regardless, the disc they sent me was junk."
3,Running Out of Blue,"This album is worth the purchase just for ""Running Out of Blue"", which could be a radio song. Karen has a fantastic voice that fits well with a country bluegrass style. The album is somewhat eclectic, with a couple irish folk type numbers, some slow ballads, and some experimental story-songs where Chris is the lead vocal. While I appreciate the creativity and diverse style of the album, I would rate it higher if there where more american folk/country/bluegrass tunes like ""The Storm"", ""Running Out of Blue"", and ""Falling"". These are great songs that fit the artists well stylistically. I bought this album at a live show in upstate Wisconsin. Chris and Karen are a lot of fun to see live."
5,Desmo Donte is the King of Vampires,"Desmo Donte is THE band to listen to on this cd. The lead singer, Riccardo has a beautiful voice that haunts deep to your innermost soul....""Into the Sun"" still lingers in my mind....good job Desmo Donte...and Riccardo :)"
5,Mustang Love,Great DVD with excellent information and pictures. Loved the history story and explanations of the models. The pictures and video footage were fantastic.
2,Good DVD for a Mustang Fan,"This DVD shows very good restored and original Ford Mustangs but I think that could be better if chapters are indexed by model year, because they are a little mixing and makes some confusing.By last I'm living in Mexico, so I appreciated more languages for the DVD, is only available in English."
5,"The dog can't learn your language, but you can learn his.","Excellent resource for people who want to understand and communicate with their dogs instead of relying on gimmicks intended merely to control them. Written in a lighthearted, easy to understand style, this little book puts the plain old fun back into having a dog in the family and lets you know that neither you nor your canine child is crazy.The author likes dogs AND people, and it shows. Go for it!"
4,Yes returns to form!!,"Disc 1 -- the live stuff -- is the same old setlist of old stuff. If you want interesting latter-day concert versions, go to Keys To Ascension 1. However, if you want to hear some of the best studio Yes in many years, stick with this. I'd put the 18-minute Mind Drive up against ANYTHING this band has ever done!"
2,Pleasantly Surprised (2-and-a-half stars),"The song writing and the overall quality of the studio tracks on this recording were a pleasant surprise. This is the best example of the attempt of 90s Yes to combine their progressive rock legacy with contemporary sounds. 'Mind Drive' could possibly be the best extended piece the band has written since 'Awaken' on 'Going for the One'. Although 'Mind Drive' in some places exhibits weaker moments compositionally; overall it is a strong piece; in places it is awesome. The other shorter pieces on the album mostly hold their own quite well.The album is supplemented by live versions of some of the best of there 70s material. Since the release of this album, a compilation of the Key I & II studio tracks has been released."
4,The best of the two K.T.A. discs,"Where both Keys To Ascension recordings are strong efforts it is this, the second of the two, that is the superior collection of material. It is the studio work of these two double discs that makes them relevant as it presents Yes sounding their best since the 70's. It is remarkable that they can regroup after all of this time and produce such quality material. Yes, there is the occassional wart, but overall it is a terrific return to form (after almost 20 years). Enjoy it while it lasted, as Wakeman soon left leaving Yes to assume a new, less compelling direction. The first worthwhile effort since the end of the 70's. Highly recommended...Simon"
3,mostly bland and inoffensive,"I bought this to listen to the latter days Yes studio tracks. While I find them a step or two above Big Generator, they are not as good as the classic stuff, nor as good as the surprising Magnification album. The live tracks are well known classics, just better recorded and produced than past versions. If you're like me and don't mind buying used cds, you might find interesting the fact that it's cheaper to get the two ""Keys to Ascenscion"" double cds than the single ""Keystudio"". I've read that the mix is a little different, but honestly, does that matter to most of us?"
2,Same stuff all over again,"The concept behind the album is flawed: one live disc, one disc in the studio. The live songs have obviously been ""enhanced"" in the studio, especially the vocals, so they sound lifeless and do not recreate the magic of this reunion in a small theatre in California. As for the studio songs, only ""Mind Drive"" is really interesting. The rest sounds like a collection of progressive rock clichés. There's little coherence in the songs, the band just pastes together different bits and pieces hoping that in the end, some form of song will emerge. Maybe this type of material will please nostalgic fans of prog-rock but to me it sounds more like a band trying too much to copy what they were doing in their golden age. There's nothing ""progressive"" about that material, this formula has been done before, and with a lot more success, on albums like ""Close to the Edge"" and ""Fragile"". As a reunion of the ""classic"" Yes lineup, it's a disappointment."
3,"OK, but cheaply made.","We bought this as a gift for adults. It looked much better in the picture then in real life. The material is sturdy plastic (?) but the paint job is terrible: sloppy and messy, some dots only half painted, some dots not painted in at all.... and after a dozen games they already show wear. Maybe OK for kids as an occasional game, but not if they are going to use it a lot and certainly not for adults. Not durable at all."
2,The Dominoes are *NOT* made of wood!,"I wanted to give a heads-up to customers who were expecting wooden dominoes, that the only thing made of wood is the case the dominoes come in. The description of this product is deceptive, or to be more accurate, simply false. One would assume that since these dominoes come from Melissa and Doug that they would be made of wood, and it is really impossible to discern what they are made of from the picture. In actuality, they are plastic with a sort of faux wood grain painted on them to make them appear more rustic. The label on the box even claims the dominoes were all ""hand sanded"". Hand-sanded plastic? I'm afraid so.Since I purchased these dominoes in order to use them for jewelry-making and not for the actual game of dominoes, I had specifically wanted wooden dominoes. If you are okay with plastic ones masquerading as wooden dominoes, then you may enjoy them just fine.Happy Holidays to all!Steff J. in Kentucky"
3,A cop hires Laurel & Hardy to break into his chief's house,"At first it just seems like cop Edgar Kennedy will not let Laurel & Hardy sleep on a park bench. But Kennedy has a better idea. It seems there have been a rash of robberies in his neighborhood and his chief is not happy with him. So Kennedy hires the boys to break into his chief's house so he can chase them away. Of course, even fake crime does not pay as all three find out in the end. This 1930 two-reeler directed by James Parrott from a story by Leo McCarey might be twice as funny if it was half as long. The routines, such as breaking into the house, go on for too long. ""Night Owls"" is okay, but we have seen much better from Laurel & Hardy."
3,Pretty average....,"I have this product. It's ok albeit a bit too large. For a beginner, you can't really tell when you're at the correction inflation point. It's listed as anti-burst but completely popped like a balloon after some average use."
2,Big Red Bally's Logo,"This ball is a completely normal exercise ball. We returned it because it has a big red Bally's logo on the side. The logo is not shown in any of the pictures of the ball. My husband doesn't like Bally's because they harassed us so much when he quit the gym, so it's a bad association for him. We returned the ball."
1,I can't even use this product ...,"This was frustrating ... I was excited to buy this as a gift for one of my kids (who absolutely LOVES Penguins) ... problem is, once you receive the package, you then realize that unless your computer has special hardware/software -- which is not standard on older PCs -- you will not be able to even try it.My kid was waiting for me to install it ... and was SOooooooooo disappointed to find out that she wouldn't be able to 'play' afterall!ALL software being sold should clearly indicate ALL hardware and software requiements upfront (before the sale).If you have a new mondo computer with an accelerated graphics card, you might be able to use it ... not in my case (I have a 866 Mhz PC with 1-gig RAM, big Hard Drive, Windows XP, & standard built-in graphics).Hope this review saves someone from having the heart-ache that I had!GMBDo not buy this unless you are sure it will work on your system."
5,Great book for beginners!,Great book! It's great for beginners and spells everything out in an easy to learn way. I enjoyed the examples and all the little extras they added here and there to make everything sink in well.
1,A SERIOUS MISTAKE IN A BOX,"These CD's represent what happens when a record company has access to music they have to pay little or nothing for the rights to reproduce and market. The audio quality is atrocious and the music means nothing---""In Search of Space Indeed""! The quicker this arty-fact disappears the safer all unsuspecting buyers will be."
5,6 stars * * * * * *,"I don't generally write reviews, but felt a need to respond to Deanne's comments below. No, this is certainly not 'Dogs for Dummies'. This is a book that goes much deeper than 'how to' train your dog. It teaches us not only how dogs think but also helps *us* to think when dealing with the 4 footed that share our lives. Instead of an instant answer or step by step by step guide, this book is a thoroughly useful and fascinating discussion of how our dogs see and react to the world. And with that we are given the tools to further understand and work with our dogs... proving that we too can think :)If you have read everything ethologist Patricia McConnell has ever written and want to go deeper into the nitty gritty, this book is for you. So many interesting facts, and the theories are thoroughly discussed and explained and examples given. A terrific read."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I most certainly would.,"I had high hopes when I ordered this book, given the many star ratings it recieved, only to be greatly disappointed. This book left a lot to be desired. Too many pages, too wordy, not a book for those in search of a concise how to tell all on the K9. I don't want a book that is hard to decipher when I need a how-to guide with a bit of why. Just wasn't for me and may not be for you....trying to save people the frustration of having to return it, really grateful to amazon for their return policy in this particular case. Sincerely, DL in NJ USA"
2,Not very bright,Overall I wasn't very impressed with these bulbs. They get pretty hot and weren't very bright like most LED Christmas bulbs I've seen. I won't use these again next year.
1,Return of the waste of paper,This is one of the most laughabe lamely written books that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. If you wanna read stupid stuff about how the author can just look at people and know that they are demons ect. then go ahead and waste your money the same way I did.The author is full of hatred and judgement and wants to be veiwed as a messiah. Truly worthless waste of paper.
1,Somebody help him!,"This author writes about subjects that I believe merit real study and discussion. He does a disservice to the issues, with his mad ramblings. The one thing I learned from his book is that he needs psychological help. I am not big on medicating people, but in his case I'll make an exception."
5,GREAT buy.,"I really like this CD. The guitarist is very talented and the music brings back memories of Mexico to me. A soothing, happy selection. Features Antonio Bribiesca's finest."
5,Inspiring and easy to read,"I had borrowed this from the university library, but when the copy was requested back I had to buy one of my own. The first chapters especially, are thought-provoking, well-written and interesting. They give some good ideas for new avenues of research in the very important area of Statistics teaching."
1,>_<,The thing broke in a day. The gift box it came in had stains and smelled inside. Threw the box away in hurry. Maybe not the seller's fault (except for the box) but I would not buy similar product ever again.
4,Cute.,"The actually balls were very vibrant and beautiful the only real complaint I have on this purchase was the little box they came in, it was falling a part and flimsy as can be! Although the box is obviously not why I purchased this, I would have rather gotten them in a Ziploc bag than this box."
1,Photo is not what you get!,The photo is to what you get at all. First I got red balls in a purple case and after complaining they sent me green balls in a green case. Both were not the correct symbol and the cases are very ugly. The balls them self are very poorly done with mistakes with painting and they have numerous imperfections on the surface that are not smooth. After contacting them again they said they are out of the black case and will not be getting any more in. Not worth your time! Can anyone show me where I can get nicer ones?
3,not quite right,Pictured blue. Came as green.they are not smooth.have bumps around them. But for the price they will do. I will have to invest in a better set later.
1,wrong color item received,Was not pleased with the item received. Called the phone number on the recipt and left a msg that item received was green not blue and this was a gift for someone.
3,Helios takes control,"After Damon Edge' death in 1995, Helios took back the name Chrome and give it a sonic aspect not far from the original Chrome sound of early eighties. The 90s Damon's Chrome band was a little more clean and rigid, Helios' one is more aggressive and quite experimental. However, it is not as exciting as it could be. The listener can be easily bored by some of the tunes out there. But there is some pretty enjoyable tracks too (hear ""More space"", ""Artificial human""). It still stands as a proof that Chrome will never be as fantastic as in the early days, with BOTH of creation kommanders: Damon and Helios."
3,A step back in the right direction.,"After guitarist/vocalist Helios Creed left Chrome in the mid 80's, keyboardist/vocalist Damon Edge released a number of albums under the Chrome name, most of which were considered by fans to be a dulled down version of the bands psychotic, industrial sound. This album, recorded by Creed and other previous band members after Edge's death is somewhat of a return to their old sound. Don't expect another Half Machine Lip Moves, but don't avoid this album because it ""isn't real Chrome."" All in all, not bad, very listenable, and experemental enough to keep me interested."
2,both the 1997 and 2008 release stink,"Why Helios Creed didn't push for higher quality control, I don't know. The music is excellent as is typically the case with Helios Creed but if you buy any version of the album prepare to be screwed. The 1997 CD won't play on a computer! Why? Was Cleopatra that ahead of the downloading and CD copying game that they refuse to let me play it on media player? And the 2008 version is recorded with glitches and skips! I thought my CD was scratched but that's how it was mastered! I haven't heard the LP version but read that it also contains the skips! The only benefit is that if you never listen to CDs on the computer, it shouldn't make a difference with the old version while the reissue contains three neat bonus tracks which sound fine I suppose. But come on, this is a professional release. There should definitely be a recall but since the indie scene isn't dominated by Chrome/Helios Creed fans, I feel you're just gonna have to get shafted."
2,Baby rolls right out of bed,"We bought this for our 6 1/2 month infant to use inside our pop up camper. It was the only lightweight infant travel bed I found that appeared to work for infants that could already roll over. The instructions have a disclaimer about not putting the baby on a raised surface, but we thought it would work well on the floor. Unfortunately when he rolled, the sides bent down and he rolled right out. Also he learned to pull up during our vacation and the sides just collapsed when he pulled on them. As this bed did nothing to contain the baby, it was no better than laying him directly on a blanket on the floor. He ended up sleeping in our bed, since this was safer than him rolling around unattended at night. We did let him nap in it while we were watching him. Also, the mattress cover is not removable for washing. Next time we will bring just bring the Pack & Play."
2,marginal product ... at best .....,it may have slowed the leak down a little ..... I know that it was a good gasket that was leaking .... it was the cylinder gasket on my motorcycle .... and I replaced it myself 7000 miles earlier .....
3,It's not that bad,"Man, the last two reviews would make you think that it was entirely noise. It's actually got some really good songs on here. Granted some of the songs could have been left off an no one would have noticed, a couple of songs sound just like Dead Can Dance, but there are a few that are gold. Leaether Strip's cover of The Carnival is Over was a perfect interpretation of DCD's style."
3,Not bad for DCD fans,"This isn't that bad of a CD. The one reviewer below got it right... this isn't the greatest by no means, but if you're a DCD fan you'll enjoy some of the songs on this."
1,the shame is on your face,"i think i won't be able to be smart enough with my english to correctly writing here how far this ""album"" is from the original DcD spirit, having tried to mix (?) it through a piece of software i presume and put into these immortal songs some hip hop or dance or crust like that."
4,"The more I listen, the more I like it.","Some of these reviews would make you think that it was entirely noise. It's actually got some really good songs on here. Leaether Strip's cover of The Carnival is Over was a perfect interpretation of DCD's style. It was truely inspired by them, and plays great in their style. It's a great pay back for what Dead Can Dance gave to the gothic community."
1,the dead can dance without it,"being a hard core dead can dance fan, this just didn't do it. maybe if i hear the hole album!!"
2,is fun!,"expected more, little loud I think! but still fun.. would try one with multispeeds.. it is fun for the price.. you get what you pay for..:)"
3,a little on the large side,"I bought this for fun, and it was a little on the large side for my tastes. also the plastic ridge sometimes catches and pinches skin on the inside and its pretty loud. if you go out into public wearing it though, people will jus think your cell is vibrating and it is fun to do that and had the remote to your partner."
1,bought two they dont work,"bought two, cant make either of them work SAVE YOUR MONEY i must have 20 words so have a fun time to bad they dont work."
1,Oh my god...,"...a history lesson of the worst kind.It just seems endless.I tossed it after the first 60 pages.And I consider it as a major achievement to even get that far.Don't do it! Boring, boring boring..."
3,Analog Roadside Companion will no longer work by Feb '08,"I Just purchased the Roadside Companion X2 for my boys who have Dodge trucks so no Onstar. Knowing that Analog Onstar will no longer work after December '07, unlike digital Onstar, I called Procon, the manufacturer of Roadside Companion to inquire if this analog issue is going to be a problem. I was glad I did because I found out that it will no longer work by February '08 (which gives me 6 months of use). So, I now know why the units were on sale and am now debating whether or not to return these units or use them for the 6 months left for peace of mind for my sons as well as the lovely ability to track their whereabouts online by the GPS system when the unit is plugged in (cost is $.99 each tracking)."
4,"Ok, but . . .",Positives: Easy to set up and install. Operators are helpfulNegatives: response times sometimes slow (more than 2-3 minutes). They were unable to locate my position on one occasion even another GPS device had no problem at the same location.
2,Get it for the power supply!,"I knew this thing was obsolete - that the transmission towers that make the thing work had been dismantled some time ago. I got it for the power supply. It has a very long cord - the straight kind, not the curly pig tail kind - that can be concealed around the cabin. I needed it for my GPS and it would have cost me a LOT more to buys just a power supply than what I paid for this thing. You also get a free no slip pad that you can use for your cell phone. (BTW - I did try out the unit, of course, it didn't work.) I agree with the other review comments... it seems only be fair to provide some kind of disclosure that this product no longer works."
3,"Minimal for the subject, and consequently incomplete.","The authors make too many leaps of faith that carburetors of a given family can all be covered by a single disassembly-assembly treatise. An excellent example is the 1945/1946/1949 series, which are stated to be similar to the 1940 - nothing could be farther from the truth."
4,"Dark, But a very good Piece of gothic music","I first heard ""Big Electric Cat"" on a gothic music collection. The song ""Paris Sky"" on the collection was up-beat, but a very good gothic song. The Album ""Eyelash"" is not writen in the same style as ""Paris Sky"". This Album is showing a more a darker side of the band, but yet keeps a good, quality gothic sound. Songs such as ""My Last Breath"" and ""Secret Desire"" are more of the darker, and slower songs on the Album. These two songs set the mood for a very dark sounding Album. Other songs such as ""Splinters"" and ""Crash"" return to the type of music that ""Big Electric Cat"" is known for. If you're a fan of gothic music, and like a darker, slower sounding album, then this is for you. Overall, a very good piece of work by the band"
4,Uniquely good.,"Well, the 2nd full-album release from the ""Cat"" is definitely a change of pace from their first release and this might disappoint some, but there is still much to be enjoyed on this more moody and dark album. If you have the spare cash, this is a good pick-up. ""Secret Desire"" is well worth the album price in itself."
3,The jury is out,I bought these because I heard that brewers yeast is supposed to help with milk production. I have taken them for a week now and I haven't seen a significant increase yet.
2,"Large dosage size, terrible taste","I was using this to try and increase my dwindling milk supply. Drinking a beer always did the trick for me so thought this might be a lower calorie way to get the same results. Honestly I didnt see an increase, but I dont know how long you have to take this to see results? The dosage is 3 pills 2x a day and it was hard to remember twice a day to take them. On top of that they are uncoated and REALLY taste bad on your tongue. I don't have any trouble taking pills, but I had a hard time with these."
5,Great for lactation,"This herbal supplement helped with my breast milk production more than anything else I tried. If you are struggling to keep up with your baby's demand, this is a great supplement to increase breastmilk supply."
2,Not working for my hamster,"I bought this for my hamster whose going through hair loss (advice I got from multiple online resources). I've actually haven't this myself, but from what I see and with my poor knowledge of yeast tablets I'd say this is very high quality stuff. My hamster hasn't grown back her fur yet, but that might just be due to her old age and nothing to do with the yeast tablets effectiveness.*This product is also garlic-free and safe for hamsters. (source: I found the scientific name for garlic and checked the ingredients of Solgar's official website)"
2,Knee-slapping funny! Top knotch comedy!!!,"Robin Hood and his merry gang of revelers frollick happily through the forest on an unforgettable tale of love, betrayal, and just plain, old-fashioned fun!"
4,Yo! Yes? in the classroom,"Yo! Yes? is the first book I read to my class each school year. We use it in several ways. First, I explain to my class that sometimes we need a way to focus our attention. So when I say Yo!, they should say Yes? and then stop talking and listen carefully. Next we use this as a guided reading book so that the children can practice how to use punctuation to decide voice inflection when reading. Later still we use the book as a springboard for a discussion of Conflict Mediation and then friendship. I love this book and so do the children in my multiage classroom because in so few words it conveys so much."
3,Yo! Yes?,"Raschka's use of rhythmic one-syllable words to tell a tale of two boys meeting, engaging in getting to know each other, and becoming friends, is complemented by his quirky illustrations. Yo! Yes? teaches children the value of listening to the other person and watching that person's body language to fully understand their intentions. Moreover, the simplistic and repetitive wording is perfect for that ""first reader"".This is a terrific book for its targeted audience of pre-school to Grade 2 children, but it may be too simplistic for an advanced second grade reader. However, Raschka's story of newfound friendship camaraderie is definitely one to share with your children."
1,Very bad book. Influences bad concepts!!!,"Alright, I remember being forced to read this book when I was in second grade. I was not very smart at the time; I decided it would be a cheap way out of a book report. Since the book used no complete sentences at all and portrayed absolutely no message, I was given a very poor grade on the report. Little kids should not be reading this because they may fall into the same trap that I have once stumbled upon. This poorly written book is teaching kids an incorrect way to speak, so instead of teaching, it is poisoning the kid's minds. Buyer Beware!"
5,great treat,We've used these in Maddie's funny bone since she was little and she loves them. I only wish they'd last longer!
3,More of a pamphlet on linkers and loaders than a book,"If you're just looking for a piece of literature to get you started thinking about understanding linkers, this is the book for you. However, if you actually want to write your own linker, you'd best find another book. This book covers all of the popular object and executable file formats such as COFF, ELF, and OMF, but it never really goes in depth or gives any example code, which is exactly what a programmer needs to really get what's going on. Even some pseudocode would've been nice. The only thing I particularly enjoyed about this book was the author's sense of humor, which is a rare thing in the realm of technical books. John Levine pokes fun at himself several times throughout the book, acknowledging that linker programmers are a rare breed indeed - Too bad he couldn't have written a more complete book on linkers, I would've given him a much better review."
4,Who knew linkers could be interesting?,"This book will definitely surprise you if, like me, you had the idea that linkers were just simple, dull tools that ran in the background. The author provides a surprisingly thorough, but understandable, overview of all sorts of linker/loader issues: layout in memory, relocatable code, debugging information, etc., but he does it with such a light, readable style that the material itself doesn't seem particularly difficult. My one complaint is that the book has very little code. The perl-based linker project is basically just a short series of ""suggested exercises"" without much direction. Still, I wouldn't hesistate to recommend this to anyone interested in compilers or operating systems."
4,Best reference of its kind,"I haven't found any better explanations of how linkers and loaders work. The book does a great job describing exactly what it is that linkers/loaders need to do and how they do it. It's one of those topics that isn't very sexy, but it's a critical piece to all computer programs. I had always wondered how linkers/loaders worked and was never able to find a complete picture until I found this book. My only complaint is that I found the coverage of legacy systems a bit tedious and uninteresting, although I admit that it is an important inclusion for historical purposes. I would just have preferred more emphasis on today's modern systems."
5,A must-have book,"As far as I'm aware, this is the only book on the market that covers this subject. Clearly this book will be of use to someone that is starting on writing a link editor (or any other tool that manipulates object files). Even for developers that aren't in that category (myself included), then there were interesting things to be learnt. For instance, prior to reading this book, I was unaware of the exact consequences of compiling PIC code for shared libraries. Now that I understand this better, I'll know the impact on performance of code that is destined for chared libraries."
3,Very superficial; OK as an introduction,"Nothing much to add to that. Well written, good illustrations, all's good, but too superficial and cursory. Unfortunately, short of reading gnu source code, it's the only info source on the topic, so one has to be grateful for what one can get, I guess. For what it is, the book is OK."
4,decent,"Overall this book provides decent coverage on linker technology, covering several popular object formats. I like the book talks more about ELF than others since my project involves ELF. For someone who is not familiar with the subject this book can provide sufficient background for further studying, at the same time giving the reader good working knowledge; however in some ways lacks in-depth explanation on some topics. Keep in mind, being only book on linker design, a subject not well-published - this book deserves 4 stars."
4,This book was interesting for me,"This book was quite interesting for me. Of course, it is not a comprehensive manual, but it is very helpful in understanding of some quite basic OS features. It provides good overview of some existing file formats and even programming exercises (It will be interesting to see a person who ever did them :). So I recommend this book to people who wants to learn some information about this field."
3,too abstract,"maybe it's not the book's fault and instead it's my lack of sufficient background, but this book is hard to understand because of its lack of examples."
2,Utterly disappointing:(,"Im sure this game was developed by a totaly diferent team than the first one, Makes me sad to think of how such a great game as the fist one was stained with something like this.First of all, the game is unresponsive, this being one of the key factors that made FF1 so good. Second, the host shoots out random phrases or stupid things like ""was that a lot of damage player one"", by the way, he has a very limited selection of stupid phrases so sometimes you get the same phrase 3 or 4 times back to back. The menus interaction is really slow(contrary to the theme of the game) and uncomfortable...The games are uncreative, and the ones that got copied from FF1 were ""updated"" and now suck. twisted system has an extremely uncomfortable camera angle and different timing so you get what I mean.Not 1 good game in the 40+Please don't buy this, Im sad I paid these people to ruin such a good game, dont do the same...Utterly disappointing:("
3,Unimpressive,Fusion Frenzy 1 is much better mainly because of the fact that it was fresh when it came out. A lot of the same mini games form Fusion Frenzy 1 make a 2nd appearance in 2. The new games are fun but leave much to be desired. I would wait and buy this game when the price comes down. All in all it is a mildly entertaining multi-player game.
1,A big let down.,"We loved playing the first fusion frenzy. Whenever we have friends and families over, we break out the party games. We assumed as a sequel, this would be as fun or more than the first game.Where the first was fun, competitive, and fast, this game was so slow! We've only managed to play through this once all the way through.Things that slow this game down:-No choice in which mini games you play.-Instead of parts of city like the first, you're now playing for planets. Which take forever.-Frustrating system where you play cards against each other. Becomes a game with unbalanced advantages. A player can quickly get the lead and make it impossible for others to catch up.I felt like the creators tried too hard with this sequel. Where they tried to ""beef up"" the game, they ended up make it a Z-List game."
4,No Xbox live !!!!!!!!!!,It is a funny game very simple great when you play with your friends but the problem is that you cant find any one to play with in xbox live mode i tried to find creat play games in xbox live but no body showed so i dont know what the problem is but the game is great......
2,No better than part 1,"I liked FF 1 better. I guess the sequel didn't outdo it. If you want it, get it used/discounted."
2,I'd love to beat the host with a stick!,"I loved the first game. This one, not so much. Some of the games are mildly entertaining but the presenation and mechanics ruin it. The cards are lame and can ruin even the best player..but nothing drags the experience down like the ""announcer"". He simply won't shut up! To be honest after about 30 minutes my friends and I turned this game off and popped the orignal in never to play FF2 again. If they had a game where you got to smack around the announcer for points I might have given this game another star but..."
2,NEX-GEN? FUZION FRENZY 1 IS MORE FUN,"I have been waiting for this game for months. I loved Fuzion Frenzy on XBox and couldn't wait to see the nex-gen version. I bought this game on its release date and wish I would have waited for a used copy. First and foremost, why did they remove ""Fuzion Frenzy"" from the game? That was the best part of the game, risking your points and stealing your opponents. Second, the announcer is extremely annoying and his quips are repetitive to the point of hurting the game. Also, how hard is it to announce the winning players name. Player 1 wins the tournament, this is nex-gen and the game can't announce the character. If you loved Fuzion Frenzy 1, you might be disappointed in this ""upgrade."" I sure was."
4,Not bad like people say,"First off, this is a party game. You need to play it with 2 or more people.The games are fun. Lots of new challenges and great graphics. Still a little cartoony.The biggest complaint I hear is about the announcer. I don't get why everyone thinks it makes the game so bad because you can just press any button and it skips everything he has to say. IT'S THAT EASY!!I gave this game a four instead of a five because I'm not a huge fan of the card multiplier system. Just weird and too much put up to chance. But its ok because you can customize your own tournament.Wile its not as good as it should be (the original is the best party game ever!), you will love this game if you loved the first one."
2,Total disappointment,"I LOVED the original fuzion frenzy. I was so excited when I got this one, but when I played it I was really disappointed. I don't really like the new mini games. I don't know if it's that I'm used to the old ones, but I really miss those. Also this fuzion frenzy doesn't have that final battle that came after each stage. That totally takes out of the game experience. I just miss a lot of things the old game had :(. I think I might exchange this game for another one."
2,good game for children younger than 10 or for xbox beginner,"If you are a new user for xbox, this game is good for you to exercise how to use the controler precisely and smoothly. And, if you have a boy or girl under 10 years old, this game might be good for them to kill time. But for adult, this game is little bit boring.Another comment: I believe this game is made by a Japanese company - do the characters in the game speak English? Or, terrible English."
5,Sweet,"The game is a lot better the last generation. The graphics are more detailed, the minigames are mixed with the old and the new. Overall its a fun party game."
2,Really only one reason,"there is really only one reason you should buy this game. Easy achievement points. sure we all remember the first one but the controls are nowhere near as precise as they should be on half the games, the announcer is annoying as hell and many of the games just dont give you that feeling of reward. but honestly, given a few hours and someone else over xbox live you can unlock all 1000 pts. there are only 14 achievements."
2,Not that great,I feel that the first Fuzion Frenzy game was fun but with this one has only a couple games that are fun and the guys voice is very annoying. I bought it and have not had the urge to play it again...Do not recommend purchasing waste of money..
3,The announcer got even more annoying,"Announcer was annoying in the first game, they made him even worse in this one. The mini games are okay, but not as good as the first. Plus, you have to unlock pretty much all of them. I don't know why they tried to fix things that weren't broken in the first game."
3,Nothing like FF 1,"This game is just OK. I bought it because I was such a fan of Fuzion Frenzy (1), but it's so much different. It wastes so much of your time talking and explaining and picking this and choosing that. I've had it for months and have only played it twice. Kind of a disappointment."
1,Abraham the Forefather,"Dreadful. The video did a poor job of conveying an accurate story line for the life of Abraham. Also, our teachers who used the film were surprised to see the makers include the circumcision of Isaac: the film shows Abraham (going in slow motion)raising his knife and coming down with it and then the viewer hearing a baby cry. A waste of money..."
4,LEARN LATIN? NO. But inspire your child to WANT TO LEARN LATIN? YES!!!,"This book is not a Latin language primer. Rather, it introduces a child to the world of LATIN. My daughter (11 years old) is absolutely in love with this book and now is really eager to learn the language. This book can be worked with a parent. You really don't need to know the language. It's fun. Has plenty of pics to color and introduces the language in a good light."
4,stories and more travel stories,"This is a collection of stories about people the author met during his trips along the road the years before writing this book. The author is also the founder of the Route 66 Association of Illinois and as such he has a great focus on the underlying fabric of the old route. This book is a somewhat more of a local interest publication perhaps. The stories themselves are excellent, especially for any Route 66 enthousiast. Since it's a collection the reader will like some of them better than the rest, but perhaps that's the nicest feature about the book."
2,dysfunctional,"The overall craftsmanship is crude but functional. The dimensions are as promised, the side poskets are 3"" thick (out of the total 28""). The cloth has a layer or plastic bonded to it on the inside, so it should not get wet in the rain. Except for the black area on the side in the picture. It's a mesh. And no, it's not a mesh pocket on top of the side pocket. It's a mesh that goes straight into the side pocket. So one of the side pockets is unusable right away. But I think that in the rain the water that gets in through the mesh would have nowhere to go, would collect in the pocket and seep into the rest of the bag. This makes the whole bag not really usable for travel."
2,Not pleased,Is anyone else having a horrible experience with the packaging. The bottom disc on every sleeve of my set has come dislodged and the cardboard sleeve detached resulting in every other disc smashed up against the glue that was supposed to hold the sleeve together. Every other disc in the entire set has sticky glue on the back of the disc. I guess I can clean them? Never had to clean glue off of a DVD before...certainly not a brand new $100 set. I actually had to peel some discs off of the sleeve. Displeased.Great show- awful packaging...and isn't the packaging the whole point of a Complete Collection???
4,"Love the Series, Hate the Packaging!","I have collected each season as they were released, watched every episode as they aired, and have preordered Season 8 as soon as it was listed on Amazon. This deluxe edition is a great savings over the seperate sets,if you don't already own 1 thru 7, but why-oh-why must they be in such destructive packaging. I get the idea of bio-degradable paper to save the earth and all that, but please - I'm not buying a deluxe collector's set to put it in landfill! These slide-in slots scream self destruction to the discs, often during the manufacturing process before I even get them. So minus 1 star... paper or plastic? Save it for disposable consumed goods, not my archive of favorite shows."
5,LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE HOUSEWIVES!!!,"Needless to say I watched the entire season of Desperate Housewives and it is one of the best shows I have ever seen and now I get to watch it over and over again.It's full of glamour, drama, laughter and tears.Buy it!"
2,Desperate Housewives Complete Series,"Great series. Some bumpy seasons for sure but a stellar cast really holds the show together. However, for being the complete collection of this emmy winning series, they sure did skimp on the package. The cardboard dvd holders, (as almost all reviewers mention) are awful. They do not hold or secure the discs and they are held together by a little drop of glue and in fact, a couple of my disc (bottom ones) would get stuck in the glue. Not sure why ABC and Buena Vista went so cheap but I would have rather paid $20-$30 more for a complete series set that would not ruin my dvds."
5,great series,"This was my favorite tv series, and I really am enjoying watching them and owning this collection. It is packaged very nicely and it is an impressive collection that I value"
2,packaging sucks.,Very poor for a deluxe edition the sleeved packaging sucked and all DVD sleeves were unstuck.Disks were everywhere inside.
5,works well,"While the eye cream made a more dramatic difference, the skin cream has also made a visible improvement after about 4 weeks."
2,NIA 24,My dermatologist recommended this product for hyperpimentation. Haven't seen a difference so far and it's been a month.
1,IT DOESN'T WORK!!!,"So, I used the cream for about two months. My brown spots are still brown and my face isn't soft like it used to be, it has bumps everywhere!! I had to go to a dermatologist and my face is now in recovery time. Don't buy it!!"
2,NIA24,Nia24 Skin Strengthening Complex Repair Cream $74.68 delivered in timely fashion of 4 days was 1.7 oz. instead of 1.8 oz. which was advertised.No explanation of difference even though minor. No receipt or information for return if not satisfied.No further orders from this reviewer. An ounce is an ounce!
5,fantastic cream,NIA24 is the best cream I have every used. Over time it eradicates most of the brown sun spots and leaves the face very smooth. It also is a super moistureizer. Don't let the price fool you. A tube lasts a very long time.
5,Great jeans!,Great jeans in a hard to find size. They arrived quickly. I will buy them here from now on.
2,Like Wearing Canvas,"These may well be durable jeans - or they may just last a long time because no one wants to wear them! They are made of an extremely stiff fabric that, it seems, not even numerous washes could soften! They also run small. My husband laughed when he tried these on and not with joy. I am returning."
4,Love Wranger Cow Boy Cut,"Our son is thin and looks good in the wrangler cowboy cut jeans. These wear similar to a pair of levi's. Previously we were only able to find these for a good price at TSC but they had limited colors. We have since found these jeans on sale at amazon and picked up a stonewash pair to try. They look and feel like the Levi's jeans. I hope they are as durable as his other heavier wranglers purchased from TSC, but for now we are just pleased he has a nice looking (great color) new pair of jeans."
2,fly front doesn't lay flat,"after first washing the fly front doesn't lay flat. it looks like the fly is open, at first glance. will try sewing the two layers together. the fabric is very stiff"
5,"comfortable, durable, great value for money","I have worn nothing else but wrangler cowboy cut jeans for the last 30 years.I find them comfortable, durable and excellent value for money.I would recommend them to all my friends but they wear them already ........ lol"
3,one fit - the other one didn't,I ordered these for my husband -- the black one fit well and the blue didn't fit at all. don't understand?? I bought the same size in both of them.
5,Best Jeans and Best Fit For me and my Ariat's,"I never do revues but also never thought I'd be finding my favorite Cowboy Cut jeans on Amazon.com. No jeans fit my 6'4"" 250lb frame and ride on my Ariat boots than these Wranglers and at a price I couldn't believe. Thanks Amazon U guys rock!!BrentOceanside, CA"
4,Shallow Pockets,These jeans are good value for the money. My only complaint is that the front pockets are too shallow.
4,got to wash them a lot to break them in,also very durable and a good value given that they will last forever and look good at the same time
2,Poor QC,One of the belt loops was not sewed at the top of the waist band. Would have been hard to miss if the pants had been inspected propertly.
4,Way too tight,"I had to return mine. I usually wear 28x30 Levis, but since I'm wearing boots with these, I thought I'd order 28x32. Well, please order 2 sizes bigger in the waist, as these were an inch tighter than my current Levis, *before* washing the Wranglers. Otherwise, I think I'll be very happy with them once I have the right size. Everything else is very well made and the orange stitching really adds to look.EDIT: Amazon overnighted a new pair for no extra charge and now I have a 30x32 size and all is well. Seem huge but wash and they shrink to a 29 or 28."
2,Not as advertised,"They advertised these Jeans as being 37X32, far from it they are more like 38 waist the length was correct but I was very unsatisfied with the results after washing several times now they still feel like there two sizes to big and for the price of jeans these days I won't be buying from these people again."
5,Traditional cowboy jeans,These jeans are a staple in my equine pursuits. The fit and construction ensure durability during long hours in the saddle - I ride 5 days a week. The ridgid indigo denim wears down to a great texture over time that just can't be accomplished via stone washing or the like.
1,Very stiff,"They are nice pants. But very stiff! That size is very hard to find, so he is washing them a lot to soften them up"
2,Nice fit but whats up with this hard crease?,I really like the fit of these Wranglers. Used to wear Levis but they have severely changed the way they fit. I don't like what Levis did to their 505 jeans by making them lowrise and they also made the material much lighter weight than they used to be. So it was a relief to try these Wranglers and find that the material is heavy weight and they have a normal rise. The problem I'm having though is they develop a very hard unusual random and apparently permanent crease in them. They will also start to rapidly fade along this crease and they look and fit terrible once this happens. I have been returning them because this shouldn't be happening.
5,Jeans,great value wears well cleaning is great no missing seams or stitches fit is fantastic looks awesome and in a size that was needed.
2,Very Stiff Jeans,"This denim is the most stiff fabric I've ever felt. I didn't even know jeans came this way.Probably ideal for work jeans if you are in construction or something but for daily wear for my teen, not the best."
2,bought these,"i made a mistake in these, i bought a size too large lol!!all in all they are well put together and the basic cowboy wranglers"
3,Specs not correct,"I recently bought Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jean. The fitting is OK but I was expecting ""Button Fly"" as specified in the web site but I received ""Zipper fly"" and I am not very happy with this. I specifically ordered this pair for Button Fly. Hope Amazon clarifies this."
2,So hard,"I don't like this of Angler Men's Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jean ,it's so hard. I want teturn this, but US is far away."
1,unhappy!!,I am unhappy. The 42X32L correspond to 44X34L. Do not understand why so much difference? I am wranger buyer for many years but now give it to any family or friend and I will not waste any more time. I hope to have luck next purchase if I do not buy Lee or Levis.
1,"Strange,tough ,Unwearable, UGLY","i ordered the rigid indigo denim,W38 L30, this is not a jeans to wear, the fabric is so tough,ugly, very uncomfortable, unwearable,i regret the order and will send it back."
1,Buy these if you like sliding into a pair of boards sewn together,"Wow, these are WAYYYYYY uncomfortable and certainly not made for someone who doesn't want to wash them 100 times before they are wearable. If they gave these away, I would still not want them."
3,"Good quality, bad sizing","Denim is heavy, build quality seems solid (can really tell this after using for some time) but sizing is really badI have read other reviews and ordered 32w. I wear 30, 31 is a bit too wide, but still acceptable. 32 for this one is still quite tight, I can wear it, but not too comfortably. I am giving 3 stars only because of this. I think sizing is very important when shopping online. I know that size of different manufacturers may vary a little bit, not everyone makes exactly same, but 2+ unit difference seems too much.And I can't return it because I shop from outside of USA and shipping back is too much hassle.so as an advice I suggest to buy +3w from what you actually wear and maybe +2 of length."
5,excellent value,"I purchased these for my ""country music"" loving son. He was happy with the ""cowboy"" fit. I was very happy with these jeans. I liked the quality and price and am planning to purchase additional pairs for his upcoming birthday"
2,Disappointed with this purchase,"I normally have good luck with Amazon purchases, but this was a dud.The Prime delivery was fine, but the jeans were defective.They arrived, I washed them, wore them to work.Then when i put my hand in the pocket, i found the pocket was folded upwards and was riveted to the jeans.Since I was at work, I had to cut around the rivet and sew the 2 holes.After all this I wasn't going to bother with the return process( I already put work into the jeans myself)I'm guessing these are factory seconds, and would like to know the vendor, so as to avoid them in the future."
5,LEather Strip,"Leather Strip is one of the longest running, and one of the most sucessful Industrial acts to date. Combing heavy and melodramatic sounds it blends to become one of my favorite bands. IF you like Wumpscut,. Front Line Assembly, or Haujobb, check out LEather Strip"
4,Excellent,"Just what I needed. Be very careful about polarity, the wires are not marked! Otherwise I would give it 5 starts."
1,Product arrived D.O.A.,Product arrived with soldering points broken off. I had to re-solder them back on myself. It would have been cost prohibitive to return the item.
4,Simple yet effective,"We've slowly been upgrading the tree stands that we use for deer hunting and recently started dropping batteries in with solar panels to top them off. The primary use has been to wire in some lighting to make it easier to get set up in the morning and pack up in the evening. But, it gives the added benefit of having 12v DC power available for topping off phones, iPods, or even running an iPad or netbook like my uncle likes to do during the long mid-day hours when the deer don't move around as much.Of all the various options I found to add power ports to the tree stands that I looked at this was by far the easiest I could find. I was easily able to splice two of these into the 12v power line I have coming off the battery and then use a couple of pipe straps to hold them in place. It may not be the prettiest piece of wiring ever, but hey I have power in my tree stand now."
1,Item arrived defective,Item arrived defective. I wired everything up correctly and it did not work. I ran down to Napa bought another model hooked it up the same way and the Napa one works great. Poor quality and unless you want to waste your money don't buy this.
1,PC Hagiography,"This is a politically correct hagiography of a ""poor little rich girl"" playing radical environmentalist. Her bourgeois childhood violin lessons were parlayed into ""fiddling"", reflective of the condescending ""working class"" schtick that was such a part of her self-image. The dark intimations that ""the System"" bombed her played into her legend as some manner of ""threat"" when in fact the genuine source of the explosion was a someone a lot closer indeed, as the latest book on her(...). Nonetheless she was a real success as an American: a whole industry has sprung up around her, despite the fact that her goofy antics ruined Earth First! This piece of work does three things: it shows that in America anyone essentially can define themselves as they like; that no matter how wacky you are some people will follow you; and that the so-called Baby Boom generation has spawned some of the worst symbols of selfishness and sanctified irrelevancy this nation has ever seen."
1,ALL ABOUT ECO-TERRORISM,"The new religion of the Northwest is definitely eco-terroism. Learn how to kill loggers and spitefully waste human life. Judy Bari and Earth First! are on the FBI list for Terrorism, worse than Ben Laden."
4,Awesome,Incredible makes the xbox look to worth having this mite be the most incredible thing I have ever seem in my life.
2,"not as pictured, short video, not enough information","Not so great.1. The plans are poorly photocopied spiral at home bound. They are not even first generation printed from a printer, the photos are very, very poor and hard to see. It would be better to have a .pdf provided so I can print my own book.2. Very very few construction photos. No step by step instructions. This is basically a set of drawings.3. The DVD is only 30 minutes long. Not nearly enough information to cover high quality construction, wood selection or tuning. No parts sources given.4. The Ad shows a book in color. NOTHING is in color!Yes, it is a hammered dulcimer plan, but nothing more.Very disappointing."
2,"Easy Watercolor Techniques (Art Lessons for Children, Vol.1)",I found this tape too expensive for the material contained. I felt the cost warrented more demonstrations of material/projects. I wouldn't order any additional tapes from this source.
4,Movies list,4 Horror Classics on 2 Discs - 1) House on Haunted Hill (Vincent Price) 2) The Bat (Vincent Price) 3) The Terror (Jack Nicholson) 4) Night of the Living Dead (Duane Jones)
1,Another disgrace from this label,"I had heard rumours that tracks on this album were to be transfered from vinyl....I did not believe them. but, oh yes they did. Although the ""Seattle"" album is quite crisp it is so evident that the ""Songs I Love"" album has been transfered from LP. Some tracks are muffled and you can quite clearly hear the clicks from the vinyl transfer.....an absolute disgrace in 2004.....an insult to the Como legacy....avoid like the plague!!!!"
4,"""Hey Dude"", Listen to this cassette and ""Be all ears""","Are you the type of person who ""stays up till all hours of the night watching ""the tube"" to learn new slang?"", ""YaWanna be cool""? Just ""give your brain a rest"" and listen to this wonderful teacher's aid cassette of American Slang. Leave the old ""stuff"" behind, and turn your class into a big ""bash"".Your students will love slang and will ""roll out the red carpet for YOU"""
4,best for people as us,"surely you can find many interesting slang which are quite different from the former dicionaries that you used to use.i am a chinese man,as china's entry into the wto,i have to learn english well,and this book helps me to master the true english and how to make boring leaning into a pleasant work.that sounds excellent ,you can have a try!"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"This is a delightful view of some of the Big Apple's waterfront. William Kornblum writes well, and I am pleased to meet the family, friends, and acquaintances of his journey. Having explored much of our city, and having studied many of the coasts from opposite shorelines, I nevertheless learned much from Kornblum's views from his catboat. I also enjoyed his flash-backs, particularly his days as a youth working at the Transit Mix dock. As another reader noted, the book has a few errors that should have been caught. The A train travels neither through The Bronx nor over Williamsburg Bridge (p. 91). In Red Hook, the parish school is within the Brooklyn diocese, not archdiocese (p. 122). When I find errors on topics I know well, I begin to worry that the publishing industry has a problem with fact-checking in non-fiction. Yet, I must say that this book is a thoroughly enjoyable meeting of humans, views, and story. I recommend this book as a gift."
2,Doesn't fit well,I don't use it as it just doesn't quite fit and you can't be struggling with access and changing settings on walks.
2,Disappointing,"I have had three of these units for a number of years and had no problems. One unit failed and was out of warranty. Since this USP is well priced I figured it was better to purchase a new one rather than spend shipping and repair costs on a 4+ year old unit. Well, the new unit failed within 24 hours and Amazon quickly shipped a replacement unit. I installed the replacement unit and powered it up. All was looking good, less than an hour later the unit failed. I powered it back on, and it shunt down in less than 5 minutes, powered on again, same thing. Requested another replacement and got an email back from Amazon indicating they would not attempt to replace it again and would be refunding the purchase price one the defective units were received. Not sure why Amazon would not replace it a second time. Other than that, they were great. In any case, very disappointed with the UPS even though I had good luck with these units in the past."
3,Great for a While,"I have used many different foil cutters over the years and this works far better than any other. Must be the four rotating cutting blades. However, after about six months the cutter just snapped in half. Thinking I must have done something, I purchased another with the same result. I noticed Screwpull has a new design for a cutter so I will give that product a try."
2,The foil cutter seems to have the disk fall off ist day.,I was very unhappy that the disk that cut the foil fell off in days.The last one lasted a least a year
2,Uni-tasker,"Personally, I think this product is a waste of money. Yes, it makes cutting the foil very easy, but it's still not worth it.If you don't mind throwing your money away on a uni-tasker, then go ahead and get this."
4,A handy gadget for wine drinkers,This little gadget cuts the foil away from the top of your bottle. It sure saves wear-and-tear on your finger nails.
2,Foil cutter,"Good, but not as good as the original. Sometimes the cutter wheels don't track together."
2,Will try something else this time,"The wheels started coming off after some months (of low usage). It's cheap, true, but I will try something else this time"
2,Gets Dull Fast,"These are not as good as they used to be. Must be a donwgrading of the streel in the cutting wheels. After a few uses, we found that the cutting wheels get dull and start to tear the foils. I like the new 6 wheel cutters better."
3,Works but flimsy,"This item is sharp and works well, but it's made of light-weight plastic and feels flimsy."
3,Works well. Eventually breaks.,"I've had this item for probably 15 years. It does a nice job of neatly cutting off the foil tops on all non-champagne wine bottles. Red, white, rose (does anyone actually drink rose?)Eventually, the plastic holding the little metal cutters started to crack from stress. I repaired the plastic after it cracked all the way through, and this lasted another 6-12 months. It's finally broken beyond repair. Seems like a design issue. Will be looking at the newer model."
4,Cut above the rest.,"Great product, I had a different foil cutter before. It had to be replaced twice. So far this one has exceeded my expectations."
1,Doesnt Work,I purchased the Monster iStudio Link a few days ago. Once I plugged it in and plugged my mic into it I began to record onto my Apple Powerbook. When I went to listen to what I had recorded after there was nothing. I turned up the volume all the way and i could hear barely hear it. I do not reccommend this to anyone.
5,Fabulous as a marinade.,"We've recently discovered Good Seasons dressings. They've always been so inexpensive that we figured they weren't any good, but they're wonderful. We've used nearly every variety as both a dressing AND a marinade. I especially like the Asian ginger flavor as a marinade. You can just pour some over chicken and let it sit for a half hour and then grill or bake. Yum! It's also an easy way to have a healthful side (salad) if you're cooking asian food."
1,Yuck!,"I respectfully have to disagree with the other two reviews. These olives taste disgusting to me. My local grocery store has an olive bar and they usually have nice, plump blue cheese stuffed olives. They were sold out so I bought a bottle of these and it certainly was a waste of $7. They were very crunchy, too salty, and the cheese was hard and lumpy. I ate one and threw the rest out."
5,Awesome beginner acoustic,"I started playing and learn my first time on this guitar. I have used it for 7 and 1/2 years now. Definitely one of the best decisions I have made. I recently bought a Breedlove D25SR. I am so glad that this acoustic helped me be a decent guitar player now. This a very durable and awesome guitar even for the price it is really just mind blowing. This should be a first choice for anyone starting to learn how to play an acoustic guitar. If you do get it, grab a feedback reducer and pop it into the sound hole because the bass on this acoustic is so nice that sometimes if it is not EQ-ed right, it'll feedback."
5,Nice Tone,"This is a beautiful guitar! I really love starting out on it! It's an inexpensive guitar that I'm not ashamed to take anywhere. It's beautiful. After owning this guitar for a little while now I can add more: the bridge is really high which makes playing a little painful also the hinges on the case just snapped in two not long after I got it. I was not rough on the case at all. However, it still closes and the clasps all still work so it's still usable as a storage case. Other than these two things I'm still very happy with my guitar. Still love the tone and it's a really pretty guitar. I'm going to get the bridge lowered and then it should be just perfect!"
5,Amore Amarige,"A reward for dog sitting, for a brother on a wine run to France. I hated it when he gave it to me.That has to be over 10 years ago. I would not dream of wearing another perfume.It is me, and I get so many compliments, I am totally in love with it. Thanks Givenchy,Thanks bro."
2,Too Small,"While I think Craig Morey is an excellent photographer, I was disappointed by this book. First of all, it was much too small. Given the price and the number of plates, I had expected to be a full sized (8x10's or so) or perhaps even an oversized book. Instead, the book itself is only 5.5 x 6.5 inches, and some of the photographs are only about 3.25 x 4 inches. I had to get out my photographer's loop to see some of the details. Secondly, many of the photographs here are duplicates from his earlier book ""Studio Nudes"" which was a full size book. The new pieces are very nice, but their small size makes it difficult to appreciate them. Sorry Craig -- I enjoy your work, but next time make the prints larger. The small size doesn't do it justice."
3,It used to keep me awake,"I fall asleep after taking one. Maybe I'll up it to two on vacation with a few double espresso's ^^.I've been using this off and on for years. I think my current pain medicine staves off the energy part, but it has quite a bit nutrients in it."
5,"Wonderful, especially for double batches","I bake double to tripple batches of bread and cookie doughs frequently, and this machine is perfect. It will also whip a pint of heavy cream in under a minute. I replaced a standard Kitchen aid mixer with this one, to increase power and capacity, and it was well worth it. One note, the website did not state whether or not the mixer comes with the three standard attachments, the wire whip, the flat beater and the dough hook. It does! They are all brushed stainless steel and hold up wonderfully in the dishwasher. Also, if you have trouble the first time assembling it, make sure that you attach the bowl to both pegs on each side AND the peg behind the bowl. The instructions are somewhat vague, so don't forget!"
3,"Good, but nothing like their first album","Though I always admire a band that expands their musical boundariers, and goes for a new sound, I think Switchblade Symphony overdid it a bit with this album. ""Witches"" is about the only enjoyable song on the whole CD, the rest a merely ""listenable"". Sounds more like dance music most of the time than goth. The lyrics are not as deep, and Tina Roots' vocals not as beautiful. My best advice is to go out and see for yourself, but don't expect to be better than Serpentine Gallery."
4,Something to cheer u up.,"When l first purchased this album, i hardly even touched it comparing it to Serpentine Gallery. Of course its quite different. However different doesnt really mean bad. It took some getting used to but now i love this cd just about as much as Serpentine Gallery. I find that it brings my spirits up. I think everyone should give it a chance."
4,"Different, Bizarree, but Enjoyable","This cd was introduced to me by a friend, who has been a Switchblade Symphony fan for awhile. This was the first cd I heard from this band. At first, it seemed quite strange, and took me awhile to get used to the vocables, ""erry sounds,"" and vocals of the band. But, this is a cd strickly for the open minded only. You'll have to play it a few times in order to really appreciate it - and if you have an open-mind, I think you will really enjoy this cd.Most like their first cd better, but after listening to it, I was not overly impressed with it. It was good, but the sound definition is not so clear. I feel that their second album, ""Bread & Jam for Frances,"" is definately a better choice."
4,Simply Delicious...,"I would have given it five stars, but there doesn't seem to be enough songs here... alot of filler for such a highly anticipated sequel... Alot of people are afraid of this one, growth has always been hard for the common people to swallow...especially in the highly-anal, goth scene...Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be Vampyres....but definitely, let them listen to this...good stuff..."
3,Tres Bizarre...,"I keep hearing about how this album does not compare in any fashion to ""Serpentine Gallery,"" from far too many people. But, I am afraid, that, for the most part, I have to agree. Even with past singles, covers and other such things, this album seems to have wandered far from the technically and aurally lush soundscape that one came to expect from Tina Root and Susan Wallace. It does stand on it's own, if you have not heard anything else by them, but if you have, then you are more than likely going to be biased in favor of their previous work. Tina Roots vocals have become sparse and unruly and Susan Wallace's keyboard and programming work on this album starts to sounds a little like a girl mad at her Barbie piano with a few 80's throwbacks here and there just to make things...er... interesting?"
1,Lacking in style and originality,"Switchblade Symphony's first album was carried along by simple, melodic music and a great voice. It soothed the listener and was very good gothic if not terribly talented musically, voice notwithstanding. Their second attempt adds bad, almost hip hop or techno beats and kills the gothic vibe entirely...the voice still soars but it does not mix with the music well. I'm of the opinion that the singer should go solo and drop the keyboardist and the rest of the band...since her voice is now the only saving grace. This album lacks in style, grace, talent and substance."
1,SOMEONE TEACH THIS GIRL HOW TO USE HER TALENT,"OK. I have to say Switchblade Symphony has potential. That is about it. Other than that, the album is absolutely atrocious. The singer has a beautiful voice -but she also evidently is either really young or inexperienced/immature_THERE IS NO CONTENT WHATSOEVER TO THIS MUSIC> basically, she sings stupid, juvenile lyrics to an underdeveloped melody- but with a beautiful voice. DONT WASTE your money. This is produced at the level of eigth-grade 'goths'. INSECT is the only decent song on the album."
3,Brainticket - 'Adventure' (Cleopatra),"Originally released upon a small private label in 1980, 'Adventure' is similar to their 'Voyage' effort (see my review). This later day Brainticket is okay. The 'main' lp portion contains two tracks, ""Adventure, Pt. 1"" and ""Adventure, Pt. 2"" of which neither did all that much for me. However, like the 'Voyage' CD, there's 25 minutes of bonus cuts that REALLY do make this reissue worthwhile. Totally dug the head-tripper ""Machinery"", ""3 Worlds"" and the improvised ""Robotika"" as all three are good. Line-up is: Joel Vandroogenbroeck - flute & keyboards, Hans Deyssenroth - moog, Barney Palm - drums and Wilhelm Seefeldt - keyboards. Overall,I would say that 'Adventure' is more of an obscure experimental piece of work. If you like the other Brainticket releases, you MIGHT enjoy this. Should appeal to fans of Toad, Cluster, Neu! and possible Can."
4,Great for someone who already knows the basic techinques.,I bought this book to add to my collection. It wasn't my first purchase but after borrowing it from someone I had to have one. Great photos and great information! This book has given me many ideas for various projects!
2,Nothing special.,I'll try to be short. Expected sth special but was totally disappointed. Mixes are slow and really boring; too much bass used ruins the tracks in my opinion. Anyway the only good mixes i like to play is the Sizequeen Mix (Rauhofer + Airmale) and the Rooster & Peralta Mix. Why only 2 stars? THE BEST MIX of this song IS NOT ON THE CDS!!! It's on CD1 of Peter Rauhofer - Live @ Roxy 4!!! Buy that instead of this crap.
3,in search of the day to day life,"The earlier review by Brian R. stated it perfectly. This should have been a book that you couldn't put down... the kind of book that compels you to turn the page. And while Karl Maier deserves credit for providing a look at the political turmoil and chess games of Nigeria (espeically in the 1990s), I was itching for a sense of the day-to-day life of the Nigerians. This is still a book that deserves to be read. The author has faced a monumental task of trying to get a handle on Nigeria but, like the leaders of the last 30+ years have shown, this is an elusive task."
2,A disappointing book,"After reading In the Footspets of Mr.Kurtz by Michela Wrong I was looking for a book just as good about Nigeria. ""This house has fallen"" clearly is not it. Karl Mayer provides no clear background to Nigeria's history and keeps shuffling through names and dates with no clear purpose. It goes to Karls credit however that he helps putting the blame for Nigeria's problems where it should lie, in its own leaders."
3,Not a bad primer on a torn country,"An interesting journey through a dangerous country.Perhaps too much time is spent interviewing religious and political zealots and kooks who simply spout their own personal agendas in the book, or vent observations already obvious to the reader, and rarely offer true solutions. I would have rather read more of the author's personal experiences and conclusions about Nigeria.Overall, not a bad effort and an important book for those who want to learn more about why Africa is such a mess."
4,"A titilating account from an ""outsider""","This was a thrilling account of Nigeria's contemporary history. Coming from an ""outsider"", one observes an intrinsic relative objectivity. It does not only fill in the blanks for Nigerians in the Diaspora, it also complements, yes corrects the observer accounts around."
1,Awful,"I sampled it while killing time in a gift shop in one of Las Vegas hotels. I think I can safely say that one of the most disgusting perfumes I've encountered. Not sure how to describe it-stale lemonade with a whiff of mothballs? Yes, I think that's close enough. Not good, not good at all."
1,Disappointing publication quality,"As another reviewer noted, not all the drawings involve spanking. The biggest disappointment, though, is the drawings themselves. Although the cover is in color, all the drawings inside are black and white, but not even with the crispness of ink. They are all printed as though drawn in soft pencil, with low contrast. Visually this art book is a huge disappointment."
3,Here it is...,"Ok, this was ok, however I like a little more mixture of men and women. not just women."
5,Color Her Country,"Very good album by the first black female singer to appear on the Grand Ole Opry. Released in 1970, this album contained the singles ""Color Him Father"" & ""Bad Case Of The Blues"" (where Linda yodels). ""Before The Next Teardrop Falls"" was recorded & released as a single by Linda before Freddy Fender had a hit with it. Also featured are songs previously recorded by popular labelmate Jeannie C. Riley: ""The Wedding Cake"", ""I Almost Called Your Name"", & ""There Never Was A Time"". Their styles are so different & unique they can't really be compared. The cover photo is used twice, on the front & back, & features a ladder (of all things) as a prop & is too dark & not very flattering. Unfortunately, there were no follow up releases from Linda on Plantation Records & one wonders if she was used as a curiosity and/or novelty act by them to garner sales at that time. It's a shame because she has a fine voice!!"
5,Great behind the scenes view....,This documentary really gave a good view of behind the scenes of how Jon Trenge ticks. It gave good inside view of his emotions that you didn't see when he was wrestling in college. I have a new found respect and understanding of him as a person now. It's a must see for wrestling fans.
5,Fun cooking,"I have several stoneware baking dishes, however all of them are too large for making a meal for two, so I was looking for a smaller unit. The Reco International Vegetable Baker is PERFECT. It fits exactly into my toaster oven, and with 10 minutes' preparation and 50 minutes in the oven, a most delectable meal for two, including grains and veggies, is ready for our enjoyment. The baker is easy to clean and to handle, and I am delighted."
4,"Glad I tried it, but","Glad I tried it, but I cant tell if soaking it makes any difference at all.. Seems like the water left on the VEG after washing would do the same trick (but I dont really know; perhaps the claim is that the water is released over time from the clay).. The VEG do come out great, and it is very easy to clean (I simply rinse with water and it seems to be enough).. Its a bit of a pain to worry about it breaking from temperature changes (I glean from the directions it is more prone to such breakage than other cookware).. Difficult to handle when hot because the lid doesnt have a handle that works well with oven mitts.. Also takes up a lot of space(I am trying to use a toaster oven and roast garlic too, so space is at a premium).. I do love the organic feel of using the clay.. It is pretty enough so my girlfriend will allow it to be used on display when not in use (otherwise every damn thing goes into the cabinets somewhere)..bobbler"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS MANUFACTURER,"See customer images. Both images are for the same unit. I didn't think this was a pattern and expected that the replacement would have no damage, so didn't take pictures of the original unit. The product was chipped in several places on the inside rim of the lower half - some of them were big enough to put me off. I had paid for a new product. I asked Amazon for replacement and sent this one back. Amazon promptly sent a replacment. The replacement had more chipping away on the inside rim than the previous one. It looks like all of these units are defective and probably why they are included in 4-for-3 promotion. Do not buy this product. I would go as far as saying, this company does not do any quality control and and can't expect that any of its other eathernware products are in pristine condition either. Bad experience. Amazon should not be selling such defective products."
3,Dressy belt,"The size wasn't listed for this belt and one size doesn't fit all. It was almost too tight for my comfort, but maybe that is the ""corset"" meaning. Over velour skirt and blouse a 34 inch would probably be maximum comfort for me. 35 to 36 is probably the limit of stretch in this belt. The ""Patent Leather"" didn't appear to be anything other than shiny plastic. It scratched when I removed the tag. I kept the belt since the price was cheap and I can always use it on a costume."
3,One of at least three books you'll need.,"Advantages of this book:1. Verbal questions are pretty similar to GMAT.2. Good variety of questions in verbal and quantitative3. Exhaustive list of topics for the AWADisadvantages:1. Quantitative problems are way easier than the actual GMAT.2. Only two full length tests downloadable from the GMAC website.3.Inadequate review for the quantitative section, no review at all for the verbal section.I would strongly suggest getting the Princeton Review book and CD, as well as the Kaplan book and CD. Solving plenty of practice tests is definitely very helpful.My scores on the Princeton review tests - 720,740,740,720My scores on the powerprep tests - 720, 750My scores on the Kaplan tests - 620,600,640,640My actual GMAT score - 770Don't freak out if you score low on the Kaplan tests, but they are great practice as they are way harder than the actual GMAT.Good luck!"
1,Horrible Book,"If you have been out of school for a while and are certain to need a real refresher course, do not buy this book.This book presumes that you have a strong grounding in the required math principles to perform well on the exam. You are provided with a lousy primer in an attempt to refresh your memory.The questions in this book are excellent, but they are all available for free when you register for the test. Therefore, don't waste your money."
2,Snoozefest for a college student,"Because I am getting certified to teach, I had to read Perry for a couple of college classes. While I recognize his importance to developmental theories (hence the 2 stars), I have to say that the book was dry, repetitious, sexist, and outright dull. I got no more from the book than I did from the handout my professor prepared, and the handout took less time to read. I'd say the worst part of reading Perry was the fact that he quoted verbatim what the students said, including every um, uh, ah, well, etc. Unless your looking to catch up on some sleep, find yourself a handout..."
3,a murderer on the loose.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Based on a true story, Vengeance is Mine which was released in Japan as ""Fukush suruwa wareniari"" is about serial killer on the from police. The killer later visits a brothel and begins a relationship with one of the women there.The film was directed by famed Japanese director Shohei Imamura.The special features are a theatrical and teaser trailer and an interview with Imamura.The film is well made but the subject matter is for mature audiences."
2,Not much mystery,"I haven't read Craig Thomas in a while, but I remember liking some of his other books - Sea Leopard, Firefox Down, Hooded Crow, Lions Den. I don't remember the others but this one really had little mystery. You know the villians and good guys from the outset; after that its just turning pages to see what happens."
4,Very nice necklace,I bought this necklace as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law. I tried them on just to make sure they would look nice and I was pleasantly surprised. They are a nice weight and look like a nice fashion piece. I wouldn't mind having a set in my collection.
4,Nice Slick Covers,"I hesitated before buying this harp because I was unsure of the covers. Rest assured they feel good on the lips and work very well.Mine was airtight and responsive out of the box, with only a slight adjustment needed for one reed. Pretty good!The corners are a bit sharp, but a touch of sanding takes the edge off that.It comes in a very nice plastic box. It closes with a solid click and will not pop open accidently. It's also vented through the bottom. That's either good or bad, depending on how you look at things. On one hand, it allows air circulation, permitting the harp to dry out if put away damp. On the other hand, it will permit some crud to get in if you habitually carry it around in your pocket.The Pro Harp is mid-range in Hohner's modular system series (MS series). It has a plastic comb and the dividers are comfortable. The reed plates are replaceable, and the harmonica is built so as to be easy to disassemble for maintenance. You'll need a posidrive #1 for the screws."
1,ummm - where is the mystery?,"You may think that you're buying a book of mystery stories, but no, the real mystery is why most of these stories in this volume aren't mysteries at all. If they had labeled this ""Crime Fiction With No Mystery"", then that would be more honest. Most of the stories in this volume have no real hidden element that keeps you guessing. Sure, there may be some good social commentary or character development here and there, but if I really wanted that stuff I wouldn't have picked up a book labeled ""Mystery Stories""."
2,Not really mysterious,"Half of these stories were not even traditional mysteries at all: one was set in the civil war, one was more like a mainstream short story. And these were the better ones! One was a ripoff of Poe's Casque of Amontillado, while the lead story, bet on red, was cliched. Leave it to a fool like Nelson DeMille to pick some really bad stories. The only really good one was Steven Kings' semi-supernatural spine tingler, and that was more for the creepy language and timing he possesses, than for any original story ideas. Save your money."
2,"unlikable characters; coarse, crude","Sorry, this was one of the worst books I've read. I found the characters to be unlikeable. The characters' speech and actions were coarse and crude, and the plot pretty unlikely. It is clear that the author doesn't know her way around horses and the racing scene, quarterhorse or Thoroughbred. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
4,showdown,this book was definitely a fun read...It was a little bit Jackie Collins but very orignial...Enjoyed the racetrack setting and even learned a few things about racing and race horses....Definitely recommend.....
2,WRITER NEEDS MORE POLISH,"I only got half way through this book! That says alot for me when the book doesn't flow or have me not care about any of the characters or what happened to them.Ms. Bagshawe needs more polish and more experience as a writer, and give her characters more depth. I also couldn't understand why Molly would want to be a Quarterhorse jockey, but then maybe I can with here living in England and breaking a male tradition is hard."
2,"So Drawn Out, Boring, and Predictable","Alright, already.....from the very beginning I knew where this book was going and unfortunately Bagshawe took 472 pages to get me there. I was expecting a great read after just finishing her novel ""Adored"", which I adored!! I'm not giving up on Bagshawe yet, though, and will attempt another of her books. Her writing style is comfortable and it's an easy read, but the plot developed after just a few chapters and the rest just drudged along a predictable course."
4,I liked it but...,"I loved this book, much like Adored, however I thought it resembled Adored too much.If you haven't read Adored, then you're good to go. If you have, then it is the same plot with horses instead of glam. But I still loved it!"
5,Awaken to the Real World,"If you are unfamiliar with Channelled books, then please don't be put off. Channelling is simply a term used to describe a person who is able to BRING THROUGH information(either in a Trance, or Conscious State)from other Dimensions.In the case of this book, the Master ST GERMAIN(who lived on this Plane a few Centuries ago), offers his viewpoints on Earth. He starts right at the beginning, and takes us journeying across time. Atlantis, Egypt, India, and the West. Lots of amazing details are revealed on where we came from, and why.This is not just an Ancient History book however, as ST GERMAIN gives us a glimpse into our Future, and how we CREATE it. Be prepared for many suprises, and to have your outlook on Life TRANSFORMED. Allow the words to fill your Heart with wonder, and joy, and learn to Live with genuine purpose.Read and ABSORB, the wisdom of the Ages. You will not be disappointed."
3,"early clapton ""remixed""","This CD takes very early Eric Clapton and remixes it by adding extra percussion and organ to it decades later. The original recordings are with the Yardbirds, the Bluesbreakers, and duets with Jimmy Page. The added instruments are nice, but ingenuine. It sounds canned because that's exactly what it is. Search out the original old Clapton recordings. I recommend the deluxe edition of the classic Bluesbreakers album; it has most of them on there without the extras."
3,Fast Delivery!!..But Dissapointed,I loved that i got my product quickly but was dissapointed because it did not smell like cotton candy it smelled like strawberries instead. not that it smelled bad but i ordered cotton candy!! and also the scent dosent last very long on you skin. works well when you use it as shaving lotion tho lol.. but i will not be ordering this again..
3,Smells great - high shipping cost.,I fell in love with this scent ages ago. I normally wear very upscale scents like Vera Wang and Dolce & Gabbana however this scent is one of my favorites. It's cheap and lasts through out the day. My 8 year old daughter also loves this scent. I also recommend the spray.
5,smells AMAZING,"I love love love this body wash. It smells so good you want to drink it. It doesn't dry out my skin, it gets me clean and I actually smell like it when i get out of the shower, unlike most body washes. I would definitely recommend this body wash."
3,wanted to like this but ...,"I typically like this genre of music but the singer sings in a whiney high register. When he isnt doing that he is whispering or worse, there's a studio treble-filter added to his voice (god knows why). At times he sounds like John Lennon but Lennon was a better singer. He's trying his best but his singing is uniformly poor. There's great and often inventive instrumental arrangments thruout and the band deserves plenty of recognition for that."
1,Another One,"Another book using self centered literalism to reach their conclusions. I recommend ""Late Great Planet Church"" dvd if you are interested in hearing what others have to say about this kind of approach to scripture.."
4,So far so good,"I have not watched them all yet so its hard to give it a 5 star rating, but so far so good!"
5,Great collection !!,These are all classic musicals and I was glad I could get them on DVD. Had some on VHS but when I saw them listed I jumped at the chance. Got a real good deal too ! Amazon always seems to come through. They are a really good store to do business with. Hope they stay true to their present way of doing business.
5,Great Musicals,These 6 movies are wonderful for every collection. The compact case and individual box for each movie keeps them neat and easy to find on the shelf.
5,What a Wonderful Set!!!,Great sing-along opportunities with this set. You can't go wrong getting this set if you like any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein movies.
1,Pure Drivel,"Drivel at its finest. The author not only lacks an entertaining writing style, but also seems to misunderstand exactly what a ""casebook of criticism"" should entail (ideally it would be critical)."
3,Brainticket - 'Voyage' (Purple Pyramid / Cleopatra),"I believe this was the band's fourth lp, originally released in 1982. The first two tracks run over eighteen minutes each, obviously making each tune take up an entire lp side. ""Voyage,Part 1"" is okay, but I think I like ""Voyage,Part 2"" a bit better. Brainticket founder Joel Vandroogenbroeck states in the CD's liner notes the band, including drummer Barney Palm got together after a lengthy break in the studio with NO song arrangements whatsoever. They apparently just made everything up as they went along. There aren't a lot of artists that can successfully do that. I always appreciate seeing these CD reissues tagging on bonus cuts. Personally, I dug the three bonus tracks better than I did the 'original' album. ""Skyline Analog 1970"" is quite tripping and so is ""Nebula"". ""Underworld Paths"" appears to be more laid back. Might appeal to some fans of Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Ash Ra Tempel and Gong."
2,Disappointed,"I am a career medic. I have close to 20 years in the business. I was looking for this book to bring to light a medic's point of view regarding the war in Iraq. I truly wish I had tried another book. This one was written on about an 8th grade level. Plus the chapters are short, sometimes only 2 pages long, but no longer than 8. While 6 of the 104 page book were direct quotes of eulogies and obituaries and prayers, 10 of them are taken up with pictures. This is all well and good, but it only leaves 88 pages of content. This combined with the extremely short chapters leaves the story lacking of any depth. I got her emotion and thoughts of whatever the current situation was, but other than that there was no depth. It seems as though this book was a direct reprint of her diary.That being said, please don't think for a minute that I am not appreciative of her service to this country. I AM! Just hope that she was/is a better medic than author."
4,It is an excellent book for international lawyers,"This book contains a concise explanation of every day problems regarding foreign transactions, together with an explanation of the Common law system specially in United States, this book concentrates pertinent cases for each of the subjects explained in it."
4,More than I expected,"The reading is thoroughly informatory though at times may seem ""dry."" Cases and chapter conclusions and summaries give clear explanations and apply concepts well in my opinion."
4,Very well written and easy to understand,"Despite that the book is very expensive and a required text book for college, I think it is an excellent book. It is informative and easy to read. The author made the information interesting and kept me engaged. If I didn't need the money (from reselling it), I would keep it as a reference guide."
4,Use the wrap ups for fun!,"This book does not come with the ""wrap up"" manipulative. These (and the book) are available from an Usborn Book distributor, or a Home School Curriculum store. They are an awesome way to learn! You should be able to search for an Usborn distributor on the internet. I just ordered the book and wrap ups from a friend, and haven't received the book yet. Looks interesting, though."
5,Fascinating Science,"The title is self-explanatory, and don't sniff and turn away from this one. (Pardon the pun.) It makes for fascinating reading even for the most fastidious reader. Although her touch is light, and it's impossible to read the book without grinning, Susan never goes for the cheap shot. She chuckles without smirking. Chapter headings include: Useful Poop, History of the Toilet Parts 1 and 2, Dung Dispatch, and Poop Power. Having trouble getting third or fourth graders to read a book? Put this one on the table and see how long it takes before a group of kids (probably boys) are gathered around absorbing scientific information."
1,Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This may be funny to those, ""play in the mud"" little boys who think anything gross is funny, but in general, who on earth would want to read about poop? It's discusting!I do not think this book would be an appropiate gift to get anyone!"
5,nice,"Got this as a gift for a friend who's a new parent. And got myself a copy too. Sweet.Only quibble is that the Amazon packaging was a bit lacking. The book was packed without any padding, along with a bunch of other books. I opened the box with a key and ended up cutting a bit of the cover."
5,Love Poop,"If your kids enjoy silly, humorous conversation about potty stuff than this book is for you. My daughter who was 7 at the time I bought this. She ate the book up. She still has me read parts of it to her today 2 years later.Can't get enough info about the facts of our bodies."
5,This is a great cd !!!!!!!!!!!!,The smooth sound coming from the b3 organ was awesome! This is a must cd for all smooth and traditional jazz lovers. You can hear the passion Mel put into this cd with the help of Ronny Jordan. Keep it coming.
2,"Good for one PC, not useful for a network","I failed to read the description deeply enough and bought this before I figured out that it doesn't support PPPoE, which is used by most DSL providers. This is not a problem if you have one Windows box, because you can just run a software PPPoE client and all's well.However, if you have more than one device (e.g. your VoIP phone, or other computers), this will probably not work for you. I'm not sure about PPPoE software for Macintoshes, check for yourself."
3,"Star Trek: The Next Generation ""Ethics""","Worf is severely injured following an accident, and loses the ability to walk. Dr. Crusher tells him his condition may be permanent, and suggests treatments that could could restore much, but not all, of his mobility. However, Worf is not pleased at that, and considers his own remedy for his disability, until a doctor comes aboard the Enterprise hoping to try out an experimental but risky medical procedure that could restore virtually all his mobility. After conferring with his son about his situation, Worf decides to undergo the procedure, but will he come out of it alive? I like this episode because it's a story about Klingon rituals and what Klingons traditionally do when they're paralyzed."
4,good review,This is a good way for those who have a basic knowledge of Biblical Hebrew to keep up with it and learn a few more things.
3,"If you like whining, you'll love these!","The stories in the Gigi movies are fantastic. My girls (ages 4 and 2) think they're fun and the lessons are excellent.For some reason, though, the people who cast the voices decided that Gigi needed to be played by an older girl (probably a teenager). But to sound young, she whines. And whines and whines.For someone who is trying to teach her daughters to talk with ""nice voices,"" Gigi's whiny voice is hard to handle. If that doesn't bother you, these are great movies!"
1,needs more steps then this..,"the idea of the book is great and it is very easy to read and understand.But, it contains lots of errors and broken code. It can be very frustrating when the code you typed in exactly does not work and cant figure out why.I feel the publisher should have invested in more proofreaders and code checkers. I switched to O'reilly's javascript the definitve guide and its cook book. Its was a lot tougher to get through but in the long run was a better choice."
5,Keeps getting better,I can't wait for this dvd to come out. the most I know about it is that the title of each episode if there are indeed four on this disc are as follows:1.Crime and punishment of the Kiss2.First date at the seaside3.Doumyouji Tsubaki comes home!4.Love's tempest! banished from schoolWe get to see Tsukasa's sister and Rui get's punched in the face by Tsukasa That's reason enough to buy it.
3,"I enjoyed this book, but....","I really enjoyed this book, but I am not sure why. I have always been a fan of Ms. O'Day-Flannery and she continues to impress me with her writing. The reader can always expect a chuckle when reading the mishaps of her time travelers. This book was a quick read with little thought or mystery. I thought that Ms. O'Day-Flannery could have gone more in-depth on many things she just touched on in her book. There were so many avenues that she pointed to but never really went down. (I.E the suffrage movement, the issue of slavery, how Kelly fit into this era) However I bow to her expertise. All in all it was a good book but I wasn't sure of the point. Like enjoying a meal, but not leaving the table full."
1,Read her other ones instead,"I've been reading Constance O'Day-Flannery's books for a while now, and I always pick up every new one. But this one is a major disappointment! The characters are flat, too nicey-nice, and it's just really boring. I used to believe in the romance in her novels, but, in her last three or four, she's gotten too New Agey (and I say this as a native Californian) and has forgotten the basic principles of romance. Try her earlier ones instead, especially ""Once in a Lifetime,"" which is really good."
4,Great pans,Nonstick with non-heating handles. Thicker than most pans and stand up to farberware name. Love the easy clean-up!
2,Expected a little more than I got,"All I wanted was a not too expensive pan to make omelets that wouldn't stick. I followed the manufacturer's directions for care and the very FIRST omelet stuck completely. The second worked better after using a non-stick spray. If I wanted to use the spray, I could have stuck(no pun intended) with my old pan. I should have saved my pennies and gotten a known quality item."
2,Strong sea smell,"Was hoping this would be as tasty as the tofu-spinach soup but alas, no. Just too much ""smell"" of the sea overwhelming the flavor of the broth. Will not purchase again."
1,Do not buy this book,"Usually, I love her books. Not this one. It is hard to understand, does not provide enough examples in relating HTML to CSS and does little to reconcile the difference.""Creating a Web Page in HTML: Visual Quick Project"" is much better."
5,BEST BOOK TO PICK-UP FOR WEB SITE BUILDING,"This book is A-ma-ZING...... It teaches you everything that you need to know to get started building, the whole process. It just breaks everything down into smaller bits of information. I know that with time, because of this book, my Web site skills will be all that I hoped for. It's definitely a go-to book for how to do anything."
4,A code book,This is the type of book you buy to learn html code. It's pretty thorough but I don't know much about code. I work in Dreamweaver. It does the code for me. ;)
5,"HTML, XHTML, and CSS Guide",This book arrived quick and in new condition. It has been a real help for my class at school this semester (and WAY less expensive than if I had bought it at the school bookstore)...Thanks!
4,Direct simple book,"Direct simple book, easy to get started, altough it covers a lot of subjects. It references the differences between HTML and XHTML."
1,If you want something easy to understand - dont' buy this book,"I read this book because I had to for my class, but I hated it. It's hard to understand, her way of describing how to do something isn't in an easy to follow flow - it jumps around a lot. I bought the Head First HTML & XHTML with CSS and that helped me understand how to do something and why. If you are a visual learner like me, don't buy this book! Find one that has more visual examples and a clear way of describing how to do things."
3,Since 14th December 2007 that I purchased this book it has not been delivered as promised.,"It is very disappointing and discouraging that since 14th December 2007, that I bought this book and paid for it including posting charges I have not seen the book. The enthusiasm and trust with which I ordered and paid for this book has vanished into the thin air; the program I'm doing that necessitated that book is coming to an end soon, AMAZON! AMAZON!! AMAZON!!! BUT WHY?"
4,learning to do HTML for dummies,"Ok, I must admit I haven't even cracked this book. I am relying on everyone else's reviews that say that it is easy to follow this book. I am not a computer junkie, although I'm not terrible with basic commands on the computer, and I'm not a complete dummy. But boy do I feel like one sometimes, and I'm hoping that when I get a chance, I will learn to do HTML finally. I'd like to create a webpage in the future that will help in future career/hobby endeavours. I'm sure this book will help me out, if it's as good as everybody says it is."
3,Grad class guide,"I liked the way the book was laid out b/c it had actual screen images and explanations below them. It broke things down into steps. However, sometimes the mix of CSS and XHTML got to be too much within the same pages."
2,Fails to provide clear CSS examples.,"HTML, XHTML are explained in a basic way. Fails to provide clear CSS examples."
1,didn't like the book,"I had to buy this book for a class, so had no choice. I do not like the way this book presents information, it is too difficult to find the bits of information you need to code and style html. I have also found contradictions in information presented in this book and the correct coding needed to pass xhtml strict. This book presents information that is poorly organized, and the author is too chatty about his own opinions and thinking in a way that has nothing to do with learning html."
2,Read the 1-3 ratings before buying,I bought this book because of all of the high ratings. I find the format very hard to follow and wish I had paid more attention to the low rating reviews. I want to buy another book but don't know what to buy now since this one had such high ratings.
5,"HTML, XHTML & CSS",This is a great book for learning the basics for building web sites. I find the instructions and explanations very clear and easy to understand.
3,Reference not Guide,"Definitely more of a reference than a guide. I tried to go cover to cover on this to inundate myself with all the CSS knowledge, but I never made it through. That's rare for me. I still use it every now and then though as a reference."
2,learning HTML,"I am a student at the local community college so I am going through this book slowly and doing the exercises.The book could be better.At one point I had to create a br so that two lines of text could be indented.Even though, the exact text was not in the book, it suggested that I use tag to do the job. It didn't. I had to ask the head of the department to help and it took her 1/2 hour to debug. It didn't mention the tag to use, which finally solved the problem. However, the blockquote tag got almost a full page where the pre tag got one sentence. No wonder it was overlooked.I haven't finished the book yet, but based on the first 5 chapters, I feel that it could be better and go into more detail."
4,The book is good,the book it self was great learned a lot but the binding is well dysfunctional (the book is falling apart) guess you get what you pay forbut I can't complane about the contents
3,"Does the job, mostly","This lock fits fine and bolts right up as advertised, when one of the mounting bolts is cut as mentioned in the included directions. The lock tumbler really fights back when trying to insert the key but rotates nicely when the key is finally jammed into place. Lube doesn't help get the key into the lock. Mine might not be typical. The function of the lock can be defeated fairly readily with a long scrwedriver or small crowbar so as far as locks go, it is much more of a deterrent than a safeguard."
5,Prose and Cons,"I was lent a copy of this book from a member of Robert Doherty's family. I felt pressured to read it quickly because of others, anxiously awaiting their turn. I read it in one day and got lost in old America. The humanity, with it's grifts and postulations, seems so familiar but the setting and the modes of living are charmingly historical. I enjoyed the study of how influential the place and the time were in determining the mentality of the people in the story. The mountain and it's valley provided delightful imagery to accompany great tales and parables.The author is clever and reveals a refreshingly sinister sense of humor. I highly recomend this book. I'm purchasing my own copy and one for my mother."
3,A Funky Party!,Go see The Baboons for a funky party! I see them play Tobacco Road in Miami and love the sultry girl on microphone. The album needs more photos or multi-media video to convey how [hot] the girl singing is. ....
3,Nice lamp,"This lamp is made on a exeptional measure, hard to find. Its not sturdy, the body is weak, but its ok to me. The only cons : the golden color is very yellow......"
1,"Inacceptable, awful",I bought a book from this seller but I have never received it ! I contacted them and wrote 3 letters (through Amazon) asking the reason and claiming non delivery of the book but the seller don't care to the letters and has not replied to me ! I feel their conduct is not respectful. Any way after about one month of transaction I have not yet received neither the book nor any answer about it !
2,The old standard--but outdated,"This book is still used a great deal in law schools, but there are better casebooks now with modern, more interesting cases and more thoughtful analysis. Instead, try Goldberg, Sebok and Zipursky, Tort Law: Responsibilities and Redress."
3,Okay but you'll also want some study aids,"Case books have a difficult time getting respect, because they have to include the opinions written by the different judges for the different cases. So, you're dealing with many, many writers, and unfortunately, judges aren't known for their entertaining, flowery prose.So, the ""authors"" of a casebook really only get to throw in a few tidbits about the relevant law in-between a lot of badly written, lengthy legalese. I'm betting that they're limited on how much they can write in-between the case opinions by their publishers.That said, this is a pretty decent casebook. Buy it only if you have to. If you have access to Lexis/Nexis or WestLaw, etc., you can always just look up and read the cases online & save the cost of the textbook.To really understand Torts, I suggest getting a study aid like Examples & Explanations, which I think is put out by Lexis press or the Professor Series by Gilberts. The Finals series are good, too."
5,The greatest album ever made?,"I eat,sleep,drink InSoc.I have had the great fortune of chatting with Kurt Harland on ICQ and his thoughts and philosophies really come through on this cd.Yeah it's darker than the others but hey notice how the previous three (four if you count the white & black album) had dark lyrics but upbeat music?Now there are dark lyrics and dark music but hey this is the real world cowboy.This cd pulls no punches in it's view of a world gone dysfunctional my fave tracks are ""Closing In"" the kick butt song of all kick butt songs,""Empty"" we've all felt this way sometimes,""On The Outside"" a good view of our society and ""White Roses"" whihc i posted the lyrics to on Excite forums when asked what song really got onto our emotions (after that i had people asking for copies).Good job Kurt you never fail to impress."
3,a departure from the norm,"well, this was not what i expected. after listening to it a few times i warmed up to it a bit. reveals a darker side to insoc music, but still clever and likeable if you're in the mood. i still much prefer the old-style of ""hack"" and ""p&l inc"". c'mon kurt! you can do something up-beat... give us more of what we really like."
2,Blindsided!,"I just wish I had read some reviews before buying this cd. But then again, with many of you giving this cd four or five stars, I might have been persuaded to buy it anyhow. I don't like this cd at all. I shouldn't have to coerce myself into liking this cd, especially with so much other good music out there to listen to. Information Society captivated me with their first three releases, and then we (or atleast I) was blindsided with this miserable cd full of whimpering and whining. The first track is actually not so bad, once it gets going, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
1,"If you like In Soc, DON'T BUY THIS!","Having been a fan since the inception of In Soc, I waited through all the delays of production for this CD to be released. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed at what I heard. No identifiable melody lines, dark and gothic. Definately not In Soc stuff."
1,"Not real InfoSoc, should have been a 'side project'.",I love InfoSoc.This album is very uncharistic of InfoSoc.This albim... Blows. Completely. Not 1 track is really any good.It sucks. Don't buy it. Whoever called this a masterpiece has absolutely no taste in music or any other form of art.
1,this just doesn't work,"Oh, boo hoo, Kurt. I like Front 242, Front Line Assembly, NiN, and I understand the formula he was trying to achieve here. But the whining, self-indulgent lyrics and poor execution of a mature genre just don't cut it here. One or two tracks are refreshingly reminiscent of the off-cuts on Hack, but other than that, INSOC is pretty much dead here. I try to be open-minded, I tried to listen with an open ear, but this just doesn't work. Its construction is poor; an engineering failure and a mixing disaster with no real content or message to boot. I'm reminded of Gore's fluffy tripe that he tried away from Depeche Mode; you can have a good voice, super brains and musical talent, but without the soul of the rest of your group, you might as well be the next garage band with a half-baked demo."
1,Be Afraid,"I am a big fan of the previous three albums, but this one is too eccentric for me. I was prepared for it to be different because of the member changes, but I was still surprised at how amazingly bad it turned out to be. I really tried to like it, but I'm afraid I'll have to use it as a drink coaster."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have always enjoyed the Information Society albums. I found some of the keyboard programming brilliant. They created very original material using samples and keyboards. In fact, some of their music inspired me to become a keyboard programmer and remixer. I was very excited to hear of a new IS record but when I finally received a copy, I was very disappointed with the results. I'm not going to say anything bad about the album; I just don't recommend it to anyone looking for that classic IS sound."
3,Not bad,"This is a good CD. Its not for die hard IS fans. If you like Front242 and later Tangerine Dream relases you'll love this. Its an album with a thought-like quality, I dont think you'll waste your time by listening."
2,Huh?,"THIS is InSoc? Here's a hint, Kurt: If I wanted to listen to (badly done) Front 242, I'd pick up one of their CDs. I can't figure out what they were trying to accomplish here. If Kurt wanted to release a dark, depressing album, at least he could have done it in his own name and not call it Information Society. But instead he decides to alienate half his fans (if not more) by making a complete departure from his trademark style. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against gothy techno kind of stuff. And this album does bear a slight passing resemblance to the first (apparently unofficial) InSoc release... the one with the giant ""I"" on it. But for a band that is constantly hovering on the edge of obscurity, this was a bad move. I am begging you, please bring back the techno/synth happy stuff and the clever samples for the next album (if there IS a next one!), okay Kurt? This stuff is just depressing."
5,This aint your parents InSoc,"This cd is a major departure from the pop songs, that are associated with this band.This cd feature dark gothic like songs and lyrics. It combines the samples that they are known for mixed with lush music and surperb vocals. I highly recomend."
4,Brooding darkness o'ercomes once happy band,"""Don't Be Afraid"", Information Society's newest release is one of the coolest albums I have heard for a while. Information Society's prior stuff consisted of catchy and highly danceable tunez. I must congratulate Kurt Harland on first and foremost being an artist. Artists experiment with their art form. My wife has always been into the pop and pop country scene. She heard the first several songs on this CD and she says "" I like old IS better!"" The heck with that! There is a variety of sound and feeling on this new CD. There is some darkness, some drama, and always something new going on. And, as always, the songs(or at least a majority of them) are still highly danceable. An extra delight is the InfoSoc data CD for those who own a computer to look at various and sundry artwork, text, sounds, programs,and video clips generated by the band and its fans."
5,Industrial-Gothic Mystic Visions,"The only word to describe this work is visionary. Kurt's tremblingly-spoken narrative ties the whole thing together as we become passengers on a tour through the subconscious fears and hidden agonies of late 20th-century suburbia. This album will show you your soul from the inside, with all the dark nooks and crannies where your deepest fears and doubts hide. Question authority; question convention; question everything. But don't be afraid; this will be your spirit journey as much as it is Kurt's."
5,Very cute,"This is a very cute book that stars Bulbasaur. A boy and agirl want to use their money to buy something, but they each wantsomething different. The girl wants to buy a tulip, and the boy wants to buy a frog. Then, they find a Bulbasaur, which they think will solve all their problems. After all, Bulbasaur looks like a frog with a tulip on it's back. However, the boy tries to feed Bulbasaur flies, but Bulbasaur doesn't like flies. The girl tries to water the bulb on Bulbasaur's back, but the water's too cold(Not only that, Bulbasaur's bulb won't sprout until it evolves into Ivysaur, but the girl obviously didn't know that.). Finally, Bulbasaur has to go out into the forest and find a real frog and tulip to give to the boy and girl. This book teaches kids to use creativity to solve problems, which is why I'd recommend it to kids."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!,"This really was one of my own personal best investments, which is funny, because he teaches you how to invest for your retirement. The book is filled with witty comments and sage advice. Pond is excellent in all that he does, and I can't wait for his next book! I hear its one for our kids, you know, those college-bound ones. You did it Johnathon Pond!"
1,Boomer's Guide to Retirement,I purchased the CD version. The speaker is tiring as is the subject matter. Save your money. Buy something else.
2,Poor show,Does not make much sense and what answers could be given are not there. Do not advise purchasing unless it is like for sale for $5.
3,Movie,Bad made for Tv movie ... gave it to my Sufi loving brother and he loved it. So as a gift it turned out great.
2,Nice try,"Having read the book and knowing something of Sir Richard Francis Burton famous exploits, and this mix of effort just was not even fairly true. They could not have had so many lousy props.No Matter Where You Die, you do not wake up with your clothes on. Maybe Sandman Slim......"
4,Not as bad as expected.,"ASIN:B0039PGH9G Riverworld]] sO MANY MOVIES MADE FROM BOOKS ARE horrendous. This one wasn't that bad. It did add new major characters and change exixting ones, but after some disasters e.g. STARSHIP TROOPERS. An Example of aceptable movies ,THE TWILIGHT SERIES, or HUNGER GAMES, These had changes that were acceptable. IMHO"
1,"Interesting original books, awful movie","The original Riverworld book series was interesting, coherent, and logical. This movie is none of these. Save your money and your time."
1,Total Cheddar,"My husband is really into this series of books and wanted to see an adapted interpretation. We turned this off 1/4 of the way through because:1.) It wasn't adapted from the book at all (I did, however, read this in some of the reviews before purchasing)2.) It's a SyFy movie. If you've ever seen one, you know exactly what I mean.3.) The acting is horrid.In defense of the movie, I warned my husband about the perils of SyFy movies, but of course. he didn't listen."
3,Mole,"Its an ok movie, but I cant stand that mole on the samurai girl. Every face shot has that mole sticking out like a sore thumb. Its very distracting and makes me sick, and ruins the movie for me as well. But I give it 3 stars because it has a compelling story with great characters. I would give it 5 if it werent for that mole."
3,Pushing The River Envelope Too Far,"This feature is not half the complexity and depth of the book series, probably due to the limits of the media; The screenplay and the editorial choices are not convincing (The absence of the alien Monat, for instance). On the other hand, the CGI and other visual effects are impressive. All in all, viewers who haven't read the book series, or at least the first book, ""To Your Scattered Bodies Go"" will find the movie less enjoyable, while for Farmer fans it is yet another must see. I liked better the 2003 TV version (which was a definite prologue for a sci-fi series, regrettably not picked up by SyFy channel))."
2,Waste of Time!,"No wonder I had never heard of this show, it was such a waste. I watched both parts hoping that something would be resolved however at the end it was just as it started. These characters die and come back to life in this strange world over and over and over, it's so pointless."
1,Having read the books ...,"I am thoroughly annoyed with SyFy for this movie ... the authors didn't really read the books, they didn't base these on much, and I am stunned by how bad this was. Horses? Really? (for starters ...) I couldn't finish it when it aired."
3,Kinda interesting,Starts off slow and picks up near the end of the 1st half. But doesn't hold my interest enough to watch the 2nd half.
1,Horrible!,The only thing remotely related to the books is the name 'Riverworld'. I'm going to reread those wonderful books to get the bad taste of this movie out of my mouth.
4,Clean Teeth,"Both parts of this system work great. The water jet definitely removes stuff that the brush misses, and leaves your teeth feeling just left the dentist clean."
2,"Great concept, short life expectancy","I've now owned three of these units. I like the idea of combining the electric toothbrush and irrigator instruments in one, lower profile, presence on the bathroom counter. The toothbrush is terrific. I've enjoyed the irrigator's performance...while it works. The life expectancy of the irrigator (based on owning three) is about 2 years for a single adult using it. With each unit, the toothbrush performed flawlessly. At the 2 year mark, the irrigator would stop working. There isn't an easy way to get it fixed and, in the end, the projected cost is almost as much as replacing it. I'm considering moving to a stand alone irrigator by a competitor. My experience with Oral B is that they make terrific toothbrushes, but not irrigators."
1,joke,"The toothbrush is outstanding but the water-pic part is a wimpy joke compared to the real Water Pic brand. The pressure created by the ""Oxy-Jet"" pic is lame even at the highest setting. Don't waste your money on this!"
2,Don't buy...,I just want to say DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to test how weak the water pic is. There is no doubt that brush is excellent but the water pic is really really really weak. I set to level 5 and it is even weaker the level 1 of my old one.
1,have not been able to use yet-part missing,"Amazon.com does not appear to have a phone number (I could not find it) to call for customer support and their online form only allows for a complete return of the product instead of offering the ability to get the missing part. Shipping the entire unit back will cost more then the missing part is worth. After several hours on the phone with P&G, they offered to replace the entire unit and cover shipping both ways. Very kind of Oral-B (P&G). I love their personal live person contact availability."
3,"not sure what the better alternative is, but there's got to be one.","i wanted to like this thing--but every once-in-awhile, even a good company put's out a POS. toothbrush is okay, reminds me to brush in quadrants which i guess is helpful. the irrigator / water-pik whatever it is, was weak out of the gate and got worse over time. all in all ... this unit's not a good value by my estimation."
5,excellent product,I have been using this electric toothbrush for over 5 years. It's really reliable and good.
4,well worth it,"This professional station is absolutely wonderful. The speed control on the Toothbrush is easy, just hold the button until right. The water pressure could be a bit stronger for the irrigation but it does do well, the water reservoir is easy to fill. The whole unit looks great and dosn't take up that much room. Dental Hygiene has nevere been easier."
2,Was hoping for so much more!!!!,"Well, after finding this item sold out in a few stores- I thought, maybe this is the the one...everyone is buying them because they are so great!BUT the main reason we purchased this item was for the water pik - we had an old sonic toothbrush that was worn out so the 2 in this package seemed like a great fit.NOT!!! the water pik did not have near enough power even set a 5 the highest level. It is way too big and kept coming on when you hit the button on the right side by accident.Taking this one BACK! ($120.00) Today! STILL LOOKING!!!"
1,Died in 2 months,"I ordered this product because I loved the idea of having a toothbrush/waterjet combination. When it arrived, I immediately tried the waterjet while the toothbrush was charging. The water pressure is not nearly strong enough to get between your teeth, so I never used it again as it seemed a complete waste of time. When the toothbrush finally charged up, I loved it. It really made my teeth feel dentist-office clean, so I decided to keep the machine even with the lame waterjet. Well, I have now had the Oral B 8900 for about 2 and a half months, and the battery is completely dead. It won't re-charge no matter how long I leave it plugged in. Unfortunately, I threw the box away once I decided to keep it, so I guess I'm stuck with a lemon product. At least the toothbrush was good while it lasted!"
5,great oral hygiene,Much improved over older models. I wish now I had ordered sooner.Does a great job on teeth and gums.
5,"dentist office clean mouth, at home","convenient, compact cleaning machine with multi-speed choices for the brush or waterjet, different brush heads and a tongue cleaner create smooth teeth and a fresh mouth....the waterjet sends a swirling stream which reaches under the gumline or a jet to loosen the flossable particles.....no need to struggle with breaking floss or sore fingers, the actions of the brush and waterjet stimulate the gums...easy to use and a great price"
2,Good While It Lasts!,I liked the concept of a combined unit. Both do an acceptable job. Unfortunately the hose is not very good quality and once it tears to replace it you need to ship or take to a service center. Cost to repair is almost as much as a new unit. So you are left with a toothbrush only. Do not recommend.
5,Great buy!,Feels like I just stepped out of the dentist's chair! I had beginning stages of gum disease and after using it for a few weeks the bleeding stopped and no more problems.
2,OxyJet .....Thumbs down! Toothbrush...Thumbs up!,"I have been wanting to upgrade my old original Oral B electric toothbrush to the newer higher speed versions out now....Solicited via email by AMAZON/Oral B to spend $129 on Oral B Braun products and receive a $50 AMAZON gift credit during the month of August.( have yet to receive it 8/23 today)I bit...The Oral B ProfessionalCare 8900 DLX OxyJet Oral Care Centeris a combo unit that I had hoped would not only replace my old brush but also replace my old ""WATER PIK""NO WAY!! the brush is excellent! really an improvement over the original...but the ""OXY JET"" irrigator? is by no means a replacment for my old trusty Water Pik...which is far more powerful and gets in between my teeth and into the spots where only floss was thought to go!The OXY JET is down right wimpy! weak...no matter which head or speed setting I choose...It just does not have the blasting power I need!Franlkly I should fwd this to the company...it truly is poor!"
1,Oral B what has happened to quality control,"Last year I wrote: Love my new Oral B (Braun) toothbrush, looks like my old model with added bonuses. The old one lasted over 4.5 years. This one has all the same stuff I loved about the old one, but is quieter and now has adjustable speed control. Same wonderful round toothbrush that gets in all the corners so nicely!One year later: the on/off button is fussy and does not always work. The last set of Oral-B Precision Clean Brush heads I bought are junk, the brush heads got really sloppy and then fell off, two were less than two weeks old and the second two only lasted a month at the most! These are not inexpensive brushes. Impossible to control when the bristle head is flopping around like crazy, and then they fall apart!"
2,"The adhesive of this black tape is not as strong as the gray, and neither is as strong as normal duct tape should be.","I bought both the black and regular gray colors of this duct tape. Neither one has the adhesive strength I expect from expensive duct tape. I expect the adhesive of duct tape to stick to my hands and be extra strong. It doesn't with this tape at all. The gray tape has a little bit stronger adhesive than the black tape. The descriptions may hint at this as it says one has more fabric than the other. It's not that this tape won't stick, it's that it doesn't stick sufficiently to be ""duct"" tape. I won't be buying this ""duck"" tape brand of ""duct"" tape again."
5,White is awesome!,"Great if you have white woodwork for installing AC units to seal out the air and bugs...makes for a nice clean install. This stuff tears when you want it to and not when you don't. Sells at wally world for about the same price, but they don't always have it...why I love being a prime member."
4,Great color!,Sometimes you need a bright color for your duct tape; this did the trick. My husband really appreciated having this.
4,Good product; fast delivery,"Duct tape is overpriced but as far as that goes, this one was better than some. I think we should be able to get these cheaper."
4,As expected.,"good old duck tape. Can't go wrong. And for a DIY project that required red colored tape, this is what fit the bill."
1,music from pedro's films,These are remixed songs from the movie soundtracks. I enjoyed the collection from the movie soundtracks much more.
1,Save your money!,This product has not been updated for several years. It really does not work very well and not worth the money. I was very disappointed in it's performance. Scanning a from into Print Shop and creating text boxes is actually easier.
5,A MUST FOR SINGLE PARENTS,"THIS BOOK IS A GREAT TOOL FOR THE FATHER OR MOTHER, SUDDENLY THUST INTO A POSITION THEY WERE NOT PREPARED FOR. THIS PARTICULAR COPY IS IN PERFECT CONDITION."
5,An outstanding novel,This is a novel that brings the story of a twisted relation between a man and a woman in the atmosphere of the 19 century in Europe. It is a very piercing novel and it stayed with me although I have read it a long time ago. It is about an obsession of a weak man for a cruel dominating woman.It is written in a very special style and I think it is a masterpiece.
4,Very familiar scent,"I absolutely LOVE the original True Star! So I had to have a sample of the True Star Gold as soon as I found out about it! I've been wearing it for the past few days and I like this scent also. Just not as much as True Star. I was in love the scent of True Star Gold a few years ago...when it was called Tropical Punch by Escada. Yup, that's my verdict. It smells exactly like Escada's Tropical Punch. Really nice n' fresh n' VIBRANT. Like a fruitier version of True Star."
4,A Partial History of Science from a Classical Point of View,"Histories of how mankind views the world should be rather non controversial, but in this day of extremism those who favor Science and Naturalism are locked in a bitter fight with religious fundamentalists, over Darwinism and much else. As one who leans toward the scientific story I wondered why I was reading this book that was very much interested in how the ancients saw the world and why they came to the conclusions that they did. The book took me back to my undergraduate years when I had a much more liberal attitude toward life - and I enjoyed it for that. The facts are accurate, and the style is that of a very well educated author. It is a pleasent read whatever your philosophy of life."
5,A well-written guide to human exploration and cosmology,"David Park, a professor of physics, writes with expertise about humankind's quest to answer the big questions of life: How did we get here? Is there anyone else out there? Science can only take us so far before crossing the unseen boundary into metaphysics and speculation, but it's an interesting trip nonetheless."
5,it's worth it,"$999.98 may seem high for a how to book by a live avatar, but if you have the juice and can absorb Hall's magic, rainbow's end may be within your grasp. pending that you may bless the cost of ineffable alchemy."
5,Good dvd,"Very good dvd. Good to see Peter,Gabriel. Hope to see him on the road touring the US. . Good dvd"
3,underwhelmed,"Saw this in 3D as a special event at a theater. 3D was well done and flat DVD or Blu-ray will not have that. Secret World is one of my favorite DVDs so perhaps my expectations / hopes were unrealistically high. But this is Peter and an orchestra (New Blood), not an orchestra backed rock band. Peter practically speaks the lyrics to the early songs. Did not have the theatrics that Secret World had, OK but I was hoping for stellar."
2,"Well crafted, but supremely boring","I feel bad to give a bad review to a piece of high art. They obviously put a lot of effort into it, and the recording and video are both excellent.But, to me this was simply a self-indulgent, even nerdy, twist on pop music. If you are expecting the nice melodies of your favorite Gabriel songs, forget it. The songs that you know that are in the concert are so heavily rearranged you will hardly recognize them. And everything is down tempo. Boring, unless you are doing your masters in music theory perhaps."
5,Espetacular,(Portuguese) Eu tive a oportunidade de ver ao vivo em Paulínia (Brasil) no festival SWU esse verdadeiro espetáculo do gnio Peter Gabriel - indescritível a experincia!!!
2,New Peter Gabriel DVD a downer,"This is slow and sad, almost dirge like. It does not show the mischievous qualities of the Secret Garden performance of the 1990s. The female vocalist in Don't Give Up is not in the same league as Kate Bush or Paula Cole and it feels awkward and lacking in chemistry. Big disappointment"
2,Is Gabriel without a rhythm section just Muzak?,"I love Peter Gabriel's music, particularly when he wraps his sometimes rather pretentious lyrics around driving, complex African rhythms. Take away the drums and what's left? Pretentious lyrics with a bland background. Sort of like Chinese food without the MSG, there does not seem to be much point. Now, I really like classical music but Shock the Monkey is no concerto either, so it lacks the complexity of that genre, and unlike the late Freddy Mercury, Peter Gabriel cannot do opera. If you like bland music, this is the disk for you."
3,Good but Beware!,"Peter Gabriel's music with no drums, guitars, bass, this is what this Blu-Ray is. It's new arrangements of songs with orchestra and a couple of females vocalists. So those news versions are classical oriented and are definitively more relaxed than the original songs. There is also about four songs taken from others composers. Those songs didn't grab my attention as very interesting songs, as some late Gabriel's songs, like ""In Your Eyes"" and ""Don't Give Up"". My favorite songs are from my favorite cd, and it's ""The Rhythm Of The Heat"" and ""San Jacinto"".The music is more of a background sound to let the beautiful voice of Peter shines. The picture quality is excellent as the DTS-HD sound. I don't know if i can recommend this for all Peter Gabriel's fans. Maybe they will be disappointed with the quiet atmosphere and sound, missing the rock environement. For me, i didn't feel enough brilliant moments to enjoy the performance from start to finish."
4,"Love it, but missing a few of my favorite songs from the later part of the tour.","My only disappointment is the setlist. His covers of Listening Wind and Heroes are two of my favorites off the Scratch My Back CD. These two songs plus Secret World were some of my favorites from the show in Milwaukee (to top it off, I arrived just a few minutes late and missed the most of Heroes). I realize that they taped this at the start of the tour and these songs were added later in the tour. Still was hoping they might have included them as bonus tracks or something like that."
2,CharlieC,"I was somewhat disappointed...Somewhat old fashioned, I was much more impressed with Mr.Gabriel'salbum ""Secret World Live"" [2003].Both were good, but still preferred the former.TFS"
1,The Missing Warning Label,CAUTION: This product may cause drowsiness. Do not engage in activities requiring mental alertness or perform hazardous tasks while watching this video recording.
2,Yuck,"I just didn't like it. No big explanation. The 3D was so... unnoticeable. I didn't know most of his songs and he was so passive about his performance, nothing grabbed me. I want to step on the disc and fling it into the air."
1,Freaking BORING!!!,"Freaking BORING!!! What has happened to Peter Gabriel? I guess the good old days of ""So"" are over. Regret making this purchase. Who knows, maybe I'll enjoy it one day... When I'm INSANE!!!!"
2,lemonstm,"These items came quickly, but when I opened the boxes I found that one of the fountains was broken and could not be used for my event. The fountain wasn't that easy to use, I even ordered the sephra chocolate for it and still had problems."
3,outdoor wood furnishings,"This book is excellent in many ways, but there are some errors in measurement and some unclear directions and omissions."
4,Fast and funny,"This is a totally amusing and engrossing tale of ambition and despair in Hollywood's TV land. It is about intelligent, complex, and quick-witted people, and fortunately the author is enough of all these things to create convincing characters.I recommend it to all who appreciate intelligent writing."
5,the belz,"Its rare that i want to get on here and comment on a book but the bones is fantastic, funny, fun, sharp, irreverent, inside Hollywood's funny farm and although obviously i don't know for sure, frank bones is highly reminiscent of Richard Belzer and even though Larry David is listed in the acknowledgments, something tells me this was written with him or someone close to him in mind. excellent book couldn't stop reading it."
3,great for the price,"this cookware is great for the price, durable and easy to cook with. it is not the best available but remember, you get what you pay for.It is a fantastic starter set."
2,Extraordinarily mediocre,"Got this set after leaving my Analon with my roommate. Geez...One is already scratched (all I did was cook eggs in it--and only used plastic.) The ""non-stick"" is not accurate. I've used stainless that had better properties. These don't heat very quickly. My prediction: These will be tossed, given away, or gather dust as soon as my new set arrives. If you are used to using something nice, these are a real disappointment. But if this is a starter set or you need to collect rain water that comes thru your roof, these will work just fine."
3,"Terrible Film, Amazing Movie (3.5)","Yes, if you are looking for an amazing story or the iconic introspective thinking that in sues from watching good anime then you've come to the wrong place. But if you want to watch some of the best animated action sword fighting scenes nestled in a feudal Japan setting then booyah, you've got a winner."
2,Boring,If I was still 14 I probably would have liked it. Maybe since I'm 23 I'm getting too old for anime.
3,Cotton on to this,Watched this after watching Blood Stained Bride [from the same studio distributors] and this was definately more funny with superb tongue in cheek acting from the majority of the actors. Cheap and cheerful and a nice comic book style presentation from the classic horror comics era of old. Plenty of nice looking girls and a fair attempt at some gore.Two animal activists free a bunny rabbit [that moves on a string or slow motion effect!]recently injected with a serum that makes him aggressive. He bites a German farmer who then turns into a vicious mutant rabbit/human! All the men appear as dorks in this film so it left to the five girls to dress in bunny outfits to try and trap him/it. Well I found it funny!
3,Doesn't fit well,"The straps are a bit tight and the bodice a bit too low (as in too short, not as in too revealing.)"
3,"Great music, poor sound quality.","Love his music but am not impressed with the quality of the sound. It doesn't sound clear on my BOSE, doesn't do very well in my car or on my brand new laptop. Guess this is what you have to deal with buying an older record, however, I was hoping for this to be an exception given the price."
4,Slide came apart very easily.,This product is good for imaginary play. It is not very durable because the slide kept coming apart. I would not recommend this product to a friend.
5,Cool Toy,My son ADORES Higglytown and so my daughter came online with me and picked this out for him for Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised when I got it and we opened it Christmas morning! The quality is GREAT... it's TONS of fun! He slides all sorts of stuff down the slide! There are a few things I didn't like about it... the slide and the ladder come off fairly easily. So I am forever putting it together again! But he has played with this for hours on end!! He truly adores it and can't wait to get the rest of them(as he said he is SURE santa is bringing him the rest this next Christmas!)... but if your child loves Higglytown or you are looking for a cool toy... I highly recommend it!
4,Very nice!,"Looks great in my 2006 Hummer H3. The only gripe I have is that in 2006, Hummer only used one hook on the floor for securing mats in place. In later years, they used two on each side.These mats have two holes in them. I wish that WeatherTech would not punch the hole in the second position and/or have a one or two hole option. Now I have an open hole on an otherwise beautifully fitting mat.I would think that WeatherTech could just as easily put a small marking where the second hole ""should"" go along with instructions as to what size to cut it, or make it perforated in some way so that it could be popped out if needed.Other than that - great mats - awesome fitment."
1,Christmas in Harmony,Not the kind of book I'd be interested in reading again. Corny and with out substance.
5,Funny and Heartwarming!,"Philip Gulley won me over with his first Harmony book, ""Home to Harmony."" His character development and wonderful sense of humor bring the people in his books alive. I was quite surprised when I found that this book was only 84 pages long! But that is good for a Christmas book, as you can read it in one sitting. Anyone who has been a member of a church can find someone to indentify with or knows someone in their church like Dale Hinshaw! I laughed out loud more than once, but the best part of the book was the ending.......very heartwarming, touching and made a tear roll down my cheek."
4,Good book,"The whole Harmony series is very enjoyable, and it among my favorite in the fiction genre. They are all light-hearted and full of wonderful and entertaining characters. The books follow Sam, a pastor in a small-town Quaker church, and the eclectic group of individuals who are members.You will likely find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of Dale, as he undertakes his scripture-egg project or his salvation balloons. Fern Hampton may drive you nuts, but you'll learn to love her. I will say that this one is shorter than all the rest, and didn't leave me quite as fulfilled.Many reviewers compared this to the Mitford series, reading this one because they enjoyed the Mitford series so much. I tried reading the series after this one, and found it dry and dull.These books are easy, pleasant and clean reads. Enjoy!"
5,Christmas in Harmony,"If you haven't been to Harmony, this is your chance to have Christmas there! What a great story..wonderful for holiday time..it brings all the magic and wonder of the season to life! I bought it in large print..I recommend this book and all by its' author!"
5,Funny but believable,"I highly recommend any of Philip Gulley's books, and this is almost hilarious. If a reader is looking for something almost true to life and funny he/she can't go wrong with Mr. Gulley's Harmony series books"
3,Gully is tops when it comes to humor.,"Typical of all of Philip Gulley's books, it is chock full of humor. Most enjoyable is that from one book to the next, we recognize and learn a little more about about each of his book characters. Truly light hearted, entertaining reading.I was disappointed in the size of the book, only 84 pages, almost child-like in size compared to each his other books. It can easily be consumed in one sitting. Was this one rushed to print because of the Holiday Season? Having read all of Gulley's other books, this one doesn't quite measure up."
3,Christmas in Harmony,"I lost interest after the first two chapters. It was more about a person talking about his life, rather than being in his life."
4,Gulley is always entertaining,Another adventure from Harmony. Gulley provides both humor and honesty in how church life can be both. Always a pleasure to read.
2,Sold out,"Lil rob tries way to hard on this album to have that mainstream radio sound but it doesn't work for him, he is way better rapping to the slower old rap beats. Honestly i didn't hear one good line in this whole album. So maybe he is trying to reach a different audience with the newer style but at the same time he has lost or losing alot of his old school fans. He just needs to keep it the way hes always done it."
4,AIIGHT,this cd is tight but it isnt banging like all of his other cds the production is different it sonds more like neighboorhood music then high til i die i like his old style much more but im still gonna get his stuff if he uses this style toL.P.W.W.
2,Lil.Rob Gone Soft,"Damn Lil.Rob Is So Different Now I Remember He Use To Rap About Gangster Life Now He Has Gone Soft. With The Song Name ""Back In The Streets"" What The Heck Kinda Song Was That, Did Kanye West Help You On It. The Only Good Song's Are ""Superbad"" And ""Bring Out The Freak In You"" Even Tho They Arent The Same Stuff He Use To Rap About. Save Your Money!!"
4,kid frost's resurrection!,"this album aint bad its just some music to chill to and summer nights is a good song and one of the best on here. i dont know where hes from but hes a good rapper. some music is club music or relaxed music. it aint nothing hardcore. maybe the lyrics are a lil raunchy in the song ""let me bring out the freak in you"", its still a good album. just some music to listen to on my ipod when im checkin out girls lol. i never even heard of lil rob until this year (2005) when i seen the music video for summer nights. i was like: ok he got something he kinda like kid frost with a touch of soul. the soul samples are nice kinda like dipset when they do theres but not all hype just relaxed. this album is alright ya'll should pick it up. its sounds good."
1,gooofy as rapper,"this dude is a chump how do lame asses such as this guy get a deal i would rather burn my ears off than listen to this ""gangsta"" rap or sing or whatever he does. whoever buys this is a sraight up lame."
2,Lil Rob is weak,CHICANO RAP IS SORRY...man these vatos need to stop acting like punk ass cholos and just rap about the neighborhood and growing up Chicano without all the cholo style that gets no play with the real ladies unless youre in wack ass texas. This album was a little better than some other chicano rap but overall it still sucks.At least he aint Paki like Capone E....Puro Compton.
3,not the same,me and my friends have most of lil robs cds and all of them are great there is not one cd that i dont listen too but this one he really changed his beats arent as good and his topics are bad. I only liked about maybe 3 songs summer nights is good and 2 or 3 other ones but i say you get any other lil rob cd except this one.
4,BROWN PRIDE !!!,"Few cd's now provide as many bangin joints like this cd. From top to bottom this cd delivers a great collection of hardcore hip hop with some 'radio friendly' hits and some old school sounds that your 'papi' would enjoy.This cd is very well produced, and Lil' Rob is very talented. 'Summer Nights' is the best, but the rest of the cd is not far behind. Being from Connecticut, I don't know much from this artist. But trust me, I will buy more of his music.I hope you do the same."
1,"The content is great, the sound quality is lousy.",The content of this DVD video is great. There are actual interivews with survivors from the Titanic as well as summaries of newspaper articles that reported the disaster shortly after it happened. There is even a summary of those that testified at the trial that detail the last hours of the tragic sea voyage.All this is undermined though by the fact that the sound quality of this DVD is in most part non existent. This impairs greatly our ability to listen to what could be a top notch oral adventure of what really happened to the ship that night and the world's reaction to it.I was not able to watch the entire DVD because the sound quality was so bad.
2,BOR-rrring!,"First off, let me say that I am a huge documentary fan and this production is without doubt the worst one I've ever seen! Quality is akin to the mash-up a high school radio and TV student might throw together and sound quality is TERRIBLE! I concur with the remarks of a previous reviewer: it IS tedious. It's almost as if all the exciting bits went into another documentary and this was just the crap left over...Rent it from your local library but don't waste your money purchasing it would be my advice."
4,Good book for first-time Maine visitors,"The Coast of Maine book is good if you're a first-time visitor to the state. I recently bought this before going to Maine for a week and found this book very helpful. If you're going to be driving a fair amount, then you'll like this...it provides information about the interesting things to do in the major coastal towns and areas in between. This book is lacking in a couple of areas, however. First, the hotel and restaurants listed are few in number and don't provide the best selection, although it is a start. Second, the maps aren't very helpful if you're going to do a lot of driving and provide only a relative idea of your location. I would recommend getting a AAA map of Maine to accompany this book.That said, this is still a very useful book. Most of the other books on Maine were too focused (e.g., only lodging, or only lighthouses, etc.). This one at least gives a good overview and identifies both the common and less well-known things to do."
3,not for everyone,"if you remember ""the tick"" cartoon from years ago, then you might appreciate some elements of this game. the humor of the cartoon is translated well into the game, however as a stand alone game it falls short. the levels are easy and redundant. the controls are simple but work well. for the most part ""the tick"" is a side scrolling brawler, offset by side scrolling avoidance levels. if you are a huge fan of ""the tick"", you will appreciate what this game has to offer. if you aren't, then i don't think you would enjoy anything about this game."
1,BAD GAME!,i hate this game its bad i meen your playing as a supid tick and you have to go into peoples homes and suck thir blood but the problum is that whenever you go up to someone the person swats you and thirs another problum when someone swats you you die and thirs another problum thirs only 2 levels i beat the game in 3 days and thirs another problum NO SAVE so when you turn the game off you have to start at level 1 plus the tick flys funny and thirs no real blood anyway i hate this game super mario world is better i got out my chinsaw and shredid it the next day
5,satisfaction,The product was familiar to me and I was very pleased to get such a quality product for a reasonable price. It was shipped and arrived here in good time. Thanks!
1,Company was less than forthcoming,"Was not what I ordered. I wanted the one that matched my old chicken-sized cooker but received a clay baker that might fit a cornish game hen or two. If the range was 2-5 pounds, then I certainly got the 2 pound one. But it works well enough for pork, so I've kept it. I will not order from this company again, however. I detest duplicity."
4,Rotation Diet review,"well written book. Easy to follow, concise, offers good recipes. I am currently following the update to this book that includes low fat eating. The advantage of this diet is that ""you can do anything for 21 days"" and good tips to maintain in between concentrated weight loss."
2,SURPRISED,"FELT LIKE I WAS OVER CHARGED FOR THE BOOK AND THE SHIPPING. IF I KNEW I WAS PAYING ALMOST $12.00 FOR A USED BOOK, I WOULD HAVE SHOPPED AROUND."
5,The best diet ever,I recommend this diet for everyone. This is the most balanced and complete diet. You learn to eat and to enjoy healthy food while you loose pounds.
3,The Rotation Diet,"There is nothing wrong with the book, but I cannot follow a 600 calorie diet for even three days. I will try to modify the diet, but this will take awhile."
1,The Rotation Diet,I thought the diet too strict and not healthy in how it kept increasing and decreasing the amount of foods you ate. It didn't keep a constant calorie count. In some causes it was like I was eating nothing (which was in fact the case) and then others it barely reached a 'normal' amount of a healthy calorie level.It was very hard to follow and by the end of a week I had stopped even wanting to try because of how unappealing the foods were.
4,"Good and effective, but.....","This is a diet that really works, but you must follow the plan to the letter. The back portion showing the calories in various foods has no standard portion measurements, making it imposible to compare apples to oranges (If you'll pardon the play on word)The diet requires tremendous willpower because you will be very hungry on this extremely low calorie diet. It is important that you read the entire book so that you understand the priciples that make this diet work. If you aren't willing to make a permanent( although not terribly difficult) lifestyle change, don't try this diet. If you are serious about loosing weight and keeping it off, this really works. Because of the exercise and very low caloric intake, you might want to consult with a doctor before undertaking this diet."
5,The BEST DIET EVER !,"This is the one and only diet that has worked for me. I used it years ago to take off 25 pounds which I kept off for 8 years until I got pregnant. I am now using it again to lose post-baby weight. The unique feature of this diet is that it is only 3 weeks long, there is a definite end. Then, you take a break and do it all over again if you want. It's fantastic! Buy it, you won't be sorry."
1,"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Emo! No, really! We are!","Nothing new here, folks. Same old/new formula. These boys should decide on a direction and follow it, just please don't turn into another 3-piece ""Blink-N-Green"" clone. God knows we need more of ""those"", eh?"
5,"Really, really good","I discovered DLD by watching the video for Hammers and Heart on LAUNCH. Fell in love with that, went out and bought this - and I love just about every song. This is an incredible band. My personal favorite tracks are Pollen and Salt, Sundays, and A Year in an Airplane."
3,Good summary,"Schlesinger gives us a good overview of the impetus for and process of creating the UN. There are some interesting, provocative events told in this story, but I finished the book thinking the story could (should) have been more interesting. That said, it was a decent, consistent read--a good case study in ""getting to 'yes'""."
3,Praise for a corrupt and greedy world-conqueror,"What is missing from American readers is an ability to read between the lines, and a state of denial of where this world is heading. Why do Democrats try to portray the need for the UN? They condition us to think the sky will fall without their ""international"" support. Did you know that America abandoned China, refusing even to sell them weapons, all the while, they were being taken over by the communists who control china today, and were members of the U.N. while the nationalists China were removed from membership. I think the best thing this country could do is leave the U.N.Read the book ""The Insiders: Architects of the New World Order"" for a real education. Or ""None Dare Call it Conspiracy.""if can't find here, try ebay."
1,Don't buy this product!,"Much to my disappointment, this is same crappy product I thought it was, but I was compelled to try it anyway in my desperate attempt to find something to hold down my continuous glucose monitor. You might as well get some wax paper and scotch tape for as well as this sticks to your skin.This100 count box should last 2 weeks (If I'm lucky!) Also it's exceedingly expensive."
5,Great.,My husband requires these for his insulin pump. They work really well in keeping everything attached. Even in the summer with presperation.
5,i always use these,Type 1 diabetic and I use these to cover up my CGM site. They are very thin and it doesnt really feel like you have anything there.
3,Just O.K.,"I heard a lot about this line of eye pencils...but I have no love for these. I'm a makeup artist (side gig) and most of the time, I need my eye pencils to perform; apply smoothly, be smudgeproof, be long wearing. These pencils (I've purchased several from different suppliers, both in-store, and online) always seem on the dry side and don't deliver much impact. I prefer MAC Power Point pencils, which are also waterproof. They give you about 30 seconds of ""play"" time to smudge, if you wish, then they stay put! I really regret buying all of these Sorme pencils, but at least they were cheap/inexpensive! I'll be giving them away."

5,Bought a refurb - AWESOME!,"This TV is awesome! It makes a great centerpiece to my home theater. I didn't need a built in HD tuner because I use satellite, so this TV was perfect. I was between this and the Toshiba 62HM84, I am totally happy with this. I bought it refurbished on Amazon for about $600 less than i could have bought it new. It was my first ever refurb purchase and it has been flawless so far."
3,Samsung HLP6163 - blurry!,"I bought one of these for Christmas and though the picture was a lot better than the old TV I had, I always got an eyeache from watching it, as thought it wasn't in focus. Others in my household didn't notice it so when I wanted to return it, I got a lot of complaints! I traded it for the Samsung HLP5674 with the one-mirror-per-pixel HD2+ chip and really like the picture better. Others in the household and friends then all commented on how much better it looked. My eyeaches are gone. We watch mostly DVDs and HDTV, where the difference is amazing, though I think for SDTV you may not notice the difference in the models and won't have to give up the slightly larger 61"" screen."
2,Color problem,"I just bought this HDTV set this week and very desappointed with its picture and color quality. I am still waiting for a new HD converter box from Cox Communications, so I cannot say much about the HDTV programs. But for a normal TV channel, the picture and color quality are much worse than my old regular TV set. The picture is very blurry, and color is at best unnatural. All adjustments on the color settings are in vain. With this size of screen, your eyes will be under tortures when the pictures are not good. I can hardy watch an entire movie.I had hope that these problems are related to the fact I do not have yet the HD box. But when reading other postings, I know now I am not alone. Not sure how to resolve this, but for potential buyers, be aware. I've done a lot of researches, but don't expect this type of problem for a set at this price. Make sure you watch an ordinary non-HD program while shop around, don't just rely on what the stores show you in demo."
1,$20 for this???,"The Jam Jacket is just a rubber jacket that is supposed to mold around your Ipod. Don't waste your money, unfortunatly I already did. I mainly needed a cover for the Ipod that will cover the screen to eleminate scratches; the Jam Jacket does no such thing, it barely fits. Everytime that I even touch my Ipod, I have to resituate the jacket to line up with the screen and buttons. The Jam Jacket gets 1 star from me because of it's crappy material, lousy fit, ugly color, zero screen protection, and being a more of a pain in the ass than useful!"
4,Worth the price,Great sound card upgrade for an older system or a great replacement for the stock audio in most PC's.
5,Good sound card at a good price,"This is a good upgrade for someone using the onboard sound on their pc. I installed one of these for a user who was having difficulties with stuttering sound as she watched DVD's, (she is in our marketing dept., and does quality assurance).The sound delivered via this card, watching DVDs, was excellent.This is the card that I would buy for myself, (and might have to for my Vista upgrade).Bottom Line: Much better sound than your onboard audio delivers, good price, and easy to install. NOTE: The software install takes a while and doesn't tell you what's going on. Avoid the urge to think it's done, and reboot. Other than that, a great product and I've installed these on Windows 2000 and XP systems without trouble. Vista, don't know."
2,cant tell the difference,i cant tell the difference after i installed this and disabled my mobo audio which was PC97 audio.maybe it works well i dont know but its ok
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SOUND CARD!!!,"This is not a 5.1 sound card. I repeat. THIS IS NOT A 5.1 SOUND CARD. I have years of experience with computers and with sound systems. I don't know why you would buy this card if it doesn't play 5.1 sound and the resulting sound is no better than the on-board sound. A waste of money. If you are still unconvinced of whether to buy this, then if you do, and in a year's time you need tech support or any type of question for that matter, they will not answer your email. No phone calls, no email, no nothing. They literally sent me an email saying after one year of purchase they will only offer support if I BOUGHT it! Wow! Instead of purchasing support for this card I bought a SIIG 7.1 sound card and love it. See my review."
3,"Good Product, Bad Support","While this card delivers great sound and features, woe be to he or she that experience a problem. Tech support is limited to a bank of seemingly recently graduated DeVry students who seem to be able to do little more than quote help files, and really aren't familiar with the hardware they're supporting. Hard as I tried to get a direct answer to my problem, all they could do is throw more help file links at me. When I asked to be directed to Level 2 support (a commonality in the industry) I was told that there was only one level."
3,Sound Blasetr Audigy SE,"This Audigy was to replace a Creative Soundblaster Live Digital Sound Card that Creative no longer supported. Not being able to upgrade the drivers I desided to go for a Audigy SE. BIG MISTAKE as , you cannot down load the new up dated drivers as the program will not accept the new drivers. Even Creative support was no help. In my opinion , creative who used to be the best has really fallen . I, personally do not recommend any Creative products. I have since purchased a good quality sound card that is NOT Creative"
3,Great Sound Quality but 300mb Memory!,"Good- Quality of sound, one you play around with it.Bad- Uses up ton of memory. 300mb Made my computer sluggish until I removed manny of the features then was fine"
1,Garbage,"Before you buy anything from Creative, google the words incompatible + legacy drivers + sounblaster + windows xpHuge compatibiltiy issues that will have Creative Tech help telling you to flash and update your system bios, chipsets, leaving an entire PCI slot between Sounblaster card and any other card, update drivers, yada, yada, etc. Read all of the issues from the aforementioned google, and ignore the Creative employee reviews (they are easy to spot). Creative ignores the fact that its products have huge conflicts with Windows operating systems."
5,This is an excellent sound card,"This sound card is excellent. The drivers installed easily on Windows XP, and work flawlessly. The sound card has excellent sound. Even the most serious gamer or music player would find this card excellent for their needs.What makes this even more surprising is the price is only around $27.There is no need to spend $100 or 200$ on a sound card. For $27, you get an outstanding performer."
2,"Great for desktops, poor for media centers","There are pros and cons to this audio card alas.PRO: easy to install, and plays well with PC speakers, up to PC surround sound speakers. Drivers took minutes to install, and the converted volume control allows you to set each speaker.CON: Does not support true Dolby 5.1/6.1/7.1, thereby making it incompatible with HD DVD and Blu-ray. Optical sound to an audio receiver stands at Stereo PCM, not 5.1. The add-on needed for optical/coaxial sound is seldom available even on Creative's store. Lastly, tech support is severely lacking.If you wish surround sound on a desktop PC, this card might suit you. However, if you need Dolby in any way, avoid this card like the plague. For Blu-Ray and Media PCs, get this card:Diamond XtremeSound 7.1/24 bit Sound Card with Dolby Digital Live ( XS71DDL )"
3,Windows 2000 driver may not be on install CD and has less features,"Haven't tested on Vista, but OS compatibility might also depend on the manufacture date of product.I recently got one of these and the box mentions compatibility with Windows 2000 (SP4), XP, and Vista. But when I popped in the CD on a Windows 2000 SP4 machine, the software stops, stating that it found an incompatible OS. Turns out Creative shipped only the new drivers on CD, which are incompatible with Windows 2000.To get the Windows 2000 drivers, you need to download the older driver for the card from Creative's website (~50MB). Sadly the older driver has less features, one that I especially like that was missing was ""What U Hear"" audio mixing capability of the sound card."
3,gets the job done.,"Works fine. Mainly got this to work with vista when vista first came out and my on-board sound wasn't compatible with vista. Now I'm on win7 and it still works fine. I use a 2.1 setup. Not amazing, like some higher-end cards but gets the job done."
5,Subosi,"I bought this card to replace an external box that quit working after several years of use. I have six speakers and a sub-woofer connected to my computer, so the standard sound card thats installed on the motherboard only allows for one connection. This Sound Blaster Audigy Se card intalls inside my computer so I don't have to tie up a usb slot like I did for the external box. The Sound Blaster card is a whole lot cheaper than the external usb box that it replaced. I am totally satisfied with this card, as it allows me to have true surround sound, and also comes with a program that has a graphic equalizer and allows you to add all different kinds of special sound effects. It is worth every penny and out performs cards that are much more expensive. I am 100% satisfied with its performance and highly recommend it."
1,"Decent output to the speakers, poor output to headphones","I was really looking forward to this card, but I should've checked the ""Sound Blaster Audigy"" page on Wikipedia.""The Audigy SE is a stripped down version of the Audigy, with software-based EAX 3.0 (upgraded to software-based EAX 4.0 with a driver update), no advanced resolution DVD-Audio Playback...It lacks the EMU10k1/10k2 processor, instead using a CA-0106 Family chip. As opposed to the rest of the Audigy series, the SE is a low-profile PCI card.""The output to the speakers is better than my onboard sound, but I tried using my headphones and it's distinctly unimpressive."
2,Does the job,"I wasn't looking for anything special in a sound card. I just needed something to solve the sound problems I was getting in many games. I found out that it can be caused by using the motherboard's on-board audio. So I replaced it with this and it solved the problem.The audio isn't nearly as good though, and I just wanted a quick fix. I recommend saving up your money to buy an Omega Striker or Auzentech Prelude sound card instead."
4,Sound Blaster Audigy SE Card,I purchased this sound card to get a better sound from my old sound card that came with the computer that I got and I love it!!!
1,Garbage,"This, for me, was a clear example of getting what one pays for-- even less than what I paid for. The card worked for 2 weeks and then there was no sound. I tried every conceivable way to get the card to work, including new drivers, turning off integrated sound on the motherboard, and working with Dell technical support. What finally got back the sound was removing this sound card from my computer. Junk!"
5,My Review of the Best Female Singer Around...Gitane Demone,"This CD is the BEST I have heard from Gitane, don't get me wrong, her other CD Demonix was good, but this is very, very good. I don't know how to put it, but ""Somewhere"" is sort of a Jazz/Blues Gothic sound, Gitane's vocals, range everywhere, showing her true emotion for the song. As does for ""Lullaby For a Troubled Man"" which the only instrument...the piano is used, is wonderful at it's all best. ""Heavenly Melancholy"" is sort of a up beat dance style tune. And it's very easy to dance to. Her cover of Cole Porter's ""Love For Sale"" is the best song for me off the Album. I love it!! Keep it up Gitane!! :)"
4,Sweet Nothings for the Demonic Ear.,This a is a beautiful piece of work. The artist touches many areas of music (Darkwave Ambiant and Gothic). A must for any CHRISTAIN DEATH fan.
4,Excellent iPod doohickey...,"I bought this for my 15GB iPod and it fit like a glove, the clear plastic covers the screen and protects it nicely (no scratches so far). 99.9% of the iPod is protected and the sides are a nice grippy rubber. The arm band that comes with works like a champ and I use it to run with my ipod. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because one of the velcro straps that secure it over the top of the iPod covers the ""Hold"" switch.It does have a square hole in the bottom so I havent had to remove it from the jacket yet which is nice. It's not leather but it looks nice so spend the extra cash, you wont be sorry."
1,Night Watch,What I had exspected was another wonder of Pratchett's work!! What I got was a PLAY adapted for the stage. USE CAUTION when ordering!!!
3,Cute books but daughter ripped off flaps,"These books are really cute, but aren't really useful anymore. My daughter has ripped off just about all of the flaps. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,not impressed,"Because the flaps are cardstock (instead of cardboard), they can rip easily and are not easily lifted off the page by pudgy little hands. The illustrations are simplistic and unattractive. My son loves lift-the-flap books, but he doesn't love these."
3,"Nice, but too easily torn","My twins loved the birthday book, so I bought this set. Unfortunately as toddlers will do, most of the flaps have been torn off and I've grown tired of repairing the flaps. They like the flap books and some are a bit sturdier than these. It is a fun concept if you can constantly supervise the books while being used. I would not buy anymore simply because all of these have been torn apart in like a month."
3,Baby's Box of Fun,"My son's favorite book in the set is Where Is Babies Mommy. All of them have taught him words and he loves opening the flaps. However, when I first received the book it was completely destroyed. Took a long time to sort out with Amazon. Strongly suggest the book but don't suggest the service."
2,Great books too cheaply made,"My 16-month-old loves playing along with the story by lifting the flaps--but unlike with ""Dear Zoo"" (a highly recommended lift-the-flap book), in this set the flaps are simply glued on by a thin strip of the flap. Roughly once per read, he tugs too hard and pulls a flap out of the book. I certainly would have paid more for this set if it were properly made."
5,Great set of first books.,"My mother gave these books to my oldest son when he was born (five years ago). They were a favorite for several years, so much so that we wore them out with reading - even though they are made of sturdy cardboard. A must have for any children's library."
4,Baby's Box of Fun really is,"My 18 month old granddaughter LOVES these books. We read them over and over. She also enjoys putting them in and pulling them out of the box. Durable and sturdy enough for little hands. Bright colors, good buy."
5,Great gift set!,This is a great gift set of Karen Katz's childrens' books. My son loves lifting the flaps and discovering what's hiding underneath.
4,karen katz books,"My son who is 9 months old, loves when we read these books. I wouldnt recommend letting your baby have a go at it alone. The flap pages are flimsy and he ate threw some of them and bent them out of shape. Other than that, theyre great books and ive heard really good reviews."
3,Slightly Lacking,"Alan Silvestri gives a wonderful impression in Cast Away, but I did feel slightly cheated with the track that they chose to put in this compilation. The first three minutes are wonderful, nearly bringing me to tears, but the last four minutes sound like a meditation CD. I thought that this particular CD would the entire score of Cast Away, but as it turns out, Silvestri only used one cut and played it contiuously throughout the movie. The rest of the disc is wonderful, with bold music from Back to the Future, sweet innocence in Forrest Gump, and sad revelation from Cast Away. I found it enjoyable overall, but will be on the lookout for the complete soundtrack of Cast Away"
1,"Just the music, please.","If you are as moved as I was by the music Mr. Silvestri wrote for Cast Away, you may have to purchase this CD (as I had to). But be prepared to put up with a lot of other music from Silvestri's past and only a minimal amount of music from the film. Even then, the music has been interspersed with sound elements from the film (as if the music needed a crutch to stand)! 1 star for the album, 5 for the music."
4,The music of Alan Silvestri,"This CD combines the music of Alan Silvestri, on his work on Several of Bob Zemeckis' films. Along with the new CastAway music. It is wonderful, fom the grand Back to the future theme, to the fun music form 'Who framed Roger rabbit'. There is also Wonderful and touching Forrest Gump Suite, and my favorite, the end credits from Contact, A piece that can grab your emotions and put you back in the atmosphere of a wonderful movie. The new CastAway music is no disappointment, it continues with Alan Silvestri's great line of touching work."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. Soundtracks you don't want, and nothing much from Cast Away."
2,Review of audio CD Cast Away,"The audio CD, Cast Away from the film of Robert Zemeckis shows the image of Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away leading me to expect the CD was all from the Cast Away movie. There is only one song from the Cast Away movie. I am very disappointed in the purchase."
3,not what I thought that I ordered ... but became very happy,"I wanted just the music for Cast Away, and was not happy at first with my purchase. I listened to the CD and became very happy with the music."
1,Cast Away is a Rip Off,Buyer Beware !! If you think you are buying the soundtrack for the lovely music in the movie you are wrong. Cast Away is relegated to a 7 minute sequence of mostly waves crashing at the end of the disc. This is a misrepresented CD that masquerades as a movie soundtrack but is really a compilation
4,A nice collection,"This is a good collection to introduce new listeners to Silvestri, inspite of its brevity (for example: some music from ""Father of the Bride"" would have worked well in this collection). If you are Looking for ""Action Silvestri"" (i.e., ""Captain America"" or ""Predator"") look elsewhere- this is a collection of ""Melodic Silvestri"". It's not entirely sleepy, since selections from ""Back to the Future"" and ""Roger Rabbit"" are there to keep things bouncing along- it's just his more melodic side. Like I said- a great introduction to his work, and I'd recommend picking up a copy of ""The Abyss"" (Choral and melodic masterpiece) and ""Captain America"" (Big Superhero fun) with this CD- those scores would make nice bookends to this one, and your Silvestri experience will be off to a great start! My only real gripe with this album is that the ""wave"" sounds at the end of the ""Castaway"" track make me want to kick my stereo... but just a little."
4,Searching for Marilee Sprenger,"I highly recommend Ms. Sprenger's book. I want to invite her to speak at an education conference but am having difficultly locating her. If any one has information about how I can reach her, I would appreciate it. Even a clue, like what state or city does she reside in, would be very helpful. Of course an e-amil address is preferable."
3,"Nice bag, but doesn't hold it's shape","I bought this hoping it would protect a telescope, but returned it because I needed the bag to have more ""structure"" to hold it's shape even when empty. Otherwise, a very nice bag for the money."
5,An excellent book!,This book is a must for anyone interested in dangerous creatures. It covers nearly everything from the big cats to maruading army ants and includes accounts of real life encounters. I highly recommend it.
3,For nostalgia only,"I wanted to like this, but my memory of it being a poor competitor to The Real Ghostbusters still stands. The stories are weak, the animation is similar to the animated Beatlejuice show (a good thing), and the sound quality seems substandard for the time it was made. The series also resorted to a stall tactic similar to the old Hong Kong Phooey where you get to see the same minute long transition on every episode. Get this if you want to show your 1980s nostalgia cred, but not for good tv."
4,Great Cartoon.,"I loVe this cartoon, it is based on the live action TV show. But it does not get 5 from me becasue of 1. to much repeat animation. 2. The title song is H0RRIBLE. THE WORST."
5,old and still kicking,"fun to watch it again after all these years., been looking everywhere for this cartoon series and now i have the whole thing complete"
2,Ghostbusters,"Not Filmation's best, but I still recommend buying them.This is a sequel to the 1975 live action Ghostbusters show.The sons of the live action characters travel in time in every episode (great for time travel addicts like myself), and continue in the ghost busting tradition of their parents.The two volumes will give you all 65 episodes.Animation quality is compatible with Filmation's He-Man & She-ra shows, being made around the same time.Try the live action version too.All three are recommended for serious Filmation collectors.I'm hoping they'll do Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle next (probably Filmation's best long running show)."
5,The Best Of Filmation's Ghost Busters !!!,"Why hasn't Ink & Paint made a top 10 / best of filmation's ghost busters dvd collection 2 disc set yet? It could even include the 5 best episodes of the live ghost busters tv show from 1975 & the 5 best episodes of the cartoon series from 1986, which I hope would include the first 5 episodes of the cartoon itself played as a actual movie because it was a 5 part episode you know. It should even have carecter bios on all the main carecters from both shows & explain why Airhead, Floatsart & Fibface only apeared in 5 to 10 episodes & never again."
1,Go bust yourself,"This is awful. It's nothing like The REAL Ghostbusters. The theme song is just as catchy as the Inspector Gadget theme song becuase they only sing one line: ""Let's go Ghostbusters Let's go! over & over again. The ghosts,monsters,aliens & the main villian look like they came from a bad 1950's/1960's horror/sci-fi flick. The Belfly bat is nothing then Scrappy-Doo in bat-form. The Main cast have little to no personality. The jokes are cheesey & phoned in a mile away. The animation is ok. The stories are goofy even for a show like this. The Gorilla is nothing more then a second-rate Scooby-Doo wannabe. This show gives me a headache just even listining to it. My advice: Get The REAL Ghostbusters dvds by DIC. I give this set a 1 out of 10."
2,Disturbing,"This story was a very disturbing story. It is a picture of a dumb, unsucsesful in life, little mouse, and I believe it puts stupid ideas into the minds of little children. I think that a much more educational book is Come Out, Squirtle, because it teaches a very important lesson: better be safe than sorry, but it is nice to take a chance once in awhile."
1,Basic,"This is a very basic baby book that takes Pikachu throughout his day. Diaglog is ""Pikachu goes out Pika-side. Pikachu Pika-runs..."" It could be fun for preschoolers with older siblings who are interested in Pokemon."
3,STRICTLY for tiny tots!!,"Although this book stars the most popular Pokemon of all, Pikachu, don't expect that any kids old enough to follow the Pokemon series will enjoy this board book. It is a baby book in the strictest sense of the term! Could, however, be a great book for a tiny sibling of a older Pokemon fan."
1,Garbage,"Diz dude is trash... Listin to krs one , common, redman , lord finesse ,rakim to name a few... papoose is trash."
4,Top Quality Hip Hop,"First let me say that the reviews by ""tim"", ""otg"", and ""fatha"" are moronic at best. I've had this album for, I believe over 3 years now and it still gets regular rotation. Mind you i have over 500 cd's to choose from in my collection. This is grass roots hiphop... beats (bangers and jazzy mellow joints), lyrics are crazy..see the other review on here with the quoted verse... and just look at the friggin album cover...Ed O G is no chicken head/laffy taffy rapper. Maybe from a producers standpoint approximately 3 of the beats are monotonous.. but still remind u of the golden age of hip hop...simple loops and raw introspective, street thug and street philosopher rolled into one album. ED O G is one of the only hip hop prophets left!!!"
4,Canhead.com says buy this CD,"Boston's super mc Ed O. G returns with ""Truth Hurts"" and gives us some of that flavor hip-hop has been missing. Ed O.G. is back, doing it with this one. Check out ""Saying Something"" & ""What U Know""."
3,Rugged With a Cause,"Botson MC Edo.G always approaches the mic with a purpose. With delivery smooth, hooks simple and straightforward, the G infiltrates our mental with warnings and reflections, sometimes suggestions on everything from gettin' cash, love and relationships, childeren, and what it takes to remain true to the art form Edo obviously loves, Hip-Hop. With production by DJ Spinna, Pete Rock, Nottz, and the track one banger by DJ Premier, The Truth Hurts comes off both hard and melodic, sometimes mellow, but never weak. The production and lyrics do seem run-of-the-mill at times, even half-baked to say the least, but give props to Edo.G for using no B.S. skits as fillers, making for a complete album in the Boston format. As a whole this album reminds me of O.C.'s classic yet underrated LP, Word...Life. Another spot to hear Edo.G in prime lyrical action is the Beats and Lyrics compilation on a track titled ""I Feel You"", produced by DJ EQ. Enjoy. Peace."
2,This Truth Hurts,"Sometimes people had better retire than go on. Ed O.G. seems to fall into this category. The Boston hip-hop legend tries to come on again with pitiful beats and commonplace lyrics every other haphazard MC can spit. The whole thing combines to be an extraordinarily boring fifty odd minutes of super-mediocre hip-hop that doesnt in any way merit to be on one of the NuGruv labels.The only thing that saves it is Ed O.G.'s name. That is to say, only buy this album if you have the intention to complete your discography of Ed O.G. by adding this pitfall to your collection. Otherwise I recommend you download the one or two tracks that are worth listening to (!) ..."
1,And Only One Star!,"...make no mistake...this disc is worthless. Awfull bubble gum beats(save one typically tight Premo joint!)... If you like utterly boring hip hop with boring common beats, commonplace and insipid rhymes, and whack hooks...run out and get this ASAP. If not peep ""Things Fall Apart"" instead."
3,Not greatly recommended for gym enthusiastists,"--simple design, durable, and fun color.--however, the ""cron"" function does not work. Ironically, the reason I bought this watch was for gym purpose, such as measuring how long it takes me to run 3 miles. And since this function does not work, I end up not using this watch."
1,Don't waste your money,"Of the 65 minutes of this tape, you only get a 30 minute class which includes 10 minutes of meditation. The sound quality of the class is awful, I've seen much better quality HOME videos!"
1,THROW UP,"If YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF VOMIT BE MY GUEST. OR YOU CAN MIX WITH 5 BANANAS, BUT WHO WANTS TO BE TAKING A DUMP ALL DAY. WASTE OF MY MONEY."
1,taste disgusting!,"I lost weight with this product be cause it went through me like crap through a goose. Oh did i mention that it taste like it smells- like rotting and fermenting vegetables. Believe the reviews that talk about the taste. You can even mask it with the stuff they tell you to mix it with. If I had time to mix it with all those other fruits, then I wouldn't even need this stuff! Save your money. ""To add insult to injury"", I requested the free measuring spoon, and they never sent it. Cheapskates!I would definitely NEVER recommend to a friend! I would recommend it if you need a product to add to a practical joke."
2,Hard to swallow,This powdered meal may be good nutritionally and suit certain people. For me a liquid meal must disslove to a consistant liquid state. This product was lumpy at the bottom and a bit unpleasant to swallow. Maybe mixing it in a blender wwould help but i just used the shaker glass i mix my protein shakes in. I'll finish the product but will not buy again. I like to get a quick liquid nutrients in my in the morning and your stomache doesn't look forward to this product first thing before a shower. Making it the night before to set in watet in the refigerator helps but the last half a cup is tangible.
3,charge for shipping,"I ordered a bunch of suplements from another company but waited on this because it was cheaper here.Then, after clicking add to my cart, with free shipping on orders til the end of the month on a coupon on the shipping charges page, I discover I'll be charged over $8 for shipping, it's not an ""eligible item"".The vitamin cottage has wasted my time, won't waste my money, going back to the other website.I have used the product a lot and really like it, good in fruit smoothies."
5,"A Real Meal, for real","Having tried many different ways to make wholesome shakes, I landed up on the Ultimate Meal. After seeing it at Whole Foods, I was curious and bought the smaller container at first.The green makes it interesting and a little bland at first .. and then you improvise with different fruits and such. Before you know it, you are hooked, not because of it's taste but because of what it does for your body. I have one in the morning and I am stuffed till about noon. Going on a slow roll weight loss plan, this is a great addition to my diet.I have grown to like it a lot .. with a banana, apple, pears, honey dew or whatever other fruit I can lay my hands on. I have been recommending this to many of my friends who are 'growing' to like it."
4,Packed with Nutrition,"I've been consuming the Ultimate Meal now for about a month and have really come to appreciate the benefits of this product. There are no other products like this on the market that packs so much green nutrition into such a small serving, and the ingredients speak for themselves. I consume a serving for breakfast and another serving after my workout. This meal is the perfect choice for the health conscience person looking for the best nutrition in a convenient package. I would give it 5 Stars, but the taste takes some getting used to. I use natural apple sauce and a whole banana with a touch of honey most days. The smell reminds me of alfalfa hay, and the dark green color just screams high octane nutrition. I will continue consuming the Ultimate Meal and I recommend it."
4,Drink your barnyard juice!,"Okay, there's a first-time shock if you mix this with water and choke it down. Yup, it tastes like a barnyard smells. However, after that first time, you expect the taste, so it's really not that bad. Also, it's relatively easy to mask the taste in a fruit smoothie, or throw a heaping spoon into pea soup or something else that has a prominent taste of its own. Lends body and character, and gives your poop a healthy stink!"
5,Ultimate Breakfast,"I've tried numerous replacement meals for my morning shake, and this is by far the best one on the market. I say that not because it taste like a warm donut but because it taste as it looks....green. But the energy and feeling of fullness go a long way in my book. With this drink, and twice a day serving Monday - Friday, the extra 10 lbs I was trying to dump are long gone."
4,It taste better than it looks,"Granted, it is the worst looking health drink but it is not that bad tasting, if you do it right. My boyfriend gags when he sees me making the drink but if he'd taste it, you would realize it's good.After much trial and error, the key is lots of fruit, soy milk or yogurt and ice. A whole apple will help keep you full for several hours. I tried to make it once without an apple and I was hungry again by 2 or 3 PM. The great news is that your energy level will skyrocket and your will body start to crave it.-----------------------------------1/3 cup ice1/4 cup water1/3 cup soy milk or yogurt1 fiji apple1/2 medium banana1/3 ultimate meal powderhandful of blueberries or blackberriesIf I want it more sweet, I use juicy fruits like cantaloupe, pineapple or watermelon. Blend well.-----------------------------------I'm slowly trying to ween myself off the yogurt and soy milk and drink it as recommended but not yet."
3,"Upon further usage, not for me.","Initially, I purchased this and gave it 4 stars. After my 3rd tub however, I realized I felt drained for big portion of my day if I had this for breakfast. I know this product works for some, but I'm going to return to more traditional alternatives like oatmeal and fruit."
4,A good powder,"I use daily in fruit/ vegetable smoothies for breakfast. Great way to add bulk, protein and other nutrients for a total meal. Not the very best on the market, but you can't beat the price-point."
