1,Bad!,"This is one of the worst compilations in a history of glam rock.I like hard rock but Ratt is so far from the top.Only three songs sounds great:""Round and Round"",""Back for More"" and ""Givin'Yourself Away"",others sounds like music for the children and teens,because this songs is just for one period in yor life,nothing more.Groups like:Ratt,Poison,Warant and believe me Bon Jovi destroyed real hard rock.But today NEW Metal is something very seek and sad.And the real hard rock people needs a bands like:blue oyster cult,g'n'r,skid row,hanoi rocks,motley crue,ramones,thin lizzy,michael schenker group,iron maiden,aerosmith,scorpions,deep purple.....that's the music for all time."
5,"I tell ya, these guys have it and always will-excellent!","I think the cd is great, it includes music from later albums along with new, I think these guys will never go out of style."
4,Pretty Good Compilation,"Although it could be better, Ratt's first greatest hits album has pretty good song selection. The only problem is my personal favorite song ever by Ratt, Your'e In Trouble, has been left off on account of it wasn't released as a single. But other than that, all my favorite tracks are here, with lots from one of Ratt's best albums, Detonator. This is the album I would reccomend to any casual Ratt fan or beginner on the band."
5,Their Best !!! Must Be,"This is the best CD of RATT~ In Korea, the most famous LA metal band is MOTLEY CRUW & BON JOVI..so Many souls don't know 'bout this band RATT..but I think that RATT's twin guitar system best I ever heard..in rock history. and Bobby's drum also good~ 80's best band is RATT~ I'll try to let many Korean know RATT till I die~ God bless ROBBIN CROSBY in heaven.."
4,Way Cool.,"This is a great collection for any level of fan. A few songs may be missing, but at 19 tracks, it's hard to complain. Obviously this includes their biggest hit ""Round And Round"", which is on most ""hair"" collections as well. But this also has other awesome songs like ""Wanted Man"", ""You're In Love"", ""Lovin' You's A Dirty Job"", and ""Nobody Rides For Free"", which was on the ""Point Break"" soundtrack. One of my personal favorites is ""Way Cool Jr."". I must have played that a thousand times in high school. Overall, this is an excellent collection, from one of the better bands of the genre. One listen and you'll be ""Back For More""."
4,a great album!,"i agree with all, about this album bringing old days back. 'Reach for the sky' was my first ratt album back in the 90's and i had fallen in love with the band instantly. i really didn't have all the ratt albums but when i bought this one it sort of expanded my prospective of the band. i thought they ruled the glam rock era back then. though i really don't dig steven(vocalist)'s voice, but his style i thought standardized a glam rock star's vocal sound. the guitar playing is really really good. much like dokken, europe, winger etc....Except the songs from their first album 'tell the world' and 'you think you're tough' the rest rocks. the songs that i kept incessantly listening to were BODY TALK and I WANT A WOMAN. 'I want a woman' should be the epitomy of glam rock. anyways all in all it's a great album."
5,this is by far the greastest cheese metal best of,ratt is by far the most under rated band of the 80's. the vocals by stephen pearcy are amazing and i can't say enough about warren de martini and his guitar work. if you loved 80's rock then this is the best out there
5,This book couldn't be put down.,"I thought is was extremely sad! This isn't one you want to miss. I've read every single one of the SVU books, and this was one of the most heartfelt romantic and tragic one of them all. Be prepared to read the book in one sitting! I can't wait till the next book comes out!"
1,Very disappointed~,I purchased this at the target store back in March and all I can say is that is very disappointing. I use it in the kitchen and it just does not do the job aa it should. I will be purchasing something else and it definately won't be this one. Dirt Devil you need to do better~
1,Save your money!,I was so disappointed with this vacuum that I returned it for the Extreme Power Stick which I love!
5,S Club At The Tops,"This is a great import single by one of Britain's hottest, S Club 7. NEVER HAD A DREAM COME TRUE is a great ballad with nice slow & steady beats and Jo on vocals, a really beautiful song. PERFECT CHRISTMAS is a fabulous Christmas song, usually pop stars' Christmas anthems are usually sleazy, but this makes it all seem better. The Almighty Remix of REACH is one of their best remixes, it is a little slow though. I would reccomend the original version too. This is a fabulous CD, BUY IT and i guarantee you will love it."
5,Solid sound...you wont be disappointed,I ended up with three (3) of these units. Easy to install and the sound is solid. I paired it up with an HSU subwoofer and have been very happy. The mounting was easy and I had no issues with the entire setup.
1,Simply a story coming from an illiterate Bapsi Sidhwa.,The book is nothing but a waste of time and if anything else a way to let out Muslim hate toward any other religion. It simply has no historical meaning because of its way of potraying the scene that was so hard on the real patriotic population of India. It seems like Sidhwa only writes this book to live in some kind of a hallucination and denial to get away from the fact that the whole reason for the pain in the partition was non other than her beloved Muslim population. Reading this book will never in a million years give anyone the true picture of the real partition but to be honest it has good writing style.
3,Cracking India?,"Why did Bapsi Sidhwa change the name of the novel from ""Ice Candy Man"" to ""Cracking India""? Maybe because it is more catchy and sells better. And does the cracking refers to the partition? If so it should have been Cracked India? Or is it a snide reference to separatist movements in India. Anyway its a tasteless title and although I liked the novel I do not like her sales tactics!"
5,The tribute to the greates band ever!!!!!,This movie was fantastic. It shows all of the Sublime vidoes you see on MTV plus a couple you may have never seen. If your a Sublime fan this video is a must buy.
1,Not Imperialism or Imperialism II,"This game is not like the Imperialism games. It is like Risk played with Stratego pieces and Monopoly buildings. The combat consists of a computer generated dice roll. It is a turn based game, but it was repetive. I found it very disappointing, perhaps it is for pre-teens."
1,Caused rash that led to staph infection,"After using the wipes for awhile both my sons developed an itch. At the time we didn't put 2 and 2 together. My youngest sons itch was so bad I took him to the doctor and she said it looked like ringworm and told me to get foot fungus cream. I did mention to her that I thought it might be the wipes but, she didn't think it was the cause. Well, after using the fungal cream for two weeks (the doctor said it could take up to a month for the ringworm to go away) the itching got worse and the rash spread. I took him back to the doctor and she took a culture swab and we found out he has a staph infection caused by the itching! So no more wipes and nobody itches anymore. It could just be that my boys were sensitive to the ingredients in the wipes but, I did notify Kleenex about what happened with us and am waiting to hear back from them. If your child is prone to skin allergies I would HIGHLY recommend NOT using these wipes."
3,good value,"I've bought these from Amazon for a long time. At one point they had them on a continuous free shipping option. I think that was discontinued though. However, buying these in bulk are a great deal with free prime shipping and very convenient. The only problem I have with the product is that the continuous connected wipes tend to rip apart in the dispenser all the time. Then you have to rethread them thru the top. A little inconvenient."
2,Too Rough..,"Wow.. these Cottonelle Fresh Folded Moist Wipes Tub 42, are about the size of a Kleenex, and they're pretty rough on your backside. The small size alone makes them not at all useful for anything but a babies bum, but the texture's too rough to use on your baby. The name Cottonelle implies soft; these wipes are anything but.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,Was not what I ordered,I ordered a dress; I received a pair of paints. I have not returned it because I had so much trouble receiving the paints that I have just decided to keep it and give it to someone and take tax credit on it. I will never order from these people again.Linda Revels
2,Remy Zero fan's perspective,"I bought this CD because I was looking for some continuation of Remy Zero's sound. I'm not really familiar with The Church, so Church fans please don't be upset with me. I only gave this two stars because I gave Spartan Fidelity's Excava 11 one star and this is a little better than that CD. The thing I didn't really like about this CD was the lack of structure. I prefer songs to have a verse, chourus, bridge, and so on. This was very free form. Also, I can't hum any of the songs for anyone. That's because there weren't any distinctive riffs or hooks that make any of the songs memorable, much like Spartan Fidelity. It also seemed a little over produced, lots of technology. All the drums seemed electronic, for all I know they were. I wasn't thrilled, but then again I'm not a Church fan, as a Remy Zero fan I was dissappointed. Such is life."
2,Annotated bibliography,"Despite its title, this book does not really provide a thorough examination of the moral treatment of returning warriors in the early medieval period. Verkamp has made a survey of other people's studies of medieval theological writings, so the notes in the back of this book are helpful. The same can be said of Verkamp's material on ""modern times."" The end notes point to resources that I hope will provide a deeper exploration of society's core beliefs towards veterans after ancient and modern wars."
5,"Second Only to ""Europe '72"" in the Dead's Live Catalogue","Great music. Although the songs aren't as strong as some of the songs on ""Europe '72"" they are still great. Also, there is a much wider range of styles on this record (proving just how versatile the Dead were). There's your folky stuff (Going Down the Road and Feeling Bad), your blues-wailin' (Turn on Your Lovelight), your good old-fashioned rock 'n' roll (One More Saturday Night), and, of course, your psychedelia (Cryptical Envelopement). The highlight of this record (for me at least) has to be the wonderful Playing in the Band. Great stuff."
4,More From the '72 European Tour,"There are a wealth of releases from the Dead's seminal tour of Europe in 1972, including ""Europe '72,"" ""Rockin' the Rhein,"" and ""Steppin' Out."" Each has its own virtues, and so does ""Hundred Year Hall."" Recorded at the Jahrhunderthalle in Frankfurt, this show features a nice mix of snappy, shorter numbers (""Me and My Uncle,"" ""Big Railroad Blues,"" and a great version of ""One More Saturday Night"") along with some terrific jams, most notably on the 18-minute ""Truckin'"" and the 36-minute ""Cryptical Envelopment."" Pigpen doesn't sound too good on the 19-minute ""Turn On Your Lovelight"" (this was only one month before he last sang publicly), but the jamming is fantastic. The liner notes by Dead lyricist Robert Hunter are also weird and wonderful. On the whole, a good live selection for Dead afficianados as well as those who are new to the experience."
4,Listen to the drums on set 2!,The only thing I have to add to the mix of what's already been said is that Bill K is on fire on Cryptical Envelopment and the jam in the second set. The drums are always great but listen to this! It's unreal!
4,"Great music, but incomplete","This release is a good example from 1972. Pigpen's on his last go round and, his organ is frustratingly buried in the mix. You hear flashes of it in the Other one, but that's about it. Great material and superbly done. However, I'm glad David Ganz broadcast the outtakes from this release on the Dead Hour. There was a lot of great material not issued and I'm still scratching my head wondering why. Two Souls In Communion is still needing to be released on something. Should've been on this. Still, a pretty good indication of what other parts of Europe 72 were like.PK"
4,A Lovelight Highlight,"This CD is one that every dead head should have in their collection. It starts off with a strong Bertha, though I have heard better, and goes on from there. The best song on the first disc is Lovelight->GDTRFB. This lovelight is the best I have heard either live, on an album, or tape. Lovelight->GDTRFB is worth the price all by itself. Drop everything, listen and enjoy, you will be impressed. They play a little bit of Not Fade intro but Jerry suddenly takes the band down the road, makes you wonder what happed. The second disc is solid and well done, but my belief is that it is not as strong as the first set. That is why I only gave it four stars."
5,Classic,"It was one of the best Greatful Dead cd's ever, you won't be disappointed with the sound and it is much more than expected"
3,Nice,"I thought that this book was a very nice book but, I didn't get a chance to finish it, so I'm getting some notes to help me out on the report. It wouldn't be fair for me to give a full review on the book because I haven't fininshed it yet. Wish me luck on finishing the book."
5,This CD is amazing because it reflects many of my ideal in l,"This cd is very cool. I especialy like the song ""Ni nuestros Hombres"". This guitar strokes are killer and the lyrics polishes the song. My favorite song indeed. Rock en Espanol rules!"
1,Pura bazofia,"This cd is a waste of time. Forget about this pathetic band, and spend your money on something better"
4,al tanto review,This product was as good as the seller said it would be. the book was in good condition and it was clean.
1,horrible modern remixes all sound the same,"If you're a fan of old disco music (like I am), then you'll know many of these songs in their original mixes. At this point, at least, Amazon has 30 second sound samples available for the tracks on this cd. Give a listen and you'll understand why I chose ""horrible modern remixes all sound the same"" for my review title. Basically, the people who remixed these tracks ended up putting cookie-cutter rhythm tracks on all of the tracks, robbing them of their melodic structure and their individual charms. Sometimes I like modern remixes, but these miss the mark entirely."
3,"GOOD RECIPES, GREAT CONCEPT","The strong points of this book are the concept of blood type and diet, and the nutritious recipes. Whether one is trying to lose or maintain weight, or simply choosing their foods more carefully because they are health conscious, the book is beneficial. This book, like Dr. Peter D'Adamo's ""Eat Right"" series is based on the concept of eating right for your blood type.The downside of the book is that I found some parts contradictory and the book just did not come together as anticipated. The reader may be confused by some of the combination of foods. Overall, it is a book worth reading because the concept of blood type and diet is sound; however, my preference on the topic of blood type and diet is still Dr. D'Adamo's books (""Eat Right 4 Your Blood Type, Cook Right 4 Your Blood Type and Live Right 4 Your Blood Type"") they are all absolutely superb and highly recommended."
1,Not Food Combined,"I was very excited to find this book as it combined the two approaches to eating that I find supportive. However, while the author shows charts and diagrams that explain food combining, the recipes and meal plans she provides are far from following food combining guidelines. I was dumbfounded by this inconsistency. While writing that food combining's basic tenant is to avoid mixing protein and carbohydrates, the suggested breakfast is an egg and toast! The references for food combining are excellent but the practical day to daya advice for implementing a food-combined/blood-typed diet should be avoided."
5,Most beautiful sketches of Venice,"This is by far the most beautiful book of watercolored, ink and pencil sketches of Venice. A wonderful remembrance if you've been lucky enough to visit or like me, a beautiful book to relish and enjoy.Venice Sketchbook (Sketchbook Series)"
3,Mediocre,The book is a great discussion started but hardly resolves any of the problems it presents.
5,Love It!!,"Love it, love it, love it. I've decided there is nothing better than taking a shower by moonlight. This ""tub"" captures the water to where you can direct the flow away from the Teepee or you can actually capture the gray water for disposal. There is a drainage hole that you put on the low side so that the water can flow out or preferably attach a hose and you can direct the water to flow a few feet away for the Teepee."
5,If my kids can't break it.....,"We bought 2 of these for our girls for Christmas 2006. They were 7 & 8 at the time. We spend a lot of time in the car, and in the summer they go on the road with dad in the semi. I lost count of how many times they've been dropped, left in the car in 20 below weather, and generally had the crap beat out of them. Other than the dog eating the car charger on one, and the battery latch not holding really tight, they have been wonderful. The picture is as good today as when it was new. I would definitely buy this unit again."
1,A fool and his money are soon parted.,"Not just one, but two of Polaroids portable DVD players were purchased less than a year ago. Both quit spinning the DVD in the 13th month within a few days of each other. What do you do with a working LCD screen and no player? Nothing. It's crap. Don't buy Polaroid!!!"
1,Don't buy this piece of junk!,"We bought this and were happy with the picture but could barely hear it. However, it broke after only a few months so we got a replacement. That one lasted maybe 20 short car rides and won't work anymore. I have seen a lot of similar reviews on other sites so my advice is to look for another brand."
4,"MMM, MMM, Good.","It just recently picked up this 10 year old album, and once I gave it a few spins I was thouroughly impressed. The songs are well crafted, smart catchy pop. Of course there's the singers deep voice too, which they're almost known for the most. This whole disc is good, but the first 5 tracks alone make this worth getting. It's actually hard not to smile and sing along to a few of them. This includes their biggest hit ""MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM"", but many of the tracks are like that one. I suspect this is the best cd from these dummies."
4,90's classic,"We bought (well, rebought) this album after album remembering the title song was good. We had forgot how good many of the other songs were. It's really a good album if you haven't heard it before. As I recall, the follow up album to this one was not good."
3,wrong genre,This singer should consider doing death vocals with a more interesting band. He's the only good thing about this album. Maybe for Deicide when Glen Benton kills himself on his 33rd birthday.
5,Quite simply a masterpiece,"Well, I don't know how this passed me by for so long. Released 1993. I caught ""MMM MMM MMM MMM"" on the radio very recently. Found out that it was from this album and bought it.One of my better purchases ! There are very few albums that can be enjoyed from start to finish - This more than measures up. Pure musical artistry - The quirky and intelligent lyrics remind me very much of Eels. Excellent production, just a gem.It just feels good to have this in my music collection."
3,They'd always just been there,"The Crash Test Dummies have a really original sound. They have unique instrumentation, plus a bass singer as a lead vocalist. Singer Brad Roberts also writes songs that are different than anybody else's. This, their second album, contains their unlikely hit, ""Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm"". If you heard that song and like it, you will probably enjoy the rest of their album."
4,Before It All Went Horribly Wrong...,"This is the CTD that most of us knew and loved - beautiful harmonies, tongue-in-cheek lyrics and Brad's amazing voice. This is the only CTD album worth buying."
1,Don't waste your time!,"The only reason I got this CD was for Mmm mmm mmm, which is the only remotely decent song on this album, and even that got old after about the 3rd time I heard it. The rest of the songs are terrible and barely qualify as music."
3,Are u kidding me,"This cd is horrible. The lyrics are the worst ever, even i can think of better songs than them. The music is so stpuid, it's funny. I rated 3 stars because it is so bad, it's funny. But if it didn't have funny lyrics, i'd rate it 1 star. It is an ok cd if u are tired and want to fall asleep, or if you are bored and don't have any thing to listen too."
5,Not all baroque sounds like Bach,"This excellent recording treats us to a different baroque. Not the extremely elaborate fugues, chorales, and operas most people immediately think of when they hear ""baroque"". Many of the pieces are dance music, but not the kind of dances you would find in Bach cello, violin or lute suite. This is music someone can actually dance to. Even though the music is definitely baroque, some of these pieces sound like flamenco (like Jacaras por la E), and some other sounds like South American music (La Jota sounds somehow like ""pajaro campana"").A discussion of the Alfabeto letters that show up in the titles of the pieces would have been nice; when you see ""por la E"" or ""por la B"" Murcia did not mean in the key of E or in the key of B. He was reffering to the names of the main chord in each of the pieces by an old guitar-chord naming system.Highly recommended."
5,Perfect fan for hard drive,"I own a 3.5"" hard drive enclosure in which the fan died (apparently, a common defect of that specific product). This fan was the perfect replacement, it fit in the tight space and works like a charm. It's as quiet as a fan can be, and the hard drive is adequately cooled.And for less than $3, you can't beat the price and convenience of this product."
5,Parrot horn,Love this horn. Cute and loud. Not just for kids- also for 60 year old adults! Makes me smile! Your friends will have horn envy .
5,My macaw fell in love,"This parrot horn is humorous, well sculpted, and a good size. It never made it onto the bike as the macaw fell in love with it. The company was a pleasure to deal with. We received the horn promptly, in a sturdy package."
5,an excellent cd,"Hello, I bought this cd not knowing what to expect and this music blew me away.this is a must cd for your library"
3,Jars of Clay,"Jars of Clay is a very good group. I would recomond them to any of my friends(and I have) They're pop/rock w/a very strong message. But they're not a bash-you-over-the-head-with-it-type of band, which I like. Over all, an excellent choice for anyone."
1,KEEP FASTFORWARD BUTTON PRESSED,"Wingrave is a ghost hunter who is asked to contact the dead brother a woman who desperately needs to contact him. They hold a seance. The movie is divided into chapters much like a book. The initial part is done in black and white. When they say ""English-language"" film, what they mean is written English, like a silent movie. Wingrave speaks his thoughts at times in the movie, clearly a later dub. When people speak you do not hear any language at all, only background music. Then you see a screen with what they said, like in the old silents. Sometimes the writing describes things which you can hear and see happening, such as a door bell ringing. There are no special effects worth watching. No blood, no gore, no sex, no nudity, no swearing, just a bad movie. It is a rip off at any price, so I'll be selling my copy on E-Bay. Don't ask me how it ends."
5,great rod,"i partnered this rod with a shimano citica. used twice catched ocean perch, opal eye, sargo, sheepshead aboard a 3/4 day party boat off Catalina Island California. this piece is light and sensitive yet strong. highly recommended."
5,"5 stars, with an asterisk","These discs are not for the faint of heart. I bought this when it came out expecting something akin to One From the Vault which I fell in love with instantly. I was terribly disappointed. It wasn't until years later that I fell in love with the late-60s Dead which IMO is a totally different beast than mid-70s, 80s, and early 90s. Of course the songs are long- there's only 4 per disc for crying out loud. But almost every song is a tight jam. If you want to hear Sugar Mag, go elsewhere. But this has become one of my favorites."
2,5 stars (with an asterisk),"These discs are not for the faint of heart. I bought this when it came out expecting something akin to One From the Vault which I fell in love with instantly.

3,NOT A SPECTACULAR TWO DISC SET,"DEADHEADS HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERATE THE MATERIAL. THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR COLLECTION. IT CONTAINS SOME RATHER TIRESOME JAMS, BE SURE YOU HAVE SOME TIME AND PATIENCE ON HAND IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THIS. IF YOUR A NOVICE TAKE EUROPE 72 ANY DAY OVER THIS."
3,No surprises here,"The reissue of Let It Happen seems strange to me. Of all the albums to re-release, I would have expected one of their better-selling albums along with demos of the songs found on that album. Personally, I like original LIH better, but lets face it, you're not buying this because you want to hear about 20 early B-sides remastered. You're buying it because you're a hardcore MxPx fan and need all of their cds. I would say that no real MxPx fan would want to be without their catalog of music videos, which is almost worth the price of the cd. The three new tracks are good, not just throw-ins. Hey, it's a better deal than Ten Years And Running."
5,Amazing Re-Release,"If you don't have Let It Happen already BUY THIS NOW. If you do have Let It Happen already BUY THIS NOW. All three of the new songs are brilliant, great rocking tracks that put everything off of ""Let's Rock"" to shame. This has all the original songs off of Let It Happen, AND includes a DVD with all the band's music videos. This is a must have, and a great deal for the price."
5,greatness,"I recently had the person who got me into mxpx and punk in general say she hated me. I popped this CD in, and immediately felt better. Whether you are in a good mood or are really sad for losing a loved one, this cd is the one to listen to. With tracks like gsf, rock and roll girl, circumstance, and begin to start, this CD has something for everyone"
3,Well...,"This is a good comp. But i dont particulary care that much for mxpx. To me they sound to soft, and most of the time they have no real view expressed. All the songs are about chasing girls. I didn't like this CD. But if you like MxPx you most likely will."
2,ehh,"I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything about punk but i've been listening for a couple months now and I know what I like and what I don't like. I am afraid I don't like this album, mainly because every song sounds the same. If it weren't for my favorite MxPx songs, ""Chick Magnet"" ""Let It Happen"" ""Do Your Feet Hurt"" and in my opinion the best, ""Life In General,"" I would never listen to this cd. So what it comes down to is don't buy the cd, download any songs that someone has recommended."
5,Rawkin Punk Rawk,This is one of MxPx's best CD's ever. This CD has some of the best guitar ever heard. If you like punk rawk the slightest bit you've gotta get this CD. With 32 songs you'll have plenty of sweet music for a very long time.
3,I have heard better from MxPx,MxPx is my fav band I own almost all of their cd's and i must say this is the worst! I have given all the other cd's of theirs 5 stars and 4 stars but i am forced to give this cd 3!
5,A rare gem....,"It's worth getting for the first 3 tracks on the cd. However, there are plenty of more good songs on the entire album to enjoy."
5,This CD Rocks!,"I am a huge fan of this band, but that had nothing to do with why I purchased this CD. First of all, this the the only CD by them that you can buy at major retail chain stores like Target. I was kind of worried by that. But being a huge fan and having all their other CD's, I got it, and as usual, it rocked. My favorite song is GSF, but the whole CD is good. There are so many tracks and such a variety of songs on there, that everyone I know has found something they like about this CD.MXPX is a great band, and I know tons of people who lable it ""christian music."" Well, this isn't. Nobody's preaching to you on this CD and the music is super good. Everyone should check it out."
4,mikes review,THIS CD WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES I'E EVER BOUGHT IT'S REALLY COOL AND IT'S VERY GREAT FOR ROAD TRIPS! SUPPORT THIS AWESOME BAND!!!
4,Not as good as the others,"Now i can see why this is a collection of B-sides. Although still very good, it doesnt compare to the other albums like TEPM and SGTWOTB. It has some really great fast songs and some other really good slower songs. The faster include ""Lifetime Enlightenment"", ""Thoughts And Ideas"", and ""Small Town Minds"", while the good slower songs include ""Let It Happen"", ""Rock And Roll Girl"" and ""Elvis Is Dead"". This album pretty much has something for everyone, even including some pretty neat demo versions of other songs like ""Chick Magnet"". While not as good as the real songs, these are still fun to listen to. All in all, a new MxPx should start out with The Everpassing Moment."
5,"very impressive, very fun","well, this is my first MXPX cd, and i haven't heard the others yet, but i can't wait. i love all of the songs -- it's great that there's such variety and yet it all works together and sounds so good. favorites are never learn and gsf. their lyrics are a lot cleaner than the other punk bands, and i appreciate that. they have something that the others don't- a combo of good music and good lyrics."
4,"Fast and upbeat, Some great songs.",The music ranged from bad to great. I just have to say that the good out weighed the bad.
4,Awesome,This Cd is awesome and trust me i'm not a great fan of MxPx but i think this Cd is really worth it. My fave songs are Never Kearn and Chick Magnet.
3,"This album is solid, and MxPx is awesome!","Hey all, this CD, by one of my fave bands, MxPx, is pretty good. Even though there are about half-and-half good and bad songs, the good ones are so good they weigh out the bad. If you like MxPx, you should get this album, it's solid, with awesome songs, and some weak ones. Best 4 tracks:1,2,16,27. This is good, but Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo is better."
3,good comp,"(3.5, actually) this is a good compiliation of some of Mxpx's work. I'd have to say i prefer ""Live:At the Show"" and ""Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo"", though. even so, this album is much more raw than the latter."
5,This CD is one of the best I own,this cd contains best of the old stuff with an added bonus of the demo versions
2,Metamorphosis: Beyond the Green Door,"I love Kafka and remember really enjoying this film (it's an adaptation of Kafka's ""Le Metamorphosis""). This will be going in my trash as soon as I'm done, it's an avant-garde interpretation film about Kafka's Metamorphosis. An amalgam of everything Kafka ever did and he wasn't one to object to revealing what his life was about.In order to tell the story Gregor's life in film format, ground had to be broken and they had to try to sell the film so as to be understandable to the non-psychotic mind.Naturally, the bug is the focus of the story, and the result is a marvelous looking picture, with a wonderful score, but it lacks any (with the exception of Kafka's story) dramatic punch."
5,"Very happy, Organic, and No Harmful GMOs.....","My dog is very sensitive to anything with meat since she was born. I have always fed her natural balance Vegan. I became aware of genetically modified ingredients and called natural balance and asked if they had any GMOs in their food and they told me no. I am skeptical since the rice in the united stated is now becoming GMO and many other hidden ingredients including vitamins. I found this product and was very happy its Organic, I started feeding my dog the food and she is very picky and loved it. I will be transferring her food to this one since its organic. Very happy customer and dog!"
5,Great product,"After trying several luminizers, I'm so glad I bought this one! I agree with the previous reviewer that it's a teensy sparkly, but not glittery at all (like Urban Decay). I also agree you should watch where you put it...put it on large pores or flaws, and they will for sure be luminous. But it's definitely not a reason to shy away from a great product. Just don't apply to the entire face and be sure to blend. You'll have a beautiful, luminous glow (maybe more radiant, actually) that looks like super-healthy, exfoliated skin.It's also not greasy (I have oily skin), and it stays on forever. I really love this product!"
5,"A ""Must Have"" Working Guide for all men over 50!","This is a wonderful resource for all men aged 50 and over, whether or not you have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. It is organized in a very logical format, from normal male anatomy and physiology to the problems men have which are ""benign"" and then goes into the entire work-up, diagnosis, treatment and survival options for men with prostate cancer. It has an unbelievable index and is filled with useful information for finding a physician that will listen to your needs and wishes. I especially liked the chapter on diet and nutrition. The entire book is easy to read and understand and is surprisingly positive and hopeful. I was fortunate to receive this book from my doctor, but I am buying and recommending them for everyone I know, now."
1,Old edition - do not buy here,"1999 edition, not the current 2009 edition, should not be sold by anyone, and should not be purchased by anyone looking for current information on prostate cancer. Returned and had to purchase new edition locally."
3,Different Approach,"It's hard to find a good study guide on Philippians. Kay's normal approach is to have the reader do all of the structured study on their own. In this busy world, it's hard to find the time for cooking for scratch approach. I prefer Irving Jensen's do-it-yourself studies that make it a bit easier. Unfortunately, he didn't do one for Philippians."
4,a native's perspective,"This is a novel inspired by historical data, not an historical account. The author clearly states this in the afterward and acknowledgments. Compelling, disturbing, and perhaps most meaningful to someone familiar with The City, or with roots there. My grandmother was about the age of the narrator, so for me it had a more personal feeling, as if I was afforded a window into her life."
4,A Burning Issue,"""1906"" is a compelling novel that has overtones on today's political scene.I got into it and it wouldn't let go. Dalessandro does a great organizational job with nicely developed and realized action. Colorful characters and scenes abound. Reads almost as if it might be a film plot. Get it!It will haunt you.It proves that history can be compelling and instructional. Brooklyn doesn't have all the excitement.John Manbeck, former Brooklyn Borough Historian"
5,What a story!,"I love to read a book which causes me to talk out loud. To laugh in agreement, to call out a warning, or to read aloud a line which I enjoyed. I don't have a lot of extra reading time, and want a book which immediately involves me emotionally because the character and plot are so well developed. 1906 was definitely the type of book I enjoy. Most of all I can say that the book was suspenseful -- I couldn't put it down wanting to know what was happening with each of the characters and the intricate weaving of their lives. I very much enjoyed the book!"
1,"The disaster of ""1906""","1906 was incredibly disappointing. The topic of San Francisco's 1906 earthquake seemed so interesting and full of possibilities that I really looked forward to reading this novel. However, I can't say it was worth picking up. It was written with no thought to character development and with descriptions that were really of lists of mundane details rather than anything designed to create mental images. When I discussed the book with a friend, we agreed that it seemed more like a cheap Hollywood movie (a disaster film with themes of revenge and a romantic subplot) than anything resembling literature. I'm not at all suprised to see another reviewer bring up that the book is being made into a movie. In my opinion, that's why it was written in the first place."
3,"OK, but not ""ground-breaking""","I agree with the other review here that says this has ""movie treatment"" written all over it. There IS a movie in production now. I've seen the author as a ""talking head expert"" in a couple of documentaries on the 1906 quake (by the way, if you want the BEST documentary on the SF 1906 quake, get ""Disaster by the Bay: The Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906."" You can find it here on amazon. It's hands-down the best documentary on the quake and fire, and takes you into the real heart of the story. Stay AWAY from the National Geographic Documentary, it has the author of this novel in it, and it's pretty cheesy.) Anyway, the book is an OK read."
5,I devoured this book!,"Reading this book as a San Franciscan was amazing. The history, landmark references, and captivating plot filled with colorful characters connected me even more to my hometown. I find that many of my friends are unfamiliar with the Spring of 1906, and this book has given me a springboard to strike up a historical lecture with them all!"
1,amazingly shallow book...,"I can't believe I read the same book as these other reviewers - how could this book be worthy of 4-5 stars?? It was long on name-dropping, short on facts, and incredibly shallow. It was like reading People magazine - satisfying while waiting in the dentist's office or on a long flight, then completely forgettable. I was dazzled by what I thought was its potential. If you really want to read it, get it from the library or borrow it from someone; it is NOT worth paying for..."
5,Fire and Brimstone,"Mr. Dalessandro writes about San Francisco's 1906 quake and its linked political corruption so masterfully that I instantly saw the fault lines above ground and below. Here are city fathers who make Boss Tweed look like a Boy Scout, an infrastructure gone to hell, and a disaster waiting to happen. Dalessandro knows the city inside out, and the narrative integrates the massive quake with the politics by using a first person voice - a newspaper woman of the day - who invisibly slips offstage when omniscience is needed. The quake and its progress through the city on multiple fronts, the fires, explosions, and mass death, the local color and the dumb decisions which made it all worse, all show a research effort which must have required a war room to orchestrate.."
1,What a waste!,"First of all, I'm shocked at those other reviews. They must be 'plants' from the publisher because this was truly one of the worst books I've ever read. I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and this seemed like a great scenario. But the writing is horrific. The author can't string a coherent sentence together. But worse, I blame the editor for this mess. Having the point of view shift in mid-paragraph is not only infuriating, it's complete incompetence. Do yourself a favor and skip this!!"
5,Forbidden Fruit: love stories from the underground railroad,"I was hooked on this one when I picked it up. I was just going to read a paragraph or two to see how it reads. The next thing I knew the phone was ringing, and when I answered the phone, I realized that I had been reading for a couple of hours. I had to control my urges to pick up the book when I had appointments or other things I needed to do first. It is a really interesting read. And it reads well also."
1,"Self-Publishing, a race to the bottom?","It is with no hesitance that I say, strongly, do not purchase this book. The volume is little more than an honors paper in a quality high school, exhibiting a familiarity with specialized terms and the ability to assemble a bibliography. There is no substantive analysis validating the title, and definitely no support for the subtitle which indicates support for school vouchers. Most readers will remember the ""Sokal Affair"" where a scientist parodied cultural studies authors and had it accepted in their top journal. One could imagine this piece attempting to be placed in the same position with its over the top style; but its visible superficiality denies one even that latitude. In the expanding instant and self publishing marketplace, those houses which grace these volumes with their imprimature need to exercise some editorial discretion if they and their authors do not want to be caught in a race to the bottom of the vanity presses."
5,AT THEIR BEST,"This concert is an example of the Dead @ the top of their game.Playing a small venue with their hottest fans present,they shine.High points are great Help on the way-Franklin's Tower and Eyes of the World. Sound quality is studio quality,must have especially for 70's Dead fans."
3,a classic show.,"This was the Dead's comeback show after a six month hiatus. It was a private concert for radio execs to promote the the bands new album ""Blues for Allah."" A bootleg of this show was widely circulated for many years and was considered by a few to be among the Dead's finest shows. With the release of ""From the Vault"" you can now own a crispy multi-track copy of the show on disc. Listening to these discs on a hi-fi with headphones is a real thrill: the separation of each instrument and voice is very impressive. The Help>Slipknop>Frankin opener is quite good. As is this version of Eyes of the World. I don't care for the performances of some of these songs (Suguree comes to mind). The band seems a bit stiff at certain points. But over all this this is a nice set to listen to, especially in such a sharp format."
5,The Best CD that I own,"Most CDs have one or two good songs, but every song on this CD is a hit. I would rate it as the best CD of George Beverly Shea and my favorite CD."
5,Excellent story,Didn't want to put the book down. I felt like I was paddling down the coastline with the author and his pals. Great sense of humor throughout the book. Beautiful color pictures helped bring the story to life for me. I highly recommend it.
1,misled,"The author's friends must have written the other reviews of this book. There was one comparison to Hemingway that turns my stomach. The book was about several friends engaged in a couple of disjointed weekend paddling trips. The editorial description made it sound like there was an actual expedition down the coast of california and into mexico when in fact the trip was done over several different weekends. I don't have any heartburn with how they conducted their trip, what I do mind is that it was misrepresented in the book's description. I was led to believe that it was a serious sea kayaking book not a short story about a group of friends staying in hotels and paddling a couple of hours to the next surfing spot."
5,Real People Making Life and Adventure Happen!!!,"Creating a fact-based adventure book, filled with honesty and humor, is not easy, but the author does a remarkable job of bringing this journey along the California coastline to life. The paddlers on this trip are real people, with annoying quirks, a fondness for harmless, boyish antics, and an amazing insight into human nature. The honesty, comedy, and excitement of this book never outshine the author's deep-rooted message... pick-up a paddle and make your adventure!"
4,Delicious,"This was near to perfection. I would have preferred a slightly higher cocoa content, but overall this bar was quite delicious! The raspberries, in this case freeze-dried, made the perfect compliment to the chocolate, and had an excellent mouth feel and melt. I would give it four and a half stars if it let me!"
4,It Simplty Works,"John B. is correct; being consistent is key to anything, especially in getting results. You work right along with him and he suggests pausing when needed; once you've gotten thru the 3rd workout, you will feel more comfortable with adding more weight. I also love his meal instruction section. The time goes by reality quick; you feel as if you have your own personal trainer and you don't even need to leave home! If you feel the need to warm up, just do it--I just do a few stretches and then start right in. Good luck all.__________________Hey all, this is just an update. After doing this for a month, about 3-4 times weekly, I visited my friend in Maryland and happened to see myself in her large mirror.....I noticed a body I finally liked. My thighs were toned, tighter, more shapely too. It was almost as if things had gone back to where they use to be (smiles). It just gets better."
2,Very Basic,"This would be good for beginners, but a little too basic for me. He's a little bit too cheesy for me."
1,Not a good workout,"I did not care for it. The man does deep knee-bends? That is terrible on the knees, add the weights and you have just compounded the problem. He also had no warm-up or cool-down at all.All in all not a good circuit workout. I would suggest Cathe Friedrich or Jari Love.Kim"
3,Ehhh,"This book was ok, but I think most people already know the advice it has to give. Rather than reading this book, I think I'd be better off spending my time meeting people on an Internet dating site like match.com or catch27.com...these sites have more chance of curing my romance blues!"
5,The Best Dating Book I've Ever Read,"Let's face it, there are a lot of dating books out there, and even more relationship books. I've read a lot of them, but this book stands out from the crowd. It's as interesting as a good novel, but it's full of great information. After reading at least 6 other dating/relationship books, I was amazed at how much new information was in this book.If I had to recommend just one dating book to the millions of singles out there, this would be the book! If you can't find love after reading Dating 101, you're really not trying.I especially like how Ms. Darnay makes everything so easy to understand. No ""psychological mumbo jumbo"" from her. Only straight talk from a real professional. My life changed immediately after reading it! I'm now more self-confident and am bombarded with women who want to date me. Life is good!!"
5,Amazing must-read for singles everywhere,"This book is jam packed with information that is critical for finding love. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
5,Detailed and funny although serious,"A good surprise that makes this bio even when it's over 600 pages, almost impossible to stop reading.Well documented, Tony Fletcher takes the distance that any biographer should have and only bases this book upon facts and extracts of interviews with people that Keith had contact with, friends, and musicians.I'm almost sad that I'm about to end reading it..."
5,An emotional roller-coaster of a book--but a great ride!,"It seems that Tony Fletcher has come as close as a biographer can to capturing the chaos and magnificence of Keith Moon. Though I obviously knew the tragic end was coming, I still felt a sense of loss because the author's portrayal of Moon as a person was so intimate and compelling.When I listen to the same songs I have loved for years, I hear Keith's personality and talent coming through more loudly than ever after reading this book."
1,You get what you pay for,"In the Brandenburg Concerti, the tempo varies, trumpet volleys sound like French Horns, and the flute is off tune half the time. The harpsichordist was good but in one of the concerti, decided to enter at a different tempo than had been set by the rest of the orchestra. Since he had to play some very fast runs later, it is no surprise that he wanted to slow down the orchestra, but maybe they should have worked it out earlier. The orchestra sounds leaderless and out of sync at times. Can't find the groove. Violins are competent but playing with an orchestra that needs to practise what they are going to play a little more.That covers the first 2 of 40 CDs. Don't know if I can bring myself to listen to the rest. Somebody who didn't know Bach would wonder what the attraction is after listening to this."
5,"Rain, Rain, DON'T Go Away!","Momo is delighted with the umbrella and rain boots she receives for her third birthday. She eagerly awaits a rainy day as she knows that her umbrella and boots are not for sunny or windy days.The preschooler's impatience and eagerness to use her new ""grown up"" presents can be recognized and understood. With those gifts come Momo's independence and sense of self. Momo reminds herself to comport herself ""like a grown up lady"" and one can't help but smile at how Momo sees herself and her world, rain or shine.That umbrella was the start of Momo's independence; it is one thing she never forgot to bring home; she was able to walk unescorted and she saw herself as being closer to the ""grown up ladies"" she admires.This is an excellent book and a timeless classic that will shine on the memories of those who read and/or listen to it."
3,Good Basics - Not a 'Mastering' Security book,"If you are looking to compare this book with ""Mastering EJB"" by Ed Roman then you are making a big mistake! This books is very focussed on Quadrasis EASI implementation ( I never heard off).(+) Good high level book for concepts.(+) This book covers well all emerging Web services security specs including WS-Security, SAML, .NET Security etc.(-) Only address Proprietory technologies from Netegrity and Quadrasis (Quite upsetting).(-) Not enough examples to cover all the security specs.(-) No discussion on implementing Liberty and Passport technologies."
2,Quadrasis EASI Web services security - user guide !,"This book covers the basics and fundamentals of Web services security and industry specs to an extent and quite good.This book promotes Quadrasis EASI security kit (like a UserGuide) which made me so annoying! It does not provide practical examples from industry leading security vendors like Netegity TransactionMinder, SunONE Identity server etc.If you are looking for implementing XML Security using Netegrity TransactionMinder, Microsoft Passport, SunONE Identity server..then this book is a WRONG CHOICE. You may find this book more appropriate if you are a Quadrasis user."
3,bushman,"ok heres the thing: you cant beat bush no matter how hard you try. rossdale has a very distinct sound and lyrical composition. camparing bush with institue is comparing a rat with a bear. when i listen to this album i take it for what IT is not for what bush was. the songs have heart and seem well thought out. at times it becomes a little generic, but overall,its a decent album."
4,Where Have All of The Hooks Gone?,"On this CD, Institute - also known as Gavin Rossdale's new band - played rather monotonous hard rock. It wasn't particularly catchy; there are few grooves here that bring to mind ""Warm Machine"" or ""People That We Love"" from Bush, save for the gorgeous, intricate ""Ambulances,"" or the lighter side of the band showcased in ""Mountains"" or ""Save the Robots."" In fact, the only noisy song that worked here was ""Boom Box."" As for the other eight tracks, they meld together into a safe - but rarely intriguing - sound."
2,"Gavins voice is still good, BUT MUSIC BLAND WITH OUT NIGEL!!!!","I listen only to the samples but every single one & heard a few full lenght tracks, waiting for one song to catch my attention. I really loved the music he produced with bush the combination of his music writing coupled with NIGEL PULSFORD was an explosive combination, Kinda of how Tom Morello's Guitar Riffs/Noises/Solos made the Rage Aaginst the Machine stand out with ZACK DE LA ROCHA's voice! I will admit ""Moutains"" caught my attention,alil, but the problem was I was waiting for someone to fill in te background like Nigel did. Never happened! I MISS BUSH, Well more of the colaboration of the band/Music. THEY NEED A NIGEL, SOMONE ANYONE it needs those cools sounds back!"
1,Absolutely pathetic,"I was very excited when I heard Gavin Rossdale formed a new band I always felt he was the backbone of Bush, and thought he could carry another band, no problem. Hmmm... well, either he's not the frontman I thought he was, or he just put together a band with no chemistry whatsoever.This Album sounds like a bunch of buddies who got together to jam; wrote some choppy tunes, laid the foundation for a few tracks, then quickly scrambled to jumble together some lyrics (which are AWFUL, btw). It's just basically music with absolulely no harmony, no feel, and like I said before, horrible lyrics. Never before in my life have I seen such a profound frontman fall flat on his face as I did with this album. This album can't even boast a decent song. Every song is B-Side quality.Hey Gavin, how about trying to reconcile with the band members of Bush? Save your career, please."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I'll keep this review short. My biggest problem with this album is the quality of the lyrics. Most of it is stupid and just plain ridiculous.But then again I haven't listened to Bush always for their lyrics. Gavin's voice carries this record. The music is hard as was promised. Another EXCELLENT feature is the choruses in this album. They are infectious and energetic. My personal favorites are Mountains, Wasteland, Secrets and Lies, and Seventh Wave.I also don't see a market for this type of music in this age."
1,A huge waste of time.,"This album offers nothing new and exciting at all. Bush were a (still are? thats if they are still together, maybe)resepectable band.Everything about this album is a drudge and drag. The guitars are heavy, but with no edge or buzz, just a big fat lazy noise, and none of the songs really offer anything great, just loud guitar riffs with the odd interlude or unsurprising intro, all the while lacking any real identity or direction.Why Bush have disentergrated is a mystery, they were a great band and while their last two albums did not make such an impact as their first two, they still were excellent, not surprisingly they were totally ignored in favour of commercial nonsense instead - BORING!!!It will be interesting to see whether Gavin Rossdale will reform Bush to make another album..... in what another 7 or 6 years? More than likely."
1,bruality,"this is the worst book i actually investyed in some o fhtose way expensive stocks and i nearly lost over 100,00 thousand dollars this is a bad book it ruined my future as well as my families future thank youinvester, not known"
3,Depends on what you like,"Now this is really a strange book. As I'm German this was on the ""to read"" list in school. But to be true I enjoyed this story of a boy who finds himself transformed to an Insect. You certainly think that this book was written by a lunatic. But that is also where the fascination lies. I'd say read and see for yourselves!"
2,dish rmote control,"volume barely works, mute does not respond on every action . I expressed a replacement for a 5.0 IR but received a 3.1. That may be the problem."
3,Impressed me all throughout the CD,"I abslolutely love Five Iron Frenzy since their first cd ,Upbeats and Beatdowns, and they have always impressed me.. The only reason why I didn't give it more stars is because this one was only an EP and it had several good songs on it! The bassist I must say is also amazing and they have pulled it through all the way!"
3,Weird...,"This is probably the strangest album I own. The bonus tracks are hilarious and several songs are good, especially Dandelions and My Evil Plan to save the World. But other songs, like the cover of ELO's Sweet Talkin' Women are trash. Roper's voice is kinda cool, but weird. To sum it all up, this is FIF's ""Strangest Album Ever!"""
5,Great band and great CD,This band is so good and I am so sad that they broke up but when it is time it is time. But this CD has some great tracks on it and it is a must buy for any Five Iron Frenzy fans.
5,This is a fun C.D.!,"I had been looking for the song Dandelions for a really long time. I finally found it, but on the RealPlayer recording that I recently have, I can only listen to half of it. I love the song! It is such an AWESOME song! I've heard it twice on the Air1 radio network for RealPlayer, but only twice. I can't wait to hear more of the AWESOME FIF songs!"
3,6 songs?,"please put more on your cd. buy their first two cd's they are superior. although riot gear is great, dandylions is great, and so is all that is good, but joke songs. and all that stuff make it pretty worthless for the cash. buy their first album upbeat and beatdowns. much better."
2,Third Time is Not the Charm,"This one will collect dust. I was very disappointed that there were not more quality songs. The first three songs are good. Kudos to Jeff the girl for ""All That is Good"" The second verse of ""Dandelions"" is very touching, almost a prayer, it makes a connection. Other than that it could have been a maxi single. Oh yea, please lay off the poltical messages."
2,FIF,"After listening to the first few FIF albums you get a certain feel for what they are like, and this is nothing like that. Its really relaxed and they dont rock out as hard as they used to. I like track 7, but thats about it. Its too mellow to be FIF. I love FIF but I hate this cd."
5,YYYEEEEESSSSSS!!!!,"I can't get enough of the PANTS OPERA!!! My friends and I have loved it for a long time and I finally have the CD!!! "" When I Go Out"" is also really funny and I couldn't even handle it when I heard ""Kingdom Of the Dinosaurs!"" It is so random--absolutely fantastic. The rest of the CD is also fabulous--I love ska and it's so exciting to hear Christian ska bands. Definitely skankable! My friends and I love it!"
5,silly but pleasing,I expected deeper lyrics with more meaning like the first two albums but an excellent job none the less. Great skamania tour. Keep up the good work. Praise God!
5,This album beats all of the rest. It's awesome.,Five Iron Frenzy is at their best with this new compilation of ska songs that any skanker can appreciate. FIF is an awesome band.
5,"Man it is smoken,hot,and somthin good for you!!","Hey, if you want rock,worship,& somethin to make you feel good, this is it!!"
4,addictive (but better live),"The first time I ever heard five iron frenzy was when I moshed to them live in concert. Ever since I've been and addict,buy it,from 1 sk8er chick to all you other sk8ers out there, i promise you'll love it."
5,FIF IS THE BEST SKA BAND EVER! BUY THIS OR BE SORRY.,"FIF has to be the greatist ska band in the history of ska! I have listened to this album, but for some reason don't own a copy yet, which will change soon. If you like any kind of swing or ska or punk or anything, you will like five iron frenzy. I just saw them in concert for the first time on their pants across america tour and they rocked! Oh, and by the way, I got to meet Reese."
5,Touching & Hillarious rolled into one!,"This c.d. rocks! i first heard it at christian camp and now i am hooked! it has a good balance of hillarity (like those pants songs you've been hearing about) also touching ones (1 girl army, dandelions, . . . ) BUY IT! It's great. One song i don't get is GET YOUR RIOT GEAR. It sounds like a copbashing song, but it has great rhythem!"
2,Silicone has not proved superior,"Contrary to what Amazon says, this insert fits perfectly in the stock wiper assembly for the 2009 Acura TL. They are quiet, but their wipe is not as clean as brand new Honda inserts. Each wipe leaves a very faint haze that quickly evaporates. Overall ""good enough"" and if they maintain the same performance through next year, they will be a better value than the stock inserts. The jury is still out.Update: It is still the same rainy season, and the performance of these wipers has already started deteriorating. I am going back to stock Honda inserts."
4,Tanita makes accurate scales,"I wanted to get a very accurate yet relatively cheap scale. In all probability you may have glanced over some of those >$50 scales with all of their fancy bells and whistles. So many of the scales being sold these days come with a body fat analysis program. The problem with body fat analysis using ""bioimpedance"" is that no matter how well constructured or designed the scale is, the body fat readout is most likely not going to be even close to your body fat reality. Knowing this, I decided to gauge my health by poundage and inches lost. The tanita scale I purchased is extremely accurate, very simple and looks good on my bathroom floor. Sure you could pay many dollars more for the body fat option, but in my humble opinion, it really ain't worth it. I gave it four stars, 'cause I always leave room for improvement. I can't think of anything at the moment though."
2,Not Accurate,"I just received my Tanita HD 314-S scale yesterday and I was very unhappy to find that there is no consistency in the numbers. I would get on and off the scale 4 times, and each time it gave me a different number ranging from 3-4lbs. I even took a 5lb dumbell and placed it on the scale to see what it would weigh, and it varied from 5.4- 5.2 lbs.I would look elsewhere if you want something on the nose."
1,does not work,"This thing is not consistent at all. If I measure my weight 3 times consecutively, all the three measurements are different. They vary by 5 to 10 pounds."
3,good scale,"I used this scale for some time, even hauled it several times in my suitcase when I was traveling for work. Finally become inaccurate after sitting idle for a year. Still, I would buy it again."
1,inaccuracy and warranty,"This scale was purchased in October, 2005. Four readings: 147.8, 151.2, 151.4, 145.8 - when Tanita was contacted, we were told they probably would send the scale back to us at our cost."
5,can't cheat with this one.,"This is great. Even for the people who have a hard time seeing. It has a lite display, with large numbers. The only problem we had with it was that it read about 5 pounds higher than our 10 year old scale. Of course so did the one at the doctor's office. Great scale"
3,HD-314 Tanita,"I acquired this after being diagnosed with congestive heart failure and the Dr wanted me to weigh each morning after putting me on water pills.It operated just fine for about a year and then started giving ERROR message on the screen and I would have to ""mess"" with it ti get a good reading. Don't know why this happened, still using it, but am very disatisfied with the problem."
5,"Good, accurate, economical scale","I got a great deal on this scale and haven't been disappointed. We have it on the nice even floor in our bathroom, and I've gotten the same measurement every time I've tried the repeating measure test.One thing they don't advertise but I think is a great plus- you have to push a kick button on the side of the scale to turn it on before you can step on and weigh yourself. This feature is hard to find in modern scales, and presumably is so you can calibrate to something other than nothing on the scale. That's nice, but more importantly when my cats decide to take a nap on it it doesn't turn the scale on and kill the batteries every couple of weeks!"
3,I prefer Thorlos,"These socks are very cool and great in the summer. However, I prefer the padding of Thorlo socks over being cooler. But if you want cool feet which are still protected from shoe burn, these are great. I love the colors!"
5,Incredible results...,"I was in awe the entire time I was applying this product (several hours to complete the entire surface)...Paint that I thought was just completely done for, saturated with stains, marks, and scratches, suddenly began to shine like it was brand new!I still feel like it's too good to be true...but I've posted up a picture to show a comparison... :DAwesome product!"
4,Good bang for the buck!,"I picked it up at Wal-Mart because it was the only rubbing compound that listed oxidation as a cure all. I put some effort into some nice swirls on my trunk deck lid that is on a 94 Mercury. After two applications it did a pretty nice job for the price and the harshness of the oxidation. While it is not 100% better, I'd say it was a reduction of 50% or slightly more. Now on another area up front, where someone backed into me (parallel), It took the blantant scuff completly out. That amazed me. Give it a shot. Its a great little nifty compound."
5,Unbelievably Beautiful Performance!,"If you think you have heard Chopin before, listen to Mr. Nakamatsu play. His performance reminds one of Rubinstein but I daresay that Mr. Nakamatsu edges out in the lead.The touch, tone and interpretation are simply stunning. He brings new life to these old standards. Be prepared to listen as if hearing these Chopin standards as for the first time. Not to be missed. A truly amazing experience. I have been a classical music lover all of my life, and I am no youngster. No pianist on the modern stage comes close to Mr. Nakamatu's performance of Chopin. From the first few notes, I knew I was hearing something special. Buy it and enjoy!"
3,Ok...,"I thought the performance was real good, not too fast as many other pianists like to rush through this piece. I purchased this cd a couple of years ago, but, the sound quality is a bit disappointing. I guess I am spoiled but, I like clear recordings, somehow, this recording is a bit fuzzy...I am currently seeking a new recording(alternate pianist) that I can hear better so that I can enjoy this most spectacular piece of music..."
3,Two years later...,"Although informative and full of useful advice in the promotion section, in this fast-growing POD business, there is no way a book published in April 2000 can cover the latest technological developments in the field. And when it comes to lists of related services, many of these companies are no longer around, while others have acquired a good or bad reputation. An update of those is in order."
4,Excellent Resource for Intercultural Trainers,"""Beyond Experience"" is a book full of different activites to be used in an intercultural training session. One of its very useful features is a full outline of a training design, with timeframe included, which incorporates the activities mentioned in subsequent pages. Trainers with more experience can use this as a base, bringing in other relevant material.The training activities described tend to fall more on the ""culture-general"" instead of ""culture-specific"" side, and are mainly designed for U.S. participants who are planning on traveling or living abroad, or are in contact with other cultures in the United States. The activities are also mainly for those who have limited exposure to other ways of thinking and perceiving the world. Through examining U.S. proverbs and the values that are held by the participants, the aim of the activities is to challenge assumptions and pave the way for a more successful intercultural experience."
5,A Fabulous Selection,This album has everything. Even past the songs we know such as Sam and Dont Stop Believin'- Olivia comes out with passion and it shows in this selection of love songs. From Love you hold the key-The last time you loved and compassionate man. The album was the 1st that Olivia recorded in the US and I'd say she was off to a great start. This album is soothing and definately needed for those tracing her back to her country roots.Still to this day- I smile and think back everytime I hear the song A thousand conversations. It's a real feel good album
3,What's up with the packaging?,"First, I loved this album growing up, and I am glad to finally have the remastered import CD version. However, the packaging was a great disappointment not only for this CD, but all the Olivia Remastered CDs. Sure it comes with a booklet of lyrics and pictures from the original albums, but EVERY photo is so grainy that it looks absolutely amatueristic. This includes the front and back covers and the photos inside the booklet. I would have sworn they were booklet copies if I hadn't purchased them from Amazon directly."
3,A Sterling '70s Spectrum,"This is the end of her mid-'70s sterling spectrum.The title track is beautiful. It sounds as if John Farrar was writing a song about Olivia herself. Pristine, wholesome--looking at both the past and the future with hope and fondness.There's also the well-sculpted sensitive (""The Last Time You Loved""), the wispy, whimsical waltz (""Sam""), not to mention the corny and the stupid (""I'll Bet You a Kangaroo"").John Farrar does an honorable job of straddling the line, but I get some sense of ""filler material"" here."
1,What's with the price??,How can a Kindle book be more expensive than a paperback? At the time of this review the Kindle version was sold at $13.99 and the paperback was $10.88.
1,"Calling In ""The One""","What a joke. If I could give this a minus 5 stars, I would. This person played their games with the opposite sex for 20 years and now when that person is hitting middle age they decide they want to settle down. And now they write a book about it. Play your violin for the selfish author and buy something else."
2,disappointted,"Someone suggested the book to me. However, I am not interested in finding a partner and that is what it is about so I haven't started to read it"
1,"Should be titled, ""Calling in The One...then the Next One...""","Well. I bought the book. Joined the online 7-week course, for $350 mind you. Only to find out afterwards that this author and her Soulmate, Mark, are divorced. She's now moved on to her Next One. I felt hoodwinked so thought people considering spending money on this ought to know they probably won't be getting what they think they're getting. I certainly don't! Would really like all my money back."
4,Daily Practice To Attract Love,"This has been a very enjoyable process, reading through the daily affirmations in order to put yourself in a more positive place and open to receive love. I highly recommend this book for anyone in search of a meaningful connection, as the information is quite useful. We all become jaded after a few relationships that haven't thrived as long as we would hope and no matter where you are at, whether you are in a relationship that is a bit stagnant or if you are in search of the next relationship, the information is quite useful."
4,nice personal story,"it is a nice personal story of the author and her experiences and what sha has learned.There are some good points in the book that she addresses. I cant say that the book has helped me directly. I think there is much more to relationships than what is presented. I do recommend this book, as i think it is good read and may shed light inot some aspects of life."
5,If your ready to change.....,"This book came along in my life when I needed it most. I was committed at the time, to whatever it would take to move me to the next step in my life. It helped me to examine myself and learn about patterns that continually attract me to the wrong people. I know now about people that are toxic ties. It also gave me so much hope that, Yes there is someone especially for me, a nice guy! That is true, because I met him. I have purchased the book and given it to those people that I know that seem to be in a place in their lives where they need to see themselves better and grow. It turns out, that one of those people was not ready for the ""work"" that it would take to use the book as it was intended, but the others have found it wonderful and helpful. This book has helped with my life as a whole."
3,Disclaimer: She's Divorced,"I didn't see any other reviewer mention this, but it turns out that the author of this book is divorced:""And so after 10 years of fulfilling married life, and much consideration, we both decided that our relationship had completed.""(see http://evolvingwisdom.com/consciousuncoupling/enroll/)I have not read the book myself, but I was considering purchasing it and got a quasi-weird vibe from the reviews. I did some searching and found this information.The fact that she divorced the man who motivated her to write this book does NOT at all mean this is a bad book. Clearly the book has a lot of value given the numerous high ratings. I just wanted to make this information available to prospective buyers, since it did have an impact on my decision.Apologies for breaking the rules!"
1,Corny book,Would never recommend this to anyone. Silly ideas and not worth the money! Save your money and time. I will admit I couldn't get very far....too painful to read!
2,Hmmm,"I bought this book, and to be honest, i've had it for perhaps a year and i must not really want to meet anyone cause i can't be bothered to work that hard to meet someone. Congratulations to others that have had success after following through with the book. I read a bit of it.. It might work, so give it go. Sorry not such a good review. I just think you'll meet someone if you stay positive, and live 'your life' doing the things you love doing, the right person will cross your path all in good time!"
5,great book,This book's title sounds a bit cheesy but it's a really amazing book that takes you through whatever is blocking you to finding authentic love and relationship in your life. My friends and I are doing it in a group setting where each week we come together and share our experiences or answers w/ each other and it is very healing. I think it's really great for people who have been through a lot of trauma and loss because there can be a lot of defenses built up that prevent one from finding a fulfulling relationship. This book helps you work through those in a healing way.
5,Try Me I work,"Married for 33 yrs and divorced for 16. Where are the men I could be dating? After just 4 weeks reading, writing and dedication,""Calling in the one"" has helped me understand what keeps these relationships in other women's lives. It's a look at myself, what I truly want and an opening of my heart to giving and receiving love. Already, I am interacting with men instead of running."
5,Worth the read,"Where was this book 20 years ago when I was struggling to find myself? This book is so insightful and really a journey you take with yourself. I just finished but am going to read it again to take more of it in. This author focuses on establishing your relationship with yourself so that you are better able to give to others. She is compassionate and understanding. She uses her own life experiences to show her growth, never making you feel like she is the expert but better guiding and supporting you on this journey of self discovery. My outlook on life is vastly different after reading this book, I now want to be a better person, the kind that will attract like individuals. I'm excited and no longer hopeless, I feel empowered to face fears and love myself and others."
5,Thank You!,"Love is who we are -- and calling Love into our lives in passionate partnership is a powerful and inspiring process, as outlined so wisely by Katherine Woodward Thomas. This workbook supports us in giving and receiving love right where we are, no matter where we've been or want to go. It's a wonderful book for all Lovers of Life!"
5,Eye Opening,"I'm not done with the book yet. I just completed week 3. I've enjoyed it so far because it makes me think about where I've come from which colors what I'm doing in the present. I've learned a lot that I can apply to my future relationships and can help others with theirs. I learned about this book after listening to the webinar. The recording is still available at [...] There is a paid course but since I don't like to spend a lot of money and this book is inexpensive, I tried this book first."
5,Calling in the One,"This book is about letting go of the blame, taking full responsibility for the choices in your life, and learning to consciously make good choices for yourself.It is an incredibly helpful and informative book with much wisdom.The truth is that this process helps you to become an adult rather than a wounded child and improves all of your relationships in life."
2,Not what I expected,"After taking Katherine Woodward's & Clare Zambit's online 7- week telecourse entitled ""Femine Power"" I really expected some results. My friend and I sat there week after week taking copious notes and practicing all the meditations and such. I felt ripped off $300. for the seven week course. I am not saying that there was not some helpful information. It is just that it did not produce the results that were promised in their advertisements. Also, I had written an email to Katherine and Clare and never heard a peep back. It is almost impossible to have communication with the folks who offer telecourses. I listened to the 75 minute into to the 7-week Calling in ""the One' course and it was very similar to the Femine Power class that I attended. I have yet to see any results from doig this work. I would not subscribe to their classes again or pay a dime for the books. Heidi"
4,Great Program,"This book takes a rare approach to attracting good things into your life, including ""the one"" ... by working on yourself. I truly enjoyed the exercises and the Program. I have found myself buying this book as a gift for many of my good friends."
5,One of my favorites,"This book helped me personally in my search for my soulmate. I don't remember how I came across it but I am blessed that I did. I've learned a great deal about myself and relationships from this exquisite masterpiece. I love reading and rereading it. The practices are well crafted and can be easily integrated into a personal spiritual practice. Katherine's transparency is deeply healing. This book feels like a balm that returns a soul to its wholeness and integrity.Calling in ""The One"": 7 Weeks to Attract the Love of Your Life"
2,Androids?,"I bought the e-book and hope to read on my android system; It seems like it's not available for android downloading; you will need to have kindle to actually read it. Hope it'll be available in android soon so I can read it on android. For now, I'm borrowing friend's kindle to read it."
2,American Kestrels,"My parents purchased this for me on Christmas, as I am an aspiring falconer. i was looking forward to getting it so terribly, and I was so excited to see it arrive in the mail.It was a huge disappointment. Everything I read you could find online. www.themodernapprentice.com has good information--the same information that I read in Mullenix's book. The only new information that I read was about the diseases, which I expect is discussed in other high profile books like Falconry and Hawking in North America."
1,Highly repetitive and boring,"Although the thesis of this book may be original, in that market uncertainty is related to the end-to-end nature of networks like the Internet, the same idea is repeated in various forms over and over again, making this a painful and not very satisfying read.the same idea is repeated in various forms over and over again, making this a painful and not very satisfying read.the same idea is repeated in various forms over and over again, making this a painful and not very satisfying read.(this is how it feels to read the book)(this is how it feels to read the book)I'm done."
4,Mr. Flanagan meet Mr. Miller,"The title says it all..""Dance again with Ralph Flanagan"". This is perfect dance music, beautiful and dreamy to the ninth degree. But boy does it sound just like someone trying really hard to sound like Glenn Miller and his famous Orchestra. Now I'm not saying thats a bad thing, if your going to steal you might as well steal from the best! Flanagan even has Miller sidemen Al Klink and Ernie Caceres in the sax section. Lots of nice tunes such as ""Dream"" , ""Stardust"" and ""Smoke gets in your eyes"" to help you out in the dream dancing department. Don't pass this one up just becasue Ralph Flanagan isn't a household name, he had a great band with a great sound(thanks to Glenn Miller)and thats a terrific combination."
3,Graymantle,"I found Graymantle to be a traditional fantasy book, that starts off with a loveable character leading a simple life and turns into a hero that saves his country from a terrible plight. The author did an excellent job making the reader root for the hero and boo the villain. What sets this book apart from others that follow this staple, is the bleakness of the world that our hero lives in and how the author describes it in fastidious detail. The hero did not have an easy road to the top of the social ladder, and evil was not easily vanquished. It was this that kept me turning the pages in suspense wondering what would happen next."
5,Another outstanding Marley concert dvd!,"Excellent dvd; the sound and video quality is fantastic. My only (small) complaint would be that ""Black Cat"" and ""Beach in Hawaii"" were not a part of it (two of the best songs off Ziggy's ""Love is my Religion"" album). A must have for any true reggae fan; Ziggy knows how to bring it, and the band is incredible too."
1,Find another text if you can,"I am a graduate student, half-way through my program and this is not a good introduction to the subject of Psych Testing. The wording is vague, the text skips around so much that finding answers to even simple questions requires extensive hunting. It is unnecessarily difficult to understand. Our professor says it will be a good reference book down the road, but I intend to sell it the minute I've completed the course and then go on to find another book so that I can get a better handle on the subject"
2,Not intuitive or written for the earlier stats learner,"This book contains the information needed to learn about how Psychological Testing works, but it's not intuitive and the writing is confusing. I wish my instructor would chosen a better book."
1,so dry!,"This book was required for my Psychological Measurements and Assessment class, so I had no choice, but to read it. It is terribly dry, with huge long sections of complex reading, not to mention, the information is very out of date. We had a supplemental book that was so much more interesting because it included application examples of the psyc tests. Anastasi does not - she is strictly data. I will certainly hold on to this book, though, just in case I have a bout of insomnia!"
1,Worst text ever,"The print is small, the examples are few and not always very clear, and the writing is very dry and uninviting. It is not intuitively written, which makes self-instruction is much more difficult than it needs to be.Like another reviewer, I wish my instructor had chosen another book. I am a graduate psych major and not a math major. Without layman's explainations of the importance and reasoning of the tests and correlations, much of it is quickly forgotten due to lack of meaning or use to me."
5,Caught by surprise,"I heard a track from the CD titled Moment of Praise and I cannot get that song out of my head. The music is soothing, it's wonderful, it's praise filled. What a way to worship the Most High!!! I can't wait to hear new releases. Keep them coming saints and keep praising Him. Fabulous work. God bless you Sharon and Faith Chorale!Blessings!"
5,This is the greatest album of all time.,God has blessed Sharon with a great talent. I would be very greatful to hearmore from her and her group.
2,"Smells great, but the lotion is not as rich as other brands",I purchased this product for my sister for Christmas because the other company I purchased Lilac products from does not make that sent anymore. My sister said this product was not as rich and of good quality like the other brand.
1,The Worst Album Of All Time!,I'm a Dead fan. Believe me. This album is a waste of money. You REALLY had to be there.
1,Wilted Roses,"You know that time in a Dead show when you sit down to get high, relax, or check out the crowd? This album is nothing more than a recording of out takes from the best of ""space."" Unless you are continuously as high as Wavy Gravy himself, don't bother."
2,An instrumental,"This isn't exactly one of the greatest Dead albums ever, and to tell you the truth, I hated it. This album is mainly an instrumental piece. And granted, the Dead are great instrumentalists, I just believe that they are better off putting more lyrics into an album, rather than less."
4,Simply explained and easy to follow,"I really liked this book. As I am still learning VoIP field. This book explains in very simple terms clearlly. Compared to Marcus Goncalves's ""voice Over IP networks"", this book was more informative and easy to follow. This is a great book for students and also for novices!!!"
2,Not up-to-date information,"This book was published in 1998, and that should tell you plenty about what is covered in it. Doesn't cover much of the new protocols such as WRR, DSCP, MGCP, policing, NBAR etc. etc. Where on the other had it goes into great detail on vocoding and different packetized speech traffic models."
2,Disappointing,"In our opinion, this book is more useful as a reference tool than a practical guide. The authors obviously have a high opinion of themselves, and this shows through in their style of writing.Nevertheless, the book successfully documents the quantifiable aspects of the technology; rare in a VoIP book. Two chapters deal with voice coding issues in very great detail, and this alone makes the book a useful addition to a technical library."
2,very thin when applied,"Paint goes on very thin it is thick even after mixing but when actually painting it on its very thin and even after many coats,I gave up and went with a spray."
1,Not much glow,"I had a dark site and high hopes. I still have a dark site. I'm no painter and not terribly steady, so application was a challenge. I had trouble getting it to flow smoothly, then it seemed to take forever to dry so the second coat was not a quick turn. After finally getting the coating like I wanted and cleaning off the spots I didn't mean to cover, I didn't get any glow. I set it in direct sunlight for 2 hours, then took it into a completely dark, interior room. Yes, there was a glow, but only a slight glow. If I had to acquire this site quickly in a dim room, I doubt I'd have much luck. For daylight situations, I still think you'd be better with a pearl type fingernail polish. If you need low light, get Tirgicon (SP?), a laser or a look-thru dot site. Yes they cost more, but they actually work."
4,CHEAP ALTERNATIVE,"SO FAR I LIKE IT , THEY SHOUD SUPPLY U WITH APPLICATERS , IN STEAD OF TELLING U YOO USE A TOOTHPICK TO APPLY"
1,Don't waste your money,"When I received my kit, 4 of the 6 bottles had turned to jello and were totally useless. The kit was returned. If you want real glow in the dark sights, replace your front sites with ones that glow for 12 years about $30. Ameriglow is one brand that works great."
2,biased,"While interesting for anecdotal pieces on Camus himself, Mr. Mumma is, however, biased & blinded by his religious beliefs and misunderstands Camus (not to mention that one wonders if some of the memories themselves are not... biased...). Certainly not a major addition to the body of intellectual studies related to Camus..."
1,How can a reader believe this book.,"I was shocked to read the author's statement that Camus was raised by his mother and his aunt. This is totally inconsistent with even Camus' autobiological notes. Camus was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother. If the author was such a great friend of Camus, how could he be so mistaken on this point ? Since little else in the book can be verified, this misstatement raises serious concerns about the veracity of the entire book."
1,"very, very suspect","i am not quite an encyclopedia entry on Camus, but I am very VERY suspicious of this account by Howard Mumma. this man basically claims that Camus had most decidedly chosen to become a Christian just prior to his death. he also asserts that Camus committed suicide. as an interested reader, does this not strike you as odd? if this is one man's attempt to disgrace the reputation of Camus - a ""man and a thinker"" - for the sake of political gain...shame shame SHAME ON YOU! if not, well, i apologize for calling you a filthy liar."
2,"One more so called ""Greates Hits""...","The album could be good if it was not for the disappointing fact that on a so called ""Greates Hits"" album her greatest hit (Cambodia) does not appear in the original version.I've read it was for ""time constraints""??? So they did have time to put a ""reprise"" of the song but not the original? Is this a joke?On top of that, the cover does not mention this fact but in the rear side, whereas the front lists the song among the highlights of the album!It is obvious that it had to do either with some producer's rights or with sales policy. In the first case it is her management's duty to bring such things in order. In the latter it is utterly annoying and a lack of respect for fans and customers (I had bought the CD mainly because of this song and was correspondingly disappointed), which is why my rating of this release is: ""I don't like it!"""
5,Its worth every penny,"I bought this watch 20 days back and it's simply great. You will love this watch. I have all friends ask about the watch from the day one and its looks cool and elegant.Only problem is that the steel get scratched very soon, especially the metal clasp on the strap looks messy after lots of tiny scratches.Note: There is no skeleton case back that lets you see the watch's inner mechanics. This is wrong information on the product description.Apart from these things, this will be a great buy, I fully recommended this."
5,For $200 a great bargain,"This watch is very aesthetic, the band is incredibly comfortable (being made of rubber as opposed to metal, leather or cloth), durable and quite the conversation piece. Have received many compliments and much interest in it. Stopwatch function works just fine. Also, for its size, fact that it is automatic and has a stopwatch, is very lightweight. The crystal is also durable and extremely scratch resistant."
4,"simple, practical, and easy to read.","I was clueless about non-verbal communication, except for some that I had seen on tv or something that I had encountered. This book gave me additional info and knowledge pertaining to BL. Now I'm not so naive."
5,THE book on courtship,"Don Steele's book is an excellent, down to earth, practical and brutally honest description of body language in courtship and mating from a man who has been there - and learned from his mistakes. His insights will surprise you, but sofar his advice has never failed me. If you want the best...buy this book and Don Steele's HTDYW 1 + 2."
3,Nothing new here,This book is OK but just your average body language book.If you've read any other body language books you won't learn anything new.
4,good book,This is a very basic book but it does cover the items it promises. The material is what would be expected and I reccomend this book
3,The Charisma of Body Language,"R. Don Steele's, ""Body Language Secrets: A Guide During Courtship and Dating"" is a good introductory book for becoming better aware of the nonverbal language that goes on between men and women during potentially romantic settings. A key take away of the book is to look for ""clusters"" of behavior from the person you are attempting to engage. Is their body in an open and receptive position? Are they smiling? Exercising friendly touching? Pupils dilated?Steele outlines why all these factors are important in assessing one's interest without verbalization. If over 50 % of communication is nonverbal, it behooves us to align our thoughts with effective nonverbal communication. To do otherwise, leads to extreme miscommunication and failed attempts at connecting. To be as attractive as possible, it is essential to manage one's physical and kinetic expressions.I highly recommend this book on the road to self-mastery.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute"
3,Some interesting points but can really lead to misinterpretation,"I think this book is good in getting you to start noticing more about non-verbal clues and body language. However, there is a lot of room for interpretation and a lot of times, you think get the signals wrong and end up embarrassing yourself!"
5,THE book on bodylanguage,"After reading Steele's book, I was so impressed I returned to this site to write a review and happened to read a review by someone who was not so impressed. The major point of the book that they have completely overlooked is that, when studying body language, one must look for clusters of signals. Relying on one signal is fatal. The book addresses this in detail.After reading the book for the first time I commenced observing body language in others. It wasn't until I read it again that I started to really hone my skills. Wow!! Suddenly I can read minds.This is powerful stuff and is helping me in all walks of life - not just dating. I plan to re-read it again with a highlighter and really hone the skills taught, as I believe that what this book teaches gives one a powerful advantage in all walks of life."
1,Fair warning,"If you buy this book new from Amazon, you will probably end up on the author's email list where you will be subjected to his spam for years to come. My repeated requests to be removed have been in vain and have forever erased any worth that may have been found in the pages of this marginal work. If you still want a copy, buy it here used and save yourself from the spam at least. In fact, my spam-free copy is available for sale at a steep discount."
1,Mostly trivial and irrelevant content,"This book is one of the worst I've seen dealing with body language. All of the information contained within (which is mostly trivial and shallow) is presented in the first few pages, and then repeated over and over again throughout the rest of the book."
2,Pop Psychology From The Bargain Basement,"Body Language Secrets promises a lot. Dates with beautiful women. Exciting nights of ecstasy. Romance, Love, Everything! Actually, it delivers little steak and much sizzle. This is a poorly written independently published book that would have a hard time competing in any bookstore. It consists mostly of hackneyed, dated information that is of little use in the 90s dating scene. It is complete with many typos and a lot of misleading information. Pictures of essentially unattractive people in bare feet illustrate the book. I suggest you save or money or try to find a copy at a flea market or used book store. I doubt if many libraries would buy a copy. My opinion: pass!"
4,Body Language Secrets,"AFTER reading BLS, I become more sensitive to women non-verbal signals, which are very subtle. Now I know why some of my asking for date failed. I am not aware of the signals that they were not interested in the first place! You can hear Don at his radio shows at live365."
1,steele keeps it real,"this book squares with other books and publications i have read regarding body language as well professional experience. i work in the law enforcement field and have interviewed and interrogated folks for 15 years. one absolute is...body language. one maxim used in his book is,""You cannot not communicate"". that nails it.steele is dead on in this simple but yet straight on explanation of the most obvious yet suttle facet of human behavior.he is consistent in his other writings and on live 365 shows that he uses to support his readers. buy it,read it once a month and pay Attention. it only takes one time to get what he is saying."
1,A very brief rambling book.,"I bought this book expecting a good introduction to body language and nonverbal communication and was disappointed.My biggest complaint was its lack of detail. It is a very small book with big type. And the author wanders off topic discussing tips such as where to meet women, how to approach them, what to say in a conversation. I would say 1/4-1/3 of the book has nothing to do with ""body language"". On top of that the author is clearly not an expert when it comes to dating advice. He comes across as an out of touch recent divorcee trying to give advice on how to pick up women.On the topic of body language the author gives only brief descriptions with little context or useful suggestions. After reading this book I don't think I've gained any new insight into body language. In short this book can be summed up in just a couple pages of listing basic body language ( arms crossed, looks away, picks up drink - means I'm not interested go away. )Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Mediocre bood for novices,"I purchased this book based on reviews and recommendations posted here at Amazon. I have to admit I am disappointed.Good points: concrete pictures (though not well-done), and accompanying explanations of what the body language of those pictured conveys. Might be useful to some who need the very basics explained from level zero.Bad points: No organization, no methodology, no classification, articulation is poor. Scarce number of poorly done pictures. Lots of anecdotes more appropriate for an online forum of some sorts. Packed with ads from the author about his other work.Interestingly enough, some ads are for products and services that I would NOT want to buy after seeing this book. For example, on page 68: ""Body Language and Dress for Success Video"". Look at the way people in the poorly done pictures are dressed in these book. Would you want to dress like them? I am guessing no."
5,Every man must read this book for business or personal use,"I found ""Body Language Secrets"" a great book to NOW Know the women that are attracted to me. I don't have to wait until she hit's me on the head with a stone. (anymore)There are many books written on the subject but R. Don Steele's book is like a coach telling you the wining plays. With 75% of human communications being non-verbal, R. Don Steele, specifically explains in 140 information packed pages the different signs of interests or disinterest expressed through body lanuage.I highly recommend this book."
2,A waste of paper,My problem with this book is that it simply states what has been said a million times before. I became familiar with almost everything in the book a long time ago.You don't need a PhD in Psychology to know that a closed posture means rejection and an open posture means acceptance.Save you money unless you are really clueless about human behaviour.
2,"Some very good information, BUT not much","This book does have some very good information, unfortunately there is not much of it. There are some very useful explanations of body language in the first couple chapters that will make you much better at reading other peoples moods and desires. However after the first couple chapters the author gets off topic and his suggestions for dating, etc are not very useful when they do not explicitly relate to body language. Also this book is generally poorly written, and there are sales pitches for the authors other products at the end of each chapter. In general this book has the feel of an infomercial product.I give the book 2 stars for explaining a small amount of very useful subject matter but I feel like there must be a better books out there about body language. This book was less that 200 pages and the useful information could have been summed up in 25. Not worth $19"
5,Great book,"I never thought about all the cues that people, especially women, use with body language. This book is full of gestures that people use to tell you rather they're (un)interested, arrogant, etc. It's very easy to understand, and I was able to use the cues within minutes of reading it. I even learned to watch women's body language around me, and how to send the right signals. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!"
5,Where was this book when I was a teenager?,"I wish I had this book when I was young; thank God I have it now. I don't think anybody can disagree with Steele's observations, I have recognized some of these gestures myself. But Steele goes further than the simple observations I've made and points out quite a few things I never realized. Since reading the book I have wasted less time pursuing women who are not interested, and spent more time on those that are."
4,"Monkey See, Monkey Do","The only reason why I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it's a little dated, and the author really is not in tune with what the dating scene is like these days. But the art of body language pretty much transcends time. After you read this book, it really is amazing the subtle signals that people give off that will tell you what they are actually thinking. You can pretty much put info in this book to use after you have read it. For those single guys like me who want to know what a woman is REALLY thinking when you talk to them, then this book is a must read."
1,"Most of This Book NOT About Body Language, Save Your Mone","Much of this book is very similiar to Steele's How to Date Young Women series. There are better and lower priced body language books out there without Steele's dating observations of varying quality included as filler. If this book were strictly about body language it would only be about 50 pages in length. Like his other works, which are self-published as is this, editing and writing are crude. Steele has some dating and relationship observations that are continuously recycled in his writings. And remember, he's twice divorced."
2,"Not secrets. So general. Common sense, though","it may not be that common.Not that I am being demanding or exceptionally critical, however, the author himself did admit that people nowadays had become so sophisticated that he or she could manipulate his/her own body language that the real meaning behind many of the movements/gestures discussed in the book should be judged by the readers themselves. If that's the case, what's the value of this book then? The content of it is just too simple, if not sometimes naive. I am sorry that I had made a mistake for buying and reading this book.For those who want to study about body language, ""Never be lied to again by David J. Lieberman"" is a much better choice. For those who want to improve their knowledge on courtship and dating, ""How to make anyone fall in love with you by Leil Lowndes"" will satisfy you well."
5,"Simple, practical, magic!","This book will ""open your eyes"" to see the wealth of nonverbal information you've been throwing away all of your life when you meet others for the first time and every time after that. The tips for how to SEND nonverbal signals to the subject of interest are especially helpful!Some of the material is repeated from ""How to Date young women for men over 35"", by the same author, but the books are a perfect complement to each other.A great, quick, easy read. Detecting body language signals is fun to practice and EXTREMELY USEFUL to understand in dating, business, and, my favorite, POKER!"
5,The only book that precisely describes courtship BL,"There are many books out there on body language, but Body Language Secrets: A Guide During Courtship & Dating is the only one I know of that focuses on signs of interest. It actually describes and shows with photos what gestures women use to entice or dissuade men. Priceless!Most men are oblivious to the subtle messages women subconsciously send. By reading this book and only approaching women who show interest in you with their body language you'll be way ahead of the competition.Buy this book today and gain an unfair advantage."
1,Sorely disappointed,"The vast majority of this book is old school courting that simply will not work today. Women are more sophisticated in picking nonverbal than this book talks about. If your inner psychology is jacked up no amount of body language will fix that. In addition, if your body is not moving right then you cannot even get out of the gate to send the right signals and all of hers will be skewed."
4,A good start,"This book is a good start in courting body language but most of this information can be found in other books which are both better written and have more attractive people in the example pictures. The author's style of writing takes a while to get used to because it is both unrefined and brutally honest. This book did have a few topics in it I havn't found in other books and because of this, have purchased his other works as well. As usual, my advice to anyone purchasing dating books: read many books from different authors. Everyone has different results with different methods since you are different from everyone else and so is your target. What works on one person for someone may not work on another. The more tools you have in your toolchest the better."
3,Body Language Is Only One Piece!,While this book is certainly interesting as it covers and hightlights the value of understanding body language it misses other facets of relationship building and attraction. What about mindset? What about steering towards motivational factors? Where is information on potential roadblocks? I suggest you buy this book because within it there is some helpful information. For people who are interested in the real deal may I suggest you check out the best book I have ever read on relationships called STUMBLING NAKED IN THE DARK. It covers not only body language but other aspects that this book misses.
5,Excellent! Really enjoyed the book,"This book has made life so much easier for me its unreal! Don shows you how to tell when a woman is interested in you from across a room, this makes it much more likely that you will not get shot down when approach her to talk. Don also covers how to tell when a person is lying to you and gives details on how best to continue to courting women. At live365 Don has a radio show called the ""The truth in dating and mating"". I listen to this show to reinforce the principals learned in body language secrets."
3,Keep your saltshaker handy...,"There are some good observations in this book, and good advice on learning to read other people's unconscious body language, as well as how to control and adjust your own. But take the pseudo-scientific claims with several grains of salt. What the heck does it mean to say that ""people form 90% of their opinion of you in the first 90 seconds""? How would you measure a thing like that? How do they know it isn't 85% in the first 95 seconds? Should you CARE about the opinion of anyone who makes up their mind about you in less than 2 minutes? Also, the author often comes across as pompous and arrogant. The way to read this book is to consider it an intellectual exercise to get past the hooey and glean what's valid from it."
4,Could Be Helpful,"There is no doubt that people put out unconscious signals. However, it is debatable if everyone does them the same way. Just because a person crosses his arms doesnt mean he or she doesnt want to talk to you. Much of it has to do with culture, habits and immersion. However, if you use this book for generalizations, it could be very helpful to help you be more observant.I recently found an excellent source for questions that couples should ask each other during courtship. It is questionsforcouples dot com."
1,"The worst of the worst, author is off base!",This book is a waste of your time. It has no content of substance. Please do not buy!
5,Great !,"I'm a graduate school student in Korea. though I've read many books about electromagnetic, I think that this book is the best among those. and I think I need this book certainly for my improvement of study. thank you !"
3,Kind of flimsy,Definitely not as useful as I thought it would be. The mini USB cable is very flimsy. I doubt it would last long with much use. The 12 volt plug-in seems a little flimsy too. For some reason I thought there was a place to put a 9 volt battery inside so I would have back up power for my phone when waiting in the airport. But the 9 volt plugs into the outside of the unit making it ungainly. It works though I have already thrown it in the junk drawer as it is not very useful. If you bought it on Amazon for $19 you probably got your money's worth but if you bought it in the airport for $35 you got ripped off.
3,No end connector! Good fan.,"I did not realize that this fan had no connector when I purchased it. My saving grace was that I was able to use the wire connector from an old fan I was going to use for a case fan.A proper wire connector and it works just fine. I didn't know how to get the proper connector for the end. I'm not the most astute to know how to find these items, and usually the ends come factory installed. I was startled to receive it w/o any way to connnect it to the motherboard or to a power supply source. I didn't see that the photo shows bare wires at the end.The fan works fine; just realize if you purchase it that it has no end connector."
3,Sunstein and Judicial Politics,"Sunstein's look at America's political process does have some innovative ideas for how to fix some of the problems that he perceives. In this book, he furthers his idea of judicial minimalism, the idea of the least active court. This book is probably only for polished legal scholars."
2,cute toy but not durable,"My cat loved this toy but she destroyed it in about 5 minutes. It's really quite flimsy. Perhaps if your cat is very gentle and just wants to cuddle with it, this would be a good toy. My girl loves to go crazy with her toys so this didn't hold up at all. In fact, the little beads and bell fell out almost instantly and is really quite a choking hazard. I'm surprised that they advertise it as ""durable"" because it most certainly is not."
5,5 Stars!,"A wonderful book! It makes you laugh, cry, smile, and you'll want to read it over and over! The small town stories included in the book make you feel like you are from the same town and like you've known the authors your entire life. (A Mention of Patty Loveless is also never a bad thing in any book!) Wonderful book that I enjoy reading often."

5,A Great Read-Aloud!,"I am a homeschooling mom with 8 children (ages 2-16), and my kids love to have books read aloud to them. This one has become a favorite! It has it all: children (with good character) as the heroes, adventure, narrow-escapes, and a satisfying ending! My children are picky about which books we read (me too, but for different reasons!), this book pleased us all! Also, I should mention that Amazon is the only bookseller carrying the recent republication of this book (I think, at least I have not seen it elsewhere). It is a beautiful, quality hardcover edition. Used copies on auction sites are selling for more than Amazon's price (and this for a 1960's paperback edition). Worth having in your home library!"
5,An unforgetable book that you will treasure for years on end,"I was read this book when I was in the fourth grade by my teacher Mr. Alter. He read to us a chapter a day, in the mid-70's at Auburndale Elementary in South Florida, and I will never forget how intrigued and captured I was that I could not wait until the next day of school to hear what happened in the following chapter. Now, at 30 I am enjoying the book once more and I hope to share it with my own children some day. This book is a timeless treasure!"
1,Looking for a decent review,"Doesn't anyone know how to write a book review? Not one that I have read about the Lion's Paw gives a summary of the plot, the characters, the reader level. Lots of emoting and reminiscing do not constitute a review and do NOT help a person make a decision to buy!"
5,I was a South Floridian Fourth Grader too!,"Mrs. Baldwin read us the book at Palmetto Elementary School in 1969. I spent the last chapter sitting outside because I checked out my own copy and read it before she was finished. No matter, the story still had a tremendous impact on me. It sounds like I unexpectedly ran into some classmates as I was looking for a book to read to my children! I am now living in WA state. The boat-based adventures never left me either, and I can't wait to pass on the tradition to my family."
5,Great Book!,"Mrs. Painter read this book to my 5th grade class in Clearwater Florida's South Ward Elem. and it started me reading for a lifetime. I'm actually writing this review on Sanibel Island! I have been looking for this book for sometime to give my 4th grader. Great story, history, descriptions and lessons here."
5,A blast from my Past,"I read this book as a child. It went out-of-print years ago and was only available used at prices exceeding $100.00. Recently re-published by the author's widow, it's a must read for children and adults alike, and more than worth the new copy price of $20.00. A truly uplifting experience. Please share this book with those that you love."
5,A Classic,"The Lion's Paw was my most loved book of childhood. I was mesmerized by the tale of Nick and Penny and their escape from the orphanage. Together with Ben, a boy who refuses to believe he too, is an orphan, they set out to reach the Hardalee, Ben's father's ship. Ben wants to take the ship to prevent his uncle from selling it. In some way he hopes that by keeping the boat, his father will have a place to return to, even though his father has been reported lost in the war. The three manage to get the boat in open water and set off in search of the elusive Lion's Paw, a rare shell. Somehow, if they find the shell they can afford to escape and live on their own. Robb White draws from his years as a Naval officer in the Philippines during World War ll. Written in the 1950's this may have a few dated spots, but is a wonderful adventure."
5,My son's first book,"Favorite childhood story of mine, I wanted to let my unborn son hear my voice as I read to him the adventures of Penny, Nick, and Ben in the untamed beauty of my home state...."
5,Bible Stories with a Twist,"If you enjoy Bible stories, you'll love Kalas's wonderfully witty yet incisive style of presenting the often-overlooked ""twist"" on a familiar subject. This book was not only fun to read but made me stop and think twice about stories I thought I knew quite well."
3,Actually Pretty Dull,I thought I'd enjoy this a lot more than I did. Actually it was pretty dull to read: an effort rather than a joy.
4,Leonard gives us another cast of colorful characters...,"Leonard gives us another cast of colorful characters in a tumultous story that holds your attention. Despite the action focus, the leading characters are memorable, unlike the one-dimensional cast typical in the action genre."
3,Just OK,"I like Elmore Leonard, but this one is ultimately unsatisfying. Too many long scenes of two characters discussing things they did in the 60's. Too many scenes of characters discussing whether A1 or ketchup is better on a hamburger. The cop is an unlikeable loser living at home with his folks. No depth to his characterization. Too much depth on the hippies.Worst of all, an underwhelming ending. I was left with ""That's it??"" You've got all these sleaze bag characters in one room, and that's the best you could think of??Skip it unless desperate."
4,Thrilling adventure,"Wow! what a wonderful, suspense, action packed thriller. 60's left over hippies, who would blow up buildings, banks, come back alive in 80's to extract revenge and collect booty from two rich brothers, snobs, and one a hopeless drunk. But they did not count on a energetic selfless honest cop who is also an expert in assembling and disassembling bombs. The last scene, a masterpiece, will keep you on the edge of the seat and all one has to do is keep turning the pages. It ends with a bang and the charectors reverberate long after you finish the book. Elmore Leonard's tour de force. A book begging to be a movie."
4,freaky indeed,i like this book.i like it that much so ill recommend it to anyone who likes crime novels.the best character is probably robin.she and her partner cause havoc everywhere and its up to the hero chris to stop them.well enjoy!
3,Not as great as i thought,I expected sooooooooo much more from the author of Pronto and Riding da Rap...It was definetly trippy but not freaky
4,Cool.,"Elmore Leonard is here at his coolest and most intense. This one is just as hip and funny as the best of his work. You get a somber feeling when this book ends, lets go, and you have to put it down."
4,Three words,"Hard to Handle. Jerry must have gotten a hold of some good brownstone, cause he is out of control on this track."
4,Great mish-mosh of live recordings,"Live performances spanning the Dead's entire career, give or take a few years, collected lovingly by Phil Lesh. (Man, that ""Midnight Hour""! Throw that one into the time capsule [""what were the '60s like, mommy?!""].) We want more Fall Out, Phil! Pretty please with sugar on top!!"
4,"Somethin' Old, Somethin' New","This eclectic mix of Phil picks has some real gems. The extended Midnight Hour and Hard to Handle give the listener a good feel for Pigpen's strength as the lead vocalist. The Jack-A-Roe is the most unique cut, in my opinion, with a speedy, almost samba-like quality. The Mason's Children is great, and in the Visions of Johannah, Jerry sounds hauntingly sweet.The only drawback is the continuity--the songs are not in any order according to their age."
4,"CD is good, Too Hard To Handle Is Incredible","There are some nice selections on this disk (the first Jack A Roe performed by the Dead), but nothing that is a truly must have, other than the Too Hard To Handle. The track is from an audience mic of a 1971 performance and the sound quality is exceptional. I grew up going to Dead shows in the 80's and was accustomed to the crowd interaction when the crowd had a well versed familiarity with the Dead's material. Here there is this raw excitement you can hear from the crowd's reaction. The way that they respond to Jerry's solo is just like an old fashioned revival - the energy just keeps escalating in the crowd response and Jerry in turn just keeps ratcheting up his playing until the house sounds like it going to come down. Amazing!"
2,a very personal trainer,a swarthy fitness guru who sexercises with rich suburbanites is poisoned. a weak link in an otherwise praiseworthy rachel gold series. a straightforward who-done-it lacking the usual consideration of weightier legal issues.
3,"Ms. Gold, An Average Lawyer Solves An Average Mystery","On second thought, she really didn't solve the mystery. Our Rachel did find out why someone was murdered, but didn't really find out who done it. In the less than clever denouement the killer more or less walks up to Ms. Gold and admits the crime. The author can't think of a way for our sleuth to solve the mystery? You sort of get the feeling that Michael Kahn put the names of all the characters on a dart board and chose the one hit by his flying dart to be the big baddie. I don't know if I care for this random selection technique. Kahn's Rachel Gold books have gotten good reviews, so maybe this just isn't one of his better ones. The main characters are fairly interesting, and the male author seems to do a good job of being able to write about a female protagonist, but all in all this book is not very fast paced."
5,The best one,"This bookk was amazing. Theres two weddings going on at the same time. Claud, Mary-anne, and Kristy go to Dawns house during Christmas break for Dawns dad's second wedding! While the rest are at Mrs. Barrets wedding! Jessi does somthing hilarious that you'll never believe it is honestly a great book. To prove it i read it 18 times!"
4,Okay.....,"I liked this book overall. I would just like to say that:1) I don't like crybaby Mary Anne who tries to rule (and ruin) Dawn's life. Have you read ""Farewell, Dawn?""2) I wish Mr. Dewitt and Mrs. Barrett's wedding were on a different date than Dawn's father's, so the BSC could be together at both.Otherwise, the book is ok and does have it's funny parts, but it was not my favourite."
1,OMG! This water is gross!,"I wanted to try an alternative to Hint that was a little cheaper. I tried this water and it had a weird taste. It is hard for me to describe, but I shall try. It taste...""chemically."" In the description, it stated it had minerals in them and it tasted like they put too much...minerals or something. It was very hard for me to finish and I'm angry that I spent the money. I'm going back to drinking Hint."
3,A step away from soda,"This is a product that is perfect for someone who cannot EVER drink water because they are addicted to sugary beverages like Gatorade or juice or sodas or whatever. I say this because O Water is REALLY NOT like water at all - there is a distinctly chemical / flavor taste to it. It really does remind me of Gatorade minus the sugar. For someone who is easing themselves away from such unhealthy habits, this beverage is probably a good idea. However, I was looking for something light and natural, kind of like flavored waters from the spa -- with just a hint/aftertaste of fruit. This is NOT it. If you're looking for a subtly flavored water, try Hint water instead. However, if you're trying to get your kids off artificial beverages, this is a good compromise as it is juice-like without any actual juice content or sugar. Personally I thought it tasted gross."
5,Better than roll-ups,"More conveniently packaged and better for the kids, too. I donate these to daycare to dilute the amount of gummi things the kids are exposed to (from other parents!) At least these are somewhat good for them, and they love them besides. These come in lots of flavors, too, for those picky eaters."
5,A New Beginning,"Anne Rice has done it again. Being 16 yrs. old, I have not had much experiece with this exsquisit writer but I saw Interveiw with a Vampire and when I finished reading Vittorio, I couldn't wait to read her other novels. I treasure Vittorio and I can't wait to read the other novels that are already out. This book was deeply involved and a pleasure to read."
2,Stick with interview with the vampire,"I had read the first in the new series Pandora and found it more interesting and bareable. I found that this book dragged at parts as you hear the young, still human Vittorio talk of revenge. He doesn't even become a vampire till almost the very end whereas in Interview the Vampire the tale begins with how he was created. The whole moral of the book is summed up in the last few chapters: revenge will eat away at you, people do crazy things for love, and whatever evil you do will come back to haunt you and stay on your conscience forever. To suffer through most of the novel to find out the obvious in the end just made it seem like a waste of time. If you really like Anne Rice's work read it for the hell of it but let me say this, I warned you it was bad."
2,Couldn't even finish it.,"This is one of the worst and most disappointing books that i have ever read. After reading both Interview and Lestat, i decided to pick this one up, expecting something spectacular. Instead of the uplifting, romantic, adventurous tale that i had wanted, i got (in my opinion) a shabby, sputtering plot and writing that didn't seem to focus on or develop the characters. I don't know if having angels involved is normal for Anne Rice books, but i thought that including them was somewhat insipid. Another thing that bothered me was that i couldn't figure out exactly what Vittorio was, even reading more than 1/2 of the book. For me, it wasn't Vittorio, the Vampire; it was Vittorio, the Crazy Italian who Sees Angels. And that wasn't something i wanted to read."
2,Disappointing,"Unlike most of Anne Rice's books, this book was very slow. The entire book is about how Vittorio became a vampireand almost nothing of his life as one. It was extremely slow moving and the love story was not believable. I found myself skipping many paragraphs to see if anything interesting was every going to happen. It did, but very occasionally. I would recommend saving your money and just rereading some of her better books!"
3,Perhaps she is running out of ideas...?,"Vittorio was definitely not of the same calibur as the earlier Vampire Chronicles. He wasn't as vivid and alive. The story was ok... not great, but ok. It is a little more fanciful than the others. More out there in the wide world of dark fantasy. Vittorio's tale isn't quite as believable as the others were. If you haven't read any of the other chronicles yet, this one would probably be a good read, but when put up against The Vampire Lestat, Interview With a Vampire etc. it just doesn't hold up."
1,a little bit disappointing,"Before I had started this book, I had read the vampire chronicles. These were excellent and well written. This book is everything but exciting. To much bla bla about art, flat characters and hardly a storyline that kept me interested. Sorry A.Rice..."
1,Who is the author?,"This book is hugely infuriating. I finally finished it on the 3rd try. I keep asking myself is this the same Anne Rice who wrote ""Interview"" and ""The Witching Hour?"" I think she has become so successful--making so much money for her publishers--that they're afraid to edit her anymore. Lately she has become so self-indulgent as to be virtually unreadable. I struggled with ""Armand"" and simply could not read ""Violin"" even after 4 tries. ""Vittorio"" is hardly better. It is so maddeningly amateurish that it probably couldn't be published if it had been written by a first-time author. I told myself that it wasn't really Rice's voice that I found so annoying, but was the persona she'd adopted for writing as Vittorio. But then I remembered that I'd had the same problems with ""Violin"" and ""Armand"" and have to conclude that Anne Rice is simply getting lazy. And that saddens me because I used to like her work so much."
1,Will the Real Anne Rice Please Stand Up?,"Although a fan of Anne Rice's early Vampire Chronicles (first 3 were the best - 4 & 5 were ok), I am thoroughly convinced that Vittorio was written by Mrs. Rice's housecat. The language is far to simple, the plot far too stereotypical and boring, and the book does not measure into the same league as earlier works. ..."
1,"another boring book about the church, heaven and hell","every time i read the latest anne rice book, i keep hoping to have in my hands another interview, or mummy, or witching hour. but i'm always disappointed. especially when the book degrades into another attempt by the author to convince us of the existence of heaven and hell, devils and angels. and the ever prevalent catholic church.when will she learn that having her characters debate with angels or devils isn't a brilliant plot twist or a deep view into their souls which makes us look into our own. but instead is a boring discourse better left unwritten.the sensuality is gone from her books and has been replaced with the catholic church. don't even bother reading it."
1,It Bites. Literally.,"Dear Authors: if you have a number of interesting but not necessarily related ideas, take the time to flesh each one out individually in a well-plotted and well-written book. If you decide to cram them all into one short work you'll end up wih a pointless little casserole like Vittorio, the Vampire. The book starts well enough but then disintegrates; while the places are, for the most part, beautifully described, the characters are poorly drawn, the plot meanders aimlessly from pillar to post until it disappears altogether, and the various jumbled themes can't be addressed satisfactorily in a book this brief and hastily assembled. No wonder it was only $3.98."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Very average. I think I have mostly forgotten what happens, so that is about the definition of average, I think. A minor tale about a minor character at the minor end of a major series. Not too likely to be of any particular note, in that case, in general. It is certainly not the case, here."
4,Enjoyable,"While this book isn't the best of the Chronicles, it's a nice, light read. There's not quite as much angst here - you could say it's a 'lite' Vampire Chronicle novel. Some readers might be dissatisfied by it, but I honestly enjoyed it. I do wish that there would have been more insight into the vampire world, much like Queen of the Damned or Blood and Gold. Still, it's a decent read, with a rather nice vampire."
3,Vittorio's Review,"I like that Vittorio isn't associated with the other vampires. It was nice to read the experiences of another vampire in his own corner of the world, where he is unaffected by the rest. However, while the premise is good, the tale itself is good, and start, middle, and finish are infinitely readable, I was not convinced of the love story. Someone else mentioned this in another review, and they hit it on the nose. There seems to be no chemistry there. Ursula just strikes me as a word that rhymes with ""witch"". I didn't like her character even a little bit, and cannot be convinced that she really loves this guy. Without that in place, then much is missing from the book."
3,Not one of her best books.,I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Anne Rice's past vampire books. This one just had no real thread to connect it. His love for a female vampire is just not believable. The angels he saw on the other hand were probably the best part of this book.
4,It was wonderfully written,"It was lovley. I found Vittorio to keep me wanting more and more. The content was in full detail, and had incredible sequnce. The ending was a bit blunt though. How ever her introduction to angels was wonderful. Her forshadowing was subtle but gleaming. If you enjoy Anne Rice, this is absolutley one you can't miss!!!"
1,Seems like a basis for a new cottage industry,"This book read like a work-in-progress. As if a deadline had to be made and ""something"" had to be delivered. So little happens here that it seems Rice is setting us up for a series of Vittorio books. Contrary to what other people have thought the parts about Fra Filippo were the most interesting. And of course they were true as Rice tries to impress us with her bibliography. But at least she didn't resort to the soft-porn of Cry of Heaven."
1,Vampired Out?,"This is yet another typical Anne Rice ""vampire"" novel. There are chapters that seem to go on forever, bogged down in historical background. Anne Rice never gives the reader the chance to get a feel for the main character. If you enjoyed the other books in the vampire chronicles, don't read this book."
3,"Better than Rice's last 4 or so novels, but still...","Anne Rice definitely deserves points for trying something a little different, but the effects are uncertain. Chapters drag on with needless historical detail. Oh yes, and the central character? What exactly is he like? Rice fails to make him vivid, quite simply. His obsession with Ursula I didn't buy for an instant. The whole business with the angels seemed extremely imporbable to me as well."
2,"A nice prologue, but where is the novel itself?","After finishing Vittorio, I was disappointed, to say the least. The book is flat, no real characterization takes place. Some very interesting characters are introduced only to be beheaded fifty pages later. I would have liked to read more about Florian, Godric and the Court instead of the angels and Fra Filippo."
2,I'll give it a C-,I have all of Anne Rice's books. I try not to compare the new books to the old ones but I was very dissapointed with Vittario. The story started off good but quickly became dull and lifeless. There is too much missing in this book! What has Vittario been doing for the last five hundred years? Where was he when Akasha was destroying all of her kind? There is a small link to him and the other vampires that is missing. And the ending was so dull it made me feel I had wasted my time on the first 200 pages. I hope that on the next book she remains to be as detailed as she is known to be. To Anne: I still love you but come on I know you can do so much better.
4,worth the wait till the last 1/3rd,"This book was very different from her other vampire books. I found the first part of the book unenjoyable to read, and i didn't perticularly like the character, though the descriptions were interesting. But the last 1/3rd was extremely interesting to read, and as enjoyable as anything else she's written. when i finished the book i realized it was more of an old fairly tail or myth than a novel. it dealt with things in a more direct and simple fation, and the good and evil contrast were much more obviouse, very black and white, but it worked. If you look at it as a myth rathen then a novel, it is very effective, and a great read. Don't except the sort of engrosing novel you found in lestat or armand. Also, seeing the world through someone who truly believed in angels and deamons, as written in the city of god, was very interesting."
2,What a disappointment,"When I first opened ""Vittorio,"" I was so excited. I thought I finally had the old Anne Rice back. Her discriptive power, which has been lagging ever since ""Interview"" seemed back in full. But as I read on, a dull sense of unease began to creep over me.I was sure I'd read something like this before.I have - in the phone book, which, like ""Vittorio,"" shares a complete lack of characterization. Vittorio the character started off with such promise, but I didn't care about him by the end of the book. He was never developed to the point that I could. Ursala suffers even more; she could have been a cardboard cutout for all the time Rice takes to give her a personality. This makes the ""love affair"" between the two completely unbelievable.I take my earlier contention back. It's the characters, not the descriptions that make (or made) Anne Rices books good. Unfortunatly, it's not in ""Vittorio."""
3,"""Fair to Middlin""","I have enjoyed reading Anne Rice - until perhaps 4 books ago when she started her new series of vampire books. The last four, including this one, lacks a lot of the luster that her previous writing had. Vittorio was an engaging book, and the ending was very nice -- a love story I'd say but it lacked something. I also don't like the physical format of the book i.e., much smaller in size. You do get the impression you are reading a regular book, but it's simply an impression. Perhaps if the book had been longer she may have had more of an opportunity to bring it to life. In any respect I do look forward to her next book."
2,Vittorio the Vampire,"Anne Rice will always be a master of fiction, but VITTORIO is another nail in her casket as far as I am concerned. The short three hundred pages of this book were not enough. They were well written, but they were very much lacking. The joy of Anne's books includes learning the stories of more than the main character. In the golden days, Anne would have told us the story of Ursula at least. Come to think of it, Anne left out the last five hundred years of Vittorio's life too. Don't tell me he and Ursula haven't done something interesting in five hundred years. In summary, I'm very dissapointed with this book. Sorry Anne."
2,Vittorio Nice to meet you NOW go away,"After reading Vittorio I checked to make sure it was truely a Anne Rice novel. I enjoyed the images that were painted about Italy but I never want to read about Vittorio again. It should have been called ""The boy who weeps at EVERYTHING and happens to become a vampire"" Give me characters that I can have feeling for, either good or bad. I have hated and loved her other main characters so much that I feel that I know them, I don't want to know Vittorio. Shake his hand and send him away."
3,Hey I liked it but it was no Lestat,"Well I bought it yesterday and I have been reading it, it started off good but it started to get slow. I have not finished it all the way yet I have 40 more pages, but It is good. The thing I am curious about is in the book ""Pandora"" she said Lestat was frozen in a church. Please return him somehow he is the ultimate vampire. He is the one that she could truly write about. Have him return or something even if it is 1 book he needs to shine his heart down upon us 1 more time"
1,A bore with a good author's name.,"I got this thinking it would be good.After all, it's by Anne Rice. Instead of the steamy settings and cool vampires that have you drooling for more it was a story filled mostly with a whining vampire.Didn't we already get that with""Interview with the Vampire""? And that book had great characters to balance out Louis's whining. The same,sadly,can't be said for this.We miss the action we had with Lestat. Anne,get with it! I never thought I'd be saying this about a Anne Rice novel,but it stunk. Save you money for something else,because if you buy this you'll regret it big time!!!"
3,Ok,I love all of the vampire chronicles. This is a decent book in its own right but not what I expected from Anne. If you like her previous novels you should pick this one up. But unless you are a true fan wait till it is out on papper back.
3,i was disappointed,"it was great in the beginning and i loved Vittorio, but then i was really disappointed in how the story turned out to be.. it ended real quickly and Vittorio's character was so weak and yuckie at the end.. and all through the novel i just wished he would kill Ursula..!!she deserved it.. and i was never really convinced of their love story"
3,Vittorio the Vampire,"Being a Phd. I found the writing exceptional for the research and background work done by the author.The Historisticy was very accurare and brought to life the characters and period.Lots of fun to read, and very readable for the casual as well as ardent reader...rjr"
4,Off the beaten path,"Once again Anne Rice takes her readers off the beaten path by introducing us to her newest character, Vittorio. She breathes life into this character like no other. This adds yet another twist in the path of her branching storylines. Just as she managed to tie the Mayfair Witches to the Vampire series, she takes off in a new direction with the innocent Vittorio. The charm of Italy and the vivid descriptions add to the beauty of this tale. I look forward to reading more in this series."
4,Wonderul!,"I loved this new Anne Rice book. Vittorio had such a wonderful character. Again, her main vampire character(Vittorio) has a very strong love towards another of his kind. For a change, this time Vittorio is still with his companion(Ursula).Although, as wonderful as her book was, it was sort of missing something. She should of told about Vittorio's life centuries after he was,""given the dark gift"", but the book was still great."
4,Un grande viaggio...,This is the Annie we do love! Keep up the good work. We are waiting for the complete story of Marius and the sequel (book four) of the Mayfair witches... Ciao G.Luca - Roma.
2,Auch!,Usually Anne Rice writes pretty decent books but this must be her worst. The book raves as she tries to describe hallucinations. This makes it tough to follow. The ending is also a complete reversal the direction which the book took. And the logic and justification for that reversal lacks merit.
4,Not bad,"This was the first Anne Rice novel I've ever read. So, I had no expectations. I didn't mind the novel. I found it quick to read, and the story was entertaining. Plus, I loved the history part the most. That time period is fascinating, but the genre isn't necessarily one of my favorites."
3,What happened to Lestat and Armand?,"This book was good but I am still interested in Lestat, Armand, and the others.In my opinion Anne Rice should continue to write about Lestat. I will always like Anne's writings and can't give a bad review on her books."
1,Why?,I don't understand why Anne Rice even bothered with this book. Who wants to read about some whining spoiled baby who doesn't compare to any of the characters in her other great novels. Vittorio is a character that is a waste of time and energy. You might as well skip the book because it has nothing to do with any of the other Vampire books. He knows none of the other cool characters and contributes nothing to the saga.
3,A decent read,"Though not as exciting or character driven as her other Vampires, Vittorio was still a fun read. It is short and does not lack for action or beautiful writing. I have only read it once, a long while ago, but plan to re-read it as I have done to numerous Anne Rice novels. I would recommend this to any fan. It can even be read as a stand alone even if you have never picked up a Vampire Chronicle."
3,Alright I guess,"this book was alright. i was not as drawn into it as i was the others. most definately the high point for me was when the angels argued with one another, and then with Vittorio himself. Also, i enjoyed the fact that Vittorio is a completely different breed than lestat and marius and armand. David Talbot was right to tell Pandora in the cafe that with each new generation of them, there are those with such unique abilities that are soley their's."
3,Vittorio the Vampire,"This book is probably the slowest book I have ever read. It probably could have been 1/3 of its lenght and still could have gotten the point across. There is something to say about the charectorazation, though. Vittorio and Ursula are great charectors. This book proves that love can come from complete opposites. Also, this book is written extremely well. Everything in this book is written is crystel clear, although it takes 10 pages to describe one object. Thats what drove me crazy. This book took way too long to read. It wasn't, I feel, worth the time. If this book wasn't as long as it was it would be a great book."
2,Pretty Good,This is not a great book book it is Ok. Although nothing really happens and there is no unexpected turns or anything really exciting.Ann Rice is a good writer but she has obviously run out of ideas.
3,"Another fascinating, finely woven tale from Anne Rice","Anne Rice has written another tale of torment, betrayal, beauty and emotional conflict in Vittorio. Instead of focusing on the life and adventures of Vittorio as a vampire, Rice this time weaves the tale of Vittorio's ""death."" Set again in Italy, the countryside images Rice paints for us are almost as beautiful as the emotional struggle Vittorio wages and the paintings he so loves. Though I was a little disappointed that no familiar vampires were brought into this saga and he never ventures out of his beloved homeland, Vittorio's story is moving and satisfies the following Rice has acquired who cannot get enough of her true fictions."
3,far from the perfection,"I applaued Rice's colorful description, furthermore her undaying passion whitch showes it self in her work. Rice's world is filled with dark beauty. yet her new book is too short and really lakes debth. It seems written only to demonstrate her love for that particilar age, as if she wrote it upon a visit to florance just to immortalize an imortal city. but non the less I may seem harsh yet the level of perfection maintained by Rice has demolished in this book"
3,"First 2/3 good, ending lost me","I loved the book up until the end. The ending was kind of a letdown for me, it felt too much like a cop-out than a real resolution. While Vittorio and Ursula were interesting, I felt the book needed to be placed somewhere in the context of the Chronicles. It just seems like a standalone volume more than...well, part of a series."
1,Worst in a series of declining tales.,"I've read all her books. The Mayfair Witches, all the vampire series'. All of them. Nothing was better than an Anne Rice book on a long plane trip. I couldn't wait for the newest Rice book to hit the stores. With Vittorio, things took a dramatic turn. I almost couldn't finish it. I put it down so many times (out of sheer BOREDOM!) only to pick it back up in the hope it would improve. It didn't. Skip this one."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I am a great fan of Anne Rice, but this book was very disappointing. The characters were bland and I could simply not get into the book. I hope the next round of tales will be more exciting and a worthwhile read. If you are a new Rice fan, I recommend ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""The Vampire Lestat."""
2,Missionary Rice,"Whatever happened to Anne Rice? Is she suffering from religious delusions? Still being a fan of her first 3 vampire novels but increasingly disappointed by her last books I had some hope left for her newest offering. The Ricean catholicism (as featured in Bodythief, Memnoch and Armand) it seems, won't go away and is here to stay. Religious images lurk everywhere and smothered the story for me completely. Humor, usually not abundant in Rice's novels but at least glimpsed when Lestat was around, is missing entirely. The description of early Renaissance Florence is nicely done but nowhere near as vivid as New Orleans or Venice. I'm afraid I'll still read her next vampire book but more out of habit than anything else. A bit more irony and less religious zeal would help to change that ..."
2,Anne finally flubbed,"after faithfully reading the ""Vampire Chronicles"" from the start Anne has produced more of the same old.... in this book. I, for one, am not interested in the history of Italy during the Dark Ages. When reading fiction the author should not try to impress with his/her knowledge of a given subject. I felt like Anne was simply filling space to qualify Vittorio as more than the short story it should have been."
3,"Not great, but passes the time","Vittorio isn't terribly original. I found the whole *angel* development sort of trite and contrived... But it did help pass the time when I was stuck in a national airport waiting for my delayed plane, so I guess that's a plus for it."
2,Ughhhh,"I loved every Anne Rice Vampire book, except for this one. A word to the wise, save your 26.95 dollars on this book, if you're interested buy the cheap paperback cover. This book is soooo vague, I couldn't believe it! I was so disappointed. Vittorio didn't even change into a vampire until like the last 50 pages! This novel reaked! I think Anne Rice should've took a little more time on this novel. maybe she shouldn't write anymore Vampire novels."
3,Renaissance Vampire,"Looking for a dependably readable book for a long air flight, I picked up this continuation of Anne Rice's successful series. While Vittorio's story is much like many other of her vampires, it almost seemed as if written by an assistant, not unlike the Renaissance artists of the Florence era art world where her novel is set. Full of the sames scenes- a religious, repentant vampire, and his nobleman young life cut short, ""Vittorio"" is not original, yet with the addition of angels, it takes on a Tony Kushner flair. I liked the Italian setting, and it was too short, but if you like anne Rice's usual ornate, florid style, and occasionally sexy interactions, this one is fine, but no classic."
2,What happened?,"Strange story that was mildly interesting in the beginning and turns into a completely different one. I found myself scratching my head at the end, immensely confused."
3,New vampire,"This book is not the best of her vampire chronicles by any means to me. It is entertaining, but lacks the depth of her other vampire chronicles."
2,so-so follow up to spellbinding pandora,"Pandora was great. wonderful atmosphere, deepe writing. This book doesn't really do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but is really crushed by my expectations."
2,A disappointment.,"About once every two or three hundred years, a man lives who is so charming and beautiful and prone to uncontrollable weeping that he is destined to become an Anne Rice vampire. And so we meet Vittorio. This new vampire comes off as arrogant, pretentious, childish and unlikable, as does the book that bears his name. I am a big fan of Interview with the Vampire, but Anne Rice's books seem to slip gradually farther from the depth and drama of that first work. She didn't always need angels and demons to walk her through explorations of good and evil. I hope her next installment is a little fresher. I would love to love her again."
4,"The second in the new series is good, but slightly lacking..","Vittorio was like going down a new road for me. It turned away from the traditional characters that Rice has been playing with for years (Lestat, Louie, Marius, etc...) and makes up some new ones. Unfortunately, while the plotline was superb and creative, the book needed more depth. If it had been 200 pages longer it would have made the story so much fuller. As it stood, I was very upset that when i finished, I felt as though i were missing something. I felt like i'd skipped some pages while i read. But on the whole, what i did read was great, Vittorio is a grand character; it only needed more depth to be more rich. All the same, I recommend this book, as it is quite good."
4,I was surprised with this new route,"Anne is trying to break out of the ""Lestat and friends"" mold I think. This is the story of Vittorio and is initially set in the middle ages. This story is more mystical then many of Anne other books, at least in a very different way. Vittorio can see angels. They are unwilling companions in his quest to free his love from other vampires while still killing the rest of the vampires who are praying on a village. This book has several deep moral subthemes such as what sacrifices must be made for the greater good and choosing the lesser of two evils. Also the idea of powerful, but nearly inept divine agents. The angels were powerful, but hardly flawless.There is absolutely NO guest appearances from the vampires that we know so well. This story uses the same ""setting"" as the rest of the vampire novels, but all of the characters are new.Overall, I enjoyed the novel, but I admit I missed Lestat."
5,Anne Rice Does It Again,"Vittorio is a different look at her thoughts on Vampires. Vittorio brings to life the Vampires, the Saints and the times he lived in. One can see all the creatures in vivid detail. I had the audio unabrigd and didnt want to stop."
4,A Lesson In Choice,"Vampire tales are often designed to scare, tantalize and excite us. Ann Rice accomplishes those basics in 'Vittorio the Vampire'. She take us one step further with a lesson in choice.Rice first establishes a fantastic setting in Florence's 15th century Golden Age. Her prose amplifies the opulence and turbulence of the era. Both play a key role in Vittorio's transition. She builds suspense to his tragedy, his vengence and his seduction - leaving the reader thirsting for each page.Her main theme is one of choice. Vittorio begins as a victim, but ultimately makes his own tragic decisions. He is monitored by heaven and hell, but, like we readers, the angels and devils can only anticipate his path. In the end he is cursed to fully appreciate what he gained and lost each and every day.You may only enjoy the horror themes of this excellent yarn. Deeper, Rice reminds us that their can be horror in our daily decisions."
5,Another spledid masterpiece,"In Vittorio the Vampire, Anne Rice once again shows her amazing ability to carry a story line. This book, like her many others, is a total page turner. Her writing always 'takes me there' to the point that I can almost believe it's true. In this book, however, the character is very different, yet not so different, from the other heroes and heroines of her novels. The book takes place in mainly in Italy and ecompasses a new twist on vampiric humor and character. The ruby grail was a most interesting, yet new, twist on the social structure and appearance of a coven. Overall I loved the book and look forward to another."
4,Vittorio the Vampire,I loved this book so much I did not want it to end. Vittorio and Ursula were so good together. I was hoping for a miraculous ending. Please write another book about them and The Court of the Ruby Grail and there journeys in the beautiful Renaissance Italy. I can not help but to imagine how they would look if they were brought to life in a Motion Picture. This book let my imagination run WILD. Please continue there saga and life together.
2,Rehash of her better works.,"Oh man, what a stinker. Anne Rice must have needed some more money, so she rehashed the worst parts of her first three Vampire novels (agonizing pacing, annoyingly whiney vampires, etc.) into this pile of crap. Anne can still turn a good phrase and occasionally insert a neat new detail, but you're better off re-reading ""Interview..."" and praying that Anne gives it up before plunging into self-mockery."
1,Bor-ing!,"I find her so boring since she became well known. This book puts me to sleep, but I hope to finish it just to get closure. ""Interview With a Vampire"" was so innovative and ""The Mummy"" was also great, but I find her present writing style and storylines tiresome and her books uninspired."
1,A boring history of Florence,"Boy, did this one bite. Hoping that Rice's newest would be in the Tale of the Body Thief category, or quality, or that she found something else interesting to say, all I found was detailed Florentine history, of which I had my fill in Western Civ. classes. And the Satanic rituals outlined go completely against Lestat's philosophical apologies in previous novels. A book chronicling the history of Sesame Street's ""the Count"" (ah, ah, ah... one, one more Rice novel that was no good) would be better than this drivel."
2,An underdeveloped vampire yarn,"This book is overflowing with potential. The story is set in a fascinating period, the so-called Age of Gold during the Rennaisance in Italy, a time filled with art, political intrigue, and rapidly changing conventions. It is told through the eyes of a 16-year old boy, torn between the desire for avenging the death of his family at the hands of vampires and love for a female vampire. For those familiar with the other works of Anne Rice, you would expect these elements to yield a richly woven tapestry. However, the potential of the story is never realized.The book is pleasant and mildly diverting, but woefully thin in character development and plot. This is a short-story overly dressed as a novel. There is also an irritating excursion into pop spirituality with the introduction of angels. In short, this is far from Anne Rice's best work."
2,Staring at the sun through a telescope&#65533;.again&#65533;,I would refer to this book as a forced tooth extraction without novocaine. Lestat is nowhere to be found for the third time (third book). Since she dumped Lestat in the church the series has went downhill. This is my promise to Anne Rice: As long as the stories are kept at their current level and Lestat is not the prime character. My money will stay in my pocket.
2,this was awful...,"The end of the world must truly be at hand. All you have to do is look at Anne Rice's new book to know that even she is suceptable to these ends. I was so disappointed by this book, I was even looking forward to a story about a new vampire, but this was terrible, just a titch above the quality of her book ""All Soul's Eve"" which had a disappointing ending as well. This just seemed to be too much a regurgetation of past ideas, which were great the first time I read them. Anyhow, even if your an anne rice fan, it's still worth reading, if you have nothing better to do. I hope in the future she doesn't hurry so much to put a book out like this. I'd rather have a longer wait with the promise of something better quality."
5,Something new for once,"To fight off a wave of bad reviewers is easy simply because if you look at it from this angle, it's a truly amazing change of pace for our beloved Queen of the Vampires.For once this is a vampire who never mentions the name Lestat, or the words Dark Trick. We're brought into the perspective of a different vampire of a different tribe, and unlike the others, a different kind of past. Vittorio's family is destroyed by vampires, and as irony would have it, he himself is tricked into immortality by the woman he falls in love with.The story is both tragic and compelling at the same time, with conflict on every page, unlike the first four chronicles where the conflict starts up then peters out for a couple of pages, Vittorio provides us with nonstop horror and excitement."
5,A new vampire hero.,"Anne Rice has created a character in Vittorio the Vampire that I hope to read more of. Frankly, though I love Lestat, I am getting tired of him and feel like he has gone about as far as he can go, what with that boring Memnoch fiasco and all that. Vittorio could easily become a new vampire hero. He is what we expect of Anne Rice vampires, beautiful and brooding. Vittorio is strong and daring like Lestat, but is more like Louis in his sensitivity and introspection. I liked how the story was told from the mortal Vittorio's point of view. It is more effectively chilling to read of a mortal's dealings with the undead. Vittorio the Vampire is a wonderful, but short story. The end of the book came too soon. I was left wanting more, and I hope that was the book's intent. Hopefully this is not the last we read of Vittorio and his beautiful sire Ursula."
2,A Great Short Story,"Well what can I say? For the first time Anne Rice has dissapointed me. For one I would like to point out that this IS a short story, not a novel. The most distressing thing is she left out the vampire part. As usual she was great with the story background, however I was dissapointed with the characters. I'm sorry but putting 100 pages of print into a wide margined double spaced, huge type, does not make it a novel. All I can figure is she arrived at her deadline with what we've read and I can't help but think she never quite finished the story. C'mon Anne I want to read about Vittorio The VAMPIRE. It was good and the message was positive (though thinly veiled) But I would have liked to have read the whole story. I'm sorry but I feel cheated."
3,Slipping a little,"I'm normally a reader of mainstream fiction like The Triumph and the Glory, Havana Bay, and the Oprah books, but I've ALWAYS read Anne Rice because she is so incredibly talented. But Vittorio was a little weak in plot, character development and theme. Only the narration was upo to Rice's high standards set by her previous masterworks."
2,Disappointing!,I found this book very boring; I couldn't even finish it! Pandora was very good--I'd like to hear more about her story.
3,Disappointing but not disgraceful.,"I have enjoyed all of Anne Rice's books, though this one left a little to be desired. Vittorio was entertaining but I feel Mrs. Rice is trying to stretch the vampire chronicles beyond the breaking point. Why concentrate all her energies on the vampires when I believe the witch chronicles to be more interesting. I truly hope she writes more on the subject. All in all I would recommend other books she's writen before this one."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I've read all of Anne's novels and I really had a hard time with this one. I love descriptive novels, but this was ridiculous. Every page was a never-ending detailed description of Florence and Italian paintings, and yes, it's ""cultural"", but isn't this supposed to be a horror novel? I don't think I would recommend this book to anybody. Don't expect anything exciting in the plot either. Anne should stop writing such boring novels!"
2,At times recycling is a bad thing...,"I have just recentlty completed reading Ms. Rice's latest novel, Vittorio..., and near the end of the book I had this nagging feeling that I'd read this somewhere before... then it hit me... I have!It seems the well is running dry for Rice. All this book does is place the agonized Vampire, here named Vittorio instead of Louis, in yet another European setting. This time 15th-century Florence in lieu of 19th-century Paris. Instead of the Theatre du Vampire, we have the Court of the Ruby Grail. Both meet the same demise. LeStat had his Gabrielle, Louis his Claudia, Vittorio has his Ursula.At best, I found this book to be just average. I know nothing will top Interview...Eh ... just my two cents"
5,Very good zippo,Great zippo awesome finish and actually has the original insert (on mine at least) unlike 70% of the other zippos on amazon that have replaced inserts great replica of the ww2 one1
2,leaky,i like the feel and design for this light but it was really leaky and smoked half pack a day i had to refill it daily before i stopped using it
4,Nice finish on this lighter,Nicely made in usa product. The black crackle finish has a nice feel and the lighter is solidly built. The fit and finish of the lighter is excellent. Whoever says the usa cannot make good products for a good price does not know what they are talking about. Zippo is a good example of how good products made in the usa can be.
5,pretty good,this lighter is cool but i thought the finish would be deeper. It is cheaper thank MSRP but only by $5.
5,Great lighter,"I bought this lighter because I like the world war era lighters. They work very well and are very durable. Also, they come with the lifetime zippo warranty."
3,It's a Zippo,"Works pretty well, it's a lighter after all; it either works or it doesn't. Having said that I have trouble keeping it full enough to use. Maybe I'm over filling it and it's bleeding out or something. Never owned a Zippo before, just the disposable Bic's. I keep this around the house for lighting candles or fires in the fire pit.It's a lighter, it lights, it doesn't blow out easily. What's more to say?"
2,not what zippo used to be,"does it's job but this is not what i remember about zippo lighters. i thought these were sturdier but mine feels way too flimsy, the little hinge that holds the cap is loose. i don't think dealing with a return is worth my time given the price of the lighter."
5,Don't leave home without it,Zippo lighters are the best. I never leave home without this and it never lets me down. Great to have for outdoor activities as well.
4,A Great Lighter with a Small Problem.,"I got this Zippo lighter so I wouldn't have to continue to lose my lighters to greedy friends and lose them in between car seats and couch cushions. The actual canister of the lighter is high quality, as to be expected of Zippo. The case is very high quality as well, but the only gripe I had with it is that the actual ""crackle"" is smoother than I expected. This really doesn't kill the lighter for me. I did ding it a star for this, but that's not Zippo's fault. Overall, a great lighter and I am satisfied fully with it."
1,I never got it!,I could be a good lighter? I never got it at all. Don't know what it looks like. I payed $12.00 for nothing
4,Do Not Dry!!!!,"This cover is very well made. I have tried several brands of lesser quality & was always disappointed. Finally I just spent some extra $$ to get something worth using. That being said, it IS 100% cotton & it WILL shrink. Still functional, but considerably smaller coming out of the dryer."
5,Love this cover!,"This is, by far, one of my favorite items. I love the curved opening. It holds fabric up so it's away from baby's face while nursing and so I can see him. There is enough fabric to cover, so you don't feel exposed at all. I am very happy with this purchase and may get another just because I love it so much!"
4,Review for Teacher's Guide,"It was a good guide, but some bits of it were confusing for little kids. For others it worked well and was a great way to get Harry Potter taught in the classrom."
1,Arrived In Hundreds of Pieces,"When I read all of the great reviews about this light I decided to order it as it would look fantastic in our kitchen. After waiting for this product to arrive for over two weeks, I was happy when it finally did as we have been living without a light in the kitchen. When the postman handed me the box the sound inside was not encouraging - it was that of broken glass into many many pieces. Needless to say I refused the order and am currently waiting for Amazon to reimburse me - I won't be ordering from this company again."
4,"Good scale, very accurate","I had read that this was a great scale - accurate weight and body fat measurement. It also has a great price tag on it. I've had the scale for three years and it still works fine. I haven't had to change the batteries yet either. When I first got the scale, I had my body fat measured at the gym (water submersion) and on the scale. The results differed by just 1/2 percent.My only complaint is that it can be cumbersome to enter the information for body fat measurement. You must select Adult/Child, Male/Female and enter your height each time. I've read that there is a feature that remembers this information for two users, but I have not figured out how to use it yet."
2,Does not give the weight reliably!,"I really like the look & feel of this scale, but it is NOT reliable. It shows a difference of 4-5 pounds within a few days, and I know well that I don't fluctuate that much. It is also way off from the readings on my doctor's scale. I just don't know. I was somehow disappointed! :("
4,I hate this scale !,I hate this scale because it is so accurate and easy to use. Actually it is a very good scale and has served me well for the last 5 years or so. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in watching their weight. For a few dollars more you can get the feature that remembers your setup for BMI rather than having to enter your information each time. Overall a great scale.
2,"Worked for a while, then died...",This scale worked fine for me for about 2 years then died. Now I must replace it. I think it shold have lasted longer. It wasn't cheap as I recall.
2,too complicated!,It has too many features and is too fussy - you can't stand on it in your socks or if your feet are damp....and the readings are so easily thrown off - if you're dehydrated or just exercised or just ate.....enough -- I gave it away and am going to buy a simple one at the local bath store.
2,Inputting data every time is a pain,"I wanted a low end scale and went with this one. I was disappointed to find that you have to input the height every time to get fat calculations.Body fat calculations are off because it only measures how the electricity runs through one leg to the other, so if you carry your weight more in your legs and hips, it will be higher than it really is, if you carry your weight in your torso but not in your legs it will be lower. This is true of any of the home body fat scales however."
2,Does not store data,Contrary to the review below- others who have said that this unit does not store body fat data are correct. The person who says it does must have purchased a different model. I have carefully read the entire manual and there is no option on this model to store any data - you have to reenter it each time you want to check body fat. The weight measurement is off according to our old dial scale which closely correlated with to our last Dr. exams.
4,Scale review,"I like the fact that it calibrates every time before you use it, and it weighs my husband accurately, since he is over 225lbs."
3,Great for begginer not so great for intermediate or higher,"I been looking for a book that picks up where most strategy books fall short, and thats explaining how to formulate a plan. I purchased the book bc it had a chapter on it, but it tells you the concepts that of getting knight on a focal point etc etc but not how to actually plan it based on pawn structures. The only part I enjoyed in the book is the thirty chess puzzles."
2,Incomprehensible to the novice,"I'm a retired electronic engineer, and was looking for a hobby that might also provide a few bucks. After reading the book I decided that day trading would be too stressful for me. I then decided to read the book just for a better understanding of the way in which the stock market operates. I found it almost incomprehensible because it lacked discussion of the simple basics of stock trading. Apparently the authors assumed that the reader already well understood the mechanics of buy/sell in the market. One chapter on such material would have opened the way for a person such as myself to read some of the advanced ideas presented. I believe the authors are much better traders than they are writers."
1,Total waste of Money,"This book has undeservedly ridden the day trading wave of current popularity.A boring, uninformative look at traders and trading.Will not help u in any way to understand markets or trade profitably."
5,"Well job done, and I disagree with the","previous person that wrote two posts ago that the bokk is ""hard to understand."" Ha, I thought the exact opposite of the book as a whole. I would absolutley recommend this book over the other day trader book written by David Nassar."
2,"Scary to see this on Amazon's ""best seller"" list","It is really unfortunate that this is one of Amazon's ""best sellers."" Although I don't really advocate day trading, this book certainly won't help you overcome the fact that 90% of traders lose money.The Level II quote analysis is cursory at best. Also, the tips on how winning traders thin and act are platitudes. Check out Alexander Elder's ""Trading For A Living"" for the finest book on trading psychology instead.However, the book does present a good overview of SOES, SelectNet, ECNs, and how the New York and NASDAQ exchanges operate.This book is an attempt to cash in on the day trading frenzy. The book has several salient grammatical errors, suggesting that this book was rushed ""out the door.""Good luck on your day trading exploits! This book is not worth the purchase, but would be worth checking out in a library."
1,This book never should have been published. I returned mine.,"I got through less than a Chapter when I realized this was a terrible book for several reasons. First of all, the authors clearly need an editor. It is so poorly written that I was tempted to mark up the entire book with edits and send it back to the authors for the next edition. Then I realized that there should be no next edition. Also, this book reads like an advertisement for the authors' consulting services. Very tacky. I noticed also that the Co-Founder of Datek Online provides a positive quote in the Amazon review. Don't be fooled: The authors endorse the Datek system."
3,"Confusing, but still informative","If you want to get started in day trading, read this book numerous times because it's confusing in some areas. It is poorly written to a certain extent. However, this book is still very informative.For experienced traders, read chapter 5 only."
4,"For those already day trading, not for newbies.","This book is a great book for those already trading, wanting to know more and experience how others are succeeding. It will not provide you with what you need to know in order to start electronic trading. Must have some exposure of day trading before reading this book."
5,invaluable,"I've been investing online for a while. Three months ago I bought this book and studied it hard. Since then, I've been trading much more successfully taking crumbs off good old boys' table."
2,Highly disappointed,"The first indication that the author did not have much to say was apparent in the small size of the book. Then, when he tried to say something, he said it rather poorly. The book just couldn't seem to decide what it wanted to talk about. It jumped from topic to topic with no cohesiveness between the sections. In addition, the numerous plugs made was disheartening considering the amount of money I had to spend on this book.All in all a very basic overview of day trading. Of course I probably could have found ALL the information in this book on the web if I had made the effort. Sorry guys, try again."
1,No Longer in Business,"I gave the book one star because if he was so successful why did he and his company go out of business in 2002? The book gives you some good technical information on stock trading, but as a guide to making money in Day Trading begs the question ""Why is the author selling a book that advises the reader to follow up at his website for further training and services, when his company and website no longer exist?""I wish I had known that this guy is no longer in business and why he is no longer in business?"
4,"Positive, helpful approach","For a novice, getting information on this topic in the UK is impossible. There is real assistance available in this book, written by committed and experienced ex-street traders. However, while there are gems to be found, it is not a well structured book and not really for reference. Some parts are so detailed to be completely uncomprehensible, yet other parts were so thin that I will need to find help elswhere. I needed to keep notes to make sense.Do buy the book if you are new to this game - I saved the book price in my first half hour."
4,Excellent For New Day Traders,"This book is one of the best available for Day Trading. The authors both demonstrate their experience in the book.The single biggest disappointment is their recommendation for using Datek as an on-line broker. I tried them and found them to have the slowest, the very slowest, response time of all of the on-line brokers I tried. I think the authors should have been more aware of this shortcoming.All in all, an excellent choice!"
1,Want to trade for a living?,"While this book has a title which harnesses the latest fad, ""electronic"" day trading, it is not of much practical value unless you enjoy gambling and losing money. Your day trading career should be based upon a solid foundation rather than a book intended to cash-in on the latest trend. Save your money and buy ""Trading For A Living"" by Elder instead. You won't be sorry and your bank account will thank you!"
1,Wish I wouldnt have wasted money,"I was disappointed with this book. I agree with the others that say it is a sales pitch. It was too tecno minded and didnt help with the day to day information that is needed. Wade Cook has books out on stocks, and yes alot of his are sales pitches as well but at least there were a few points I could gleen from his book. Nothing was gained from reading Electronic Day Trader"
5,I read this book 6 times.,"I thought this book was fantastic. I had been day trading stocks full time for about 6 months before I read this book, and I found the information in it to be invaluable to me. There are very specific examples explaining how to interpret what the market makers are doing. Further, there is fairly specific information regarding market pull backs, counting levels and increasing my odds of getting in before the next run and getting out before the next pull back. This book is definitely up to date with all of the technology available to day traders. It also explains a lot of technical aspects of the markets regarding specialists, market makers, SOES (small order execution systems) and many more. Being an ex-electrical engineer, I found this book to be very specific, and detailed. I really don't like to read much, but I read this book 6 times in a matter of days. I really liked this book. If you day trade stocks, and use online software with level II quotes, this book is a must."
1,Clear as Milk,"With eight college degrees and a great deal of success in the early days of day trading I was sadly disappointed in the usefulness of the book. Largely repetitive, the authors fail to deal with the basics that would enable morepeople to approach day trading in the smart fashion."
5,For Those Those That Are Serious!,"This book is definately not meant to be casual reading material, I felt it was an education into the world of Electronic Day Trading. Interpreting the movements of the markets as well as the movements of the Market Makers was key for me turning my trading around and raising my bottom line quite nicely, this book helped to do that...Day Trading is not for everyone but this book helps give the reader a better understanding of what he or she is getting involved in before they put their money at risk! WELL DONE Friedfertig & West!"
1,Don't Bother Buying,"I was hoping to get into daytrading when i saw this book. I bought it, and felt that my money and time had been utterly wasted. It mostly was an encyclopedia about how the whole daytrading thing started, but it doesn't actually tell you how to get started. If you want to learn, don't buy it."
5,Much to deep for avarage clueless day traders,"Although very inlightening the book fails to meet the needs of the average daytrader who is in and out of the market in a matter of minunets. Granted this is not the approch one should take , it sertainly refelects what many traders are presently doing in the market. Therefore I feel the book missed its intended forum to enlighten and educate."
2,"Another ""How-to""","The non-fiction books of the New York Times Best Selling List contains a majority of layman ""how to"" books. This one promises you can do the same kind of trades the big investors do and reap the same reward. If you believe it's all that simple, then this book is for you. If you don't, you'll save a lot of time, money, and anxiety."
4,Even more powerful with trading psychology,A sound book that covers it's material well. Day trading is so much about trading psychology that I found this book even more powerful when I combined it's lessons with those from The Mind of a Trader (FT Pitman). Personally I think combinations of books make for better trading education.
3,How to out smart the Market Maker and lose.,"OK, I did not read the hard cover, but have read the softcover. Anything that sounds to good to be true is. I am ex SOES trader. Ran out of funds after 8 months. Most people I saw in the two SOES office's that I work in lost $5,000 - $10,000 before they got the hang of it. See Forbes and Business week. On positive side you must understand tricks and methods of Market Makers if you are a Day Trader. Someone who is back in cash every night. Also tips on trading out of an office with others is a plus. Remember that in last two years anyone with a buy button made money investing. Trading is not investing."
2,No reason this should be a bestseller,"A very DECENT (e.g., unremarkable) book about day trading. Ninety-five percent of people do not have access or would not want to pay for the technology discussed in this book. Even if an individual did possess all the ECN's, NASDAQ level II quotes, and such, it is doubtful they would excel at day trading since Friedfertig can barely get past his discussion of NASDAQ fraud (complete with photocopied NYTIMES articles)to describe how to actually day trade. This is in itself is a pretty limited discussion. If you want simple advice on good stocks, the best source of information is the Wall Street Wizard."
4,This WILL HELP the common investor understand:,":It helped me understand the vast differences between trading a stock on the NASDAQ versus trading NYSE and AMEX listed stocks: How MM's can AND DO manipulate prices to their advantage (and your DISadvantage on the NASDAQ, and it's LEGAL. The book also covered about every area you can think of. It's choices of Online Brokers are outdated, but then again, THESE types of things change almost Daily due to new services offered, and lower rates offered."
2,This book is arranged from complex to basic.,"I'm trying to educate myself with this type of trading. I've read this book 2 times and it is quite confusing. This could have been written better had the author explained the basics of this style of trading. As the reader progresses, apply the examples found on the earlier parts of the book. The target audience for this book is not intended for beginners. I've read many books about investing, but this is difficult to comprehend."
1,what a waste of money!!! zero star,"Not only is the material poorly organized, the book offers very little in terms of useful trading information. The book is basically a plug for the authors' classes and trading firm. The kind of daytrading techniques they advocate will only fatten their wallets. To wit: One of the most successful daytraders that works in their firm who was profiled in some financial magazine actually paid 43% of gross profits in transaction fees!!"
1,Zero Star Title,Very little information here to help you trade successfully.I'm amazed that anyone could have anything positive to say about this inadequate title.
1,beware!,This book and others on the subject of day trading do not mention the changes in the markets which would eliminate the edge that the current breed of daytraders enjoyed so far.
3,OK but not helpful by itself for beginners,"I learned a few things from this book, but not much. SAVE PENNIES, BANK MILLIONS by Helsa and Glaurys Ariass was excellent. I refer to both of these books when I trade/invest--my hidden treasure!"
4,Not for the beginner...,"I found this book easy to read but for a beginner there are numerious expressions, which unfortunatley nowhere were discussed in detail in this book."
3,Sometimes Difficult To Follow...But Some Useful Information,"Although the writers clearly understand the subject matter well, conveying the information in easy to understand language is sorely lacking throughout much of the book. It is difficult to figure out exactly who the authors intended the audience of this book to be, as some sections seem to be written only for highly knowledgeable and experienced traders, but other sections are down to earth and offer clear understandable concepts. Most of the book is not really for the novice.Basically, I didn't get as much as I wanted from the book, but I know more than when I started reading it."
1,Electronic Day Trader is hard to follow for a beginner.,"The Electroninc Day Trader didn't take the time to go over the basics of trading stocks. It used a lot of terms that the beginner would not understand. The book ""Day Trade Online"" by Christopher Farrell did a much better job in explaining in detail what terms meant and took you through the trading process step by step. I would give that book 5 stars!"
3,crab crackers slightly less than cracked up to be,"These crab crackers (AKA lobster crackers) were slightly smaller than the ones I own, those they look the same. They appear slightly less substantial as well. They seem to work fine though."
4,Very beautiful,"The bracelet is very beautiful, altough I expected it to be bigger. As a suggestion, maybe a photo with a person wearing it would have helped to imagine the right size before purchase."
5,Wow... both sides A+,there is 2 sides to an album... production and lyrics/flow...the produciton on this album is straight RAW! if you like UG next level type stuff... then these beats hit the spot! the production on this album is EXCELLENT! very impressed!!!the lyrics/flow on this album are quite exeptional... also impressed.. a different style but doesnt take long to get used to and enjoy...if you like raw straight up hiphop that doesnt sound like any commercial BS... then this album needs to be picked up.
2,only had two cuts,"had the skills for a slow rapper,the way he flowed but somthing was missing,not a good cd had afew cuts though but couldnt keep up with the heavy hitters so i gave this a two star cer from oh10"
4,penultimate,so far so good. i dont recolect the power of achievment but with more practice I expect the best. how about the third riech. maybe =the golden chilkdren.
2,There are better choices in Hip-Hop!,"If you value your money like I do, borrow this CD from someone. They shouldn't be mad because you will probably return it the same day."
1,Please! Mediocrity at best!,"What an absolute disappointment. After reading all the reviews on here I really had my hopes up. BIG mistake. This kid is SOOOOO overrated its unbelievable. All his rhymes are forced and unoriginal. I love hip-hop, but this kid is just wack. Listen to some Latyrx or Aceyalone instead. Even....I dunno...Notorious BIG has better rhymes. Gimme a break."
5,DEDICATED TRUE HIP HOP,"I have been with Jeru,ever since he first dropped,and it is always a good feeling to hear him continuing his ways of innovation and expression.Producer/DJ Premier is again in majestic form,as he lays down superb tracks for Jeru to bless knowledge over.On ""Physical Stamina"",a younger Afu-Ra lyrically shines and exchanges verses with Jeru.The classics off of this album are ""Whatever"",""Me Or The Papes"",""Too Perverted"",""Ya Playin' Yaself"",and ""Invasion"".""Invasion"" is argueably the best track on this album.Primo also scratches in an awesome Nas word sample that is soooo ill,which serves as the hook and title influence for this song.Jeru again demonstrates that you can never stop a Prophet,who is dedicated to representing true Hip Hop.This album is a must for any pure Hip Hop supporter,listener,or performer out there. ONE......."
5,ILL,"this cd is phat.good loops and beats,the rhymes are excellent,the bass is off tha wall! i truely recommend this album to everybody who loves real hip hop.this is a true masterpiece,just like""the sun rises in the east"".peacep.s.does anybody know that song from jeru and these spanish mc's ""violadores del verso""?if somebody does,please write a review on this page sometime.aight"
1,Sony NH-14WM replacement battery,"My order was recieved in reasonable time. The item appeared to be new, genuine, and with it's original factory-sealed bubble-pack package intact. I was eventually able to charge the battery per owner's manual instructions, and the battery then appeared to be working fine.But, the new as-received battery initially did not take a charge, and I suspected that the contacts might have built up some invisible tarnish due to long on-the-shelf aging. So I lightly polished the contacts on each end of the battery with a few strokes on the sole of a leather-soled shoe. This seemed to resolve the initial problem, and the battery then seemed to charge and work in my Sony MiniDisk recorder.But, I then discoverd that the record time was much shorter than my original Sony battery, and a fully charged battery seems to run down on it's own in less than a month. So, these are apparently stale batteries being sold as new."
1,Not worth the money. It doesn't work and doesn't hold a charge,"Length:: 1:26 MinsNikon EN-EL3e Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for D200, D300, D700 and D80 Digital SLR Cameras"
4,"Good sight, but batteries are an issue","The site is good, effective. Solid mounting, easy to adjust, good value. But it's easy to leave light on and burn out the batteries. These batteries are very difficult to find, and you really need the light, when hunting at dawn or dusk (when the deer move)."
4,Perfect sights for the price,"This site is a great piece of equipment for the money. I paid less than 50% of what other retailers were trying to sell it for. This sight is made of plastic so if this sight is for a child then one tumble might break the sights, but if you're an adult and you take care of it, I don't see why it'd ever break on you. The LED lights up the sights which is very nice when target shooting in the evening or morning before work. The 5 pin really gives you that adjustability to have those pins available in 10 yard increments. Great product, I absolutely love it."
1,Does not fit in the Samsung D807,"I bought this as a replacement for a fading battery. It fits into a different phone, apparently. The orientation is exactly opposite of that of my phone. Very disappointed, but the hassle and cost of the return is not worth it to me."
1,Leg fell off and got lost,"The expanding basket part is OK. But -- you attach the three springy legs to the bottom of the basket by pinching them closed and sliding their feet into slots. They then expand again and are supposed to stay in place. In the first week one leg came off and got lost. The basket is useless since it won't sit upright in a pot. In my opinion, the product was not designed well."
3,"not bad, not great.","Legs and center handle never really attached securely. I like the collapsing style so it fits in nearly all of my pots and pans and is easy to store. After a year or two of moderate use the individual wings began to come loose and it was noticeably scratching some of my dishes. It's a simple contraption that meets a simple need and produces delicious and nutritious food but I'm not going to get this particular style of steaming basket again.You should own a steaming basket if you cook your own food. You could do worse, you could do better."
3,Subtitles,Maybe it was just my player but the Subtitles option didn't work. The audio was in Spanish and there was no DVD menu option for any sort of English.
3,Ellington was Not a Street,"Excellent illustrations, this would be a good review of early 20th century black history. It doesn't tell you anything new and is not the story on Ellington that I was looking for. Still well done, just very short."
5,REMARKABLE,THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS BOOK.I LOVE THIS BOOK.THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE JUST WONDERFUL.THIS BOOK REALLY REPRESENTS THE CLASS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.THE LITTLE GIRL ON THE FRONT COVER IS JUST ADORABLE AND SHE IS DRAWN SO BEAUTIIFULLY WITH VERY DISTINCT AFRICAN AMERICAN FEATURES!!!! THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE LOVE!!!!
3,"Ellington was not a street, and this book is not a biography","This book doesn't do much. It's an illustrated poem, and the illustrations are good, but the poem is... unimportant? It tells about being around some of the great black men who changed the world, but the perspective is that all this stuff was going on over the head of a little girl.The illustrations save this book.The notable men (all men) include socialists/communists (Paul Robeson, Kwame Nkrumah, W.E.B. DuBois), a boxer (Virgil Akins), and musicians of all sorts (Ray Baretto, ""Sonny Til"" Tighman, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, the Clovers)."
5,Ellington Was not a Street should have won the Caldecott,I think Ellington Was Not a Street should have won the Caldecott because it had very realistc and large drawings. The drawings also helped tell the story because there were very few words on the page. I would reccomend this book for ages 9 to 19.
3,"While I used this product, the area around ...","While I used this product, the area around my eyes felt firmer. I can't really say that the appearance changed much. In all fairness, however, the product instructs you to use it for 12 weeks for a visible difference and I've used it for only about 10 days. I will definitely continue to use it because my skin does feel better to me."
4,"The more I've used this product, the better ...","The more I've used this product, the better it's worked. There's been a noticeable difference in the disappearance of fine lines, as well as the more defined """"smile lines"""" around my mouth. It's far superior to nearly all other similar products I've used in the past few years -- easy application and much cheaper, too! I would especially recommend to the """"baby boomers"""" of the world to give it a try!"
2,cheap,"This looked ok in the picture but actually it is very cheaply made, which is what you get for paying so little."
2,Cheaply made,"When received, the hands had to be placed on the clock and it was very cheaply made. Cost more than it was worth!"
3,: ),"love the clock... but don't touch any part of the hands or it won't work... It is unprotected in terms of the second hand, hour hand and minute hand.... so, just be cautious to not move any part of the hands as it will stop completely... but it is actually quite nice.. smaller than what i excpected! : )"
4,An historical review for those who liked In Absentia,"This album covers the best of Porcupine Tree under a fairly obscure label named Delirium. Because the cuts are sifted from a lot of material, the overall quality is good. I particularly like the title cut, Stars Die, which is the first cut on disc 2.In fact, if you came to Porcupine Tree via In Absentia (a great album, by the way), you'll probably like disc 2 more than disc 1. The early material on disc 1 is more psychedelic, and I wouldn't really call it progressive.But be aware that this album, even disc 2, is considerable more subdued than In Absentia. If you really liked In Absentia, you should give this one a try, but be aware that Porcupine Tree has come a long way."
5,.... and Stars are born!,"Excellent compilation with two previously unreleased tracks, this sounds like it was meant to be as it is. If you don't have any of PT's early albums (first 5 + 1)(""Stupid Dream"" & ""Lightbulb Sun"" are the latest with ""Recordings"" having most of their B sides)this one is a perfect buy, it includes music from ""On the Sunday of Live"", ""Voyage 34"", ""Up the Downstair"" (+ ""Staircase Infinity""), ""The Sky Moves Sideways"" and ""Signify"". I've been listening to PT for two years and having ordered and listened to all their stuff that's available, still ran and bought Stars Die and loved it; can't wait for their next album due out sometime this year...This band deserves more radio play in this Stiff and Boring American Radio Market....A must for any good music lover...."
1,Mediocre at best,"I bought this based on the reviews given here and have to admit it was a mistake. This is elevator music from some stoned Pink Floyd devotees. I don't mind listening to it, but it's not something I look forward to. Try ""In Absentia"" from the same group - much better!"
5,Very pleasant sounding....especially for any Dead freak.,"If you just listen to it for what it is, this album is great. Bobby sounds great, with very nice renditions of ""easy to slip"" and ""shade of grey"". I love the ""victim"" on this cd as well. I dont know what else to say. Its a great CD for lying in bed, solo or otherwise."
5,Bioplex WPI Natural is the best,"I am over 60 and use whey protein to maintain muscle mass. I am 175 cm and 75kg, with a BMI of 25. I don't know about the muscle mass, but since taking protein supplements I feel better and have more energy. The WPI natural is additive-free, mixes as good as any, and doesn't change the taste of milk, So it is good on cereal in the morning and ice cream at night. I have tried 10 other brands and this is the best. I love it because it just makes me feel good."
3,Early jazz album from bossa-nova era Brazil,"Luiz Chaves e Seu Conjunto""Projecao""This is an early bossa nova jazz album from bassist Luiz Chaves and pianist Hamilton (Amilton) Godoy, who later founded the long-lived Zimbo Trio. It's a swinging set of big band-ish versions of bossa nova standards, and a good indication of what the Brazilian jazz combos of the early 1960s sounded like. Originally released in 1963 on the RGE label. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
1,yuk,Forget the cheese sauce...the only way to use this product is to leave off the last step...they instruct you after cooking the product then to add the thick gooey cheese sauce which just ruins it....I purchased a case of these...so before I cook them I add spices or herbs of choice and then after cooking I top with melted butter...I save the sauce packet for nachos..
1,Did not work for me,"In fact for the 2 weeks I used it the cracks on my fingertips got worse. And it's strange that a product for dry skin would contain alcohol.Was looking for a replacement for Laid in Montana's Workers Cream, because while it works great it is very greasy. Guess I'll have to stick to the greasy stuff"
3,lotion,The product is very good but the new style cap is very BAD! Need to go back to the old style.
5,works great,A little antiseptic at first but the smell quickly dissipates and does not leave an oily residue. Works great. I highly recommend it!
1,Not enough bang for your buck,"If you have dry, itchy skin especially in the winter time as I do, this is not the product for you. I am very disappointed with this product and due to my experience with this product, I'm wondering if the people who reviewed this product actually own it or work for the company. I compared it with a much less expensive product that I already owned and it appeared to make my skin dryer than the other product. This product is not only overpriced on the Amazon website but it does not do what it claims to do. Will not purchase again and wish I could return it."
2,Didn't help,Nothing like advertised. Still have problems with my skin drying out and cracking. Not worth the money in my book.
5,Lotion absorbs quickly and it works,Why bother with a cream that sits on your skin when this amazing lotion is available. There is no stickiness and the lotion is especially good for freshly shaved legs.
5,Loved the whole different story and how she became,"I love this movie since the first time I saw it, back when it first cameout. I have been looking for soooo long, and I just knew that Amazon.comwould have it so I just tried yestersday and sure enough they did, so Iordered it and it will probaly come tomorrow. I can't wait to see it but I still remember what the movie is all about, the best part is at the end what a shocker Stockard Channing was great. I just have to say I lovedthe way she changed sooo much it was incredible.MA. Carol Brown"
5,GREAT DARK COMEDY BY LEDGEND JOAN RIVERS,"Saw this movie on tv when it first aired and just loved it. Recently purchased and watched it again and was thrilled that it held up so well. The actors and action goes along so well, but let's face it, it all starts with the written word. Joan Rivers is such a multi-talented lady--wish she had written more movies. (I am probably one of the few people who actually liked ""Rabbit Test"")This is the best revenge movie I have ever seen--- the ending is unusual -- for the time and even today. You will see some familiar faces that were quite young then, and went on to greater fame. Of course, Stockard Channing is fabulous.The premise is great, the casting is great and just the whole package is, well, great."
4,Stockard!,"This made-for-tv film is superb. It's a cheesy classic. Written by Joan Rivers and starring Stockard Channing. Anyone who was made fun of in High School and beyond will adorate this film. It's 'our' fantasy, played out on the tube. I loved it when released, I love it now. Some things never change: Like a good film. Buy and watch... Over and over......"
5,This tour is WELL worth a listen. LTJ is a digital genius.,"There are dj's, there is techno, and then there is LTJ Bukem, and his sound puts all others to shame. His is a perfect balance of sweet trance melodies and fast, deep drum and bass the likes of which have never been heard before. He has the mellow soul of DJ Shadow, the complexity of Coltrane and Goldie, and impeccable timing to match. Watching this man spin with total concentration for over two hours straight is amazing. Definitely not a tour, or a cd to be missed."
5,Amazing album...but there are two versions,"First things first, the cd you are looking at, Logical Progressions the 2-disc set is absolutely amazing. Perfect introduction to the genre but also pure enough to stand the test of time. The songs have an excellent spacey quality, all very melodic and not noisy and mean sounding.Now to clear up some confusion: this is NOT the same disc as ""Logical Progression Level 1"" even though tehy have the same cover. ""Level 1"" is a 3 disc set. Disc one and two are completely different songs than on this particular collection. Disc 3 however is a mix of kind of the ""Best of"" from the logical collection you are looking at right now. Confusing? yes. Both good cds? Very."
5,AGREEMENT!,"L.T.J BUKEM WAS A TOTAL STRANGER JUST ONE SECOND AGO! I HAD BARELY HEARD HIS NAME SUGGESTED AND ""LOGICAL PROGRESSION"" WAS BETTER THAN I EVER COULD DREAM OF!!!!! i have to buy it now! ""links"" is one of the highlights."
5,ltj bukem = cornerstone of the genre,"its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words. suffice to say, level 1 is a timeless classic, in fact, it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b. logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads & music lovers in general. demon's theme, western, danny's song & horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre. bukem's level 1 displays his flawless production & track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline & ambient bliss."
2,Dull music with annoying samples,Perhaps disc-a is better than disc-b but I've lost that somewhere :( Disc-b is really quite dull though. The music lacks content and is full of very repetetive annoying samples. Don't get me wrong - I like Drum & Bass and Techno - but this mix is irritating and dull.
5,Essential Intelligent DNB,"A classic release. Before DNB turned too aggressive and still retained some ambient/jazzy/housey vibes, this was the cream of the crop. A crystalized moment in a fast-progressing genre, but one that I'm more than happy to revisit over and over."
2,definitely NOT the best,"This refers to the double CD edition (not ""Level 1""): Neither good dnb nor ambient. This compilation is likable after listenieng to it a few times but it lacks both originality and excitement in my opinion. Almost all tracks follow the same pattern, the drums are rather uniform making it sound like d'n'b has nothing more to offer. If you like smooth repetitive grooves than it may be your thing but if you want to listen to some good d'n'b check the likes of Roni Size or Talving Singh instead. There are a few pieces that have some interesting loops and rhythms and a good ambiental feeling to it (note though ""So Long"" on disc a seems to be influenced by #5, disc 1 on Selected Ambient Works vol.II by Aphex Twin) but these are few and far between to make up for the overall dull feeling of the compilation."

5,The Golden Age of GLR,This is the album that introduced me to LTJ and Good Looking back in the day. An absolute classic.
4,"A spine-tingling, goose-bump inducing selection.","A great offering taking the listener on a journey across the spectrum of drum & bass. Heavenly trancey melodies and charged, skull-cracking beats make you want each and every track playing at full-volume inside your head. Fantastically smooth transitions mean that you will be wearing your CD player out with this.I picked this up over here after collecting the ""Earth"" volumes back home and it hasn't left the CD tray yet. My only hope is that quality drum & bass, from the likes of these artists, with enjoy the explosive popularity it does back home. Go buy, and then spread the word - you'll be very glad you did."
3,Just OK,"These shades are very thin and shiny silver on both sides. I prefer the kind that are black on one side. They block out some of the sun, but not as much as the two-tone fabric shades."
5,Just the right item for those hot days,Item arrived quickly and it is just like it was described. This is the best and easiest type of Sunshade I ever used and it is my 3 rd one in the household. I had to acquire this smaller one since I now have a car with much smaller windsheld.
3,Be Aware...,"I can't help but put my two cents in here. I bought this item 'cuz the ad said the Magic Shade was expandable to fit a ""wide variety of vehicles"" - well, the two sheets included in the ""Basix"" set are not enough to cover my Sienna's windshield!!! As a matter of fact the PACKAGING specifies that you need a larger size, the Jumbo or Super-Jumbo, for a Sienna, and other vans. I sure would have liked the ad to say something similar!!!The folding instructions are so minimal as to be essentially useless. The trick is that as you fold the pair of shades, they buckle into an accordion of small 'circles'. As they do, you must twist the right-upper-'circle' UNDERNEATH the left-upper, in order to get the strap over the then-jiffypop-like stack. This takes a little practice, but I doubt it takes ME a second - NOW!"
1,Bad quality,The size doesn't fit.The material is too thin and there are holes on the rim already. I only used it for several times.
2,Car Sun Shade,Not very durable--already has a hole in one of the shades. Okay as far as keeping the sun out. It is still pretty hot in my car when I get in it at the end of the day.
4,Great Sunshade for the price!,"I bought this a couple weeks ago and it works fantastic. For about 8 dollars, it folds down easily into nothing and does the job of keeping some of the heat out. I'd highly recommend this if you're in the market for a shade and don't want to spend alot. I read some reviews about the size of the shade being an issue, but I drive a 1991 Mercedes 300E and find this fits it great."
3,Car Sunshade,"The sunshade is functional. For my application they are too large. I got these because the stated size indicated they were smaller than other sunshades I've seen. I got them for a 2010 Mustang, but they are too large. Construction seems fine. Perhaps I'll use them for another car."
4,Works Good,"This product work well. I'm sure it's not the best shade out there but it seems to work good in the Florida sun. It fits well in my '07 CR-V. If you're going to fold this up every time because you don't have any space in the back, then find something else. It can get annoying when folding it."
3,Size Matters,"The product itself is great, just be careful to get the proper size. The description indicated it would fit my make and model of automobile, but it lacked about 1.5 inches to fit properly. I have to do a delicate balancing act to get them to stay up."
2,The anti-Nike: Just don't do it.,"These things are so thin, I am surprised they even work. They are cheaply made...maybe a notch above what you could find at your local dollar store. I have a Honda Civic and they BARELY fit in there. By that, I mean they are too SMALL. If you have a big car, GOOD LUCK. I will use until they are ready for trash bin...which I give about 6 months."
3,"Not large enough for our ""2003 Mazda Protege 5"".","The sizes available on the auto-shade magic shade package are, Standard or Jumbo. The one I received has a red check on the Standard size. Unfortunately, this size is too small for our, ""2003 Mazda Protege 5"". I wish we would have been able to order the Jumbo size."
4,Very good psych reference!,This is an exceptional psych reference on personality disorders...there is a website that you can download the pdf if you cannot afford to purchase at cassiopaea.org.
1,is the author a psychopath?,"Seems curious that the author spends so many words getting to the point in each case.... each one so drawn out that once half-way through the book - cases after case after case - it become apparent that Cleckley is doing more to create his own ""work of art"" than to educate the reader on the topic. Further, according to his case studies, one would get the idea that psychopath are pron to extreme use of alcohol. This is not the case with several psychopath I have come in contact with. Once I became suspect that the author could be playing a role, I noted the titles of two other books he has authored which causes again to suspect Cleckley is either a psychopath himself or extremely narcissistic."
1,Pseudo-science,"This is an important subject that deserves a study that is impartial, objective, and in the spirit of scientific inquiry. This book is none of these things.After padding many pages with case histories that could be found anywhere, the author finally makes it clear that his definition of a psychopath is anyone of whose beliefs, philosophy, or artistic endeavors he disapproves.Throughout the book, pseudo-scientific language is used to rationalize the author's prejudices. The highly judgmental tone of this book makes it worthless as a serious study."

The highly judgmental tone of this book makes it worthless as a serious study."
2,what is clarified in this book?,The psychological condition is not clarified in this book as stated. This at best is an overview of behaviors you might notice of sociopath/psychopath. There is no reason to pay such a high price for this epitome. It is an epitome at best. But no psychological meaning here. A failed attempt.
5,"Belongs in everyone's life list of ""Ten Best"" books.","There is no need to add more detail to the previous, eloquent reviews except to say ""absolutely and amen!"" Everyone, professional on down, should read this book to understand and deal with (or avoid) the devils among us in every walk of life. Our young people must read it; it should be on every required reading list (sadly, it is not). The Mask of Sanity describes, explains, and exposes the tactics of these monsterous people that cause heartbreat and havoc...and worse. Reading this book essentially saved my life. Give it to your children and friends. It will be one of the greatest gifts you will ever give them. There are more phychopaths/sociopaths out there than one can ever imagine. Protect yourself: learn about them. This is the book to do that. It will never be out of date."
5,Still Worth Reading,"Some say Cleckley is outdated. I say ""Never""! Cleckley doesn't deal in his book with hardened criminals or serial killers, but rather the kinds of psychopaths that wandered into his practice. For this reason, there are no heinous crimes to distract or any anger to make us turn away, but rather we can observe with a more detached curiosity and learn a lot about the nature of psychopaths.Pat Brown/Director/Investigative Criminal Profiler/The Sexual Homicide Exchange, Inc."
2,Weaknesses,"Clinical Mycology is on balance weak in many areas, but most notably diagnosing trauma related opportunistic fungal bone infections. Many references are made to ""uncommon"" and ""unusual"" cases, but little mention is given to diagnostic methodolgy. See Clinical Mycology Online--""Opportunistic Fungal Infections"" Reference--""Aspergillus seldom isolated from blood, urine, CSF."" Author doesn't tell you that C.T. scans are an unreliable tool for diagnosing some fungal infections. See A.M. Sugar & C. A. Lyman ""A Practical Guide To Medically Important Fungi And The Diseases They Cause"" P.69 This is minimum information that you will not find in this book. A better alternative are two books, one by Fisher/Cook ""Fundamentals of Diagnostic Mycology"" and the other by Sugar/Lyman. Of course, there are also many strong articles worth reading in this book, and for that reason it is worth bookshelf space--"
4,great design but ok quality,"I too love the design of this set, but I was not super impressed with the quality. It wasn't that expensive though, so I am still happy with it.Just for the record my set included a bedskirt, two window valances, one sage green crib sheet, a bumper, diaper stacker, wall hanging with storage pockets (seen above changing table in picture), a quilt and a small pillow. So those are the nine pieces you get in the set.The sheet shrunk so much after I gave it a cold water wash and hung it to dry that it no longer fit over my mattress. And the bottom of the diaper stacker has a piece of cardboard in it to help keep it from bowing, which it still does.If you love the design like I did, and don't mind buying your own crib sheets, you will be happy with it. However, if you are looking for high quality and craftsmanship, you might want to keep looking."
2,Really Disappointed in quality,I was so excited when I ordered this only to be disappointed. The quality of the bedding is terrible. The sheet is so rough I bought a differnt brand and the bedding quality is less than par. I kept the set but I doubt it will hold up past 1 washing.
4,Lovely watch!,Bought this at Amazon. Great value as it would have cost 800 in Ireland. A beautifully crafted watch - very robust and it looks great. Only thing I don't like is that you have to manually change the date on months less than 30 days.
5,Speaking my thoughts,"First of all, books like this should get more publicity, as the ones who do not get to read books like this one, are losing out on something so thoughtprovoking and beautiful. The language is simple, yet beautiful. It gets you thinking about your own life and how you are notcapable like the author in penning it down so well.When I read the portion, where the author has to keep moving from placeto place all over India, and in the process keep leaving friends behind, I keep thinking of my daughter who has done the same, due to the fact that her father had a transferable job and it was heartbreaking to see her go through the agony of changing schools and in the process her friends(who she fears she will never beable to meet again). As a result of all these moves in her life, we had to send her to a boarding school at age 10 in order to give her stability.I wish the author would write a sequel to this book.Sridevi Rao"
1,If Only They Could Talk,"BEWARE, I purchased this series thinking they were a continuation of James Heriot's first four but to my disapointment the publisher riped off the public by reprinted the original stories under a new title. I tryed to return them but gave up and donated them to the local library"
3,Not her best....,I love Francoise - I grew up listening to her records in my Dad's collection. So I really don't like saying that I'm not a huge fan of one of her albums but... This CD just really doesn't showcase her talent very well. I'd suggest choosing another.
5,An Excellent Series Continues,"This third volume in the series comes with beautiful cover art by Stephen Fabian and nine superb short stories (plus two poems) by the master of heroic fantasy. Every tale in the book is a great read, several of these being Lovecraft inspired, and there are fascinating characters: Cormac of Connacht, Solomon Kane, Black Turlogh, and Athelstane. I highly recommend it, and expect this series to only get better."
1,Price is just a bate,"This came within the time stated. I bought this as a gift, it was advertised as $28.95 and when I saw the bill, I was charged $45.98. The item is nice but don't get bated by the advertised price, keep looking for something else.Tuxedo Cufflinks and Studs - Black Onyx with Silver Tone by Cuff-Daddy"
2,Not very sturdy/durable,"They work fine as fasteners, are decent looking (if plain) and are pretty cheap, but not very durable. The black face of one of the studs fell off after two uses, leaving only the silver body. The other studs and cufflinks have held up fine, but it's still annoying.I guess I shouldn't have expected more given the price, but I wouldn't recommend these. Spring a little extra for a set that is more durable and can be used longer."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!,"I strongly suggest that you do not buy this product. I was looking to get something that looked decent for a tuxedo I have, and while this product was more expensive it seemed a reasonable buy. The product, however, was extremely poor quality. Literally I took it out of the box the day of my Chamber of Commerce event, and while putting it into the shirt one of the buttons literally broke in half. Another button had the black insert fall out and thus I could not use it as I did not have glue to put the black insert back in. I was able to wear the remaining items without incident, but it is pretty clear that the quality is not something I expect to get much use out of. Terrible product. Look elsewhere."
5,Great underrated album from the sugary-voiced soulstress,"One of Deniece Williams's least talked about albums (and one of only 2 or 3 not available as a CD), this one is as good and solid as anything she's made. She's in great vocal form on the soft, lilting title track, once again has great chemistry with the legendary Johnny Mathis on the duet with him ""So Deep In Love,"" and start's moving into the more dance-oriented material that would dominate her next album with the bouncy, perky ""Heaven In Your Eyes."" Nothing here is quite as catchy as ""Let's Hear It For The Boy,"" but in most ways, this is classic DW and pleasant listening by all means."
5,The Goto Guide for any Notes Administrator / Developer,I have been a Notes Administrator for a little more than 4 years and this book hasn't left my side since notes went to the R5 version. It touches on all admin and development topics that most real world Notes Administrators and Developers need to deal with on a daily basis. Comparing it to other books I would say it definitely is easier to follow and find the topic that you are looking for than any other Domino book out there to date. I highly recommend this book for beginners and Intermediate level Administrator / Developers.
1,Worthless for an experienced Domino developer,I found this book completely worthless. All of the descriptions are pure fluff with no advanced knowledge of how Domino functions. Each time I look for something it either is not covered or has some generic description. There are no complex code examples and no explanations of element functionality and limitations. This book is an awful waste of money!
4,Exceptional introduction to the American Revolution,"Following a recent visit to Yorktown, I wanted to know why it warranted so much attention. Bruce Lancaster has done an exceptional job of building a picture that helped me truly appreciate the significance of Yorktown.I love Lancaster's clear, rapid narrative of the war and surrounding events. Sure, he has some flare that may not be in vogue these days, but that is one reason why this book is so good. He writes with conviction and style, bringing the characters in the war to life. He also does an outstanding job of helping the reader piece together the critical events in the war. This is a book that makes you want to read more about the period."
2,I see why it was so inexpensive,I have a laptop and had to attach the light to the side of it instead of the back. I think I am going to have to use tape or something to keep it over the keys! It won't stay in the position that I 'flex' it in. It just slowly moves downward after being plugged into the port.
3,Netbook Light,The light is bright but does not give enough coverage over the keyboard region. This results in you being unable to see all areas of the keyboard easily.
4,"New York, New York","I like this disk, but it is worth buying solely for the Row Jimmy, which is so good it makes one wonder how a handful of musicians could put together such beauty. For anyone who knows the Dead, you will know that the dead are bad on their off nights and unbelievable on their good nights. This disk is neither bad nor unbelievable, mearly good. I don't like the Brent songs such as Blow Away, I Will Take You Home, and Just A Little Light, but that is just me. This disk does, however, represent a period of time where the Dead were at one of their peaks. There are some good tracks on this 3 disk set such as, of course, Row Jimmy...., Masterpiece, Disk 2, and Brokedown Palace. To experience other peak times, I suggest Live Without a Net, which I consider the best live recording I have ever heard. Other exceptional disk are (Although not all Dead recordings); Jerry Garcia Band, How Sweet It Is, Shady Grove, and the excellent Dick's Picks series."
4,good...for a Mydland show,I don't really like anything but early '70's shows..but this one was pretty remarkable.
2,Too much '90 GD in circulation... Good music but redundant.,"While I would like ""Dozin'"" very much if I did not own many live Grateful Dead discs. However, with so many official recordings out there from 1990 (not only better performances, in my humble opinion, but also cheaper purchases), I would tend to steer people away from this release. Instead, I would recommend ""Dick's Picks Volume 9,"" a 3-CD set from 9/16/90, Madison Square Garden ($22 including postage through 1-800-CAL-DEAD), or the super-great ""Without a Net,"" which is pretty much a 'best of' Spring '90 run. It is widely available in music stores... and at about $15 for 2 jam-packed discs with no filler, it's a major bargain.Don't get me wrong. ""Dozin'"" is good, but there are other gems available from this era, and we already suffered from 1990 overkill before Dozin' was released."
4,And We Bid You Goodnight should be accesable,THIS BOX SET IS JUST A BRIEF PREVIEW OF WHAT IS WAS LIKE THAT NIGHT AT KNICKERBOCKER ARENA.
1,Ridiculous and misleading,"The title of this item is ""6 packs"". My mistake for assuming that was six multiple packs, and not reading the fine print and asking for an actual count-- the package came, with the price advertised plus the inflated shipping making the price $6, and inside were six (6) individual studs! That's $1 each for an item that should be at most $0.50 each.You can find these far cheaper elsewhere."
5,Love it!,"I love this scale! It's very accurate (just like the doctor's office), and it saves your last weight reading up to 5 different users. The scale is wide which makes it easy to get on and it's easy to read with the big digital numbers. It shows your current weight along with your previous weight so you can see what you lost (or gainned). It's a great easy to use scale! I love it!"
5,Tanita HD351 Digital Scale Review,This is an excellant scale. I would recommend it and buy it again. It can track the weight of 4 different people. It is very easy to use and the set-up is simple- very user friendly.
4,"Great technology, good price, flimsy deck","Bought this scale because I'm a big guy trying to slim down. I needed something that could handle 350-400 lbs, which most scales just don't do. It works like a charm, and has 5 memory locations, so the whole family can use it. My only complaint is that the deck that you stand on is a little flimsy. It seems to be made of plastic, and I can feel it flex under my feet. That sometimes leaves me questioning just how accurate this scale can be, but having been using it for well over a month, it appears that the flex does not affect the accuracy."
4,"Accuracy a plus, but no confidentiality","I totally love this scale for its design -- low to the ground, and very spacious. And it's reliably accurate. The only down side would be the lack of privacy in regards to scale memory. The ability to erase the recorded weight would be a benefit to those who feel their stats are personal. I get around it by weighing a bleach bottle afterwards.Still, it's a great scale and I'd buy it again."
5,Excellent Scale But doesnt like being wet.,It has been a excellent scale.I kept the scale near the shower and the bottom part gets wet sometimes and after I exercise I shower and Weigh myself.Been using it for the last 3 years with no problems. 2 months ago one day started showing -E- in the display.Worried I called the tech support and they asked me to ship it back. But being a not a big fan of shipping back stuff I went to work - I stored it at an angle under the sink so that It would dry. Then I forgot all about it. 4 weeks ago I opened the door under the sink there it is sitting. I switched it on - voila - It works. So far good! :-)
1,Just My Bad Luck,"Tanita HD351 Digital Scale with Memory FunctionI got the scale in a timely manner but it kept reading ""error"" so I contacted the seller in order to exchange it. Unfortunately they were out of stock, so they gladly gave me a refund. I think it was just my bad luck that the one I ordered was a lemon. In a way I'm glad this happened because with this scale, anyone who gets on after you can see what you weigh!"
5,Very Satisfied,"I purchased this scale (last week) and am VERY satisfied with its ease of use, but most of all, this scale is VERY accurate. I did a lot of research over the Internet. Please notice the number of ratings and the high average (4+ stars) of Amazon ratings, on this particular scale. None of the other scales come close to those ratings. I highly recommend this scale to anyone."
1,You can't read it!!,I had to send this scale back because I couldn't read the numbers without a flashlight. Black numbers on a dark background does not make for easy reading. I'm really displeased.
4,I liked it until it died,"This scale is attractive, easy to put away and has five buttons with memory for up to five different users. It worked reliably and accurately until it just died out of the blue. One day it worked, the next day it was dead. I bought it about 4.5 years ago, so it's beyond the warranty period. But for the price, I was hoping it would last longer."
5,Excellent product: simple yet advanced.,"Very light and small. Works with regular batteries and with one simple touch, you can record up to 5 different measures.Excellent for family or for individuals who like to be weighted more than once under different events (or clothing)."
3,Decent but Feels Cheap,"Bought this scale because of the large footprint (can hold my dog, sort of) but immediately as you step on it it feels like cheap thin plastic that bends and might break. The color of the scale seems to be a yellowish white rather than the bright white the company shows. In short, it is not pretty (would fit right in with that 80's bathroom) and feels cheap, but seems mostly accurate and can store the last 5 weighs."
3,Good but other shows better,"An excellent Doin' that Rag and some good moments but in my opinion this show lacks the inspiration of some other '69 shows (Miami Pop Festival, for example). Solid but unispired. P.S. Cosmic Charlie at the end of the album is the strongest I've ever heard, but unfortunately it's abbreviated."
5,This CD Rocks!,"I'm still a newbie when it comes to the Grateful Dead but I find myself playing these two cd's the most out of all the Dead I have. On cd 2, DARKSTAR through CAUTION is some of the best live music I have ever heard and cd one has a great version of ""That's It For The Other One"". Most Dead fans I have spoke with think LIVE DEAD has the best version of DARKSTAR, but I have to disagree because this one has more feeling and seems more organized. Also, TURN ON YOUR LOVELIGHT sounds better too. Maybe it's because this was their first big show on the east coast and they had to open for Janis Joplin. This is a must have for Dead fans!"
2,A Bit Disappointing..,"Not as great as ""Live Dead"", so pick that up instead. The Dark Star> St Stephen is much better."
3,Kool Spooky Morrisonesque Medieval Sound,Original and Jim Morrison is back from the dead to sing vocals.A good change of pace from anything out there.
5,Treating clients with personality disorders...,"This is a great book! It has a lot of practical information on how to approach treatment for a client who has a personality disorder. Included are case examples and problems that a therapist may have in treating clients. Additionally, the book includes specific intervention strategies and recommendations on how to develop a good working relationship. This is especially important, because a client's interpersonal problems will be played out during session with the therapist. I have used the information in this book to anticipate and prepare for specific issues that have arisen in session."
4,Classic cognitive therapy,Beck and his group have written a classic in cognitive therapy with clear conceptulization of personality disorders. This is a difficult population to treat and Beck's work is clear and on target. Clincal examples enrich the theory making it an essential reference.
1,Beware buying this from Amazon,"Beware buying this item from Amazon. I ordered it and did not receive the right product. After they confirmed that they sent the wrong one (after much fanfare and arguing) they said they would ship the right one. I waited half a month only to recieve an email saying my order was cancelled because they didn't have it. I am using this for my business and they made me lose a lot of time. As a side note, I ordered elsewhere and got the product in 2 days, the scanner itself is top notch, Amazon on the other hand is bottom of the rung in my book."
5,Fantastic,"This machine is great. I've been SLOWLY scanning my old photos for years now. It is a tedious boring project that is no fun at all. Until I got this item, being able to put items of 4X6 or smaller in groups of 24 prints at a time is so great. It changed the slow tedious project into a smooth and quick process!! The scans are great and I can now finally finish my project in a fraction of the time!!If you have tons of old photos you've been wanting to scan but dispaired of the time it would take to do it GET THIS SCANNER!"
1,Connectivity problem,"Buried in the Trouble Shooting guide is an advisory that the 2480 may have problems talking to your computer if you run Windows XP. Epson refers you to a patch in the CD if you recieve connectivity error messages. I loaded the patch and the scanner still locked up. Based on the number of rave reviews, I'd guess that this is an infrequent problem. But if it hits you take the thing back before you pull your hair out."
4,Better than the HP 5500C!,I own the HP 5500C and it's been a pain since day one. It jams on nearly every photo. So far I haven't had a single jam from the EPSON. It's mechanism is more solid than the HP and it autodetects and crops the photos correctly unlike the HP. I've owned/used nearly every major brand of scanner out there. The only drawback is that even in automatic mode the scanner prescans the photo and the scans are slower than the HP...but that's the price you pay for having them cropped correctly. Since this item isn't made anymore I would get the new EPSON 3590 and order the photo feeder as an accessory. This gives you automatic film feeding as well as automatic photo feeding. The downside is that they want as much for the photo feeder as they do the scanner.....so buy both. I would give this 5 stars if is scanned a little faster and if it was packaged with the automatic film feeder as well. The included film/slide adapter does do well though.
4,Sondheim has a stroke of genius,"The lyrics and musical score of Sondheim is pure elegance. His decadent style reaches a creative ""stroke"" of shear brilliance. To put it simply this peice of music encompasses the time , the mood, and the mindset of Sondheim."
4,Review of the Revell P-47D Bubbletop,"The best way to sum this up is that this kit is a great place to start with a 1/32 scale T-bolt. The kit is large enough to add virtually any scratchbuilt detail you can think of and the kit itself is fairly accurate. The biggest drawback is the kits landing gear and lack of detail in the tail-wheel, the gear will need to be beefed up a bit. If you are building right out of the box, it's a fairly fast build. If you are adding detail, the kit has raised panel lines so get a lot of sandpaper if you plan to re-scribe them! Overall, I love the kit. I have built 3 in total, one gear-up/panels closed. The other, wheels down/one panel open. The other one in a work in progress, I am going to open the engine up, gun bays, control surfaces...everything! We'll see how that goes!Anyway, it's a great kit that you can do virtually anything to! I highly recomment this to a novice, intermediate modeler!"
5,A wonderful book,"This book came into my life at the right time. A wonderful evocative book that reflected my own experiences with family dementia. I loved the book and could not put it down, not only for the realism but also for the elegant writing. The authors love and concern for her mother showed. The effect on close relationships also well covered."
5,Powerful!,"I bought this book because I had to for a Psycology class report. I read this in 1 day and was pulled in by the true, raw emotion described in this real story about the author and her mother. It is the kind of book you want to read about a subject you want to look away from. I recommend this for anyone who has a loved one suffering with Alzheimers, in the medical feild, or just someone who wants a gripping, powerful read.p.s. I bought this book used.....wonderful condition...used is the way to go for any college student! low $$$$"
5,I highly recommend this book.,"This is an extremely well-written, highly engaging book. I picked it up with the intention of only glancing through it, but I got hooked almost immediately. It is a tale not only of a daughter dealing with the terrible strain of a mother with Alzheimer's, it is a tale of a fascinating life (the mother's)that was lost to the disease. This is a realistic account of life with Alzheimer's disease. It is not pretty, but it will prepare you for what to expect and help you to avoid possible pitfalls. I would highly recommend this book to any reader, even if Alzheimer's disease is not on your personal radar screen. This book is a really terrific read."
4,A Cautionary Memoir,"I have read Death in Slow Motion, and found it a provocative insight not only into Alzheimer's but more so into its effects on the lives of the people bound by love and duty to their loved one. Ms. Cooney has every reason to dwell on who her mother was, it is after all the central tragedy of the illness. Alzheimer's does not just kill someone, it disintegrates, it degenerates the very essence of the persona you know and love. We do not grieve for the loss of a body, we grieve over the loss of a person and with Alzheimer's we lose the person long before the body they inhabit dies. It is not only Death in Slow Motion, it is also Grief in Slow Motion. I recommend this book to anyone who may be facing a loved one's descent into Alzheimer's or to anyone who thought they were alone with the experience Ms. Cooney so unsparingly reveals. I recommend a visit to the book's website for a more personal insight into the lives involved with this loss."
4,Edición imperdible,Los cantantes no son buenos en general. Pero la grabación es escencial como material de consulta.
2,Not gonna last long,"I've owned three because I really like the look and feel of them, but the band on all three broke within three months. Their packaging promotes a one-year warranty, but I've emailed Hogwild and also gone ahead and just sent the watches back to them (two months ago) and have never heard a peep. I wore them all the time, and they are waterproof, but even though I never stressed the bands by taking them off and on often, all three broke within 90 days."
4,person receiving liked the aroma but it may not last long,I gave it to a relative who liked the smell as it smelled as they would expect and/or would want it to. However the aroma may not last as long as a product costing more. I think it's still a bargain.
3,um..no,"After a year of using Egyptian Musk, I really fell in love with the stuff, but I don't know whatthese people did to it. The oil does not smell like what I bought at the mall last year at the Egyptian store. It smells like a teacher who just drank coffee and some type of bread. I don't think it smells that hot. I should try getting my money back, but then the price hit me. Last time I paid $15.00 for something that smells really good, and this time I paid like $2.00 for something that doesn't even smell like Egyptian Musk. So I guess by the price I'll give this a 3 and the packing was very bad also. It was balled up and trashy looking."
2,Doesn't smell like Egyptian Musk,Great and on time delievery but this product doesn't smell like Egyptian Musk. Don't like the smell :( Really disapointed.
1,Roller bottle?,Love the scent... But it is not in a roller bottle. So how are you suppose to put it on? Stick your finger and rub it on? False advertisement!
1,confused on the past,"this book has good scriptures however it has parts in it that are not true. i know barbara monroe personally she's my aunt by blood, however some of the accounts in this book did not actually happen she exaggerated to make people feel like she struggled. it may be how she remembers it but is it the truth(i think not). the man that died was and still is one of my favorite uncles by blood. my uncle did not leave her with burdens of debt. my uncle had insurance that paid off the house and she still had money left over. i think i might need to write a book about the truth. the death of my uncle took the whole family by storm. i was a young child but i remember it like it was yesterday. whenever i get the money or a sponser i will let everyone know what is really the truth because i do not want anyone to think that my uncle did not take care of his family. my uncle worked two jobs when he was alive. i love my aunt and my uncle however the truth needs to be told!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Nice try, no cigar","After a too-short first visit to Key West I was eager to see more, and hoped this book would fill in the gaps. There are some nice images in this collection, but most have the look of ordinary tourist snapshots. I can't imagine why, for instance, the really boring photo of empty bocce courts was included -- and supersized at that! The pix of birds, doorways and signs are nice, but overall I had hoped for a more insightful approach to this fascinating community."
4,"Saved me $2,000 and filled with great advice",When I bought this book I never realized how much advice I would get from it. I saved two thousand dollars when purchasing a home by following this advice and I was able to detect problems that the home inspector I hired didn't even find. My home inspector was very embarrased when I pointed out problems that he didn't detect.
1,Smells fishy,"I rated this book one star without ever reading it or buying as a means of warning everyone looking to buy it. Something smells fishy here. Not only is the author allowed to rate his own book, but other people are also allowed to rate it 5 stars more than once. Furthermore, when one clicks on those people's ""see my other reviews"" tab, we see that their only other reviews are on the other products from this same author.When I research a product on Amazon, it is with the expectation that the reviews and ratings are mostly right, or at least not obviously crooked. I am certainly not buying this book."
1,Ridiculous,"This item I brought came to my house open, no seal @ all, just wasted it a couple of bucks, this is nonsense."
5,Great for Everyone!,"My 6 year old learned how to knit about 6 months ago. She had lost interest a little bit because it ""took too long"" to finish a scarf. Since watching the very entertaining dvd, she has renewed interest and is knitting faster than before.It covers cast on (long tail), knit stitch, purl stitch, picking up a dropped stitch and bind off.The dvd is fun for the whole family to watch and is interactive. It teaches how to knit a ball, step by step, having you knit along and the dvd automatically pauses until you are done with the section and you press play.It also shows how yarn is made from shearing to spinning yarn.I highly recomend this dvd to everyone, regardless of age or knitting experience."
5,Children make the best teachers!,Cuteness Alert! I got this learn to knit video for my student knitting club. It is taught by a 7-year-old boy. He teaches knitting much better than I do. It kind of reminds me of how I learned Spanish from little kids when I was studying abroad in Costa Rica because they had so much more patience with me when I didn't understand. I would recommend it for kids and adults.
1,Horrible DVD,Do not go with this instruction DVD my daughter hated it and it just didn't have the right information for a child to learn knitting.
3,Average book,"This book is basically about Grant's ideals that he learned from his parents. It's a very quick read and if you like Grant Hill, then I would suggest you check this out. If you aren't much of a Grant Hill fan, then don't purchase this."
5,Pure Jerry,This recording captures the spirit of the Jerry Garcia Band and represents the breadth of Jerry's musical tastes and abilities. From Garcia originals to blues to killer Dylan covers every lick is pure Jerry.
2,Unnecessary,"I'm very surprised at all the glowing reviews given to this release. The 1991 Jerry Garcia Band double CD is a classic but this release falls far short of my expectations. Beginners would be wise to start with something else. Of all the wonderful recordings that are available, it sounds as if these selections were made from ""off"" nights. Vocally, Garcia sounds ragged. Even his guitar playing wasn't tops on these performances. This CD rarely finds its way into my stereo and has (thus far) prevented me from taking the risk of purchasing the third installment, ""Shining Star."" GDM will have to do much better than this...which shouldn't be too hard to do."
5,Magic,This Cd has tremendous power and energy. You hear Jerry pouring his heart out. The vocals are rough The guitar playing is out of this world. John Kahn is also the most unheard of bass player ever. His playing along side Jerry is fantastic. Check out Jerry's solos on Think and Tore up Over You. You will be shaking you head in disbelief. This is a treasure and a gift no doubt about it.
5,The Jerry Garcia Band In All Its Glory,"I don't understand how people get off saying that this album is made of bad cuts and sounds like it was recorded in the crowd. Nothing could be farther from the truth, this is sonically better then anything i've ever heard from the dead, altho i love live recordings of the dead. this is something different, a hard rocking little bit of the Jerry Garcia Band. Lots of improvisation, but in a more structured and straight ahead rock sort of way then the usual dead stuff. I can't reccomend this album enough, its grrrrrrrreat!"
4,Title doesn't lie!,"Though not as good at the double CD, there are some gems on this recording. ""Tough Mama"", ""Gemorrah"", ""Cats Under the Stars"", all tasty."
3,Not completely self contained,"The book is intended for use with an instructor- it mentions this in the text. The instruction is a bit ""terse"" but clear. It starts with layout of a 12 bass, 20 key instrument but also contains a bit at the end on the more complex keyboards."
5,Perfect for the beginner.,"Lots of good instruction for the beginner accordion player who is learning on their own. Great songs that are within the beginners level, yet lots of fun."
4,Wonderfully written,"Mike does a wonderful job of conveying to the reader some of the realities that law enforcement officer's and professional security personnel can experience on a daily basis. His stories actually draw you into his realm as if you were right there with him, seeing what he see's, feeling what he feels. If you have never been involved in the law enforcement/security community, this will give you a well written taste of what it is like and help you experience the dramas that unfold each day, both physically and psychologically. His ability to divulge his own feelings shows that cops are in fact people too. His tales of Africa are humorous, gripping and spellbinding. I was able to visualize his environment and it made me wish I had I had taken up his offer to go to Africa a few years ago just to experience the way of life."
5,"An oversized presentation makes for large-size, clear guitar tabs perfect for any guitar player's music library","ULTIMATE SANTANA offers would-be Santana-style guitar players a fine guitar tab edition of his music, covering all his major works from Oye Como Va to Black magic Woman and She's Not There. An oversized presentation makes for large-size, clear guitar tabs perfect for any guitar player's music library."
5,Choices Made,"""Little Miss No Name"" touched my heart to the very core. Ms. Middlestadt tells the story of this child-teen-adult and the many struggles she must live with.I.E. Child abuse,Neglect,Unacceptance within her own family unit.Though the book is a sad look at what actually occurs in reality, it does well to teach us the reader what it is like to live through the ordeals that Lucy has.All she has ever required of herself was love and someone to accept her. What she finds is that she must look within herself to find her own power. She then is able to find the love she has needed. I shed tears for this forgotton child. The courage and determination spills forth in this remarkable book, and I found myself unable to put the book down. I needed- No,"" I HAD"" to know everything that Lucy was thinking and feeling.This is a highly recommended read!!"
1,"No zeros allowed? Aw, shucks.","They showed ""Baby"" to us every year when I was in summer day camp (Packer Collegiate in Brooklyn for those in the know) and to this day I recall it as the worst movie I've ever seen. I think you would have to do a ""Clockwork Orange"" and mechanically maintain my alertness in order to make me watch this again: you would not, however, have to inject me with evil drugs in order to get me to collapse writhing upon mention of it."
1,No zero star choice,"The lowest I could give is a 1!! I feel sorry for those people who can not get over child memories to fully grasp Jurassic Park or maybe haven't seen some of the greatest dinosaur movies : Jurassic Park trilogy, The Lost World (1925), and The Valley of Gwangi."
1,"Baby, Secret of The Lost Legend","While this might have been a cute movie, just for fun, family kind of show, it fell flat on its dino bones when within the first 20 minutes they used the Lord's name in vain twice and referred to a woman as a female dog, etc. Another movie bites the dust via language. I saw this movie on TV years ago and it was silly and cute but sensored apparently, so I thought I'd buy the DVD. Little did I know. Don't buy it for your kids unless you want your kids to be trash mouths."
2,not for the very young,"Lots of fun moments for kids who love dinosaurs.BUT -- kids today recognize the outdated, unrealistic-looking dino construction; lots of unnecessary shooting and dying (1 dino dies); a couple plain utterances of the word B*TCH; lots of unnecessary, almost gratuitous naked African natives (female upper body); not to mention so-so acting and script and plot.Only for older kids who absolutely LOVE dinosaurs and *must* see more dinosaur movies."
1,UUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH,"I saw this once when I was little. I cried because of the sencless animal violence. I tried watching it last week again. I didn't cry this time, but I still hate it. I mean: who woulda thought that its possible to get so emmotional over fake looking dinosaurs??? Yea, VERY fake. Not to mention the rating. More like PG-13 or R for that matter. Lotsa swearing, violence, and naked ugly tribal chicks. The only funny line in this entire piece of @#$% is when the guy tells his airplane driver about his wife. When he says ""What would you do?"" The hippie airplane pilot says ""Personally, I'd whip the b**ch."" Ha ha. Funny. Almost. I never even finished this movie."
3,An almost sci fi movie,"In the deepest jungle new animals are still being discovered,but not dinosaurs.Sean Young is very fetching in this movie, butit is just pretty much a comedy rompwith very little science involved.You just can't miss a brontosaurusby accident?I liked the movie anyway.They missed out on not making it a kids movie:one loving kid with baby as a pet would have made it at the box office."
3,Childhood memories,"I loved this movie when I was a kid and I still find it entertaining, but kids nowadays may be disappointed by the lack of Jurassic Park quality (and better) special effects."
1,Stupid Movie,All I can say is this movie is not worth what I paid for it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am very disappointed.
4,Recently unearthed!,"I saw this years ago as a kid, mind you a g-rated version of it. I've always had a love of dinosaurs as a child and this movie reinforced that back when I saw it in school. The old fashioned visual effects and practical effects work is pretty decent upon my most recent viewing and my young viewers did not seem to mind.But be warned:I put this movie on for my sisters kids while I prepped some snacks for them in the kitchen. I hear giggling coming from the living room and low and behold I walk into the living room to see topless large breasted African indigenous tribal women. I was not expecting that and I fast forwarded the scene completely red faced while the kids howled with laughter. Still, I think there was hardly anything wrong with it. These kids watch discovery channel and they occasionally see nudity on Bear Gryllis and so on featuring tribal peoples around the world. It made for a funny story though."
4,Baby twin,"So instead of getting what i had paid for, i got a dvd with two movies on it on this ""blank"" two side type dvd. Needless to say, i don`t care too much about those halfbreed type dvd`s. The other movie was ""camp nowhere"" Had i known this i would not have bought the item :-( Not gonna make any comments on the movie itself here."
3,Studio blunder,"Releasing a double album after each of her tour has become a tradition (and a nice way to cash in) and while the first two were wonderful evidence of their respective tours, this newer one is a disappointment. Although the song choices are all together good, the recording (or mixing) is bland and colorless. The drums and guitars have been purposely toned down to give the album a more new-age feel and on the more rhythmic tracks (Optimistique-Moi, Beyond My Control, Dessine-moi un mouton) it just kills. The ballads are breathtaking though, with highlights being the nihilist 'Il n'y a pas d'ailleurs', the heart-breaking 'Dernier sourire' and the show ender 'Innamoramento'. Too much studio touch-ups for a live album that is this expensive and anticipated."
4,Another wonderful Mylene's live record...,"This album is unique like almost all Mylene's work but - sorry to say that - a little worse than her previous concert album ""Live a Bercy"". The quality of sound this time is average and Mylene's voice is sometimes almost missed. But after all the concept of show and realisation are brilliant and Mylene once again proved that she deserves the title of a French pop star number one! I recommend this album and most of all his VHS and DVD version."
1,Don't bother,"We gave it our best shot. So did their techs during a phone call and two emails. They thought my Anti-virus sofware was to blame.The problems I encountered have to do with network permissions, not anti-virus software. I called Dell and McAffee and niether knew of a fix. I have a stand-alone computer, I am the administrator. Between my wife and I, we have over 55 years in PC and mainframe computing experience. They weren't helpful, the software is full of pitfalls and need to be re-configured to allow for a ""dumbed-down"" approach to the simple task of copying files to an external drive. ""out of the box instructions do not require that anti-virus software be turned off, nor that the destination drive be set for NTFS file config. Both were offered as helpful suggestins, but neither worked.Sorry, but for the average user, we can't recommend Novabackup, nor your customer service capabilities. During two three hour attempts, Novabackup didn't even get past the ""write"" stage."
1,"Never worked, had to return","Although the Nova tech support worked with me for over two weeks, posting emails back and forth, I was never able to get the software to function as advertised. I finally had to return the software. I will give the Amazon return procedure 5 stars, however."
1,Seiko Sportura Kinetic Chronograph,"Looks interesting, but why does Seiko limit the stopwatch mode to only 45 minutes? That makes it next to useless in timing runs, hikes and Nordic walks. Could get better functionality in that respect with a watch 1/10 the price of this one."
3,What a watch!,This watch is REAL DAMN big.If you have little wrists dont waste your money to look foolish.
2,Didn't stick very well,I used this product since VHT was out of stock. It didn't stick to my trim pieces...tearing right off after taping for a two-tone door panel. I had problems with mottling as well. I didn't by the adhesion promoter as the can says it is not required. Perhaps it would work better with that product. I would recommend VHT vinyl paint over this product.
3,Decent product.,It works well on carpet although I am inclined to believe it is not much different than ordinary spray paint. It is definitely in no way a dye as application to any vinyl surface is a coating and in no way absorbed into the product. Very easily scratched. I would recommend it for use on carpet and fabric due to the lower price but for vinyl surfaced or anything needing a true penetrating dye I would suggest the VHT product line.
1,Paint wasn't permanent,I bought this for my shoes which is made of fabric on the bottom half....I sprayed my shoes and wore them twice and the paint faded off of my shoe....I though that this product would be permanent and not temporary.
2,"""Minor Works"" is more like it","Both Amazon and Brilliant Classics' own site neglect to specify the contents. Most instrumental works are here (except keyboard suites) but of over 20 English oratorios, the crown of Handel's work, only 3 (Messiah, Jephtha, and Belshazzar - the last sung in German!)and of 44 Italian operas only 3 (Imeneo, Faramondo, and Rinaldo). More than half the CDs have less than 60 minutes of music, and there are no texts for the 25 CDs of vocal music. Performers, mostly obscure, are identified by name only, no background information. Final six CDs are the Complete Chamber Music, available in a separate box set from Brilliant."
3,Disappointing,"Compared to the the other Brilliant 40 cd boxes this is a let down. A lot of minor works in serviceable recordings mostly. The chamber music is good, as are a few stray bits here and there. The orchestral music is well played and well recorded but on modern instruments."
4,Nice Patches,This is actually one of the nicest patches I've found anywhere. They're nice and thick and well stitched. I think they'll hold up well.
4,An astonishing way of looking at all aspects of life,"Fowles analyses and gives his very educated opinion on all aspects of life, from religion to sex, from education, to philosophy and politics.It is a must for all who want to know how the author of ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" sees the world."
4,A REALLY GREAT CONTRACTS HORNBOOK ..,"This is a really great COntracts Hornbook - Farnsworth lays out headnotes/topic sentences in the margins which narrate the particular paragraph/sub-issue you are reading - which assists one in building their outline - IE use the headnotes as one-line topic summary. HOWEVER< I ratd this a ""4"" because Farnsworth has dropped several of the older classic contract cases for newer - more current cases - therefore - to be REALLY complete - I would get the older edition Farnsworth Contracts as well ( so you are covered with all the casebook cases ) - they can be had for $5.00 - $10.00 just about anywhere. I had mine listed on AMAZON, but have withdrawn it because of this little issue - I use them both - the differences are pretty minor as far as the theory. Actually, the earlier editions is a lighter read - the footnote info of the later edition - are paragraphs in the earlier editions.."
2,Farnsworth....,"My contracts professor worships this guy and assigns regular readings from this text. I really don't understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I find Farnsworth's style to be horribly boring and his explanations, while excellent, are much more easily obtained from other sources. For example, the E&E for contracts touches on most of the same concepts (albeit in less detail) as Farnsworth, in a much more readable and understandable format. Chemerinsky's ""ship book"" is also an excellent supplement. For diehard contracts junkies, Farnsworth probably rocks, but if you're just looking to understand the information and do well in class, I would go with some other book."
3,Decent at best,"This particular study guide is marginally helpful. I personally was in a situation where my professor wrote our contracts text, and he recommended Farnsworth. The text is decent as far as understanding and set-up, but in my opinion, there are better study guides out there. The contracts edition of the examples and explanations series is one of them."
1,"""Contract's""??","If the author's misuse of the apostrophe in the title is any indication of how they wrote the rest of the book, I would stay away."
5,Spectacular Video,Spectactular footage with great audio & video quality of two legends.Enough said...the video speaks for itself.
1,Too small to be enjoyable,"The pictures on these Christmas Cards are indeed by Norman Rockwell, but alas, they have been made so small that most of their details, and alot of their charm has been lost. For some incomprehensible reason the designer greatly reduced the size of the Norman Rockwell picture, placed the picture in the center of the card, and then put a VERY broad red margin all around the picture. The pictures could have been made 1/3 larger without changing the size of the card at all, simply by eliminating the margin. It seems like he liked the IDEA of having a Norman Rockwell Christmas card much better than he liked actually HAVING a Norman Rockwell Christmas card."
4,Ride A Rocket - Lithium & Sonya Madan,"US Maxi Single Track Listing for :'RIDE A ROCKET' - LITHIUM & SONYA MADAN1) One Love 7"" Vocal Edit - 3:452) Lithium 7"" Edit - 3:453) Lithium 12"" Vocal Mix - 7:164) Disco Citizens Vocal Remix - 8:061997"
3,Adequate program,"I've been using AutoCAD (full version) since version 9. I bought the LT version for my draftsman to use works fine for what it does, but LT lacks enough of the things the full version does that I won't buy it again.The most important thing I use are lisp routines and LT doesn't support that. That reduces my drafting speed substantially. It also doesn't support 3D. While that's not important to me, I sometimes use it to help see parts of a building to make sure everything works together.Overall, AutoCAD (both full and LT) is a fine program, but they need to keep backwards compatibility. If you can afford $4,000 for the full version, you'd be better off. But if not LT will work in a pinch."
5,auto cad lt 2007,"the only problem is the amount of tutorial, i know you can't write to every level, but the turorial (getting started) for a first timer user was a little diffcult."
4,Why these spoons?,"They're extremely small but seem to work for my 8-year old daughter. Outside of that, I'm not sure they're 100% stainless steel. I've come across some rust marks."
5,9 pin code set for older openers,Works great with my 1987 garage door opener. Be careful when replacing openers as I have bought many that won't work.
4,Good Buy,Good USC Sweatshirt combo for a very good price. Though it doesnt match upto whats sold at the USC book store but its good enough.
5,amazing,If you buy this prepare to love it. It looks amazing on rod it holds a ton of line it is such a good price I couldn`t afford not to get it
3,Short,Product would be excellent if it was about 3 inches longer. or great if you had really short forearms... it works though.
1,disappointed,Ordered to increase my wrist and forearm it was difficult to use and did not seem to concentrate on the parts of my arm I wanted to strengthen
2,Saw little difference in my skin.,"I am 34 and have never had acne before. Now at this stage in life it is a problem. I ordered Klear Action with hope of a cure. However, I have been on it now for 5 weeks and the only thing I can say that is positive about it is that it has evened out my skin color and made my skin glow without make up. with that being said though my acne has NOT improved even a little bit! I think it is actually worse. I am glad it worked for others I was just not one of them!"
2,Just Okay,"After using Proactiv for 6 months, I was told by a friend to try Klear Action, which is supposed work and have the same skin clearing effects of Proactiv but at an inexpensive price. I used Klear Action for about 5 months and noticed that it did not control acne flare ups the way that Proactiv did. The Renewing Cleanser in Klear Action doesn't give the same ""clean"" feeling that the Proactiv brand does. I had constant breakouts on my face all the time. When I used Proactiv I had clear, smooth skin, and NEVER had breakouts. I have decided that cheaper is NOT always the best. I have switched back to Proactiv and I am once again free of blemishes and breakouts."
2,Not very effective for me,"I've been using this brand for the last six months and to be honest, it doesn't do much for my zits. The quality doesn't feel as good as ProActiv, which didn't work wonders for me, either, but at least felt ""expensive"" whereas Klear Action feels like it's all cheap ingredients. You may want to try this out for a month and see if it works."
1,Didn't work long term,"I tried this and it seemed to work for the first week, but after that my acne was back as normal. I continued on trying it for over a month. As with many acne products I find - they seem to go ineffective for me after a short time."
3,Alternative Treatment,I tried the treatment after having used Proactiv a couple of years ago. Somewhat effective at preventing break-outs but doesn't work quite as well as P-activ. For half the price it works as expected. If you are looking for immediate and noticable treatment go with P-activ. Otherwise this product works as expected for the price.
2,Disappointing,"The first few days, I was sure this was a great product. It actually felt good on my skin, I didn't even need to use a moisturizer afterward, which I always do. But after a few weeks, my skin wasn't looking any better, and it was getting really dry. I started applying once a day instead of twice, but it didn't matter, my skin kept getting dry and I kept getting pimples. After five weeks, I had to discontinue use. I'm not sure why it worked so well for the other people here, maybe it was just my skin."
2,"Better than Nothing, but Not as Good as Proactiv, Unfortunately","I tried this product because of price, pure and simple. I just could not afford the Proactiv and was looking for something else. Unfortunately, this system is not as effective as the Proactiv system I was using.The lotion does help with the dryness. The scrub does help with some of the smaller pimples. but overall these products are just okay. They are not as good as Proactiv. This system does not include a mask which is one of the things I like best about Proactiv since it seems to clear up bad pimples very quickly.I think that the system is better than just soap-and-water, but it's not the solution I was looking for. I'm going to try other products, though, because I do think that Proactiv is just too expensive."
3,I like Proactiv better,"I personally like Proactive better. The Proactiv cleanser has a better exfoliant, I think. Plus I noticed results much quicker with Proactiv. But if you're really wanting to save money then I'd say this is the next best thing to Proactiv."
4,It works for me,"I bought this for my daughter who had a serious breakout. It cleared most of her face except for the area in the forehead. It may be that she didn't use it twice a day. She only used it at night. I have occasional break outs especially in the summer. It really works for me. I will give it a 5 star for myself. But for my daughter who is 15 years old, it's not 100% improvement. I would say it improved 85%."
3,"pretty good, but not proactiv","I used Proactiv for a few years before trying Klear Action. I switched because Proactiv was just getting too expensive, and the fact that Klear Action is half the price appealed to me. It is a pretty good system, and my skin is fairly blemish free. I do still get a few here and there and the condition of my skin isn't nearly as good as it was with Proactiv. But because of the price, I'll probably continue to use Klear Action."
4,La mejor de musica espanola,EBS is just as good as the first ella baila sola CD--both have the wonderful mellow-rock sound that's so great. I love Despídete.
3,Disappointing,"After an amazing first CD, I was very disappointed in the follow up. There are a few good songs on it, but overall I found it lacking. I would recommend the first CD to anyone unfamiliar with the group, but you may want to pass on this one."
3,A disappointment..when compared to their 1st CD which I love,"I bought this CD without even hearing a song of it because I loved their first one so much. Anyway, needless to say, I didn't even let the songs finish before checking out the next ones which weren't much better. I have to say they have amazing voices but the lyrics were just not as clever as the ones in the 1st CD. If you loved their first release chances are you are going to be disappointed with this one."
2,Ugh! Orbital's Name used in vain!,"I bought this on the whim that it might be good since Orbital was included in the mix. I can say one positive thing...it IS well mixed, like one continuous, long song. And let me tell you, for the first 6 (count 'em, six) songs, it IS LONG! These first six tunes are absolute trash! It amazes me that someone actually thought they were good enough to be on a mix!Song 7 (Lithium's ""Ride a Rocket"") starts to show some promise, working into a nice groove, only to ebb away near the end of song 8. Songs 9 and 10, again are utter garbage, annoying at best! The album FINALLY gets better in song 11. ...And songs 12 through 14 are fantastic, ending solidly with...you guessed it, a clipped version of Orbital's ""Sinner.""Pass on this one, unless you can pick it up used for under $5 (since only 1/3 of the music is worthwhile)."
3,Not As Good as Book One,"Over the years, I have read a number of the books in this series by Faye Kellerman. I recently read the first book ""The Ritual Bath"" for one of my book groups and loved it. I couldn't wait to read the second book ""Sacred and Profane"" to find out what happens next with the main characters. I found the murder mystery plot more interesting in the first book and discovered that I will need to continue reading the series to learn more about Rina and Peter's relationship."
3,Sacred and Profane,"This was a good tight mystery story with relatively few digressions into the private lives of the detectives, and I very much prefer mysteries of that type. It made me want to read more of her books, and I have long been a reader of her husband."
5,A good book done wrong,"As always, this Faye Kellerman was excellent. What would have made it better was that I had not already read it. I read the excerpt but it didn't sound totally familiar, so I bought it. Evidently my pleas to put the copyright date on the listing for the books fall on deaf ears. There goes my book budget for this month!"
3,A good story but not great,I was a bit disappointed by the story. I was led to believe that it would be a real page turner but didn't find it so. A lot of inside info into what it is to be an orthodox jew but otherwise I was not awed.
2,not a real sequel,"i was disappointed in this novel, because i really wanted to read more about the main characters and the balance of their very different lives as they came together....but it was mostly a mystery novel, and not one i particularly enjoyed. i guess the author gave it her all in the first book, ""the ritual bath"" as far as being a fantastic view into the ethnicity of the people involved."
5,She never fails to deliver a great book.,What can I say? I'm a fan. You won't be disappointed in this one. I can't say you'd be disappointed in any of them.
4,Intriguing mystery,"Sacred and Profane is the second in the Rina Lazarus/Peter Decker Mystery Series. In this installment Peter is camping with Rina's sons when they discover human remains which have been burned. Peter begins an investigation to determine the identity of the remains and ends up in the profane world of porno film-makers. The word ""sacred"" in the title refers to Peter's study of Judaism which Rina requires of him if their relationship is to progress to marriage. Peter begins to chafe at the restrictions of Rina's Orthodox faith, which leads to a crisis in their relationship. Kellerman, as always, does a skillful job of weaving a murder mystery into the background of Peter and Rina's private life. This talented writer can always be depended on to provide a good read."
1,"Regurgitated from Vol. I, plus new garbage=Waste of Money","There are the modern P.U.A. (Pick Up Artists) who actually take you out in the field and show you how it's done successfully, then there's R.Don Steele.... R.Don Steele liberally borrows from other books. Notably, A Man's Guide To Women, by T.C. Knudesen and John Hempstead, and No Excuse! I'm Doing It, by Jay Rifenbary. Save your money and get far superior advice by buying those books instead!"
1,"Grandpa Goes Ga-Ga, Gets Girl-Goofy","Thirty years ago psychologists determined a women makes up her mind about whether to date a man within one minute or so of meeting him. The 62-year-old author, real name John White, clings to a totally outdated view that a man should place himself briefly in front of a desired potential dating partner several times before asking her out. John White (the author) announced himself in Jan. 2002 that his young wife is divorcing him (his 3rd divorce). Radio talk show host Tom Leykis gives much better, up-to-date dating advice freely on his show. Don't waste your $$$ on any of this elderly guy's books."
1,Cut and Pasted Crud,"I recommend the first book but this follow up was very bad. It is like a lot of cut and pasted internet letters to and from the author. The structure is bad and you have to go through a lot of crud to pick up relevant points (most of which have been covered in the first book). The subject itself is great yet the material leans towards being a bit general and somewhat outdated. I would recommend Volume I, as well as The Art of Seduction, Mystery Method, as well any material from Steele's nemesis Ross Jefferies."
1,"Ugh! Outdated Concepts, Needs to be Rewritten","Steele, real name John White and also uses pen name of Jane Thomas, writes like what he is: a twice-divorced guy almost 60 years old. Much of this book are stories about dating life that is of little help in today's dating scene. White/Steele/Thomas (all the same guy) had one interesting chapter in Vol. One of this series, it was about ""the right attitude"" and holding off on the flowers, gifts and compliments by remaining friendly but slightly aloof. The rest of his advice is outdated and might have worked when Carter was president. Any halfway decent English college major could spend a few hours improving this sloppily produced book and make it much more readable."
5,"Steele is ""Right On""","After my marriage of 16 years ended, I had no clue on how to date any woman, not just a young woman. Steele delivers his message in a clear, concise and logical approach that helps all men find, date and maintain a mutually satisfying relationship with the girl of his dreams. Not only has Don helped me tremendously in dating women in general, he has forced me to remember what is to be and act like a man. ""Advanced Skills"" along with Volume One and his book, Body Language Secrets is the best book series on the planet, hands down! After you read these books, check Don out at Live 365, an internet based talk show."
4,Practice Makes Perfect,"This book gives you a down-to-earth, straight-talking' approach to how to date young woman. In order for this book to work you half to study and reread all the principals that are written. Another good book to read is How to date young woman for men over 35 (volume1). by R. Don Steele. Reading this book has opened my eyes to almost a new world. For any man who is sick of the games and wants to be happy you need to read these books."
1,Grandpa Goes Gunnin' for the Young Ones!,"This elderly author has made a cottage industry out of a very limited number of observations about the dating scene. Most of his few worthy points are lifted out of ""A Man's Guide to Women"", which he did not write. Curiously, for all his preaching about being a man, this guy writes under the phony name of R. Don Steele. And he points out late in the book that even he has met with limited success using his strategies and that the young women he does nab dated him usually less than a year. Volume 2 is just a continuation of Vol. 1, no new tips or strategies. His books are surprisingly crude, even considering he is self-published, reading them is like swimming in cement. Combined with his controversial online behavior, the author continously displays a dominating demeanor which wouldn't work on an educated or emotionally healthy young woman. Just about any other relationship work available here would be better than this waste of time and money."
2,Only one part of track,"The book gets two stars for its advice on dress, body language and ""right attitude"". All useful advice, but I think most men figured out the right attitude during high school. If you are both attracted to each other, the less contact the more the attraction grows. It's the old absence makes the heart fonder maxim. Not much of a revelation there.Where this book fails the worst is the assumption that sex is the main need of males and females after air, water, and food. If that were correct, then the author would not be three times divorced. If you are looking for a book on one night stands or limited relationships for a few months or years, then this book is for you. If you are looking for advice on a lasting relationship based on spirituality, commitment, and unconditional love, then look elsewhere."
5,Another volume of pure genius,The material in this book is a priceless follow-up to volume 1. Buy them both. Have them shipped overnight. Volume one lays down the theory. Volume 2 builds on the theory and makes it come alive with many real-life examples from actual readers - readers who are SUCCEEDING with young women.
1,Short and lacking the fine details of true psychology,"This book categorizes people into far too simplistic categories. In a church environment I could see how this book could be useful, however, this book is lacking in general strategic communication skills that are imperative to have in real life. It doesn't take into account that not everyone stays the same forever, people change. It forgets that in the real world, people are more complex, versatile creatures. If you're looking for a communication book, I recommend ""Difficult Conversations"". ""How to get along with Difficult People"" is redneck psychology and minimal thought put into the writing process. Please don't waste your time."
1,Trite and ignorant-Christian ignorance of the worst possible kind,"This book only contains a few personality types and references everything on how you would deal with people at Church!It is trite and ignorant enough to make me wonder how this person can possibly view themselves as an authority, or how this book got published. My guess is its her 6th or 7th book and they gave it to her cause she sells books. This is most likely her first venture on this particular subject. Her views of depression and depressed people are particularly offensive."
3,"Comprehensive, but common","I have to admit that with the price I had to pay for this book and the amount of 5 star reviews it was receiving, I expected something much, much better. Although this book does contain a lot of information about various magical techniques I feel that it lacks depth. Also, as an herbalist, I am annoyed that it contains a large section of herb lore, but does not list botanical names for individual herbs. If you are buying this book because it proclaims information on pyschoactive plants, don't. This section is lousy. The herbal section has several problems, besides the lack of botanical nomenclature, it also has pieces of information missing concerning dosage in dealing with a highly poisonous plant.There is useful information here, but it is just another's BOS, and I find that this all too common that people are publishing their BOS's without the well researched depth to go with it.Peace."
4,Good Album From A Great Talent,So not many people have heard of this talented musician well read all th Robert Plant labels and you will find his name there. This is the first of his solo albums after many years touring and recording with Plant. The songs are all great with a good variety of Tempo. My Fav Tracks are The Stealer & Judgement Day. This CD might be a bit to much blues for some but if you are a fan of good blues rock check it out it is well worth a listen.
5,Voivod's best,"Amazing record, Killing Technology the previous album is also great, but this one is even better. Check out Die Kreuzen's October file album if you want to see where this amazing sound comes from. Voivod incorporated Die Kreuzen's sound, their own sci fi themes and complex song structures into a thrash metal masterpiece."
2,Great riffs / Bad vocals,"This is good technical heavy metal songs, full of great riffs and good lyrics, with vocals that make the whole record almost unlistenable. The artwork is awful.I recommend anything from Coroner instead of this record."
5,Absolutely one of the greatest metal albums ever,"Montreal's Voivod were Canada's answer to Metallica and one of the titans of the thrash panteon standing along side Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax.This concept album, with it's Metal Hurlant imagery and it's shredding speedmetal, is intelligent, complex without seeming pretentious and the soundtrack to some amazing sci-fi novel never written. The album art done by Drummer Away is also worth the purchase with pictures for each song.Best tracks: tribal convictions, brain scan"
5,Great Product!,"This is a great recorder. The only down side is the headphone plug is a 2.5 mm instead of 3.5 mm. Which some made into a big deal, but it really isn't. It is very sturdy. It has great sound quality and picks up a lot of sound for being very small. I would recommend it to everyone if they need something simple. Works great and am glad I bought it. Also, the seller shipped very fast. I got it in about 3 business days. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the following Wednesday. I was really surprised. Great experience."
3,No Earphones,"This microcassette recorder might be good for recording purposes, but I am a medical transcriptionist and use a hand-held recorder at times to review my work before sending it back to the physician. I bought this unit a week or so ago to replacee one I had had for years. When I went to use it tonight and went to plug my earphones in, which I had been able to use on my previous hand-held unit, I found that they didn't fit. My earphones have always fit these hand-held units, as well as my desk transcribers. If they changed the connector on the unit to fit different earphones, they should have included earphones in the package. If you are a transcriber and are interested in hearing every detail on the tape, you won't be able to without earphones."
1,QUESTION FOR THOSE FAMILIAR WITH OLYMPUS PEARLCORDER S702,"I purchased the S702, and then read that the S701 is identical except for the color. True? Is there any difference in the features, specs, or construction? If not, I was ripped off having spent close to $70 for a recorder that I could get for $25. Any feedback is appreciated."
4,Very Entertaining Selection of Country Artists!,"This sure is an interesting cross-section of Country singers! I've seen some of the early footage before, like Johnny Cash and Eddy Arnold from the Fifties, but the color stuff from the Sixties and Seventies was really something, like Buck Owens, Kenny Rogers, and the Oak Ridge Boys. I'm glad somebody had the foresight to save some of those TV performaces!"
1,I'm Sick of Jazz Lightweights,Rotten stuff. To think of all the GOOD musicians who have died penniless...
1,Brainless,"All of Kenny G's music is the same. Always the same ""easy listening"" and ""relaxing"" music on CD after CD. I find his music mind numbing and boring. This is probably his best CD and it is still a yawner."
1,Don't you dare call it jazz!,"A quick lesson: Kenny G is NOT a jazz musician by any means. The music he plays is not jazz. He plays a saxaphone-that does not make it jazz! If you think this is what jazz is all about, wake-up! Jazz is a form of expression and state of mind that achieves levels of emotion much more complex than ol' Ken could ever hope to blow out of his horn. If you want to hear jazz, pick up a Miles Davis record. If you want to hear homogenized, non-music full of hot air, listen to Kenny G"
4,Melodic harmony from master Kenny G,"When searching for an album with the perfect blend of instrumental classics and hip, on the edge musicianship, you'll never go wrong with the saxophone sultan himself, Kenny G...Breathless is a great attempt at trying cutting edge music formulas basically by himself. Kenny outdoes himself in such tunes as ""Homeland"" and ""By the Time this Night is Over"". Kenny's instrumentals of ""Sentimental"" and ""The Joy of Life"" will flat out knock your socks off. His musical wizardry and brute talent shows itself throughout Breathless. You'll love Kenny on his masterous sax as he can easily either bring down the house with his incredible volume or rock a baby to sleep with his mellow tones of saxophone harmony. You can't go wrong with Breathless by Kenny G."
1,It doesn't matter whether this is jazz or not.,"Music genres are just names which help contextualize music in certain traditions; they do not constitute value judgements. Just because a musician is a ""real"" Jazz musician does not mean his music is worth listening to, and just because something is not jazz does not mean it's worthless drivel.But regardless of whether the music he plays is jazz or not, Kenny G's music is hopelessly uninspired and uninteresting. I'm not going to go on bashing Kenny G fans, but if you want soothing, romantic music, I suggest you buy Miles Davis's Kind of Blue or some Stan Getz albums. If you want to listen to acessible jazz music, buy some Billie Holiday or Louis Armstrong albums."
5,He didn't blow it this time - (my joke),"This mellifluous offering from ginger-banged sax-merchant Kenny G easily surpasses his other efforts, such as ""Silhouette,"" ""Kenny G The Moment"" or even the superlative ""Sax Hits of the 90's,"" which to these humble ears was one of the last decade's most minging jazz albums, bar none. The assistance of hotshot producer Adam ""Sweepstakes"" Levine should not be underappreciated; he applies a cavortedly glistening angle to ""By The Night Is Over"", the stunning duet with vocalsmith ""Peabo"" Bryson. Special plaudissimos must also go to Ian ""Jungleberries"" Edgar, who contributes a wonderful Hammond. This album is, in a word, ""utterly unsurpassable."""
3,sweetness with a side of sultry,"A delightful blend of the most soothing music you can buy - only problem - you need someone to share it with. What I'm trying to say is you need a loving companion to get to the heart of the matter - even if, even if, she doesn't love you anymore. So do it right and make sure you have company for the evening! Good luck and best wishes."
5,My Wedding Music,"I walked down the aisle to ""Forever in Love"" instead of the traditional wedding march and used many other songs on the ""tape"" at the time - I bought the Cd so we would have a better copy for our upcoming 12th anniversary - this collection will always be a treasured memory and timeless selections of wonderful romantic and peaceful music. Always treasured, Kenny G"
1,souless,This is trance muzak for those who don't care to hear anything remotely resembling creative art. If you need something to sleep to - highly recommended.
1,Music for the masses,"I've never been able to comprehend the popularity of Kenny G, as well as his label as a ""Jazz Musician"". About the closest association I can make with Kenny G and Jazz is the fact that his mind numbing music is played predominately on a soprano sax. If I had to put a genre on his music, I'd have to lean towards soft rock or easy listening, i.e. the fast food of the music industry. And Kenny-boy is truely the super-sized version of it all.People can call this good music and enjoy it all they want. I'm not going to tell you want you can listen to. But please, please, stop insulting the jazz genre and it's great history by lumping in Kenny G. If you want good jazz go find some Coltrane, Miles Davis, or Charlie Parker for starters. You don't have to be a so-called purist to enjoy the good stuff that's been around."
5,Listen Up!,"First of all in response to all that debate of whether or not he's a jazz musician I have a little to say.1.First type of jazz is the stlye such artists as Miles Davis, Jonn Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock and many more play. The improvisation filled glorious sounds.2. Then there's big band jazz with guys such as Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Duke Ellington and Count Basie specialized in.3. Then guys like Brian Setzer and Big Voodoo Daddy who combines rock with jazz.4.And then there's mainstream/popular smooth jazz, in which Kenny G specializes in. So whatever styles of jazz u like keep with them, but don't say Kenny G isn't a Jazz man."
5,Beautiful,"I do not like everything Kenny G makes, but I thought this album was the bomb!! I enjoyed it with my boyfriend, and he thought it was nice also."
4,"It's jazz, it's not jazz, enough already - it's a good album","This is not a debate as to whether Kenny G plays jazz or not. Personally, I don't classify this album as jazz. But for some nice romantic background music, this CD can't be beat. It is ideal for a candlelight dinner or similar occasion.Ignore the 3.5 star rating, by the way. Most people seem to think that you rate this album based on how legitimate a jazz star Kenny G is. If he's jazz, it gets five stars, if he's not jazz, it gets one star. That's not what this rating system is about, people. If you don't like Kenny G, why are you even reading this?"
3,Breathless,"music is good, but CD quality is not, The Cd won't work start track 11, won't has music, but make terrible noise"
4,Very durable tray,"I purchased this when I was pregnant so my husband could feed me. It is a very durable tray and I would recommend it. Nice ""side pockets"" to keep stuff in."
2,not really intended for wider laptops,"My hubby bought this for me for much cheaper than this listed as a temporary lap table for use in bed and the couch. Although the spaces on the sides are nice the table top is indented and if your laptop is the wider kind it will not ""fit"" and slide. If you use this in bed careful if you move around (changing position ect) cause it gets off balance and falls backward. (note the legs are narrowed). Based off this one I am looking for one that is wider, has a wider leg stance. This would be GREAT for kids !!!"
5,review of race traitors,"An extremely exciting and suspenseful novel. This book has it all: tension, complex characters, sex, violence, and a moving plot. What really makes this book stand out is the way it is guided by music--Jazz music. The infusion of jazz, which becomes a character itself, is a delightful force in the book. Davis' insights into police procedures seem genuine and authentic--as does his understanding and explanations of gang life. Moreover, his development of the characters' battle with morality and justice--of being true to their people while being officers of the law--make this an experience where you'll find yourself rereading pages. All of this is coupled with Davis' obvious flare for humor and dead-on Chicago lingo. At times, the book serves as a history map of Chicago's South Side and its people. This was a really enjoyable book. I can't wait to read the next one. I look forward to this author becoming a mainstay in this genre."
4,A good compilation,"Duran Duran's ""Greatest"" features a variety of famous hits and lesser known (but still impressive) tracks. ""The Reflex,"" ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and ""Rio"" are among the stand out songs here, but the album begins to sag in the middle. The biggest problem with this compilation, however good already, is the track selection. A stronger ""Greatest"" would have been acheived without unimpressive songs like ""Wild Boys,"" ""Girls on Film,"" and ""Serious"" while some very good songs from the thier 1997 album, Medazzaland, are missing.Overall, anyone interested in knowing about Duran Duran's sound would do well to begin with ""Greatest""."
4,"Big hair, Big Sound","It's 1982. You normally use an entire can of hair spray each time you go out and the sleeves of your jacket are rolled up to your elbows. Playing extremely loudly in the background is ""Hungry like the wolf"". When I bought my first CD player, I set about replacing my vinyl collection, starting with my favorite albums first. ""Rio"" was first on the list. Taking the best of Rio and adding the best of the rest of Duran Duran's efforts can only be a winner."
4,"Good, but where the hell is ""Violence of Summer""?","I am glad the album starts with their best song, ""Is There Something I Should Know?"", first of all. The long album version of ""Skin Trade"" should have been included since it features a great horn solo that most people don't know exists. ""Violence of Summer"" was such a cool, carnival-like tune that was slighted on the radio then and wasn't included here, although it at least charted... did ""Serious"" ever chart? Since this seems to be a Greatest hits album, I don't get that, although I like ""Serious"". I agree that they need to have an album that features other killer tunes not played on radio, like ""careless Memories,"" ""Friends of Mine,"" ""Tel Aviv,"" ""Palomino,"" etc., which new fans could buy to whet their appetites for more Duran. But this is much better than the chronological format of ""Decade."" Give me more!!!!"
3,A Decent Compilation,"Duran Duran had several hits. Some of which made it on here. If you like the band, I would recomend this compilation.And a note to Cranky Reviewer....To compare Duran Duran (who fit thier ""greatest"" onto one CD) to Bob Dylan (The Voice of a Generation) is just horrid. To dislike a genre of music is your own choice, but I would think twice before you bare your ignorance for all to see"
3,Greatest Repackage,"This is essentially nothing more than a repackaging of the 1998 ""Greatest"" CD and DVD (previously sold separately) into a single package. If you don't have it yet and you really want it, this collection is a good way to get the full package. One note however, the version of this I have seen out in the stores doesn't have the full list of videos on the DVD that the separate package had, so beware. Make sure you are in fact buying what you want and don't get your panties in a bunch if the particular video you wanted isn't on there!"
1,This is SO not right...,"Who was the jagoff at EMI/Capitol that put this compilation together? Half of their greatest are not even on here! Also whowas the moron who BUTCHERED Save A Prayer and Rio? These edits are an insult to the band! ""Greatest"" should have been a double CD; the first disc being tracks from 1981-1985 and the second disc being from 1986-1999. Well, I have vented my 2 cents... bye!"
5,"the wild boy are calling ,and i'm answering!","why do i like duran duran so much? because they made some great music in thr'80s,and continue to make great music today. this collection has a lot of great songs on it.those songs are planet earth,girls on film,is thre something i should know,rio,hungry like the wolf,save a prayer,the reflex,the wild boys,a view to a kill,notorius,,i don't want your love,all she wants is,ordinary world,and come undone. if you like duran duran,you will like this album. also check out the original albums,the power station album, and arcadia's so red the rose. ed wilson"
4,"well, I don't think i've heard better pop music","Basically I bought this cause ""A view to a kill"" was stuck in my head from watching the movie. It was pretty much what I expected, lots of catchy as hell pop/dance tunes. The suprising thing is it isn't crap, like a lot of that kind of music is. Sure Rio and Hungry like the wolf aren't exactly the most substantial songs ever but they stand up as true pop classics cause they are just, well, to damn catchy. Same can be said for Is there something I should know, reflex, girls on film and the erie and terrific Planet Earth. Ordinary World is so much more than that a truley terrific song and Electric Barbarella is a strangley appealing techno dance tune. Problem is, there are too many dumb expirimental songs, like all she wants is and wild boys but as long as there are cool catchy pop masterpieces like a view to a kill that's fine with me."
5,Did I go back in time?,If you grew up with Duran Duran as I did then you really need to have this in your collection.There is a lot of 80's music that doesnt stand the test of time but Duran Duran is an exception. When you listen to the songs on this cd you realize just how great they really were! I can go weeks with this in my cd and love listening to it over and over.This is a great compliation as well spanning almost 20 years of music. Every track on here is a treat for the ears!
3,huh??,"i was just reading crankey reviewers glowing remarks for Duran Duran, and i came upon a shocker. down about midway through he states, ""In 50 years time, do you REALLY think anyone will remember Bob Dylan or Led Zeppelin? Highly unlikely, pal!""in the words of jon steward ""WHA?!?!"" to be honset with everyone, i dont care about duran duran or their 80's pop, but i do take offense at trashing main figures in pop history. Dylan and Zeppelin changed the musical landscape tenfold in comparison to duran duran"
1,never received my cd,"when i made the purchase i was very excited, told my self again duran duran wow nice, but what happened never received my cd..."
1,a frisbee for 14 bucks????,"this piece of crappy plastic can be used as a coaster by your kids or you can use it to rest your beer glass on the table.the music on this stupid album is a real stinker with moronic and pointless songs like notorious and wild boys from these awful talentless new wave dance band who thankfully disbanded fifteen years back.chuck this in your garbage bin right now and i mean now,now,now,now,now.minus 100 stars.avoid"
1,sounds more like the worst,"please dont listen to this awful new wave band from the eighties(one of the worst decades of music).it is cheesy horrible bands like this that had almost destroyed rock music till it was rescued by bands like pearl jam and soundgarden.Songs like girls on film,rio and wild boys sound dated and lousy and you will be well advised to avoid this crappy band who are thankfully defunct.my rating 0/10."
4,This is A Really Good Compilation,"I have to say Duran Duran is among one of the most important bands in the 80s and have contributed lots of great songs. This compilation is a very good compilation with their best songs throughout time. You might remember hits such as The Reflex, Hungry Like a Wolf, Rio, or New Moon On Monday.I think Duran Duran's music is quite good. Lyrically speaking, I am not very sure about how to describe Duran Duran though. Maybe I don't understand the lyrics.The album has a few interesting pics of the band (Not exactly clearly shown) and has the info on the year of the song which I think is quite a good concept. Recommended for both Duranies and non-fans."
5,Forget the Backstreet Boys...give me Duran Duran!,"This CD contains nearly all of Duran Duran's hits of the 80's and 90's. If you were a teenager during the 80's your are going to reconize and love such songs as ""Girls On Film"" and ""View To A Kill"". One of the most played CD in my whole collection."
3,good greatest hits collection,"Though I prefer slightly darker music like Depeche Mode, Tangerine Dream and Surreal Realm....I like alot of the songs on this collection."
5,"Better Than ""Decade""","This album is better than Decade for one song that was excluded, ""New Moon on Monday""! Along with the new songs (Come Undone, Ordinary World), you can not get any more Duran Duran other than A) They come out with more great stuff B) You buy ALL their albums!"
5,excellent compilation from a great band!,"""Greatest"" is a terrific album of classic singles for any 80's fan or pop music fan. The only disappointment is that many singles haven't been included, esp. ""My Own Way"", ""Careless Memories"", ""Violence Of Summer"" and ""White Lines"" just to name a few! Duran Duran are simply one of the best pop/rock bands of the past 20 years and this c.d. is a great testament to that. Some detailed liner notes or at least chart positions of the songs would have been welcome. This music brings back very fond memories of the 80's for me, although i'm only 27! I highly recommend ""Greatest"" to everyone."
3,"Their Greatest? Some of them, yes, but certainly not all...","This is a very good album, but a number of excellent tracks are definitely missing and a few bogus ones have crept on there too, in my opinion."
2,Bastards!!,"I can deal with this album for the most part and I think they picked a fan-worthy ensemble of songs...HOWEVER - why in the hell would you use the cut radio version of songs on a ""Best Of"" CD!?!!!!??? I was pissed. For ""Rio"" and ""Ordinary World"" I ended up having to download them so that I could enjoy the sax solo and extended guitar solo from OW. That pretty much destroyed the album for me, but that's the way it goes, I guess."
3,"Had all my faves but a couple were ""snipped""","Had all the favorites I love and remember, but was very dissappointed by the shortened versions of ""Save A Prayer"" and ""Hungry Like the Wolf"". Yes, us true Durannies know the difference!"
3,Good music - Defective CD,"I would rate this collection as very good, except for some serious reservations regarding the CD quality. In terms of the tunes, the inclusion of shortened radio edits of songs like ""Rio"" is ultimatley balanced out by inclusion of versions of ""The Reflex"" and ""Ordinary World"" that are actually superior to the original album versions. So, no big problems then with the song selection.What is TOTALLY pathetic about this CD is its manufacturing - it only plays correctly thru to the end on certain CD players. I'm on my second copy of it already and it has the exact same problem as the first one did... ""Come Undone"" (the last song) skips so badly on most CD players that it's barely listenable. They cut it way too close in terms of time/data limits on this disc; there is apparently more music on here than a (mass produced) CD is meant to hold - consequently the CD skips. Great music. Crap manufacturing."
4,"Well, it's better than Decade...","If you don't own any Duran Duran CDs and want a good, broad collection of their material, then this is an excellent CD and you can stop reading here. ******** However, if you're a fan, don't bother getting this. What could have been an incredible 2-CD collection was shortened to a single CD joke. Not only were great singles omitted (Careless Memories, My own Way, Too much Information, Violence of Summer, Out of My Mind, and others), but some of the best songs they chose were shortened to keep it on 1 CD. Rio was absolutely defiled, and the single versions of Save a prayer and Ordinary World are weak compared to the album versions. When are they going to finally learn that we want the B-sides released?? Or another live album?? Or at least a REAL Greatest collection?"
2,Decade plus a few new songs,"I'm a loyal Duranie so I'm biased toward the band, but I have to warn the othes: if you already have Decade, Medazzaland and The Wedding Album, stay away from Greatest. It's like Decade, only with two songs each from Medazzaland and TWA. That's not all, though. Songs have been cut for time in order to cram in 19 tracks. I bought it for my car CD player so I don't have to lug a collection around, so it's OK for those Duranies who travel a lot."
4,duran duran,"Im not a big fan but i have this album for the two singles ""ordinary world"" and ""hungry like the wolf"". great songs."
4,Nice intro album,"This disc covers most of Duran Duran's biggest hits, many of which I have been hearing on the radio for years. Most are from the early 80's, including songs from the album ""Rio"". There are a couple of songs I think are overrated, including ""A View to a Kill"". However the others are great, and ""Come Undone"" along with ""Ordinary World"" are beautiful songs they released in 1993. Hardcore fans would probably own all of the albums but I'm happy with this album (for now). It includes most songs you would want in a single disc, but if you're into B-sides and other rarities you're out of luck."
2,Don't waste your money,"The device does not do what it is supposed to do. Failed to provide timely warning of imminent battery failure. Also I could not get it to provide some of the information it was supposed to provide according to the instructions. I feel this device is a gimmick not worth putting on your car, just check your battery once in a while as you should!It does provide voltage info, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars..."
3,battery monitor?,"this product is not what i need. my car has a short some where under the hood .this monitors the battery, so i gave it to my friend and it works for him."
4,Useful tool,"Just installed for a week, it is good to know the condition of battery when check the engine compartment."
3,Eden's Law HP # 628,"Joss Hamblyn was nice to everyone but Meredith Paxton, because of what he had heard about her from others about her.Merdeith is treated with prejudice by Joss, but her family seem not to see this.Joss is a wonderful man, to everyone but Meredith, and she has reason to be angry at him, but she is the one that gets the raw in of the stick, to where he has to help her.When she comes to his aid, Joss treats her with contempt.But the hoochy mama that takes her place she is cool with him, even though she puts the children he loves at risk."
1,Doesn't fit,"The length is good, but the width was the problem. I went to put it on my Venza and the wiper blade would come off, because it was 1/16 of an inch short in width."
5,Best Wipers Made!!,"PIAA Supersilicone wiper blades are the best blades that are made and they last for years instead of weeks. If you follow the instructions for first use, they work perfect. No chatter, smooth operation, and a crytal clear windshield every swipe. I always go to an autoparts website and enter my vehicle information then order the recommended part number from amazons site. I did not have any fitment issues like some others stated. Fits perfect, works perfect. Order the right part and it will work beautifully."
2,too short for 2001 BMW 330ci,"The blade is one inch to short even though the amazon tool said it fit my car, a 2001 BMW 330ci. What a pain"
1,Does not fit '03 Subaru Impreza WRX,"Do not trust the Amazon search feature that lets you narrow your choice by which parts fit your car. It did not fit my car, which apparently requires an 8mm blade refill, rather than a 6mm blade refill. I guess Amazon only measures the length of the refill, not the width. I'll be returning these. The blade itself seems to be perfectly acceptable, but obviously, it doesn't fit, in spite of what Amazon says."
2,Definitely not one-size-fits-all,"The replacement blades were the correct length, but they were too wide to slip easily into the slot occupied by the previous blade. Even after cutting the blade so that it would fit, the blades quickly warped and left streaks on the window (although admittedly this is probably because I had to alter the blade to make it fit). I trashed this product within a week and just bought the full wiper arm with blade."
4,Silicone works well on the windshield,"I like the effect of the silicone on the windshield. It makes the water drops more rounded and the space in between them clearer, so the visibility is better without having to turn on the wipers so often. I could see the difference on the areas where the silicone wiper doesn't go. The water drops are splayed out and one can't see through them. It's blurry.I'm not giving it 5 stars yet because I used them only for 2 weeks so far. I want to see how long they last."
2,Let Us Compare Mythologies,I was hoping he would relate to more than just Christian philosophy. I was disappointed. The other books about him are much better
1,What ever happened to originality?,"It was shocking what a rip-off of ""You've Got Mail"" this book was! The author should have to pay royalties to the movie folks. Unbelievable! And it wasn't even well done. The ""sick scene"" was almost exactly the same as the movie."
1,You've Got Mail 2,"I usually enjoy Patricia Kay's books, but no matter how much I wanted to like this one, I couldn't. I barely even read the second half because I had already seen the movie! I was already getting incredibly irritated by the similarities. This book follows the plot to ""You've Got Mail"" ALMOST EXACTLY. One reviewer already mentioned how Nick brings flowers when Lorna is sick. Well, there's also the ending, in which he brings his dog to meet her at the park for the first time and she says something to the effect of ""I'd hoped it would be you!"" (Which is, I believe, what Meg Ryan says in the movie.) Nick goes through the exact same process of winning Lorna's affection as Tom Hanks' character. I finished this book only because I had read previous books about Lorna's family and wanted to follow up. I really enjoyed those books, but if you've seen ""You've Got Mail"", this book is a DEFINITE pass. Hopefully we will see a return to her higher quality of work."
5,"Diary of a Zen Nun by Nan Shin, Nancy Amphoux","An interesting and inspiring book which I've read and re read, and continue to dip into it over and over."
5,Awesome,"I ordered this CD back in December, but did not receive it till February. I've been listening to this CD everyday and I'm not going to get tired, because this is the best Trance CD in the World. I already bought numbers: 14,15,16,17 and this was the latest edition that I bought. If you are a real Trance fan, just buy it now."
4,One of the better Masterworks boxes,"As always with these huge cubes of music it is not all good. But you get 52 symphonies in the excellent set from Nimbus, the complete piano sonatas on a period instrument, which are quite decent. The Creation is good. The trios are pretty good too, and the rest is mediocre. So, if you want a boatload of symphonies and the piano sonatas this is a good choice."
3,Interesting,"I am originally from the new york/new jersey area and I found it interesting and needed however, I felt it lacked depth and strength in the diversity of interviews and people interviewed. This is good to have if you are a fan of b-ball and particularly if you are from the area. Excellent conversational piece for any true b-baller....good to have in the house no doubt."
4,Interesting perspective of damaged lives,"Never having considered what it meant to be German and the impact of WWII on their lives, I found this book to be an interesting series of accounts. The over-arching theme (to me) was one of damaged lives. The sad part is that German children often suffered an aftermath which they were victims of as well. While I in no way condone German behavior up to a during WW 2, this is a chronicle of suffering and guilt and consequences.It was an interesting, but sad, book.There were no real winners in WW 2 - sure there was a victorious side, but victory certainly had a cost as well. Tragedy and difficult lives....sad..."
4,Enlightening.,"This is an engrossing, enlightening book. To Paul Forster: I think you needed to read the book."
2,Not quite what I expected....,"If you are looking for a book discussing what life was like for the Germans during war-time Germany, this is not the book for you. I thought it was going to be a first hand account of life in Germany during World War II...my latest research fasciantaion. The book is actually stories told to the author and I felt the author spent considerable time complaining that she will carry the stigma that follows many German's after Hitler's atrocities. As I said, not as I expected and was very disappointed in the book. I don't even know if I will be able to give the book away on a book trading site!"
1,Enough Already,"This book is nothing more than another anti-German hate book ! I am so sick of these pathetic self hating ""Germans"". Please explain to me how a young German is responsible for something that happened 30 or 40 years before they were born. WWII has been over for more than fifty years now,isn't it about time we called of the hate war we have been waging against the Germans since 1914 ?!"
5,Some of their best songs all together on one album,"Bee Gees is one of those great groups that just never fade away. Just when you thought you had outgrown / forgotten them, they bounce back with a new album or a compilation such as this one (a live performance in the US) and the feeling of nostalgia is exactly like a warm blanket and hot chicken soup on a cold rainy day !! Seriously !!I have been listening to the group (on and off and in between albums) for almost 20 years now (am 32) and everytime I return to them I get goose pimples the first time I hear them, especially after a long hiatus. This particular compilation has some of the best songs of the group (though the smash hit ""You win again"" from the album ESP was missed). The group is was always and will always be one of my personal favorites and I would strongly recommend this album."
5,great music,This is a great cd i also have the dvd that is what me want to buy the cd so i can listen to it in the car to
3,Cool!,I must say that I liked this live album very much. There is a chance to see songs like Grease and Islands in the stream(Which I thought was better than the original version) performed by the group for the first time! My only quibble is that they do not include songs like You win again and Secret Love. These were big hits so why did they not include them? Anyway apart from that a good effort!
5,A wonderful collection of Bee Gees songs,"I bought this CD immediately after seeing them in concert in Buenos Aires, to have the chance to live again and again one of the most touching experiences in my life. Brothers Gibb have always been part of it, and I never had thought they could come down here. I love the medley that includes many of the most pop songs ever composed, and I enjoy listening once more to the disco songs. Barry, Mo and Robin are still the best!"
5,great cd...,I was born in 1973 when they where still playing and i am now 27 years old and this cd is very very good. I LOVE IT!
5,ANY De Ja Vu is a good one!,"With disco cover bands (like the Boogie Knights in Los Angeles) having a field day in night clubs and a renewed interest in 70's music, perhaps the Bee Gees took notice. This LIVE CD is refreshing to hear because everything is so crisp and ""high fidelity"" sounding compared to the old studio recordings. Instrumentally everything sounds better than ever. The only thing that is at times sub-par is Barry's falsetto voice when he sings alone. Maybe it was the Las Vegas weather or maybe his voice just matured. Who knows? Some of his imperfections add character but sometimes I found myself wincing .... Yet miraculously Barry's performance is rescued by absolutely FLAWLESS backup vocals. The harmonies sound absolutely PRO! I give any band 5 stars for making a return 20 + years later. Nobody in the current era seems to be able to write a song like they used to."
2,I prefer the original recordings,"I expected the trio to sound just as good as they did years ago and I was disappointed. Barry Gibb does not sound as good. The music on this CD was better than the vocals. I only liked 3 out of the 24 songs listed on the CD ( You Should Be Dancing, Night Fever/More Than a Woman, and How Deep is Your Love). Only a true Bee Gee fan would love this CD, but then again, they would love anything the Bee Gees produced. I'm going to search for CD's of the orginal recordings because I know those recordings will sound as good as I remember them."
5,One Night Only by the Bee Gee's,"This CD is as wonderful as any that I have. I also have the DVD of this performance, which I like even better. I absolutely love the Bee Gee's and play their music all the time. I recommend this CD or any other that they have available."
5,A DEFINITE MUST FOR ANY BEE GEES FAN!!!,"I saw the HBO special and I was blown away! I went and purchased this CD. INCREDIBLE! The Bee Gees are in top form, and the vocals and harmonies are AWESOME! I think Barry's falsetto vocals are absolutely FABULOUS! All of my favorites are here, and the new stuff as well. The bee gees still sound great. I urge you, GO OUT AND BUY THIS AT ONCE! It's money well spent."
5,Super album of Current BeGee's,"This is the sound track from the A&E cable channel BeeGee's special of the same name. It has all the best songs with current renditions (it was recorded only several years ago) Not that old BeeGee recordings are that bad. But,the group has matured over the last 40 years. ""One Night Only"" is far superior to their early work."
5,SOUNDTRACK FROM THE GREAT HBO SPECIAL FROM THE MGM GRAND,AFTER SEEING THIS HBO SPECIAL I IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED THIS CD. IF YOU ARE A BEE GEE FAN THIS IS A MUST FOR YOUR COLLECTION
5,The best!,"""One night only"" is probably the best album ever made. It is so great that it makes me cry almost every time. And, unlike normal CD's, there is not a single song which is not beautiful, it is truly amacing!"
5,Super Concert to Remember,"This was one of the final concerts performed before Maurice Gibb died. All of the classic hits How Deep Is Your Love, Night Fever, and a special tribute to the brother Andy Gibb, All of the hits plus a special guest appearance by Celine Dion. Purchase this c.d. and it is one you will long enjoy. Delivered in good time in great shape. James Mell"
2,Good Music but Not Enough of It,"Most of the songs on the disc have been shortened from recording studio length to anywhere from one to three minutes.Seriously, Heartbreaker and Nights on Broadway in 1:05?Not nearly as much fun."
3,Trite Writing About A Very Important Topic,"Rodney Howard-Browne has given us a treatise on a much needed topic, the real Jesus. He covers various aspects of who Jesus is as opposed to what ""religious"" people think who Jesus is. He covers nearly every conceivable topic in relationship to the nature of Jesus.Howard-Browne's theology is mostly solid. There is ample biblical support given for his assertions that Jesus is much different from the pseudo-Jesus taught by much of the Church. He brings out the important fact that Jesus wants to bless the members of the Church.All the positive points covered in this book are muddled by very trite writing. It was difficult to read entire paragraphs consisting of the same three word sentence repeated numerous times. The very real and compassionate minister of the gospel hid behind parody and silliness in his delivery of the subject. The theology gets 5 stars; the writing style a 1. Thus my overall rating of a 3."
3,works for me,This is a easy to install dummy door knob. I used to to replace a missing dummy door knob on a closet door in the master bedroom of my home. I works just like it is supposed to. Seems to be made of quality materials and will accent the decor of almost any home.
3,"Not your ordinary sc-fi, decadent, end-of-civ thriller","Nihilistic, romantic, gross, comic, violent, allusive, literary, literate, pulp-ish, bittersweet -- schizophrenia on a leash and a gem in the rough -- this debut novel is both challenging and rewarding for those not faint of heart."
4,It's ok,"I wanted to try this and I think watermelon for me is best just eating it not brushing with it. I mixed it with my other toothpaste like this one but plain colgate mint, since I didn't want to waste it and my money. It's a pretty good mixture though :)"
3,Encyclopedia of the Ancient WESTERN World,"I wish I would have been able to see the Table of Contents before ordering this book. So for those who are wondering...It basically has three sections... 1) Egyptians 2) Greeks 3) Romans. Those sections are very well done, and I'm sure my son (4yo) and I will enjoy reading this together. However, there's is soooo much left out! Africa, China, Americas (Aztecs, Maya, Inca), etc.I understand that the history of these other civilizations and geographies hasn't been as influential on most westerners' culture/history/worldview, and I'm not looking for a PC perspective. I just hoped that my son would at least see that there were other people around the world, living in other ways during those times too. I'll continue searching for a book that covers early history more broadly at an appropriate age level."
1,WTF!!!!!!!??????,"Mini-Best? BIG MISTAKE! If they were to create a REAL MINI-Best, they could've put at least 5 original songs instead of just 3 original songs (Jump, Panama, Top of the World) and hell, those aren't even Halen's best? And for the karaoke songs, they could've put em on a WHOLE compliation of Karaoke Van Halen songs. SHEESH! Did the band really do this?! I think NOT. The record company should be shot for making this F****** OVERPRICED FOR ONLY 5 DAMN SONGS. Import or not, it's BEYOND a waste of cash."
1,Pet Bed Warmer,Very poor qualitiy and value. Warmer has a very strong solvent smell when used. Not recommended.
5,One of the best folk back-up bands ever,"There is something for everyone on this album. Not a bad song in the bunch. This album is neither repetitious nor unharmonious. It features not only Arlo's vast talents, but those of some well-loved local Berkshires band members, formerly known as Boogity Shoe. At last, Steve Ide and the others get well-deserved & long-overdue recognition as being exceptional players on many instruments. And as always, Arlo pays due respect to some of the best song-writers ever. Though I still have a vinyl copy of this record, the songs & their lyrics, the players & their talents, will always be etched in my mind as wonderful a collaboration as chocolate & strawberries, as if mere musicians could do that."
5,The best of Montez,"This is a must for Chris Montez fans and, indeed, anyone prepared to be bewitched by a legendary example of the sounds of the Swinging Sixties.The technical standard is brilliant, with a rare crispness which brings out every detail both of the voice and of those deceptively simple but mindblowing instrumental and backing arrangements.The CD is pricey but it has 25 tracks, including at least seven of Chris's monster hits, and is musically worth every cent. The only weak track is, of all positions, the first - a live performance of ""Because of You"", so ineptly recorded as to beggar belief."
2,"Can movies be used to ""Heal?""","I encountered this gem as a wannabe text book in 1998.The author makes a big deal out of using movies as a self help device. The problem I have with this book how the author judges the movies he presents. Get a copy and read ""Solomon's"" description of your favorite movie. It as if he stretches his views and theory's around a movie that just are not there. A case in point is The Great Santini / The Gift of Fury (1979). A coming of age movie with a dedicated Marine Pilot as the father. Gary Solomon treats this movie as Child Abuse. Gary misses the point completely. Once you begin to actually look at the movies he recommends his Prescription falls flat on its face! It is the same self help mumbo jumbo for a buck that hits the book stores every day. I would go so far as to say this is a Toxic book. Toxic in the same way as using aspirin to grow hair on your head.If a college instructor hands this book to you hand it back and drop the class."
1,What a Cryin' Shame,"If you're a Sinatra fan, this hurts! It saddens me to think that a young person might but this album and think to himself, ""What in the world was so special about this guy?"" Please buy ""Only the Lonely,"" ""In the Wee Small Hours,"" ""Sinatra and Strings,"" ""A Swingin' Affair,"" ""Come Dance with Me,"" ""Songs for Swingin' Lovers,"" and get an idea what made this man a cultural icon. ""Duets"", a project foisted on an elderly Sinatra clouds the greatest of the Voice who, I'm certain, would have never conceived or permitted such a project at this moment of his life."
4,Great value,"This came exactly as described. The only issue, and I'm not sure if it is just me, is that the new wipes don't seem to pop up and stay like the old ones did."
4,A good product,"I like this product very much. I use them all the time and have no problem with flushing. I try to flush only two at a time and even if I have to flush twice (on my extremely low-flush water-saver toilet), they go down, no problem. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the Wet Ones brand of flushable wipes is cheaper."
1,Not what I expected,"The price was very high. I thought that I was getting a pack of multiple refills, not just one pack. Also, they clog your toilet. That was really expensive!"
5,beautiful book,"i love this book. i first saw it at a baby shower where my friend recieved it as a gift. i soon after went and bought it for myself and my kids. i love it. the illistrations are BEAUTIFUL, and i like that it goes through all the letters and says something our our Lord for each letter. Plus there is a scripture verse for every letter as well. I think its a great tool for Christian Parenting. I highly recommend it!"
1,WEED KILLER APPLICCATOR,THE ITEM LOOKS EASY TO USE BUT IT DOSEN'T WORK. THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS ON USE.THE WICK STAYS DRY. I HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE CHECK IT OUT AND THEY CAN NOT GET IT TO WORK
5,great train table,"After reviewing different train tables for a couple of weeks, I decided to purchase this Melissa and Doug table through Amazon. I was extremely pleased with the price, the overall quality of the table and the ease of assembly. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a train table."
4,A great starting point for developing your own NT-based site,"Wyatt provides a reference that is across the board in terms of technical knowledge. Having been given the challenge of tying our in-house databases as an auxiliary website to our .com site, I found this book to hold most of the answers. He goes into step-by-step detail in many areas, but falls a little short of giving readers a broad view of applying the principles. A great reference that finds its way off the shelf and onto my desk a lot!"
1,Avoid this book.,"After reading this book, it is obvious to me the this author is highly competent technically, and also a very skillful writer.If you ingnore the title, then I feel that this is a well written and informative book.Unfortunately, I feel it had very little to do with IIS administration. The cover declares it to be a ""COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE"", don't believe it.This book is a very good introduction to web page design, with chapters on Frontpage 98 and Visual Interdev, while IIS installation is relegated to a mere appendix.More than the first half of the book chapters are classed into categories such as ""Developing Basic Web Site Content"", etc. , and while it may be useful to many IIS admins who also happen to develop their site. It is not in my opinion, what IIS Admininstration is all about."
5,One of the better books on IIS management,"This book is a complete reference on IIS. From the start it takes you through IIS in a very readable form, and has all of the infofrmation needed for the beginner to the advanced IIS admin. A good book, buy it!"
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I usually get tired around nine o'clock and am in bed by ten. However, when I read Spring Rain, I stayed up until 1:15 AM-until I finished reading it. I couldn't put it down! Gayle does a masterful job of combining a sensitive subject with a powerful story. While she addresses AIDS, homosexuality and Christianity, at no time does Spring Rain feel preachy. Instead it is a beautiful love story told with mystery and drama. If you like a good read, if you like a sweet romance, and if you like a touch of suspense Spring Rain is the book for you!"
4,Sensitive subjects done well,"This book is more romance novel than anything else, so it may be the last in the series for me. Not a fan of formulaic romances. But, as other reviewers wrote, Roper deserves much credit for handling beautifully the sensitive issues of AIDS as well as teen pregnancy. She was true to Scripture but also covered it all in grace and love, the perfect example for all believers. Developing the character of an AIDS victim goes a long way to personalizing the issue and avoiding stereotypes. I just hate to see any Christian author use the term ""Mother Nature"" in their writing. That term is reserved for secularists who personify Mother Earth as an entity with a mind of ""her own"". Nature, yes, Mother, no."
3,Giant roll a nest--Rats LOVE IT!!,"If you have RATS you need Grassy-roll-a nests! I have 30 pet rats and they like these nests better than any hideouts I have tried. I have 5 rats in a large cage, and all pile up together inside the nest. It's funny seeing heads, feet, and tails sticking out of a nest! I line the nests with nesting materials to keep it fresh longer. If you have 4 or more rats a Giant size nest is best. There are also medium size nests for fewer or small rats. I use a large safety pin to anchor the nest to the top wire shelf as the rat love being on the highest shelf. Try the grassy nests; your rat friends will love you for it."
1,not recommended for a chinchilla who likes to chew....,My chinchilla tore this hutch apart within a week. It was an inexpensive hutch but still not worth it at all.
4,King of Queens Season 4,"I loved seasons one and two the most, but all 4 are quite comical. Jerry stiller really makes the show.....especially this season."
5,FRUSTRATED FAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As I said in my review of the series ""Charmed"". Why are these shows released so slowly when they have been around so long and are popular? Recent, stupid shows have released their DVD's faster. That stinks and it's irritating. When are we going to get Season 5 of this show?!!!! Of course, then we'll just be waiting another year for season 6 and so on (ugh). Anyone else agree?Still waiting to see ""Mamma's Family"" released on DVD, but I have a feeling I'll be holding my breathe 'til I'm dead. lol"
1,Leaking disaster,"I poured the bubble solution into his mouth and it went straight down the toy, through the battery compartment and within seconds I felt the solution dripping onto my legs. I tried many different ways to pour the solution in--slowly, quickly, a small amount, a large amount--and I got the same results every time. It never blew one single bubble. Any plastic, battery-operated toy into which you must pour a liquid solution is simply one big design flaw. Stick to the bubble blowers where you pour the solution into an exterior reservoir of some sort."
2,Its cute but leaks like crazy,"This toy is so cute and a cute idea, but it leaks like crazy! We have a few, not just Nemo, and they are all the same! We are so happy with the stand alone bubble machines! Karima Mohamed"
1,still a leaky mess,"Can't believe they are still making this toy after all the miserable reviews going back for years. This is awful. Leaks and doesn't blow bubbles well at all. My 3 year wound up in tears becasue she couldn't get it to work, even with my help."
1,Would be nice if it didnt leak all over your hand,When we received this in the mail it was clear it had already been open and used. They just put it back in the box and taped it shut. So they new they were selling a damaged product. It was my sons birthday and this is what he really wanted so I couldnt return it.We just dont put bubbles in it. He pretends.Otherwise the bubbles leak all the way down your arm.
3,fun but can spill easily,I like it. But I have to press the trigger several times to bet the bubbles going. Not a real big deal. It can spill easily. It must be held level at all times! I got it to play with my 4 month old. I felt it would be easier not to have to dip a wand in a bottle while holding her. so it works the way I wanted it to. I can operate it with one hand and hold my little girl in the other. She enjoys seeing the bubbles and I don't have sticky hands or have to worry about tipping over a whole bottle of the stuff. Overall I am very happy with the purchase.
2,having nighmares,the video in itself is not that bad but if you want this to be a family event i would stay away. the one kangaroo you get to know and love dies. you see it from when it is first born to about 10 months old. the mother leaves it behind and Jaffy gets attacked by animals. when the mother finally goes back to find him the kangaroo is to weak to go with her. so you have to sit there and watch the poor thing die.
5,This tapestry grows on you...,"If I had to choose a desert Island disc of the 1000 or so albums I have, then this would be one of the contenders. A marvellous sonic storm of a record."
3,"well, at least the name is pretty representative","this collection of barely-there tunes just sounds too washed up to me. i recognize this is considered a good album by the band's fans, and i can repsect that, but for the rest of us, there's just not enough here to hold interest. waves of shimmering chords everywhere you turn, muted drums, soft guitars, everything too soft. best to stick with their greatest hits."
2,Boring...School book,This book was required for school. I read it through most of it and its very wordy and not much real content.
2,Handling of product,this product seems to be a useful one but due to improper handling of the product it reached me in a state where by the 120 volts port was not functioning so i cannot use portable devices to my benefit.
2,POP! smoke ... dead,"Something went POP/ZAP inside, followed by some smoke. This wasn't a blown fuse. The LED lights came on, but nothing worked. I was trying to run a very small vaccuum for a few seconds to clear out the dust before taking inside. It's supposed to shut itself down if overloaded. I think this was the first time I used the outlet.I received a replacement and will be sure to test the outlet right away, and then use it only for small stuff. I had the unit for over a year and used it regularly for inflating car tires. It's slow and loud but it worked well enough. The pressure gauge was even pretty close (1psi high compared to an industrial gauge from Schrader). I have never used it to jump start a car. I'll put on safety glasses if I do..."
4,Batt Pack,"First, do not leave thsse units in a completly discharged state as it does harm to the logevity of its batteries - be sure and read and follow the owners instructions. I've had other bat packs over the years (I'm a retired repossessor) and this one is the most versatile: equipped with a light, air pump and the very useful a/c and d/c adaptors. Just one jump start in an inaccessible place with nobody around to help and no cell phone reception is worth the full purchase price."
5,Love this thing,Love this thing. Air compressor works great. Nice when I had a slow leak in my tire. I'd just leave it in the trunk I case it got low before I could get to a gas station. Power for camping and jump starter. Best purchase ever although I wish it had 2 ac outlets like the previous model.
2,"it is good for everything else, but does not start 8-cilinder car","the main purpose of buying it was to jump start my car, because when i drive only short distances(several blocks) for a couple of weeks, my battery dies. my car has 8 cilinders, and the first $40 jumpstarter couldn't start it. i returned it and bought this one, but it doesn't start my car either. if you are bying this unit for starting your car, make sure it will be powerfull enough for your car. i realized it after 30 days and was not able to return."
2,Over rated,"Power pack arrived 2/3rd charged! I suspect it was a return, but no proof of that. After fully charging I connected a 100 Christmas mini light string to it. It only lasted 2 hours. I used it later to pump up two bicycle tires. It did that in only a few minutes. Have not need to use the jump starter yet."
4,Power Station,"Fully charged the unit per instructions. Wont run my 32"" TV, but it DOES run the 19"" TV. For 2 hours.Got this unit primarily to run the small electrical fan of the gas fireplace in case of power outages during ice storms. Am confident it can do this for 12 hours or so --- which is all I'm asking."
1,Worthless Junk,"I bought this because my truck is seldom driven and occasionally needs jumped. I also have a tire with a slow leak. Imagine my surprise when, after the unit was fully charged, it would not even begin to turn over the engine when I attempted to jump start my truck.Next I tried to air up a tire. To go from 15 PSI to 25 PSI took nearly 15 minutes! I suppose if you have all day you could eventually hit 35 PSI but I finally got tired of waiting and gave up.Is this unit capable of doing anything successfully? Not that I can tell...."
2,Product Failure,"I owned an identical unit for over ten years & was very pleased with it. When the battery would finally no longer hold a charge, I purchased the exact same unit...about two months ago. However, when I attempted to use the new ""unit"" to inflate a tire, the plastic end ""piece"" broke off of the air hose. Extreamly cold weather might have been a contributing factor toward the failure of the ""plastic piece"". I am going to contact the company next week to ascertain the worthyness of their warrenty."
5,Perfect,THe perfect tool to have in your car if you have battery problems or a leaky tire. This little guy can handle both and the charge on its battery lasts a long time.
1,Very Disappointed,"I own a similar device that I purchased at one of the ""club stores"" 7+ years ago. It's made by a different manufacturer that has been rock solid and it is slightly bigger (500 amps). I needed another one for my second home and decided to buy this Black & Decker model. It worked great for about a year, and then it stopped holding a charge. It won't run the compressor for more than a few minutes, and it won't even jump-start my 2 cylinder motorcycle or my riding mower.Maybe I got a bad unit, but I wouldn't buy another one of these from Black & Decker. It's total junk compared to the other brand that I own (and the B&D; one wasn't cheap). In general, I just haven't had a lot of good luck with Black & Decker products."
1,Owned it for years: never worked once,"I have owned an ElectroMate portable power supply for several years: Over those years, I have used it to try to jump-start 15-20 cars that had dead batteries. In those 15-20 attempts, it literally has never worked once.(Always in mild temperatures, cars that had recently been running.) I was careful to re-charge it after every jump attempt, and to re-charge it after every month or so of non-use. I would even put a date-stamp on it, to be sure that it always had a recent charge. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Today, I took it where it should have gone long ago: To our county recycling facility.I bought a Peak brand power supply for my wife: She has helped dozens of folks with dead batteries, always with 100% success. After we had jumped our neighbors' van several times, we bought them a Peak jump-starter. And (of course) I just bought myself one. So, Black & Decker has absolutely sold us on Peak."
4,Does the job....,This works very easily and does its job. Haven't tried the tire pump yet. Hope not to have to use it. Just remember to recharge this every 60 days so it will still work.
1,Can not return because of Hazardous Material! Do not Buy!,"Extreme word of caution in buying this item or just simply do not buy at all!! I purchased two of these Black & Decker VEC026BD Electromate 400s for both of my vehicles and found that both would not fully charge brand new (said 73% on one and 70% on another). Without a full charge, they were not adequate enough to jump start either of my vehicles. We have attempted to trouble shoot them, but they simply will not take a full charge. I attempted to return them on Amazon LLC within two weeks of purchase, and because these are hazardous material, they will not accept a return. I wish I would have been told this when I purchased the items, because I would have never purchased them. Avoid purchasing these at all costs!"
1,While it lasted,"The B&D Electromate 400 was quite useful while it lasted: it gave up the ghost after two years and can't be resuscitated, which I found most disappointing. Was it worth the expense for two years service? No, so I'll keep my jumper cables within reach and dust off my small electric tire inflator."
1,Good News Bad News,"The good news is that this comes with a two year warranty. The bad news is that the first one I owned only lasted 7 months, the second one lasted 10 months and the third one lasted 11 months. In all three instances it was the air compressor that failed to work. On two occasions we had to pay a considerable amount to ship these back to B&D. The last one they sent to me had a Home Depot sticker on it which made me think that it was a display model.I had actually bought a one year extended warranty at Wal Mart which came in handy though our local Wal Mart no longer carries this item."
3,acceptable but cheap jumper connection,"all the functions seem to work ok for me I use the air compressor to blow up my tires yes it is slow but it works, ac outlets work and it does jump an 8 cylinder vehicle no problem. My only gripe about this thing is that the plastic connector for the jumper cords feels cheap and i imagine it will fall apart with a lot of use. ive had mine for about 2 years now using it only once every couple of months maybe and so far its lasted ill update when something falls apart on it."
2,Not worth the money,Have owned 3. The 1st was great; lasted almost 3 yrs. I bought a 2nd which lasted 60 days. Warranty covered a 3rd which lasted about 14 months. Refuses to hold charge. Used almost exclusively to pump bicycle tires. Will not buy a 4th.
2,it let me down,"I've owned this jumper for almost a year ,mostly used it to inflate tires or beach balls and etc., few days ago tried to jump start my truck which has not been driven for over a week ,I hooked it up and son of a b*&@#h ,click click and click!, so I figured needs more charging so took back home and plugged it in , 2 days later tried again and same thing ,click click and more click!, so I called AAA ,and aaa guy showed up with a hand held jumper 1/3 in size! hooked it up and i was able to start my truck!!!, good thing i didn't have to use in real emergency!"
4,Jump starting a car,"I haven't purchased one of these, but I'm curious if this is as reliable as as a traditional set of jumper cables? Or are there some jobs that jumper cables will do that this will not. Also, how long does it take to jump start a car? Thanks in advance."
2,Unimpressed,"Bought this for jumping off my second vehicle which oftens goes several weeks without being driven and for powering small devices when camping. Worked fine for jumping off the vehicle; however, used the unit to power an electrically powered air mattress inflator and it did fine. Went to plug in the small fan and nothing. For whatever reason, the electrical outlets do not work now. Tried everything.Follow up:Just received my second unit. Charged it 24 hours. Plugged in regular size box fan and the unit's electrical outlet status light starts blinking green and shuts down after less than 2 minutes. Plugged in a small desk top fan and the same thing. Even plugged just my answering machine in and the same thing. Black and Decker must have issued a bad batch since most other reviews are positive.Amazon has been truly amazing. They shipped the replacement model which I received three business days after filing for a return and even had UPS pick up the original one."
2,Will no longer hold a charge,"After owning this for about 2 1/2 years it no longer holds a charge, as a result I am unable to inflate even a bicycle tire before it goes dead on me. I even tried to run it to inflate tires with the charger connected to the household current, no luck. I have to admit I expected more from B&D considering the price, but I guess that's why they only give a 2 year warranty."
4,Works for me,"The B&D VEC026BD is a replacement for a previous similar product. I had been looking around at various replacement options for several months before settling on the VEC026BD. It has the same characteristics and abilities as the one it replaces (including the light and compressor). While clearly this should not be the only option one has for a compressor or power inverter, the VEC026BD does the job it is designed to do. I have not yet had to use it to jump start a vehicle (really - the primary objective). However, based upon the reviews of others, and if one keeps to the plan of keeping the unit sufficiently charged (on A/C charging power at least once a month), the VEC026BD serves a very useful purpose and I recommend it."
5,good product,Bought this as a gift after having purchased one last summer. Very handy and frequently used.
1,Black & Decker VEC026BD Electromate 400 Jump-Starter with Built-In Air Compressor,"DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS JUNK. Air compressor doesn't fill anything up. Won't hold a charge, even after charging it fully. It will die after charging a cell phone. Also, you cannot return it through Amazon, because they consider it hazardous. What a waste.Amazon did come through and refunded the cost. Amazon is a great company. I still say save the hassle and research other products"
4,Very Good Product,"Just recevied this item a few weeks ago, therefore, I have only used it a couple of times so far. But, so far, so good. Everything seems to work well. I would have given it 5 stars, but, the one thing I don't like is the fact that there is no place to carry the jumper cables with the battery box - you have to carry them seperately, which is a little odd!"
4,Similar to to the everything phone,"Not unlike the early camera phone, this Electromate has everything. Unfortunately, that comes with the price of not doing anything of the functions as well as a single unit would. It did save me when I had a flat tire, but it took like 6-7 minutes to inflate my tire to 40 psi. The inverter outlets are great, but again limited on the amps that can run through. It would not run a halogen light when I was trying to do some work at night. Overall it's very useful, but just realize it will have some limitations."
1,I Bought Three and just had to use one for real,"At least my car was in the driveway when it decided not to start so it wasnt too bad. I am now searching on amazon for one with higher than 400 power. It would not start my six cylinder engine on my crossfire. I think it will be ok in the other vehicles that have four cylinders. No way this would ever start a V8. It was fully charged just not enough oomph. The K&K; models look interesting but I am not excited about having to tend them while they are charged to prevent damage. Unit does work well for powering less taxing things though and the pump works well, just wont start your car if you have a six cylinder or up.Hope this helps."
4,Buy new because they won`t repair the old.,These are great power boxes. B & D bought out Vector who made the original VEC026 400.Tried to get B & D to repair the identical Vector unit I already owned and they refused.So I purchased one to have back-up power available. Could of had it easier and cheaperif they would have fixed my original identical unit. Guess I get to throw the new Electromate400 away if it fails and needs repair.
2,nice but flawed...,I purchased this 1 year ago. The price was ok and the Black and Decker name was reassuring. It worked pretty well for pumping up my lawn tractor and dirtbike tires until last week. Everything works fine on the unit EXCEPT the air pump (which is the main reason I purchased it). The compressor turns on but no air. The air hose attachment is no better than a manual pump. BUYER BEWARE!
3,Works well for about 1.5 years,"I bought this product to replace my non-operational cigarette lighter in my car (not to light cigarettes, to power things). This product worked very well to power all of my devices as well as inflate our car tires on many occasions. Yes it will power most devices. No, it will not power your microwave if your power goes out. It was worth a try. The battery lasts forever and ever once it is charged. However this product lasted a little over a year and there after would not charge at all. It is now a very large paper weight."
5,"Loved it enough to by a third, for personal use, as well as 3 for my work","This is a very reliable jump starter and I love the fact that it is paired with a tire inflator... this is useful for inflating tires on an unwieldy trailer and how many gas stations have convenient tire inflation any more? Plus, I use it for camping for portable power. I've even run a small PA system off of it at work! I also like the fact that it recharges with a regular, three-prong, extention cord... no specialized ""DC tranformer"" needed! The only downside I can think of is that the charging cables are not permanently connected to the unit, and thus need to be kept track of/nearby as an integral component for jump-starts. But even that isn't all downside, since replacement cables are available from the manufacturer and are easy to connect to the charger. I love this thing and have gotten more than my money's worth out of it!"
3,"Disappointed, product info wrong","I was disappointed by this product and ended up not keeping it. The pictures seem to suggest it has 2 AC ports and 2 DC ports. It does not. It has one AC and one DC port. It doesn't come with an AC charging cord, you need to have an extension cord and plug it in. The air-compressor is particularly loud. I'm sure it does its job of jump-starting well, but it wasn't as advertised, so I didn't keep it.I did get the same model, but with the radio instead of the air compressor (listed as a separate product on Amazon). I'm very happy with that model. It does have 2 AC and 2 DC and a USB charge port, plus an AM/FM radio and NOAA alert radio including simply monitoring for new alerts. I'm much happier with that version."
2,useless after a while,"I bought two of these units (not from amazon). I had a couple of occasions to use it on batteries. Even though I charged the unit, it failed to charge a car battery on about the third battery I tried to charge. These were not back to back chargings but spread over a period of time. Also, the air compressor failed after a while in one unit. Basically I rate these poorly, being trustworthy only as a one shot deal."
1,Let Me Down When Tornadoes Came,"I bought the Black and Decker Electromate 400 Power Station for my wife when our girls developed the bad habit of flipping on interior lights in her van and draining her battery. I would have just bought an extra battery and a trickle charger, but I thought the Electromate Power Station would come in handy in an emergency. It worked great for a few months. Then I left it on charge so it would be ready in case of emergency. When tornadoes swept through Northern Alabama and the power was out, I turned to my Electromate Power Station to keep my cell phone charged. It failed. Somehow the battery was totally drained, despite having been plugged into the wall up until the power outage. I'm disappointed to have wasted my money on a piece of emergency equipment that failed me when I needed it the most."
5,A terrific debut...no filler at all,"I defy anyone to listen to 'Boot Scootin' Boogie' and not want to get up and dance. It just grabs a hold and pulls you to your feet. Just try to resist!! Most of these songs are up-tempo danceable numbers, but then there's the beautiful ballad 'Neon Moon'. A terrific debut, and just a hint of the great stuff yet to come."
3,Bulky,"The holster is very nice looking, materials are nice but it is extremely bulky so in reality as a day to day holster is not really an option.I bought another holster as well , a Galco one for my daily use and will keep this one for the shooting range."
4,Great little bag with little price.,"Nice product, great price, Fit the small Sony Sureshot cameras well."
2,Too many typos. Vague explanations. Unoriginal exercises.,"This is not the one I would recommend. This book amuses you with lots of typos, such as ``head conduction'', instead of ``heat conduction'' and some weird mathematical notations, like 1 over vector r, in TeX notation, \frac{1}{\vec{r}}. (Some say it is better than Chow's _Classical Mechanics_. That book had three ``vertical'' dots over a varaible.) Not just that. I just finished solving an exercise set for a chapter on complex variables and some problems are identical to Murray R. Spiegel's _Complex Variables_. Not a word was different."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"This book mixes the brevity of Schaum's Outlines with the incomprehensibility of The Tao of Pooh. The author copies, sometimes, directly from either Schaum's or Arfkin. There is nothing noteworthy in this book and your money is better spent buying the original books, i.e. Schaum's. I am supprised that Cambridge University Press would publish this and not fear the litigation from more respectable authors who Chow copied this from. If you wrote a Schaum's or any Math Methods book please check for plagairism, it is there. If you are a Prof. thinking of assigning this book, Don't. And if you are a student who is required to buy this book, use the original Schaum's Outlines!"
4,"For very dry spots, this is an excellent ...","For very dry spots, this is an excellent product. It's not too sticky or greasy and it works well to soften my rough, dry skin. I like it a lot and I'll continue to use it."
3,This ointment works very well on minor burns ...,"This ointment works very well on minor burns and scrapes, and softens my dry skin very well. The main drawback is its very greasy feeling -- it feels very much like petroleum jelly. It barely absorbs into my skin at all. Because of that, I'd recommend it for burns, but not for dry skin."
5,"Great for those with vitiligo, eczema and super parched skin","This ointment is great to paste on those with vitiligo before swimming in chlorinated water to protect the skin , babies with eczema, or anyone with very dry skin. Just remember to moisten your skin with water, and pat dry first, BEFORE applying the ointment. That aquaphor then locks in the moisture from the water to keep your skin hydrated all day and through the night"
5,Aquaphor Healing Ointment,Works great on rough dry patches on elbows and knees or any place dry skin is a problem.It's a petroleum type salve that absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling very soft.
4,They're All Here,"You've Got Your Troubles, Here It Comes Again and 5&1/2 years later, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again. All here and all the originals. I can't add much to the other reviewers except to say that this is a nice CD.Just about every song is listenable and that says something as sometimes you get the hits but you also get the misses; not here. Good CD even if it costs a little more. No matter what age we live in you still get what you pay for."
2,over 50s rock and roll fan,apart from the well known singles the rest are orchestated rubbish if you are looking for a bit of rock and rythem leave this one alone
3,Not Her Best Work,"A few radio hits salvage an otherwise forgettable set of tunes on this release. The keepers include the spunky ""Shake the Sugar Tree"", the Tammy Wynette-ish ballad ""Do You Know Where Your Man Is"", the tongue-in-cheek ""Cleopatra, Queen of Denial"", & the ballad ""Let That Pony Run"". Most of the rest is just filler material, the worst being ""Fine, Fine, Very Fine Love"", & the duet with Diamond Rio's Marty Roe, ""Love Is Only Human"". If your looking for your first purchase, go with either ""Sweetheart's Dance"" or ""Put Yourself in My Place""."
3,"THE ALBUM STUMBLES, FALLS FLAT","HOMEWARD LOOKING ANGEL stumbles and falls flat. There are two ""great"" songs on this album; ""Let The Pony Run"" and ""How Gone is Goodbye"". There are three ""good"" songs; ""Do You Know Where Your Man Is"", ""Shake The Sugar Tree"" and ""Homeward Looking Angel"". And there is one just ""okay"" song; the jazzy ""Cleopatra, Queen Of Denial"". The rest of this album is totally forgettable, especially the truly awful ""Fine, Fine, Very Fine Love"" which is anything but fine. Best recommendation, use your CD burner to lift the good tracks an make them part of a ""favorites compilation"", then toss the original."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FLATWARE!,"I hate to sound so harsh, but I wish I had not wasted my money on it. I fell in love with the feel and look of this flatware, so I bought 3 sets. (20 pcs. per set) I had read a few negative reviews, but I thought maybe it was the consumers fault they were having rust problems. I was also just hoping for the best in my case.FIRST WASH (hand wash) and there were rust spots all over. Some large spots, some small...but rust all over. I have tried a number of approaches to prevent the rusting, but nothing seems to work. This is the 18/0 set, I read that the 18/10 is better and wont rust. I wish I could find where to buy that one, but frankly I don't have time to try this all over again.I hate to discourage anyone, because it is SO PRETTY, but I would NEVER BUY THIS set.Cambridge should be ashamed of selling this, because it it supposed to be QUALITY flatware. Thois may as well be BIG LOTS brand."
1,Beautiful look and feel.......until you wash it!!,"We received 3 sets of this for a wedding present. I really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand. However, after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots. After two more washes the rust got worse. These are supposed to be dishwasher safe! There are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them, but who has the time for that these days? Despite the apeal of the set, we decided to try something else. It's a shame because it's such a pretty set (before the wash of course!)."
1,First rate junk....,"I bought two sets of these about 4 months ago. After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots. They rubbed off fairly easily, but as time has gone by, they are looking very bad. Tonight while eating, I got a sliver in my finger from the fork! I have NEVER had a piece of flatware peel. I'm going back to my old flatware. Sure glad I saved it! DON'T BUY THIS JUNK."
3,Cambridge forks,Nice heavy set but the get rust spots on them sometimes even though it is stainless steel. It is cheap chinese metal that is not purified as good as American steel.
3,Thumbs up for Nicole Oring,"I am a die hard fan of Nicole Oring. She is the tightest sexiest asian adult actress out there. However, it seems that in every film she makes, there is an added tattoo to her tight body, to which I don't find appealing. Tattoos can be sexy; but too many can dull a sharp knife. Don't pay more than a few$$ for this video however."
5,Stunning writing,"Rebecca Solnit is an amazing writer. She brings to the surface all the hidden currents of the Muybridge story in a narrative that is at once informative and moving. This book constantly surprised and delighted me with its deep insights and fascinating details. Not only is it well researched, but the results of the research are germane to the story and are all neatly brought together. It was a pleasure to discover that fine writing like this still exists. I can't wait to read her other books now that I have found her."
2,Bonfire,I love tingle and this is a pretty stong tingle. It made me feel and look like instant results. It smells wonderful also.
4,Good intro,This was a good introduction to the different cultural and geographical elements of Georgia. It could be used as a guide book in country but I wouldnt trust it for day-to-day planing and movement. This should just serve as a helpful guide to deciding which areas you would like to visit and different historical sites to learn about and then explore.
4,Not the complete second season!,"I am deeply disappointed. The episode ""KickBall 2: The Kickening"" is missing. The title of the DVD is misleading. However: GREAT SHOW."
3,Writing Suffered in this season,I had a hard time getting through the episodes in this season. I couldn't find the humor in the jokes as easily as first season.
2,no eng subtitle?,"what? no English subtitle? i love the show a lot, bought season one and been looking forward to season 2...but if there is no eng subtitle, i wonder if i could get all the jokes, since im not a native speaker"
4,Good,My friend got me into this show and I can say I'm very glad they did. Every episode has something that makes me laugh.
5,Christmas Present,It was a xmas present for my son and he loved it. Wished it would come out on blue ray.
5,One of the best on tv,This show is hysterical! I bought it for my wife as a gift and she loved it! We watch it all the time.
4,Love it!,"This cover makes a breastfeeding mom like me feel at ease when breastfeeding my baby in public. In fact, noone would know that I am breastfeeding until they come closer and talk to me. The cover is big enough to cover my whole body (which means that it will also cover my unsightly sagging after-birth midrift) and the design is also fashionable.I just like the idea of just being able to put the cover over my head and around my neck and then see my baby from top of the cover (it has a plastic hard strip attached inside the cover to enable you to see through the neckline and have eye contact with your baby) with just one hand.4 stars for the design and practicality, though pricey."
4,I get smiles now when nursing in public.,"People appreciate that I have a good cover-up and thay give me smiles of approval for breastfeeding my child.A nice surprise is it came with a burp cloth sewn into the corner with a pocket. It has come in handy to stash whatever may be in my hand, like my cell phone which creates a weight to help hold the corner down. Also it is nice to wipe her mouth when she is done eating"
1,"Good product, bad service from Amazon",Got the product in the mail and it was the wrong color. Not what I had ordered. Unfortunately by the time I got the product it was too late to return for a full refund. So now I am stuck with an ugly nursing cover. Thanks Amazon!
1,Worst automated customer service ever,"I ordered this book and was sent the wrong book ""Introductory Econometrics"", and the pages were printed upside down with respect to the book cover. Mistakes can happen, so I tried to contact Amazon to return the book. Because there was no available replacement, the on-line return system is an infinite loop, and will not permit a return. And of course no contact phone number is published! The is very disappointing."
5,Great consulting cases,This book has fabulous consulting cases and is written well. The longer cases are broken into parts so you have time to stop and think about what you would do and then read on to see what the consultants did in the next part and what the outcome was.This is one of the best consulting case books ever written.
5,"Gives a Great Perspective on Power Run Riot, and the tragedy of Bush","This is a great film. The CCTV/hidden camera perspective gave me the sense of actually being there, and really helped convey the mystery and tension. The way Bush and Blair et al ran away with the Iraq War is a democratic tragedy that will (hopefully) not soon be forgotten, if ever. ""WMD"" is the first film I've seen that reflects back on how it all went down, and shines a light on the inner workings of the powers that be."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"After reading glowing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to try this hoping it would help my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I liked the idea of an inexpensive cleanser that was gentle on skin. Turns out this soap is gentle on dirt, too. It does not remove makeup very well. After use, makeup still comes off on my cleansing cloth! I have since switched to Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, which seems to work better."
3,These work well but are drying,"I am unable to use harsh cleansers with a lot of chemicals, since they make me break out. These bars are basic cleansers that do the job and I don't break out with them. I don't think I will buy them again though because they are a little too drying."
2,Good content if you can get past the presentation,"This book does have lots of good information, but the author could have at least used spellcheck. There are spelling errors on almost every page, as well as a few missing words spread around the book. There are even a few places that the author copy and pasted an entire paragraph. All of this left me thinking of this book as being cheap and I had to question the validity of the information if the author doesn't even bother to check for errors in his own book."
1,not recomended,"I waited months for this book to have it arrive and be loaded with spelling errors, out dated information and horifically organized. There are sections where the headings have nothing to do with the info in the following paragraphs.It offers a full refund from the publisher on the back cover and I have sent mine back to collect my refund."
3,Good Primer for Begining Growers,"I bought this book back when it first came out, printed I believe on some antiquated machine with a spiral binding. Mr. Taylor takes you step-by-step into the world of growing plants for profit in a homemade greenhouse. Good book to get you started, but you better get a salesman to sell all those plants you'll be growing because you won't have time to do both with his numbers. He' talking about growing thousands of plants to sell to the big markets like Walmart and K-Mart. I guess if you were a work-a-holic you could do it."
3,"If you're going to buy it, buy it used","I bought this DVD used not expecting much based on other reviews. I first watched the Shape of Punk to Come footage. It sucks. Poor audio and video quality. Not even worth a watch. Plus it's missing two songs: Protest Song '68 and The Appolo Programme Was A Hoax. Better footage on the internet. Then I watched the documentary. It wasn't that bad. It's not really a documentary about the band's entire career, just when they started to break up. In between the documentary are three video clips: Circle Pit, Rather Be Dead, and New Noise. Decent quality. I was at least able to watch them over again. Why couldn't the Shape of Punk to Come footage have this kind of quality, I don't know. There are also 2 music videos: New Noise and Rather Be Dead. They're Alright... If you're going to buy this DVD, buy it for the documentary which proably means you actually have to like Refused's other albums, not just the Shape of Punk to Come. Otherwise, don't even buy it."
4,female mma,"I'm the first to review this. I feel very privileged but I'll keep this short. It had some pretty decent action. This is not the best female mixed martial arts I've seen but it wasn't bad. One chick ends up getting her arm broken/ dislocated because her opponent didn't give her any chance to tap. I thinks that's highly unsportsmanlike. She could have very well ruined that girl's career doing a submission that her opponent wasn't about to escape anyway. I don't care for people like that. By all means, do what it takes to win but that was not necessary.PS: UFC needs a female division :)Also, I wanted to give this a 3.5 but I decided to round up. Just being generous."
5,Sad that we need them but GLAD that we have them!,"My son (6) was having occasional bedwetting accidents and we tried these (although we didn't want to admit we needed them). They have been a godsend. These are NOT made for toddlers - they are for big kids who haven't developed their ability to detect nighttime accidents *before* they happen. His accidents are very rare, but when they happen, these things save us the trouble of changing all the sheets (and the blankets and the mattress pad...) and that's what we needed. I even let him wear them twice, so they cost a bit less. Wouldn't trade them for anything - except when his body catches up with his brain!"
4,celtic's t-shirt,I bought this as a gift and my friend wore it right away. They said it was very comfortable to work out in or just to hang out in and I love the way it looks!
5,PIAA Wipers Rock!,"I've been using these wipers for a while now - I started because the typical ""Gas station"" wipers only lasted a couple months. PIAA wipers last much longer - six to twelve months - and perform a lot better during their installed life. They don't skip, they don't chatter, and they do a great job getting the rain off of your windshield. Clearly, they are more expensive than gas station wipers, but this is a much better product."
2,Disappointing,"I have an old Volvo with Bosch wipers. The blades only fit after I did some cutting (not because of the length but because of the way the wipers hold the blades).The silicone coating also doesn't really work. If the car is parked you can see that less water accumulates where the coating lies. However during driving I don't see the waterdrops being pushed away by the wind, even at speeds of 60 mph.Even worse, the blades don't run smoothly so they leave streaks and small droplets on the windshield."
4,Windshield visiblity is great,Great way to bring my PIAA wipers back to working like new. My only complaint is the price - seems kinda high for a thin strip of rubber.
2,don't be fooled ...,Don't be fooled by the apparent value. There are four capsules to make up a single 1 g dose. Seemed that a good value until I got the bottle. Significantly more expensive than other HMB products.
3,Not the deal it might seem,"I can't comment on the effectiveness of HMB, however the value of this HMB product is terrible compared to others. It takes 4 capsules to reach 1g of HMB, and since 3g is the recommended dose that means 12 capsules a day. Not only is it annoying to have to take so many capsules, the bottle contains less than one month's supply. I'd go with other manufactures which offer 1g HMB capsules at a better value."
2,I dont get it???,I have tried HMD before (a long time ago) and thought I would try one more time. But I just dont see that it does anything. The studies are out there but I dont see it. I wont buy it again.
4,mmmmmmmmmm,relly like one fine day &hes so fine really competes with he is my desteny &all the other girl groups of the era short on time musically speeking was sad to here the chiffons hadent sang any christmas songs that were recorded though they may have +_)(*&^%$#@!~a-z&0-9....
4,"THIS AN EXCELLENT DISC.IT CONTAINS ALL THEIR HITS,AND LESSER KNOWN ONES.","THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM .THE ALBUM CONTAINS 26 TRACKS,OF THEIR HITS AND SOME LESSER KNOWN GEMS.THY COULD HAVE EASILY MADE THIS A TWO DISC SET,AND CHARGED A LOT MORE,FOR THIS SET.THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD.THE PACKAGING IS RATHER FLIMSY.THIS KEEPS THE PRICE DOWN,I GUESS. I OWN THIS DISC."
5,"Fate Management: ""If you want the $ , buy this book .""","I received this book at The Art Institute of Philadelpphia as a text book, while I studied Music and Video Business. Before I entered school, I had always been an artist manager. I learned a lot about the industry over the years. ""How To Make And Sell Your Own Recordings"" became one of my most important guide books. It helped me to aquire the skills to do everything myself. ""How To Make And Sell Your Own Recordings"" has a lot of valuable information for any artist manager or independent musician. It helps to ensure that you present yourself in a professional way without the need to hire out."
4,Nothing Like I've heard before,"Ok i haven't heard a lot but the Like is truley original to me. I absolutely love the fact that this an all girls band. They rock, but not very hard. Z Berg's vocals are great. I salute Charlotte Froom's bass lines. If you listen closely, shes really laying them down. Almost all the songs are fairly mellow except for track 2, What I say and what I mean. its more edgy. I would say track 6, Once things look up is my favourite."
3,Pretty good,"this album is a nice album. its pretty good and i like that they're a girl band and they sound like girls, but not mariah carey girly or tori amos. they are harmonious and smooth and you could lie and daydream to this album. its a good album. i only gave it 3 stars, though (i woulda gave it 3 and a half) because at times i wish they'd gotten louder or more raw. and at other times i wished they'd deviated from the regular... verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus repeat sequence. i think they're next album will be killer if they choose to experiment a little more."
3,"I didn't want to believe it, but it is a bit cliche.","So I heard the two songs ""June Gloom"" and ""What I Say and What I Mean"" and absolutely had to have the album. I wouldn't really call it a 3 star album, but not quite a 4 star either. The rest of the tracks on the album are good but they just don't have the same catchiness, they seem a bit more like just average cliche pop/rock. Something that was said here before, but I refused to believe it. Maybe it just takes getting used to. I didn't like Rooney very much at first but listened to the cd a few times and eventually fell in love with them. Hopefully this is one of those cases, but as of now I'd have to say that this album is just a little above average."
5,I love the Like,"This is sob-rock at its best with influences from Blondie, The Sundays and a dash of sassy, punk pop thrown in! Tennessee Thomas, Charlotte Froom and Z Berg are the real deal. (Ashlee, Avril, Hilary and Lindsay couldn't polish the Like's knee high boots.) The Like write their own songs, play their own instruments and wear their hearts on their Marc Jacobs sleeves. ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" is the perfect autumnal album to crank in your iPod while the leaves fall and the memories of summer fade. Wendy Melvoin's production is pop perfection and so is this stunning debut by three very cool, very real, very talented chicks."
5,get this today,"The Like formed in 2001. Charlotte Froom and Tennessee Thomas have been friends since they were little. They met Z Berg and things started to happen. They hooked up with Phantom Planet and Maroon 5. Their music is very elegant. Z Berg is a very talented songwriter and singer. She's hot. I fancy all three really. They are influenced by a lot of new wave music from the 1980s. Z Berg writes very personal lyrics that are sometimes like stories. They hooked up with Wendy Melvoin (ex-Prince and the Revolution). She is a good producer. ""June Gloom"" is a kick ass song. ""Waiting"" is cool too. There is not a weak moment on this record. This is a band on the rise."
4,Good Debut Album,"I have followed the like for about two years. My friend brought me to a concert, and I instantly fell in love with the band. Z commands the audience, having a great stage presence. Charlotte holds the bass. Tennessee keeps the rhythm. The first three EP's captured the young, raw sound of the band. Through growth and technology, they have cleaned up their sound and created this first album.I knock of a star because I personally liked the raw, gritty sound of their EP's. The rare slight flaws in the EP's brings back the memories of the live concerts.The lyrics that Z put out there are not straight forward tales of love and woe; they are intricate poems that stimulate your mind and heart. And the delivery of music by the band is nostalgic of the past greats."
1,Don't waste your time,"My hope was to get a networked device to play on a TV the audio and video content from my PC. This product looked like it would do the job. I installed the software without any problems and I thought all was well until I played my first video. The picture quality was horrible. I thought there must be some mistake so I displayed a picture. It also looked really bad. The next picture I tried wouldn't display at all and that's when I noticed the software server running on my PC crashed. While I could have got a bad unit, I decided not to waste any more time on this product and sent it back."
5,Expensive - worth the price,"This stuff is not just ""vaseline"". It's a really heavy, somewhat oily ""goo"". But after it's on, it doesn't leave your hands greasy. Great for badly cracked hands, dry skin, and for when your hands get wet or washed a lot, because it can stand up to water 1000% better than any ""lotion""."
4,Men of principle--even if it kills them,"This book reads a little bit like a precursor to the novels of Ayn Rand. A group of men espouse almost impossible ideals, and then try to live up to them at any cost--or in this case, kill or die for them. The title refers to a group of well educated idealists at the turn of the century who are contract murderers, but only if they agree that the murder is morally justified. A potential client visits them and offers a contract--to kill the head of their agency. Strangely, the executive, Ivan Dragomiloff, finds this to be justified, sends out the order for his own death, and then spends the rest of the book in a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the men he has trained so well. This book was made into an entertaining, but not very deep, movie, around 1970, starring Oliver Reed, Telly Savalas, and Diana Rigg."
2,"great concept, but","the plot in this book is very interesting. the bureau in question is adminitrated towards killing people who ""deserves"" it. their clients have to convince the leader that the person deserves to be killed. a man shows up and convinces the leader that it is HIM (the leader) that deserves to be killed, and this person agrees at last. interesting concept. but after a while the plot gets less interesting. L doesn't seem to manage his own idea, and things end up just sort of happening. not his best."
2,Does not fit,"This 24"" refill does not fit 2003 Ifiniti Coupe. However the 17"" refill fits perfectly. I guess some refills are wider than others."
4,"Works Okay, but watch out CAMRY owners.","I bought the 24"" (driver side) and 19"" (passenger side) for my 2005 camry LE. the 19"" fit perfectly, but the 24"" wasn't so lucky. The thickness for 24"" is too big for the stock wiper frame, so I had to do some DIY X-acto cutting to get it to fit. As far as the silicone chemical on the blade refill, I did not see any rain drops ROLL OFF the windshield like what others said. Maybe I am doing something wrong.Not going to lie, I am a little disappointed. I was hoping the silicone coating will make rain drops roll off the windshield (like when the giant fan is blowing water off of your car during a car wash), but obviously didn't happen for my case.Other than that, they do what typical wiper blades should do."
2,"Worked great at first, but then pretty much dried out...",Worked awesome as refills for my VW MKV Rabbit/Golf but then pretty much died a fast death after 3-4 months and I live in Seattle where temps are mild and it was when we really didn't have much rain (shocker). Since then have gone back to the dealership refills. Oh well...
5,These are no ordinary wiper blades.,"These are made of a much higher quality material that last a lot longer in the high heat, high humidity of the deep south. They are worth the extra money, I use them on all of my vehicles."
4,I'm not a music expert,"I don't know too much about music. I own over 700 cds, but I don't play music and I don't have much experience with this music. My only point of reference was the ninth symphony, seeing as every other piece in this box set was new to me. It sounds fine, nothing wrong with it as far as I can see.Now, here's what you'll get in this box set, seeing as Amazon does not give it a description. 40 cds! no joke, you get 40 cds in this box set. It features:1. Complete symphonies2. Complete symphonic poems3. Cello concerto4. Piano concerto5. Violin concerto6. Requiem7. Stabat Mater8. Slavonic Dances9. Complete String quartets10. Chamber music11. Piano Works (solo and duet)12. RusalkaAs far as I can tell, the only things missing are The Spectre's Bride and Jacobin. Seeing as it is 40 cds, i have not had an opportunity to listen to it, however what i have heard i have been quite satisfied with."
1,Some of the pieces have poor sound quality!,"Some of the pieces have poor sound quality!Such as Rondo for Cello & Orchestra in G minor Op.94 (B.181), Disc 8.This is compilation, no collection! Be aware!"
2,Cute but I can't use it,"I thought this turtle would make a cute bicycle horn for a kid's bike, but it did not actually fit on the handle bar of the bike we intended it for. Maybe it would fit on a different bike if we had one. Even if we could get it on the bike, it would be impossible for a young child to use it for it's purpose- to make the honking noise. It's so difficult to squeeze that it's not even easy for an adult to make it honk. My 2 year old son likes to play with it, but we will never be able to use it as a bike horn."
2,this snail is nowhere as cool as my firebreathing dragon,"The snail is very like my dragon, and squeaks just the same. But, he doesn't look anywhere near as cool. I think it's something about his eyes, which don't look nearly as beady."
4,like walking on clouds,Very comfy and coushy. Light weight and warm at the same time. Great gift to someone or yourself!
5,Best Olympic Resource Book!,This is the best Olympic resource book around. If you are an Olympic fan this is the book for you.
3,Neat book,"I really liked this book; however, it was more of an almanac than a picture book. Very cool."
3,Interesting and disappointing,"Black Snow is a satirical retelling of Bulgakov's experiences in writing his first novel and play and working with the theater in Moscow. This volume has a forward which identifies some of the fictional names with the actual names of the individuals portrayed.Unlike Bulgakov's other novels, this could occasionally improve by editing - a third of a page of jobs constituting all of humanity is a bit much. The characters are in general very specific personalities in which Bulgakov assumes that character recognition relieves him of the duty to provide fully fleshed out characters.On the flip side, the novel is an amusing and telling romp through the hidden side of theater and Bulgakov's humorous skill is unscathed by the novel's shortcomings. Even well-worn humor such as mistaken names becomes fresh in Bulgadov's hands.I recommend this book to theater and Bulgakov junkies; for others I would neither encourage nor discourage you from picking up the volume."
1,lots of markings in it.,"It came with lots of markings in it. The markings made it difficult to read. Although it came on time, I wasn't pleased with the shape it was in."
1,Terrible,"Exact same hood came in a 10gal aquarium kit (can be purchased at Meijer or Walmart). In less than a year, the lights stopped working, upon inspection, massive amounts of corrosion was discovered. If you are going to keep your fish tank for more than a year, spring the extra [...] and get a quality hood."
2,light assembly broke in 5 weeks,"I purchased the tank which included the filter and economy hood. The tank and filter work great, however the hood broke within 5 weeks. The plastic assembly that holds the light bulb in place broke and cannot be fixed. Like the last person said it may pay to buy a better quality hood. This one doesn't cut it...."
3,alright for a starter hood...,"I purchased a 14 gallon starter kit that came with this hood.This hood is just meant to get you through the first few months of having a tank until you're able to afford a better one (hence the words ""starter"" and ""economy""). It's not great but it's not totally awful either. The condensation/splashing of your tank water will definitely corrode the light fixture after a while. It's also really hard to find good light bulbs that can fit it. The back cutouts are very limiting as to what you can hang off the back of the tank.If you're looking for a hood, hold out for something that's good quality. This one will just be a waste of your money. However, if it's all you can afford, this hood will at most be ""alright."" Not great, but it'll do."
1,Worst hood in the world,This hood will fall apart on you! The bulb socket was designed in a way that it is very hard to change the bulb. You must unscrew the cover otherwise you will risk cracking the bulb (I wasted $20 on bulb)because you can reach the base of the bulb with the cover on. It is not made with rustfree material so after the screw is rusted in place then you can't even change your bulb anymore. It won't last more than 2-3 bulb change. I also think because the design of this junk (everything exposed to moisture)the bulb just doesn't last very long. The whole thing doesn't last very long!
2,Wispy,"The book is a series of lightweight barbs and jabs at aging and women who attempt to grow old with passive submission. It was, for me, a waste of money. I thought it would be a self-help book, full of advice and direction. Instead, full-page cartoon-like drawings were edited with short, caustic comments aimed at aging and the aged. I found it hurtful, both to me and to my memories of my grandmothers and mother."
1,Don't bother!,"Because I purchased the book, I felt that I must read it. However, after plowing through chapter after chapter, I realize that there was little there of any substance. The author drones on and on about his work, but little information of substance is given to the reader. Don't bother!"
5,"Sandra ""My Favourites""","I'm a big fan of Sandra. I love all of her CD's. She just has a great music for me, never get bored with it."
5,"I adoooooore Sandra, she is my favorite","I have all Sandra's albums and I'm undecided regarding buying her latest. I'm quite disappointed that she has no new songs on her latest album. Would it be worth buying it. I have waited for years for a new album, new songs.... I guess I have no other choice, I will get it. Sandra, please write us new songs. Why are Sandra's albums so HARD to find in California????? Yesrterday I rushed to get her latest, and no one had it, WHY??????"
5,A great overview of Kahn's career.,"A beautiful book...It's filled with so much information about Kahn's major projects. Interesting, well-written text and dozens of sketches and model photos accompany each major project. I'd never heard of Grant Mudford, but his big, color photos are beautiful. There's a list of all of Kahn's projects and buildings from the 1920s until his death in 1974, and a section of Kahn's travel sketches and artwork. The pages are large, the print quality is impressive, and the impeccable graphic design, by Massimo Vignelli with Abigail Sturges, suits Kahn's style perfectly. And it's a good buy, too."
4,A Very Good Read,I would suggest this book to anyone who wants a good evening read. It goes quite quickly and has a good plot.
3,Very overrated,"There's too much Hughes and not enough Ovid in these versions--and since Ovid was 20 times a better poet than Hughes, do the math yourself. There's too much blustery, north-of-England grimly rustic imagery and diction here. Ovid was the most urbane of poets, and his verse is redolent of the Mediterranean and the south. Who needs an Ovid that sounds like Gavin Douglas or William Drummond of Hawthornden? Also, entire passages are added here and there; this is a very unsound translation method, and I'd rather read Ovid's padding (there's enough of it) than Hughes's. If you want something of Ovid in English, read Rolfe Humphries's version of the Metamorphoses or even Horace Gregory's."
3,Pre-Foster/Lloyd anthology,"This CD is an attempt to show where Bill Lloyd was musically located prior to his history-making partnership with Radney Foster. Actually, Foster is credited on one track - he makes the zipper sounds for the blistering rocker ""All At Once You Unzipped"". Plenty of guitar and witty lyrics (especially the title track) are positives. Lloyd's lack of polish on his early work and below standard mastering take away from an enjoyable, omnidirectional collection of Lloyd's best seminal efforts."
5,Cute Book!,"I got this book from a membership club I was in as a child called ""Weekly Reader"" back in the late 70's early 80's. I can still remember my mother reading these stories to me. I loved it as a child. It is an easy read but is a chapter book so it would be appropriate for older children. There are only 4 chapters and each chapter tells its own story but connects to the previous and next stories. The characters in it are a mole, a shrew, a mouse, and vole. Vole is elderly and the others visit her. They always want Vole to tell them stories and she always obliges them. In the end, Vole passes away so it may not be appropriate for young kids and those that may not be able to handle death. It does have a good ending and is a good way for kids to learn that older people are very interesting."
4,"If you want an IH data book, this is the one . . .","This little book is great if you are looking for a data book. It runs from 1921 to 1957. This is not a historical book, and doesn't pretend to be. If you read it before you go to a tractor show, you'll enjoy the show that much more because you know what you are looking at! I find it great to read about a particular machine and then see it at a show."
2,Ehhh....,"It's a nice book to have but it's just a data book, very little history. Nearly all this information is on the web. Don't spend the bucks if you are only interested in one tractor. You'll only get 1.5 pages of info."
5,A Must-Have for All Lovers of Old Red Iron!,"This helpful guide fits in your pocket or glove box and goes easily wherever you do--whether it's to old tractor shows, thresherees or just driving along country roads. It describes McCormick-Deering, Farmall and International tractors in detail from 1921 to 1958, giving you serial numbers, specification data, regular equipment rundowns, attachments and special features of each model. The ""introduction"" and ""understanding the numbers"" chapters are very helpful for getting an overview of the line and its history. A chronological table of contents lets you find your tractor at a glance. This book is a must-have for anyone who loves vintage red tractors."
4,International Harvester Tractor Data Book,Good reading at a good price. It's like having a huge pile of showroom spec brochures in one little pocket sized book.It would appeal mostly to a collector going to a tractor sale or an auction that wants to bone up on spec's beforehand. I found it interesting to have when I go to tractor pulling events. I like to look up the details of the machines I'm watching.
2,Better information available,I was disappointed in this book. There is a lot of missing information and the detail descriptions sections do not contain the historical information one would expect and also contained limited amounts of information. There are online sources that contain much more information than this book and would recommend using those sources.
4,"Classic tunes, Breathtaking arrangements but...","... sometimes overblown. Manilow shines in a number of songs, namely the superb versions of Dancing in the Dark and Where or When, coproduced by Eddie Arkin. But his rendition of songs such as The World Goes Round or If we Only Have Love is far too overblown. Had Manilow been a little more restrained (which he certainly was in the Sinatra tribute), and this album would be a five-star winner."
5,SURPRISE!,"I am a musical theater music collector; and when I saw this CD, I was kind of curious but also skeptical. Anyway, I bought it half-heartedly and I was surprised by the depth of understanding and sincerity of this CD. Amazingly, Barry's style of singing seems to fit comfortably in most of the songs. The emotion shines through and true...surprisingly"
1,Insomniac Specials,"If you can remain awake through either of these two sleepers, you deserve a medal. These are both painfully slow moving, unfunny, undramatic, and utterly boring movies. Don't let the cheap price fool you, they are over priced at any price.The only reason to buy these movies is if you can't get to sleep, watching either of these will have you snoring in no time at all."
4,It isn't scolding,"I read this book so many years ago, and mainly because it was causing such a controversy at a school I just had to know what was ""so bad"" about this book.It's a coming of age story where you meet young Stevie, a L7 (square) whose learning all about life and what it has to offer as far as what is a friend? a period? and the big deal about sex?I think April Sinclair did an excellent job, we need books because sometimes mama can't talk to you because she's too afraid! I was tempted to call the school up and ask why the big fuss?"
5,This book really hits home!,This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I read it in High School and It's been in my mind ever since. I finally found somewhere I can purchase it. I recommed this book to anyone who loves books that once you read you can't put down.
5,This book was splendid!,"This book journeys through the young, feeble minds of teenagers growing with nature. The book focuses primarily on a girl named Jean who's an angel, but is often tempted by the devilish prantics by her best friend Carla. Sinclair, in her novel explores the turbulent aspects of opposites attract. Carla and Jean are extremes yet they find a common ground. Throughout this novel, Sinclair portrays our understanding of teenage lifestyle (growing up)... everything from boys to sex to every peer pressure and temptation of a square becoming cool. Sinclair shows how some blacks were not proud of their dark skin and their thick, curly hair and longed to be white. Jean's mother was a prime example of one of those Blacks who disliked being Black."
3,"The book was pretty good, but the ending was disappointing","Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. At times, though, it was hard for me to relate to the main character's mother. She seemed extremely negative and very discouraging towards her daughter. She wouldn't even tell her daughter about the ""birds and the bees"" -- That's what mothers are for!! I could, however, relate to Stevie - a Black girl growing up in the 60's. Although I grew up in the 70's, I still had the desire to be popular and cool, and I hung out with the ""in-crowd"".I was completely disappointed by what the author insinuated about the main character (and kept us wondering about). Before that point, however, I could not put the book down. I must admit, if I had the SLIGHTEST idea about what this book was going to suggest about Stevie, I WOULD NOT have read it!"
5,Excellent!,"I just read ""Coffee....."" recently and it was good. I like the characters and how they were portrayed. Carla,for example,is basically an example of a recent day teen. She does what most teens do today, smoke, have sex, etc. Jean(Stevie), who is the main character, is going through some changes with her mind, sexuality, as well as her body .(What most teens go through.) Stevie goes through a series of scenarios to help her see what her true sexuality is. From a scale of 1-10, I rate this book a 9. The book is good, I kind of didn't like the way it ended, but I would recommend anyone to read it!"
5,I laughed so hard...,"I loved this book. It was so funny to me, and it's rare that I read a book so funny that I have to actually put it down so I can compose myself! The characters were well developed and I could not wait to read the next book!"
5,"Funny, and the real thing","Stevie is a wonderful character with a lot of love, and sensitivity. She is beautiful, intelligent and ready to explore her possibilities in life...the best book I read this summer"
4,A Black Girl Tries to Find Herself in the 1960's,"This is an interesting novel about a black girl coming of agein Chicago. It has some of the awkwardness of first novels butshows promise. The characters are knowledgeable and fun.The takes place in the 1960's, time of civil rights, blackawareness, and sexual liberation. Stevie is the protagonist,growing up with a morally righteous mother and an alcoholicfather, vying to get a sense of herself in her ghetto environ-ment.I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,coffee did make me black,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I gave me a lot of insight on how it was to be growing up as a afro-american teenager, or any teenager for that matter, growing up in the 60's and 70's. It discussed issues on sex, sexuality, race, popularity. I think everyone should read the book. We also can't forget how incredibly funny the novel was in it's entirity. So anyone looking into this book should go buy it, sit back relax and enjoy reading it."
3,Coffee Will Make you What?,"Well... to start off maybe I needed to leave in the times to understand, because I was born in 1985,but it wasnt as good as everybody says. Maybe because it didnt get real juicy like I thought it would ang get into details about certain things. Stevie and Carla was the main characters faced in the world of sex, race identity, and many questions that it seemed like noone could answer. It was going everywhere in the book. Nothing ever seemed complete. Maybe the second book is better."
3,It's Ok,The author allows the reader to wait until the latter portion of the book for the juicy part. I was disappointed since it just makes the reader feel compelled to wait for a sequel.
3,A Cliff Hanger That Hung Me,"Sinclair's ""Coffee Will Make You Black"" is a funny, becoming of age story,about Jean-Eloise Stevenson. In the beginning of the story Jean is a typical child who has concerning questions about life. Very early in the story, readers will discern the lack of affection Jean receive from her mother. Towards the middle of the story, Jean is determined not to allow her mother's views and opinions deter her own when it comes to her choice of friends, activities, and social behaviors. The climax of the book is quite surprising. It causes the reader to put into question Jean's sexual preference during the most crucial moment with her boyfriend, Sean. Instead of being in a romantic bliss about giving her vigrinity to him,she finds herself thinking about Nurse Horn. The cliffhanger surely pushed me over the edge, leaving me more bitter than sweet."
3,An Unexpected Ending,"Although I enjoyed the majority of this book, I had expected it last few chapters to wrap up the many loose ends that the readers mind was left with. I was unhappy when the last part of the book tackled a whole new issue, and introduced yet another element to this already busy story. Though a complex plot is something that I enjoy, and as a snapshot of life in the time may have many components, the book was not helped by this ending.I gave this book a 3-star rating however, and I really did enjoy many parts of it. The civil rights aspect of the book were intriguing, exciting, and the most compelling part of the plot. There is a definite truth in the struggle to stand up for who you are. I generally enjoyed this book, but I think that its conclusion did not do the rest of the plot justice. I have not been convinced to read the sequel, yet, though in time I may choose to read it."
4,DAMN!,"Sadly enough, two weeks ago I had to toss out my AUTOGRAPHED, 1ST EDITION COPIES of ""Coffee will Make You Black"" and ""Ain't gonna be..."" because while i was packing things up to move someone spilled BEER on them! Even after drying them out, they stunk to high heaven. Not only am I upset that I had to throw them out, now I can't read them until I get new copies. Oh well. These books are worth it.Why this story about Stevie hasn't been made into a movie yet is BEYOND me."
1,PAH-LEASE! What a load of GARBAGE!,"When I read this book I was just TOO THREW! I have never read a book so time-wasting. I am in the 8th grade and I could make up a story off the top of my head that's better than the one I read! The plot itself was just ridiculous! And if you want the truth I would rather waste my money on a pinto than to spend it on the book ""Coffee Will Make You Black"". Who ever wrote this book was just TRIPPIN!! I'm actually suprised I read the WHOLE book, from beginning to end. I guess I was hoping it would get better, but boy was I wrong!"
4,"Not an essential live album, but a really enjoyable one","The Rolling Stones have released numerous live albums, some great, some merely so-so.""No Security"" documents the 1997-98 ""Bridges to Babylon""-tour, and it pretty much avoids the songs that have been included on previous live albums (no ""Jumping Jack Flash"" this time!).Instead it draws on newer material (""You Got Me Rocking"", ""Waiting On A Friend"", ""Saint Of Me"") and somewhat lesser-known songs, as well as documenting guest appearences by Taj Mahal (on ""Corinna"") and Dave Matthews (on a great ""Memory Motel"").The sound is very good, and the Stones lay down a swaggering, bluesy groove, anchored by Keith Richards' muscular riffs and the rock-solid backbeat of Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman.Mick Jagger is in fine form, too, and ""No Security"" has got that nice ""live"" feel that you want from a concert recording, making it a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the Stones' catalogue."
2,Is it a rule?,"The Stones do more live albums than most any other band I know. I've always believed that if a band does a lot of live albums or greatest hits that the best days are gone!! We all know the stones have talent and there are a few good versions on this CD. Over all, its nothing diffrent from every other live Stones album. They still sell out concerts because they are legends!! So guys please stop trying to prove you are legends by releasing a live album all the time, we all know how damn good you are already!!"
3,Stones Rock with special guests,"I felt this cd was a solid Rolling Stone cd. I particularly liked the guest appearances by Taj Majal and Dave Matthews. However, I feel the Stone's should have had a wider variety of songs. It seemed to include mostly newer songs and not the classics that we know and love. I thaught there live rendition of Sister Morphine, the classic co written by Marianne Faithfull, was amazing and it is about time Marianne Faithfull recieved the credit she deserved for her contributions. This cd is very good but is not essential to a Rolling Stones fan."
3,"No Security, Not Bad","During first spin i was a bit disappointed, especially in the song selections. Although, it does feature my fav Stones song ever in ""Gimme Shelter"". About half of the songs on this album are from their last 2 studio albums, and might sound unfamiliar to casual Stones fans. Some of the better tunes on this album include: ""Gimme Shelter"", ""Sister Morphine"", ""The Last Time"", ""Memory Hotel"" (featuring Dave Matthews), ""Waiting On A Friend"", ""Corinna"" (featuring Taj Mahal), ""Saint Of Me"", & ""Respectable""Overall, the album is not bad, it just lacks some of their better songs."
2,No Security -- Because Its Not Needed,"If your not a diehard fan, stay away from this album. Ask yourself, ""Do I recognize at leat half the song titles?"" Stick to ""Flashpoint"" for a live album made for the masses! As for the big time Stones fans -- enjoy!"
3,Step right up...,"I was well prepared to hate this, given the usual beating it took by the major rock press, and yes, it's product, no more artistic than the t-shirt or the tour program. At this point a live Stones album is as relevant as one of Elvis'. But this has some nice moments, particularly a pair of fast ones, ""Flip the Switch"" and ""Respectable"", slowed down a notch and given room to breathe; a terrific attack on ""The Last Time"", and a true keeper in the Taj Mahal duet. It's no YA YA'S, but it's no STILL LIFE either. One big complaint. Dave Matthews shouldn't even be allowed to buy a Stones record, much less be on one."
1,Never received,"I have never received the CD I purchased. THe sender has only responded to me once. I have asked for a refund, however the sender does not respond to any further requests. This is my second bad experience on Amazon. I am begining to doubt the integrity of Amazon.John Wright"
1,"""...Don't you think it's sometimes wiser to grow up?""","This is bad. So bad, all I can say is, ""Well, you CAN judge a book by its cover."""
2,buy deep purple newest album Bananas! avoid this!,"yes Deep Purple, another contemporary classic heavy rock band from the 70's still surprise everyone until today with their latest Album bananas 2003. But Jagger and Co - Stones?? they're only looking forward to the money, business and fame!!!! nowadays they rarely surprise everyone! Deep Purple still do their best by making anew album! because they are still attempting musically ""how one still makes a good sound in a album for 2003. Stones never think about it!"
3,Yet another live Stones album,"It seems that every Rolling Stones tour results in a live album. This one, unfortunately offers nothing new or even particularly interesting. Efforts to duplicate the studio sound (ie., ""Gimmie Shelter"") only demonstrate the superiority of the originals. Further, the guest spots featuring Taj Mahal and Dave Matthews are totally unnecessary. This album suffers from too many added musicians, too many backup vocalists, a couple of out-of-place ""guest stars"", and a general lack of inspiration. If you want a Vegas-style Stones show, this album is for you. If you want to hear a good live set from the Stones (minus the guest stars and other embellishments), listen to ""Get Your Ya-Ya's Out"", which features the Stones when they still had the energy and imagination to improvise. This album is ""product"", and nothing more."
3,"This is not ""Stripped""","Having been drawn into buying another live Stones album on the merits of ""Stripped"", I can safely say I will return to my heretofore motto, ""the Stones carry no weight live."" While ""Stripped"" was a testimonial to what this band can accomplish sans all the strutting and preening, this album is a return to focusing on posing and a diversion from musical ability. With the exception of ""Live With Me"", I can safely say, ""Don't waste your money."""
2,This album is another huge dissapointment,"Now, if you have seen my reviews on Bridges to Babylon, you will realise that I absolutley hate their new tracks. eg Flip the switch. What I hate about this album is the fact the stones have to get other musicians on stage to perform with them. We buy the records to hear the stones, not hear them perform with Dave Matthews, Taj Mahal and Joshua Redman! These people don't deserve to be on stage with the stones. Even the perfrmance is below par, especially Jaggar who's vocals are rapidly decaying. However, there is a high point in this album, and that is the inclusion of gimme shelter, one of their old and best numbers. The album gets 1 star for that and another for still sticking to live music and not quiting. Keep trying boys."
5,BEST IN YEARS!!!!,"I was VERY pleased in this CD. It captures the tour perfectly. Best tracks are ""Flip the Switch"", ""Waiting on a Friend"", and ""Öut of Control"". The Stones let everybody know that they STILL GOT IT ROLLIN!!!!"
5,Yes sir!,"This is an excellent product and very easy to install. Basically, it's peel and stick, and provides an instant improvement to the appearance of the vehicle."
2,Not impressed,"I had heard a lot of good buzz about this book and Priest's fine writing style. I was let down, frankly. I found his prose fairly choppy throughout. And I think he focused on the micro at the expense of the bigger picture. Oh, and terrible, useless maps!"
3,WARNING about compatibility,"This Real Power Silent 550WATT Psu power supply does not provide -5 volts. If your computer uses -5 volts, you can have a failure. If your present power supply provides -5 volts, you probably should check out compatibility."
4,Fatboys,"Jack Molloy inherits half of a NY football team from his deceased father, and the other half goes to his twin siblings, ken and Babs. After Jack Molloy finds out that his siblings sold their half to Dick Miles, a successful businessman, he decides to sell his half too. Jack Malloy's friends, employees, and even some of the football players warn him not to sell his half.Dick Miles lets Malloy stay as the team president for a year and Malloy thinks that they will make good partners. when Malloy finally realizes that selling the team was wrong,it's too late for him to take back the team. Somehow the mafia gets involved. There's a twist in the end that i love. This book is HILARIOUs and I love the characters in this book. This book is mainly about football,money, and greed, and might appeal to people who like a good realistic comedy, or sportsfans. Overall,this book has a good plot, but mostly it has lots of laughs."
1,Disappointing,"Our two tables arrived promptly and were packaged well. The tables look great and have ample room for a place setting, beverage, etc. But that's where the good news ends. Both tables have a tendancy to sway and it's a bit like a rough day at sea. If you lift the table to move it, the table promptly goes into the closed position.....that's bad if you have any items on the table. The tables are also heavy and this makes setting them up and putting them away more work than it should be.So shop around and stay away from this manufacturer."
1,Worse purchase ever!,They look good on the internet but upon arrival they refuse to connect. Everytime I tried connecting the wood the whole thing just fell apart. The bad thing is once you open the box and unwrap everything there's no way to return the item in pristine condition! Do not waste your time or money on these trays. They're absolutely worthless!
2,Good initially but problems over time,"Initially this product seems nice enough and well made. Unfortunately, what happens over time is that the leg connections become loose and can NOT be retightened. We threw out our first one after two years of frequent use but bought a new one because there are no 'nice' alternatives. As stated by another reviewer the table begins to 'sway' and can not be repaired."
2,Looks good but is cheap,"This product looks good from a distance, but when you look closer it is falling apart. The top cover was falling off and my particular stand was missing a screw. i had to nail in the legs to make sure they didn't slide around."
3,Review,"The Product was used. the case was broken, and it had scratches in it. But it played with no problems."
4,Quite satisfied,I like the selection of songs as well as the newly remixed versions. They are all great. The only downside to mention is the paper three-fold package... one of the CD pockets was not completely glued and the other one is so tight that it is hard to get the CD out. But this is a design matter. I am quite satisfied with the contents of this album!
3,Some songs remastered with added instrumentation,Some songs were remastered with added instrumentation. This fact is not mentioned to the puchaser. If I had known this I would not have purchased the CD. I want the original Bee Gee's recordings. They do not need added instrumentation.
5,Thank you for this collection.!,"Just what any fan dreams of, the real best collection of hits, two Cd's and both loaded with fenomenal songs, this album has a special place in my personal collection."
4,Just like I remembered it,"Ahhh, this was just like I remembered it when I was a kid! The bonus tracks are good too."
5,Great great Bee Gees,"It's not difficult to compile 10 Greatest discs of the Bee Gees. This one however is a special one as it shows the greatest songs of one of the best periods the brothers gibb experienced in their whole carriere. Adding Warm Ride is the best bonus you can get, wished there were more ! Had this record on vinyl already, everything on CD is more convenient."
4,Bee Gees Deluxe,"I agree with another reviewer who said that this is the best this particular batch of songs has ever sounded. I especially like the clean new ""thump"" noticeable in most of these remasters. The 12"" version of ""Staying Alive"" is sonically superior to any other version I've heard (including the original box set version and the ""For the record"" collections). I particularly like the ""How Deep is your Love"" remix..it's a reverent reworking of the song. My ongoing gripe is that the songs from ""Main Course"" have never sounded as crisp as the selections from ""Spirits having Flown"" and Children Of The World""...a minor concern when you take in the overall quality and value of this package. Buy the Bee Gees and ""Bee"" happy."
4,if you like gospel with the blues,"This re-issue of Delaney and Bonnie's ""Motel Shot"" is a Japanese import and the sound is excellent. There's more Southern gospel here than I want, and that might be why it's only available as an import. If you're expecting music in the vein of ""On Tour With Eric Clapton"" you'll be disappointed. But the blues numbers alone make it a worthwhile addition to your library.It's not the first Delaney and Bonnie album I'd buy. ""On Tour With Eric Clapton"" is a classic."
3,New To Me,"I bought this when I bought the CD version of To Bonnie From Delaney that I had loved on vinyl lo these many years. I read the reviews of Motel Shot here and thought ""how much of a risk is this?"" I love it. I didn't know about it the first time around so this is not renewal but discovery. I liked it so much I gave it as a gift and I'm back now ordering another for me."
5,MASTERPIECE! AS GOOD AS COUNTRY BLUES GETS.,"I REMEMBERED THIS ALBUM FROM 26 YEARS AGO AND ORDERED IT WHEN I SAW IT WAS AVAILABLE. TIME HAD NOT DIMINISHED IT'S GREATNESS. FORGET ALL THE CHEEZY MTV UNPLUGGED, THIS IS THE REAL THING. TO HEAR DUANE ALMANS ACOUSTIC SLIDE ON ""SING MY WAY HOME WAS WORTH THE PRICE ALONE"". THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE CD IN MY COLLECTION. AS ESSENTIAL TO ANY MUSIC LOVERS COLLECTION AS LAYLA."
4,Smooth Organic Soul Music,"This is a beautiful collection of relaxing, mellow, good-timing tunes from one of the finest bands ever to tour America. The level of musicianship is very high, what with Duane Allman, Jim Keltner, Joe Cocker, Leon Russell et al., but the sound is relaxed, mellow, compassionate and wonderful. This is a gem of an overlooked album, mixing gospel, soul, country, rock, and hymnals, that should not be missed!"
4,"What a voice, What a soul",Stigers sings with the conviction of having been through it. The lyrics are real. Not contrived. And the voice. Such purity.
2,Curtis Stigers rocks....,"Curtis Stigers rocks...my elevator's world. What a phony. The songs are a bunch of bunk. Sleeping with the Lights On and the Curtis Stigers CD off! I Wonder Why I ever bought this CD! You're All That Matters to Me, not Curtis Stigers! The Man You're Gonna Fall in Love With is not Curtis Stigers! People Like Us should take this CD off the market! Never Saw a Miracle, and a miracle is the only thing that could save this CD! I Guess it Wasn't Mine, it was Curtis Stigers' horrible vocals! Nobody Loves You Like I Do only when I'm drunk! I Keep Telling Myself that I'm stupid for ever listening to this CD! Count My Blessings that I'm not Curtis Stigers! The Last Time I Said Goodbye was to this album!"
5,One of the best albums I have ever listened to.,"This is an album for all those who love music, touching music. Every song is perfect, above all ""I Wonder Why"" and ""You're All That Matters To Me"". Love, jealously and tenderness are the feelings Mr. Stigers has touched most in this album, using right words at the right time, with good armonies and special melodies. Slow, fast, rock and pop, everything to make this one of the best albums I have ever listened to, and absolutely the best one of Curtis Stigers."
5,Dynamic Relationships is a gem.,I began giving this book to friends and colleagues to introduce them to Appreciative Inquiry. I asked them to read at least Chapter 1 for an explanation of AI and Chapter 2 to learn the Principles. Invariably each one has told me how helpful this book is in his/her personal life. I knew they would continue to read the whole book and begin applying their insights in their every day relationships. The examples are powerful and people often quote them when telling me how much they appreciated receiving this book.
5,A great book by two friends of mine,"This is a biased review based on both the book AND my experiences with the authors.Jackie and Cheri really know what they are talking about.I have seen the results of applying their theories.""Dynamic Relationships"" is a practical way of bringing appreciation into every day life.If you are a parent, teacher, colleague, significant other or community member you will find outstanding suggestions and inspiring ideas.I wholehartedly recommend it.Marge Schiller"
4,A must for the,"Thai Massage Therapist. Mr. Salguero has provided a wealth of knowledge in this little book. I have never had the pleasure of meeting him, but I have trained under one of his teachers, Mama Lek, a highly regarded master of Thai Massage. Mr Salguero is one of the few therapist here in the USA that she recognizes as her special students (along with my primary instructor, which has a sister school with hers) His books are truly a wealth of knowledge! Worth every penny!"
5,Reveiw for A Thai Herbal,"I love this book. It is packed with information that you can use and will not go out of date. It is a treasure. If you have an interest in learning more about this subject this is the book. It travels easily and it is like a good friend , will help you feel better!"
5,My new favorite gift for everyone.....,"A dear friend who has wonderful taste in books introduced me to Lisa Suhay's book ""Tell Me A Story"". I wasn't immediately convinced to buy it but my friend directed me to one of Lisa's articles on-line and I knew I had to buy this book. Now my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner, what a beautiful book. ""Tell me a Story"" is truly a work of art inside and out.I have only read 3 of the fables so far and each time I fall more in love with this book. The stories really make me think about myself and the world around me. I have found through discussions with other readers that we each gain something special and individual from the stories.I am looking forward to sharing this book with friends and family. It is a book I can feel confident about sharing and know others will love it as much as I do."
5,Sublime Piano Perfection,"While there's no shortage of ""new age"" solo piano, there's something about Girouard's music that's hard to describe (i'm still going to try). It's intelligent without being overwhelming; substantive without being heavy-handed. Every gentle composition has a beautiful, thoughtful arc to it. I mention this because so many pieces in this genre are like cotton candy for the mind. They start; they're over and you never left, and you hardly notice.These compositions are at once new yet comfortably familiar and stand extremely well to multiple listenings. There's tenderness and great beauty in every song -- and work together like a perfect massage... relaxing, stimulating and thoroughly enjoyable.He has two albums as well as a Christmas edition. They are all equally brilliant in their concept and execution. Enjoy. He's the most famous pianist you haven't heard of -- YET!"
4,Leadership is learnable,"I like the authors emphasis on the learnability of leadership. Though a little dry in sections, it's rewarding for those that see it through to the finish."
2,How Did This Guy Get To Be So Normal?,"Presumably, about everyone buying Roger Chapman's music became acquainted with him through his great, underappreciated (in the US) 60's & 70's work with Family & Streetwalkers. This disc is nowhere near those efforts. Unlike the restless innovations of Family, Chapman's solo work settled into an uninspired area of hard rock/R&B where the only thing Chapman brings to the table is that incredible psycho-goat voice of his. Unfortunately, the songs are mediocre and long, the band competant but ordinary.I wish the news was better, because I am a huge fan of Chapman's stuff ""back in the day."""
3,Costs more to have it installed!,"I bought this remote start because it was a modular plug in type and not the type that had to be spliced. I thought my husband could put it in. When it came with all those wires-he laughed at me. He's extremely knowledgeable about working on our vehicles/4wheelers/motorcycles/etc. but he adamantly refused this project. It took a professional audio place 4 hours to install it and cost $185.00. As for it working, it does. I lost my ""chirp"" on locking my doors and have to really listen to make sure my Jeep is locked now when I am in a parking lot. The buttons are a little small and hard to work with on the keychain. It's nice to get in a warm vehicle after working a night shift and not having to scrape the ice off your windshield. I just wish the other reviews were as honest about the installation.Kim-Colorado"
3,The Prophet of San Marcos Dump Lives!,"In his first outing as a novelist, Mr. Vincent (an accomplished poet) brings language as lush and inviting as the landscape of rural North San Diego County, where his modern prophecy is told. This is the story of Manny Rodriguez, and his erstwhile band of apostles, who usher in St. John's promised ""New Jeruselum"", the second coming of all the prophets. This book is a provocation to thought, the ramifications of which, are inescapable.Ruth Rice, author ""the wind speaks her own name"" and ""dividing silence"""
4,Honesty is the best policy,"As Rocket, Ranbir Kapoor gives a good performance showing a bit more maturity than Wake Up, Sid. Overall, I liked the premise and the development of the story. However, this is not a normal, Bollywood story - the main character is as honest as the day is long. In this respect, this movie was very refreshing. I liked the way the characters were developed as well as the pace of the movie. I would definitely recommend seeing this one!"
3,Mixed review,"I followed the Amazon and PIAA fitment information to order a set of these refills for my BMW. They did not fit due to a difference in the length of the refills. I ultimately ordered a set of PIAA blades which work very well. I will just keep these refills as future replacements. I give these 5 stars for quality as they handle the rain quite well, but no stars for fitment as replacement for original refills. If you want PIAA, my suggestion is to order blades instead of refills to replace originals."
3,Good Low Maintenance Cat Carrier,"I really like this little carry case. Somehow I thought it would be bigger and so had to readjust my perspective.Until recently I had two growing cats and this was a good size for one so they wouldn't be stuck sitting on top of one another while suffering a ride in the car. It sets up quickly and easily and it folds flat and out of the way when you don't need to use it.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, serviceable carry case."
5,"Midwest Canine Camper Double Door Soft Sided 18'x15""x16'",This is the best portable travel kennel for a small dog! We had our 1st one for 5 years! We highly recommend it!
5,Great Product,I got this crate a little over a year ago for my 4 month old Aussie. Thus far it has held up very well considering he sleeps in it every night and the crate goes with us on all trips. It is easy to assemble and not too bulky to carry. The 37x25x28 seems perfect for 65lb dog.
5,Crate is greyt!,"Super easy set up. Nice heavy, durable mesh all around the unit. Sizing accurate. My greyhound hopped right in and went to sleep! When I adopt another grey I'll definitely get another of these."
4,Great crate but..............,"This crate is great, folds up nicely, has plenty of room and is very well made. However, our Boston Terrier put a hole in the mesh in fairly short order. I'm guessing busy claws were the Weapons-of-Mesh-Destruction. I'm hoping we can find more mesh to make a repair and reinforcement."
4,A good purchase,"I wanted this crate for use at agility trials. I was sick of lugging a metal crate from my van into agility sites. I had seen many of these crates in use by other ""trialers"" so decided to get one. It is lightweight, straight forward to set up, well made, and nice looking. It wouldn't work for a destructive dog, but the same applies to all soft crates. The ventilation is good for warm conditions, but you have the option to cover the window and door areas in cool conditions or for ""privacy"" - helps if your dog is a barker. The only problem I encountered was that the zippers are difficult to maneuver around the 90 degree corners. They certainly became easier after the first use, but still not real smooth running. Someone recommended a silicone spray to make the zippers run more easily, but I haven't tried that yet. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase."
4,Durable and versatile,"This model (25""L by 18""W by 21""H) is just barely big enough for my 50lb dog to curl up in, but I bought it for a 16lb cat to travel from NYC to Texas in the cab of a truck with me and the afore mentioned 50lb dog. It was as good as that situation could have possibly been, and the product performed well.In Texas we added a Boarder Collie puppy to the family, and it has become both his bed and his training crate. I open two sides when we're around so it's more like a bed, then I just zip the bed closed to make a crate when he's unattended.The material has proven very durable: it's been attacked by a bad@$$ cat for 1800 miles and for 3 weeks by a teething puppy, and it has not been penetrated."
4,Space Saving & Convenient,"Purchased this for our Great Dane before a 12 day camping trip and it was perfect. The convenience of being a lightweight, breakdown crate was immeasureable! We used it for transport and for when we put him inside the trailer while we were gone for a couple of hours and it definitely served its purpose. Would not recommend for dogs that are restless or chewers, as it is not a hard sided crate. Our lazy boy loves to just sleep while inside, so it worked great for our use!"
5,Loved it!,"I bought two of these portable crates, and my dogs loved them. You can remove the fabric from the plywood that goes in the bottom, and it is washable in case your dog has an accident in the crate. My dogs loved these crates, they were study enough to hold my 100 lb dogs. They are large- folded up it is the same size as the bottom of the crate. We got 48"" ones so we have to strap them to the roof of our Jeep when traveling. But the zipper locks keeping the dog inside, and the windows are made of strong enough stuff that the dogs can't rip it open with their claws (like my dog did with our previous travel crate). These are sturdy and a good investment if you travel alot with your dogs. I wouldn't buy one to use as a crate for all the time, simply because it is more work to clean this up than a wire crate, plus it isnt as sturdy as a wire crate. but it is alot lighter, and a great solution for travel. Love it!"
3,Beware of nylon zippers!,"I loved this soft crate right up until our 8 pound puppy chewed her way through the nylon zipper. Prior to that, she had scractched repeatedly on one side and split the threads of one zipper. When this didn't result in her escape then she literally chewed her way through the nylon zipper in the front flap. So we enjoyed this crate for about 4 months. Now it is unusuable because we can't secure the flaps with the zippers. So, if you have a pet with a penchant for chewing, this may not be the crate for you. I would love it if they would offer a soft crate with metal zipper option."
3,desiree's opinion,"i watched the movie for the 1st time on showtime. i was surprised the story line was addictive and interesting. i love independent films as well. like most would say, the acting did needed improvement but the story line was cool."
3,3 1/2 stars - small budget black romance w/surprising strengths,"The movie was obviously low budget, and the actors are rookies, but the movie manages to be quite engaging at its strongest points. While it doesn't rise to the level of a truly great independent film like Marion Bridge, it is a great beginning for the director and the young actors. In particular, Noble Lee Lester, the male lead, and Julius Golden, the lothario, brought in strong and genuine performances. The scene where the Christian viewpoint is highlighted seems forced, but I suppose it could be considered simply reflective of the prominence of the church in black life. Though peppered with a few weak moments, the film is a fresh, inventive, and relevant look at relationships and identity in the lives of young adults of the rising black middle class. This movie has potential for a remake with a larger budget and higher caliber cast."
1,Just plain bad,"I try to support black film makers, but this movie was a waste of my money. Bad acting, bad script. It was a waste to put on DVD and I wish I could get my money back."
1,not worth the money,"Trailer coverIt did fit nicely. But the first wind we had, the first. It blew to pieces. Came apart at the seams. Wind was approx 20MP, trailer is between 2 houses, not out in the open. If we knew it could not hold up to a wind, we would not have bought it."
3,camper cover,"I thought I was getting a good deal until I covered my fifth wheel camper. The problem is that the company should have made the roof that covers the roof wider. It barely covered my roof. I added extra rope to secure, did not help. First good wind & now 1/2 the roof is covered. Tried to adjust it & the cover ripped. Now what?"
5,Great nail polish for my toddler!,"This nail polish is beautiful. My little girl loves how it sparkles. It does take a while to dry but otherwise it is wonderful. The company says to take it off with their remover or alcohol, but my daughter's wore off after a week (which was fine with me). I did not purchase their remover because it has some things in it I don't want on my daughter, I recommend just using alcohol (saves you money too)."
2,Chips off within hours,"I have used this polish three times now, and each time it starts chipping within hours of application. I've experimented with the number of coats (2, 4, and 5), with disappointing results each time. At one point, I was sitting with a friend when a piece so large sprung off that he thought it was a cockroach out of the corner of his eye.Also, the polish is very transparent. Even after four coats my nails were still visible underneath."
4,GOOD SELECTIONS,I HAVE THIS MOVIE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW AND DO NOT REGRET THE PURCHASE. THIS MOVIE FEATURES SOME GOOD MOVIES AND I CAN SAFELY SAY THAT I ENJOYED WATCHING ALL OF THEM. THE PICTURE/SOUND QUALITY WAS GREAT AND FOR THAT ALONE I GAVE THIS SET A 4.5. SHOULD YOU PURCHASE THIS COLLECTION I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS AS WELL.
1,The movie cover is deceiving,You'll see Jet Li for less than 2 minutes. Old movies. Complete waste of money.
1,DVD went out after 20 days! Shoddy!,"I picked this TV when I was shopping at Target because, in comparison with similar sized TVs in its price range, the picture was clearest and brightest. However, when we first got the TV, we found that our DVDs would skip at random intervals. I tried to overlook that and just continue using the TV, but last night, we were watching a DVD and the picture froze. I ejected the DVD and tried re-inserting the DVD, and it wouldn't work. I even tried inserting other DVDs and NONE of them are working on this TV. The built-in DVD is SHODDY! I'm returning this TV to Target. The picture is nice, but the built-in DVD feature is worthless if the DVD goes out. Caveat emptor!"
1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would","Do not buy this TV. Simple as that.Had the same picture freezing problem as a previous reviewer; however, it is not due to the DVD player - mine freezes when using an over the air digital antenna. Has frozen 4 times now (twice just this morning) - and as soon as I can find the receipt and put this bad boy into the box, it is going back to Best Buy and I'm buying Sony. And by frozen, I mean, you can't change the channel with the remote or with the buttons on the side of the TV - you end up having to hold down the power button on the tv and powering it down (much like a frozen PC computer). I know that it is not the antenna, as I use the exact same antenna on a Panasonic LCD TV and have never had a problem. Also, it is not a power surge as both the TV and antenna are plugged into a brand new surge protector.On the plus side - this TV has a zillion inputs for a tv of its size...but some things are just too good to be true."
1,built-in DVD player is useless!,"I guess I'm just adding my voice to the choir here, but the built-in DVD player on this thing is the most useless piece of crap I've ever dealt with. It struggles with the most basic tasks and as of today, seems to have crapped out completely."
2,DVD player broke after 9 months,"Bought the TV in July 2007 and has been working pretty good until this week, and the DVD player is dead. Not even 9 months. And it's not like I used it a lot and abused the TV. Very disappointed - it's not like it's an easy item to carry off to the repair shop or return - and I have to look for the warranty/manufacturer/user guide - anyone like to find that stuff after nine months of placing it in a drawer somewhere at home?The TV itself works fine, although a colleauge at work pointed out that the TV/VCR combos of yesteryear usually worked like this: the VCR gives out, with TV inevitably not too far behind. So I'm worried that TV will die out now. Will never buy a combo function TV again.Also, the metal frame around the screen is not well made - you can see the slight bumps in the frame."
1,"Pleasant, but unnecessary......","This single has 3 tracks: The Saint (a nice techo-ized version of the old Saint theme, made for the 1997 movie), The Box (edit), and The Sinner (a remix of The Saint, which lasts about 10 minutes). These are all good songs, but both The Saint and The Sinner appear on the 2-disc version of In Sides, as does the original version of The Box. This gets 1 star not due to the songs, but because now that the version of In Sides has become the standard (and is freakishly cheap and easy to find), there's really no reason to get this anymore."
5,Great overview on the LDS religion,"There are any number of books that cover the religion of Mormonism, but Cares' is one of the best. He deals with pertinent issues that don't fly over the average layperson's head. In addition he provides specific references that anyone can write into their Bibles (along with other LDS scriptures) in order to become efficient in sharing one's faith. Cares' attitude of ""sharing in love"" is also appreciated, as it is evident that he has no bone to pick or desires an ""anti-Mormon"" label. I have only two minor complaints. 1) There are a number of grammatical/ spelling/ layout errors that could easily be cleaned up with a good editor/ proofreader. 2) The book doesn't appear to be on a publisher's current list...this is a timeless piece that somebody ought to pick up. For Christians hoping to have a healthy dialogue with their LDS friends and neighbors, I suggest this as one of the books you purchase."
5,Great Witnessing Technique,"This book has wonderful ideas on how to witness to the LDS people. The first time I read this book was four or five years ago when it completely changed my beliefs on how to witness to Mormons. I have recently been studying it again as a result of Mr. Cares' web site .... The book has been a great help in using this web site. If you have already read this book, the web site goes even further in learning about mormon culture and tangible witnessing ideas.The book is a must read if you are interested in learning about the stresses that Mormonism places on its people. I live in Idaho and know many Mormons that are striving for perfection. This book has helped me to take the idea of Jesus' perfection to my friends."
5,Great Christian Witness Book,"Pastor Cares did an admirable job of not only outlining the Mormon faith, but also giving practical strategies for witnessing to them. ""Speaking the Truth in Love to Mormons"" is written in a very Gospel-orientated tone (something that is many times lacking in Christian books on the LDS church).If you have a Mormon friend or neighbor, and are in need of a starting point to talk to them about Christianity, this very affordable book will not disappoint you."
3,much love to yukmouth,He is baggin. all these rappers out here are sleepin and yuk is wakin them up. dmx will never be tupac and jay-z is only hot because tupac ain't here. stop biten pac!
4,Thugged Out,"Thugged Out:The Albulation is one of the best debut solo joints I have heard in a minute. Yuk comes strong, on deep tracks like ""Still Ballin"" a blazin tribute to 2pac,""Revelations"",""Falling""/f Do or Die,& ""U Love 2 Hate"". Lyrically Yukmouth proves he is one of the best in te west. If you question that listen to tracks like ""Do Yo Thug Thang""/f The Outlawz, ""R.A.L.Mafia""/f Scarface, Do or Die,Tech9ine,Tela,ect..,""Bumbell""/f Tech9ine,""My Buddy""/f Daz,Kurupt,& ""Godzilla"". Yukmouth puts his entire life into this album and dont hold back no punches. This album is for anyone who appreciates real hip hip."
3,I expected a better album from Yuk,"Yukmouth album ""Thugged Out: the albulation"" is a slight disappointment to me after Luniz ""Operation stackola"". Listen! I read peoples saying 'This album is the bomb' and something like that and also read peoples saying 'This album not worth buying it' but for real, I think, this album is an average gangsta-rap stuff. There's good songs and weak songs on it. I think the good songs is: ""Godzilla"", ""Thugged Out"", ""Still ballin'"", ""Revelation"", ""Extortion"", ""RAL mafia"" and ""Bumbell"" (with the extraordinary rhyme thrower Tech N9ne. And there's songs that should'a never leave the studio like ""Machin vs. pimpin"", ""Baller mode"" and ""Menage A Trois"". And also there's songs that is like a regular gangsta-hyped WestCoast thugs sh*t. I think Yuk and Num should'a hook up again!!! The Luniz was tight (but not their 2nd album)!!! O-A-K should'a back up on the map!! Yuk is a talent, no doubt, but GET OFF RAP-A-LOT!!!! Told: 3-stars."
2,Why all the Hype?,"What has happened to Yukmouth? He used to be one of the best most underrated West Coast rappers when he was a member of the Luniz? Now a move to Rap-A-Lot and a new (not so new now) double album. This cd falls flat on it's face. I was hyped about picking this one up and I almost threw it out the window driving home. It features Rap-A-Lot's whole family of over hyped gangsta rappers. Let's face it, Rap-A-Lot hasn't turned out much quality material in the past few years, with the glaringly obvious exception of Scarface's classic the Diary. Yuk needs to leave Houston and head back to the bay and get on some of the old Bay Area Funk. He is making the same mistake that E-40 has fallen into in the month's of late. In short this cd is no good."
4,A Great CD that really Brings out Yukmouth's phat style,"If you like the Luniz and like Yukmouth, this is a great buy. It is a great album featuring many great artists with really great songs. A must buy."
5,Kenny from the dirty south!!!,"This is the best album I have heard in 99 so far. It is worth the money go get it and bump it all day and night especially ""Still Ballin"" dedicated to 2pac. This junt sounds like pac is going to come in bumping and listen to the things Yukmouth says when he is flowing. If he stays on his p's and q's he could be on top of thangs.Check out ""Sacriface My Life"" this junt is bumping to."
1,This is the worst album ever,I wish I could get a refund on this album or sell it to some1 . Yukmouth cannot rhyme.He is a digrace to gangsta rap
5,Relaxing Music,Slack Key is the most melodious and relaxing music. Always brings me back to Kona and the sunsets on the lanai.
4,Good for a multicultural course,"I used this video in a university multicultural course because it provided a snap shot of families from four different cultures. I showed it to my class just before Thanksgiving, and the students were able to recognize similarities and differences in their family Thanksgiving traditions. Watching this video helped the students recognize that some of their family traditions are culturally based. The students also saw that families have their own ways of handling conflicts. A couple of students liked the video so much that they obtained a copy and showed it to their families during the holidays."
4,Thanksgiving dinner movie,Good movie about multicultural living in Los Angeles around ThanksgivingI enjoyed this movie and recommend it for viewing at this time of year.
1,So where's the FOOD?,"What's Cooking was on several 'movies for foodies' lists (ie Julie and Julia, Ratatouille). I'm 30 min in and only see 4 diff families. Well, they've at least put their Thanksgiving turkey in the oven. I'll stick it out for my $2 rental but honestly, I don't see this taking me on any type of culinary adventure to make my mouth water and delight my senses. It just looks like family drama. I'll edit this later if I'm wrong.Good grief.**So I'm back after finishing the movie. A few good looking tables of food is all you'll get here. Weak on food love; heavy on family drama. Because we need more of *that* in our lives and on screen, and not the therapeutic delightfulness of cooking and beauty of food.Foodies need not bother."
4,Better than the cooking channel,"The likes of The Love Boat or Love American Style gets served deliciously in a soap opera drama dish that will please anyone wanting to eavesdrop on American families of different culture & creeds, to see what's cooking behind closed doors, or in the kitchen. Mama mia, if those lovely tables don't look good enough to knock on a door for a free hand out to a lonely wandering soul on this special day of Thanksgiving, when drinking bottled beer, watching parades and football is the norm. There is no boring family in the house with dark skeletons, family secrets, revelations spring forth faster than the bird can roast over a long period of time, not to mention post preparation. I thought I was going to sit this one with a yawn or eyes rolling, but the production crew keep the family dirt flying. Big thumbs up for some of the best cooking money can buy on any holiday traditional table."
5,What's cooking,"This is a wonderful movie! It has comedy, drama and some interesting cultural comparisons."
4,Nice Movie,This is a great movie about families from different backgrounds having their Thanksgiving dinner together. I love the way the Lesbian daughter has to confront her parents and how two families are forced to deal with their differences because their kids are dating.
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","I loved this movie, and when my copy of the first release ""went bad,"" I ordered this re-released DVD. Unfortunately, this copy doesn't do justice to the movie--the color is sporadically off, and the sound mixing makes it very hard to hear the dialogue over the soundtrack. If you can, order the first DVD (now discontinued, but available through sellers)."
4,Families....,"Families & holidays....very funny, great actors, very true to real lilfe. Intertwining of four ethnically different families.....showing how alike we are,"
2,disappointed,"I was looking for a Thanksgiving movie with comedy, since I have only 2 comedy movies for Thanksgiving. I was very disappointed in this movie. I love the different cultural ways people celebrate Thanksgiving dinner in America, but this movie should be a drama more than anything. It showed how society has changed families from a kid keeping a gun for a friend in his house, lesbians having kids, etc. I would not suggest anyone to buy this movie that has not already seen it and also not suggest to buy it, if they want a comedy. This movie has no comedy in it."
1,Sad . . .,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie as an multi-cultural movie bringing in all the different dynamics of different societies, cultures, and beliefs. In some ways it was that, but unfortunately the makers of this particular movie HAD to bring the overall wholesomeness of the movie down to the ground. It was very down-to-earth, gritty, and crude. The accuracy was there but in my opinion it wasn't worth watching."
3,Slight But Engaging,"This four-stories-about-one-story movie about families airing their dirty laundry at Thanksgiving isn't likely to replace ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" as my favorite, but it's worth a look for the great cast. Of note is the always incredible Alfre Woodard; the woman never fails to move me.My chief gripe is the way the film is edited. Just as some scenes are ready to take off, they cut to something else. Too bad they didn't hire Mike Figgis to shoot this in his ""Time Code"" quadrant style.Still, any film that prominently features a dachshund in the cast is alright by me."
1,Could not get it to lather,"After reading a great review of this product, I purchased it. But contrary to the reviews I read, this soap does not lather up well and did not cause my razor to glide any better then using hand soap. Cheap shaving cream does a better job than this soap. The one positive thing I found about this soap is that the witch hazel really did cause my skin to feel tight and refreshed, but that is offset by the fact that it does not provide a good shave."
2,Its just soap,"It lathers up ok but its far too harsh. It'd be just like using a keg of hand soap for your shave. That makes it way, way too expensive."
2,not wow,"it's very thin and tall , I use many times but I didn't observed any differance of other. Therfore maybe with two months ot more find something"
4,makes you soft to the touch,"It makes your skin soft *after* you use it, but for me, its a bit rough. Hey, maybe I will get use to it.. Definitely a good buy though. Bought 1 for my sister."
5,Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel,"This is absolutely the best skin care product I have ever purchased. I don't know how it works but it does. Everytime, without fail. My skin is soft and much younger looking from the first use. I've ordered several more so I don't run out. Also use it in the bath. cut mine in half =half face, half bath. Will NEVER be without this one. I've used expensive creams, treatments in the past and nothing compares to this. Umbelievable."
1,Way Too Harsh- Causes Rash,"I'm not sure why there is so much hype about a cheap piece of rough nylon cloth. Yes, I'm talking about the authentic Salux nylon, made in Japan, not some imitation some here have complained about. I bought this based on all the rave reviews only to find out it's no more than a piece of cheaply made nylon that gave me dermatitis, especially on my hands. No matter how gentle and careful I was when using it, it always made palms of my hands red, raw, dry and incredibly itchy like nothing else.Perhaps a imitation product would have worked better. I suspect a lot of positive reviews are fake. Do no buy this product, especially if you have sensitive skin."
4,April....,"Hi, this is to the person who wrote this review before me. Try the Rave Til Dawn compilation for that version. look for the one with the warped fabric cover that starts with Ottorongo as Track 1, then proceeds with the version of Jump that you're looking for-Hope you find it!"
4,The Fantastic Four & Four,"Monsters Unleashed is a thrill ride for the comic book lover. It takes a new look at what it means to be fantastic and four, and why the original crew is so hard to replace. Taking some of Marvel's most popular characters, Simonson composes a ""new"" FF and places them in a classic FF situation. The dialouge, humor, familial bond and comradery of the original FF is juxtaposed against the tolerant, mercernary teamwork of the new FF. It shows what the FF could be, why the FF remains what it is today, and entertains at the same time. If you're asking for more in a story, here it is. Enjoy."
4,authentic,"Even though Jeremy Moyer is Canadian, he lived in Taiwan and China and studied from folk musicians there for several years. He uses authentic folk instruments (coconut shell fiddle & pepa lute) in this album. This is a great album for people who are interested in learning more about Chinese and Taiwanese musical traditions."
2,Needed more suspense.,"The history of photography was fascinating, the light romance was pleasant, the description of the setting was well done, but the level of suspense just wasn't as present as I'd have liked."
1,Beware!,This croquet set has plastic pieces that attach the shaft to the mallet. These break very easy! The plastic covers on each end of the mallet also break. Definitely not a quality item.
1,Very poor quality,"Ordered online, no hammer in the set that arrived. My money was returned but they didn't want the set back---good thing. First game played, 3rd strike of a ball and the mallet broke at the insertion point of the handle and the head. Second game, 1/2 way through another mallet breaks the same way.We had a Sportcraft set that lasted 4 years. Bought the Franklin set based on description and photos. This Franklin set has some exceptionally poor materials. The handles are poor quality pine and fit very loosely into the mallet head.Very, very poor quality set.For an outstanding alternative, that will save you money in the long run see:http://www.amazon.com/Scottsdale-Croquet-Set-North-Meadow/dp/B0012TN8PW/ref=cm_cr-mr-title"
1,Trashy Foul-mouthed book,"When I start reading a book, I always finish it but I have to say this was hard work finishing this one. It is full of incest, foul language and really not worthy of someone's time. There should be a rating on this book warning readers about the contents. I love thrillers but not like this. It breaks all moral boundaries and then some."
2,Not for me!,"This book contained way too much sexually explicit phrasing which I don't enjoy reading. Writing style was good, characters realistic and the story line was likewise adequate. I did not even finish this book due to the vulgar sexual scenes. I realize it's 2012 and some people may enjoy this kind of writing, but so not for me."
1,TOTAL TRASH!,"I'm no prude! I've read my share of trashy books, but this goes way beyond that! Out of 50+ books I've probably read, this is my first review. This is why... the author needs to put *EXPLICIT SEX SCENES INCLUDING INCEST*!! I can handle all the sex scenes, but I think it went too far with the incest! I can't believe I read the whole thing! I did skip through some of the pages towards the end. Like other reviews have said, ""If you like trash then this book is for you!"" I'm glad it was free!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money & Time on This One!,"I was appalled at this book as it promotes incest! I continued to read it to find out who ""did it"" and was sickened with the ending of this book. As I worked as a Sexual Assault Victim Advocaate for years, I find this book to be beyond trashy, but down and out filth. The main character is first upset by the incest that was going on with her father and sister, but then is drawn into it in the end. This author should never have been able to publish this book. What is the matter with the publisher allowing this book in print. Any young person reading this may thing incest is a good thing, sexy, and exciting. Shame on the author and publisher both. In a world where our children are exposed to so much daily confusion in their lives, this needed to it the bookstores?"
5,Variety,"This was a terrific read. It ties into a variety of industries. It helps a lay person stay closer to the fire. If knowledge is power, I feel empowered."
5,A wealth of knowledge - A Must Buy!!,"The authors do a superb job explaining the applications of wireless solutions for all readers - those very technical and those who are not. The information is concisely written and is not dry and boring. In addition, the case studies that were presented flowed very well with the material. This is the first book I've seen that disects each step of the architecture design process - the charts were a great visual guide."
2,ehh....,"I read this book as a sophomore in high school for a school project, and even then found it to be elementary in writing and in editing. I've lived most of my life about 30 minutes away from where this took place (although I was born way after the murder itself took place) and the only reason I found the book to be of any interest was because it talked about places and people that I could relate to...it wasn't in some town in New Mexico or Vermont that I had no idea about.It's an interesting book if you are a crime buff who wants to hear about the mystery, but the person she basically plays juror and exocutioner for was never convicted - although thats not saying that he didn't do it. As a lawyer you would think she would not be quite so biased against him.Read it if you'd like, but as I said, even as a fifteen year old I found it to be written on an elementary level."
1,Definitely not a page turner,"Most of the initial good reviews of this book were probably done by people who knew the author either in California or in Mississippi because the writing is substandard, especially for this genre. It is one of the worst books I've read. The incorrect French of the publisher leads me to think it was self-published."
3,The Tubes Go Mainstream,"The first Tubes album of the 90s is something of a disappointment due to the fact that Fee Waybill and company seem to have forgotten one of their primary strengths, the heavy dose of humor and sarcasm they instilled in every song during the early stages of their career. ""Genius of America"" tends to be ""message"" heavy and gets mired down in the band's attempt to sound ""current"". For hardcore Tubes fans (such as myself), the album is not a total wash. Many of the tracks are strong MOR material such as the title track as well as ""How Can You Live with Yourself?"" which was co-written by Richard Marx. This album also marks the first recording with a new lineup. Original members Bill Spooner, Vince Welnick, and Michael Cotten are absent from ""Genius of America""."
2,Short On Sources And Facts,"This is sort of a touristy little version of a fascinating historical case. It might make a nice souvenir from a local gift shop, but it won't satisfy any serious reader or tackle any of the important questions the story raises. Were any contemporary accounts of the haunting published at or near the time? (Apparently not, unfortunately). Did Andrew Jackson really visit the Bells? What record exists that he did? (In fact, the evidence to substantiate this seems to be lacking). You can find a great deal more hard information on this extraordinary episode on any of several websites. The attempt to link the ultra-colorful and complex personality of the spirit known as Kate to some lights flickering in a cave near the site today is especially dubious."
2,"Surf the Web Instead, Get the Same Info","I was a little let down with the information provided within the book, most of the substance found could be freely discovered just surfing the net. I was seeking inspiration and knowledge on moving my family to Baja or Perth and this book did not do it for me.I gave it two stars because, becuase the book is written for someone who is still working and for some reason has to move his family overseas to keep his career going.This book covers how to explain to little Billy why we are moving away from his friends, how to tell friends goodbye, what to do with aging grand parents.Overall, this book is not for the finical independent person who wants to move his family to another country. Or the retired"
4,A Candid Look at Vietnam Chaplaincy,"Chaplain Newbey shares with his readers what his experiences as an Army chaplain were like during the Vietnam War. We learn about the difficulties of seperation from family, life for the grunts, the politics of the military and the chaplaincy, and the raw spiritual experiences that chaplains are privileged to live through as they share life on the front lines, on patrol and in camp. Some of the experiences shared are a bit surprising and only add to the enjoyable reading experience. Consider this book as a great change of pace from the usual Vietnam warrior biography."
4,great idea but know the limits,"roto zips are awesome and using this jig saw handle can make the weekend user more comfortable and more detailed work easier...however I must caution that the roto zips and all swiral cutters have limitation and this will not replace your jigsaw. So for thin woods, plexi cutting, thin plastics, light tile cutting this unit will help steady you hands as you guide it with BOTH. (spiral cutters want to pull by there very nature so you will need BOTH hands for a truly clean cut in most materials) That said this is a nice addition to a very versital unit"
3,not as cool as the original handle,it does not have a trigger like the original handle.it does not have a place to store zipbits.includes adapter to fit RZ revolution.straight edge guide kit also works w/ plunge router adapter & original depth guide.
